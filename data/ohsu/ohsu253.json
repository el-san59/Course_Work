The effects of short-term (24 h) and long-term (4 days) exposure of rat liver fat-storing cells at various times of culture to ethanol, acetaldehyde, and lactate on the synthesis of proteoglycans and total protein and on the proliferation activity of the cells were studied. Ethanol and lactate did not stimulate the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into glycosaminoglycans. Acetaldehyde inhibited strongly glycosaminoglycan synthesis, reaching 50% inhibition at 330 mumol/L. The compound preferentially inhibited the synthesis of dermatan sulfate. No significant changes of glycosaminoglycan chain length or of the degree of polysaccharide sulfation were noted in acetaldehyde-treated cultures. The inhibition was reversed by the addition of beta-D-xylopyranoside (0.5 mmol/L), an artificial initiator of chain elongation, to the medium. Total protein synthesis, cell number, deoxyribonucleic acid content of the cultures, and [3H]thymidine incorporation were not affected by the compounds. The results do not support the view that ethanol, its oxidation product acetaldehyde, or lactate are directly involved in the activation of fat-storing cells and in enhanced matrix proteoglycan synthesis and secretion.\r"

Production of albumin was negative. Integration of woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis, although the secretion of woodchuck hepatitis surface antigen was not detected.

HepG2 grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum maximally expressed hepatic binding protein and insulin receptor only at confluence while organic anion binding protein appeared independent of the state of cellular proliferation. When cells were grown in medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum, adult bovine serum or in chemically defined medium, expression of hepatic binding protein and insulin receptor but not organic anion binding protein was reduced by 60 to 80%. Immunoblotting techniques revealed that cells grown in dialyzed fetal bovine serum contained virtually no mature, glycosylated 45 kD hepatic binding protein, but a small amount of 36 kD protein. Metabolic labeling of cells grown in dialyzed fetal bovine serum with [35S] methionine indicated reduced synthesis of the 45 kD hepatic binding protein and the absence of the 36 kD protein. Restoration of normal expression of hepatic binding protein and insulin receptor was achieved by addition to dialyzed fetal bovine serum of: fetal bovine serum; 2,000 dalton ultrafiltrate of fetal bovine serum, or 300 to 350 dalton fraction of the ultrafiltrate. The normal concentration of organic anion binding protein demonstrable in cells grown in dialyzed fetal bovine serum indicates that the low molecular weight factor(s) is not a generalized modulator of plasma membrane biogenesis. However, its effect on the steady-state level of the hepatic binding protein and insulin receptor, characteristic of mature hepatocytes, suggests a role for this fetal serum factor in hepatocellular differentiation.\r"

In order to investigate, in comparative fashion, the factors underlying the formation of glucuronide and glucose-containing conjugates, hepatic microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from the livers of both normal mongrel dogs and Sprague-Dawley rats, and their formation of bilirubin conjugates examined, in the presence of varying levels of UDP-glucuronate and UDP-glucose. Bilirubin and its conjugates were extracted and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography; a new methodology was devised, which clearly separates bilirubin diglucoside from bilirubin monoglucuronide, as well as bilirubin diglucuronide, the mixed monoglucuronide monoglucoside conjugate and bilirubin monoglucoside. At bilirubin levels of 12.5 microM, in the presence of equal amounts of both UDP-glucuronate and UDP-glucose, dog microsomes formed substantial amounts of both bilirubin diglucuronide and the mixed monoglucuronide-monoglucoside conjugate, and minor amounts of bilirubin monoglucuronide and bilirubin diglucoside. Microsomes from rat liver, under similar conditions, formed only bilirubin diglucuronide and bilirubin monoglucuronide. When only UDP-glucose was present, dog microsomes formed predominantly diglucoside and rat, predominantly monoglucoside. The findings imply that it is not the availability of the UDP-glycoside but rather the preference of the microsomal enzymic system for the different glycosidic nucleotides which dictates the varieties of bilirubin conjugates ordinarily formed in these two species.\r"

  ".W": "The biliary excretion of intravenously injected ouabain and the diffusion constant of the lateral mobility of hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins were examined in control (saline-treated) and spironolactone-treated Wistar male rats of different ages (4, 14 to 15 and 24 months old). The biliary excretion of ouabain progressively decreased with age in control rats, the first 10-min biliary recovery in 24-month-old animals being one-third that of the youngest rats (4-month-old). The oral administration of spironolactone for 4 days (10 mg per 100 gm body weight on the first day and 20 mg per 100 gm body weight for the successive 3 days) caused a marked increase in the biliary recovery of ouabain in all age groups. Similarly, the average lateral diffusion constant of hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed a linear decrease with age, as was previously observed with F-344 rats of both sexes. Markedly and significantly (30 to 40%) higher diffusion constants were observed in rats pretreated with spironolactone for all three age groups, compared with the respective control values of corresponding ages. The parallelism between ouabain excretion and protein diffusion (i.e., a decrease with age and an increase with spironolactone pretreatment) suggests that the lateral mobility of proteins in the hepatocyte plasma membrane is a candidate mechanism for regulating ouabain excretion through the liver into the bile, most probably by regulating the hepatic uptake process for ouabain.\r"

Their mean liver vitamin A concentration (2.8 +/- 2.0 mumoles per gm wet weight) did not differ significantly from that in 22 cases of sudden death which served as controls (2.0 +/- 1.5 mumoles per gm wet weight). Immunohistochemical investigation showed a normal distribution of serum retinol-binding protein in the patients' livers, whereas the staining pattern of cellular retinol-binding protein, believed to be involved in the intrahepatic transport of vitamin A, was abnormal. Thus, the number size and cellular retinol-binding protein staining intensity of fat-storing (Ito) cells were clearly higher in the patients as compared with controls. The results suggest that the low serum vitamin A levels in primary biliary cirrhosis are not a consequence of vitamin A deficiency but instead reflect a defective mobilization of vitamin A from the liver.\r"

The patients were examined every 6 months with a standardized set of conventional liver function tests, and a liver biopsy was performed every year. The hyaluronate concentration correlated significantly (p less than 0.001) with albumin, t1/2 galactose tolerance test, bilirubin and prothrombin time but not to serum variables reflecting inflammatory activity. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between serum hyaluronate levels and histopathological changes in the liver. The hyaluronate concentration increased significantly over time in all clinical stages of primary biliary cirrhosis (p less than 0.01), whereas the conventional liver function tests only changed in the advanced cases. The present data indicate that serum hyaluronate may be a sensitive marker for progressive liver damage in primary biliary cirrhosis. Serial determinations of hyaluronate are therefore of potential value for monitoring liver function during clinical management of the condition.\r"

Portal blood flow was uniformly hepatopetal in 24 patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. Recurrent spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy and sodium retention occurred in 4 of 6 patients with stagnant or reversed portal flow; gastrointestinal bleeding was not seen. Standard laboratory tests of liver function were widely variable. Net portal pressure was lower in this group than in patients with alcoholic liver disease and forward portal flow (9.2 +/- 2.6 vs. 15.6 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Wedged hepatic vein pressure was 1 to 7 mm Hg higher than portal vein pressure in patients with reversed portal flow. The arterioportal extraction of bile acid was calculated from the difference in concentration between artery and portal vein, and total functional hepatic blood flow was calculated from the hepatic extraction and systemic clearance of indocyanine green. Extraction was 0%, and hepatic blood flow was 0.469 liter per min in a patient with hepatofugal portal flow and recurrent encephalopathy. Extraction was 20%, and hepatic blood flow was 4.014 liters per min in a patient who had never had encephalopathy. These data indicate that arterioportal communications may be sinusoidal or presinusoidal in patients who lose forward portal flow and that the amount of flow in the arterioportal circuit, together with its efficiency, largely determine the clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Like the peritoneal macrophage, the isolated Kupffer cell is capable of processing and releasing iron acquired by phagocytosis of immunosensitized homologous red blood cells. When erythrophagocytosis is restrained to levels which do not affect cell viability, or less than 1.5 red cells/macrophage (phagocytic index of 150%), over 40% of iron acquired from red cells is released within 24 hr. More active erythrophagocytosis results in greater release of iron but progressive deterioration in cell viability. Iron release is temperature-dependent, the rate at 37 degrees C being nearly 5-fold greater than at 4 degrees C. Inclusion of either desferrioxamine or apotransferrin in the culture medium augments iron release by 25 to 30%, with both agents together having an almost additive effect. Despite its effect on iron release, apotransferrin is not found in sonicates of Kupffer cells, while desferrioxamine appears to chelate iron within the cells. Ascorbate also enhances iron release, but at the expense of cell viability. Neither chloroquine nor colchicine at concentrations which do not affect cell viability influence iron release. The inflammatory state, characterized by hypoferremia due to impaired processing or release of iron by the reticuloendothelial system, may be modeled in vitro when serum from rats bearing turpentine-induced abscesses is included in the culture medium. Attempts to delineate the humoral agent responsible for this effect have not been successful, iron release being insensitive to the presence of interleukin-1, gamma-interferon and tumor necrosis factor.\r"

Hepatic adenine nucleotides were measured in vivo monthly using liver obtained by biopsy from rats while a high blood alcohol level was maintained. Ethanol decreased hepatic ATP and the total adenylate pool, but did not change the levels of ADP and AMP. Adenylate energy charge showed only a tendency to be decreased. Carotid arterial PO2 was mildly but significantly lower in ethanol-fed rats compared to the pair-fed controls. Pure O2 inhalation for 3 min increased the PO2 four times in the ethanol and control-fed rats, and tended to increase ATP and decrease ADP in ethanol-fed rats as well as pair-fed controls. It restored the energy charge to a normal level in the ethanol-fed rats. Ten per cent O2 + 90% N2 inhalation for 3 min decreased the PO2 to 40 mm Hg in both the ethanol-fed and control rats, and this rapidly decreased ATP. This effect was significantly greater in the ethanol-fed rats compared to the controls. The total adenylate pool and the energy charge were decreased only in ethanol-fed rats. The results show that the reduced energy stores in the rat liver induced by ethanol are rapidly responsive to changes in PO2. Thus, the livers of ethanol-fed rats were more vulnerable to transient hypoxia than were controls.\r"

The hepatoprotective effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 on the deposition of collagen and fat was assessed by histological evaluation and measurement of hydroxyproline. Dose-response studies established that optimal protection was achieved by the twice daily administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at 100 micrograms per kg (subcutaneous) or 250 micrograms per kg (oral). 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and a crystalline analog [(p-acetamidobenzamido)phenyl ester of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 significantly delayed both the deposition of collagen and the increase in hepatic hydroxyproline content. There was an excellent correlation between the histological assessment of collagen and the biochemical measurement of hydroxyproline. These data provide a rationale for the evaluation of prostaglandins in the treatment of human liver disease.\r"

No differences in S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase was observed between both groups of cirrhotics. Similarly, a marked reduction in the activity phospholipid methyltransferase was also observed in liver biopsies from the same group of cirrhotics (105 +/- 12 pmoles per min per mg protein) when compared with the control subjects (241 +/- 13 pmoles per min per mg protein).

  ".U": "88113479\r", 
  ".W": "Sera of patients with hepatic encephalopathy strongly inhibit the specific binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid to synaptic membranes. In a previous study, this inhibition of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid binding was attributed to gamma-aminobutyric acid itself, and it was assumed that serum gamma-aminobutyric acid is increased 5- to 30-fold in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. The findings of that study, however, were not confirmed by other analytical methods. Therefore, the validity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-radioreceptor assay was tested. In view of the increased serum concentrations of several amino acids in hepatic encephalopathy, the effects of L-alpha-amino acids on the assay were studied. Five amino acids inhibited specific gamma-aminobutyric acid binding at a concentration of 0.5 mM or lower: glutamine; glutamate; taurine; proline, and OH-proline. Equimolar amounts of aminooxyacetate prevented the inhibition of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid binding by glutamine and glutamate but had no effect on that of gamma-aminobutyric acid, taurine, proline and OH-proline. Aminooxyacetate had no effect on specific gamma-aminobutyric acid binding itself. The inhibitory activity of a serum sample from a patient with hepatic encephalopathy was inhibited by 0.5 mM aminooxyacetate. The gamma-aminobutyric acid binding inhibitory activity of a serum sample of a patient with hepatic encephalopathy was purified by gel chromatography and contained several amino acids at concentrations of about 0.1 mM, 3.5 mM glutamine but no detectable gamma-aminobutyric acid. Accordingly, the gamma-aminobutyric acid binding inhibitory activity is not mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid alone and is most likely due to glutamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded in 176 ambulant patients with chronic liver disease, including 36 patients with compensated cirrhosis (Group I), 119 patients with noncirrhotic chronic liver disease (Group II) and 21 patients with benign structural or functional liver disease (Group III). Group I patients had significantly lower systolic (113.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E.) and diastolic (65.3 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) pressures than Group II patients (125.8 +/- 3.5 and 76.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.0001) or Group III patients (125.1 +/- 3.4 and 77.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, respectively) (p less than 0.0001). Serum levels of GABA, a potent amino acid neurotransmitter with known vasodilatory effects in vitro, were higher in Group I patients (1.12 +/- 0.26 microM, mean +/- S.E.) than in Group II patients (0.41 +/- 0.05 microM) (p less than 0.005) or Group III patients (0.34 +/- 0.03 mM) (p less than 0.05). A constant infusion of GABA into the systemic circulation of six adult dogs, at rates required to achieve serum GABA levels within one order of magnitude of those observed in humans with cirrhosis, resulted in a 17.0 +/- 4.3 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure (p less than 0.05) and a 10.8 +/- 3.7 mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure (p less than 0.05). Control amino acids were not vasoactive. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to other vasoactive compounds, a GABA-mediated process might contribute to the hypotension observed in patients with compensated cirrhosis.\r"

A large vascular hepatic mass was defined by CT scan and angiography; laparoscopy with biopsy confirmed the absence of chronic liver disease. A definitive tissue diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made at laparotomy; the tumor was unresectable. Peripheral arterial and selective portal and hepatic venous ammonia levels were high, and this finding suggested that the encephalopathy was nitrogenous and hepatic in origin. The proposed mechanisms of the encephalopathy are generation of ammonia from tumor breakdown and portosystemic shunting, a result of partial tumor occlusion of the hepatic veins. An unusually high urinary excretion of orotic acid was found similar to that seen in hereditary orotic aciduria.\r"

  ".W": "A numerical scoring system was applied and compared with conventional histological classification to assess the histological outcome in 42 patients with chronic hepatitis B followed for 16 to 162 months (mean = 75 months). Four histological categories in the biopsies were assessed and scored: (i) piecemeal necrosis; (ii) lobular necrosis; (iii) portal inflammation, and (iv) fibrosis and cirrhosis. The sum of all four categories was defined as the \"Histological Activity Index.\" Altogether, 102 liver specimens, including 2 to 4 repeats from each patient, were investigated. A good correlation was noted between a high value of the Histological Activity Index score and several liver histology as monitored by conventional terminology for chronic hepatitis. Among patients with HBeAg persistence, 8 of 14 (57%) deteriorated during follow-up as judged by an increase in the Histological Activity Index score compared to 3 of 13 (23%) of the patients with HBeAg seroconversion (0.5 less than p less than 0.1). Piecemeal necrosis has been postulated to be a predictive marker for the eventual development of cirrhosis. Here, we found that a low score for piecemeal necrosis in the initial liver biopsy was significantly less predictive of a high fibrosis score in the follow-up biopsy than was a high score for initial piecemeal necrosis (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that the scoring system used can be applied to monitor the histological long-term follow-up, especially when separated into its four constituent categories. It also offers a means of predicting a chronic hepatitis outcome.\r"

The isolation procedure resulted in an 800-fold purification with a rate of recovery of approximately 12%. The purified protein has a specific activity of 24 micrograms of angiotensin I/mg protein. The amino terminal amino acid sequence of canine angiotensinogen was found to be identical to that of the horse but to differ from that of human and rat angiotensinogens. Canine angiotensinogen was heterogeneous with respect to molecular weight and isoelectric point. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of pure angiotensinogen revealed two closely spaced bands with apparent molecular weights of 58,000 and 56,000. Chromatofocusing showed four isoforms: Peaks of pure angiotensinogen eluted at pH levels of 4.32, 4.23, 4.15, and 4.04. Isoelectric focusing confirmed the presence of four isoforms. Thus, the purification procedure identified two molecular weight forms and four isoforms of canine angiotensinogen. Isolation of the four isoforms will allow their characterization and the study of their physiological significance.\r"

Phospholipase C activity was significantly enhanced (+87%, p less than 0.005) in 14-week-old SHR as compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The enzymatic activities were positively correlated with the levels of blood pressure in both of the rat strains (r = 0.62, p less than 0.003). Vascular phospholipase C was also significantly activated (+62%; p less than 0.006) in the aortic wall of 4-week-old prehypertensive SHR, as compared with age-matched WKY. In contrast, vascular phospholipase A2 activity was unaffected in the aortic wall of either adult or very young SHR. There was no difference in the cardiac phospholipase C activity between adult SHR and WKY. The vascular phospholipase C of SHR had a lower Michaelis constant (Km) value than that of WKY. Moreover, its pH profile and calcium requirement differed in part from those of WKY. These results indicate that the activation of vascular phospholipase C precedes the development of hypertension and that the enhancement may be induced by both quantitative and qualitative changes in phospholipase C in SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Rat erythrocytes with five different amounts of Na+ content have been prepared by using a new, nondetrimental Na+-loading method (net NaHPO4-influx through the anion carrier). This method allowed the determination of 1) maximal translocation rates and apparent dissociation constants for internal Na+ of the Na+-K+ pump, outward Na+-K+ cotransport, and Na+-Li+ countertransport and 2) rate constants of Na+ leak in erythrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto strain and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive controls aged 2 to 26 weeks. Two major abnormalities were found in erythrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats: 1) a decreased cotransport affinity for internal Na+, which was constantly observed from 2 to 26 weeks of age (mean intracellular Na+ content for half-maximal stimulation of outward Na+-K+ cotransport = 33.1 +/- 7.0 [SD] mmol/L cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats vs 16.7 +/- 4.7 mmol/L cells in Wistar-Kyoto rats; p less than 0.001), and 2) a decreased maximal pump rate in adult (15- to 26-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive as compared with that for age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (9-37 vs 34-70 mmol/L cells/hr). Therefore, the low cotransport affinity for internal Na+ appears to be a stable, possibly genetic defect of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Conversely, the decreased maximal pump rate may be a secondary event, possibly reflecting the appearance of endogenous pump inhibitors in the plasma of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

To determine whether this blunting is due to a defect in angiotensin II receptors, we assessed angiotensin II binding to intact adrenal glomerulosa cells in SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) that had been fed high or low sodium diets before sacrifice. In rats on high salt intake, we observed no difference between the two strains in either receptor affinity (Kd = 1.0-1.2 nM) or binding capacity (36,000-38,000 receptors/cell). When sodium-restricted, WKY increased receptor content more than fourfold to 167,000 sites/cell. SHR increased receptor number to only 103,000 sites/cell, which was significantly (p less than 0.01) less than the WKY increase. The cause of the abnormal receptor regulation remains unclear. Two known receptor regulators, the plasma angiotensin II level and the state of potassium balance, were similar in the two strains. Our results suggest that the blunted aldosterone response to angiotensin previously reported in SHR is due to abnormal angiotensin receptor up-regulation in the adrenal gland in response to sodium restriction.\r"

Rats were fed either high (8%) NaCl or control (1% NaCl) diets for 2 weeks, following which norepinephrine turnover in hypothalamus (anterior, posterior, and ventral regions), brainstem (pons and medulla), and thoracic spinal cord was assessed using the dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitor 1-cyclohexyl-2-mercapto-imidazole (CHMI). Regional brain catecholamines were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection following intraperitoneal injection of CHMI or vehicle. Disappearance of norepinephrine following CHMI was used as an index of noradrenergic neuronal activity. The 8% NaCl diet caused a significant elevation in blood pressure in SHR-S but not in SHR-R or WKY. Endogenous norepinephrine levels and turnover were lower in the anterior hypothalamus of SHR-S fed 8% NaCl than in those fed 1% NaCl but were not significantly different in other groups. Endogenous norepinephrine levels and turnover were greater in pons of 8% NaCl--fed SHR-S than in those fed 1% NaCl but were not significantly different in other groups. These observations support the hypothesis that reduced noradrenergic input to depressor neurons in the anterior hypothalamus and increased noradrenergic input to neurons in the pons are related to NaCl sensitivity in the SHR-S.\r"

Rate of cation imbalance (red blood cell sodium greater than or equal to 7.0 mEq/L, potassium less than 92.5 mEq/L, or plasma potassium greater than or equal to 4.5 mEq/L) was 88.1% in subjects with abnormal tolerance, obesity, or hypertension, as compared with 40.0% in the reference group (p less than 0.001). These subjects were also characterized by significantly greater rates of insulin response: 60- and 120-minute postload levels of 100 mU/L or more (88.1 vs 46.7%), plasma triglycerides of 80 mg/dl or more (89.8 vs 53.3%) and serum uric acid of 5.5 mg/dl or more (61.0 vs 26.7%; p less than 0.001 for all). The rate of cation imbalance was significantly associated with each of these three biochemical correlates: insulin response (p less than 0.01), triglycerides (p less than 0.001), and urate (p less than 0.001). In the total population sample, the rate of untreated hypertension increased from 18% to 35% to 55.3% (p less than 0.001), with an increase in the number of biochemical correlates of cation imbalance in combination with glucose intolerance and obesity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have found in 40 thyrotoxic patients that the induction of hypothyroidism by radioiodine therapy significantly increased diastolic blood pressure, raising it above 90 mm Hg in 16 (40%) of the patients. Restoration of euthyroidism with thyroxine administration significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in these patients, with a fall in diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg in nine of 16 patients. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was determined by measurements of serum thyroxine and thyrotropin concentrations in 688 consecutive hypertensive patients, referred for evaluation and therapy of their hypertension. Hypothyroidism was found in 25 (3.6%) of the patients. Restoration of normal serum thyroxine and thyrotropin levels with thyroid hormone replacement therapy lowered diastolic blood pressure to levels below 90 mm Hg in 32% of these patients who could be followed up after withdrawal of all antihypertensive drug therapy when euthyroidism had been restored (i.e., 1.2% of the 688 patients). It is concluded that diastolic hypertension resulting from hypothyroidism is a relatively common disorder, present in 1.2% of our referred hypertensive patients, that should be sought and treated.\r"

  ".W": "In hypertension, coronary flow is augmented and oxygen balance is adequate despite an increase in coronary resistance. For the maintenance of flow in the presence of and after regression of ventricular hypertrophy, the ratio of pressure and ventricular mass must remain normal. Coronary reserve would be altered if treatment normalized pressure but not ventricular mass or if pressure were lowered too fast. We investigated 42 patients with primary hypertension. In 28 (Group I) left ventricular mass index (by ultrasound) was within the mean value +2 SD (96 + 38 g/m2) of 145 controls and exceeded these values in the remaining 14 patients (Group 2). The diastolic pressure was lowered rapidly to between 85 and 90 mm Hg with two potent vasodilators, nifedipine (sublingually) and nitroprusside, while a 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded continuously. During both tests, seven patients in Group 2 (responders) showed inversion of normal T waves, in lead I, aVL, and V3-6. These changes waxed and waned in parallel with the pressure fall and recovery and were not attributable to alterations in adrenergic tone, conduction disturbances, variations, or group differences in the QRS axis, QTc interval, heart rate, left ventricular fractional shortening, wall stress, rate of dimension increase in early diastole, or isovolumic relaxation. A \"\"steal phenomenon'' or passive collapse in compliant coronary lesions during vasodilatation seems unlikely; in fact, patients were free from coronary symptoms, and the electrocardiographic alterations occurred only in seven patients in Group 2, who had a greater left ventricular mass index and required a larger pressure drop to return the diastolic pressure to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated the effect of five hyperinflation breaths with hyperoxygenation, administered before and after endotracheal tube suctioning, in anesthetized, paralyzed sheep with normal lung function and with abnormal lung function induced by pulmonary acid aspiration. Using a second ventilator to deliver hyperinflation and hyperoxygenation prevented PaO2 from falling below control values after endotracheal tube suctioning in animals with either normal or abnormal lung function. The PaO2 rise after hyperinflation and hyperoxygenation in animals with abnormal lung function, however, was less than that observed in animals with normal lung function. Using manual resuscitation bags to deliver the hyperinflation breaths with hyperoxygenation prevented PaO2 from falling below control values after endotracheal suctioning in animals with normal lung function. When lung function was abnormal, however, there were significant PaO2 decreases when manual resuscitation bags were used to deliver the intervention. These results highlight the difference in PaO2 response when hyperinflation and hyperoxygenation suctioning interventions are delivered with mechanical versus manual techniques. These results also emphasize that the response to hyperinflation and hyperoxygenation differs in subjects with normal versus abnormal lung function. Laboratory evaluation of endotracheal tube suctioning interventions should use abnormal lung function models, rather than normal lung function models, to approximate more closely the critically ill patient population that requires suctioning.\r"

We found that a large number of systems used in the clinical setting gave erroneous pressure results because of inadequate dynamic response. Results of testing similar systems in the clinical setting and under optimal laboratory conditions differed greatly. Four major findings were made: (1) Air bubbles in the monitoring systems near the transducer accounted for most of the variability of the dynamic characteristics of systems in the clinical setting; (2) simple catheter transducer system setups performed better, suggesting that simple \"kits\" be used; (3) membrane domes perform adequately if they are attached with care and according to the manufacturer's specifications; and (4) extension tubing was detrimental to the dynamic response of all systems, especially for pulmonary artery catheters. Fast-flush testing of pressure monitoring systems is needed to ensure the adequacy of dynamic response characteristics in the clinical setting. If the fast-flush characteristics are inadequate, physicians and nurses have the opportunity to troubleshoot the system and remove air bubbles and excessive tubing and to properly attach the transducer domes until optimal characteristics are obtained.\r"

This problem can be overcome by using plasma-sprayed apatite coatings on titanium implants. A very strong bond is formed between bone and this composite material; this was studied in canine bone with plug implants, avoiding any mechanical retention. Mechanical testing showed an interface shear strength at six weeks of 49 MPa with a maximum of 64 MPa after six months. There was histological evidence of direct bonding between the apatite coating and living bone while uncoated control plugs were easily extracted. The results indicate that apatite-coated implants can form a chemical fixation with a strength comparable to that of cortical bone itself. This fixation is far stronger than that provided by current cemented or uncemented fixation techniques.\r"

After cleaning the wound, the avulsed flap is temporarily sutured back to its original bed and a split thickness graft is taken from it and meshed to a 1:3 ratio. Surface dermal capillary bleeding then serves as an indicator of viability, clearly displaying a line for the excision of devascularized skin and correlating well with a concomitant fluorescein test. The wounds are re-opened and, after fixation of the fracture, the viable part of the flap is returned to its original bed and the remaining defects are covered with the meshed graft. We have treated 16 patients with extensive degloving injuries in this way, 15 needing only the single surgical procedure. All retained flaps survived, no other donor sites were needed and the split-thickness grafts took with 90% to 100% success.\r"

The technical results of both operations were satisfactory: following iliopsoas transfer only 19% of the hips were either dislocated or subluxated; the corresponding figure for the osteotomy was 12%. Thus varus-rotation osteotomy with psoas division, adductor tenotomy and anterior obturator neurectomy was at least as effective in stabilising the hip as iliopsoas transfer. Nevertheless 80% of the latter and 61% of the osteotomy patients relied on wheelchairs for mobility.\r"

When graded on the Charnley scale there was an average score of 5.86 for pain, 5.96 for function and 5.9 for range of movement, which compares favourably with cemented replacements. The deep infection rate was zero, and the revision rate 1.5% for the whole series. Erosive problems occurred with the smaller acetabular components and the reasons are discussed. The ease and success of exchange have been maintained.\r"

The rate of revision and risk factors were evaluated by survivorship analysis. The overall cumulative revision rates were 11%, 14% and 19% after 8, 10, and 14 years respectively. When prophylactic antibiotics were not used, there was a significant risk of revision for infection. The risk of revision for mechanical loosening of both the acetabular and femoral components was significantly increased for men, younger patients, and if a snap-fit prosthesis with a 35 mm head and short wedged stem was used. The survivorship findings were validated by multivariate statistical analysis.\r"

There was one case of bone infection and no delayed union. Complications were minimal, the most common being minor skin ulceration caused by the ends of the rods. A surprising feature was the low incidence of growth changes, with a mean lengthening of only 1.2 mm after an average follow-up of 22 months. Compared with conservative treatment, ESIN obviates the need for prolonged bed rest and is thus particularly advantageous for treating children.\r"

We devised a computer program to calculate the distance separating any pair of points, one on each bone, for various cruciate attachments at various angles of flexion. The parameters for the linkage in four cadaveric knees were obtained by marking the centre of attachment of the cruciate ligaments with tacks and taking lateral radiographs. The movements of the bones were then calculated, in the computer model, for various attachments of \"replacement\" ligament fibres, the distance between the attachment sites being plotted against the angle of flexion. It was then possible to define zones around the isometric attachment points within which changes in length would be predictable. Our results show that the position of the femoral sites of attachment of both anterior and posterior cruciate replacement was more critical than that of the tibial attachments.\r"

The electroencephalogram was used as the sole determinant for the use of a carotid shunt in 386 carotid endarterectomies. With clamping of the internal carotid artery, 51 (13%) had electroencephalographic changes. The most common electroencephalographic change (60%) was rapid, ipsilateral attenuation of background activity. In the 30 day follow up period there were 3 deaths (0.7%) and 11 strokes (2.5%). Two patients (0.5%) had intraoperative strokes. The combined morbidity and mortality was 2.8% (12 of 427). Neurologic complications increased significantly with contralateral carotid occlusion. The electroencephalogram correlated well with neurological deficits occurring in surgery, but stump pressures neither correlated with neurological deficits nor electroencephalographic changes. Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring during carotid endarterectomy is an effective method of determining significant cerebral ischemia and the need for a carotid shunt.\r"

  ".W": "The role of lumbar sympathectomy and distal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in preventing rethrombosis of femoral arteries with intimal injury and poor run-off was studied in 21 dogs. Femoral artery thrombosis was induced by endothelial lesion in all animals (phase 1) and 24 hours later the arterial flow was restored by thrombectomy. The dogs were then randomly allocated into 3 experimental groups: control, sympathectomy, and AVF (phase 2). Critical stenosis of the popliteal artery was then created by a partially occluding ligature in all animals in order to simulate poor run-off. After 24 hours the femoral arteries were studied for the presence of rethrombosis (phase 3). At the end of phase 2 and during phase 3, femoral pressure and flow, fluorescein circulation time and paw temperature were measured, and arteriography was done. Arterial rethrombosis was significantly prevented in the AVF group (6/7) when compared to the control group (2/7) or the sympathectomy group (1/7). These data suggest an effective action of an adjuvant AVF, but not of sympathectomy in preventing rethrombosis after thrombectomy in arteries with poor run-off.\r"

Initial conservative treatment has been suggested to reduce the mortality rate, but the indications for such treatment are poorly defined. This analysis of 201 patients with acute arterial embolism or thrombosis demonstrates that advanced age, recent myocardial infarction, and proximal occlusions are associated with a high mortality rate after arterial thromboembolectomy. Operations performed 13-24 hours after the onset of ischemia, arteriosclerosis in the occluded artery and poor distal backbleeding after completion of thromboembolectomy were also associated with an increased mortality rate, whereas surprisingly the presence of pre-existing cardiac disease, recent myocardial infarction excluded, was not. The present findings suggest that the prognosis quoad vitam after arterial thromboembolectomy is influenced by limb ischemia itself and possibly also by the revascularization procedure. It is suggested that the severity of limb ischemia and an assessment of cardiac function should determine the initial treatment: conservative treatment, or early attempts at revascularization.\r"

There was no significant difference in the peak velocity increase produced by the three devices in normals and abnormals; however, there were differences in the mean velocity increases. The devices worked as well on postphlebitic legs as on normal ones. Correct cuff application was more critical than indicated by the manufacturers, suggesting that some of the failures of intermittent pneumatic compression may have resulted from improper cuff placement. The results show that different designs of intermittent pneumatic compression equipment accelerate venous flow in the leg.\r"

There was only one recurrence observed at 19 months which was successfully treated by segmental resection of the infected graft and insertion of a new prosthesis through the obturator canal. No recurrence was observed among the other patients as judged by clinical observation and biological tests for inflammation, echotomography, CT scan and indium scintigraphy. The treatment of choice for an infected prosthesis should be removal of the graft and extra-anatomic bypass in the majority of cases. However in some situations, excision of the wound and myoplasty using the sartorius muscle may be of some value and needs further evaluation.\r"

Eight CPS were documented. All CPS developed in the subcutaneous location of the PTFE graft. Biochemical analysis of the seroma fluid and pathological findings implicate the source of the contents as being due to a local defect in the PTFE graft. CPS can make angioaccess difficult, cause discomfort by mass effect, and as in two patients, occlude a graft. Non-operative therapy was ineffective. Removal of the contents and as much of the pseudocapsule as possible was effective with only a single small recurrence.\r"

  ".U": "88115548\r", 
  ".W": "To help define the role of non-invasive carotid testing, all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy between January 1/1978 and December 31/1983 were reviewed. In late 1979, non-invasive carotid tests became available. No significant changes in the indications for carotid endarterectomy occurred in this interval, and all carotid patients were investigated with arteriography prior to operation. In this setting, we investigated the role, if any, of the carotid laboratory. Within two years of introduction, 1200 carotid tests were performed annually, a level which remained stable. It was found that the percentage of patients with significant lesions at arteriography increased, and the proportion of patients progressing to surgery after arteriography went up by 50%. Remarkably, the number of arteriograms did not increase in this interval. The present ratio of non-invasive studies to angiograms is 12:1, but when this ratio was only 4.6:1 in 1980, the increased yield of surgery following angiography was already noted. These results indicate that the non-invasive tests increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, place relatively fewer patients at risk from angiography, and are readily accepted and used by clinical staff even when angiography is used to evaluate all possible operative candidates. The results suggest that these benefits can be realized when non-invasive tests are ordered when necessary after careful clinical evaluation, and that their use as a screening measure in all patients with possible cerebrovascular disease may not be necessary.\r"

We found the increase in central venous blood temperature to be dependent on the individual exercise capacity and work load performed. The maximum temperature increase seen was 1.7 degrees Celsius. Subjects with lower physical fitness showed a more pronounced increase in temperature and heart rate compared to more physically fit subjects at the same work load. Due to its close relationship to metabolic and circulatory parameters, central venous blood temperature represents an appropriate signal to control the rate of physiological pacemaker systems. A special algorithm also using the initial dip for rate control has been incorporated into a pacemaker system, that is currently under clinical investigation (Intermedics NOVA MR).\r"

To assess the validity of this suggestion we have reviewed our experience of these procedures at The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London from 1969-1983. In that time 48 patients have undergone surgery; in 23 repair was practicable (Group A) and in 25 replacement of the MV was required (Group B). Group A patients were slightly older than group B patients (5.9 +/- 1.0 years (SEM) vs 3.6 +/- 0.5 years). Bjork Shiley valves were the predominant prosthesis used. Overall mortality was 33%, with 17% in Group A and 48% in Group B. Hospital mortality was 4.5% in Group A and 28% in Group B. Actuarial survival for Group A was 90% at 1 year, and 75% at 2 and 5 years; for Group B it was 52% at 1 and 2 years and 42% at 5 years. Mortality was significantly higher in those aged less than 5 years. Four patients in Group A have required re-operation, in 3 valve replacement was required; 2 of these died in hospital. One patient in Group B has required reoperation for valve-related thromboembolism. Three patients are awaiting replacement of calcified bioprostheses. These data support the concept that repair of MV should be performed where possible. The severity of the anomalies was greater in Group B and a rethink as to whether valve replacement is the best option for severe mitral stenosis in those aged less than 5 years seems indicated, in view of the very high mortality.\r"

This study was conducted to characterize the adenylate cyclase of cytotrophoblasts and to examine the effects of agents that stimulate adenylate cyclase on hCG secretion. Adenylate cyclase activity was detected in purified cytotrophoblasts, as were membrane-bound stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins, Gs and Gi. Adenylate cyclase was stimulated by MnCl2 and MgCl2, and the effects of MgCl2 were amplified by the GTP analog guanylylimidodiphosphate. Cholera toxin stimulated both cAMP and hCG production by cultured cytotrophoblasts, confirming the coupling of Gs to the adenylate cyclase. Forskolin also stimulated adenylate cyclase, cAMP synthesis, and hCG secretion. Pertussis toxin did not affect hCG secretion in either the absence or presence of forskolin. 8-Bromo-cAMP stimulated cytotrophoblast protein kinase activity, resulting in the increased phosphorylation of a protein with a mol wt of about 70,000, and produced a marked stimulation of hCG secretion. Our findings suggest that the level of expression of adenylate cyclase activity is one determinant of the endocrine function of the differentiating trophoblast.\r"

Five men who had adrenergic symptoms during hypoglycemia and no severe hypoglycemic accidents (coma, seizures) (group A) and five men who had repeated severe hypoglycemic accidents but lack of adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia (group B) were studied. The mean resting plasma epinephrine was lower in group B (147 +/- 22 pmol/L, SEM) than in group A (398 +/- 98 pmol/L, P less than 0.02). On standing plasma epinephrine increased significantly in both groups. During hypoglycemia blood glucose decreased identically in the two groups; plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine increased significantly and to the same extent in both groups; the mean maximal heart rate was significantly greater in group A than in group B. Isoproterenol sensitivity (defined as the dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min) was lower in group B (5.87 +/- 1.12 micrograms) than in group A (2.37 +/- 0.22 micrograms, P less than 0.01). The group B patients had significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms during insulin-induced hypoglycemia than did group A patients. We conclude that decreased beta-adrenergic sensitivity contributes to the lack of adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The putative stimulation of adrenal steroid production by immunoglobulins (Igs) of five patients with pigmented adrenocortical micronodular dysplasia and clinical Cushing's syndrome was investigated. Ascorbate depletion, a process linked to steroid production, was measured by a cyto-chemical bioassay employing guinea pig adrenal explants in organ culture and exposed to IgG from the patients and normal subjects. We also measured cortisol production by these segments during a 5-h culture period using a RIA. For positive reference values we studied the effects of ACTH-(1-39), ACTH-(1-24), ACTH-(11-24), and ACTH-(18-39) on in vitro ascorbate depletion and cortisol production. Both ACTH-(1-39) and ACTH-(1-24) depleted ascorbate and stimulated cortisol production in adrenal cells. The dose-response kinetics of the peptides were bell-shaped; maximal responses were reached in both instances at 1 fmol/L to 10 pmol/L. In all tests, stimulation of in vitro cortisol production was paralleled by ascorbate depletion. ACTH-(18-39) also stimulated ascorbate depletion and cortisol production, but at one concentration only (100 fmol/L), and TSH and LH had no effect. Protein-A-Sepharose-purified IgG preparations of the five patients stimulated ascorbate depletion and/or cortisol production in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the responses occurred over a narrow concentration range (15-150 micrograms IgG/mL culture fluid). These observations support the hypothesis that the hypercortisolism of the syndrome of pigmented adrenocortical micronodular dysplasia is due to circulating Igs that stimulate adrenal steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The salivary cortisol concentration is an excellent indicator of the plasma free cortisol concentration. To establish its normal and pathological ranges, salivary cortisol concentrations were measured in 101 normal adults, 18 patients with Cushing's syndrome, and 21 patients with adrenal insufficiency. The normal subjects had a mean (+/- SEM) salivary cortisol concentration of 15.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/L (range, 10.2-27.3) at 0800 h and 3.9 +/- 0.2 nmol/L (range, 2.2-4.1) at 2000 h (n = 20). The mean value 60 min after ACTH administration in 58 normal subjects was 52.2 +/- 2.2 nmol/L (range, 23.5-99.4), and it was 1.4 +/- 1.1 nmol/L (range, 1.6-3) at 0800 h in 23 normal subjects given 1 mg dexamethasone 8 h earlier. In patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (n = 21) the mean salivary cortisol level was 7.5 +/- 0.4 nmol/L (range, 1.9-21.8) 60 min after ACTH. In patients with Cushing's syndrome (n = 7), the mean value after the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test was 16.1 +/- 7.8 nmol/L (range, 5.8-66.8). No overlap was found between the values in the normal subjects and those in the patients during the dynamic tests. Discrepancies between salivary and total plasma cortisol were found in 8 patients with adrenal insufficiency, which may be explained by the effects of drugs such as thyroid hormones, Op'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and psychotropic agents. We conclude that salivary cortisol measurements are an excellent index of plasma free cortisol concentrations. They circumvent the physiological, pathological, and pharmacological changes due to corticosteroid-binding globulin alterations and offer a practical approach to assess pituitary-adrenal function.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the role of estrogens on LH pulse modulation in men in two ways. Firstly, we compared LH pulse frequency and amplitude in 13 normal men before and after 6 weeks administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily). Secondly, we compared LH pulse frequency and amplitude between a group of 10 agonadal men not receiving sex steroid treatment and a group of 9 agonadal men (male to female transsexuals) continuously treated with 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/day. Tamoxifen administration to normal men resulted in a significant rise in the mean serum LH level from 5.7 +/- 1.3 (+/- SD) to 10.1 +/- 2.4 U/L, which was associated with significant increases in LH pulse frequency (from 4.2 +/- 1.5 to 5.8 +/- 1.7/7 h) and LH pulse amplitude (from 3.8 +/- 0.9 to 4.6 +/- 0.7 U/L). In the group of agonadal men the mean LH pulse frequency was 6.8 +/- 1.5/7 h, while it was 5.9 +/- 1.7/7 h in the estrogen-treated agonadal group (P = NS). The mean serum LH level and LH pulse amplitude were, however, significantly lower in the estrogen-treated agonadal men than in the agonadal men (14.7 +/- 7.0 vs. 34.3 +/- 8.6 and 4.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 7.4 +/- 1.8 U/L, respectively). We conclude that estrogens reduce basal LH levels and LH pulse amplitude. With regard to the modulation of LH pulse frequency our data provide contradictory results. While an antiestrogen increased LH pulse frequency in normal men, estrogen alone produced no change in LH pulse frequency in agonadal men. The study design in the agonadal men ignores the possible interaction of the two major testicular hormones (estradiol and testosterone) on gonadotropin secretion. Therefore, a possible explanation for this discrepancy in the effects of antiestrogen and estrogen could be an interaction between estrogens and androgens on gonadotropin secretion at the level of the LHRH pulse generator.\r"

Thyroid abnormalities were determined by physical examination, scintiscans, and measurements of serum free T4 index, TSH, and thyroid microsomal antibodies. Thyroid nodules were diagnosed in 7.7% of the exposed and 4.2% of the comparison group (prevalence ratio, 1.8; 90% confidence interval 0.6-5.7). Autoimmune thyroid disease was diagnosed in 15.2% of the exposed and 6.9% of the comparison group (prevalence ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-6.2). No salivary tumors were detected. Two exposed women and 1 comparison woman had primary hyperparathyroidism. Although absorbed dose to the thyroid could not be precisely determined, approximately 60 rads would be expected to yield the observed excess of thyroid nodules. While the prevalence ratios were not significantly increased in the exposed group, the results suggest that susceptibility of the thyroid to nodules from cumulative radiation doses of this magnitude could be increased even when the doses are accumulated over years and that such x-ray exposure of the thyroid gland may predispose the patient to the development of autoimmune disease.\r"

It participates in steroidogenesis as an electron transport intermediate for mitochondrial cytochromes P450, including P450scc, the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. Using a human adrenodoxin cDNA probe recently cloned in our laboratory, we examined the distribution and hormonal regulation of adrenodoxin mRNA in a variety of steroidogenic tissues. Adrenodoxin mRNA was found in all steroidogenic tissues examined. In human fetal testes, adrenodoxin mRNA was more abundant in early gestation, diminishing toward midterm in a pattern closely similar to that we reported previously for P450scc. Unlike P450scc, however, significant amounts of adrenodoxin mRNA were detected in human fetal ovaries, with no discernible gestation-dependent change. The abundance of adrenodoxin mRNA was increased in cultured human granulosa cells by treatment with hCG, FSH, cAMP, and cholera toxin. In human fetal adrenal cells, ACTH and cAMP stimulated accumulation of adrenodoxin mRNA, while in cultured human fetal testicular cells and cultured fetal rhesus monkey ovarian cells, both hCG and cAMP stimulated accumulation of adrenodoxin mRNA. In all of these systems, the accumulation of adrenodoxin mRNA closely paralleled the response of P450scc. These data suggest that the genes for these functionally related but structurally unrelated proteins are regulated in a coordinate manner.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulatory cholinergic pathways participate in the regulation of GH release, and cholinergic receptor antagonists inhibit GH secretion in normal man. Whether similar mechanisms are active in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes is not known, yet this is of potential importance since GH hypersecretion has been implicated in both the acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. To address this question we studied the effects of cholinergic receptor blockade on stimulated GH release in 18 type I diabetic men. Paired tests were performed using 1 of 2 different stimuli (30 g arginine, iv, or physical exercise for 30 min) with or without prior administration of the selective cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (30 mg, iv). Arginine elicited a mean peak serum GH level of 9.0 +/- 1.9 (+/- SEM) micrograms/L, which was completely suppressed by pirenzepine (1.5 +/- 0.4 micrograms/L; n = 8; P less than 0.01). Blood glucose rose after arginine infusion and was not affected by pirenzepine. Serum GH levels rose during physical exercise to a mean peak of 7.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L, which was abolished by pirenzepine (1.2 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L; n = 10; P less than 0.01). Blood glucose was not influenced by pirenzepine. Two subjects had no serum GH response to exercise. We conclude that GH secretion in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes, as in normal subjects, is modulated by cholinergic pathways and is responsive to pharmacological suppression by muscarinic receptor blockade. This may have implications for therapeutic trials designed to lower elevated GH levels in subjects with diabetes mellitus.\r"

This enzyme is remarkably sex steroid sensitive; its activity is increased by treatment with androgens and androgenic progestins but decreased by estrogens. Hepatic lipase also is regulated by endogenous estradiol, but less is known about its regulation by endogenous androgens. We measured serum lipoproteins and postheparin plasma hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase activities in relation to sex steroids in 13 boys in whom testicular sex steroid production was stimulated by 4 injections of hCG given at 3-day intervals. Serum testosterone, but not estradiol, concentrations increased in 8 boys (group I, prepubertal and early pubertal boys), whereas in 5 boys both testosterone and estrogen concentrations increased concomitantly (group II, pubertal boys). Postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity increased by 34% (P less than 0.001) in group I, but did not change in group II. Serum HDL cholesterol concentrations did not change during hCG stimulation. However, postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity correlated inversely with serum HDL (r = -0.34; P less than 0.05) and HDL2 cholesterol levels (r = -0.51; P less than 0.001), and the changes in HDL2 levels and hepatic lipase activity were inversely related (r = -0.63; P less than 0.05). Postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity decreased during hCG stimulation. Its activity was positively related to HDL (r = 0.47; P less than 0.05) and HDL2 cholesterol levels (r = 0.54; P less than 0.001). These results suggest that endogenous androgens and estrogens are involved in the regulation of postheparin plasma lipase activities and serum HDL cholesterol concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "To define the physiological relationships between episodic progesterone and LH release, we measured serum progesterone and LH concentrations in blood sampled at 10-min intervals for 24 h in seven young women in the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The resultant time series were assessed further by Fourier transformation, Cluster analysis, and cross-correlation analysis with autoregressive modeling. These techniques permitted an examination of circadian rhythms, discrete (ultradian) pulse properties, and simultaneous or lagged correlations between progesterone and LH release. We found the following. 1) Both serum LH and progesterone concentrations had significant circadian periodicities, with similar acrophases (times of maximal nyctohemeral values). LH and progesterone also manifested multiple ultradian rhythms of similar periodicities (range, 48-241 min). 2) Discrete serum progesterone peaks occurred at a mean interpulse interval of 118 +/- 12 (+/- SE) min, had durations of 92 +/- 12 min, and had incremental amplitudes of 4.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL (14 +/- 3 nmol/L). The frequency and duration characteristics of the progesterone and LH peaks were not significantly different, but progesterone fractional peak amplitudes were one quarter those of LH pulses. 3) Fractional progesterone peak amplitudes in the seven women correlated inversely (r = -0.811) with 24-h mean LH concentrations, suggesting a negative feedback relationship between progesterone and LH release. 4) LH and progesterone interpulse intervals both exhibited significant nyctohemeral variations, with diurnal amplitudes of 73 +/- 12 min for LH and 43 +/- 8.9 min for progesterone (P less than 0.01). 5) Significant positive cross-correlations existed in all seven women between serum LH and progesterone concentrations considered simultaneously and at progesterone time lags of 10-50 min. By autoregressive modeling, the later (20-50 min) cross-correlations could be accounted for by sustained autocorrelations in the individual progesterone and LH time series and significant cross-correlations between LH and simultaneous progesterone concentrations and between LH and 10-min lagged progesterone concentrations. We conclude that progesterone release occurs in a periodic (circadian and ultradian) fashion as well as in a discrete (episodic or pulsatile) mode. Moreover, both positive and negative feedback relationships operate to coordinate LH and progesterone secretion in the midluteal phase of the human menstrual cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence indicate that multiple human fetal tissues synthesize somatomedins/insulin-like growth factors (Sm/IGFs). To investigate the synthesis of Sm/IGFs in vivo, we isolated polyadenylated RNAs from multiple human fetal tissues of 16-20 weeks gestation and performed Northern and dot-blot analyses using 32P-labeled cDNAs and oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligomer) probes complementary to human Sm-C/IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs. Sm-C/IGF-I mRNAs were present in all tissues studied. IGF-II mRNAs were detectable in all tissues except the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. IGF-II mRNA levels were consistently higher than Sm-C/IGF-I mRNAs in all tissues where IGF-II mRNAs were detectable (varying from 2-fold higher in spleen and thymus to 650-fold higher in liver), suggesting that IGF-II is synthesized in greater quantities than Sm-C/IGF-I in most tissues during early fetal life. Liver, adrenal, and skeletal muscle had the highest levels of IGF-II mRNAs, while placenta and stomach had the highest level of Sm-C/IGF-I mRNAs. Multiple Sm-C/IGF-I and IGF-II transcripts were identified with estimated sizes 0.7, 5.3, and 8.0 kilobases (kb) for Sm-C/IGF-I and 1.8, 2.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.2 kb for IGF-II. The 5.3-kb species was the most abundant Sm-C/IGF-I mRNA. The largest Sm-C/IGF-I transcript (8.0 kb) was identified in the intestine, muscle, kidney, placenta, stomach, heart, skin, pancreas, hypothalamus, and brain stem and was most abundant in the hypothalamus and muscle. The smallest transcript (0.7 kb) was detectable only in spleen, adrenal, placenta, and stomach. On the other hand, nearly all species of IGF-II mRNAs were found in tissues with detectable mRNAs, with the 6.2-kb mRNA being the most abundant. The variation in abundance and species of Sm-C/IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs among different human fetal tissues suggests tissue-specific differences in Sm-C/IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression, mRNA precursor processing, and/or mRNA stability. Such differences may have significance for the roles of Sm-C/IGF-I and IGF-II during human fetal development. The finding of Sm/IGF mRNAs in many human fetal tissues also supports a local role for Sm/IGFs in human fetal development.\r"

This report describes the development of a prolactinoma in a man with previously normal plasma PRL levels after the administration of pharmacological doses of estrogen. The patient, a 26-yr-old male to female transsexual, took cyproterone acetate (100 mg/day, orally) and ethinyl estradiol (100 micrograms/day, orally) for 10 months and (surrepititiously) estradiol-17-undecanoate (100 mg, twice weekly, im) for about 6 of the 10 months. Plasma PRL levels rose from 0.05 to 5.20 U/L within 10 months (normal, 0.05-0.30 U/L). A computed tomographic scan showed a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension. After all estrogen therapy was discontinued, his plasma estradiol levels gradually declined from 2.8 to 0.77 nmol/L (normal, 0.04-0.12 nmol/L), but PRL levels rose further to 6.2 U/L. Bromocriptine treatment (2.5 mg twice daily) then was given. Plasma PRL fell gradually to 0.43 U/L and a computed tomographic scan after 5 months showed reduction in tumor size. The patient then discontinued bromocriptine treatment. Four months later his plasma estradiol level was normal, while plasma PRL had risen to 4.6 U/L, indicating autonomous PRL secretion. We conclude that 1) estrogen in pharmacological doses can induce prolactinomas in man; and 2) subjects treated with high doses of estrogen must, therefore, be surveyed for the development of such tumors.\r"

Thirty minute exposure to 7 X 10(-10) MbPTH (1-34) equivalents of ACSA from the human and animal tumors, reduced NaPiT by 20% and 14%, respectively.

Based on the deduced amino-acid sequence, we synthesized tyr36 (1-36) hACSP. This synthetic peptide induced a 22% decrease in the initial rate of NaPiT by the epithelial monolayer. Its inhibitory activity was roughly equipotent to that of bPTH (1-34). We conclude that the ACSP derived from HHM-associated tumors decreases phosphate transport in renal epithelial cells. This peptide appears to play a key role in mediating the changes in phosphate metabolism in this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The observation that virtually all of the somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the stomach consists of somatostatin-14 (S14), to the exclusion of somatostatin-28 (S28), suggests a unique pattern of prosomatostatin posttranslational processing. In order to examine the mechanisms by which S14 is produced from its precursor in the stomach, we investigated the biosynthesis of somatostatin in isolated canine fundic D cells. D cells pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine revealed a cycloheximide inhibitable time-dependent incorporation of radioactivity into S14. A small fraction of radioactivity was incorporated into S28 but not into larger precursors. However, when the cells were incubated with monensin (1 microM), incorporation of radioactivity into a presumed somatostatin precursor was noted. Upon transfer of [35S]cysteine prelabeled cells to radioactivity-free medium, no conversion of S28 to S14 could be detected and the decrease of labeled S14 in cells correlated with a complimentary increase in the culture medium. Exogenous somatostatin inhibited somatostatin biosynthesis in a fashion that could be blocked by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Stimulation of prelabeled D cells with tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (10(-7) M) or forskolin (10(-4) M) for 2 h resulted in release of 41 and 33% of the newly synthesized radioactive S14, respectively, while only 9 and 6% of the total cell content of radioimmunoassayable somatostatin was secreted. These data suggest that: (a) somatostatin is synthesized in fundic D cells primarily as S14, (b) S14 is produced by rapid processing of a larger precursor but there is little, if any, conversion of S28 to S14, (c) somatostatin biosynthesis is autoregulated, and (d) newly synthesized S14 is preferentially released from D cells in response to stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the association of lipid with the cytoskeleton of platelets during aggregation, rabbit and human platelets were isolated and labeled with [3H]palmitic acid; lipid extraction showed approximately 80% in phospholipid. Limited aggregation was induced with ADP or thrombin, and the cytoskeleton was isolated after lysis with 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA. Cytoskeleton from unactivated platelets had approximately 0.03% of the total label in the platelets, but after aggregation with ADP (2 microM) or thrombin (0.1 U/ml) for 20-30 s, 1.5-8% of the label was with the cytoskeleton. Fibrinogen enhanced aggregation and the association of label with the cytoskeleton; incorporation of label increased exponentially as aggregation proceeded, decreased exponentially during deaggregation, and appeared to be related to the number of sites of contact. Inhibitors that increase cyclic AMP inhibited aggregation and cytoskeletal labeling, but aspirin had no effect. Some experiments were done with DNase I and Ca2+ in the Triton X-100 lysis medium to cause actin depolymerization, under conditions in which the Ca2+-dependent protease activity was inhibited. This greatly reduced the association of label with the cytoskeleton at early time points, but when aggregation had proceeded further, a large proportion of the label was not dissociated by this treatment. These findings, electron microscopy, and the enrichment of the cytoskeleton of aggregated platelets with only some of the membrane proteins that were labeled by the 125I-lactoperoxidase method, indicated that with limited aggregation, the 3H-labeled lipid was mainly associated with the cytoskeleton and not with trapped membrane fragments resulting from incomplete lysis. Since the pattern of cytoskeleton labeling ([3H]palmitate) and the selective association of some membrane proteins with the cytoskeleton/lipid complex was the same with ADP and thrombin, the reactions must be dependent on aggregation and not on events associated with the release of granule contents.\r"

In control skin fibroblasts, CS was transported to lysosome and metabolized there to galactosylceramide (GalCer) and ceramide (Cer) within 1 h. During the chase period, radioactivity was increased at plasma membrane plus Golgi as phospholipids and no accumulation of GalCer or Cer was found in lysosome. In MLD fibroblasts, 95% of 14C-CS taken up was unhydrolyzed at 24 h-chase and accumulated at not only lysosome but also plasma membrane. In GLD fibroblasts, GalCer was accumulated throughout the subcellular fractions and more accumulated mainly at plasma membrane plus Golgi with longer pulse. This translocation of lipid from lysosome seems to have considerable function, even in lipidosis, which may result in an imbalance of the sphingolipid pattern on the cell surface and these changes might be one of causes of neuronal dysfunction in sphingolipidosis.\r"

All methods used to date have been based on the noncovalent interaction of radiolabeled androgens with the receptor's ligand binding site. We report here synthesis and use of the electrophilic affinity label dihydrotestosterone 17 beta-bromoacetate. This ligand, prepared as a radioactive compound of high specific activity, rapidly and covalently binds to a protein of 58,000 daltons in cytosol from normal genital skin fibroblasts. This protein is a high affinity, saturable specific binding site for the ligand and was not detectable in cultured cells from a subject with androgen resistance or in receptor-negative nongenital fibroblasts. The efficiency of incorporation of the covalent radiolabel into the 58-kD protein is greater than 80% based on estimates of receptor content using noncovalent ligands in intact cell assays. These studies demonstrate that dihydrotestosterone 17 beta-bromoacetate is useful for high efficiency covalent labeling of the human androgen receptor in crude cytosolic extracts from cultured cells.\r"

Fascicular sural nerve morphometry in 11 patients with neuropathy complicating insulin-dependent diabetes revealed a pattern of interrelated structural changes strikingly similar to that of the diabetic rat when compared to age-matched controls. 17 older non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients with comparable duration and severity of hyperglycemia and severity of neuropathy, displayed similar nerve fiber loss, paranodal demyelination, paranodal remyelination and segmental demyelination compared to age-matched controls, but axo-glial dysjunction was replaced by Wallerian degeneration as the primary manifestation of fiber damage, and fiber loss occurred in a spatial pattern consistent with an ischemic component. The mechanistic model developed from the diabetic rat does indeed appear to apply to human diabetic neuropathy, but superimposed hormonal, metabolic, vascular, and/or age-related effects alter the morphologic expression of the neuropathy in non-insulin dependent diabetes.\r"

In this study we explored the steroid-independent effects of a high K diet on the electrical transport properties of the isolated rabbit cortical collecting tubule principal cells. The electrophysiological analysis included transepithelial and single-cell potential measurements and equivalent circuit analysis. Rabbits were adrenalectomized (ADX) and received either a control diet (300 meq K/kg diet) or a high K diet (600 meq/kg diet) for 10 d before the experiment. The mean plasma K of ADX control animals was 6.9 mM, that of ADX animals on the high K diet 8.3 mM. The transepithelial potential difference was significantly elevated in the high K group (-3.5 mV, lumen negative), compared with ADX controls (-1.4 mV). The basolateral membrane potential in high K animals was also significantly elevated (-73 mV, cell negative, compared with -63 mV in controls). Estimates of the apical membrane partial Na and K conductances (GaNa and GaK) and of ion currents (IaNa and IaK) also demonstrated stimulation by the high K diet. In the high K group, both GaNa and GaK (0.56 and 2.67 mS.cm-2) were higher than control values (0.27 and 1.17 mS.cm-2). IaNa and IaK were also higher in high K animals (47.8 and -26.2 microA.cm-2) compared with control animals (22.4 and -11.6 microA.cm-2). Thus, a high K intake per se can induce electrophysiological changes consistent with stimulation of Na reabsorption and K secretion.\r"

The patient's cultured fibroblasts and erythrocytes had normal MAT activity. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was slightly decreased. This clinically normal individual lives with a 20-30-fold elevation of plasma methionine (0.72 mM). He excretes in his urine methionine and L-methionine-d-sulfoxide (2.7 mmol/d), a mixed disulfide of methanethiol and a thiol bound to an unidentified group X, which we abbreviate CH3S-SX (2.1 mmol/d), and smaller quantities of 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and 3-methylthiopropionate. His breath contains 17-fold normal concentrations of dimethylsulfide. He converts only 6-7 mmol/d of methionine sulfur to inorganic sulfate. This abnormally low rate is due not to a decreased flux through the primarily defective enzyme, MAT, since SAM is produced at an essentially normal rate of 18 mmol/d, but rather to a rate of homocysteine methylation which is abnormally high in the face of the very elevated methionine concentrations demonstrated in this patient. These findings support the view that SAM (which is marginally low in this patient) is an important regulator that helps to determine the partitioning of homocysteine between degradation via cystathionine and conservation by reformation of methionine. In addition, these studies demonstrate that the methionine transamination pathway operates in the presence of an elevated body load of that amino acid in human beings, but is not sufficient to maintain methionine levels in a normal range.\r"

The MNB-T2 (low malignancy) cell line was originally derived from the in situ tumor and carried in tissue culture for more than 100 passages; the MNB-T1 (high malignancy) line consisted of a new sub-culture that was also established from the in situ MNB tumor. DPD activity was determined in cytosolic preparations of MNB utilizing high performance liquid chromatography to separate the radiolabeled substrate ([2-14C]thymine) from [2-14C]dihydrothymine. The apparent affinity of DPD for NADPH in MNB cells (Km approximately 0.08 mM) was identical to that of A/J mouse brain and liver. The DPD activity of the high malignancy (MNB-T1) cell line was 14.3% of that observed in the low malignancy (MNB-T2) line. In situ tumors formed after implantation of high malignancy (MNB-T1) cells into A/J mice had only 25.2% of the DPD activity observed in tumors derived from low malignancy (MNB-T2) cells. When MNB-T2 cells were injected into naive A/J mice, tumors developed in only 68% of animals, the tumor growth rate was slow and a mortality of 20% was observed. In contrast, tumors derived from injected MNB-T1 cells showed a faster growth rate and 100% mortality. Most MNB-T2 derived tumors were not lethal and ultimately resolved while the MNB-T1 derived tumors were invariably lethal. These studies support the concept that the levels of DPD activity in neoplastic cells are inversely related to their malignant expression and also provide a model to study differences between neuroblastoma cell lines derived from the same in situ tumor but which manifest different neoplastic behavior.\r"

The basis for sensitivity and resistance to the antitumor effects of this agent remains unclear. The present studies have monitored the effects of TNF on 14 epithelial tumor cell lines. Eleven of these cell lines were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TNF (50% inhibitory concentration greater than 1,000 U/ml). 12 of the 14 tumor cell lines has detectable levels of high affinity cell surface TNF binding sites, thus suggesting that resistance was not often due to the absence of cell surface TNF receptors. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that three of the eleven resistant cell lines expressed detectable levels of TNF mRNA. Furthermore, both sensitive and resistant epithelial tumor cells had the capacity to express TNF transcripts in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Finally, the presence of TNF expression at the RNA level is shown to be associated with the production of a TNF-like protein in the resistant Ov-D ovarian carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that certain human epithelial tumor cell lines inherently resistant to TNF also express this cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "The hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mouse, a murine homologue of human X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, is characterized by renal defects in brush border membrane phosphate transport and vitamin D3 metabolism. The present study was undertaken to examine whether elevated renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity in Hyp mice is associated with increased degradation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] by side chain oxidation. Metabolites of 1,25(OH)2D3 were separated by HPLC on Zorbax SIL and identified by comparison with standards authenticated by mass spectrometry. Production of 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3, 24-oxo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 24-oxo-1,23,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 was twofold greater in mitochondria from mutant Hyp/Y mice than from normal +/Y littermates. Enzyme activities, estimated by the sum of the three products synthesized per milligram mitochondrial protein under initial rate conditions, were used to estimate kinetic parameters. The apparent Vmax was significantly greater for mitochondria from Hyp/Y mice than from +/Y mice (0.607 +/- 0.064 vs. 0.290 +/- 0.011 pmol/mg per protein per min, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.001), whereas the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was similar in both genotypes (23 +/- 2 vs. 17 +/- 5 nM). The Km for 1,25(OH)2D3 was approximately 10-fold lower than that for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], indicating that 1,25(OH)2D3 is perhaps the preferred substrate under physiological conditions. In both genotypes, apparent Vmax for 25(OH)D3 was fourfold greater than that for 1,25(OH)2D3, suggesting that side chain oxidation of 25(OH)D3 may operate at pharmacological concentrations of substrate. The present results demonstrate that Hyp mice exhibit increased renal catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 and suggest that elevated degradation of vitamin D3 hormone may contribute significantly to the clinical phenotype in this disorder.\r"

Values ranged from 11 to 476 mumol/liter in the cobalamin-deficient patients and 77 of the 78 patients had values above the normal range of 7-22 mumol/liter as determined for 50 normal blood donors. In the cobalamin-deficient patients, serum total homocysteine was positively correlated with serum folate, mean corpuscular volume, serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum methylmalonic acid, and the degree of neurologic involvement, and inversely correlated with platelets and hematocrit. In the folate-deficient patients, values for serum total homocysteine ranged from 17 to 185 mumol/liter and 18 of the 19 patients had values above the normal range. Some patients with pernicious anemia who were intermittently treated with cyanocobalamin were found to have elevated serum levels of total homocysteine while they were free of hematologic and neurologic abnormalities. The measurement of serum total homocysteine will help define the incidence of cobalamin deficiency and folate deficiency in various patient populations.\r"

In the present study using IM-9 cultured human lymphocytes, we investigated the mechanism responsible for this glucocorticoid mediated increase in insulin receptor mRNA levels. Incubation of IM-9 cells with 100 nM dexamethasone for 4 h stimulated a parallel increase in both polysomal and nuclear insulin receptor RNAs indicating that glucocorticoids did not alter the nuclear transport of insulin receptor RNA. Dexamethasone did not alter insulin receptor mRNA half life (t 1/2 = 140 +/- 20 min), indicating that glucocorticoids did not influence mRNA stability. Furthermore, the dexamethasone-induced increase in insulin receptor mRNA levels was not blocked by pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide indicating that the glucocorticoid effect was independent of new protein synthesis. When the labeled transcripts from nuclear run-off incubations were then hybridized to immobilize human insulin receptor cDNA, a three- to fourfold increase in transcriptional activity was observed. This transcriptional effect occurred before the increase in steady state insulin receptor mRNA levels and over the same range of dexamethasone concentrations. These studies indicate therefore a direct effect of glucocorticoids on insulin receptor gene transcription, and demonstrate that the insulin receptor gene is under hormonal control.\r"

The synthetic hACSP is a potent agonist of renal membrane adenylate cyclase (Km, 1.7 X 10(-10)) and of bone cell adenylate cyclase (Km 1 X 10(-9)M). It is a potent bone-resorbing agent in vitro, stimulating 45Ca release from fetal rat long bones at a concentration of 10(-9) M. When infused via osmotic minipumps into rats, it is also a potent calcemic factor in vivo, inducing a rise in serum calcium from (mean +/- SD) 10.6 +/- 0.6 to 19.7 +/- 3.2 mg/dl when infused at 1.4 micrograms/h and from 9.9 +/- 0.7 to 11.4 +/- 1.2 mg/dl when infused at 0.14 micrograms/h. These findings indicate that biologically active hACSP fragments can be synthesized. One such synthetic peptide possesses the in vitro and in vivo bioactivities demonstrated in native, tumor-derived hACSPs. It is also a potent calcemic, bone-resorbing agent.\r"

Incubation of confluent RAEC monolayers with 2 ng.ml-1 of bacterial LPS for 3 h did not change the protein content or the number of cells on the filters, but resulted in a marked decline in TEER (from 14.1 +/- 0.9 to 5.1 +/- 0.6 omega.cm2) and a significant increase in LDL transport across the monolayers (from 154 +/- 13 to 456 +/- 41 ng. h-1 per cm2). In contrast, exposure of RAEC monolayers for 3 d to as much as 5 micrograms.ml-1 of LPS complexed to LDL (LPS-LDL) did not alter the TEER or LDL transport. LPS-LDL was transported across the monolayers at the same rate as LDL. While microgram quantities of LPS complexed to LDL did not disrupt the integrity of the endothelial monolayer, incubation of RAECs with transported LPS-LDL at concentrations of 25-100 ng LPS.ml-1 resulted in a two- to ninefold increase in the secretion of monocyte chemotactic activity by these cells. Incubation of rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells with transported LPS-LDL at concentrations of 25-100 ng LPS.ml-1 resulted in a two- to threefold increase in the secretion of monocyte chemotactic activity. We propose that LDL protects endothelial cells from the acute toxicity of LPS but the resulting complexes are transported across the endothelium in a biologically active form that can initiate an inflammatory response.\r"

This system was used to determine the nature of the biochemical defect in seven patients with the autosomal recessive, cytochrome b-positive form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). A severe deficiency in the cytosol factor was identified in each patient. The defective activity was not caused by the presence of an inhibitor, nor could it be restored to normal by combining cytosol fractions from different patients. In contrast, the membrane fractions from all seven patients contained normal levels of NADPH oxidase when activated in the presence of control cytosol. Of family members tested (obligate heterozygotes for this disorder), seven of eight had intermediate levels of cytosol factor activity. The respiratory burst defect in this form of CGD is caused by an abnormality in the cytosolic factor required for NADPH oxidase activation.\r"

Control experiments conducted in parallel included kidneys of nonanemic mice, RNase-treated hypoxic kidney sections, and 35S-labeled non-Epo-related DNA. The Epo probe gave a specific hybridization signal in the hypoxic kidney in the cortex and to a lesser extent in the outer medulla. Glomerular and tubular cells were not labeled. All positive cells were identified as peritubular cells. Using immunofluorescence, we showed that cells with the same topography contained Factor VIII-related antigen.

Ischemia was produced by occluding the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) for 90 min and then reperfusing for 6 h. There was no difference between control and antibody treated groups with respect to arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or LCX blood flow. Administration of antibody produced no observable effect on circulating neutrophil counts, suggesting that antibody-bound neutrophils were not cleared from the circulation. The mean size of myocardial infarct expressed as percentage of the area at risk of infarction that resulted was reduced by 46% with anti-Mo1 treatment (25.8 +/- 4.7%, n = 8) compared to control (47.6 +/- 5.7%, n = 8; P less than 0.01). The area at risk of infarction was similar between groups. Circulating (serum) antibody excess was confirmed in all 8 anti-Mo1 treated dogs by immunofluorescence analysis. Analysis of ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram as an indicator of the severity of ischemia suggests that the anti-Mo1 reduces infarct size independent of the severity of ischemia. An additional group of dogs (n = 5) was tested with a control monoclonal antibody of the same subtype (murine IgG1) and was found to produce no significant reduction in myocardial infarct size. Accumulation of neutrophils within the myocardium was significantly attenuated with 904 treatment when analyzed by histological methods. These data demonstrate that administration of anti-Mo1 monoclonal antibody after the induction of regional myocardial ischemia results in reduced myocardial reperfusion injury as measured by ultimate infarct size.\r"

To study the molecular basis of the mutations causing GA, we cloned and sequenced the human OAT cDNA and determined the intron-exon arrangement of the structural gene. Using the cDNA template, we synthesized antisense RNA probes and performed RNase A protection experiments with RNA from four Lebanese GA patients. We found a probe-target mismatch at the 5' end of the first coding exon and amplified this region of the patients' genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis showed a G----A transition, changing the initiator ATG (methionine) codon to ATA. This mutation segregates with the GA allele in both pedigrees. Initiation of translation at the closest in-frame methionine codon would truncate OAT by 138 amino acids, eliminating the entire mitochondrial leader sequence and 113 amino acids of the mature peptide.\r"

One of the best coping mechanisms is to develop a social support system. Despite many concerns about sexual activities, the patient's work performance often goes on as before. By 1985, law suits by patients against those who allegedly gave them herpes had not resulted in awards at the Appeals Court level and one malpractice suit against physicians was not awarded. Genital infections in children must be regarded as potential child abuse by physicians. Morally, it is right for an infected person to disclose the existence of herpes to a potential partner but this is not always done for fear of compromising a relationship in its early phases. Because one's original infection may be asymptomatic, relating the time of acquisition of an infection to an act of infidelity cannot be judged solely on the basis of the time of the herpetic breakout.\r"

Intravenous acyclovir in immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster decreases new lesion formation, decreases acute pain, halts dissemination of the virus, and lessens visceral complications. Intravenous acyclovir may also be effective in zoster encephalitis. Intravenous vidarabine also has a favorable affect on chickenpox and herpes zoster. Topical acyclovir may benefit herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients by accelerating cutaneous healing. Oral acyclovir appears to be effective in varicella and zoster in immunocompromised patients. It is also effective in otherwise normal patients, but its effect seems less dramatic and the drug must be given early. Neither acyclovir nor vidarabine has been proven clearly to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Because varicella zoster virus is less sensitive to acyclovir than is herpes simplex, intravenous doses of 500 mg/m2 or 10 mg/kg every 8 hours or oral doses of 800 mg five times a day are recommended. At these doses adequate hydration and urine flow must be maintained, the mental status of the patient must be monitored, and impaired renal function requires regulation of dosage downward.\r"

Patients usually have altered levels of consciousness, altered levels of mentation, fever, headache, and personality changes. These may progress to hemiparesis and seizures. Exact diagnosis must be established by brain biopsy and identification of the virus in biopsy material. There is a great need for a noninvasive test that is positive early in the disease. Without antiviral treatment the mortality rate is greater than 70%, and many survivors have serious disabilities. Both adenine arabinoside and acyclovir decrease death and morbidity, but acyclovir is the preferred drug. With acyclovir about 40% of patients will survive with normal development or minor levels of impairment but more than half of the patients will die or suffer significant impairment. It is essential to treat early; patients who are young and have not reached coma or impaired consciousness may show 65% recovery and return to normal function. Development of new antiviral drugs or other types of therapies is desirable. Herpetic skin lesions are likely to be more confusing than diagnostic because other types of encephalitis with fever often precipitate recurrent herpes that is unrelated to the encephalitis.\r"

Using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid techniques, a vaccine for bovine papillomavirus has been prepared. This is in clinical trials and probably will be licensed for use in cattle in 1988.

The live, attenuated varicella vaccine protects immunocompromised and normal persons against clinical chickenpox but it does not completely prevent subsequent infection with natural chickenpox virus or latency. With herpes simplex vaccines we may have to be satisfied with amelioration or control of clinical infections and diminution of latency and recurrent disease. Varicella zoster immune globulin plays a useful role in attenuation of varicella in immunocompromised or special-risk persons exposed to varicella zoster virus. Passive immunization for herpes simplex (herpes simplex immune globulin or other antibody preparations) has been studied very little. Maybe passive immunization will have a place in future therapies, especially for serious herpes simplex virus infections in immunocompromised hosts.\r"

To determine the predictors of cardiac death after acute coronary closure, 50 clinical, angiographic and procedural variables were analyzed by an observer unaware of the clinical outcome for each of the 13 patients who died and also 100 patients randomly chosen, in whom vessel closure after angioplasty did not result in death during hospitalization. Univariate analysis found female gender (p less than 0.0001), collateral channels from the vessel dilated (p less than 0.0001), use of balloon counterpulsation (p less than 0.0002), pre- and postprocedural hypotension (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.003, respectively), jeopardy score greater than or equal to 2.5 (p = 0.003), left ventricular hypertrophy (p = 0.013), hypertension (p = 0.02), diabetes (p = 0.02) and multivessel disease (p = 0.03) to be predictive of death. Multivariate analysis found collateral vessels, female gender and multivessel disease to be independent predictors of death. Thus, cardiac death after elective coronary angioplasty is very rare in experienced centers and occurs most often in women with a large amount of potentially ischemic myocardium. Hypotension often precedes the fatal closure event. Close attention to the amount of potentially ischemic myocardium and to the fluid volume status of these patients would seem to be especially warranted.\r"

The postangioplasty exercise test showed ischemia in 13% of patients with single vessel and 29% of those with multivessel disease, although only 7 and 13%, respectively, experienced angina. The mean exercise duration was comparable for patients with multivessel disease (453 +/- 174 s) and single vessel disease (476 +/- 166 s). To assess the impact of the degree of revascularization in patients with multivessel disease on the results of exercise testing, 48 patients with completely revascularized vessels and 97 with incompletely revascularized vessels were evaluated. The mean exercise duration (459 +/- 178 versus 450 +/- 173 s), mean maximal heart rate (132 +/- 31 versus 136 +/- 25 beats/min) and mean systolic blood pressure (174 +/- 25 versus 170 +/- 26 mm Hg) were similar in completely and incompletely revascularized groups.

Thus, exercise stress testing provides evidence that successful angioplasty can relieve electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia as well as anginal symptoms in the majority of patients with either single or multivessel coronary artery disease who are suitable candidates for the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The long-term outcome and the significance of residual ischemic myocardium, as assessed by predischarge exercise thallium scintigraphy and vessel patency, were studied in 97 patients with single vessel coronary artery disease by angiography 12 +/- 4 days after uncomplicated myocardial infarction. During a mean follow-up period of 39 +/- 17 months, no patients died, 6 (6%) had a recurrent nonfatal infarction and 25 (26%) experienced rapidly progressive angina requiring hospitalization. Although neither exercise-induced angina nor ST segment depression was predictive of a recurrent cardiac event, the mean number of infarct zone scan segments showing thallium redistribution (1.0 +/- 1.0 versus 0.5 +/- 0.8, p = 0.01) and the percent of patients with infarct zone redistribution (61 versus 39%, p = 0.05) were greater in those patients who experienced a late ischemic event. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a lower event-free survival rate in patients with redistribution (n = 45) than in those without redistribution (n = 52) (p = 0.019). Although no patient received immediate thrombolytic therapy, the infarct-related vessel was angiographically patent in 40 patients (41%). Vessel patency did not influence event-free survival, although a patent vessel, as compared with an occluded vessel, was associated with a greater prevalence of non-Q wave infarction (58 versus 21%, p less than 0.001), fewer persistent infarct zone thallium defects (1.2 +/- 1.1 versus 2.0 +/- 1.2, p = 0.001), more reversible infarct zone thallium defects (1.0 +/- 1.0 versus 0.5 +/- 0.9, p = 0.02) and a trend toward a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (53 +/- 10% versus 49 +/- 12%, p = 0.07). In summary, uncomplicated myocardial infarction in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease is associated with a very low incidence of subsequent death and reinfarction. The presence of infarct zone thallium redistribution, compared with its absence, is predictive of a higher cardiac event rate. These data should be considered when recommending prophylactic percutaneous transluminal angioplasty after uncomplicated myocardial infarction in asymptomatic patients with single vessel coronary disease. On the basis of these results, future randomized trials designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of revascularization in asymptomatic postinfarction patients with single vessel disease should limit enrollment to those patients with residual ischemia located within the infarct zone.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data suggest that patients who manifest extension of their acute myocardial infarct have a worse prognosis than to those who do not have this complication and, if identified early, may be candidates for more aggressive intervention. Serial two-dimensional echocardiography was used to diagnose myocardial infarct extension in 33 consecutive patients and its sensitivity was compared with that of electrocardiography (ECG) and serum creatine kinase determination. Infarct extension was diagnosed clinically using ECG and enzymatic criteria. The echocardiograms were scored using a weighted regional scoring system, with each segment of the left ventricle ascribed a percent of the total left ventricular mass. Abnormal regions were summed to yield a percent asynergy. In the postinfarction period, 19 episodes of acute ischemia occurred; in 9 of these episodes clinical extension was confirmed, and in 7 of the 9 episodes echocardiographic extension was detected. In the patients in whom infarct extension was documented clinically, the mean asynergy score increased from a mean of 19.2 +/- 11.3% to 36.1 +/- 18.2% (p less than 0.01). Where no extension was detected, the asynergy score improved from the initial 31.5 +/- 24.1% to 28.3 +/- 21.9% (p less than 0.05). The extent of the change in echocardiographic wall motion abnormality was not predicted by the amount of creatine kinase reelevation. Electrocardiography alone failed to distinguish which episodes of ischemia represented infarct extension and which did not. Greater degrees of asynergy were associated with worse in-hospital mortality. Two-dimensional echocardiography is a useful method for detecting myocardial infarct extension providing a means of assessing functional impact and prognosis.\r"

There were 13 women and 1 man with a mean age of 55 +/- 4 years (range 23 to 73). Mitral balloon valvuloplasty resulted in an increase in mitral valve area from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p = 0.001), a decrease in mean mitral diastolic pressure gradient from 15 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p = 0.001) and an increase in cardiac output from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 3.9 +/- 0.3 liters/min (p = 0.03). No deaths, strokes, vascular complications or conduction abnormalities were observed. Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in severity in seven patients (50%). There was no evidence of significant left to right shunt through the atrial septal puncture site after mitral balloon valvuloplasty. A good result (defined as a mitral valve area greater than 1.0 cm2, an increase in mitral valve area greater than 25% and a mean gradient less than 10 mm Hg) was achieved in 9 (64%) of the 14 patients. A subgroup of four patients who had a superior result (increase in mitral valve area of 1.7 +/- 0.2 versus 0.5 +/- 0.1 cm2 in the other 10 patients, p = 0.004) was identified. These patients had less echocardiographic evidence of rheumatic mitral valve damage and were the only patients who had sinus rhythm. They were also younger, less debilitated and had a lower grade of fluoroscopic valve calcification compared with the other patients. Thus, mitral balloon valvuloplasty is a safe and effective procedure for patients with recurrent mitral stenosis after surgical commissurotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty is a new technique used in the treatment of adult patients with mitral stenosis. To evaluate the occurrence and severity of mitral regurgitation after balloon valvuloplasty, 24 patients (20 women and 4 men, mean age 57 years) were studied using two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography before and less than 24 h after this procedure. Mitral valve area increased after valvuloplasty in all patients, from 0.89 +/- 0.07 to 1.61 +/- 0.09 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Before valvuloplasty, 10 patients had no mitral regurgitation, 4 had 1+, 4 had 2+ and 6 had 3+ mitral regurgitation. After valvuloplasty, new mitral regurgitation occurred in six patients. Regurgitation grade did not change in 13 patients (54%), increased by one grade in 8 patients (33%) and by two grades in 3 patients (13%). Left atrial volume decreased in all except one patient from 100 +/- 12 to 83 +/- 12 cm3 (p less than 0.001). Neither age, sex, cardiac rhythm, initial mitral valve area, increase in mitral valve area, morphologic characteristics of the valvular and subvalvular apparatus, previous mitral commissurotomy nor effective balloon dilating area discriminated between those patients with and without an increase in mitral regurgitation after valvuloplasty. Thus, mitral balloon valvuloplasty is frequently associated with an increase in mitral regurgitation. However, in this series, no patient developed severe mitral regurgitation, and left atrial volume decreased in nearly all patients. An increase in mitral regurgitation could not be predicted from any features of the valve or subvalvular apparatus, clinical characteristics of the patients or technical aspects of the procedure.\r"

Four patients who had electrocardiographic evidence of type II AV block and confirmation of block in the His-Purkinje system during electrophysiologic study were evaluated. These patients received intravenous atropine (1.0 to 2.4 mg), propranolol (0.15 mg/kg body weight) or isoproterenol (1 and 2 micrograms/min) alone or in combination. In two of three patients receiving propranolol, the atrial pacing cycle length at which 1:1 His-Purkinje conduction occurred was prolonged relative to control (from 360 to 470 ms and 440 to 590 ms, respectively). In contrast, atropine in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade shortened the cycle length at which 1:1 His-Purkinje conduction occurred in three of four patients receiving the drug (470 to 390, 630 to 570 and 590 to 560 ms, respectively). Isoproterenol also improved His-Purkinje conduction in the one patient receiving this drug. No agent affected the duration of the HV interval during spontaneous sinus rhythm or right atrial pacing. Thus, drugs that alter autonomic tone influence abnormal His-Purkinje conduction minimally during sinus rhythm but, importantly, may modulate the atrial pacing cycle length at which type II AV block occurs.\r"

Both methods were assessed in 55 subjects comprising 26 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I), 18 control patients with organic heart disease but without sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group II) and 11 normal volunteers (Group III). Time domain analysis was performed with high pass filtering of 25, 40 and 80 Hz and low pass filtering of 250 Hz. Frequency domain analysis was performed on the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex, either alone or with 216 or 150 ms of the ST segment. Absolute summed energies of discrete frequency bands and band energy ratios were calculated. The effectiveness of discrimination between Groups I and II was evaluated in terms of group means, sensitivity, specificity and an information content index based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Group I showed a uniform decrease in amplitude across all frequencies derived from the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex (p less than 0.005). This was abolished by the inclusion of ST segment data in frequency domain analysis. No frequency band was unique for Group I. At a specificity of 78%, the best time domain sensitivity was 85%, and the best frequency domain sensitivity was 77%. The best time domain information content index was 0.156, the best index for frequency domain analysis was 0.077 using absolute band areas. It is concluded that patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia have decreased energy content across all frequencies in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex. Frequency domain analysis was not an improvement over time domain analysis in differentiating patients with ventricular tachycardia from those without.\r"

Comparisons of long-term morphologic changes in internal mammary artery grafts and saphenous vein grafts and correlation with premortem angiography have not been reported. Eighteen internal mammary artery and 15 saphenous vein grafts that had been in place for 12 to 118 months (mean 56) in 18 patients were removed either surgically or at necropsy and examined histologically. Premortem angiograms were performed within 1 month of histologic study in 15 of these patients. Fibrointimal proliferation was more frequent in internal mammary artery than in saphenous vein grafts 8 [( 44%] of 18 versus 4 [27%] of 15; p = NS). In contrast, atherosclerosis was common in saphenous vein grafts but was extremely rare in internal mammary artery grafts (10 of 15 versus 1 of 18; p = 0.01). A good correlation was noted between the degree of narrowing estimated by angiographic and histologic measurements in both internal mammary artery grafts (d = 0.90) and saphenous vein grafts (d = 0.71). Accelerated atherosclerosis did not occur in internal mammary artery grafts, but was common in saphenous vein grafts. Fibrointimal proliferation was commonly associated with graft narrowing in internal mammary artery grafts and may be an important factor in late graft closure. This study also confirms that internal mammary artery grafts have greater longevity compared with saphenous vein grafts.\r"

Twenty-three patients with either mitral or aortic regurgitation underwent simultaneous continuous wave Doppler and dual catheter pressure recordings to determine if instantaneous pressure gradients can be accurately determined by Doppler ultrasound in left-sided regurgitant valve lesions. Using the modified Bernoulli equation, the maximal and mean pressure gradients between the left ventricle and left atrium were determined by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound in patients with mitral regurgitation and compared with simultaneous catheter-derived pressures. The mean and end-diastolic pressure gradients between the aorta and left ventricle were determined by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound in patients with aortic regurgitation and compared with simultaneous catheter-derived pressures. Diastolic half-times by both continuous wave Doppler ultrasound and catheter pressures were compared in patients with aortic regurgitation. There was a linear correlation between the mean gradients in all patients (r = 0.94; SEE = 6 mm Hg) with a similar correlation between the instantaneous gradients (r = 0.98; SEE = 8 mm Hg). There was a linear correlation between diastolic half-times by catheter and Doppler ultrasound (r = 0.95; SEE = 39 ms).

To determine the basis for this relation, phonocardiograms and high fidelity right atrial and ventricular pressures were recorded in 29 patients with a right ventricular systolic pressure ranging from 20 to 149 mm Hg. In 22 patients with normal right atrial pressure (less than or equal to 8 mm Hg), both the time interval and the magnitude of pressure decrease from pulmonary valve closure to tricuspid valve opening were linearly related to systolic pressure (r = 0.89 and 0.96, respectively). Early pulmonary valve closure (decreased \"hang-out\" time) contributed to the greater magnitude of isovolumic pressure decrease at high systolic pressures, but correction for hang-out time did not eliminate the relation between systolic pressure and the pulmonary valve closure-tricuspid valve opening interval (n = 10). When patients with documented right coronary artery disease were excluded, the time constant for isovolumic pressure decrease also increased as a function of systolic pressure (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01, n = 24), suggesting impaired relaxation at high systolic pressures. However, the mean rate of pressure decrease (mean negative dP/dt) still was greater in patients with a high pressure because of the exponential nature of the isovolumic pressure-time relation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 16 patients without heart disease, the correlation (r) between systemic (Qs) and pulmonary (Qp) blood flow was 0.96 (SEE = 0.417 liter/min, y = 1.05x - 0.21) and the mean Qp/Qs ratio was 1.01 +/- 0.09. In 16 patients with an atrial septal defect, the Qp/Qs ration measured by oximetry ranged from 1.34 to 4.61 and by pulsed Doppler echocardiography from 1.31 to 4.46 (p = NS). In these 16 patients, the correlation between the Qp/Qs ratio determined by oximetry and pulsed Doppler echocardiography was significant (r = 0.82, SEE = 0.54). In the total group of 32 patients, the correlation was stronger (r = 0.93, SEE = 0.37). Systematic differences between the invasive and noninvasive shunt calculations did not occur. Thus, in adult patients with an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and high quality echocardiograms, the magnitude of left to right shunt can be accurately assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. In the absence of pulmonary hypertension, pulsed Doppler echocardiography provides precise information for the decision to undertake conservative or operative treatment.\r"

This was accounted for in a new method of measuring stroke volume and cardiac output in the mitral orifice by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. This method was compared with simultaneous thermodilution in 30 adult patients in sinus rhythm without substantial atrioventricular or pulmonary valve abnormalities. The mitral orifice was assimilated to a conduit with 1) an ellipse-shaped inlet and outlet, 2) the same (and constant) long axis for the inlet and outlet ellipses (that is, the mediolateral anulus diameter measured on apical four chamber views), and 3) a varying outlet short axis (that is, the mitral anteroposterior leaflet separation derived from left parasternal M-mode recordings). This method design avoided the need for a short-axis view of the whole circumference of the mitral outlet orifice, which is difficult to obtain in many adult patients. The mitral flow velocity was recorded from the apex under two-dimensional guidance, within the mitral canal, close to the outlet section. Integration of instantaneous mitral leaflet separation multiplied by instantaneous flow velocity was performed using Simpson's rule. In addition to the proposed \"instantaneous orifice area\" method (method A), a \"mean orifice area\" method (method B) was also compared with thermodilution. In this simplified method, mitral flow was the product of mean orifice area and the diastolic mitral velocity integral, both derived from the same recordings as for method A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right ventricular hypertrophy is found at autopsy in patients who die suddenly but, until recently, systematic evaluation of right ventricular morphology has not been feasible. In this two-dimensional echocardiographic study, a total of 4 to 10 (median 7) right ventricular wall thickness measurements were made from six right ventricular views in 73 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Forty-one normal subjects were also studied for comparison. Thirty-two (44%) of the 73 patients had right ventricular hypertrophy with at least two of the wall thickness measurements exceeding 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean value in the normal subjects. Right ventricular hypertrophy was mild (less than or equal to 8 mm) in 24 patients, moderate (9 to 12 mm) in 7 and severe (greater than 12 mm) in 1. The coefficient of variation of right ventricular wall thickness measurements was similar in normal subjects and patients with and without right ventricular hypertrophy (17 +/- 7, 11 +/- 8 and 10 +/- 8, respectively). The hypertrophy was concentric, with a coefficient of variation of 25% in all but one patient.

  ".W": "Rapid atrial pacing is a useful technique and often the therapy of choice to terminate atrial flutter in patients. However, interruption of atrial flutter by rapid atrial pacing may not always produce sinus rhythm, but rather may result in atrial fibrillation. Twelve patients with spontaneous atrial flutter that had been present for greater than 24 h were studied to assess the efficacy of atrial pacing, alone and in combination with procainamide, to convert atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Rapid atrial pacing for greater than or equal to 15 s from selected atrial sites at selected pacing rates were performed during atrial flutter. The initial pacing rate was always at a cycle length 10 ms shorter than the atrial flutter cycle length. If atrial flutter persisted after cessation of pacing, it was repeated at progressively shorter cycle lengths until either a rate of 400 beats/min was achieved or atrial fibrillation was induced. In two patients, atrial flutter was converted to sinus rhythm with pacing alone. Three patients developed sustained atrial fibrillation as a result of the rapid atrial pacing, this rhythm ultimately reverting back to atrial flutter in two. Ten patients received procainamide and 9 of the 10 had lengthening of the atrial flutter cycle length by a mean of 68 ms (1 patient continued to have atrial fibrillation). Then, using the same atrial pacing protocol, high right atrial pacing alone at a mean cycle length of 227 ms interrupted atrial flutter in all these patients, returning their rhythm to sinus rhythm. It is concluded that intravenous procainamide effectively augments the efficacy of rapid atrial pacing to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm.\r"

Fifteen patients undergoing defibrillator implantation were studied to compare the efficacy of the catheter with that of the superior vena cava spring (6.7 cm2, anode)-left ventricular patch (13.5 cm2, cathode) electrode system using truncated exponential waveforms with 60% tilt. The catheter is 11F in diameter and tripolar. A distal platinum-iridium tip used for pacing was separated by 4 mm from a middle 4.3 cm2 platinum electrode; these were positioned at the right ventricular apex. The proximal 8.5 cm2 platinum electrode was situated at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction. Defibrillation was performed using the middle (cathode) and proximal (anode) electrodes. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by alternating current six times, and defibrillation shocks of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 J were given in random order, first using the catheter and then the spring-patch system. Rescue shocks of higher energy were given if there was failure. Although very low energy levels appeared to be slightly more efficacious when using the spring-patch system, there was no statistically significant difference between the electrode systems for any of the energies tested. Permanent implantation of the catheter would have been suitable in 45% of the patients, as compared with 54% of patients with the spring-patch system (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preoperative echocardiographic examinations as well as operative reports of all patients (33 patients aged 2 months to 23 years at surgery) with ostium primum atrial septal defect or transitional atrioventricular (AV) canal defect having had echocardiography and surgical repair at The Children's Hospital, Boston from July 1983 to January 1986 were retrospectively reviewed. Original cardiac catheterization and angiographic reports also were reviewed. Preoperative echocardiography resulted in no false positive or false negative primary diagnoses when compared with the diagnoses obtained at preoperative angiography or surgery. Doppler assessment of mitral regurgitation correlated well with angiographic (93% agreement) and intraoperative (85% agreement) assessments of mitral regurgitation to within two diagnostic categories on the six level scoring system used. There was reasonably good agreement between the two-dimensional echocardiographic estimate of right ventricular systolic pressure and that measured at catheterization when expressed as percent of the simultaneous left ventricular pressure. Seven of nine ventricular septal defects observed intraoperatively were noted on preoperative echocardiography; five of these defects were detected on preoperative angiography. A variety of other surgically confirmed associated cardiovascular defects were observed by both preoperative techniques. However, echocardiography appeared to be superior to angiography for evaluation of AV valve morphology and papillary muscle architecture. This study implies that in children with typical clinical and two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler findings for ostium primum atrial septal defect or transitional AV canal defect, routine preoperative cardiac catheterization and angiography are unnecessary.\r"

This report describes 10 infants and children (median age 6 months; range birth to 7.5 years) with automatic atrial tachycardia and their management and follow-up. Digoxin alone was unsuccessful in controlling tachycardia in all 10 patients but decreased the tachycardia rate by 5 to 20% in 8. Intravenous (0.1 mg/kg body weight per dose) and oral propranolol successfully suppressed tachycardia in three of five patients and oral propranolol successfully controlled tachycardia in two of five other patients. Class I antiarrhythmic agents--quinidine (three patients), procainamide (four patients) and phenytoin (three patients)--did not control tachycardia in any patients but made the tachycardia rate worse in three patients. Intravenous (5 mg/kg per dose) and oral amiodarone suppressed tachycardia in three of four patients and oral amiodarone suppressed it in another patient. Thus, intravenous propranolol and amiodarone were effective in acutely suppressing automatic ectopic atrial tachycardia and predicted the response to long-term oral therapy. One patient had persistent tachycardia after surgical ablation of the high right atrial ectopic focus, and another patient had unsuccessful catheter ablation of the high right atrial ectopic focus (25 J). During follow-up (10 to 28 months), ectopic atrial tachycardia resolved completely in four patients and was well controlled in four patients.\r"

This report describes the echocardiographic and anatomic features in 4 patients with a restrictive ventricular septal defect among 269 patients with tetralogy of Fallot undergoing surgical repair. Echocardiography determined the presence and identity of the obstructing tissue in all four patients. In one patient, the defect was small in association with marked septal hypertrophy. In three patients, accessory or excessive tricuspid valve tissue obstructed the defect in a manner similar to spontaneous closure of isolated membranous ventricular septal defects. Autopsy and catheterization findings are also presented of an additional case with a unique mechanism of obstruction by a tricuspid valve with Ebstein's anomaly. In patients with tetralogy of Fallot, recognition of an obstructed ventricular septal defect is important because it appears to have a poor prognosis.\r"

Prospective identification of this condition was achieved by two-dimensional echocardiography alone in two patients. Using a parasagittal plane from the second or third intercostal space, identification of the anomalous origin from the pulmonary artery was also possible in the other children on subsequent examination. In all of these studies the right coronary artery was considerably enlarged. The ratio of the diameters of the right coronary artery and the aortic root was 0.25 to 0.33 (normal 0.12 +/- 0.02). Flow mapping by color Doppler ultrasound in three children studied most recently and peripheral arterial or aortic root contrast echocardiography identified the site of entry of the coronary flow into the pulmonary artery. The flow disturbance was detected on the aortic surface of the pulmonary artery opposite the portion from where the flow from a patent ductus is usually identified. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound identified the flow disturbance in the pulmonary artery in only three of the children. The two youngest patients did not demonstrate turbulence on pulsed Doppler ultrasound, but they were not examined by color Doppler ultrasound. The accuracy of noninvasive detection of pulmonary artery origin of the left coronary artery by ultrasound is improved by the use of a combined echocardiographic approach.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-eight anesthetized mongrel dogs were studied 2 to 74 months after experimental myocardial infarction in order to examine the effects of procainamide, lidocaine and acetylstrophanthidin on conduction within the infarcted region and the way such effects relate to changes in body surface potentials and antiarrhythmic efficacy. In each animal, 100 to 200 QRS complexes in the X, Y, Z leads were signal averaged, vector summed and high pass filtered at 50 Hz. Susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia was evaluated using routine programmed ventricular extrastimulation in the anesthetized open chest animal. Epicardial electrograms were sequentially recorded at 45 standard sites within the infarcted region and referenced to the beginning of the QRS complex. Of the three agents, only procainamide exhibited antiarrhythmic action whereas lidocaine and acetylstrophanthidin produced inconsistent effects. Procainamide prolonged the time at which activity in the epicardial electrographic recordings ended relative to the beginning of the body surface QRS complex. This effect was significantly greater in electrograms that ended late in the QRS complex in the control state than for those that ended earlier. Such preferential effect on more abnormal sites was reflected on the body surface as a greater effect of procainamide in prolonging the lower energy terminal portion of the signal-averaged QRS complex than the earlier high energy portion. In contrast, lidocaine significantly prolonged the time at which electrograms ended only for those relatively normal electrograms that ended early in the QRS complex in the control state. In the signal-averaged body surface QRS complex, lidocaine produced a small but significant prolongation of the early high energy portion of the QRS complex but no change in the late portion. Acetylstrophanthidin produced a significant prolongation in early-ending electrograms and, surprisingly, significantly shortened the end time of electrograms that ended late in the QRS complex in the control state. Such effects were not reflected, however, on the body surface because acetylstrophanthidin had no significant effect on either the early or the late portion of the QRS complex. It is concluded that procainamide's differential effect between early- and late-ending electrograms is detected on the body surface by a greater prolongation in the terminal portion of the QRS complex. The signal-averaged body surface QRS complex is less sensitive in detecting the more subtle effects on conduction caused by lidocaine and acetylstrophanthidin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The effect of sympathetic stimulation on responses to programmed ventricular stimulation was studied in dogs without myocardial infarction (Group I: n = 5), with transmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group II: n = 6) and with nontransmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group III: n = 9). Ventricular effective refractory period during sympathetic stimulation decreased by 16 +/- 18, 1 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 8 ms (mean +/- SD) in viable muscle of the inferoapical left ventricle in Groups I, II and III, respectively, suggesting efferent sympathetic denervation by transmural myocardial infarction only. Sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was induced more easily during sympathetic stimulation in six of the six dogs with transmural infarction, but in only two of the nine dogs with nontransmural infarction (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that the partial sympathetic denervation produced by transmural myocardial infarction enhances the ease of induction of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during sympathetic stimulation. A similar mechanism may lead to increased risk for lethal arrhythmias during periods of high sympathetic tone in patients with transmural myocardial infarction.\r"

At the end of this period, the hearts were injected with rhodamine dye and quickly frozen. Ultraviolet NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) rhodamine fluorescence photography was used to localize the border between normally perfused and ischemic tissue and determine the site of electrodes in relation to this border. Before coronary ligation, extracellular K+ ranged from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 mM in these four zones. After ligation, extracellular K+ accumulated in the ischemic and central ischemic zones in a pattern characterized by an initial rapid increase for approximately 5 min, followed by a slowly rising plateau phase, reaching maximal levels of 9.8 +/- 2.0 and 14.4 +/- 4.4 mM, respectively.

No significant changes in K+ occurred in the normal zone throughout the ischemic period.

In normal Tyrode's solution (4 mM potassium, 2.7 mM calcium) clofilium (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) increased action potential duration. Although only 2 of 10 normal Purkinje fibers developed early after depolarizations and early afterdepolarization-initiated triggered activity, 10 of 11 ischemic Purkinje fibers developed these features. Consequently, action potentials in ischemic fibers were prolonged to durations greater than 10 s. The triggered activity in the ischemic Purkinje fibers produced repetitive activity in adjacent normal ventricular muscle. In vivo, 3 days after ligation, the administration of 3 to 10 mg/kg clofilium induced grouped beating. Action potentials recorded subsequently from these same hearts in vitro showed early afterdepolarizations, triggered activity and a similar grouping of responses. Therefore, clofilium differentially produced early afterdepolarizations in ischemic Purkinje fibers. This is a mechanism by which clofilium could be arrhythmogenic in an ischemic heart.\r"

The maximum falls in FEV1 were 21.9 +/- 2.3% (mean +/- SEM; n = 8) and 5.5 +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SEM; n = 8) after the first and second exercises, respectively. Serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) and plasma histamine and catecholamine levels in venous blood were measured with a microchemotaxis and two radioenzymatic techniques, respectively. There was a significant increase in NCA and plasma histamine concentrations after both exercise challenges, and there was no significant difference in the release of these mediators between the two exercise tests. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that the NCA detected after the first and second exercise tests had molecular sizes of approximately 600,000 daltons. There was no significant time-dependent increase in plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations after either exercise task, even though the patients were refractory to exercise-induced asthma after the second exercise. These results suggest that the refractory period in exercise-induced asthma is not caused by mediator depletion, as indicated by NCA and histamine measurements, or by protection of the airways through catecholamine release.\r"

A regimen of inhaled salbutamol alone was compared to inhaled salbutamol combined with ipratropium bromide. Twenty-five children ranging in age from 5 to 15 years were enrolled in the study. Children with FEV1 less than or equal to 55% predicted were eligible to participate in the study. Subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion into one of two treatment groups. Both groups received an initial dose of salbutamol by nebulizer of 150 micrograms/kg (0.03 cc/kg), followed by six consecutive doses of 50 micrograms/kg (0.01 cc/kg) at 20-minute intervals. In one group of subjects, 250 micrograms (1.0 ml) of ipratropium bromide respirator solution was added to the salbutamol administered at the time of the initial inhalation, and at 40 and 80 minutes, whereas the remaining subjects received a placebo with salbutamol at those times. Formal one-way statistical ANOVA with change in percent predicted FEV1 as a response variable confirmed there was a statistically significant difference at all time points caused by drug regimen during the 150-minute observation period. There was no significant difference in side effects reported in the two groups. Significant additional bronchodilation achieved with salbutamol and ipratropium bromide together indicates that there is likely a substantial cholinergic element to the bronchospasm observed in acute exacerbations of asthma in the pediatric age group.\r"

Opioid agonists like morphine, Leu-enkephalin, and Met-enkephalin, enhanced antigen-induced histamine release from mixed peritoneal cells of rats in vitro; this enhancement was effectively antagonized by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Naloxone, per se, decreased anaphylactic mortality in doses of 10 mg/kg, while it increased mortality in a dose of 1 mg/kg. Reduced IgE antibody titer, measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, decreased hemagglutination titer to sheep red blood cells, blocked histamine release from mixed peritoneal cells of rats in vitro induced by antigen, but had no significant effect when histamine release was induced by compound 48/80. Thus, it appears that endogenous opioids are involved in humoral immune responses.\r"

The potency of each allergen was presented in terms of median effective dose (ED50), and comparison between different allergens and between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was made by computing the relative potency. The ED50 of the allergens was found to be nearly identical (grass, 13.5; D. pteronyssinus, 12.3; mugwort, 9.6 activity units by RAST (AUR)/ml) with the exception of birch (22 AUR/ml). Grass and D. pteronyssinus demonstrated a lower ED50 in symptomatic subjects (3.3 and 2.8 AUR/ml, respectively) than in asymptomatic subjects (85 and 27 AUR/ml, respectively). The lower fiducial limits of ED50 in symptomatic subjects demonstrated to be a cutoff point, since they included only 5% and 12% of asymptomatic reactors to grass and D. pteronyssinus, respectively. We conclude that probit analysis applied to the distribution of threshold doses of allergen extracts is a useful method to evaluate skin sensitivity in epidemiologic surveys. We believe that the ED50 is a practical and reliable allergy index.\r"

  ".W": "Disseminated varicella infection is a potentially life-threatening complication of chronic high-dose corticosteroid (CS) or immunosuppressive therapy. A review of the literature indicates that, with one possible exception, this complication has not occurred in a CS-dependent subject with asthma. We present in this article the clinical features and autopsy findings of a steroid-dependent subject with asthma who died of acute, disseminated varicella. A 16-year-old poorly compliant, steroid-dependent subject with asthma received two courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone during a 3-week period, followed by a tapering schedule of oral prednisone. During this time, she was exposed to chickenpox. She subsequently developed a classic varicella rash, sever back pain, rapidly progressive hepatic failure, pneumonitis, and encephalopathy. Death ensued 3 days after the onset of the rash. Evidence of disseminated varicella infection was confirmed at autopsy. This case illustrates that a small number of subjects with severe asthma receiving high-dose CS need to be considered as a separate, high-risk group for developing disseminated varicella. We recommend that the immune status of these patients to varicella-zoster virus be assessed by a serum titer. If these patients are nonimmune, they would be candidates for varicella-zoster immune globulin on exposure, and for acyclovir therapy should varicella dissemination occur.\r"

Despite acute symptoms, patients did not take medications of any kind by any route during 36 hours. Several statistical methods (eg, Student's t test, analysis of variance, cosinor, chi-square, etc.) were used to validate both circadian and circannual rhythms of these symptoms in the group as a whole, as well as in subgroups related to age, sex, etc. Large-amplitude circadian rhythms with early morning peak times (eg, approximately 6 AM) were validated for sneezing, stuffy nose, and runny nose (with p less than 0.0001) but not for wheeze or cough. Such time-dependent changes were related neither to age (from 10 to 80 years) nor to sex. However, small differences were observed in subgroups sorted with regard to duration of disease (old versus new cases), smoking habits, and geographic location (north versus south France). Reanalysis of data taking into account interindividual differences revealed that the respective peak times of the three major symptoms occurred in the early morning in about 60% to 70% of the patients. Annual changes were validated as well with the annual peak time being January to April. The proposed interpretation of both circadian and circannual rhythms suggests taking into account endogenous component rhythms (eg, involving metabolic, immunologic, and endocrine systems), since they contribute to time-dependent changes in the human susceptibility to antigens. In addition, the elevated severity of symptoms in the morning experienced by 60% to 70% of patients should serve as a guide to individually optimize dosing time(s) of medications, such as antihistamines.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between allergy and childhood asthma was investigated. We hypothesized that if allergy were a factor in aggravating asthma, we should find that allergy (defined by symptoms and numbers of positive prick skin tests) increased with increasing severity of asthma. One hundred forty-two children with asthma, referred to a pulmonologist and an allergist, 123 of whom were skin tested, were graded according to clinical severity and compared to a group of 29 normal individuals, 48 patients with allergic rhinitis, and 52 patients with cystic fibrosis. The 29 symptom-free individuals had only one positive skin test among them, whereas 65% of the clinic patients with asthma had three or more positive skin tests (p less than 0.001). This compared with 35.4% of the patients with rhinitis (p less than 0.001) and 14% of the patients with cystic fibrosis (p less than 0.001). There was an increase in the number and size of positive skin tests with increasing severity of asthma. Similarly, there was increased reporting of allergic symptoms, such as sensitivity to animals with increasing severity of asthma. These data indicate that atopy is associated with asthma in a crude dose-response fashion, and children with chronic, steroid-dependent asthma are often highly atopic, easily sensitized, and form IgE antibodies to a broad range of allergens.\r"

We examined a cross-section of infants and toddlers to determine whether the severity of asthma is associated with allergy as has been reported in older children with asthma. We identified a group of highly atopic infants and preschool children who have serum IgE at least 10 times the mean + 1 SE for age, multiple positive RASTs with early formation of IgE to inhalant antigens, and circulating B cells that spontaneously form IgE when these are cultured in vitro. Such highly atopic infants and preschool children were statistically more likely to have chronic asthma requiring multiple continuous medication compared to the rest of the population (p less than 0.01).\r"

To assess further the clinical importance of positive VSTs in such individuals, we skin tested 33 subjects stung in the field during the preceding 12 months without reaction, and 33 persons who denied being stung in the preceding 3 years. Among the recently stung group, 12/33 had at least one positive VST (greater than or equal to 2+) at 1.0 microgram/ml, whereas 5/33 had positive VST at 0.1 microgram/ml. In contrast, only 2/33 nonstung subjects had positive VST at 1.0 microgram/ml, and none were positive at 0.1 microgram/ml. To estimate, prospectively, the sensitization rate after insect stings, we studied a third group of 11 nonsensitive patients with negative skin tests to Hymenoptera. After a deliberate in-hospital honeybee sting, only 1/11 developed a persistently positive honeybee VST. From among the three groups, we then performed nine sting challenges in eight patients with positive VSTs, and all stings were tolerated without significant reaction. We also measured IgE antibodies to Hymenoptera venoms in random blood bank donors. During April to May, 2/216 sera contained elevated venom-specific IgE antibodies, whereas 14/201 sera collected from October to November contained elevated venom-specific IgE antibodies. We conclude that a small but appreciable portion of the population has venom-specific IgE antibodies and that the prevalence is seasonably variable. Our data indicate that persons recently stung without significant reaction contribute to this group but that only a small portion of this group is at risk for a systemic reaction with a future sting.\r"

The present study was undertaken to examine the possible role of these immune complexes in inflammatory cell activation. Twelve patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis, two with primary Sjogren's syndrome, and three patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were studied. Of these 17 patients, 10 were IgE-containing CIC positive, and seven patients were IgE-containing CIC negative. Polyethylene glycol-precipitated IgE-containing CICs and IgG-containing CICs of these patients were coated on plastic wells and incubated with suspensions of neutrophils. As a parameter of cell activation, superoxide release (SOR) was measured by cytochrome C reduction in the supernatant after 30, 60, and 90 minutes. There was a significant SOR up to 38% of the zymosan control when IgE-containing CICs were incubated with neutrophils. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the level of IgE-containing CICs and the amount of SOR, but not between the level of IgG-containing CICs and the amount of SOR. These results suggest a possible role for IgE-containing CICs in the activation of inflammatory cells in connective tissue diseases.\r"

  ".W": "A 29-year-old female subject had been working for 13 years in a company producing biscuits. She was exposed intermittently to an alkaline hydrolysis wheat gluten derivative (AHGD) that was incorporated into marshmallows. Five years before being referred, she started reporting rhinoconjunctivitis and asthmatic symptoms immediately after handling AHGD. When she was first assessed, she had avoided contact with AHGD for 1 year, and she was asymptomatic. Normal spirometry and bronchial responsiveness to histamine (provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1, 22 mg/ml) were obtained. There was a positive allergy skin test to ragweed pollen and to AHGD at 0.01 mg/ml. Skin tests with individual extracts of cereals, including wheat, were negative. Inhalation challenge with AHGD for 15 seconds caused immediate rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchoconstriction (maximum fall of 40% in FEV1 30 minutes after the exposure) with complete recovery 2 hours later. There was no reaction thereafter, and the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was not significantly changed (13.1 mg/ml) 9 hours after the challenge. Inhalation challenge with wheat flour containing native gluten for 30 minutes did not cause any symptoms or significant change in FEV1. IgE RAST counts were greater with the AHGD than with gluten and the whole wheat extract; the opposite was generally found with sera from individuals with baker's asthma and wheat food allergy. With the serum of the affected worker, AHGD completely inhibited the corresponding RAST, but gluten did not. With wheat food allergy, AHGD was relatively inactive inhibition of the wheat and gluten RAST, but gluten was effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of experimental animals revealed marked increase in the total cell, lymphocyte, and macrophage numbers; the findings were similar to those in human HP. The BAL lymphocytes were mostly Thy 1.2 positive. Lyt-1 positive cells predominated Lyt-2 positive cells. Anti-Tv IgG antibodies and delayed-type hypersensitivity footpad reactions against Tv were detected in animals with HP. Cyclosporin A (CyA), a potent immunosuppressive drug, had marked effects on the development of HP in this model. When CyA was administered throughout the course of Tv inoculations, the granulomatous pneumonitis was markedly suppressed, and an increase in BAL lymphocytes, Thy 1.2 positive cells, was suppressed. When CyA was administered only during the first half period of the Tv treatment, suppression of the disease was minimal; when CyA was administered in the latter half, both the HP lesions and the increase in BAL cell lymphocyte numbers were significantly suppressed. These results indicate that a series of transnasal administration of Tv in mice may provide a good model for human HP.\r"

Furthermore, study of isolated eosinophil function in asthma has been complicated by difficult purification methods and, now, the presence of hypodense eosinophils. In our study, eosinophils were isolated from normal subjects and patients with asthma. Two principal evaluations were performed: (1) a comparison of the density-gradient profiles on peripheral blood leukocytes from normal subjects and patients with asthma and (2) a comparison of the chemiluminescence (CL) response with normal dense eosinophils from these two study groups. Granulocyte preparations were initially isolated from Ficoll-Hypaque gradients and were then applied to a continuous Percoll density gradient. In asthma, 40.8 +/- 5.8% of the peripheral blood eosinophils were hypodense (defined as a density less than 1.081 gm/ml), whereas normal subjects had only 9.1 +/- 1.9% of this subpopulation (p less than 0.01). Functional assessment of purified (greater than 90%) normal dense eosinophils was made by measurement of CL to opsonized zymosan particles and the soluble stimulus phorbol myristate acetate. In asthma, eosinophil CL to zymosan, but not phorbol myristate acetate, was significantly less. Differences in eosinophil CL between normal subjects and subjects with asthma did not correlate with the severity of airway obstruction or the peripheral blood eosinophil count. The reasons for the appearance of hypodense eosinophils and diminished metabolic activity in asthma are not established but raise the possibility that their presence represents previous eosinophil activation.\r"

The clinical response was measured early (the wheal at 20 minutes) and late (induration at 6 hours). We assessed cutaneous responsiveness to histamine before and 6 hours after injection (intradermally) of ragweed (n = 5, antigen group) and diluent (n = 4, 10% glycerin in 0.9% NaCl, sham group); we measured the wheal in response to histamine (1.0 ng to 0.1 mg, intradermally), constructed a dose-response curve, and interpolated the provocative dose (milligrams) of histamine required to create a wheal 10 mm larger than the response to saline control. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained before and after injection of either ragweed or diluent. Consistent with the human late-phase response, neutrophils and eosinophils were present in the dermis at 1 hour, maximal at 6 hours, and decreased at 24 hours. Mononuclear cells increased significantly at 6 hours and were the predominant cells present at 24 hours after antigen. The late clinical response correlated only with influx of eosinophils (rs = 0.85; p less than 0.005). Histamine responsiveness increased markedly after antigen (p less than 0.0001), did not change after glycerin diluent (sham), and was correlated with the intensity of neutrophil influx at 6 hours (rs = 0.69; p less than 0.05), and to a much greater degree with mononuclear cell influx at 6 hours (rs = 0.85; p less than 0.005).\r"

In order to study this permeability change in human alveolar macrophages, we examined alveolar macrophages electrophysiologically at a single channel level. We observed two types of Ca-activated K channel currents having conductances of 218 +/- 2 and 32 +/- 0.6 picosiemens in symmetrical 154 mmol/L KCl solutions. The characteristics, such as voltage dependency and Ca sensitivity, as well as channel conductance, were different between these two types of channel currents. Quinine (a blocker of Ca-activated K conductance), 0.5 mmol/L, reduced these channel currents by 45 +/- 8% and 31 +/- 8%. Quinine, 0.5 mmol/L, also inhibited chemiluminescence and leukotriene B4 release by 82 +/- 6 to 88 +/- 3% and 88 +/- 2%, respectively. These results suggest the presence of two types of Ca-activated K channels, which may be related to the release of inflammatory mediators from human alveolar macrophages.\r"

The inhibition of chemiluminescence by ketotifen concentrations of 0.12 and 0.24 mmol/L was also observed in macrophages stimulated with zymosan activated serum (54 +/- 7 and 80 +/- 6%, respectively). Moreover, ketotifen, 0.24 mmol/L, inhibited Ca-activated K channel currents by 44 +/- 7% (large currents) and 48 +/- 13% (small currents).

Relative potency values for the polymerized extracts obtained by PLST were much lower than those obtained by ELISA inhibition, but results were significantly (r = 0.95; p less than 0.01) correlated.

The diets were designed to make minimal changes in the standard American diet by the use of well-accepted normal foods. The average daily composition of the diet was 50% carbohydrate (complex 35%, simple 15%), 35% fat (P:S 0.7), and 15% protein; it contained 100 mg cholesterol, 1 gm sodium, and 14.5 gm neutral detergent fiber per 1,000 kcal. The acceptability of the menus was examined through questionnaires administered after the experimental diet period. Subjects rated the menus and individual foods and made recommendations for improvement of the menus. Most subjects (33 of 41 responding) rated the menu better than or almost as good as their usual diet. Few (9) were ever hungry during the 13-week period. During the study, a number of biochemical parameters were measured; the measurements indicated beneficial results. Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose responses were all improved after consumption of the menu. The results indicate that with minimal changes in the normal U.S. diet, acceptable menus that have beneficial effects on risk factors for heart disease and diabetes can be developed.\r"

Participants ranged in age from 25 to 64 years and resided in three socioeconomically distinct neighborhoods of San Antonio, TX: low income, middle income, and upper income. A scale was constructed to assess the degree to which individuals avoided six dietary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol. Women of both ethnic groups were found to avoid saturated fat and cholesterol to a greater degree than men, scoring higher on five of the six components of the scale. Saturated fat/cholesterol avoidance increased significantly with increased socioeconomic status in both ethnic groups. Although there were no ethnic differences in overall saturated fat/cholesterol avoidance, more non-Hispanic whites recognized milk, eggs, and visible fat on meat as food sources to avoid. The scale described in this paper provides useful information about the specific food components recognized as dietary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol and helps identify those population groups that would benefit from nutrition education programs. Because of its simplicity and ease of administration, the scale may be a useful tool in epidemiological research.\r"

Boys had higher intakes per day and per kilogram body weight than girls for all nutrients (p less than .0001), but there were no sex differences in nutrients per 1,000 kcal. The only racial difference detected was a higher myristic acid intake in whites (p less than .02). There was a 16% decline in dietary cholesterol intake between 1978 and 1982. Three shifts in fatty acid intake increased the P:S ratio from 0.29 in 1973 to 0.45 in 1978: (a) a 5% decline in oleic acid, coupled with a 5% rise in linoleic acid; (b) a quadrupling of linolenic acid; and (c) less stearic and more myristic acid, with palmitic acid unchanged. Total fat intake provided 38% of the calories in each survey, but the changes in proportions of fatty acids paralleled trends in food consumption patterns and nutrient sources. Despite the changes, few children met prudent diet recommendations, and serum total cholesterol and very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change over time.\r"

The 24-hour food recall was used to assess eating habits using the Synectics method. At the beginning of the study, there were no differences in food recall scores between the EFNEP and the control groups. After 6 months of instruction in the EFNEP group, there was a significant increase in food recall score for that group and no change in the control group. The improvements observed in the EFNEP group resulted from increased intakes from the milk, protein, and fruit and vegetable food groups. The program characteristics that led to those changes were determined to be in the length of the EFNEP visit, the number of EFNEP visits, and the EFNEP instruction topics. These results show that the California EFNEP is effective in producing significant changes in the eating habits of the low-income individuals it serves.\r"

Program components included training for meat managers, taste testing for consumers, recipes and customer information brochures, and labels on individual meat packages to assist in the identification of leaner cuts of meat. The program was implemented through grocery stores in two of the towns selected for MHHP intervention. Population-based telephone surveys indicated that respondents in the intervention towns were more aware of the lean meats program than those in the comparison communities. Knowledge of lean cuts of meat and low-fat preparation methods also increased as a result of the program. Independently collected sales data from five participating and two control stores provided some indications of a greater interest in lean cuts and 80% lean ground beef as a result of the intervention program. Programs such as this have potential for community-wide nutrition education.\r"

Almost 20% demonstrated substantial affective symptomatology, whereas 15.6% had a brief psychotic episode with full remission, and 40.6% showed signs of organic deterioration. These results suggest that diverse underlying pathologic processes may present initially as late onset schizophreniform illness.

  ".W": "A sample of several hundred elderly residents of Alameda County was recontacted after 5 years to determine the effects over time of different social support and demographic variables on health status. The follow-up investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between respondents' social support resources in 1980 and their subsequent self-rated health. Indeed, social contacts in 1980, together with age and financial need, enabled us to correctly \"predict\" respondents' subsequent health status in close to two-thirds of the cases. As anticipated, however, the variable most strongly associated with self-rated health in the earlier cross-sectional study--illness of a mate during the preceding 6 months--disappeared as a predictor variable in the longitudinal study. This finding is in keeping with the literature on bereavement and other stressful life events which demonstrates that the health impact of such stressors is in most cases time-limited. The study findings support earlier research demonstrating the important role of social support for health maintenance and disease prevention in the elderly. They further underscore the need for intervention strategies designed to strengthen the network resources of those elders at high risk for social isolation.\r"

While hospital patients can provide a relatively economical and convenient source of controls, hospital controls may have diseases independently associated with the exposures being studied. Results of a recent case-control study of multiple myeloma suggest that the problems of using hospital controls may be exacerbated in studies of diseases affecting the elderly, especially when considering risk factors which might be associated with chronic diseases. Apparently, the authors have encountered a modern analog of \"Berkson's bias\" in which cancer cases are referred to a tertiary care center for a single disease. On the other hand, noncancer patients who might serve as controls tend to be referred selectively if they have multiple diseases. This article reports some of the difficulties encountered in a case-control study whose mean case age was 63.4 years and suggests that community controls selected by random digit dialing may be preferable to hospital controls for hypothesis-generating case-control studies of diseases in the elderly.\r"

The authors studied the effects of a closely supervised exercise program designed specifically for elders with health problems and functional limitations. Tests, selected for their relevance to clinical patient management, included the Self Evaluation of Life Function questionnaire, treadmill performance, and tests of autonomic nervous system and neuromotor functions. Ambulatory volunteers, aged 64 to 83 years, with noncardiac health problems, were randomly assigned to a control group (CG; n = 17) or a 16-week exercise group (EG; 3 hr/wk, n = 18). Nine of the control and 13 of the exercise subjects completed the study. All EG dropouts were due to illness. EG attendance averaged 87%, and subjects trained at a heart rate (HR) of 103 +/- 5 beats/min (SD) (98% of prescription HR). Though EG test responses showed a tendency to improve, none reached statistical significance. This result was affected by the small number completing the study and the variability inherent in such a sample. Though these impaired elderly subjects enthusiastically and safely participated with high attendance and at an exercise intensity adequate to expect benefit, measurable training effects were not demonstrated.\r"

While it is known that many hospitals rely on education and advice provided by an ethics committee, little data exist on the responses of nursing homes, despite the unique nature of ethical issues in a long-term care setting. The present paper reports findings from a national survey of administrators of 4504 nursing homes in which mechanisms for handling ethical dimensions in patient care were investigated. Results from 29% of respondents reveal that few nursing homes have established ethics committees (2% of the sample) and that committee formation appears positively associated with facility size and religious affiliation. Committees that have been formed engage in policy review (81%), advisory case review (67%) and education (45%). Few committees include patients or their representatives as members, and few have the authority to make binding decisions (26%). While the most effective response to ethical issues in medical decision-making is being debated, standing committees provide one means to contribute to the quality of decision-making by patients, their family members and their physicians. However, broader inclusion of patient perspectives and education of members regarding ethical analysis are necessary precursors to effective functioning of ethics committees in long-term care.\r"

In the Alzheimer's patients, significant but moderate positive associations were found between the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), a comprehensive rating tool designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease, and performance on the experimental tasks. A significant correlation was also found between the results of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), a less specific dementia assessment instrument, and the CDR but not between the SPMSQ and the performance measure. When compared to nine normal subjects matched for gender, age, and education, the cognitively impaired subjects required more assistance and time (P less than .01) in completing the tasks. The findings support the conclusion that severity of dementia and performance on activities of daily living tasks are related but distinct concepts and should be measured separately.\r"

Data from a study of urban elderly are presented to demonstrate how this can be done and to reexamine the meaning of self-reported illness and disability. One hundred thirteen subjects 74 to 95 years old, recruited from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of the elderly population of Cleveland, Ohio, participated in structured interviews and epidemiologically based medical examinations, conducted by a physician-nurse team at the place of residence. The presence or absence of 11 common chronic conditions was determined according to preestablished criteria, by self-report and, separately, by medical diagnostic evaluation. Functional disability was estimated by self-report and by physician-nurse assessment, using established measures of mobility and activities of daily living. Results indicate that interview self-report can provide useful estimates of the prevalence of medical conditions and functional disabilities in elderly populations, although self-report alone is not a sufficiently sensitive measure to be used for case-finding or diagnosis. When functional disabilities are matched against the specific medical conditions that cause them and disease-specific mortality is also taken into account, a three-dimensional classification results that has implications for future clinical and survey work with the elderly.\r"

Pill and liquid medication bottles with and without child-resistant closure mechanisms were tested. In addition, other types of medication packaging were evaluated, such as nitroglycerin patches. All subjects could open each of the non-child-resistant containers, though none of the child-resistant containers could be opened by all participants. For child-resistant containers, dramatic differences were observed in the proportion of subjects who could open the various designs and in the amount of time required. Subjects' comments and observations of subjects' efforts provided possible reasons for some of these differences. The results suggest that when child-resistant containers are used, consideration of the type of medication container can significantly reduce inconvenience to older persons. Containers without child-resistant mechanisms provide the best option for elderly people when access by small children is not an issue.\r"

Two types of vaccines, split-product vaccine (SPV) and whole virus vaccine (WVV), were used. Three different doses, 0.5 mL (the standard volume, 1X), or 1.0 mL (2X), and 1.5 mL (3X) of each of the two vaccines were compared. The size of each of the six groups was between 23 and 26 subjects. The mean ages in each of the groups ranged from 71 to 74 years. No difference in local or systemic reaction was noted among the six groups. A dose-response effect was observed for the SPV recipients to the influenza A/Chile/83 (H1N1) strain. The geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition (HI)titer (GMT) was 1:76 after the 3X dose vs 1:38 after the 1X dose (P less than 0.025). To the influenza A/Philippines/82 (H3N2) strain the GMT was 1:70 after the 3X dose vs 1:43 after the 1X dose. A similar trend was noted for the influenza B/USSR/83 strain. A (HI) titer of greater than or equal to 1:40 for all the strains was seen in greater than 70% of the split product vaccine recipients only after the 3X dose. For the WVV recipients, increasing doses did not result in increasing GMT for any of the three vaccine strains. In addition, HI titers greater than or equal to 1:40 were not uniformly seen in greater than 70% of the vaccine recipients at any of the three whole virus vaccine doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte disorder among the elderly, yet risk factors are not known. This study identifies risk factors for dehydration in acutely ill nursing home residents. All 339 elderly resident of two nursing homes who developed an acute illness requiring hospitalization during 1984 were included in the study. The 173 patients having a serum Na less than 150 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN:Cre) less than 20 were designated controls; 91 patients having a serum Na greater than 150 mg/dL or a serum BUN:Cre greater than 25 were designated cases. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals were calculated for age, sex, chronic conditions, acute illnesses, medications, functional status measures, and season. Acutely ill dehydrated patients were female (OR, 3.3); over 85 years old (OR, 2.2); had more than four chronic conditions (OR, 4.0); took more than four medications (OR, 2.8); and were bedridden (OR, 2.9). Among the most severely dehydrated (serum Na greater than 150 mg/dL and BUN:Cre greater than 25), the odds ratios for the above factors were strengthened and other factors, such as inability to feed oneself and type of acute diagnosis, emerged as risk factors. Among the variables unrelated to functional status, laxatives (OR, 3.2) and chronic infections (OR, 1.8) were risk factors. We conclude that a group at high risk for dehydration can be defined and that they are better characterized by the number of chronic diseases and debilitated functional status than by acute disease processes.\r"

In the non-Alzheimer abnormal mental status group, the average number was 5.5 in males, 4.6 in females. In contrast, the number of diagnoses in the Alzheimer group was 2.9 in males and 2.8 in females (P less than 0.0001). Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accidents were less frequent in the Alzheimer population.

  ".W": "The injection of (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 mice with parental DBA/2 lymphoid cells leads to a lupus-like disease in which IgG autoantibodies are targeted to certain nuclear and cell surface antigens. To investigate further the extent of antibody diversity in this graft-vs-host (GVH) model, we studied the specificity of antihistone antibodies induced by the GVH reaction. High levels of IgG antibodies to histones H1 and H2B were detected whereas responses to H2A, H3, and H4 were only marginally elevated above pre-GVH levels. Immunoblotting analysis further revealed that the response to H2B was focused on epitopes that most likely reside in the N-terminal region. In contrast, F1 mice immunized with H2B/RNA complexes in adjuvant produced antibodies to the N terminus as well as to other regions of the H2B molecule. Thus, the antihistone response stimulated by the GVH reaction is only a fraction of the potentially activatable B cell repertoire. We also determined whether antibodies that arise spontaneously in genetically predisposed lupus strains were restricted in their histone reactivity. The response to core histones was highly variable among individual animals of the NZB/NZW and MRL-lpr/lpr strains despite their inbred nature. However, nearly all mice exhibited a preferential reactivity for epitopes in histone regions that are lost after partial trypsin digestion of chromatin. These data demonstrating autoantibody responses that are limited to particular histone regions support a mechanism by which B cells are selectively activated in murine lupus. The predominant production of antibodies to histone regions that are exposed in nucleosomes raises the possibility that chromatin is an antigenic stimulus for histone-specific B cells in this disease.\r"

Both strains of mice responded to LPS with a 20- to 30-fold increase in plasma amyloid P component (AP) levels. There were no differences in the response between males and females or between FO and CO treatment groups. The data demonstrated that cultured peritoneal macrophages (M phi) respond to LPS stimulation with increased secretion of AP. In contrast to plasma AP levels, the MO response to LPS stimulation, as measured by production of AP, was influenced by both gender and diet. Although M phi from both male and female mice on the CO diet and male mice on the FO diet responded similarly, those from female mice on the FO diet secreted only 25 to 35% as much AP as did the other three groups. There were no dietary effects on the LPS-induced serum amyloid A protein response nor was there detectable serum amyloid A protein produced by the M phi. These results demonstrate that unstimulated, resident peritoneal M phi secrete AP as a normal constituent and in increasing amounts in response to LPS stimulation.\r"

This series of experiments examined the contribution of humoral immunity and C to myelin destruction. As in multiple sclerosis, mice persistently infected with TMEV had elevated levels of IgG and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunoblot studies revealed that even in animals exhibiting profound demyelination, IgG in the serum and CSF was directed primarily at virus antigen rather than at normal myelin components. Inflammatory cells positive for Ig were distributed mainly around blood vessels, but occasionally they infiltrated the spinal cord parenchyma. Rare examples of myelin sheaths positive for IgG were found by immunoelectron microscopy in spinal cord sections from infected mice; the third component of complement (C3) was commonly found in the walls of CNS blood vessels but not on myelin. Neither serum nor CSF IgG from infected mice bound to myelin sheaths or other CNS components in sections of normal syngeneic spinal cord. There were significantly more demyelinating lesions in infected mice depleted of C components with cobra venom factor. These data do not support a humoral autoimmune basis for the CNS demyelination that occurs in association with persistent TMEV infection. However, the humoral immune response directed at TMEV antigens may either limit virus spread or promote virus persistence.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of NaF on C3b receptor (CR1) expression and function in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Plasma membrane expression of CR1 was determined with a monoclonal antibody (3D9); CR1 function was assessed with erythrocytes bearing C3b (EC3b) or C3b oligomers prepared with avidin and biotin. NaF inhibited in a dose-dependent manner CR1-mediated phagocytosis and NaF inhibited f-met-leu-phe or phorbol dibutyrate-induced increases in CR1 expression, with 50% inhibition at 5 mM NaF. Increased plasma membrane expression of CR3 induced by f-met-leu-phe also was inhibited by NaF. However, increased CR1 and CR3 expression due to incubation at 37 degrees C were unaffected by 10 mM NaF. Incubation of PMN with 10 mM NaF depleted 80% of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) after 10 min. However, inhibition of CR1 function was unrelated to ATP level, inasmuch as normal increases in CR1 expression and in phagocytosis occurred 20 min after removal of NaF, whereas ATP levels remained below 25% of normal. Strikingly, internalization of soluble oligomeric C3b ligands was unaffected by 10 mM NaF, which completely inhibited phorbol dibutyrate-induced CR1 internalization and EC3b phagocytosis. We conclude that there are two different mechanisms for increasing plasma membrane expression of CR1, one of which is inhibitable by NaF. Moreover, there are two distinct pathways of CR1 internalization which can also be distinguished by their sensitivity to NaF.\r"

  ".W": "The role of complement and its receptor on erythrocytes (CR1) in the physiologic elimination of large immune complexes from the circulation of humans was assessed. Large radiolabeled soluble tetanus toxoid- anti-tetanus toxoid complexes were injected i.v. into three normal individuals and three patients with SLE. These complexes were prepared in antibody excess and were 45S in size, fixed C and bound to E CR1 in vitro. The percentage of complexes bound in vitro was directly proportional to CR1 number/E in four normal subjects and three SLE patients. After i.v. injection into normal subjects, complexes were cleared rapidly, with a monoexponential rate constant (10.3 to 11% complexes cleared/min). In the SLE patients, clearance was best explained by two phases: the first occurred within the first minute indicating immediate trapping of a fraction of the complexes (19.5 to 25.3% of injected complexes trapped), the second was monoexponential and was similar to the normal range. A large fraction of complexes bound within the first minute to E in vivo; the percentage of binding was variable, ranging from 16.3% to 71.5% and was related to E CR1 number. In a second study complexes were injected that had been attached to autologous E by opsonization with C in vitro. Their elimination was similarly monoexponential, except in one SLE patient in whom there was significant initial trapping (30.9%). A fraction of these complexes were released from E within the first minute, the percentage release being greatest in the patient with the lowest CR1 number (81.4%). E bearing immune complexes remained in the circulation and were not transiently sequestered in the liver or spleen. This is the first study of the clearance of soluble immune complexes in vivo in humans and shows that C and CR1 on E participate in immune complex clearance reactions, and that abnormal clearance can be detected in the form of rapid removal of immune complexes from the circulation.\r"

  ".U": "88116712\r", 
  ".W": "Fura-2, loaded into J774.2 macrophages as the acetoxymethyl ester, is sequestered into intracellular vacuoles within 90 min after the beginning of the loading at 37 degrees C. The dye is also efficiently secreted from the cells. Sequestration and secretion of fura-2 reduce the accuracy of measurements of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in this cell line. Fura-2 is also sequestered and secreted by J774.2 when the dye is loaded into the cytoplasm as the pentapotassium salt by reversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Regardless of the mechanism by which fura-2 is loaded into the cytoplasm, both sequestration and secretion are prevented by 2.5 mM probenecid, a blocker of organic anion transport. Probenecid has no effect on resting or stimulated cytosolic free Ca2+ levels or on FcR-mediated phagocytosis. These findings suggest that macrophages express a transport mechanism for the anionic form of fura-2. This transport system is responsible for the clearance of fura-2 from the cytoplasm of this cell type. Furthermore we suggest that use of probenecid to block secretion and intracellular sequestration of fura-2 may overcome problems arising in the application of this Ca2+ indicator to macrophages and perhaps to other cell types.\r"
