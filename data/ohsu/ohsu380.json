Efficacy was inversely related to the initial beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin level, ranging from 100% at less than 5000 mIU/ml to 81% at greater than 20,000 mIU/ml (p less than 0.05). Uterine bleeding was the most serious side effect. However, the mean change in the hemoglobin value 14 days after treatment was -0.4 gm/dl, and no patient required blood transfusion. This regimen appears to be simple, effective, and safe.\r"

In an attempt to correctly diagnose the presence of tumor and to accurately localize the lesion to a specific gland, steroid hormones in peripheral, ovarian, and adrenal vein serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Little correlation was made in this series with those levels of testosterone (greater than 2 ng/ml) or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (greater than 7000 ng/ml) that have been widely used to predict the presence of such tumors. Peripheral testosterone levels were less than 2 ng/ml in 50% of our patients, and the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level was greater than 7000 ng/ml in only a single patient with an ovarian lipoid cell tumor. Pelvic ultrasonography was found to be of limited value in evaluating nonpalpable tumor because of the small size (less than 2 cm3) of the majority of these neoplasms. The use of selective retrograde venous catheterization to demonstrate significant effluent-peripheral vein androgen gradients served to accurately localize androgen-secreting tumors in all six patients in which it was used. Our data emphasize the potential pitfalls that exist in the preoperative evaluation of patients with these fascinating neoplasms and the importance of a high degree of suspicion on the part of the physician caring for these women.\r"

Ten presentations were vertex, five breech. Half or more of each fetus had been delivered before vaginal reinsertion in eight of the 15. With one exception, all fetuses survived. There were no instances of fetal or maternal trauma. These cases represent a natural and progressive extension of the revolutionary concept behind the Zavanelli maneuver. Contrary to the age-old dicta, the process of vaginal birth, once initiated, does not have to proceed inexorably to completion with either life or death for the fetus in the balance. These cases demonstrate that delivery can be reversed at essentially any moment with excellent potential for fetal survival and relatively insignificant maternal risk.\r"

The use of these techniques allowed the diagnosis of luteinized unruptured follicle in 5% (three patients), sperm antibodies in 5% (three patients), low sperm penetration in 11% (six patients), and human leukocyte antigen-B locus homozygosity in 37% (21 couples). When the incidence of B locus homozygosity among the 57 couples with unexplained infertility was compared with that in 51 fertile couples, the difference was significant at p = 0.025. Thus by adding the diagnostic tools of ultrasound monitoring of folliculogenesis, sperm antibody testing, hamster egg penetration assay, and major histocompatibility antigen typing, the diagnosis of unexplained infertility can be reduced by 60%.\r"

Twenty-eight infants (31.5%) had germinal layer/intraventricular hemorrhage within 1 hour after birth and an additional 15 infants (17%) had germinal layer/intraventricular hemorrhage beyond 1 hour after birth. Infants with germinal layer/intraventricular hemorrhage had a significantly lower gestational age (p less than 0.003) and birth weight (p less than 0.007). Germinal layer/intraventricular hemorrhage within 1 hour after delivery was increased in the infants of women who experienced the active phase of labor regardless of the route of delivery. However, the incidence of germinal layer/intraventricular hemorrhage beyond 1 hour after delivery and the overall incidence were similar in the vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery groups. In addition, there was an increased incidence of progression to grades III and IV hemorrhage regardless of route of delivery in the infants whose mothers experienced the active phase of labor.\r"

No side effects were detected in these healthy mothers and fetuses. A distinct change in Bishop score after 12 hours occurred more often in the prostaglandin E2 than in the placebo group (42% versus 6%, p less than 0.0001). Forty-four women (80%) who had received prostaglandin E2 were admitted in early labor; they required little or no oxytocin for augmentation. The duration of labor and maximum dose of oxytocin infused were significantly decreased in the prostaglandin E2 group, and forceps delivery or primary cesarean sections were performed less often when prostaglandin E2 was used (24% versus 44%, p less than 0.05). The outpatient administration of a single dose of prostaglandin E2 gel is safe in the uncomplicated postdate pregnancy and was found to significantly change the unripe cervix, enhance the onset of labor, minimize the need for oxytocin administration, and encourage a spontaneous vaginal delivery.\r"

In addition, pulsed Doppler spectral recordings of blood flow in the fetal umbilical arteries were made. A systolic/diastolic ratio was then calculated for each fetus. Real-time ultrasound-derived estimated fetal weight with the use of biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference was also calculated. The estimated fetal weights were categorized by placing them in a percentile for gestational age according to published nomograms. Complete birth data and outcomes were obtained in all patients. Both the systolic/diastolic ratio and ultrasound-estimated fetal weight grouped by percentile ranking for gestational age were highly predictive (p = 0.001) of babies who were subsequently born small for gestational age. Seventy-nine percent of the infants small for gestational age had umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios greater than or equal to 4, whereas only 21% had normal systolic/diastolic ratios. Forty-three percent of the infants who were small for gestational age had ultrasound-estimated fetal weights less than or equal to 10th percentile for the gestational age at which it was measured. Umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios, which reflect an increase in peripheral resistance in the placental circulation, showed a highly predictive and discriminatory index for the evaluation of the fetus suspected of having growth retardation.\r"

The aim of this study was to establish whether chlorpromazine exerts similar effects in other rat models characterized by in situ formation of immune complexes. In glomerulonephritis induced by antibodies reactive with an exogenous antigen \"planted\" in glomeruli pretreatment with chlorpromazine prevented formation of \"humps\" and exudative and proliferative lesions. Likewise, chlorpromazine prevented passive reverse Arthus reaction in the skin. In contrast, the drug was ineffective when these lesions were already established, and also failed to inhibit the fulminant course of nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis with an enhanced autologous phase. It is proposed that the antiinflammatory effect of chlorpromazine is due to its ability to block the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators.\r"

The GSS amyloid plaque core antiserum revealed not only birefringent amyloid plaques but also small plaques that cannot be detected by the staining with Congo red dye. Positive immunolabeling was demonstrated in 59% of 34 Japanese patients with CJD, in 100% of 11 patients with GSS, and in none with other neurologic diseases. All cases of CJD of short duration (less than 11 months) were evaluated as being negative, and 95% of 21 long survivors (over 12 months) were positive. This immunohistochemical approach revealed that amyloid plaque is a hallmark of CJD with a long clinical course.\r"

The 12 sarcomas included two leiomyosarcomas, two malignant schwannomas, one synovial sarcoma, and seven malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs). With light and electron microscopic and immunolabeling studies the original and xenografted tumors (the latter for at least two generations) were histopathologically compared. The xenografted leiomyosarcomas showed ultrastructurally a more pronounced leiomyodifferentiation, and one of the malignant schwannomas a more pronounced schwannian differentiation. The second malignant schwannoma and the synovial sarcoma, however, remained unchanged. Five storiform pleomorphic MFHs expressed features that were not observed in the original tumors. Tumor cells of three of these xenografted sarcomas showed leiomyogenic differentiation (filamentous densities, pinocytotic vescicles, and desmin immunoreactivity), whereas cells of the two others demonstrated schwannian differentiation (long cytoplasmic processes, basal lamina). A xenografted myxoid MFH and a pleomorphic MFH gave rise to pleomorphic sarcomas composed of undifferentiated cells. It appeared that under transplantation conditions tumor cells of storiform pleomorphic MFH can differentiate into various directions.\r"

A protocol using serial sections for bio-DISH and DNA extraction was used. The number of positively stained cells and the detection limit were strongly dependent on the treatment of the sections with proteinase K prior to hybridization. At low proteinase K concentration (0.1 micrograms/ml), the detection limit appeared to be 30-40 HPV-16 DNA copies per carcinoma cell, whereas morphology was preserved. A high proteinase K concentration (1-5 micrograms/ml) often resulted in an increase in the number of positively stained cells but also in a poor morphology. The detection limit was improved to at least 20 HPV-16 DNA copies per carcinoma cell.\r"

One hour prior to dosing and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 48 hours after dosing, histamine and saline were injected intradermally into opposite arms. Measurements of resulting wheal areas showed loratadine suppressed wheal formation significantly better than placebo; suppression was dose related. The mean suppression over 48 hours was 16% in placebo-treated subjects and 35%, 45%, 51%, and 67% in the 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg loratadine-treated subjects, respectively. The onset of action occurred within the first hour. Duration of suppression was dose related, ranging from 12 hours with the lowest dose (10 mg) to 48 hours with the higher doses (40 and 80 mg). Incidence of sedation and other side effects were comparable among all doses of loratadine and placebo.\r"

The payor mix of trauma patients will be one of the deciding factors as to whether hospitals will agree to accept designation. A three-year review of payor class on discharge for 2,605 trauma and 55,041 nontrauma admissions to a nonuniversity teaching hospital is presented. Sixty-four percent of all trauma admissions had third-party payor insurance coverage, compared with 72% of all nontrauma admissions (P less than .00001). Twenty-seven percent of trauma admissions were for penetrating injury. Sixty-eight percent of patients admitted for blunt trauma had third-party coverage, while 50% of those admitted for penetrating trauma had third-party coverage. Total commercial insurance coverage was higher for trauma patients than for nontrauma admissions. The payor class mix for trauma patients presented may be representative of similar institutions in a similar geographic setting and may offer assistance to hospitals considering the financial impact of trauma center designation.\r"

We report the first clinical use of PEG-modified Arthrobacter protoformiae uricase (PEG-uricase) to treat hyperuricemia in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and renal insufficiency who was allergic to allopurinol. Two intramuscular injections totaling 3 U/kg body weight during the first 30 hours of treatment lowered the plasma urate level from 910 to 190 mumol/L (15.3 to 3.2 mg/dL), after which a dose of 2 U/kg every 5 to 6 days maintained the plasma urate level at 540 mumol/L (9 mg/dL) or lower. After the injection of PEG-uricase, uricase activity appeared in plasma rapidly, peaking within 24 hours and persisting for approximately 5 days; an inverse relation between plasma uricase activity and plasma urate concentration was noted. The agent was nontoxic and well tolerated. No antibody to either PEG-uricase or unmodified uricase developed over a 3-week period, during which four doses of PEG-uricase were administered. Because of its long circulating life, PEG-uricase is probably a more effective hypouricemic agent than unmodified uricase, which has previously had limited use. As an adjunct to cytolytic therapy for hematologic malignancies when protection from hyperuricemia is needed rapidly, PEG-uricase deserves further study.\r"

The possible mechanisms by which such inflammatory bladder masses might arise are discussed and eight previously reported cases of chronic granulomatous disease with cystitis are reviewed. From this clinical experience, we recommend prolonged antibiotic therapy. In patients who fail to respond to antibiotic therapy, steroids may be cautiously administered.\r"

The technique is particularly attractive because it is noninvasive and relatively simple. Technically satisfactory recordings can be obtained in most patients. In a relatively short period, numerous studies using the Doppler technique to assess diastolic function in children and adults with cardiac disease have been published. This review appraises the current status of applications of Doppler echocardiography and critically examines the strengths, limitations, and ultimate potentials of this new method.\r"

Although neutropenia has long been recognized to predispose to infection, recently other syndromes marked by frequent infections have been shown to be caused by an underlying neutrophil dysfunction. Efforts to define the molecular pathology of such disorders have helped delineate the molecular basis of normal neutrophil function. Advances have been made in defining the roles of the neutrophil's varied receptors in recognition, movement, and adhesive phenomena. Progress in establishing the pathogenesis of chronic granulomatous disease has provided important insights into the enzymatic machinery that normal neutrophils use to produce antimicrobial oxidants. The identification and precise characterization of antimicrobial components, such as defensins, have outlined the potential roles of \"natural antibiotics\" in neutrophil-mediated host-defense functions. These areas of neutrophil function will be reviewed and placed in a clinical context to guide physicians in evaluating children and adults with frequent or unusual infections.\r"

Patients with chronic renal failure who have not yet received dialysis may have symptoms ranging from mild sensorial clouding to delirium and coma. Dialysis itself is associated with at least three distinct disorders of the central nervous system, including the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, dialysis dementia, and progressive intellectual dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy is also a major cause of disability in uremic patients. Aluminum probably contributes to the pathogenesis of dialysis dementia. Parathyroid hormone, the levels of which are elevated in patients with renal failure, also may be a uremic neurotoxin. Biochemically, brain calcium levels are elevated in renal failure, possibly because of the action of parathyroid hormone. Studies on synaptosomes have also shown that parathyroid hormone can affect calcium transport in the brain. Intellectual dysfunction, dialysis dementia, uremic neuropathy, and the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome can be diagnosed when the characteristic clinical findings are present and other causes of nervous system dysfunction have been excluded.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with a 5-month treatment phase and a 9-month observation period after treatment. SETTING: Two referral-based university-affiliated medical centers. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine clinically stable patients with chronic type B hepatitis, all of whom were positive for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis B virus-associated-DNA (HBV-DNA), and DNA polymerase for at least 6 months before entry. Patients included 20 heterosexuals and 19 male homosexuals. INTERVENTIONS: Eighteen patients were treated with a 6-week tapered regimen of prednisone, followed by 90 days treatment with recombinant interferon alpha-2b; 21 patients were untreated controls. Paired liver biopsy specimens of 27 patients (pretreatment and 9 months after treatment) were blindly evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nine treated patients had a sustained loss of HBV-DNA. In addition, eight treated patients lost hepatitis B e antigen and four became negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). When compared with controls the differences were statistically significant for clearance of HBV-DNA and HBsAg (P = 0.035 and 0.037, respectively). Treated patients who had a sustained loss of HBV-DNA had higher initial alanine aminotransferase lower initial DNA and DNA polymerase levels, and were more frequently heterosexual. Patients who responded to treatment with the disappearance of hepatitis B e antigen and HBV-DNA had normal liver function tests and markedly improved liver histology during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The immunologic priming provided by a short course of prednisone used with alpha interferon may be an effective treatment for selected patients with chronic type B hepatitis.\r"

In cases where greater than 1,000 micrograms/g creatinine of beta 2-microglobulinuria was observed (at the time cadmium exposure ended), almost all individuals exposed to cadmium showed deterioration of beta 2-microglobulinuria, whereas in the case of less than 1,000 micrograms/g creatinine of beta 2-microglobulinuria, no significant changes were observed.

To characterize the acute respiratory responses to this gas, 18 nonsmoking normal subjects (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] = 25 +/- 4 yr) were exposed to filtered air or 2 ppm NO2 gas for 1 hr in a 30-m3 environmental chamber on different days, typically 1 wk apart, in a double-blind randomized fashion. Lung function tests included forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, partial expiratory flow at 40% of vital capacity (Vp40), functional residual capacity, and specific airway conductance, and were measured before and after exposure. Airway reactivity to methacholine inhalation was determined within 45 min of each exposure. The dose of methacholine in mg/ml to cause a 40% decrease in specific airway conductance (PD40) was measured. Airway reactivity to methacholine aerosol increased significantly after NO2, which is shown by a decrease in the concentration of methacholine; PD40 (AIR) = 101 +/- 44, PD40 (NO2) = 81 +/- 45 mg/ml, p = .003. No significant changes were noted in the lung function tests after NO2 exposure. These findings indicate that normal nonsmokers exposed to 2.0 ppm NO2 for 1 hr develop an increase in airway reactivity to methacholine aerosol, which is not associated with changes in lung volumes, flow rates, or respiratory symptoms.\r"

The literature regarding perioperative coronary artery spasm is reviewed, and methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are suggested. Preoperative angina at rest appears to be an important identifying factor in patients who experience postoperative coronary spasm. Anatomically, the presence of a relatively normal, dominant right coronary may also indicate increased risk for early post-coronary bypass spasm. Acute hypotension is often the first sign of coronary artery spasm, and conventional treatment methods may only worsen the vasospastic reaction. Peripheral intravenous nitroglycerin infusion has often been unsuccessful treatment while intragraft or intracoronary nitroglycerin injection or administration of calcium channel-blocking drugs, or both, has proven to be effective in reversing the coronary artery spasm and ventricular dysfunction. Reluctance to use vasodilating agents must be overcome, even in the face of hypotension, when evidence of spasm is present.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1964 and 1986, 19 patients underwent resection of both a primary lung cancer and the associated brain metastasis. One patient underwent resection of 2 separate primary lung cancers and the associated metastases. The 12 men and 7 women ranged in age from 42 to 67 years (mean, 54.6 years). The cell type was adenocarcinoma in 12 tumors, squamous or adenosquamous cell in 5, large cell undifferentiated or anaplastic in 2, and malignant carcinoid in 1 tumor. The types of resection were as follows: lobectomy for 12 neoplasms, pneumonectomy for 5, bilobectomy for 2, and wedge resection for 1 neoplasm. Radiotherapy to the brain was given in connection with sixteen of the twenty craniotomies. The patient with 2 separate primary neoplasms survived 19 years before dying 5 months after the second craniotomy. The mean survival is 8.0 +/- 2.1 years (+/- the standard error), and the median survival is 1.67 years. Survival at 1 year was 65 +/- 10.7% and at 5 years, 45 +/- 11.1%. On univariate analysis, the following factors were found to correlate significantly with longer survival: a lung tumor in Stage I or II; negative mediastinal nodes; curative rather than palliative resection of the lung tumor; and age younger than 55 years. However, on multivariate analysis, only curative resection was a significant factor (p less than 0.01). We believe these results justify continued application of this combined surgical approach to patients having limited-stage lung cancer with a solitary brain metastasis.\r"

The cases of 58 patients treated 62 times were reviewed for efficacy of therapy and morbidity. Thrombolytic therapy may be useful in patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis causing critical hemodynamic compromise. It is frequently the only treatment needed. Further, it may help reduce operative risk for those patients in whom complete resolution is not possible. The incidence of systemic embolism is 18%, however, neurological events are usually limited and transient.\r"

The other 8 patients underwent reoperation, and all survived. Reoperation revealed that all leakages were tiny and had no adverse effect on hemodynamics. In all the patients having reoperation, hemoglobinuria disappeared immediately after the procedure. Surface-scanning electron microscopy of the sewing cuff of the St. Jude Medical prosthesis revealed the rough surface structure of the sewing ring. Because of this irregular, shaggy surface structure, greater shearing forces against erythrocytes can be generated when there is perivalvular leakage.\r"

With better medical management, patients with SCA are living longer and what were previously uncommon sequelae are being recognized frequently, including those involving the cardiovascular system. Previous reports on the cardiovascular effects of SCA have focused predominantly on children, but the conclusions remain controversial. To study this question further, 40 adult patients with documented SCA were examined using two-dimensional and Doppler cardiac ultrasound. Valvular structures were normal despite an increased incidence of flow murmurs. Abnormalities were found more frequently in the left heart than the right, as manifested primarily by increased left ventricular mass, and left ventricular and left atrial dilatation with preservation of systolic function. Pulmonary hypertension, which was present in two thirds of the sample, was minimal to moderate as assessed by our Doppler technique. The effects of SCA on the heart seem to be minimal and similar to those of other anemias, predominantly confined to the left atrium and ventricle with passive elevation of pulmonary pressures. Clinical murmurs were most often physiologic; there was no association with myxomatous valvular degeneration or mitral valve prolapse.\r"

Intentional induction of hypothermia is used routinely in cardiac surgery to reduce total body metabolism and oxygen consumption, which is beneficial when an increased tolerance to ischemia is required, such as during total circulatory arrest. Hypothermia is associated with such complications as acidosis, impaired myocardial function, altered blood clotting, decreased kidney and liver function, and intracellular swelling. This review summarizes the laboratory, theoretical, and clinical evidence that the management of blood pH during hypothermia may alter the appearance or magnitude of these deleterious effects.\r"

During the initial weeks of the study, the alprazolam-treated group had lower scores, while the diazepam-treated group had higher scores than the placebo-treated group. However, an end point analysis performed on the final BPRS withdrawal/retardation subfactor scores showed no significant differences among the three groups, nor were beneficial effects observed on any of the BPRS subfactor scores that assess positive symptoms. Plasma alprazolam levels were maintained throughout the study and ranged from 20 to 100 ng/mL.

The addition of alprazolam was associated with significant, albeit modest, reductions in global psychosis, thought disorder, and paranoia ratings, with a return to pretreatment levels on discontinuation of alprazolam treatment. Improvement in \"negative symptoms\" such as emotional withdrawal paralleled the changes in \"positive symptoms\" but did not, in itself, reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in group mean plasma levels of homovanillic acid or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol during alprazolam treatment, although group mean serum cortisol levels were significantly decreased by alprazolam treatment. Patients who responded favorably to alprazolam treatment were significantly more psychotic or anxious before treatment, were older, showed significant alprazolam-associated reductions in plasma levels of homovanillic acid, and had significantly more prominent prefrontal cortex atrophy on computed tomographic scans than patients in whom alprazolam was without therapeutic effect. These preliminary data, based on a small sample, suggest that some patients with schizophrenia who are only partially responsive to standard neuroleptic treatment may benefit from the addition of triazolobenzodiazepines, such as alprazolam.\r"

Solitary condylomatous papillomas of the bronchus should be distinguished from solitary bronchial squamous papillomas that do not have condylomatous features.

The 47 male and 56 female patients had a median age of 56 years (range, 17 to 83 years). Computed tomography (CT) was used to localize the needle in 90 cases, and ultrasonography was used in the remaining 24 cases. The predominant sites aspirated were the liver (n = 40), pancreas (n = 23), and pelvis (n = 14). Seventy-eight of the 113 patients had a malignant neoplasm. Fine-needle aspiration cytology correctly identified 63 (88%) of the 78 cases. There were no false-positive studies. Computed tomography and UTZ ultrasonography were equally sensitive in detecting malignant neoplasms. In 38 patients with a history of previously treated malignant neoplasm, percutaneous aspiration cytology confirmed the presence of recurrent disease in 24 (75%) of 32 patients. Results of aspiration cytology obviated the need for a diagnostic laparotomy in 51 (65%) of the 78 patients with a malignant neoplasm. There was no serious morbidity or mortality associated with the procedure. We conclude that CT/ultrasonography-directed percutaneous FNA cytology is the procedure of choice in the workup of patients with intra-abdominal masses. The specificity is 100% and sensitivity is 90%. It is particularly useful in patients with extensive disease that would not be palliated by operation.\r"

Selective arteriography has long remained the gold standard for this purpose, but its use has been met with variable success. Despite various attempts at localization, insulinomas remain undetected in 10% to 20% of patients, and there may be a postoperative complication rate of at least 10% to 25%. To review the results and surgical implications of current localization techniques, 36 adult patients who were surgically treated for insulinomas at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, from July 1982 through June 1987 were studied. The sensitivities of tumor localization using arteriography, computed tomography, and preoperative and intraoperative ultrasonography were 53%, 36%, 59%, and 90%, respectively. A subset of 29 patients underwent intraoperative ultrasonography, and all of these patients' insulinomas were identified with a combination of this technique and intraoperative palpation, with nonpalpable tumors being imaged in four patients. In 18 patients (62%), information obtained from the images appeared to influence the surgical management. While there is no substitute for exploration by an experienced surgeon, exploration appears to be enhanced by the addition of intraoperative ultrasonography, particularly during reoperation.\r"

The midface degloving approach was limited to patients with septal perforations greater than 3 cm and failed prior attempts at surgical closure. Bilateral posteriorly based unipedicled flaps were utilized in the septal closure. Complete closure was accomplished in 75% (18/24) of cases, with a follow-up of one to three years. Complications included reperforation in 25% (6/24) of cases and partial vestibular stenosis in 20% (5/24) of cases. A modification of our technique, relining the nasal floor with postauricular full-thickness skin grafts, has alleviated vestibular stenosis.\r"

Nine patients of the 102 in the study developed otorrhea in the first two postoperative weeks. All nine were in the control group of 46. The 56 patients receiving prophylactic gentamicin had no cases of purulent otorrhea. Several other characteristics of the patients and the procedures were examined as possible risk factors for otorrhea. None were statistically significant, but the younger patients had a higher rate of infection. We recognize the theoretical risk of ototoxicity, but conclude that instillation of topical gentamicin is an effective prophylactic technique for preventing purulent otorrhea after tympanostomy.\r"

No abnormal karyotypes were found. Amniotic fluid was successfully obtained from both amniotic sacs in 77 patients. In two pregnancies elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were found in both sacs. One of these pregnancies was terminated and the other continued until term. One pregnancy miscarried 4 weeks after amniocentesis at 19 weeks gestation; three women were delivered between 23 and 28 weeks, 36 at between 28 and 37 weeks and 42 women after 37 weeks. The perinatal mortality rate was 55/1000 (9 of 164). These results show that genetic amniocentesis is a safe and reliable technique in twin pregnancy but the interpretation of elevated AFP levels is complicated by the fact that AFP diffuses across the amniotic membranes between the two sacs.\r"

The median level for the affected pregnancies was 73% of that in the controls. Low unconjugated oestriol levels can be used to detect fetal Down's syndrome; at cut-off levels selected to detect at least 35% of affected pregnancies, unconjugated serum oestriol was a better screening test than either maternal age or serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The use of all three variables in combination to select women with a 1:250 or greater risk of a Down's syndrome term pregnancy would yield a 45% detection rate with a false-positive rate of 5.2%. The same detection rate using maternal age alone or using age and serum AFP in combination would yield higher false-positive rates, 15% and 9.8% respectively. The addition of unconjugated oestriol to a Down's syndrome screening programme would therefore be more efficient than the use of age and AFP alone; for a given detection rate fewer women would need an amniocentesis or, for a given percentage of women having an amniocentesis, more pregnancies with Down's syndrome would be detected.\r"

The preference for terodiline to placebo was statistically significant: 14/3 women (P less than 0.05), and the majority of women (12/4) preferred terodiline to emepronium. Terodiline also gave a small but significant reduction in 24 h micturition frequency and eliminated detrusor instability in almost 50% of the patients (P less than 0.05).

Thirteen patients had a complete response to treatment, while partial and stable responses were achieved in 20 and 39 patients respectively (total objective response rate of 34.5%). The mean duration of response was 24 months. In the non-responders the median survival was 8.1 months with a 17% probability of survival at 2 years; the probabilities of survival at 2 years of the patients who showed partial and stable responses were 87 and 67% respectively.

Ultrasound examinations were efficient in discriminating between normal and pathological findings. Extra-testicular lesions were readily differentiated from testicular ones. Although both clinical and ultrasonographic examinations had high sensitivity (90%) in detecting testicular cancer, the number of false positive findings was smaller after ultrasound examination. This gave a predictive value of a positive test of 53% after ultrasound examination but only 33% after clinical examination. Ultrasound examination may, therefore, reduce the number of surgical explorations in the scrotum and should be performed in patients with suspected testicular pathology based on history and palpatory findings.\r"

(1) The disease can now be defined as a myopathy due to mutation at Xp21, a specific locus on the short arm of the X chromosome. (2) As a consequence of that discovery, any myopathy due to mutation at Xp21 should be a variant of DMD and should affect the same gene product. Moreover, any myopathy due to mutation at a location other than Xp21 should affect some other gene product. (3) For these reasons, DNA analysis is now needed for clinical diagnosis of muscle disease. (4) Xp21 myopathies may be mild or severe, may occur in females even though X-linked, and may be manifest only by high serum levels of creatine kinase. (5) Mental retardation is not consistently related to diseases that are encoded at Xp21. The association of mental retardation with DMD may be due to mutation in a separate gene near that for DMD. Concepts may soon be altered again as we learn about the affected gene product (dystrophin) and its role in these diseases.\r"

Biliary atresia in children and nonalcoholic cirrhosis in adults are the most common indications for the procedure. Transplantation currently plays only a minor role in the treatment of hepatic malignant disease. Blood group compatibility between donor and recipient is preferred, but histocompatibility matching (tissue typing) currently has no significant role in the selection of recipients. Approximately 70% of recipients survive for 1 year, and these patients have an excellent prospect of long-term survival. The emerging evidence indicates that the quality of life and rehabilitation of most liver recipients are good. The current success of liver transplantation can be attributed to critical selection of recipients, modern anesthetic and surgical techniques, improved perioperative care, accurate diagnosis of rejection and superior immunosuppression with cyclosporine.\r"

The role of multiple low level pollutants on healthy workers must be assessed in an objective fashion. Methods to evaluate and enforce regulations on building ventilation should be developed and widely applied. It is only in this fashion that an expanding population of office workers can be assured a suitable work environment as we emerge from the age of the industrial blue collar worker to the technical, office-based white collar worker.\r"

When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation, this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant cancers including malignant glioma. In six of eight patients (75%) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma, sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred. This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose etoposide therapy. Significant clinical manifestations have included confusion, papilledema, somnolence, exacerbation of motor deficits, and sharp increase in seizure activity. These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy. In all patients, computerized tomographic (CT) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans. This complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma.\r"

Thorotrast-laden histiocytes and free Thorotrast material were found in both components of the tumor. An overlying, adherent dural cranial lesion was found to contain massive deposits of Thorotrast embedded in a dense fibrotic and sclerotic stroma with focal calcification. These features are typical of \"Thorotrastoma.\" Thorotrast stains greenish-brown with hematoxylin and eosin and appears as refractile granular particles of relatively uniform size either within histiocytes or as free material. The radioactivity of the deposits was confirmed through the use of a scintillation counter, and 232 thorium was definitively identified though the use of scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Immunohistochemical studies of the tumor demonstrated glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in areas of glioma and focal vimentin and actin immunoreactivity in areas of sarcoma. Thorotrast-associated lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) are infrequently reported, and a Thorotrast-associated gliosarcoma has not yet been reported. The use of Thorotrast, its radiobiology, and sequelae are reviewed with particular emphasis on lesions occurring in the CNS.\r"

The cutoff values of the complements were set according to retrospective study including 17 LC patients and 20 HCC patients. The values with highest accuracy, 75 mg/dl C3, 16 mg/dl C4, and 18 mg/dl C3PA, were selected.

Five patients treated with regimens EE-4 or K-4, regimens that included single-dose dactinomycin and no abdominal irradiation, experienced severe hepatic toxicity. The clinical courses of these patients suggested that multiple factors, including the administration of other hepatotoxic agents, contributed to the toxicity observed. The study has been modified by decreasing the dose of dactinomycin from 60 micrograms/kg to 45 micrograms/kg. Further evaluation of other potential contributing factors, such as the use of halogenated hydrocarbon inhalational anesthetic agents, is needed.\r"

We successfully derived several low-passage cell lines of human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from head and neck tumors using an in vitro adaptation procedure, characterized these lines, and examined them for expression of a 44-kilodalton (kD) polypeptide (PP) oncofetal antigen (OFA) at the cell surface. Newly established an in vitro-passaged SCC cells retained characteristic microvilli, numerous desmosomes and tonofilaments, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, osmophilic keratohyaline granules, and other features of the primary SCC cells. These new cell lines and two long-term, established SCC lines (FaDu and Detroit 562) displayed OFA at the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 115. While the FaDu and Detroit 562 lines exhibited aneuploidy during flow cytometric analysis, the new, low-passage SCC lines that we developed remained diploid as were the primary SCC cells from which they were derived. We propose that the expression of a 44-kD OFA is a common feature of human SCC. This marker may prove useful in the detection and treatment of these tumors.\r"

These results indicate that thrombin is generated in situ in this tumor type. Based on previous evidence for the existence of an initiator of coagulation together with coagulation factor intermediates associated with viable SCCL tumor cells in situ, and also for the favorable effects of anticoagulant therapy with warfarin in SCCL, we postulate that local tumor cell-induced thrombin formation may contribute to self-regulated progression of SCCL through deposition of fibrin and stimulation of cell proliferation. These results suggest novel treatment strategies for this particular tumor type and justify efforts to identify other tumor types in which similar mechanisms exist.\r"

Sections of the neoplasms were stained immunohistologically for the following thyroid associated antigens: (1) thyroglobulin, which shows a positive reaction with follicular cells of the thyroid; (2) calcitonin, which is positive in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid; and (3) leucocyte common antigen (LC), which identifies lymphomata and Factor VIII-related antigen for hemangioendothelioma. Using these methods, five cases were reclassified. Three cases were identified as lymphomata, one case was reclassified as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, and one case was identified as hemangioendothelioma. Eleven cases were confirmed to be anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid and ten cases were negative for all the antigens tested. There was a significant difference in the survival of the groups of patients mentioned above. Prognostic data support the suggestion that immunohistochemical methods should be used for the precise classification of anaplastic carcinoma. In this way, tumors such as malignant lymphoma and medullary carcinoma, which resemble anaplastic carcinoma histologically but have a better prognosis, can be identified. This is important for planning surgical procedures and choosing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.\r"

Agreement was better in Series 1 because it included fresher, previously untouched specimens. There were 70 patients in Series 1 with known clinical endocrine response. A negative assay correlated with disease progression in 45 of 57 patients, significantly better than with biochemistry (P = 0.013). In comparing 39 women with rapid disease progression with 39 free of disease at 5.1 years, those with PgR-ICA-positive tumors were over four times more likely to remain disease-free than those with negative results (P = 0.007). Product moment life-table analysis of 79 patients from Series 2 showed a significantly better cumulative survival for those with PgR-ICA-positive tumors (P = 0.047).

The remaining problems technically are those of earlier reperfusion, methods to enhance myocardial recovery after ischemia, and prevention of restenosis or reocclusion. The use of laser methodology, coronary sinus retroperfusion, partial left heart bypass, and other innovative strategies may improve these results. The introduction of tissue plasminogen activator will affect our approach and will profoundly alter society's expectations of therapeutic success. Still, patients will die from acute myocardial infarction and its complications. The search for a prevention must, therefore, not be overshadowed by our current enthusiasm for reperfusion techniques. Hopefully, our current approach will become a historical footnote as breakthroughs in preventive strategies occur.\r"

Sixty women were randomized into two groups, A (continuous) and B (intermittent). Twenty-eight patients in Group A and 29 in Group B completed the study. We compared the groups with regard to satisfaction with pain relief for both labour and delivery as measured by a Visual Analogue Scale on five occasions during and after parturition. There was no difference between groups at any of the five stages. The difference in pain scores before the epidural and after the epidural was significant for both groups (p less than 0.001). The incidence of missed segments, degrees of motor block, height of sensory block, length of labour and fetal outcome were similar in both groups. Plasma bupivacaine levels were measured in six patients in each group. Mothers in Group A received more drug than those in Group B (p less than 0.01) but plasma bupivacaine levels remained low in the mother and the umbilical cord samples in the sub-set from this group. More women in Group A required outlet forceps (p less than 0.05) whereas mid-forceps and Caesarean section rates were similar in the two groups. Fewer mothers in the infusion group had spontaneous vaginal delivery. We conclude that infusion techniques are as effective as intermittent top-up epidurals and are well received by mothers in labour.\r"

Both groups were similar in respect to age, height, weight, duration and outcome of labour, birthweight and neonatal Apgar scores. Patients in Group A (PCEA) received significantly less local anaesthetic than those in Group B (11.2 vs 15.2 mg.hr-1). Pain relief was similar in both groups. Patients expressed overall satisfaction with PCEA, appreciating control over their own pain relief and less reliance on medical staff.

Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1-2 per cent in a mixture of nitrous oxide 60 per cent and oxygen 40 per cent. No supplemental doses of fentanyl or atracurium were given. Intubation conditions were satisfactory for all patients in both groups. There was no significant difference in intubation score between the two groups. The incidence of myalgia was 76 per cent in the succinylcholine group compared to 23 per cent in the atracurium group (p less than 0.005). Fifty per cent of the patients in the succinylcholine group had myalgia necessitating bed rest or analgesics compared to 23 per cent in the atracurium group (p less than 0.05).

Immunosuppression was maintained with azathioprine 100 mg daily, cyclosporine 300 mg daily and prednisone 10 mg daily. The patient had chronic hypertension controlled with nifedipine 40 mg daily and furosemide 20 mg daily. The cyclosporine level taken on the morning of surgery was 166 micrograms.L-1. Induction of anaesthesia consisted of fentanyl 350 micrograms, thiopentone 125 mg and pancuronium 5.5 mg. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 70 per cent in oxygen and isoflurane 0.5-1.5 per cent. No additional doses of pancuronium were given during the four hour surgical procedure. At the end of surgery, four twitches were present with train-of-four stimulation, but evidence of residual muscle paralysis was present. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg. Residual paralysis was present in the Recovery Room and edrophonium 10 mg was given prior to extubation. Clinical testing demonstrated adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Twenty minutes following extubation, increasing respiratory distress was noted. There was clinical evidence of muscle paralysis. The patient was re-intubated. It is proposed that cyclosporine potentiated the pancuronium blockade producing prolonged neuromuscular relaxation resulting in residual paralysis following surgery. The potential interactions of cyclosporine and muscle relaxants deserve further study.\r"

  ".W": "Renal failure and chronic haemodialysis are often associated with alterations in fluid status and plasma proteins. These changes, in turn, may result in pharmacokinetic alterations in affected patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in chronic renal failure patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Ten male patients were studied. Following induction of anaesthesia each patient received sufentanil 2.0 micrograms.kg-1 IV with subsequent serial plasma sampling for drug measurement from one to 360 minutes. A biexponential equation provided the best fit of the sufentanil concentration data with mean +/- SEM distribution (alpha) and elimination (beta) half-lives of 2.9 +/- 1.3 and 176 +/- 87 minutes, respectively. The mean Vc and Vd beta values were 0.15 +/- 0.05 L.kg-1 and 0.85 +/- 0.16 L.kg-1, respectively; plasma drug clearance was 11.5 +/- 3.7 ml.kg-1.min-1. Mean values for K10, K12 and K21 were 0.15 +/- 0.06.min-1, 0.4 +/- 0.14.min-1 and 0.1 +/- 0.04.min-1, respectively. With the exception of Vd beta, these pharmacokinetic values are similar to those reported in previous studies in general surgical, elderly and burn patients. The Vd beta values observed in this study may have resulted from alterations in drug distribution or elimination following revascularization of the implanted kidneys. Nevertheless, it appears that modification of sufentanil doses is unnecessary in chronic renal failure patients undergoing renal transplantation.\r"

Clinicians should not take isolated experimental studies and jump to conclusions about clinical use of anaesthetics. Experimenters should not arrive at sweeping conclusions based on a particular experimental study performed under some or other carefully or not so carefully controlled conditions. Editorialists, such as Becker in a recent issue of Anesthesiology, should not conclude that an anaesthetic is \"dangerous,\" based on these kinds of studies. It is especially invalid to use the term \"dangerous\" unless the author is willing to present us with a viable, experimentally proven, safer alternative. To tell us that isoflurane is \"dangerous\" implies that we should switch to some unspecified other agent. What conclusions can be arrived at based on these studies? (1) It is possible to produce coronary steal, in dogs, at constant coronary flow, with isoflurane at 41 mmHg perfusion pressure. The comparison between halothane and isoflurane is suspect because is was performed at two markedly different coronary perfusion pressures. (2) Myocardial ischaemia can be induced in humans with coronary artery disease when hypotension and tachycardia is permitted during isoflurane anaesthesia. During these conditions, relative preservation of coronary blood flow greater than that which would be expected because of measured or calculated demand has been interpreted as meaning that the mechanism was that of coronary steal. I am not convinced that this mechanism needs to be invoked here, but we can conclude from these studies that if hypotension and tachycardia are allowed to occur in patients with coronary artery disease, ischaemia is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 11.7 mM glucose, insulin, and potassium (GIK) on metabolism during ischemia were investigated in the perfused guinea pig heart using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Intracellular metabolites, primarily glycogen and glutamate, were labeled with 13C by addition of [1-13C]glucose to the perfusate during a normoxic, preischemic period. 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the metabolism of 13C-labeled metabolites simultaneously with high-energy phosphorus metabolites and pH. The extent of acidosis and the rate and amount of labeled lactate accumulation during ischemia were the same in control (3 mM glucose + insulin) and GIK-treated hearts. In contrast, the rate of labeled glycogen mobilization during ischemia in GIK-treated hearts was one third the rate observed in control hearts. These observations suggest that GIK decreased the rate of glycogenolysis during ischemia without affecting the rate of glycolysis. We propose that glucose contributed as a glycolytic substrate to a greater extent during ischemia in GIK-treated hearts than in hearts perfused with 3 mM glucose and insulin. The glycogen-sparing effect of GIK demonstrated in these studies could delay the onset of ischemic damage in a clinical setting by prolonging the availability of glycolytic substrate necessary for production of high-energy phosphate.\r"

Platelet aggregability, which may play a role in the cause of these disorders, has been observed to increase after the normal morning activities of awakening, arising, and ambulating. To determine which morning activity or activities are responsible for this aggregability increase, we measured platelet aggregation in 16 normal subjects on a control day of delayed arising (i.e., subjects remained supine until 12:30 PM) and on a day in which normal morning activities were divided into three isolated components of awakening (8 AM), assumption of upright posture (9:30 AM), and ambulating (11 AM). Blood samples to assess platelet aggregability were drawn at 8 AM before activity and 90 minutes after the initiation of each activity (i.e., at 9:30 AM, 11 AM, and 12:30 PM). For the group, in vitro platelet responsiveness to adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine increased only after assumption of the upright posture. The lowest concentration of agonist required to produce biphasic platelet aggregation decreased (aggregability increased) between 9:30 and 11 AM (90 minutes after assumption of the upright posture) from 3.3 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.2 microM for adenosine diphosphate (p less than 0.05) and from 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 1.0 +/- 0.4 microM for epinephrine (p less than 0.05). During the same interval, plasma epinephrine increased from 34 +/- 7 to 55 +/- 9 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and plasma norepinephrine increased from 169 +/- 19 to 298 +/- 25 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). There was no significant change in aggregability or catecholamine concentrations on the control day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Consequently, we performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial using hydralazine in 80 minimally symptomatic patients who had clinically stable, moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency. Patients randomized to hydralazine displayed a progressive reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) measured by radionuclide angiography, the predetermined end point of the study. At 24 months, mean LVEDVI had been reduced by 30 +/- 38 ml/m2, an 18% reduction from baseline. In contrast, LVEDVI changed minimally in patients randomized to placebo, and the intergroup differences over time were statistically significant (p less than 0.03). The hydralazine group also experienced reductions in left ventricular end-systolic volume index and increases in ejection fraction that were significantly different (both p less than 0.01) from changes in placebo-treated patients. These findings show that long-term treatment with hydralazine reduces the volume overload in aortic insufficiency and suggest that such therapy may have a beneficial effect on the natural history of the disease.\r"

No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. After 8 weeks, 73% and 69% of the patients in each respective group showed recompensation of renal function; serum creatinine fell from initially 7.0 and 6.2 mg/dl mean to 2.7 and 2.3 mg/dl mean, and under continued immunosuppression did not rise in the following months.

Bone loss in the vicinity of implants has hitherto been explained as being induced by mechanical unloading of the bone (stress protection). Experiments in sheep, dogs, and rabbits combining intravital staining of blood circulation and polychrome fluorescent labeling of bone remodeling leads to the conclusion that early bone porosis in the vicinity of the implants is the result of internal remodeling of cortical bone and is induced by necrosis rather than by unloading. This theory is favored by the evidence that (1) the bone porosis is of a temporary nature, an intermediate stage in internal bone remodeling; (2) the pattern of the remodeling zone is closely related to that of the disturbed circulation, and not to that of unloading; (3) plastic plates may produce more porosis than steel plates; and (4) improved blood circulation using modified plates resulted in reduced porosis. The clinical relevance of these findings is related first to the temporary weakening of the bone, and second to the possibility of sequestration. Sequestration may be the result of intensified remodeling activity in the presence of inflammation or infection.\r"

There was a prolonged union time overall (163% of expected) and in both insulin and oral hypoglycemic-controlled diabetics (157% and 176% of expected). Displaced fractures showed a prolonged union time, while nondisplaced fractures healed in the normal time period (187% and 96% of expected). Fractures treated by open reduction had a more prolonged healing time than those treated by closed reduction (186% and 142% of expected), but this was primarily related to displacement. Sex and age had no effect on union time. The known effects of diabetes mellitus on bone and mineral metabolism in both experimental animals and humans may explain these prolonged union times.\r"

Interface shear strength was determined using a transcortical push-out model in dogs after periods of three, five, six, ten, and 32 weeks. Undecalcified histologic techniques with implants in situ were used to interpret differences in mechanical response. The HA-coated titanium alloy implants developed five to seven times the mean interface strength of the uncoated, beadblasted CP titanium implants. The mean values for interface shear strength increased up to 7.27 megaPascals (MPa) for the HA-coated implants after ten weeks of implantation, and the maximum mean value of interface shear strength for the uncoated CP titanium implants was 1.54 MPa. For both implant types there was a slight decrease in mean shear strength from the maximum value to that obtained after the longest implantation period (32 weeks). Histologic evaluations in all cases revealed mineralization of interface bone directly onto the HA-coated implant surface, with no fibrous tissue layer interposed between the bone and HA visible at the light microscopic level. The uncoated titanium implants had projections of bone to the implant surface with apparent direct bone-implant apposition observed in some locations. Measurements of the HA coating material made from histologic sections showed no evidence of significant HA resorption in vivo after periods of up to 32 weeks.\r"

Since mast cells are numerous within alveolar walls, release of inflammatory mediators (and possibly elastase) by cigarette smoking could contribute to alveolar injury in this disease. We therefore examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for the mast cell granule constituents histamine and tryptase. The results, while not conclusive, supported the possibility that cigarette smoking increases secretion of histamine releasing activity by alveolar macrophages with subsequent degranulation of local mast cells. Mast cell discharge of inflammatory mediators (including neutrophil chemotactic factors and perhaps the elastolytic protease) could then participate in the destruction of alveolar walls.\r"

All patients received percutaneous transthoracic aspiration under ultrasound guidance. Positive cytologic diagnosis was established in ten of the 11 patients (91 percent). Additional biopsies performed in seven patients under similar ultrasonic guidance also provided concordant results. No complications were observed in this series. This study has clearly shown that ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy can be a safe and useful means for obtaining materials for pathologic confirmation of Pancoast tumor. It may also assist in defining the tumor extension to pleura and adjacent structures.\r"

The hyperresponsiveness and \"bronchospasm\" are, in part at least, a consequence of the inflammation. Optimum patient care needs to focus on preventing inflammation when possible and using anti-inflammatory drugs when prevention is not possible. When chronic asthma is mild, aerosol glucocorticoids or cromolyn suffice. Acute exacerbations that do not respond fully to bronchodilator drugs usually should be treated by a course of oral glucocorticoids. A few patients with severe disease require oral glucocorticoid therapy indefinitely.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing evidence from case control surveys, population studies and allergen avoidance studies suggest inhalant allergy plays an important role in the etiology of asthma. Recent studies in hospital emergency rooms have compared the prevalence of serum IgE antibodies to common allergens (mite, cat, cockroach, rye grass and ragweed pollen) in patients admitted with acute asthma attacks and in unselected age-matched control subjects. These studies, carried out in central Virginia and northern California, showed a highly increased prevalence of IgE antibodies to inhaled allergens among asthmatic patients, and suggest that the development of allergen specific IgE antibody responses is a major risk factor for emergency room admission with asthma. Presentation at the emergency room appeared to be related to patients' exposure to specific allergens: in central Virginia, in the fall, dust mite was the predominant allergy, whereas in northern California, in May-June, most asthmatic patients (greater than 90 percent) were allergic to rye grass. New immunoassay technology, based on the use of monoclonl antibodies, has been developed to measure the quantities of \"indoor\" allergens (mite, cat, cockroach) in asthmatic patients' houses. It is now possible to propose tentative levels of mite allergens which should be considered both as a risk for IgE antibody sensitization (2micrograms allergen/g dust) and as a risk for acute asthma attacks (10micrograms allergen/g dust). Future management of asthma will require analysis of indoor allergens and the development of efficient allergen avoidance procedures. Further research is necessary to investigate the relationship between airborne allergen levels, particle size and the precipitation of asthma attacks and also to investigate immunologic mechanisms which may cause bronchial hyperreactivity.\r"

Chest roentgenograms and 133Xe scans were taken before and after smoke exposure. The DTPA clearance was more sensitive in detecting injury than either of these imaging techniques. The DTPA clearance rates increased in a dose responsive way following smoke inhalation: 2.4 percent and 12.1 percent excreted per minute for control animals and those exposed to five minutes of smoke, respectively. Seven patients in a clinical trial of DTPA following smoke exposure are described; their DTPA clearance rates were all normal, although five were active cigarette smokers. Despite encouraging results in animal experiments, DTPA clearance studies may be of little practical value in the clinical setting of acute inhalation injury.\r"

We found that those with an apnea index (AI) greater than 20 had a much greater mortality than those with AI = less than 20. The probability of cumulative eight-year survival was .96 +/- 0.02 (SE) for AI = less than 20 vs. 63 +/- 0.17 for AI greater than 20 (p less than .05). This difference in mortality related to AI was particularly true in the patients less than 50 years of age in whom mortality from other causes is not common. None of the patients treated with tracheostomy or nasal CPAP died. Eight of the patients treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) died and the cumulative survival of the UPPP-alone treated group was not different from the survival curve of untreated OSA patients with an apnea index of greater than 20. We conclude that OSA patients with an apnea index of greater than 20 have a greater mortality than those below 20 and that UPPP patients be restudied after therapy. If the latter patients are found not to have marked amelioration of their AI, then they should be treated by nasal CPAP or tracheostomy.\r"

During the control study at rest, in the same 45-min time interval, plasma glucose decreased from 146 +/- 31 to 128 +/- 31 mg/dl. In the exercise study, one patient began exercising while hypoglycemic, and another patient developed asymptomatic hypoglycemia during exercise.

Clinical parameters, including age, sex, baseline fasting serum glucose levels, duration of diabetes mellitus, duration of foot ulcers, presence of peripheral neuropathy or arterial insufficiency, and evidence of osteomyelitis as determined by radiographs and/or radionuclide scans, were comparable in both groups of patients. No statistical differences (Student's t test) were seen in the number of microorganisms isolated from curettage cultures of the base of the ulcer at days 0, 7, and 14 of the study between groups 1 and 2. In contrast to previous studies, there was a paucity of anaerobic microorganisms isolated from these foot ulcers without associated gangrenous changes. Ulcer areas were estimated by multiplying the maximum width by the maximum length in millimeters at days 0, 7, and 14. Analysis of variance and Student's t test revealed progressive significant reductions in the ulcer areas in both groups when days 0, 7, and 14 were compared and in ulcer depths in both groups when days 0 and 14 were compared. However, such ulcer size changes did not differ statistically between the control and THO groups. A trend toward slower healing was observed in the THO group. Healing of diabetic foot ulcers was not accelerated by THO in this study.\r"

Such interaction has been less highly developed in the field of diabetes. I present an epidemiological perspective on certain problems in type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes research and point out some potentially useful directions for future interdisciplinary efforts involving both basic and clinical scientists and epidemiologists. Early research on diabetes has been marred by variable case definitions. The demonstration in numerous epidemiological studies that plasma glucose has a bimodal distribution in populations has contributed to the widely accepted National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) and the nearly identical World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of diabetes. This development has markedly ameliorated many of the difficulties resulting from variable case definitions. Appreciation of the phenomenon of bimodality has also contributed to a better understanding of impaired glucose tolerance. Many studies on the pathogenesis of type II diabetes take the form of case-control (i.e., cross-sectional) studies. The weaknesses of this research design are well known to epidemiologists. Prospective studies, a much stronger research design for inferring causal relationships, are much less common in the field of diabetes than in the field of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Recently, however, two prospective studies have helped define the role of serum insulin levels and insulin resistance as diabetes risk factors. These studies were carried out in small, relatively isolated populations, and there is a great need to replicate these findings in larger, more representative populations and to further evaluate the relative role of insulin secretion and insulin resistance as diabetes risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these risk factors, plasma lipids and lipoproteins are the target for altered dietary habits, particularly regarding fat. Such an alteration must be qualified with an understanding of the relationship between diabetes mellitus and lipoprotein metabolism and evidence of a favorable outcome of a fat-modified diet on this relationship. In seeking a revision of the current dietary fat recommendations of the American Diabetes Association, we have addressed five major questions. Is the serum lipid or lipoprotein concentration in diabetes different from that of the nondiabetic population? Are the familial or genetic forms of hyperlipidemia coinherited and/or overrepresented in diabetic subjects? What is the mechanism of the lipid/lipoprotein disorder in diabetes, and to what extent could it be related to the diabetic metabolic milieu? What is the effect of antidiabetic treatment on plasma lipids and lipoprotein metabolism? What evidence is there that a modified-fat diet could exert favorable benefits over and above what could be achieved by optimal antidiabetic therapy? This article outlines the revised dietary fat recommendations of the American Diabetes Association Nutrition Task Force and their rationale.\r"

Achieving metabolic control and delaying and/or preventing diabetic complications have previously been established as primary goals for the dietary management of diabetes. Although the primary function of dietary protein is for growth and tissue maintenance, dietary protein may play a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism and in the development of diabetic renal complications. Approximately half of protein intake is considered to be available as glucose. Dietary composition also affects secretion of insulin and counterregulatory hormones. One-third of individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes and one-fifth of those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes develop nephropathy within 15 yr after the diagnosis of diabetes. High protein intake and hyperglycemia can increase the glomerular filtration rate and the work load of the kidney. There is growing evidence from clinical studies that the progression of renal disease is delayed by early protein restriction. More studies are needed to assess early risk of diabetic nephropathy and to determine whether protein restriction alters the course of diabetic nephropathy. A dietary intake of between 12 and 20% protein provides flexibility in food selection but exceeds actual needs. The adult Recommended Dietary Allowance of 0.8 g/kg body wt should provide guidance for determining desired protein intake for individuals with diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Current evidence suggests that high-fiber diets, especially of the soluble variety, and soluble fiber supplements may offer some improvement in carbohydrate metabolism, lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and have other beneficial effects in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Diets enriched with wheat bran and guar gum induce 10-20% reductions in serum cholesterol and LDL in both normo- and hypercholesterolemic subjects and have the ability to blunt the hypertriglyceridemic effects of diets high in carbohydrate and low in fiber. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) the situation is less clear, but a decrement of the circadian glucose profile has been shown. Americans, in general, consume too little fiber. With the need to restrict fat and reduce protein, an increase in carbohydrates is mandatory. A practical goal would be to establish the present level of fiber intake (15-30 g/day) and to gradually increase it. An intake of up to 40 g of fiber per day or 25 g/1000 kcal of food intake appears beneficial; in many individuals on weight-reducing diets higher levels may be unacceptable because of gastrointestinal side effects. The level of maximum benefit has not been determined. Fiber supplementation appears beneficial only if given with a diet comprising approximately half of the calories as carbohydrate. Foods should be selected with moderate to high amounts of dietary fiber from a wide variety of choices to include both soluble and insoluble types of fiber. Insufficient data are available on the long-term safety of high-fiber supplements. People at risk for deficiencies, such as postmenopausal women, the elderly, or growing children, may require supplements of calcium and trace minerals. People with upper gastrointestinal dysfunction are at risk of bezoar formation and cautioned against a diet high in fiber of the leafy vegetable type. Careful attention must be paid to insulin dose because hypoglycemia can result if there is a radical change in fiber intake and insulin dose is not reduced appropriately. Care must be exercised in the use of \"novel\" fibers, including the wood celluloses, because little is known of their safety and efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Individuals with an upper-body form of obesity show greater associations with higher glucose excursions, exacerbated insulin resistance, increased abnormality of lipoprotein profile, and higher cardiovascular risk. Individuals with obesity and diabetes are at great risk for cardiovascular disease. Weight reduction and improvement in blood glucose control through dietary interventions for the obese person with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) hold the greatest potential for reducing morbidity and mortality. The relative merits of different weight-reduction programs are unclear, but regimens should be nutritionally complete, easy to follow, and include a program for maintaining the reduced weight level. Improvement in insulin action and the possibility of slowing development of clinical nephropathy or end-stage renal disease in NIDDM through weight loss have been found. Very low calorie diets, when used with medical supervision, may lead to significant weight loss, improved metabolic status, and even reduction or elimination of the need for oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin; however, further studies are needed to examine possible negative outcomes in people with NIDDM before very low calorie diets can be recommended. The causes of obesity and its connection with diabetes are unclear, but even modest calorie restriction may be beneficial to obese diabetic patients because of the positive effects on blood glucose levels and requirements for insulin and oral antidiabetic agents.\r"

To teach patients about diet, educators must use educational techniques appropriate to culture and literacy of the patient and family. Single-concept messages such as \"eat less fat\" or \"eat less food\" promote learning and minimize failure. Nutrition information can be divided into sequenced manageable steps that can then be individualized to the patient's setting. No single set of exchange lists will suffice for all minority groups, nor are exchange lists themselves appropriate for all situations. To meet the needs of minority patients, nutrition educators must use a variety of tools and techniques relating to the foods of a particular ethnic group. Sound education strategies and simplified materials for NIDDM patients should also be employed.\r"

Consistency, timing, composition, and caloric content of food intake and physical activity, age, sex, growth, and pubertal status alter meal-plan needs. Self-monitoring of blood glucose should be used to individualize the meal plan. The general American Diabetes Association recommendations suggest that 50-65% of total calories be from carbohydrates from foods with a lower glycemic index and/or high fiber content. Protein should contribute 12-20% of total calories and fat less than 30%, with less than 10% saturated fat and less than 300 mg/day cholesterol. More severe fat restriction should be considered in individuals with persistent lipid abnormalities when compared with sex- and age-adjusted values. Calories should be sufficient for growth and development, with growth data obtained several times a year and plotted on standardized weight, height, and velocity charts. Blood pressure should be similarly plotted on age- and sex-standardized curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88254453\r", 
  ".W": "As more is understood about the physiology of exercise, in both normal and diabetic subjects, its role in the treatment of diabetes is becoming better defined. Whereas people with diabetes may derive many benefits from regular physical exercise, there are also several hazards that make exercise difficult to manage. In type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes, there are risks of hypoglycemia during or after exercise or of worsening metabolic control if insulin deficiency is present. Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients treated with sulfonylureas are also at some increased risk of developing hypoglycemia during or after exercise, although this poses less of a problem than with insulin treatment. In individuals treated by diet alone, regulation of blood glucose during exercise is usually not a significant problem and exercise can be used as an adjunct to diet to achieve weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. When obese type II diabetic patients are treated with very low calorie diets, adequate amounts of carbohydrate must be provided to ensure maintenance of normal muscle glycogen content, particularly if individuals wish to participate in high-intensity exercise that places a heavy workload on specific muscle groups. On the other hand, moderate-intensity exercise such as vigorous walking can be tolerated by individuals on very low calorie, carbohydrate-restricted diets after an appropriate period of adaptation. A number of strategies can be employed to avoid hypoglycemia in type I diabetic patients, and both type I and II diabetic patients should be examined carefully for long-term complications of their disease, which may be made worse by exercise. These considerations have led many diabetologists to consider exercise beneficial in the management of diabetes for some individuals but not recommended for everyone as a necessary part of diabetes treatment as in the past. The goals should be to teach patients to incorporate exercise into their daily lives if they wish and to develop strategies to avoid the complications of exercise. The rationale for the use of exercise as part of the treatment program in type II diabetes is much more clear than for type I diabetes; regular exercise may be prescribed as an adjunct to caloric restriction for weight reduction and as a means to improve insulin sensitivity in the obese insulin-resistant individual.\r"

  ".U": "88254614\r", 
  ".W": "RINm5F cells, a line derived from a rat insulinoma, are frequently used as a model for studying pancreatic B cell structure and function. These transformed cells are known, however, to be different from native B cells in a number of biochemical respects. We have now compared the surface features of RIN cells and native B cells in two different ways: 1) Dispersed cells from islet obtained from adult rats can reassociate spontaneously in culture to form aggregates (pseudoislets) with cellular organization similar to that of intact native islets (a central B cell core surrounded by a discontinuous mantle of non-B cells). Native islet cells and RIN cells were mixed together and allowed to reaggregate. Examination by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy showed that the aggregates contained all cell types present in the original mixed cell suspension (native B- and non-B cells, and RIN cells). The native B cells were centrally located, surrounded by zones of non-B cells, as in islets. The RIN cells, however, were restricted to the periphery and as such not recognized as native B cells. 2) R2D6, a monoclonal antibody, binds selectively to a ganglioside on the surface of islet B, but not non-B, cells. The role of this ganglioside is not known. RIN cells were incubated with R2D6 followed by a fluorescently labeled second antibody. Analysis by flow cytofluorometry indicated that the monoclonal antibody had bound (stained) only 3-15% of the RIN cells. These R2D6 positive cells were sorted from R2D6 negative cells and subsequently shown to have a lower DNA content. Expression of the R2D6 target ganglioside on RIN cells thus appears to be cell cycle dependent. Based on two different criteria, RINm5F cells do not therefore share surface features in common with native B cells. The cell cycle dependent expression of a B cell surface antigen by the RIN cells might, however, be a useful model for studying the regulation of ganglioside turnover.\r"

Specific insulin binding to crude membranes prepared from livers was 2.8% (per mg protein) in fatty animals compared with 7.9% in homozygous lean (Fa,Fa) and 9.0% in heterozygous lean (Fa,fa) animals. Insulin binding increased in liver membranes from fatty animals after a 72-h fast to 6.4%. The reduced insulin binding in livers from fatty rats was associated with elevated insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase activity, which fell towards control values after the fast. The elevated tyrosine kinase activity was associated with an increased maximum velocity (Vmax) without a change in Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for its substrates, ATP and poly(Glu,Tyr)4:1. These findings suggest that, in adult fatty rats, insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase has increased intrinsic activity. Further, the effect of the prolonged fast on both insulin binding and kinase activity, suggest that in this model environmental factors, and not necessarily a genetic abnormality, may regulate liver insulin receptors and their kinase. Whether the inverse relationship of the kinase and insulin receptor number is the result of a compensatory mechanism remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "Acute exposure of 3T3-L1 undifferentiated fibroblasts to insulin or 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) produced a moderate but significant stimulation of hexose transport (100% stimulation). In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stimulation by insulin increased significantly (to 340%), while that by PDB remained at 130%. Total protein kinase C activity was 3-fold higher in 3T3-L1 fibroblast than adipocyte homogenates. PDB, but not insulin, induced migration of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the membrane, in both fibroblasts and adipocytes. Moreover, the hormone increased by 15% the protein kinase C activity of the cytosol. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, both insulin and PDB elicited a rapid (2 min lag) cytoplasmic alkalinization, measured with the fluorescent pH indicator bis-carboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein trapped in the cytoplasm. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PDB but not insulin elicited the cytoplasmic alkalinization. The alkalinization was prevented by amiloride or by replacing Na+ with either N-methylglucamine+ or K+. Stimulation of hexose transport by insulin or PDB was not affected by amiloride or Na+ substitution. It is concluded that: 1) Insulin and PDB have different effects on protein kinase C activity and subcellular distribution; 2) the responses of Na+/H+ exchange and hexose transport to insulin and PDB develop independently during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells; 3) stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and of hexose transport occur in parallel rather than in series in 3T3-L1 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that the inhibition of renin secretion by acute administration of vasopressin in conscious dogs results from a reflex reduction in renal nerve activity. In the present investigation, this hypothesis was tested by studying the effect of total baroreceptor denervation or selective low pressure baroreceptor denervation on the suppression of PRA by vasopressin in conscious, chronically prepared dogs. In eight sham-operated dogs, a 45-min infusion of vasopressin (2.0 ng/kg.min, iv) decreased PRA from 10.5 +/- 1.9 to 5.9 +/- 1.0 ng/ml.3 h (P less than 0.01). Mean arterial pressure did not change (110 +/- 10 to 107 +/- 7 mm Hg), but heart rate decreased from 84 +/- 9 to 69 +/- 8 beats/min (P less than 0.05). In contrast, vasopressin infusion failed to significantly decrease PRA in seven sinoaortic/cardiac denervated dogs (9.5 +/- 1.7 to 7.4 +/- 2.0 ng/ml.3 h), although decreases did occur in three of the dogs. Mean arterial pressure increased from 104 +/- 5 to 125 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), but heart rate did not change (112 +/- 4 to 107 +/- 5 beats/min). When renal perfusion pressure was maintained at the preinfusion level in three sinoaortic/cardiac denervated dogs, vasopressin infusion failed to decrease PRA (2.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml.3 h). In six cardiac denervated dogs, vasopressin infusion decreased PRA from 5.3 to 0.9 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 ng/ml.3 h (P less than 0.01). Results obtained with two lower doses of vasopressin (0.5 and 1.0 ng/kg.min) were generally similar to the responses observed during infusion at 2.0 ng/kg.min. Angiotensin II (5.0 ng/kg.min) suppressed PRA in all groups of dogs. These experiments demonstrate that the inhibition of renin secretion by acute administration of vasopressin in conscious dogs is prevented by total baroreceptor denervation, but not by denervation of the low pressure baroreceptors alone. These results suggest that the suppression of renin release by vasopressin is a reflex response resulting from activation of the high pressure baroreceptors.\r"

When cells were pretreated with phorbol esters to produce a deficiency in protein kinase-C, the ability of further phorbol ester addition to stimulate p33 mRNA accumulation was abolished. However, after pretreatment of H4 cells with phorbol esters, insulin still induced cellular p33 mRNA concentrations, but to a lesser degree. The primary effect of phorbol esters was to increase transcription of the p33 gene, and this was abolished after pretreatment with phorbol esters. In previous work, insulin was shown to stimulate p33 gene transcription, but this effect was insufficient to account for the level of insulin-induced p33 mRNA production. The transcriptional effect of insulin was further reduced by phorbol ester pretreatment. Insulin must, therefore, regulate p33 gene expression by at least two pathways, at least one of which may be modulated by protein kinase-C.\r"

We evaluated the effects of resection, systemic drainage, and autotransplantation of the canine pancreas on peripheral insulin levels and glucose disposal as measured by iv glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) and a steady state hyperglycemic challenge (clamp). Proximal pancreatectomy (PPx) with reduced beta-cell mass and intact portal drainage resulted in a modestly elevated fasting glucose level and increased integrated glucose response to IVGTT. Compared to preoperative normals, basal insulin was unchanged from preoperative controls; however, peak insulin and integrated insulin response to IVGTT were decreased in PPx animals. Splenocaval drainage or autotransplantation of the distal pancreas resulted in normalization of the severely altered insulin response and fasting glucose levels. K values were significantly reduced after all three procedures. Clamp studies confirmed the basal glucose and insulin findings of the IVGTT. During the clamp, PPx animals had peripheral insulin values approximately 50% of normal controls, while autotransplantation and splenocaval drainage animals had insulin values that approximate normal controls. All three postsurgical groups had blunted insulin levels during stable hyperglycemia. Glucose utilization rates were severely decreased in all three groups. Reduction of beta-cell mass with intact portal drainage resulted in reduced insulin response to glucose challenge by either IVGTT or clamp. Systemic drainage of this same reduced beta-cell mass resulted in peripheral insulin levels comparable to normal controls. Denervation (autotransplantation) had little additive effect. All three groups demonstrated severely decreased rates of glucose disappearance as measured by both IVGTT and clamp studies. Therefore, reduction in beta-cell mass, drained systemically or portally, results in altered glucose disposal regardless of the peripheral insulin levels.\r"

Two previous studies reported the presence of insulin mRNA in neural tissue, but related efforts to confirm and better localize the cellular origin of the hormone have yielded equivocal results. In the present study we have attempted to clarify this issue by employing both immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization on isolated enriched cultures of rabbit brain neurons and glia. Our data show that a subset (3-5%) of neurons is positively immunoreactive for insulin, but all of the glial cells are negative. The level of staining intensity can be increased by preincubating the neurons with monensin (a Na+ ionophore that prevents cell secretory activity), but not the fraction of positive cells. Similarly, in situ hybridization reveals the presence of mRNA in 3-5% of neurons, but no such signal is detected in glia. Thus, our data not only confirm previous reports of insulin in the central nervous system, but, more importantly, indicate that the synthesis of the hormone is local and apparently confined to a subset of neurons.\r"

By 60 minutes after the infusion of IGF-I was completed, the concentration of plasma oGH was comparable to control and pre-infusion values. In IGF-I infused fetuses, the mean concentration of insulin also decreased (p less than 0.02), whereas glucose levels remained unaltered. The results suggest that the lack of inhibitory feedback by the relatively low levels of circulating IGF-I is one factor in the hypersecretion of GH by the fetus.\r"

  ".W": "Luteal phase deficiency is an ovulatory dysfunction problem that is subtle but real. It may be the most common ovulatory problem in women. Luteal phase deficiency has been clearly demonstrated in the research setting (1) in spontaneous cycles, (2) when follicular maturation has been impeded, and (3) when luteotrophic influences have been suppressed. The diagnosis of LPD in the clinical setting remains problematic and controversial primarily because there is no practical diagnostic method that has been validated. This article has reviewed the methods that have been used to diagnose LPD. BBT charts are insensitive; these charts reliably diagnose LPD only when there are persistent short luteal phases. There is disagreement whether ovarian follicular size, as determined by ultrasonography, is decreased in LPD; however, ultrasonographic diagnosis of LPD would require daily scans through ovulation, which makes this approach impractical. Mild hyperprolactinemia is a probable cause of LPD in a minority of patients; a physician should obtain a PRL level in LPD women with the realization that there is considerable sampling variability. Determination of serum gonadotropin levels (LH or FSH or both) is not practical for the clinical diagnosis of LPD. Random serum P levels, whether single or multiple, are not helpful in the diagnosis of LPD in individual patients. The secretory pattern of P results in such wide confidence limits that P samples from individuals cannot be compared to normal in a useful manner. Most of the controversy about the diagnosis of LPD has centered around the use of individual serum P levels. The timed endometrial biopsy relies on the endometrium as a bioassay of P over time. The endometrial biopsy has not been carefully validated in terms of its sensitivity or accuracy for the diagnosis of LPD. However, it remains the best current method for the diagnosis of LPD when the standard guidelines for its use are followed. As opposed to the other tests for LPD, awareness of the usefulness of the biopsy has increased as we have learned more about CL physiology. No current research method for the diagnosis of LPD appears to be a practical method that could be applied in the clinical setting. Specific secretory proteins from the endometrium and methods to measure hormone secretion that circumvent the secretory pattern hold promise for improved methods to diagnose LPD in the future.\r"

The amounts of alpha 2M in peritoneal fluid (PF) from women with endometriosis and women with noninflammatory gynecologic conditions were analyzed by functional (trypsin binding) and immunologic assays. The most important finding of this study was that a significant amount of the alpha 2M in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis had been inactivated by an as yet undetermined mechanism. The concentration and total amount of immunologically reactive alpha 2M in the samples varied widely and was not significantly different between the groups. However, women with endometriosis had significantly lower amounts of functional alpha 2M than did women without endometriosis. There was no significant difference between functional and immunologic measurements of alpha 2M in samples from women without endometriosis. Women with endometriosis, however, had less functional than immunologically reactive alpha 2M. This discrepancy was not due to inactivation of alpha 2M by having previously bound proteinase. Alpha 2M-proteinase complexes can down-regulate macrophase functions. It is possible that decreased proteinase-binding ability of alpha 2M may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and associated infertility by decreasing negative feedback control of macrophage activities.\r"

Epi was infused at 0.3 (high dose) or 0.1 (low dose; healthy subjects) nmol.kg-1.min-1 i.v., resulting in arterial plasma Epi levels of approximately 6 and 2 nM, respectively. Saline was infused on a control day. Insulin absorption was measured as disappearance of radioactivity from the injection site and as appearance of plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI). Adipose tissue blood flow was measured with the 133Xe clearance technique. First-order disappearance rate constants of 125I from the thigh depot decreased approximately 40-50% during the high dose of Epi compared with control (P less than .001). The corresponding decrease from the abdominal depot was approximately 40% (P less than .001), whereas no significant change was found during the low Epi dose. IRI fell compared with control in all groups at the high Epi dose. The Epi-induced depression of insulin absorption occurred despite unaltered or even slightly increased subcutaneous blood flow. The results indicate that circulating Epi at levels seen during moderate physical stress depresses the absorption of soluble insulin from subcutaneous injection sites to an extent that might be important for glycemic control in IDDM patients. Furthermore, dissociation is found between changes in insulin absorption and subcutaneous blood flow during Epi infusion, suggesting that factors other than blood flow may also influence the absorption of subcutaneously injected insulin.\r"

There was considerable variation in fed plasma glucose concentration, with C3H/HeJ mice the most glucose tolerant (174 +/- 7 mg/dl) and C57BL/6J mice the least glucose tolerant (252 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than .0001 vs. C3H/HeJ mice). Glycosylated hemoglobin of C57BL/6J mice (4.0 +/- 0.06%) was also higher than that of C3H/HeJ mice (3.52 +/- 0.06%, P less than .0001). The fed plasma insulin concentration did not differ between these two strains. Glucose tolerance was further evaluated in overnight-fasted C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). Although fasting plasma glucose did not differ, the most remarkable difference in plasma glucose during IPGTT between C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice was noted at 30 min (489 +/- 29 vs. 227 +/- 20 mg/dl, P less than .001). To determine the number of genes involved in the phenotypic difference in glucose tolerance, C57BL/6J males were crossed with C3H/HeJ females (F1, C3H/HeJ X C57BL/6J), and the F1 hybrid females were backcrossed with C57BL/6J males (backcrossed, F1 X C57BL/6J). Plasma glucose after 30 min on IPGTT was 219 +/- 8 (n = 21), 456 +/- 18 (n = 23), and 292 +/- 13 (n = 23) mg/dl for C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, and F1 mice, respectively (P less than .001 for all comparisons).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the physiological significance of this observation, the cAMP PDE activity associated with liver Golgi fractions has been measured in genetically obese Zucker rats, which spontaneously develop hyperinsulinemia, in rats receiving a continuous infusion of insulin, and in rats treated with anti-insulin serum. In genetically obese Zucker rats, a significant increase in Golgi-associated cAMP PDE relative to age-matched lean animals occurred after 3 wk, coinciding with the development of hyperinsulinemia. This change was maximal at 5-8 wk and affected the light (Gl) and intermediate (Gi) Golgi fractions (100-110% increase) to a greater extent than the heavy (Gh) fraction (30% increase). After 7 wk, despite the further increase in insulinemia, the increase in Golgi-associated cAMP PDE became progressively less marked, and at 18 wk it was no longer detectable except in Gh, suggesting the development of a hepatic insulin resistance. Infusion of insulin through chronically implanted intracardiac catheters led to a 30-50% increase in Golgi-associated cAMP PDE, which occurred earlier in Gi (3 h) than in Gh (7 h) and persisted for greater than 96 h. Injection of anti-insulin serum led to a 30-50% decrease in Golgi-associated cAMP PDE, which occurred sequentially in Gl (5 min), Gi (15 min), and Gh (30 min) and affected predominantly Gl and Gh. These results suggest that the cAMP PDE associated with Golgi fractions is a physiological effector of plasma insulin in vivo.\r"

To assess hyperglycemic potentiation, acute insulin secretory responses (AIR) to 5 g i.v. arginine were measured at the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level after PG was clamped at approximately 250 mg/dl and after PG was clamped at a maximally potentiating level of 550-650 mg/dl. FPG levels were unaffected by PX (112 +/- 4 mg/dl pre-PX vs. 115 +/- 5 mg/dl 6 wk after PX, P NS). Similarly, basal insulin levels remained constant after PX (11 +/- 2 microU/ml pre-PX vs. 11 +/- 1 microU/ml 6 wk after PX, P NS). The AIR to 300 mg/kg i.v. glucose decreased slightly from 42 +/- 9 microU/ml pre-PX to 32 +/- 5 microU/ml 6 wk after PX (P NS), and thus the beta-cell loss was underestimated. In contrast, insulin responses to arginine declined markedly after PX. The AIR to arginine obtained at FPG levels declined from 23 +/- 3 microU/ml pre-PX to 13 +/- 2 microU/ml 6 wk after PX (P = .04). The AIR to arginine obtained at PG levels of approximately 250 mg/dl declined even more, from a pre-PX value of 56 +/- 7 microU/ml to 21 +/- 4 microU/ml 6 wk after PX (P = .02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for development of diabetes in the genetically inherited disease maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), we have investigated a pair of identical twins (19 yr old) from a MODY family. One twin had nondiabetic fasting plasma glucose values but impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), whereas the other suffered from frank diabetes (fasting plasma glucose 12.5 mM). Differences in insulin secretion pattern and/or insulin action between the twins is supposed to be responsible for development of hyperglycemia in MODY. On the other hand, identical defects in insulin secretion and action in the twins may point to the primary genetic defect in MODY. Therefore, our aim was to investigate insulin secretion and insulin action in the twins to find these differences and similarities. We found that fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide values were slightly increased in the twins, whereas the responses of insulin and C-peptide to oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and meals were similar in the twins and within normal range. The insulin responses to OGTT were, however, lower than expected from the glucose values, indicating a beta-cell defect. Despite elevated plasma insulin levels, basal hepatic glucose output (HGO) was normal in the IGT twin but increased by 75% in the diabetic twin. The maximally inhibitory effect of insulin on HGO, when estimated at euglycemia, was normal in the IGT twin but reduced by 60% in the diabetic twin. Furthermore, the maximal insulin-mediated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues was reduced by 40% in the diabetic twin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the contribution of this early deficiency to prandial hyperglycemia, exogenous intravenous insulin (1.8 U over 30 min) was delivered to eight NIDDM subjects in a profile designed to simulate the normal initial rise in insulin levels. The same dose of insulin was also administered 1) in the same profile but delayed by 30 min and 2) as a constant infusion over 180 min. Augmentation of the early insulin response caused a 33 +/- 4% reduction in the glycemic response to a mixed meal (P less than .005); the peak blood glucose increment above baseline was reduced by 1.4 mM (P less than .005) to an increment identical to nondiabetic subjects (3.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM), and blood glucose levels were still 0.9 mM lower after 180 min (P less than .05). In contrast, the delayed profile or constant infusion did not significantly alter the glycemic response to the meal. Early insulin augmentation resulted in elevated peripheral insulin levels initially (peak level 81 +/- 11 mU/L), but subsequent insulin and C-peptide levels were lower than in the control study (at 180 min after the meal, 22 +/- 5 vs. 33 +/- 8 mU/L, P less than .05, and 4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L, P less than .02, respectively).

Insulin was infused intraportally for 3 h at 5 mU.kg-1.min-1 in five animals, and glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis were measured by using a combination of tracer [( 3-3H]glucose and [U-14C]alanine) and hepatic arteriovenous difference techniques. In response to the elevated insulin level (263 +/- 39 microU/ml), plasma glucose level fell (41 +/- 3 mg/dl), and levels of the counterregulatory hormones glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol increased (91 +/- 29 to 271 +/- 55 pg/ml, 83 +/- 26 to 2356 +/- 632 pg/ml, 128 +/- 31 to 596 +/- 81 pg/ml, and 1.5 +/- 0.4 to 11.1 +/- 1.0 micrograms/dl, respectively; for all, P less than .05). Glucose production fell initially and then doubled (3.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .05) by 60 min. Net hepatic gluconeogenic precursor uptake increased approximately eightfold by the end of the hypoglycemic period. By the same time, the efficiency with which the liver converted the gluconeogenic precursors to glucose rose twofold. Five control experiments in which euglycemia was maintained by glucose infusion during insulin administration (5.0 mU.kg-1.min-1) provided baseline data. Glycogenolysis accounted for 69-88% of glucose production during the 1st h of hypoglycemia, whereas gluconeogenesis accounted for 48-88% of glucose production during the 3rd h of hypoglycemia. These data suggest that gluconeogenesis is the key process for the normal counterregulatory response to prolonged and marked hypoglycemia.\r"

Immunocytochemical studies in 4- and 6-wk STZ-D animals showed the appearance of intensely NPY-positive swollen cell bodies in the supraoptic nucleus and a subjective increase in NPY staining of medial hypothalamic nerve fibers. Central hypothalamic concentrations of three other peptides were significantly greater in STZ-D animals than those in control animals at single points (neurotensin, 1 day; calcitonin gene-related peptide, 2 wk; neurokinin, 4 wk). Hypothalamic concentrations of the other six peptides examined (bombesin, galanin, neuromedin B, substance P, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) did not differ significantly between STZ-D and control groups at any time. However, galanin immunostaining in the supraoptic and magnocellular paraventricular nuclei was strikingly concentrated in a reduced number of distended cell bodies. Hypothalamic peptide changes in STZ-D could be related to metabolic disturbance, changes in energy and water balance, altered pituitary function, or other factors. Persistently elevated concentrations of NPY, a very potent central stimulant of eating and drinking, may mediate the hyperphagia and polydipsia characteristic of STZ-D.\r"

  ".W": "Cephalic-phase insulin release (CPIR) and the changes in glucose turnover induced by saccharin ingestion were studied in freely moving lean and genetically obese fa/fa rats equipped with chronic catheters for blood sampling. Six-hour-fasted lean and obese rats were trained to drink 1 ml sodium saccharin (0.15%) or 1 ml glucose (70%), and blood samples were taken before and after the stimuli. As early as 1-1.5 min poststimulus, there was a significant increase in CPIR in lean and obese rats. The amplitude of the CPIR induced either by saccharin or by glucose in the obese rats was significantly higher than it was in the lean rats. The effect of saccharin ingestion on the hepatic glucose production (HGP) and the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) was studied in 6-h-fasted lean and obese rats, under non-steady-state conditions, according to a method previously validated. Saccharin ingestion produced a significant increase in HGP and Rd in lean and obese rats compared with basal values. The saccharin-induced increments in HGP and Rd were higher in the obese than in the lean animals. We conclude that saccharin (through taste) appears to elicit parasympathetic (insulin release) and sympathetic (HGP increase) reflexes in lean and obese rats. These taste-induced changes in plasma insulin and glucose turnover are exaggerated in the obese rats and may participate in obesity and in insulin resistance of the overall syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of insulin on platelet function, both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro investigation, we evaluated whether insulin affects platelet function at a physiological hormone concentration by incubating the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of fasting subjects with human regular insulin at the final concentration of 40 microU/ml for 30 min; we observed a significant reduction of platelet sensitivity to all the aggregating agents employed, i.e., ADP, platelet-activating factor (PAF), epinephrine, collagen, and Na+ arachidonate. To investigate whether the insulin effect on platelets is dose dependent, we incubated the PRP of fasting subjects with different concentrations of human regular insulin (40, 80, 120, and 160 microU/ml) for 5 min, and we observed that the insulin-induced reduction of platelet sensitivity to aggregating agents is a dose-dependent phenomenon. Furthermore, the comparison between the platelet responses after 5 and 30 min of incubation with insulin showed that the insulin effect on platelet aggregation is time dependent. The lack of specificity of its inhibiting activity suggests that insulin does not interfere with the initial binding of each aggregating agent at specific sites but does influence a common step of platelet aggregation. Our study rules out the possibility that insulin reduces platelet-function-modifying intraplatelet cAMP levels or thromboxane A2 production, because this hormone decreases the platelet concentrations of cAMP--a phenomenon that, per se, promotes platelet aggregation--and does not modify collagen or Na+ arachidonate--induced platelet production of thromboxane A2, measured by radioimmunoassay of its stable-metabolite thromboxane B2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Binding of GI to a specific receptor on circulating cells (erythrocytes and monocytes) was normal. We conclude that in vitro extensive glycosylation of insulin reduces its biological activity in vivo, as reflected by insulin-mediated glucose disposal, probably at a postreceptor level.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of bacitracin on the binding and processing of 125I-labeled insulin was studied in a proximal tubular epithelium-like opossum kidney cell line. This cultured cell line handles insulin in a manner comparable to the in vivo situation, which requires membrane binding, internalization, and intracellular degradation. The addition of bacitracin inhibited insulin degradation significantly and delayed the time of appearance of products in the medium (22 min) compared with control cells (14 min). Maximum total cell-associated radioactivity increased from 1.5 +/- 0.19% in the control cells to 2.5 +/- 0.17% in the treated cells. Separation of cell membrane from internalized radioactivity was achieved by acid washing and showed no change in membrane-bound radioactivity or rate of internalization, but a significant increase in intracellular radioactivity was noted. Gel-filtration chromatography revealed that this was due to an accumulation of chromatographically intact insulin. Accordingly, we conclude that bacitracin inhibits insulin degradation in cultured kidney cells by perturbing the intracellular processing of insulin, not by altering the binding or internalization of the hormone or by inhibiting the release of small degradation products. Because of the multiple actions of this agent, the exact site in these kidney cells at which intracellular degradation is inhibited remains to be established. However, in contrast to studies with lysosomes isolated from cells of other tissues, this study showed that when lysosomes isolated from rat renal cortex were exposed to bacitracin, insulin degradation was inhibited markedly (81%).\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the sulfonylurea tolbutamide to induce insulin output, increase phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, and modulate the insulin response to other agonists was assessed. At 200 microM, tolbutamide increased both insulin release and the efflux of 3H from [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets only in the presence of 5.5 or 7 mM glucose. When the glucose level was maintained at 2.75 mM, tolbutamide (200 microM) had no positive impact on either parameter. The calcium-influx inhibitor nitrendipine (200 nM) blocked the effects of 200 microM tolbutamide (with 7 mM glucose) on 3H efflux and insulin output. Prior exposure of islets to tolbutamide (200 microM) in the presence of 7 mM glucose amplified their subsequent insulin response to 10 mM glucose and 5 mM glyceraldehyde. The effect of 200 microM tolbutamide (with 7 mM glucose) was blocked by nitrendipine. Furthermore, the effect of 200 microM tolbutamide was not observed with 2.75 mM glucose; however, if the level of tolbutamide was increased to 1 mM, both PI hydrolysis and potentiated release to subsequent stimulation with 10 mM glucose were observed. Tolbutamide (200 microM with 7 mM glucose) stimulation for 20 min resulted in an increase in 3H efflux from [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets. Despite the rapid fall in insulin secretion, elevated rates of 3H efflux persisted long after the removal of the sulfonylurea from the medium. The duration of the 3H-efflux response paralleled the duration of potentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dogs were surgically instrumented under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia to measure hemodynamics and obtain blood samples for determinations of oxygen and glucose concentrations. Myocardial uptake of these substances was calculated as the product of the appropriate arterial-coronary sinus differences and circumflex blood flow. The response to insulin was determined with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. During insulin infusion, MGU increased from 3.12 +/- 0.8 to 9.20 +/- 1.8 mg/min (mean +/- SE). In contrast, insulin failed to increase MGU when 8-PTH was being infused into the circumflex artery. These results demonstrate that some degree of adenosine-receptor-mediated activity is required for insulin to stimulate myocardial glucose uptake. It is suggested that the presence of adenosine at its receptor may be an important factor during conditions in which myocardial insulin resistance may develop.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have identified a high-affinity receptor on the plasma membrane of the beta-cell that is specific for all of the sulfonylureas. The most potent second-generation drugs, glyburide and glipizide, bind to the receptor and trigger insulin release at nanomolar concentrations. The affinity to the receptor-ligand interaction of all sulfonylureas correlates with their potency as insulin secretagogues, further implicating receptor occupancy with signal transduction. These drugs also inhibit the electrical activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and K+ efflux through these channels. The channels are also closed by the metabolism of the major insulin secretagogues, glucose and the amino acids, which signal insulin release by increasing the ATP level or the [ATP]-to-[ADP] ratio on the cytoplasmic side of the channel. Based on the channel number and the amount of K+ current they pass, it is possible to calculate that these channels control the resting membrane potential of the beta-cell. Inactivation of the ATP-inhibitable K+ channel results in a fall in the resting membrane potential, cell depolarization, and influx of extracellular Ca2+ through the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. The rise in intracellular free Ca2+ level triggers exocytosis. Thus, it is now possible to link either a stimulus from the metabolism of insulin secretagogues or the sulfonylureas to ionic and electrical events that elicit insulin release. These data also suggest that the sulfonylurea receptor or a closely associated protein is an ATP-sensitive K+ channel.\r"

Three groups of anesthetized normal (n = 17) and three groups of STZ-D (n = 19) animals were studied. In each group, infusions were adjusted to expose rats to basal, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions. Final steady-state serum glucose and insulin concentrations (mean +/- SE) achieved in the six groups ranged from 112 +/- 2 to 467 +/- 26 mg/dl and from 5.8 +/- 1.9 to 3644 +/- 116 microU/ml, respectively. Intracellular free-glucose content of all tissue was calculated from total tissue glucose content minus the contribution of glucose in extracellular water estimated with [14C]inulin. Intracellular free glucose was not detected in muscle of any of the experimental groups. However, intracellular free glucose was detected in liver from all normal and STZ-D rats, and the calculated intracellular concentrations of free glucose correlated with serum glucose concentrations (r = .68, P less than .001). We conclude that intracellular free glucose does not accumulate, regardless of glucose or insulin concentration, in normal skeletal muscle and muscle made insulin resistant (by STZ-D), suggesting that glucose transport remains rate limiting.\r"

Before intensive therapy [hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) 9.6 +/- 1.1%], epinephrine responses were triggered at a higher plasma glucose level (67 +/- 4 mg/dl) than in normal control subjects (56 +/- 1 mg/dl, P less than .05), and clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia appeared at glucose levels of 50-60 mg/dl. After intensive therapy (HbA1 7.1 +/- 0.7%), the glucose threshold for epinephrine release consistently declined to values (46 +/- 2 mg/dl) below normal (P less than .01). Furthermore, epinephrine concentrations were markedly reduced at each hypoglycemic level, and a greater hypoglycemic stimulus was required to elicit symptoms. The glucose threshold stimulating release of growth hormone also significantly declined after intensive therapy. We conclude that strict glycemic control of IDDM lowers the plasma glucose level required to generate epinephrine release during hypoglycemia. This may diminish patient recognition of moderate hypoglycemia and increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia in intensively treated IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies have suggested that elevated lactogen, increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased beta-cell coupling are associated. To determine whether this association occurs under conditions of physiologically increased lactogen, we have studied the extent of dye coupling in rat islets during the later stage of pregnancy. These animals have high plasma lactogen levels in the form of placental lactogen, increased plasma insulin, and decreased plasma glucose. The fluorescent tracer, Lucifer yellow CH, was microinjected into central cells of islets from both pregnant and virgin rats, and the extent of transfer was quantitated by determining the projected area of dye spread. Two area measurements were made for each injection, one around the entire discernible fluorescent region (\"outer\") and another around the distinct brighter region of cells surrounding the injected cell (\"inner\"). Pregnancy increased dye transfer, as determined by both measurements. The outer area of dye transfer was 9047 +/- 775 microns2 for the islets from pregnant rats and 4699 +/- 391 microns2 for the islets from virgin rats (P less than .001). Similarly, pregnancy increased the inner area of dye transfer, 1447 +/- 161 microns2 for the islets from pregnant rats and 795 +/- 80 microns2 for the islets from virgin rats (P less than .001). These results support the hypothesis that elevated lactogen, increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased beta-cell dye coupling are associated under physiological conditions. The study indicates that enhanced beta-cell coupling is part of the structural and functional adaptation that the islets undergo during a subject's pregnancy and demonstrates that the extent of beta-cell coupling is regulated by a physiological condition.\r"

We investigated the acute and long-term effects of IL-1 on pancreatic beta-cell function in vitro. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated and kept in tissue culture for 5 days. The islets were subsequently transferred to media containing RPMI-1640 plus 1% human serum with or without human recombinant IL-1 beta (300 pM) and cultured for another 48 h. The islets were examined either immediately after IL-1 exposure (day 0) or after an additional 6-day culture period without IL-1. On day 0, IL-1 was found to totally inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release, partially inhibit glucose oxidation, and induce a decrease in islet DNA content. However, these islets were able to release insulin after stimulation with glucose plus theophylline, although the absolute rate of insulin secretion was lower than that of the control group. After 6 days in culture, the insulin-secretory response to glucose and the glucose oxidation rates of the IL-1-pretreated islets were completely restored, but there remained a reduced islet DNA content. We conclude that IL-1 is cytotoxic to islet beta-cells. However, surviving beta-cells are able to recover their functional capacity after a period of inhibited function.\r"

After institution of insulin therapy, serum C-peptide peak concentrations rose temporarily for 1-6 mo and declined thereafter. Multivariate analysis of the data showed that DR type (P = .2488) and presence of IA (P = .1604) had no effect on serum C-peptide over time, but sex (P = .0146), age at onset (P = .0002), and presence of ICA (P = .0147) significantly contributed to the variation of serum C-peptide over time. Furthermore, age at onset, presence of ICA, and sex were also the only significant predictors of the time of disappearance of the beta-cell function. The relative risks of beta-cell-function disappearance were 0.87 (P = .0015), 9.43 (P = .0181), and 2.25 (P = .0468), respectively. In conclusion, there are distinct variations in the natural course of the beta-cell function in type I diabetes. beta-Cell-function survival is significantly shortened the younger the subject is at disease onset, if ICA are present at diagnosis, and if the subject is male.\r"

L3T4+ T-lymphocytes have a role in both the initiation of insulitis and in recurrent disease in transplanted allogeneic islets in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The roles of macrophages and Lyt2+ T-lymphocytes in beta-cell destruction were studied in cyclophosphamide-induced diabetic NOD mice with silica particles and a rat anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibody. After administration of cyclophosphamide, 10 of 26 untreated mice and 1 of 21 anti-Lyt2-treated mice became diabetic. Insulitis was significantly reduced in anti-Lyt2-treated mice, and immunocytochemical staining showed a lack of Lyt2+ cells. Only 1 of 19 silica-treated mice became diabetic, compared to 8 of 19 control mice. This study demonstrates that both Lyt2+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages are necessary, but not sufficient, for beta-cell destruction in NOD mice. Therefore, we propose that macrophages present beta-cell antigen to L3T4+ cells, which induce cytotoxic Lyt2+ cells to specifically destroy beta-cells.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of chronic insulin-deficient diabetes on myocardial fuel substrate metabolism in vivo, we measured the myocardial balance of glucose, free fatty acids (FFAs), and amino acids in nine postabsorptive conscious dogs 4-6 wk after treatment with streptozocin. The acute effect of insulin on the myocardial balance of these same substrates was measured in six dogs by use of the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. To further examine the effect of insulin on heart amino acid balance, we studied three additional dogs given a constant infusion of amino acids during the insulin clamp to blunt the insulin-induced hypoaminoacidemia. In these dogs, the fasting plasma glucose concentration was markedly elevated (258 +/- 3 mg/dl). In the basal period, there was no significant glucose uptake by the heart [arterial vs. coronary sinus concentration difference (delta) = 1.0 +/- 2.0 mg/dl]; furthermore, physiologic hyperinsulinemia did not stimulate glucose uptake (delta = 2.0 +/- 2.5 mg/dl). Postabsorptively, arterial FFAs were elevated (1550 +/- 320 microM) in diabetic animals, and there was a significant net extraction of FFAs by the heart (net uptake 26 +/- 9 mumol/min; extraction ratio 30 +/- 8%). During the insulin clamp, arterial FFAs declined (645 +/- 240 microM), as did heart FFA uptake (11 +/- 6 mumol/min), and the net extraction ratio for FFAs was unchanged (30 +/- 7%). Similarly, the arterial branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentration was elevated in the postabsorptive state, and there was a significant myocardial uptake of these amino acids and of alanine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Defects in insulin-receptor structure can impair insulin-receptor function. We have previously identified qualitative abnormalities in insulin binding to insulin receptors from an insulin-resistant patient (Lep/Ark-1). The defects in insulin binding are probably caused by a defect in receptor structure. In this study, we used immunological probes to investigate the structural defect(s) responsible for the abnormal function. Several anti-receptor antibodies were impaired in their abilities to bind to the insulin receptor of Lep/Ark-1. For example, monoclonal antibody MoAb-51 was much less effective in inhibiting binding to insulin receptors from Lep/Ark-1 (ID50 70 nM) than to those of normal subjects (ID50 8 nM). In addition, there was a 10-fold reduction of the avidity with which human polyclonal antibody B-d immunoprecipitated the patient's insulin receptors. The avidity of antibody B-10 was also reduced, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, several site-specific antibodies against epitopes on the beta-subunit of the receptor bound to receptors from Lep/Ark-1 with normal avidity. The data with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are consistent with the hypothesis that the structural defect resides in the extracellular domain of this patient's insulin receptor. The normal immunoreactivity of two putative phosphorylation sites on the beta-subunit with site-specific antibodies gives further support to the conclusion that this patient's receptors have normal tyrosine kinase activity.\r"

Intraperitoneal injections of silica completely prevented the development of diabetes and insulitis in both cyclophosphamide-treated and untreated animals. Because silica is selectively toxic to macrophages, the results suggest that macrophages play an important role in the initiation of insulitis in NOD mice.\r"

No other glycolytic intermediate besides glyceraldehyde phosphate was insulinotropic. Succinate, when added to islets as either its monomethyl or dimethyl ester to increase its cellular permeability, was also insulinotropic. In islets, as in other cell types, these esters are apparently hydrolyzed intracellularly to succinate. Unesterified succinate and other unesterified citric acid-cycle intermediates did not stimulate insulin release. Initiation of insulin release by esters of succinate suggests that mitochondrial metabolism alone is sufficient to initiate and support insulin release. However, this is specific for succinate in that esters of fumarate, pyruvate, and citrate were not insulinotropic.\r"

At each point in the clinical manifestation of coronary artery disease, the practitioner has an evolving number of techniques available to guide decisions regarding prognosis and therapy. Guidelines exist for defining which patients with \"silent\" ischemia need further evaluation. The clinically manifested occurrence of angina pectoris is commonly encountered in the elderly. Prognostic stratification can occur using both invasive and non-invasive techniques. Even patients with unstable angina have different outcomes depending upon clinical presentation and therapeutic management. Finally, a large pool of patients who survive an acute myocardial infarction have a varied prognosis depending upon certain risk markers as documented with widely available non-invasive testing. This article summarizes the evaluations and decisions the physician can make regarding patients who present with the various manifestations of coronary artery disease and provides a summary of recent data supporting decisions regarding prognosis and therapy.\r"

Long-term recovery from stroke can be facilitated by skilled rehabilitation and augmented by treatment of depression and other emotional problems. Newer experimental therapies instituted during the first hours after stroke may also prove to accelerate recovery over the first 3 months after stroke.\r"

Urinary excretion of all prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites studied proved significantly higher in normotensive pregnant women than in controls. Prostaglandin E2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were significantly lower in pregnancy-induced hypertensive women than in normotensive pregnant women, whereas thromboxane B2 and 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 showed no significant differences in the two groups. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.636, p less than 0.01) was found between urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and mean blood pressure in the two groups of pregnant women taken as a whole. These data indicate that, in pregnancy-induced hypertension, there is an imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor factors, not only in the kidneys, but also at the systemic vascular level.

In the elderly, many of these mechanisms are limited in the strength, the rapidity, and the range in which they can compensate for physiological stresses and trespass. Anesthesiologists rely on predictable results from manipulation of the ANS and its effector organs, but aging in itself seems to alter the responses to these pharmacological manipulations. The diseases and medications that often accompany old age are further confounding factors. Some of the changes found with age seem to arise from the ANS itself, while some more likely originate in structural alterations of the cardiovascular system. Although both basic and clinical research reports are rife with contradictions, a knowledge of ANS aging should help us to anticipate the particular responses and requirements of our older patients.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that the ingestion of glucose alone causes a greater increase in plasma glucose levels than ingestion of the same amount of glucose given with other nutrients. Since physiological plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK) prolong gastric emptying, it is proposed that after a meal, CCK may modify plasma glucose levels by delaying glucose delivery to the duodenum. To evaluate the effect of CCK on oral glucose tolerance, plasma CCK, insulin, and glucose levels and gastric emptying rates were measured in eight normal males before and after the ingestion of 60 g glucose with the simultaneous infusion of either saline or one of two doses of CCK-8 (12 or 24 pmol/kg per h). Gastric emptying rates were measured by gamma camera scintigraphy of technetium 99m sulfur colloid and plasma CCK levels were measured by a sensitive and specific bioassay. Basal CCK levels averaged 1.0 +/- 0.1 pM (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) and increased to 7.1 +/- 1.1 pM after a mixed liquid meal. After glucose ingestion, but without CCK infusion, CCK levels did not change from basal, and the gastric emptying t1/2 was 68 +/- 3 min. Plasma glucose levels increased from basal levels of 91 +/- 3.9 mg/dl to peak levels of 162 +/- 11 mg/dl and insulin levels increased from 10.7 +/- 1.8 microU/ml to peak levels of 58 +/- 11 microU/ml. After glucose ingestion, with CCK infused at 24 pmol/kg per h, plasma CCK levels increased to 8 pM and the gastric emptying t1/2 increased to 148 +/- 16 min. In concert with this delay in gastric emptying, peak glucose levels rose to only 129 +/- 17 mg% and peak insulin levels rose to only 24.2 +/- 4.2 microU/ml. With CCK at 12 pmol/kg per h, similar but less dramatic changes were seen. To demonstrate that endogenous CCK could modify the plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose, oral glucose was given with 50 g of lipid containing long-chain triglycerides. This lipid increased peak CCK levels to 3.7 +/- 0.9 pM. Concomitant with this rise in CCK was a delay in gastric emptying and a lowering of plasma glucose and insulin values. To confirm that CCK reduced hyperglycemia by its effect on gastric motility, 36 g glucose was perfused directly into the duodenum through a nasal-duodenal feeding tube in four subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The respective roles, however, of hyperglucagonemia, insulinopenia, and carbohydrate deprivation in the inhibition of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression during fasting are poorly understood. In addition, the long-term effects of physiological hyperglucagonemia on expression of the two genes are not known. In this study, we investigate the effects of long-term physiological hyperglucagonemia and insulinopenia induced by suckling (which provides a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet) on expression of the two genes in the liver of normal newborn rats. We show that transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene is inhibited at birth and remains low during the whole suckling period, whereas transcription of the PEP carboxykinase gene is maximal in the neonate, and then decreases despite very high levels of plasma glucagon during suckling. In contrast to the adult, however, in which L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression in the liver is blocked by cAMP and stimulated by carbohydrates, the regulation of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression in the newborn undergoes a developmental maturation: the inhibitory effect of glucagon is never complete in developing rat liver and the stimulatory effect of glucose could not be detected during suckling, due to either hyperglucagonemia, immaturity of the gene regulatory system, or both.\r"

The activity of acyl-coenzyme A:dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, which is deficient in these diseases, was used as an index of complementation. In some of these diseases peroxisomes are deficient and catalase is present in the cytosol, so that the appearance of particle-bound catalase could be used as an index of complementation. The cell lines studied can be divided into at least five complementation groups. Group 1 is represented by a cell line from a patient with the rhizomelic form of chondrodysplasia punctata. Group 2 consists of cell lines from four patients with the Zellweger syndrome, a patient with the infantile form of Refsum disease and a patient with hyperpipecolic acidemia. Group 3 comprises one cel line from a patient with the Zellweger syndrome, group 4 one cell line from a patient with the neonatal form of adrenoleukodystrophy, and group 5 one cell line from a patient with the Zellweger syndrome. We conclude that at least five genes are required for the assembly of a functional peroxisome.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of decreasing the frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation on pituitary responsiveness were studied in (a) men with isolated GnRH deficiency who had achieved normal sex steroid levels during prior long-term pulsatile GnRH replacement and (b) perifused dispersed pituitary cells from male rats in the absence of sex steroids. In three groups of four GnRH-deficient men, the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased at weekly intervals from (a) every 2-3-4 h (group I), (b) every 2-8 h without testosterone replacement (group II), or (c) every 2-8 h with testosterone replacement (group III). In three groups of three columns of perifused dispersed pituitary cells, pulses of GnRH were administered every 2, 4, or 8 h. In groups I and II, mean area under the luteinizing hormone (LH) curve increased (P less than 0.025) and serum testosterone levels fell (P less than 0.035) as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. In group III, the area under the LH curve also increased (P less than 0.01) although serum testosterone levels were constant, thereby demonstrating that the increase in pituitary responsiveness to slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation occurs independently of changes in the sex steroid hormonal milieu. The area under the LH curve also increased in the perifused dispersed rat pituitary cells when the frequency of GnRH administration was decreased to every 8 h (P less than 0.05), thus demonstrating that the enhanced pituitary responsiveness to slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation is maintained even in the complete absence of gonadal steroids. Nadir LH levels fell in all three groups (P less than 0.01) as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. In contrast, mean peak LH levels, the rate of LH rise, and the rate of endogenous LH decay were constant as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. Finally, as the GnRH interpulse interval increased, mean LH levels fell, and mean follicle-stimulating hormone levels were stable or fell. These results indicate that (a) pituitary responsiveness to GnRH increases at slower frequencies of GnRH stimulation in models both in vivo and in vitro, (b) these changes in pituitary responsiveness occur independently of changes in gonadal steroid secretion, and (c) the increases in LH pulse amplitude and area under the curve at slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation are due to decreases in nadir, but not peak, LH levels. Slowing of the frequency of GnRH secretion may be an important independent variable in the control of pituitary gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether glucose metabolic clearance increases and whether catecholamines influence glucose turnover during exercise in total insulin deficiency, 24-h fasted and insulin-deprived pancreatectomized dogs were studied before and during exercise (60 min; 100 m/min; 10% slope) with (n = 8) and without (n = 8) propranolol infusion (PI, 5 micrograms/kg-min). Exercise with or without PI was accompanied by four and fivefold increments in norepinephrine and epinephrine respectively, while glucagon (extrapancreatic) fell slightly. Basal plasma glucose and FFA concentrations and rates of tracer-determined (3[3H]glucose) hepatic glucose production (Ra) and total glucose clearance (including urinary glucose loss) were 459 +/- 24 mg/dl, 1.7 +/- 0.5 mmol/liter, 7.8 +/- 0.9 mg/kg-min and 1.6 +/- 0.1 ml/kg-min, respectively. When corrected for urinary glucose excretion, basal glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg/kg-min and rose twofold (P less than 0.0001) during exercise. Despite lower lactate (3.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmol/liter; P less than 0.005) and FFA levels (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter; P less than 0.0001) with PI, PI failed to influence MCR during exercise. Ra rose by 3.7 +/- 1.7 mg/kg-min during exercise (P less than 0.02) while with PI the increase was only 1.9 +/- 0.7 mg/kg-min (P less than 0.002). Glucose levels remained unchanged during exercise alone but fell slightly with PI (P less than 0.0001). Therefore, in total insulin deficiency, MCR increases marginally with exercise (13% of normal); the beta adrenergic effects of catecholamines that stimulate both FFA mobilization and muscle glycogenolysis do not regulate muscle glucose uptake. The exercise-induced rise in hepatic glucose production does not require an increase in glucagon levels, but is mediated partially by catecholamines. Present and previous data in normal and alloxan-diabetic dogs, suggest that (a) in total insulin deficiency, control of hepatic glucose production during exercise is shifted from glucagon to catecholamines and that this may involve catecholamine-induced mobilization of peripheral substrates for gluconeogenesis and/or hepatic insensitivity to glucagon, and (b) insulin is not essential for a small exercise-induced increase in muscle glucose uptake, but normal insulin levels are required for the full response. Furthermore, the catecholamines appear to regulate muscle glucose uptake during exercise only when sufficient insulin is available to prevent markedly elevated FFA levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Twitcher mice have a hereditary deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase, which causes growth delay, tremor, and paralysis of the hind legs. Death occurs at 30-40 d of age. After BMT galactosylceramidase activity increased to donor levels in hemopoietic organs. In lung, heart, and liver, galactosylceramidase activity rose to levels intermediate between those of twitcher and normal mice. Increased galactosylceramidase activity in liver parenchymal cells indicated uptake of the donor enzyme by recipient cells of nonhemopoietic origin. Enzyme activity also increased in kidney tissue. BMT resulted in a gradual increase in galactosylceramidase activity in the central nervous system to 15% of normal donor levels. A 5-6-fold increase in galactosylceramidase activity was found in the peripheral nervous system. This increase in enzyme activity was accompanied by a partial alleviation of neurological symptoms. In particular, paralysis of the hind legs was prevented by BMT. BMT led to a modest restoration of growth and prolonged survival. In several cases, the mice survived for more than 100 d, but eventually all animals died with severe neurological disease.\r"

  ".W": "We recently showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 sensitively inhibited the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in normal human mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the human T lymphotropic virus I immortalized T cell line known as S-LB1 at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Using S-LB1 cells as a model system the present paper identifies at least in part the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the expression of GM-CSF. Time-course studies demonstrated that by 6 and 48 h of exposure of S-LB1 cells to 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-8) M) the GM-CSF mRNA levels were reduced by 50 and 90%, respectively. Studies using cycloheximide as a protein synthesis inhibitor showed that the inhibitory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 on GM-CSF expression was dependent on new protein synthesis. In vitro nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-8) M) did not change the rate of transcription of the GM-CSF gene. The t1/2 of GM-CSF mRNA, however, was profoundly reduced by 1,25(OH)2D3 when transcription was blocked by actinomycin D compared with the half-life of GM-CSF in the presence of actinomycin D alone (t1/2, less than 0.5 and 4 h, respectively). Taken together, these results demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates expression of the lymphokine GM-CSF posttranscriptionally by influencing the stability of GM-CSF mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the in vitro susceptibility of Candida albicans to three defensins from human neutrophilic granulocytes (HNP-1, 2, and 3), a homologous defensin from rabbit leukocytes (NP-1), and four unrelated cationic peptides. Although the primary amino acid sequences of HNP-1, 2, and 3 are identical except for a single amino-terminal amino acid alteration, HNP-1 and HNP-2 killed C. albicans but HNP-3 did not. C. albicans blastoconidia were protected from HNP-1 when incubations were performed in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of inhibitors that blocked both of its mitochondrial respiratory pathways. Neither anaerobiosis nor mitochondrial inhibitors substantially protected C. albicans exposed to NP-1, poly-L-arginine, poly-L-lysine, or mellitin. Human neutrophilic granulocyte defensin-mediated candidacidal activity was inhibited by both Mg2+ and Ca2+, and was unaffected by Fe2+. In contrast, Fe2+ inhibited the candidacidal activity of NP-1 and all of the model cationic peptides, whereas Mg2+ inhibited none of them. These data demonstrate that susceptibility of C. albicans to human defensins depends both on the ionic environment and on the metabolic state of the target cell. The latter finding suggests that leukocyte-mediated microbicidal mechanisms may manifest oxygen dependence for reasons unrelated to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates by the leukocyte.\r"

  ".W": "Prior physiological studies have suggested that parasympathetic control is altered in heart failure. The goal of our studies was to investigate the influence of heart failure on the muscarinic receptor, and its coupling to adenylate cyclase. Ligand binding studies using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and enriched left ventricular (LV) sarcolemma, demonstrated that muscarinic receptor density in heart failure declined 36% from a control of 5.6 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg, with no change in antagonist affinity. However, agonist competition studies with both carbachol and oxotremorine showed that it was a loss of high affinity agonist binding sites in the sarcolemma from failing LV that accounted for this difference. The functional efficacy of the muscarinic receptor was also examined. When 1 microM methacholine was added to 0.1 mM GTP and 0.1 mM isoproterenol, adenylate cyclase stimulated activity was inhibited by 15% in normal LV but only 5% in LV sarcolemma from animals with heart failure even when the reduced adenylate cyclase in these heart failure animals was taken into account. Even at 100-fold greater concentrations of methacholine, significantly less inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was observed in LV failure as compared with normal LV sarcolemma. Levels of the GTP-inhibitory protein known to couple the muscarinic receptor to adenylate cyclase, as measured with pertussis toxin labeling, were not depressed in LV failure. Thus, the inhibitory pathway regulating LV adenylate cyclase activity is defective in heart failure. The decrease in muscarinic receptor density, and in particular the specific loss of the high affinity agonist binding component of this receptor population, appears to be the major factor underlying this abnormality.\r"

SP-40,40 is deposited in the renal glomeruli of patients with glomerulonephritis but is not found in normal glomeruli. The protein is a heterodimeric structure of relative molecular mass 80 kD, both chains of which are of a similar size (40 kD). The amino-terminal sequences of both chains are unrelated to one another and possess no significant homology to any known protein sequence. The tissue distribution of SP-40,40 closely resembles that of the terminal complement components and its physicochemical properties are similar to, but distinct from, those of the S protein of complement. We have identified SP-40,40 in the SC5b-9 complex of complement and have demonstrated incorporation of labeled SP-40,40 into this complex. These data suggest that SP-40,40 is an additional component of SC5b-9.\r"

  ".U": "88257467\r", 
  ".W": "Glucose cycling (GC; G in equilibrium G6P) equals 14% of glucose production in postabsorptive man. Our aim was to determine glucose cycling in six lean and six overweight mild type II diabetics (fasting glycemia: 139 +/- 10 and 152 +/- 7 mg/dl), in postabsorptive state (PA) and during glucose infusion (2 mg/kg per min). 14 control subjects were weight and age matched. GC is a function of the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction opposite the net flux and is the difference between hepatic total glucose output (HTGO) (2-[3H]glucose) and hepatic glucose production (HGP) (6-[3H]-glucose). Postabsorptively, GC is a function of glucokinase. With glucose infusion the flux is reversed (net glucose uptake), and GC is a function of glucose 6-phosphatase. In PA, GC was increased by 100% in lean (from 0.25 +/- 0.07 to 0.43 +/- .08 mg/kg per min) and obese (from 0.22 +/- 0.05 to 0.50 +/- 0.07) diabetics. HGP and HTGO increased in lean and obese diabetics by 41 and 33%. Glucose infusion suppressed apparent phosphatase activity and gluconeogenesis much less in diabetics than controls, resulting in marked enhancement (400%) in HTGO and HGP, GC remained increased by 100%. Although the absolute responses of C-peptide and insulin were comparable to those of control subjects, they were inappropriate for hyperglycemia. Peripheral insulin resistance relates to decreased metabolic glucose clearance (MCR) and inadequate increase of uptake during glucose infusion. We conclude that increases in HGP and HTGO and a decrease of MCR are characteristic features of mild type II diabetes and are more pronounced during glucose infusion. There is also an increase in hepatic GC, a stopgap that controls changes from glucose production to uptake. Postabsorptively, this limits the increase of HGP and glycemia. In contrast, during glucose infusion, increased GC decreases hepatic glucose uptake and thus contributes to hyperglycemia. Obesity per se did not affect GC. An increase in glucose cycling and turnover indicate hepatic insulin resistance that is observed in addition to peripheral resistance. It is hypothesized that in pathogenesis of type II diabetes, augmented activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and kinase may be of importance.\r"

Only one serum (and its IgG) modestly inhibited insulin binding and stimulated glucose oxidation. We conclude (a) that sera from 9/104 diabetics (five insulin-dependent and four noninsulin-dependent) contained a newly identified species of IgG antiinsulin receptor autoantibodies (AIRA), which bound to the insulin receptor at a locus different from the insulin binding site and did not inhibit insulin binding; and (b) that only 1/104 diabetic sera contained low-titer \"conventional\" antiinsulin receptor autoantibodies that bound to the insulin receptor at or near the insulin binding site, inhibited insulin binding and caused a clinical condition, which was difficult to distinguish from typical NIDDM.\r"

  ".U": "88257470\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we reported that immunization of mice with ungulate insulins induced the development of antiinsulin antibodies, which include an idiotype that appeared to recognize the part of the insulin molecule recognized by the hormone receptor. The antiinsulin antibodies of this idiotype were replaced spontaneously by antiidiotypic antibodies. The antiidiotypic antibodies, which persisted for about 14 d, mimicked insulin and functioned as antibodies to the insulin receptor. They induced down regulation, desensitization and refractoriness of the insulin receptor and disturbances in glucose homeostasis in vivo (Shechter, Y., D. Elias, R. Maron, and I.R. Cohen., 1984; Elias, D., R. Maron, I.R. Cohen, and Y. Shechter. 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259: 6411-6419). We now report that effects of the antiidiotypic antibodies on the insulin receptor effector system can be modified pharmacologically. Administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol during the period of insulin resistance (days 26-40 after primary immunization), largely restored fat cell responsiveness to insulin, and eliminated the appearance of fasting hyperglycemia. This restoration appeared to be caused by inhibition of both insulin receptor desensitization and refractoriness. In contrast, down regulation of insulin receptors was not reversed by isoproterenol treatment in vivo. The effects of treatment with isoproterenol persisted for 2-4 d after termination of treatment. The beta-antagonist, propranolol and more so, the beta 1a-antagonist metoprolol, specifically blocked the effect of isoproterenol at a molar ratio of 3-10:1. Oral administration of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, aminophylline, was also effective in inhibiting the development of desensitization in fat cells. These results indicate that treatment with beta 1-adrenergic agonists in vivo, or other agents that elevate cellular cAMP levels, can inhibit the development of the \"postbinding\" defects induced by insulin-mimicking, antireceptor antibodies. These observations have both basic and clinical implications.\r"

Sera from 16 HG and 17 BP patients, and from normal pregnant women were evaluated by immunofluorescent (IF) studies and immunoblotted against human epidermal extracts. 89% of HG sera with circulating antibodies by IF recognized a 180-kD protein by immunoblotting. 71% of BP sera recognized a 240-kD band, but 47% detected a 180-kD protein that comigrated with the antigen detected by HG sera. None of the control sera recognized any specific bands.

A total of 2016 routine blood samples yielded 186 (9%) clinically important isolates. Of these, 40 (21%) were isolated only in the Oxoid system and 30 (17%) only in the conventional system. One hundred and sixteen (62%) were isolated from both systems. Volume of blood was not significantly associated with the rate of detection but was significantly associated with the speed of detection. A continuation of the study with a Signal bottle and single conventional bottle confirmed initial results of the increased isolation rate using two systems. The Oxoid single bottle blood culture system was at least comparable with a conventional system in terms of rate of detection of organisms and was superior in terms of speed of detection.\r"

  ".W": "A new method of blood culture, the Signal system (Oxoid), was assessed in paediatric practice. Isolation rates of pathogens, frequency of contamination (false positive results), and time taken to detect positive cultures were analysed. Four hundred and seventy nine organisms were isolated from 457 of 3000 cultures collected, of which 283 organisms were considered to be clinically important. The overall rate of positive cultures was 15.2%, and clinically important organisms were isolated from 9.1%, giving an overall contamination rate of 6.1%. The rate of contamination with Gram positive bacilli was 1.1% and coagulase negative staphylococci 4.2%. Over 51.6% of all isolates were detected within 24 hours, 81% within 48 hours, and 86% within three days: 91.1% of clinically important organisms were isolated within three days. Unimportant organisms tended to give a delayed signal, although this sometimes occurred with Candida spp, Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas spp and a small number of other such organisms. Four hundred and forty nine of the 457 positive cultures gave a visible signal. Six of seven isolates of Haemophilus influenzae failed to give a signal, as did two coagulase negative staphylococci. The Signal system is a convenient and cost effective method of blood culture.\r"

Particle agglutination was very simple to perform and was the most sensitive, though the least specific test. Antibody titres were 10-100 times higher when measured by particle agglutination than by other tests, and antibody titers were considerably higher in patients with neurological disease related to HTLV I than in those with other conditions. Serodia-ATLA is the method of choice for preliminary screening of specimens for antibody to HTLV I, but positive results must be confirmed by another technique.\r"

In this study we used a specific, highly sensitive monoclonal antibody to evaluate sex steroid receptors in human basal cell carcinoma.

We conclude that these sex steroid receptors are not present in significant amounts to mediate a direct effect in basal carcinoma.\r"

The major histologic feature of all variants is acantholysis, the disruption of normal cell-to-cell adhesion, which leads to intraepidermal blister formation. Most patients with pemphigus demonstrate IgG autoantibodies directed against an antigen located on the surface of keratinocytes. Although the stimulus for autoantibody production is unknown, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of acantholysis. One popular model proposes that pemphigus antibodies induce acantholysis through local stimulation of the plasminogen-plasmin system. Another model proposes that pemphigus antibodies fix complement and thereby alter cell membrane integrity to produce acantholysis. Prior to the availability of corticosteroids, pemphigus vulgaris was commonly fatal. Treatment with glucocorticosteroids has drastically improved the prognosis. Immunosuppressive agents and plasmapheresis have been used successfully in some patients with severe disease.\r"

  ".W": "This review presents evidence for the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. T lymphocytes with human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules and receptors for interleukin 2 were found in the dermis of psoriatic plaques, suggesting the presence of activated T cells in these lesions. Keratinocytes in active plaques demonstrated HLA-DR molecules on their surfaces. These immunologic abnormalities were reversible with medical therapy. Keratinocyte HLA-DR expression was associated with an increased incidence of psoriatic arthritis. We propose that HLA-DR + keratinocytes and Langerhans cells in plaques could activate dermal T cells directly in an autologous mixed leucocyte/epithelial cell reaction. Alternatively, they could present an unknown autologous or exogenous antigen to T lymphocytes. T cell activation would then lead to the release of mediators of inflammation, and possibly of epidermal growth factors. This hypothesis also provides an explanation for the chronicity of psoriasis. Most of the therapies used to treat psoriasis suppress cellular immune function and inflammation. These include ultraviolet irradiation, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, methotrexate, anthralin, and retinoids.\r"

  ".W": "Iron deficiency is widely observed worldwide, yet, paradoxically, iron is the most plentiful heavy metal in the earth's crust. Although absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract is strictly controlled, excretion is limited to iron lost from exfoliation of skin and gastrointestinal cells, customary and abnormal blood loss, and menses. Individuals highly vulnerable to iron deficiency have high iron needs, as during growth or pregnancy; high iron loss, as during marked hemorrhage or excessive and/or frequent menstrual losses; or diets with low iron content or bioavailability. Food iron is classified as heme or nonheme. Approximately half of the iron in meat, fish, and poultry is heme iron. Depending on an individual's iron stores, 15% to 35% of heme iron is absorbed. Food contains more nonheme iron and, thus, it makes the larger contribution to the body's iron pool despite its lower absorption rate of 2% to 20%. Absorption of nonheme iron is markedly influenced by the levels of iron stores and by concomitantly consumed dietary components. Enhancing factors, such as ascorbic acid and meat/fish/poultry, may increase nonheme iron bioavailability fourfold.\r"

  ".W": "Often the complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have a negative impact on nutritional status. Weight loss and protein depletion are commonly seen among the AIDS population. Though the relationship between disease progression and nutritional status has not been established, maintaining good nutritional status may support response to treatment of opportunistic infections and improve patient strength and comfort. Increased nutrient needs, decreased nutrient intake, and impaired nutrient absorption contribute to malnutrition in AIDS patients. Causes of decreased nutrient intake and absorption may be poor appetite, oral and esophageal pain, mechanical problems with eating, and gastrointestinal complications (diarrhea and malabsorption). Causes of these impediments to maintaining nutritional status are discussed, and suggestions to overcome them are given. Dietitians working with AIDS patients need to understand how the complications of the disease might affect nutritional status so that strategies for nutrition treatment can be developed. Nutrition care of AIDS patients requires that dietitians and their support personnel provide supportive, nonjudgmental care. The patients should be included in decision making regarding their nutrition care. Caring for AIDS patients in the community and through home care agencies represents an area in need of the expertise of a dietetics professional.\r"

A discussion of research on health perceptions suggests that some elderly may inappropriately deny illness and delay seeking medical care, while others with overly negative health perceptions may make excessive physician visits. An overview is presented of the process by which elderly individuals come to seek care from their physicians, combining evidence from the diverse literatures on chronic illness, atypical presentation of disease, and health perceptions. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this information for clinicians working with the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "We were unable to validate the predictive ability of a previously described mneumonic (SAD PERSONS score, SPS) for determining the need for hospitalization of patients who have expressed suicidal ideation or behavior. After reviewing published studies on the subject, we arrived at a modification of this scale (MSPS). The MSPS obtained by nonpsychiatric and psychiatric house staff was compared and correlated with patient disposition for 100 consecutive adult patients presenting to the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center emergency department for the assessment of suicidal behavior. We were unable to correlate the MSPS with patient disposition. However, four criteria were found to correlate with the need for hospitalization (P less than .001). After weighting the MSPS, giving two points for each of these four criteria, and one point for each of the other six, we found that a score of greater than or equal to 6 had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 71% in identifying need for hospitalization. A score of less than or equal to 5 had a negative predictive value for hospitalization of 95%. When two nonsuicidal patients, admitted for situational reasons only, were eliminated, a score of greater than or equal to 6 had a 100% sensitivity and a score of less than or equal to 5 had a 100% negative predictive value in identifying patients requiring hospitalization. Subsequent use of the weighted MSPS for an additional 82 patients confirmed these results. Follow-up of 97.5% (116/119) of all patients discharged from the emergency department at 6 to 12 months found no mortalities. Using a weighted MSPS, nonpsychiatrists can quickly and easily obtain the objective information necessary to make an initial assessment of suicidality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Suppression of the function of Th cells in vivo by chronic treatment with anti-L3T4 mAb prevented congenic strains of mice from being primed and from generating CTL specific for Ag encoded by the minor histocompatibility loci--H-3, H-1, and B2m. Analysis of proliferative responses and lymphokine secretion of cells from animals primed with one of these minor H Ag, beta 2-microglobulin, but not treated with anti-L3T4 antibodies, indicated that L3T4- class I MHC-restricted T cells were themselves responsible for the very great majority of the observed minor H Ag-specific proliferation and secretion of lymphokines associated with both T cell proliferation and activation of CTL. All together, the data indicate that in responses against discrete minor H Ag, L3T4+Th-independent CTL are generated through an L3T4+Th-dependent pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Our study investigates the effect of a prior graft-vs-host (GVH) reaction on the subsequent ability of irradiated, bone marrow-re-populated mice to develop T cell function. The results indicate that such GVH-bone marrow transplanted (BMT) mice do not generate CTL responses to trinitrophenyl-modified syngeneic cells (TNP-self), but do generate strong CTL activity to H-2 alloantigens. This selective deficiency in TNP-self CTL response potential appeared as early as 10 days after GVH, and required both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ donor T cells. The in vitro addition of either soluble Th factors or L3T4-enriched spleen cells from normal mice circumvented the defect in the TNP-self response in GVH-BMT mice. These results indicate that T effector function was not defective, and instead suggest a Th defect. Cell depletion and antibody-blocking, as well as IL-2 production experiments, indicate that the Th defect was selective for L3T4+ Th population and not for Lyt-2+ Th population. This defect in L3T4 Th function is not accounted for by the approximate twofold reduction in L3T4 cell numbers in GVH-BMT mice, because IL-2 production and CTL generation to L3T4-dependent Ag were at least eightfold below control levels. Rather, defective L3T4 Th function appears to be the consequence of a GVH-induced defect in thymic maturation because the defect was corrected in vivo by a neonatal parental thymus graft before irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. This system may be useful for elucidating the role of the thymus in the maturation of Th cells. Our findings raise the possibility that impaired development of T cell function occurring in marrow grafted patients who have undergone a GVH reaction could be partly due to a GVH-induced thymic defect.\r"

In this report we describe the production and functional characterization of two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CSF-1 obtained from rat X rat hybridomas. These two mAb are functionally distinct and recognize different epitopes on CSF-1. The mAb 5A1 binds to and inhibits the biologic function of CSF-1, and the second mAb (D24) binds CSF-1 but does not neutralize its biologic activity. The mAb 5A1 inhibits colony formation of tissue mononuclear phagocyte colony-forming cells as well as the committed bone marrow stem cells for both granulocytes and monocytes. The extent of colony inhibition by mAb 5A1 is dependent on the tissue origin of colony-forming cells. CSF-1 complexed with mAb 5A1 does not bind to its cell surface receptor of peritoneal exudate macrophages, and mAb 5A1 does not complex with cell-bound CSF-1. Although both bone marrow cell-derived macrophages and J774.1 macrophages bind CSF-1, mAb 5A1 inhibits the proliferation of only bone marrow cell-derived macrophages. The non-neutralizing mAb D24 does not block binding of CSF-1 to its cellular receptor, and it recognizes cell-bound CSF-1.\r"

  ".W": "Two recombinant human preparations of CSF, namely granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) and IL-3 (multi-CSF), were tested for their ability to stimulate the growth of human freshly separated and in vitro activated lymphocytes. Both CSF independently induced short term proliferation in unfractionated PBL and lectin-stimulated T cells. Despite the great variability among different donors in the magnitude of lymphocyte response to the two growth factors, IL-3 at suboptimal concentrations (10 U/ml) consistently induced a higher proliferative response than did GM-CSF at suboptimal concentrations (5 ng/ml) in all of the preparations tested. When used in combination with IL-2, GM-CSF and, especially, IL-3 significantly potentiated the proliferative responses induced by IL-2 in both unstimulated and mitogen-activated lymphocytes. Dose-response curves using increasing concentrations of IL-2 and IL-3 and isobologram analysis of these interactions revealed a clear synergy of action between the two growth factors in inducing proliferation of unfractionated PBL, purified T cells, mitogen-activated lymphocytes, and alloantigen-stimulated T cells. In addition to enhancing the short term responsiveness to IL-2, GM-CSF and, especially, IL-3 drastically potentiated the long term growth of non-activated human lymphocytes and of lectin- or Ag-activated T cells in the presence of IL-2. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated a higher expression of activation Ag (anti-Tac receptors and HLA class II Ag) in cultures incubated in the presence of IL-3 either alone or in conjunction with IL-2. The overall data indicate that human GM-CSF and IL-3 can support the growth of cells within the lymphoid lineage and exert potent amplifying effects on IL-2-induced T cell growth in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced migration across polycarbonate or nitrocellulose filters of human peripheral blood monocytes. Checkerboard analysis of M-CSF-induced migration, performed by seeding different cytokine concentrations above and below the filter, revealed that the locomotory response involved chemotaxis, though some gradient-independent augmentation of migration occurred. Polymixin B did not affect M-CSF chemotaxis and M-CSF was active on monocytes from the LPS-unresponsive mouse strain C3H/HeJ. These findings rule out a contribution of minute endotoxin contamination, below the sensitivity of the Limulus assay, in M-CSF chemotaxis. Rabbit anti-M-CSF antibodies inhibited the chemotactic activity of recombinant M-CSF, thus further indicating that the M-CSF molecule was indeed responsible for chemotaxis. M-CSF preparations encoded by 224 or 522 amino acid cDNA clones were equally effective in inducing monocyte migration. Recombinant M-CSF did not elicit a migratory response in large granular lymphocytes and in endothelial cells under conditions in which appropriate reference attractants were active. A modest stimulation of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibitable by antibodies, was observed at high cytokine concentrations (10 to 100 times higher than those required for monocyte locomotion). The maximal polymorphonuclear leukocytes response evoked by M-CSF was small compared to that evoked by reference chemoattractants or to that evoked by the same cytokine in monocytes. Hence, M-CSF is a potent chemoattractant for mononuclear phagocytes and exerts its action preferentially on cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. M-CSF, produced locally by activated macrophages, may play a role in the selective recruitment from the blood compartment of mononuclear phagocytes to amplify resistance against certain noxious agents.\r"

Adherence of monocytes to C1q-coated surfaces induced a significant enhancement of ingestion of CN blastospores that had been opsonized with specific anticapsular IgG (IgG-CN). Additionally, C1q enhanced the monocyte-mediated phagocytosis of CN opsonized with C (CN-absorbed, nonimmune, normal human serum; C-CN). Ingestion of IgG- and C-CN by control and C1q-stimulated monocytes was maximal by 1 h of incubation. The monocyte-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis caused by C1q was paralleled by a proportionate increase in fungicidal activity, an effect which was maximal by 3 h of incubation. Human serum albumin-adherent, control monocytes exhibited only a low level of killing after 3 h of incubation. C1q enhancement was blocked by preincubation of the surfaces with a goat, polyclonal F(ab')2 anti-C1q. This study describes a new cellular function for the cell surface C1q receptor: the enhancement of phagocytosis of a pathogenic organism by monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the physiologic mechanisms responsible for enhanced antibacterial activity during infection with Listeria monocytogenes (LM), we developed an in vitro assay for quantifying leukocyte anti-listerial activity (LAA) in spleen and bone marrow. When LAA was serially measured in C57B1/6 (B6) mice infected i.v. with LM, two distinct phases of response were observed. Splenic LAA increased four- to fivefold during the first 2 days after i.v. infusion of LM (from 2.4 +/- 1.8 U/spleen before infection to 11.8 +/- 2.4, p less than 0.01), dropped significantly on days 3 to 4, and increased again to similar levels from days 5 to 7. A fall in bone marrow activity from the 3.5 +/- 1.5 to 1.6 +/- 0.7 U/mouse (two femurs) coincided with the initial rise in splenocyte activity, and was followed by a gradual return to base line. Bacterial containment in vivo correlated well with splenic LAA in vitro. Carbonyl iron pretreatment of cells from both normal and LM-infected animals ablated LAA, suggesting the effectors were phagocytic. LAA in normal spleens was unaffected by 400 rad; LAA of normal marrow as well as splenocyte and marrow cell suspensions obtained 2 days after LM infection was markedly reduced by this dose of irradiation. Quantitative studies of spleen composition revealed a 10-fold increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils between day 0 and day 2 followed by a marked decrease on day 3; this pattern closely resembled the changes in LAA observed during the same period. In contrast, splenic macrophage number did not increase from base line until after day 3. To look for evidence of changes in the efficiency of bacterial killing by phagocytes during infection, we calculated LAA/splenic phagocyte. The efficiency of killing increased threefold over base line within 1 day after LM infusion but we detected no additional increases later in infection. Because cytokines may have mediated some or all of the changes observed, we measured the capacity of splenocytes obtained at various times after infection to produce IL-2, TNF, and IFN-gamma in vitro. TNF activity increased in parallel with the first and second LAA peaks, whereas increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma activity were associated only with the second.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Five epitopes have been precisely mapped by using the synthetic peptides in inhibition ELISA experiments, and five others have been located on peptides of 22 amino acids or less in length. The epitope of an important species-specific antibody, IIIE9, which may be useful for seriodiagnosis of leprosy, appears to be distinguished from the epitope of the antibody IVD2, widely cross-reactive among mycobacteria, not by its sequence, but only by its critical residues.

There was a proliferative response to X5563, MH134, and MM48, but not to the two other tumor cells, MM46 and FM3A/R. The responder spleen cells were found to be nonadherent cells with a phenotype of Thy-1-L3T4-Lyt2-Ig-Macl-, which were neither mature T and B cells nor mature macrophage/granulocytes. It was also found that the proliferation of these nonadherent no-marker cells was mediated by tumor cell-derived soluble factors but not by direct stimulation with tumor cells. The responsible factor was a molecule(s) with a Mr of 23 to 25 kDa, which had a CSF activity inducing granulocyte (G)-, macrophage (M)- and G + M-colonies in the bone marrow cells. Neutralization tests of this factor-induced proliferation of spleen cells revealed that a major part of the factor may be GM-CSF or a molecule closely related to it. Incubation of spleen mononuclear cells with these GM-CSF-like tumor cell factors resulted in induction of myeloblastic/promyelocytic cells with a phenotype of Mac-1+2+Ia+ Thy-1-L3T4-Lyt2-Ig- in the spleen cell cultures, which could suppress mitogenic responses of the spleen cells to T and B cell mitogens. GM-CSF-like activity could also be detected in the serum of mice bearing X5563, MH134, and MM48, but not in those bearing MM46 and FM3A/R. Subcutaneous inoculation of C3H/HeN mice with these X5563, MH134, and MM48 tumor cells generated massive metastasis in the lung and lymph nodes, whereas MM46 and FM3A/R produced no macroscopic tumor cell metastasis. These results strongly suggest the possibility that in some tumor cell-host systems, a GM-CSF-like factor(s) produced constitutively by the tumor cells may play an important role in the development of tumor metastasis, mediating through suppression of lymphoid tissues of the host.\r"

In order to determine the biologic significance of epinectin, we determined the distribution of epinectin in various rat epithelial tissues by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Polyclonal antibodies to epinectin stained basal cells and basilar regions of skin, urinary bladder, and vagina. There was predominantly cytoplasmic staining along with amorphous extracellular staining. Strong staining was also noted in sebaceous glands and hair follicles. The immunoreactivity for epinectin in the skin was distinct from that for fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. Antibodies to epinectin also stained subpopulations of neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Epinectin antibodies strongly stained the cytoplasm of some pineal cells and cells of the pars intermedia of the pituitary. The distribution of epinectin suggests a role not only in epithelial cell-substratum adhesion, but in neuronal cell function. Heparan sulfate is known to be involved in the binding of several adhesion promoting molecules to cell surfaces. In order to assess the mechanism of adhesion of epinectin to cells, we measured the binding of 3H-heparin to epinectin. Binding of 3H-heparin was concentration dependent and inhibitable with cold heparin.\r"
