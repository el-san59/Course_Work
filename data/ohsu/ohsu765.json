One fiber is attached to a nearby slit-lamp microscope; the other extends approximately 70 m and can be connected to either an operating microscope or an endophotocoagulation probe. An electrically-operated mirror inside the machine controls which of the two fibers the laser beam passes through. Separate control boxes for each fiber permit direct regulation of the photocoagulation process in all situations.\r"

  ".U": "90231697\r", 
  ".W": "We designed an intraocular lens (IOL) with spring action, which we call the Spring IOL, with the idea of providing a slight but adequate accommodative power. The Spring IOL consists of two 6.0-mm optics, held 4.38 mm apart, and four flexible loops. The optics are made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and the loops of polyvinylidene fluoride. The lens's refractive power is provided by the anterior optic; the posterior optic acts as a footplate to restrict the anteroposterior movement of the anterior optic. By torsionally compressing the obliquely arranged loops, a 10.0-mm 3-dimensional IOL can be reduced to 6.0 mm and inserted in the capsular bag through a 3.5-mm capsular opening. Because the Spring IOL is made of the same materials as conventional IOLs, most of the problems hindering the development of a refilling material (which could also provide accommodation) are avoided. In this first report we discuss the design of the lens, the refractive theory involved, and our experience inserting it in an excised animal eye.\r"

Before phenylephrine testing or surgery, an average of 2.3 mm of ptosis was present. Topical phenylephrine elevated upper lids an average of 2.2 mm. The amount of elevation produced by the phenylephrine guided the amount of Muller's muscle and conjunctiva resected. Postoperative upper lid levels were exactly symmetrical in five of six patients. In one patient the previously ptotic lid was 0.5 mm higher than the contralateral lid. Even though Muller's muscle is rendered nonfunctional in Horner's syndrome by denervation, the Muller's muscle-conjunctival resection procedure proved to be a very effective method of treating ptosis in this setting. Our findings imply that the mechanism by which this procedure alleviates ptosis is independent of active contraction of Muller's muscle.\r"

Recognition of the prolapsed gland and its replacement into the lacrimal gland fossa in craniosynostosis syndromes, as well as in cases of poor function congenital ptosis in general, allows the temporal eyelid to approach a more normal position, yielding an improved functional and cosmetic result.\r"

The younger the child, the greater the renal clearance of uric acid and the greater the excretion of uric acid expressed as mg per kg body weight. During infancy, the reduced ability to maximally concentrate the urine may protect against precipitation of uric acid crystals within the kidney. Conversely, the extremely high urinary uric concentrations places the very small infant at jeopardy during sudden increases in the filtered load of uric acid. Understanding the pharmacologic and physiologic modulators of renal uric acid clearance will allow the pediatrician to minimize the risk of uric acid nephropathy, and to understand the implications of uric acid in the serum or urine in children with fluid and electrolyte disorders. Certainly evaluation of serum and urinary uric acid concentrations is essential in any child with acute renal failure.\r"

Of the 176,790 neonates born during this period, the amniotic fluid was stained in 21,472 (12.15%). Subsequently, MAS developed in 1162 (5.41%) of the meconium-stained neonates. Male neonates were more prone to the disorder than female neonates (P = .022). There were no racial predilections for MAS. The incidence of MAS significantly decreased during the 15 years (P = .043). Of the neonates with MAS, 49 (4.22%) died as a direct consequence of the disorder. The death rate significantly declined during the study period (P = .041). Of the neonates with MAS, 345 (29.7%) required mechanical ventilation, and 134 (11.53%) had pneumothoraxes. Among neonates with MAS, the requirement for mechanical ventilation, as well as the incidence of pneumothoraxes, did not decrease from 1973 through 1987. The incidence of MAS has declined since the advent of combined obstetric and pediatric suctioning of the oropharynx and trachea. Furthermore, there are significantly fewer deaths from the disorder. These declines were likely influenced by other improvements in perinatal care, which have occurred since the early 1970s. The results do not support the contention that severe MAS and resultant deaths can be prevented altogether.\r"

  ".W": "The blood pressure (BP) and transcutaneous PO2 (TcPO2) changes associated with intensive care procedures were evaluated to determine whether responses differ between babies with and without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH). Fifty-three inborn babies less than or equal to 1500 g were studied using a microcomputer-based monitoring system. With almost any procedure including a seemingly benign one such as a diaper change, peak systolic BP increased and TcPO2 decreased. However, responses to interventions did not differ between babies with PV-IVH and those without PV-IVH. Neither did these responses differ between those with birth weight less than or equal to 1000 g and greater than 1000 g. When each baby's record was scanned for the highest peak systolic BP before diagnosis of PV-IVH or within 48 hours in those with no PV-IVH and their BP points plotted against birth weight, a stable region was evident wherein PV-IVH occurred at a lower incidence (13%). When peak systolic BP was beyond this stable region, the incidence of PV-IVH was significantly higher, 70% (P less than .0001). The stability boundary for the maximum systolic BP is birth weight-dependent; the limit for the highest tolerable peak systolic BP is lower for the low-birth-weight infant. In over 70% of instances the highest peak systolic BP was associated with motor activities either induced by nursery procedures or spontaneous. We speculate that decreasing the frequency of intensive care interventions may decrease episodic BP increases to levels beyond the birth weight-dependent stability boundary where PV-IVH is likely to occur.\r"

Thus, thalamic hemorrhage appears to the most common source of intraventricular hemorrhage in this age group, particularly in infants who had uneventful birth histories and in whom clinical abnormalities (signs of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, altered level of consciousness) developed after the first week of life. The majority of these infants had predisposing factors for cerebral venous infarction such as sepsis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and coagulopathy. The clinical appearance and outcome for infants with thalamic hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage were similar to those in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage originating from other sites, except for an increased incidence of cerebral palsy in infants with thalamic hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage. Definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of characteristic radiologic abnormalities.\r"

In previous studies, an increased incidence has been documented of spontaneous abortion, placental abruption, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and neurologic deficits in the infants of women who abused cocaine. More recently, it has been suggested in studies that fetal vascular disruption accompanying maternal cocaine abuse may lead to cavitary central nervous system lesions and genitourinary anomalies. In this article, 10 children born of women who abused cocaine are described, 9 of whom have congenital limb reduction defects and/or intestinal atresia or infarction. The spectrum of anomalies associated with embryonic and fetal vascular disruption accompanying maternal cocaine abuse is thus enlarged. The specific risk for congenital anomalies accompanying maternal cocaine abuse during an individual pregnancy is unknown. However, data from these patients and the available literature suggest that counseling pregnant women concerning cocaine use should incorporate warnings about the possibility of associated embryonic or fetal vascular disruption.\r"

This increase in sleep time in the prone position could be largely accounted for by a tendency toward a decrease in crying time, 19 (0 to 82) vs 38.5 (0 to 91) minutes, P = .07, which is expressed further by the significantly smaller number of prone than seated infants who cried longer than 30 minutes, P = .02. A parallel reduction in noncrying awake time in the prone vs the seated position was not significant: 15 (0-51) vs 31 (3 to 84) minutes, P = .13.\r"

Responses were obtained from 107 of 130 institutions, and 94 of these had pulmonary function laboratories available. Of the 94, 60 used one of three reference standards. The primary reason the reference standards were chosen was either unknown or because they came with the spirometer (24), were recommended by another person or were those used in that person's training (34), or were thought to be the best standards available or most applicable to the population to be tested (31). To define abnormality, most used an 80% predicted cutoff for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% vital capacity. For a change in an individual through time, most used a 10% change for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% vital capacity. Thirteen used statistical methods to define abnormal individuals and none used statistical methods to define a significant change over time. Although there are a few guidelines for reference standards and interpretations of pulmonary function tests, it appears that most laboratories are not using those guidelines and that further guidelines and education are needed.\r"

Compared to the National Center for Health Statistics reference, the white girls and boys were of average height, Hispanic girls were of average height, and Hispanic boys were shorter than average. The black girls and boys were taller than average. In light of published evidence for black-white differences in the timing and duration of growth, we tentatively attributed this tall stature to advanced skeletal maturation of the black children relative to the predominantly white United States population growth standards. Underweight was virtually absent in this population. Excess overweight was noted in all sex-racial/ethnic subgroups, particularly among Hispanic children. However, the extent to which overweight (high weight-for-height percentile) represents obesity in kindergarten-aged children and in different racial/ethnic groups needs clarification before the implications of the finding of excess overweight can be fully understood. Overall, the growth of these children was on a par with the National Center for Health Statistics growth reference population.\r"

What characterizes the physicians who have adopted these innovations? And, what caused them to change their behavior and adopt the innovations? Three \"markers,\" recent innovation in medical practice, were chosen using an expert consensus technique. A telephone survey of 200 office-based pediatricians was conducted, and the physicians were asked whether or not they used the following three innovations in medical practice: continuous rather than intermittent phenobarbital for the prevention of febrile seizures, glycosylated hemoglobin measurement in the management of diabetes, and slow release theophylline in the management of asthma. The questionnaire was completed by 156 pediatricians. Of the 110 pediatricians who cared for diabetics, 73% used glycosylated hemoglobin measurement; of the 145 who saw patients with febrile seizures, 77% prescribed the continuous use of phenobarbital (if they used it at all); and, of the 152 pediatricians who cared for asthmatics, 86% reported using slow-release theophylline. The characteristics significantly associated with using the innovations were board certification, group rather than solo practice, teaching, medically related publications, academic appointment, younger age, and caring for a greater number of patients per week. For two of the innovations, discussion with a colleague was the most important source of information leading to a change of practice. The subjects cited local specialists as the colleagues who most often sparked the adoption of an innovation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of eligibility criteria on phototherapy program size and cost, 786 births in a large Health Maintenance Organization were prospectively studied. Four sets of criteria were compared, including those of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the health maintenance organization's own criteria. With all criteria sets, hospital-based phototherapy treatment was indicated for 13 (1.7%) infants and no phototherapy was indicated for 687 (87.4%) infants. Treatment varied substantially according to criteria set for the remaining 86 (10.9%) infants. From 14% to 100% of these infants would have received treatment, depending on the criteria applied; of those potentially treated, from 30% to 80% would have received home treatment. Estimated annual discretionary phototherapy costs (1985 dollars) ranged from $15,168 with the health maintenance organization criteria to almost five to six times this amount ($70,232 to $90,800) with the other criteria. Differences in costs were due mainly to the number of infants treated. This study illustrates the way in which modest variation in standards of care can potentially have a relatively large effect on medical care costs. As a case study of how health maintenance organizations reduce costs, the study shows that although the health maintenance organization anticipated costs savings due to substituting outpatient care for hospital care, most savings occurred because of a reduction in the number of infants treated.\r"

Mothers of 129 infants, who had completed the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire at the 4-month visit, completed the Child Behavior Checklist when the child was 6 years of age. Teachers of 102 of these children completed the teacher Child Behavior Checklist. Temperamental difficulty was defined by assessments of rhythmicity, approach/withdrawal, intensity, mood, and adaptability. Initial analyses revealed that low socioeconomic status (r = -.29, P = .001), ratings of temperamental difficulty (r = .17, P = .06), and perceptions of temperamental difficulty (r = .22, P = .02) at 4 months of age were associated with increased maternal rating of behavior problems at 6 years of age (all 2-tailed tests). However, a multivariate regression analysis showed only low socioeconomic status (P less than .01) and increased perceptions of temperamental difficulty (P = .02) associated with maternal behavior problem scores. Teacher behavior problem scores were associated only with low socioeconomic status (r = -.27, P = .01). These results suggest that the link between difficult infant temperament and later behavior problems is complex and probably reflects both child factors and parent attitudes about what constitutes typical infant behavior.\r"

A chart review and follow-up telephone survey were done to gather information concerning patients admitted for postneonatal circumcision to two Salt Lake City hospitals during a 2-year period. From the 135 patients eligible for analysis, two distinct groups emerged: the \"sick\" group (n = 52)--those who had neonatal complications, and the \"well\" group (n = 83)--those with no neonatal complications. The median age at circumcision was 5.5 months for the boys in the sick group and 35 months for the boys in the well group (P less than .001, Student's t test). During the neonatal period, 32% of families in the well group received anticircumcision advice from their primary care physician. The decision in favor of circumcision was made by two thirds of the families of sick infants before their sons were 6 weeks of age. Other surgery was performed concurrent with the circumcision in 44% of patients in the sick group and 24% of patients in the well group (P less than .0001, chi 2). Balanitis, phimosis, or a physician's recommendation were listed as the primary reason for post-neonatal circumcision by 50% of patents in the well group. Phimosis was listed by the surgeon as an indication for postneonatal circumcision in 65% of all patients' charts, although only 13% of parents listed phimosis as an indication for their children's circumcision.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The result of a pilot screening instrument for depression and parent-teenager conflict is described. A seven-item questionnaire (three items for depression and four items for parent-teenager conflict), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), were administered to 226 adolescents at a high-risk adolescent heath center. After the visit, the provider rated each patient on a five-point Likert scale for level of depression and parent-teenager conflict. The screening questionnaire and the provider ratings were compared with the BDI and CBQ for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. A majority of the subjects (61% for depression and 63% for parent-teenager conflict) had no positive screening responses and, of these, less than 3% were classified as being depressed or having parent-teenager conflict by the BDI or CBQ. There were three or four positive screening responses (three responses for the depression questions and 20 responses for the parent-teenager conflict questions) among 23 adolescents and all of these scored in the abnormal range on the BDI or CBQ. Approximately one third of the subjects had intermediate responses. With one positive response, the predictive value for depression and parent-teenager conflict was 17% and 24%, respectively, whereas with two positive responses the predictive values were 56% and 26%. It was shown by receiver operating characteristic curves that the combined sensitivity and specificity of the screening questionnaire was superior to that of the physician ratings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration is a form of renal replacement therapy whereby small molecular weight solutes and water are removed from the blood via convection, alleviating fluid overload and, to a degree, azotemia. It has been used in many adults and several children. However, in patients with multisystem organ dysfunction and acute renal failure, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration alone may not be sufficient for control of azotemia; intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be undesirable in such unstable patients. Recently, the technique of continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration has been used in many severely ill adults. We have used continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration in four patients at Children's Hospital Medical Center. Patient 1 suffered perinatal asphyxia and oliguria while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients 2 and 4 both had Burkitt lymphoma and tumor lysis syndrome. Patient 3 had septic shock several months after a bone marrow transplant. All had acute renal failure and contraindications to hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. A blood pump was used in three of the four patients, while spontaneous arterial flow was adequate in one. Continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration was performed for varying lengths of time, from 11 hours to 7 days. No patient had worsening of cardiovascular status or required increased pressor support during continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration. The two survivors (patients 2 and 4) eventually recovered normal renal function. Continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration is a safe and effective means of renal replacement therapy in the critically ill child. It may be ideal for control of the metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities of the tumor lysis syndrome.\r"

Ten children had appendicitis, four of whom had perforated their appendix at the time of surgery. Children with appendicitis differed from children without appendicitis in the incidence of right lower quadrant rebound tenderness (60% vs 17.4%), and white blood cell count (X10(3)/mm3) (14.0 + 1.9 vs 10.7 +/- 1.0). TAC-WBC scans were interpreted as either positive, negative, or indeterminate for appendiceal pathology. Twenty-five children had positive or negative scans for appendiceal pathology. There were 7 true positives, 2 false positives, 16 true negatives, and 0 false negatives. This resulted in a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 89%, an accuracy of 92%, a positive predictive value of 78%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in eight children (24%), three of whom had appendicitis. The main values of TAC-WBC scan in our study of children with possible appendicitis were that it could be used emergently, it was abnormal in 100% of children with appendicitis, and it had a high negative predictive value (100%). The main limitation of TAC-WBC scan in our study was that it was indeterminate for appendiceal pathology in 24% of children. We recommend that TAC-WBC scan be used in children with possible appendicitis because it may allow outpatient management of up to 48%.\r"

Unlike Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum is relatively aerotolerant and thus appears to be more capable of initiating infection in the absence of obvious damage to tissues. Six cases illustrate the clinical setting and fulminant nature of spontaneous gangrene caused by C. septicum. A lesion in the colon such as carcinoma is often present and is presumed to serve as a portal of entry to the bloodstream. Diabetes and leukopenia are also common predisposing conditions; compromise of vital host responses may facilitate proliferation of those organisms that settle out in the tissues. Acute lymphoma or leukemia during a course of chemotherapy is accompanied by damage to bowel mucosa and granulocytopenia, thus predisposing to spontaneous clostridial gangrene. Infection progresses in a fulminating manner; the majority of patients die within 24 hours of onset. Characteristic symptoms and signs include excruciating pain (although a sense of heaviness may be the only early symptom), swelling of tissues, crepitance, and bulla formation. A hallmark of C. septicum infection is the absence of acute inflammatory cells in involved tissues or in bulla fluid. A series of laboratory investigations demonstrated that fluid obtained from a bulla adversely affected the viability, morphology, and function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which may explain the paucity of PMNs in involved tissues and may in part contribute to the fulminant progression observed in infection due to this organism.\r"

The median age of these 16 patients was 4.7 years, and their illness was characterized by fever (13 of 16 patients), coagulopathy (10 of 16), lower respiratory tract disease (10 of 16), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (five of 16) in addition to clinical evidence of hepatitis. The adenoviruses isolated were the commonly found serotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 for 13 of the 15 cases for which this determination was available. With the high frequency of adenovirus infection in humans and the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in children, it seems likely that this syndrome will continue to be seen.\r"

The colony was established to study social behavior in monkey families; consequently, animals range freely over more than 59 acres. During the past 6 years, there have been six documented cases of coccidioidomycosis. In addition, there have been six probable cases and five possible cases. Disease was progressive in all monkeys and was characterized by cough, wasting, and the appearance of draining cutaneous abscesses. Untreated, monkeys usually died within several months. Fourteen monkeys were treated with oral fluconazole; eight improved rapidly, and the others had no response. Four of the monkeys that improved relapsed quickly after fluconazole treatment was interrupted. Two monkeys showed initial improvement, relapsed when fluconazole treatment was interrupted, and again improved when fluconazole treatment was resumed. The present studies suggest that fluconazole may be effective treatment in primates with coccidioidomycosis and that euthanasia is no longer necessary. However, prolonged treatment is necessary, and relapses may occur.\r"

Although fluconazole appeared less active than ketoconazole in vitro, in experiments involving 3 weeks of treatment and 2 months of observation, fluconazole was greater than 10 times as potent (mg/kg) in vivo against blastomycosis (prolongation of life). In the model neither drug was curative at the doses and regimens used. A possible explanation for the efficacy of fluconazole in vivo is its favorable pharmacokinetic profile (i.e., prolonged serum concentrations that exceeded the MIC for the pathogen after oral administration). Dosages of 100 mg/(kg.d) were tolerated for 3 weeks without evident toxicity.\r"

The coadministration of cyclosporin A with a low dose of fluconazole (100 mg) was not associated with significant changes in the minimal and the maximal plasma concentrations of cyclosporin A. While higher doses of fluconazole (200 mg) did not affect endogenous steroids, coadministration resulted in changes in the pharmacodynamics of warfarin and the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin and cyclosporin A.\r"

Patients were treated with 200 mg/day, a dosage that could be increased to 400 mg/d if the initial response was not satisfactory. AIDS was the underlying risk factor in 65% of 232 patients evaluated in the study and in 85% of 151 patients with cryptococcal infection. Fifty-eight patients had active cryptococcal infection; 74% had a satisfactory clinical response, and 75% of 44 patients became culture-negative. Patients with inactive infection had a relapse rate of 4.5/1,000 patient-weeks. Twenty-three of 30 patients with coccidioidal infection and 10 of 14 patients with candidiasis or another mycosis were clinically improved. Five patients (2%) discontinued fluconazole therapy because of adverse effects possibly attributable to therapy. Fluconazole may be effective in the treatment of serious fungal infections in patients who cannot continue conventional antifungal therapy.\r"

Five (63%) of eight assessable patients receiving fluconazole as sole therapy responded or partially responded. Two patients discontinued fluconazole after initially responding to therapy, and both experienced relapse. The toxicity of fluconazole remains minimal at doses to 400 mg/d. The penetration of fluconazole into cerebrospinal fluid is substantial at all doses studied. Thus fluconazole continues to show promise even as sole therapy against coccidioidal meningitis. Not all patients respond, however, and relapse may be a problem with the currently studied doses and durations of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Light-dependent expression of rbcS, the gene encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, which is the key enzyme involved in carbon fixation in higher plants, is regulated at the transcriptional level. Sequence analysis of the gene has uncovered a conserved GT motif in the -150 to -100 region of many rbcS promoters. This motif serves as the binding site of a nuclear factor, designated GT-1. Analysis of site-specific mutants of pea rbcS-3A promoter demonstrated that GT-1 binding in vitro is correlated with light-responsive expression of the rbcS promoter in transgenic plants. However, it is not known whether factors other than GT-1 might also be required for activation of transcription by light. A synthetic tetramer of box II (TGTGTGGTTAATATG), the GT-1 binding site located between -152 to -138 of the rbcS-3A promoter, inserted upstream of a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter is sufficient to confer expression in leaves of transgenic tobacco. This expression occurs principally in chloroplast-containing cells, is induced by light, and is correlated with the ability of box II to bind GT-1 in vitro. The data show that the binding site for GT-1 is likely to be a part of the molecular light switch for rbcS activation.\r"

NtrC binds to sites upstream of glnA that have properties of eukaryotic transcriptional enhancers. NtrC-binding sites were found to facilitate open complex formation when these sites and the glnA promoter were located on different rings of a singly linked catenane, but not when the two rings were decatenated. The results provide evidence that NtrC contacts RNA polymerase-promoter complexes in a process mediated by formation of a DNA loop. NtrC-binding sites serve to tether NtrC near the glnA promoter, thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between NtrC and polymerase-promoter complexes.\r"

Eleven of the patients presented with hemorrhage, four with seizures, and one with hydrocephalus. There were no maternal or fetal deaths in the patients presenting with seizure or hydrocephalus. There were two maternal deaths and one fetal death among the cases presenting with hemorrhage. In the patients with seizure or hydrocephalus, the pregnancy was brought to term and obstetric indications used to determine the time and method of delivery. Hydrocephalus was treated by shunting, and seizures with medication. Antiepileptic drug levels fluctuate in pregnancy and hence were closely monitored to ensure therapeutic levels. Vascular malformations are the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage in pregnancy. The risk of rebleed in the same pregnancy is about 27%. If an arteriovenous malformation ruptures during pregnancy and the patient's condition deteriorates, appropriate emergency surgery should be done. In stable patients, our policy has been to bring the pregnancy to term and then electively perform a craniotomy to excise the arteriovenous malformation.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with cryptococcal meningitis were reviewed. All patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. Early recognitions and prompt relief of hydrocephalus were useful for eight patients who showed rapid deterioration of consciousness or signs of cerebral herniation. There was no surgical response in four patients who had had weeks of confusion or mental change. It seems, therefore, that the duration of disturbance of consciousness or change of mentality before shunting is critical in determination of the outcome of the treatment. Ventricular shunting was effective in relieving papilledema in five patients. However, the surgery did not prevent the development of papilledema to optic atrophy and subsequent blindness in two patients. Hence, in addition to hydrocephalus with increased intracranial pressure, conditions such as direct invasion of the optic pathways by Cryptococcus neoformans or optochiasmatic arachnoiditis may be responsible for the visual failure. Ventricular shunting was also helpful in restoring paraparesis in one patient. Of the cerebrospinal fluid determinations, low protein concentration was a favorable indicator for surgery. Of the seven patients who received the surgical procedure before the start of antifungal therapy, four showed a significant improvement despite active infection of the central nervous system. None of the seven patients deteriorated because of the surgical operation. Thus, active stage of cryptococcal meningitis does not contraindicate the necessity of shunting, and premedication with antifungal drugs is unnecessary. Also, no shunt-related morbidity and mortality was seen in this study.\r"

  ".U": "90232460\r", 
  ".W": "A previous New Zealand case-control study of asthma deaths in the 5-45 year age group during 1981-3 found that prescription of fenoterol (by metered dose inhaler) was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with severe asthma. One major criticism of this study was that drug data for the cases and controls came from different sources. A new case-control design has been used to evaluate the same hypothesis, with a different set of asthma deaths, the same source for drug information being used for both cases and controls. This depended on identifying deaths from asthma during 1977-81 from national mortality records, and ascertaining which patients from those who died had been admitted to a major hospital for asthma during the 12 months before death. The study was confined to this subgroup, which accounted for about 20% of all asthma deaths in the areas served by a major hospital. For each of the eligible patients who died four age matched controls were selected from patients admitted to hospital for asthma during the year that the death occurred who had also had an admission for asthma in the previous 12 months. For the 58 cases and 227 control subjects information on prescribed drugs was collected from the hospital records relating to the previous admission. The odds ratio of asthma death in patients prescribed inhaled fenoterol was 1.99 (95% confidence interval 1.12-3.55, p = 0.02). As in the previous study, subgroups defined by markers of chronic asthma severity were also considered. The inhaled fenoterol odds ratio was 2.98 (95% CI 1.15-7.70, p = 0.02) in patients prescribed three or more categories of asthma drugs, 3.91 (95% CI 1.79-8.54, p less than 0.01) in patients with a previous admission for asthma in the past 12 months, and 5.83 (95% CI 1.62-21.0, p = 0.01) in patients prescribed oral corticosteroids at the time of admission. In patients with the most severe asthma (defined by a previous admission for asthma during the past 12 months and prescribed oral corticosteroids at time of admission) the inhaled fenoterol odds ratio was 9.82 (95% CI 2.23-43.4, p less than 0.01). These findings add further support to the hypothesis that inhaled fenoterol increases the risk of death in patients with severe asthma.\r"

  ".W": "New Zealand has higher mortality and hospital admission rates for asthma than England and Wales. To determine the reasons for this the available data on asthma mortality and hospital admissions from the Auckland region of New Zealand were compared with data from the South West Thames Region of England for 1979-86 and data from previous surveys on prevalence of wheeze (Auckland 1985, Croydon 1978). In addition, a survey of general practitioners was carried out to determine their approach to the management of asthma, patient simulations being used. Asthma mortality in children of European descent aged 5-14 years was 2.5 times higher in Auckland than in South West Thames. The reported lifetime, 12 month, and one month prevalences of wheeze were also higher in Auckland (by 18.5%, 32.1%, and 87.5%). Unexpectedly, the hospital admission rate for asthma in children of European descent aged 5-14 years was 5% less in Auckland than in South West Thames. Comparative studies of hospital case notes and of the replies from general practitioners showed that in Auckland the duration of illness before admission was greater and that general practitioners were less likely to admit patients with acute asthma. The overall standard of general practitioner care in Auckland was, if anything, higher than in South West Thames but in both areas there was considerable variation. On balance it was concluded that the higher mortality rate in New Zealand is explained by higher levels of morbidity rather than relative deficiencies in care. Nevertheless, the implications of the lesser use of hospital care for acute asthma observed in Auckland need further consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Spirometry before and after an inhaled beta agonist or a course of oral prednisolone is widely used to detect reversible airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. How many of these patients have a response and how the response to beta agonists relates to the response to corticosteroids is not clear. In 127 outpatients (mean (SD) FEV1 0.92 (0.38) 1) who had a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease (continuous breathlessness for more than six months and an FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio less than 60%) and who appeared to be stable, the change in FEV1 was measured after salbutamol 200 micrograms from a metered dose inhaler and 5 mg from a nebuliser. Symptoms and spirometric values were recorded before and after two weeks of oral prednisolone 30 mg. Reversibility was defined as a response in FEV1 of 15% or more from baseline alone and as a 15% change and a minimum increase of at least 200 ml. The latter gave results that showed greater internal consistency between the drug regimens. On the basis of this criterion 56 patients (44%) had no response to salbutamol or prednisolone, 71 responded to salbutamol (including all 27 steroid responders), and 25 patients had a response to salbutamol 5 mg but not to 200 micrograms. In general, the largest increase in FEV1 after salbutamol occurred in the subjects with greatest improvement after prednisolone. Subjects showing a response in FEV1 after two weeks' prednisolone had a fall in total symptom score, unlike those who had no response to any treatment or a response to salbutamol only. These data show that reversibility in response to beta agonists is common in patients diagnosed on clinical grounds as having stable chronic obstructive lung disease, that it can be substantial, and that it is best detected by using a larger dose of salbutamol. Salbutamol responders were those most likely to improve after a trial of oral prednisolone. Allowance should be made for the variability of FEV1 in the calculation of the percentage response at low baseline values (less than 1 litre).\r"

Bronchial responsiveness to histamine administered by tidal breathing was therefore compared with that produced with a dosimeter in 25 children with asthma aged 5-18 years. Bronchial responsiveness was defined as the concentration of histamine that caused a 40% rise in pulmonary resistance (PC40) measured by random noise forced oscillation at 6 Hz. Values of PC40 measured by the tidal breathing method were lower than those obtained with the dosimeter method, presumably owing to differences in the dose administered and variations in the pattern of breathing. The difference between the two methods was not related to age, however. It is concluded that the tidal breathing and the dosimeter methods are both suitable for the measurement of bronchial responsiveness in children of various ages and that both can be used in longitudinal studies.\r"

There was an increase in cough threshold (decrease in cough sensitivity) in response to both inhaled irritants on the first postoperative day from the preoperative day and a return towards preoperative values by the fourth day after surgery. The increase in cough threshold on the first postoperative day correlated with the time since opiate administration (r = 0.7 for capsaicin, 0.52 for citric acid). These results show that the threshold concentration of chemical irritants causing cough is increased on the first postoperative day after upper abdominal surgery.\r"

To quantify the extent of the hypoperfused zone, Tc-99m- or In-111-albumin microspheres were injected into the left atrium 1 minute after occlusion. Fifteen minutes after occlusion, dogs were randomly assigned to a control group or a gallopamil-treated group that received immediately after assignment 0.08 mg/kg of gallopamil followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/hr for 6 hours. Six or 24 hours after occlusion, the left ventricle was cut into 3 mm thick slices for triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and autoradiography. There were no differences in the extent of the hypoperfused zone among the four groups. In both protocols 1 and 2 the ratio of the extent of myocardial necrosis to the extent of the hypoperfused zone was significantly smaller in the treated groups (56.7 +/- 6.7% [n = 8], p less than 0.01 and 72.3 +/- 5.3% [n = 6], p less than 0.05 for protocols 1 and 2, respectively) than in the control groups (100.7 +/- 6.0% [n = 7] and 95.2 +/- 4.3% [n = 5] for protocols I and II, respectively). Thus gallopamil administered early after coronary artery occlusion had beneficial effects on the ischemic myocardium, which were sustained for at least 24 hours after the onset of infarction.\r"

Fourteen patients had late-onset advanced AV block, and 87 patients were free of AV block. The hospital mortality rate was 11%. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the important variables associated with the occurrence of late advanced AV block and hospital mortality rates based on 12 clinical variables. Colloid osmotic pressure, right atrial pressure, serum potassium level, and number of segments with advanced asynergy were the significant factors associated with the occurrence of late advanced AV block, whereas advanced asynergic segments and alveolar arterial oxygen difference were important in the consideration of hospital mortality rates. Therefore not only the extent of myocardial ischemia but also the increases in the extracellular potassium level and interstitial fluid are some of the factors that are associated with the occurrence of late advanced AV block in acute inferior MI. Late advanced AV block, in itself, has no significant influence on hospital mortality rates.\r"

The critical sites for prevention of the initiation of reentry and for termination of sustained figure-of-8 reentrant tachycardia by cryothermal techniques were correlated with the last 20 msec isochrone during sinus rhythm. In 12 experiments, 20 critical sites were examined. The mean distance between sites critical for reentry and the latest isochrone during sinus rhythm was 26.7 +/- 13.3 mm. Only five sites (25%) were within a 12 mm distance, which corresponded to the diameter of the cryoprobe. Nine sites (45%) were within a 24 mm distance (twice the diameter of the cryoprobe), while 11 sites (55%) were separated by more than 24 mm. In three experiments the sites of latest activation during sinus rhythm represented areas showing Wenckebach period or 2:1 conduction block. These sites became dissociated and did not participate in the reentrant excitation induced by premature stimulation. Poor correlation was explained by the fact that sites critical for reentry were intimately related to the location and extent of the arcs of functional conduction block while sites of delayed activation during sinus rhythm were not.\r"

  ".W": "Radionuclide angiography was used to study the hemodynamic effects of intravenous procainamide during stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. In four patients studied without procainamide, the ejection fraction was 25% +/- 2.4% during normal sinus rhythm, dropped to 11.3% +/- 2.2% (p less than 0.05) at the onset of ventricular tachycardia, increased to 16.7% +/- 1.7% after remaining in ventricular tachycardia for 10 minutes, and returned to 25.3% +/- 3.7% in sinus rhythm. In the 10 study patients, ejection fraction dropped from 36% +/- 5.8% in sinus rhythm to 25% +/- 5.1% in ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.2). Ejection fraction decreased further (23% +/- 5.0%) following low doses of procainamide (140 +/- 52 mg) despite cycle length prolongation (354 +/- 18 msec versus 373 +/- 21 msec, p less than 0.5). In 8 of 10 patients, there was a progressive increase in the ejection fraction (28.8% +/- 4.1%). Ventricular tachycardia onset also resulted in a decrease in cardiac output and end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. Two patients who tolerated procainamide in sinus rhythm showed hemodynamic collapse secondary to procainamide during ventricular tachycardia. We conclude that in some patients hemodynamic intolerance to an antiarrhythmic drug may only become evident during ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Eleven pigs had myocardial infarction induced by pulling snares previously placed around the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Six days after occlusion, bipolar pacing catheters were inserted in the right ventricular apex for induction of VT. Testing was repeated in conscious pigs on 6 out of 8 to 19 days after infarction. Monomorphic VT was induced in each animal during each session, using three to four extrastimuli. VT was terminated by burst pacing in 74% of trials; average VT rate was 362 +/- 26 beats/min. VT was prevented in four of eight animals by procainamide and in five of eight animals by magnesium, but was not prevented by lidocaine or metoprolol. The model may be useful in the study of potentially malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, important prodromes for sudden death.\r"

  ".U": "90233135\r", 
  ".W": "Electrophysiologic effects of barucainide hydrochloride on the transmembrane potentials of isolated canine and rabbit cardiac muscle were investigated by means of a standard microelectrode technique. Barucainide (10(-6) to 3.0 x 10(-5) mol/L) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) in canine Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle. Tonic block of Vmax was small and negligible. Barucainide produced marked use-dependent block (UDB). The onset rate of UDB and the speed of recovery from UDB were comparable to those of disopyramide. The recovery time constant was 8.0 +/- 0.8 seconds. Membrane depolarization induced by high concentrations of potassium enhanced the inhibitory action of barucainide on Vmax. The enhancement of tonic block was much greater than that of UDB indicating a selective effectiveness of the drug in pathologically depolarized tissues. Barucainide produced marked shortening of the action potential duration (APD), which indicates that barucainide exerts class Ib antiarrhythmic effects. Such shortening effects on the APD were not affected by pretreatment with 1 mmol/L cobalt or with 0.5 mmol/L 4-aminopyridine. In contrast, barucainide had no marked effects on the APD in the presence of 4.0 x 10(-5) mol/L lidocaine, although it produced almost the same extent of Vmax inhibition as did barucainide alone. Frequency of the pacemaker activity in the rabbit sinoatrial tissue and of the automaticity at normal resting potential in Purkinje fibers enhanced by 2.0 X 10(-6) mol/L isoproterenol were significantly suppressed by barucainide. However, barucainide up to 3.0 x 10(-5) mol/L failed to suppress the firing frequency of the abnormal automaticity in canine Purkinje fibers induced by 5 mmol/L barium. These overall findings indicate that barucainide is a novel class Ib antiarrhythmic agent which, unlike other Ib agents, has a slow kinetic property. However, the precise significance of this unique electrophysiologic feature with respect to the antiarrhythmic action of the drug is not known but provides the basis for understanding the relationship of electrophysiologic effects of barucainide in vitro and its potential antiarrhythmic actions in experimental animals and in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical experience has shown that the antiarrhythmic effect of lidocaine on atrial arrhythmias, and specifically for the conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, is minimal. This study summarizes our experience in 30 dogs in which atrial fibrillation was initiated and sustained (greater than or equal to 15 minutes) under increased vagal tone achieved by either alpha-chloralose anesthesia (26 dogs) or pentobarbital sodium anesthesia combined with direct external electrical vagal stimulation (four dogs). Under increased vagal tone (regardless of the procedure), an intravenous bolus of lidocaine (2 to 3 mg/kg) was 100% effective (101 of 101 episodes) in pharmacologically converting atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. This was associated with marked slowing of intra-atrial electrical activity, as shown by fast Fourier analysis of intra-atrial electrograms. Over a period of 3 to 5 minutes, lidocaine progressively shifted the peak frequency content from 84 +/- 18 mV2/Hz in the 10 to 20 Hz frequency band during the pre-lidocaine phase to 110 +/- 34 mV2/Hz in the 0 to 10 Hz frequency band immediately prior to conversion to normal sinus rhythm. When atropine was administered or electrical vagal stimulation was discontinued, the conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm followed a similar electrophysiologic pattern. When isoproterenol was infused, it was difficult to induce atrial fibrillation; when the arrhythmia was initiated, it could not be sustained even with concomitant electrical vagal stimulation. Thus in this model of parasympathetically sustained atrial fibrillation, lidocaine was 100% effective in converting atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Elderly normal subjects have an increased prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias compared with young and middle-aged subjects. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the incidence and complexity of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may be related to either left atrial enlargement or to increased left ventricular mass, respectively. From 146 asymptomatic volunteers older than 60 years, 86 subjects were considered to be free of cardiovascular abnormalities and had adequate M-mode echocardiograms and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms. The mean age was 72 +/- 7 years, with a range of 60 to 96 years. There were 37 men and 49 women. During 1415 +/- 73 minutes of ambulatory electrocardiography, the average heart rate was 72 +/- 8 beats/min in men and 76 +/- 6 beats/min in women (p less than 0.05). Atrial arrhythmias were present in 64 subjects (74%); the frequency and complexity of these arrhythmias correlated with left atrial size (p less than 0.01). Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 55 subjects (64%); the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias did not correlate with left ventricular mass index. These results suggest that left atrial dilatation, a normal development in healthy elderly subjects, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of the increased incidence of atrial arrhythmias. Increased left ventricular mass, which also occurs normally in the aging heart, is not, on the other hand, associated with an increased frequency and/or complexity of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

The effects of this pacing mode on the intact, immature heart, however, are largely unknown. Twelve beagle puppies (age 3 to 4 months) were equally divided into paced and age-matched control groups. All underwent identical hemodynamic and electrophysiologic evaluations. Transepicardial atrioventricular block and pacemaker insertion were additionally carried out in the paced group. After 4 months of observation, repeat hemodynamic and electrophysiologic measurements followed by histopathologic examinations were done in all puppies. The paced group exhibited significant (p less than 0.05) elevations of right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, alterations in sinus node function, and prolongation of ventricular refractory periods compared with the control group. Initiation of dysrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation was observed only among the paced group of puppies. Histologic examination demonstrated myofibrillar cellular disarray, dystrophic calcifications, prominent subendocardial Purkinje cells, and an increase in variable-sized, disorganized mitochondria only in the paced specimens. These findings indicate that permanent, apically-initiated VVI pacing ultimately predisposes to adverse cellular changes associated with hemodynamic and electrophysiologic deterioration in the intact, developing immature canine heart.\r"

Sixty-two studies were performed in four different intensive care units on 61 patients with a mean age of 58 +/- 14 years (range 25 to 78 years). Indications for the study included suspected aortic pathologic conditions (18 patients), cardiac source of embolus (16 patients), postmyocardial infarction complications (6 patients), and suspected infective endocarditis (5 patients). Studies were performed at bedside with the use of small amounts of intravenous sedatives. The probe was passed successfully in 61 of 62 attempts. Diagnoses that were missed by surface echocardiography, including aortic dissection, left atrial thrombus, ruptured papillary muscle, and prosthetic valve vegetation were clearly identified by transesophageal echocardiography, which facilitated appropriate management in these cases. In cases in which no pathologic condition was identified, transesophageal echocardiography was useful in ruling out intracardiac shunt, in assessing left ventricular function, and in excluding significant valvular pathologic conditions. No serious complications were recorded, and the procedure was, in general, very well tolerated.\r"

The patients were divided into four groups. Group 1 included 14 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, among whom four cases of intracavitary thrombi were detected. Group 2 included 13 patients with acute or previous myocardial infarction, and left ventricular thrombi were detected in three. Group 3 included one patient with a prosthetic mechanical aortic valve and one with mitral valve prolapse; thrombi were not detected in either. Group 4 comprised 13 patients with no clinical evidence of a cardiac source of embolism; in one of them a large left ventricular thrombus was detected. Altogether eight intracavitary thrombi were detected (19%), and only in three (7.1%) were the results of echocardiographic examinations defined as entirely normal. A number of clinically undetected cardiac lesions, such as mitral annular calcification and aortic valve calcification, possibly associated with peripheral arterial embolism, were also detected by postoperative echocardiography. Because of the high percentage of intracavitary thrombi detected and the therapeutic implications thereof, especially if embolism recurred, it is concluded that two-dimensional echocardiographic examination should be recommended for patients with acute peripheral embolism.\r"

  ".W": "Few data exist regarding the relationship of valvular anatomy and coaptation to the presence of mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Therefore this study was undertaken to assess the ability of two-dimensional echocardiographic features of mitral valve morphology to predict the presence, direction, and magnitude of MR as assessed by color Doppler flow imaging. MR was present in 21 of 46 patients with MVP on two-dimensional echocardiography. Echocardiograms were specifically evaluated for leaflet apposition, leaflet morphology, and mitral anulus diameter. Color flow images were analyzed for presence of MR, direction of the regurgitant jet, and area encompassing the largest jet visible in any view. Abnormal mitral leaflet coaptation on two-dimensional echocardiography was strongly associated with the presence of MR (p = 0.003), being present in 15 of 21 patients with as compared with 5 of 25 patients without MR. Similarly, mitral leaflet thickness and MR were closely associated (p = 0.0035), with the latter being present in 9 of 30 patients with normal and 12 of 16 patients with excessive leaflet thickness. MR jet direction tended to be anterior to central with posterior leaflet prolapse and posterior or central with anterior leaflet prolapse (p = 0.02). Maximal jet area of MR tended to be larger in patients with compared with those without mitral annular dilatation (5.4 +/- 2.3 versus 2.1 +/- 1.9 cm2, p = 0.001), and in those with abnormal rather than normal leaflet thickness (4.5 +/- 2.7 versus 2.0 +/- 1.6 cm2, p = 0.009). Thus the presence, direction, and size of MR jets in MVP are related to structural abnormality of the mitral apparatus on echocardiography.\r"

The subpulmonary region, main pulmonary artery, right and left pulmonary arteries, and aorticopulmonary shunts were clearly visualized by means of NMR imaging in all patients. Angiography defined the subpulmonary region and main pulmonary artery in all patients, the right and left pulmonary arteries along their length in 11 of 12 patients, and aorticopulmonary shunts in seven of eight patients. Except for the right pulmonary artery, echocardiography defined the remaining structures in less than or equal to 50% of patients. Measurement of the pulmonary artery diameters on NMR images correlated well with the angiographic measurements of both the left (r = 0.96) and right (r = 0.94) pulmonary arteries. These results suggest that NMR imaging may be the preferable noninvasive imaging technique for defining the anatomy of the subpulmonary region, main and left pulmonary arteries, and aorticopulmonary shunts in older patients with congenital cardiovascular disease and that it compares well with the angiographic standard.\r"

The best variables for predicting long-term mortality included underlying coronary artery disease, basal systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, presence of congestion on chest radiogram, and age over 64. Other variables did not improve risk prediction in the overall group. Among patients with ischemic heart disease, blood pressure, congestion, maximal heart rate on treadmill test, and the presence of left bundle branch block on the initial electrocardiogram all contributed. Only systolic blood pressure and the symptom score were related to survival in idiopathic cardiomyopathy.\r"

By means of equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA), ejection fraction (EF), peak ejection rate (PER) in end-diastolic volume (EDV/sec) and peak filling rate (PFR) in EDV/sec and stroke volume (SV/sec) units, PFR/PER ratio, and time to peak filling rate (TPFR) in milliseconds were computed at rest and during exercise (n = 35). Left ventricular response to exercise was assessed as delta EF, relative delta EF, delta EDV, and delta ESV. In normal subjects the PM ratios showed significant inverse correlation with PER at rest and with EF, PER, and PFRedv during exercise. For the left ventricular response to exercise, delta ESV showed significant correlation with the PM ratios. The body surface area-corrected pulmonary uptake values showed no correlation with any of the variables. In patients with CAD the PM ratios and Pc uptake showed significant inverse correlation with EF, PER, PFRedv and to exercise EF, exercise PER, and exercise PFRedv. For the left ventricular response to exercise, delta EF showed significant inverse correlation with the PM ratios but not with the Pc uptake. Neither in normal subjects nor in patients with CAD did any of the independent diastolic variables show significant correlation with the PM ratios or Pc values. Thus pulmonary thallium uptake is correlated with systolic left ventricular function at rest and during exercise in normal subjects and in patients with CAD but not with diastolic function. In normal subjects delta ESV and in patients with CAD, delta EF showed correlation with pulmonary thallium uptake.\r"

Echocardiographic indices of dilatation (left ventricular end-diastolic volume and diameter) were significantly (p less than 0.01 to less than 0.001) correlated (negative correlations) with derivatives of HR monitoring (mean HR values, mainly during the night) but not with BP derivatives. It is concluded that in essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy depends on mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP values, whereas left ventricular dilatation appears to be more prominent in patients with bradycardia mainly during the night.\r"

Of the 1104 five-millimeter segments in the 32 patients dying as a consequence of myocardial ischemia, 291 (26%) were narrowed more than 75% in cross-sectional area by plaque; in contrast, of the 761 five-millimeter segments of veins in the 21 patients with a noncardiac mode of death, 86 (11%) were narrowed more than 75% by plaque. Of the total 1865 five-millimeter segments of vein, only 395 (21%) were narrowed 25% or less in cross-sectional area by plaque. Thus, in patients dying late after coronary bypass the atherosclerotic process continues in all segments of the saphenous veins used as aortocoronary conduits. Therapy after the operation must be directed toward prevention of progression of the atherosclerosis in the \"new\" coronary \"arteries.\"\r"

In this study we analyzed the effect of gemfibrozil therapy on the incidences of Q wave and non-Q wave infarctions, since the long-term prognoses of these two types of myocardial infarction may be different. The analyses indicated a 45% reduction (P less than 0.02, log-rank test) in the cumulative incidence of Q wave infarctions in the gemfibrozil group without a statistically significant effect on either the rate of non-Q wave infarctions or of coronary deaths. The reduction in the incidence of Q wave infarctions became evident during the second half of the 5-year study period.\r"

The overall percentage of patients with AF complicating acute MI was 16.0%; this proportion increased over time from 13.3% in 1975 to 14.8% in 1978, 14.9% in 1981, 20.3% in 1984, and to 17.7% in 1986. Patients with AF experienced consistently higher in-hospital case fatality rates than MI patients without AF overall (27.6% versus 16.6%), as well as during each of the 5 years under study. The independent effect of AF on in-hospital survival was not upheld, however, when a variety of potentially confounding prognostic factors were controlled for in a multivariate analysis resulting in an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.90, 1.52). Among discharged hospital patients, while the crude long-term survival rate for patients with AF was poorer than that of patients without AF for the combined as well as for individual study periods, similar to the in-hospital findings the independent effect of AF on long-term prognosis was not upheld after use of a multivariate analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arrhythmias were quantified by 24-hour electrocardiographic recording 16 +/- 3 days after AMI, and were classified according to the degree of complexity in 5 classes. Class 0 = less than 5 premature beats/hr; class 1 = between 5 and 100/hr; class 2 = greater than 100/hr or repetitive premature beats; class 3 = atrial-junctional tachycardia; class 4 = atrial flutter-fibrillation. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias classes 1 to 2 always occurred in the absence of symptoms in 86 patients (41%); supraventricular tachyarrhythmias classes 3 to 4 (paroxysmal, self-limiting, brief) occurred in 27 patients (13%), symptomatically in 6. The presence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias classes 2 to 3 was related to age over 55 years and complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias (greater than 20 premature beats/hr, ventricular tachycardia) (both p less than 0.05). Increasing complexity of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias was significantly associated with presence and entity of cardiac enlargement and left ventricular dysfunction (both p less than 0.01). Patients with class 4 showed the most severe cardiac deterioration.

End-diastolic and end-systolic sinus beats from right anterior oblique contrast ventriculograms were analyzed using the center-line chord technique with both a standard overlap method of chord assignment and a nonoverlap method. Echocardiograms were obtained in parasternal long- and short-axis and apical 2- and 4-chamber views and analyzed using a 16-segment scoring system to derive anterior and infero-posterolateral wall motion indexes using both overlap (10 segments for anterior, 8 inferior) as well as nonoverlap (9 segments anterior, 7 inferior) methods of segment assignment. There was a significant inverse correlation between the standard (nonoverlap) echocardiographic analysis and the standard (overlap) angiographic analysis for infarct regions (y = -0.43 X +1.11, r = -0.59, p less than 0.05). Fifteen of 18 patients with angiographic infarct regional score less than or equal to -1 standard deviation/chord had an echocardiographic index greater than or equal to 1.5, while 15 of 16 patients with echocardiographic regional infarct index greater than or equal to 1.5 had an angiographic score less than or equal to -1 standard deviation/chord.

To evaluate the diagnostic value of ambulatory Holter monitoring for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with variable threshold angina, 216 consecutive candidates for coronary angiography were investigated prospectively. For comparison, a group of 55 consecutive patients with fixed threshold angina was studied under the same conditions. Patients with prior myocardial infarction or angiographically documented CAD were excluded. Within 4 months of Holter monitoring, the advised coronary angiography was performed in 77% of the patients with variable threshold angina and in 89% of the patients with fixed threshold angina (p less than 0.05). The prevalence of CAD was markedly lower in patients with variable threshold angina compared to patients with fixed threshold angina (54 vs 90%, p less than 0.001). CAD patients of both subgroups, however, did not differ significantly with respect to the number of obstructed vessels, the Gensini coronary score, the number with impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction less than 50%) or the duration of ischemic episodes during Holter monitoring. Diagnostic accuracy of Holter monitoring did not differ between variable and fixed threshold angina groups (67 vs 78%). In 91% of the patients results obtained by Holter monitoring could be compared to the results of a bicycle stress test. In patients with fixed threshold angina the diagnostic accuracy was similar for both tests (80 vs 80%). In patients with variable threshold angina, the diagnostic accuracy of Holter monitoring exceeded that of the exercise stress test (68 vs 55%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 188 ischemic episodes was observed; 163 (87%) were silent and accounted for a total ischemic duration of 5,771 minutes. There was no difference in the baseline clinical characteristics between the patients with and without ambulatory silent ischemia. However, patients with silent ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring had earlier onset of ischemia during exercise testing. The highest density of silent ischemic events occurred between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M. Comparison of the class or combination of antianginal agents used by the 2 groups revealed no difference. However, in patients with silent ischemia the mean duration per event was shorter for those receiving 2 (p less than 0.05) or more (p = 0.001) antianginal agents compared to those receiving monotherapy. The average duration of silent ischemia per event was significantly less (p less than 0.001) in patients receiving beta blockers. These results demonstrate that silent ischemia during ordinary daily activities occurs frequently despite conventional antianginal drugs prescribed for control of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "The results of signal-averaged electrocardiography and programmed electrical stimulation were evaluated in 25 patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 46 patients with a history of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) to characterize the electrophysiologic substrate responsible for these different clinical arrhythmia presentations. Patients with VT had a higher incidence of late potentials (VT 83%, VF 50%, p = 0.005). Significant differences between these groups were also noted in response to programmed electrical stimulation. A sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in 24 of 25 (96%) patients with a history of VT but in only 27 of 46 (59%) of VF patients (p = 0.005). In addition, VF was induced in 11 (24%) patients in the VF group but in none of the patients in the VT group (p = 0.005). When the 2 groups were compared on the basis of select clinical characteristics, no significant difference in age, sex, presence of coronary artery disease or ejection fraction was noted. The frequency of prior myocardial infarction was significantly higher in the VT group (VT 20 of 25, 80%; VF 24 of 46, 52%; p = 0.03). Finally, no significant relation between the presence of late potentials and induced arrhythmias was noted in either group. The inability of signal-averaged electrocardiography to predict inducibility in VF patients may represent a significant limitation of this technique in identifying patients at risk for sudden cardiac death.\r"

Future devices will offer tiered therapy for ventricular arrhythmias, based on a sensor capable of discriminating hemodynamically stable from unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT). We studied 27 patients with sustained VT/ventricular fibrillation during 70 episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmias (greater than 30 seconds or requiring cardioversion). In this study, phasic arterial pressure (mm Hg), VT cycle length (ms) and right ventricular (RV) pulse pressure (mm Hg) were measured before, during the first 30 beats and after each episode of VT. During the first 10 beats of 23 episodes of unstable VT, the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) decrease in RV pulse pressure from baseline was 22 +/- 1.8 mm Hg; it was 13.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg during the first 10 beats of 47 episodes of stable VT, (p = 0.01, stable vs unstable). For the next 20 beats of VT, RV pulse pressure decreased from baseline by 22 +/- 2.5 mm Hg during unstable and by 12.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg during stable VT (p = 0.0001, stable vs unstable). The percent decrease of RV pulse pressure correlated well with the percent decrease in mean arterial pressure and percent decrease in systolic arterial pressure (r = 0.70; r = 0.69, respectively; p less than 0.001) during VT, but poorly with the VT cycle length (r = 0.27, p less than 0.05). The percent decrease in RV pulse pressure is a useful hemodynamic sensor for discriminating between stable and unstable VT.\r"

During a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range less than 1 to 83), 27 (10%) patients had a systemic embolic event, which was cerebral in 23 patients (85%) and peripheral in 4 (15%). In the analysis of individual variables, the risk of embolization was increased by female sex, underlying heart disease and left atrial size greater than or equal to 4.0 cm, but not by age, hypertension or type of AF (paroxysmal vs chronic). In multivariable analysis, left atrial size greater than or equal to 4.0 cm was the single strongest predictor of increased risk for embolization (p less than 0.001), but female sex (p = 0.014) and underlying heart disease (p = 0.027) also contributed. When each of these 3 factors was assigned 1 point in a risk score, embolic events were found to occur in none (0%) of 24 patients with a risk score of 0, in 2 (3%) of 83 patients with a risk score of 1, in 13 (11%) of 118 patients with a risk score of 2 and in 12 (26%) of 47 patients with a risk score of 3. The score allows patients with AF and without mitral stenosis to be stratified into high-, medium- and low-risk groups for systemic embolization. Such information could be useful in decision making for anticoagulation in patients with AF.\r"

Ten normotensive patients without heart disease acted as control subjects. In the hypertensive patients, RV peak velocity of atrial filling was higher (42 +/- 10 vs 31 +/- 7 cm/s, p less than 0.01) and deceleration half-time was prolonged (96 +/- 20 vs 83 +/- 10 ms, difference not significant); ratio of early/atrial filling velocity (1.1 +/- 0.3 vs 1.7 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.001) and peak filling rate corrected to stroke volume (3.6 +/- 0.7 vs 5.3 +/- 0.9 SV/s, p less than 0.001) were lower. LV filling parameters showed similar changes. RV filling parameters did not correlate with age, LV mass or septal thickness but correlated weakly with LV radius/thickness ratio. There was good correlation between RV and the following corresponding LV filling parameters: peak filling rate, r = 0.68, p less than 0.001; ratio of early/atrial filling, r = 0.88, p less than 0.0001; and deceleration half-time, r = 0.62, p less than 0.001.

In 7 patients with heart failure, the effects of dobutamine were examined on calf phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) spectra and femoral vein blood flow during rest and upright plantar flexion. During upright plantar flexion every 3 seconds, dobutamine increased femoral venous blood flow (control 1.7 +/- 0.1; dobutamine 2.1 +/- 1.0 liters/min; p less than 0.05) and increased femoral venous O2 saturation (control 24 +/- 5%; dobutamine 31 +/- 2%; p less than 0.05), indicating improved total leg blood flow. However, dobutamine did not change the slope of the relation between systemic VO2 and the calf inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine relation (control 0.0054 +/- 0.0039; dobutamine 0.0056 +/- 0.0032; difference not significant) and did not change muscle pH, suggesting no improvement in blood flow to active skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that dobutamine does not improve oxygen delivery to working skeletal muscle in patients with heart failure, despite its ability to increase cardiac output and limb blood flow.\r"

A lactate threshold, defined as the point of abrupt increment of blood lactate, could be identified in every patient; the ventilatory threshold, detected on the basis of the respiratory changes, was found in 26 patients (77%). Lactate and ventilatory thresholds were significantly related to each other (r = 0.94; p less than 0.001) and to peak VO2 (r = 0.89; p less than 0.001 in both). Among the resting hemodynamic measurements, peak VO2 was significantly related only to total pulmonary resistances (r = -0.35). Among the parameters at maximal exercise, it was positively related to cardiac index, stroke work, stroke volume index and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.89, 0.74, 0.74 and 0.56, respectively) and inversely related to systemic vascular and total pulmonary resistances (r = -0.74 and -0.63). Using multivariate stepwise regression analysis only maximal cardiac index and, to a lesser degree, total pulmonary resistance were related to peak VO2. Similar correlations were found between the hemodynamics and the lactate and ventilatory threshold. Thus, peak VO2, lactate and ventilatory thresholds can be detected in most patients with chronic heart failure. These parameters are highly correlated to each other and bear similar relations to the hemodynamic response to exercise. The cardiac index is the main central hemodynamic determinant of exercise capacity.\r"

The reductions of the septal segment in HC patients were significantly greater than those in 10 hypertensive patients with comparable degrees of septal hypertrophy. Of patients with HC, 16 had increases in thallium uptake well below the normal range. Compared with those having normal increases, these patients had significantly lower exercise duration (11 vs 15 minutes), with 33% having ST depression develop at a workload less than or equal to 80 watts. These data indicate that approximately one-half of patients with HC have impaired coronary vasodilatory capacity that could be an important pathophysiologic abnormality of HC resulting in the development of myocardial ischemia and the impairment of cardiac performance during exercise.\r"

Both groups had increased LV dimensional shortening (% fractional shortening) and stroke volume after exercise, although runners had larger increases compared to untrained normal subjects (p less than 0.05). Preload, as estimated by LV end-diastolic dimension, was greater in runners compared to normal subjects at rest (52 vs 48 mm, p less than 0.05). However, preload did not change after exercise in either group. Afterload, estimated by LV end-systolic wall stress, decreased after exercise in both groups; however, runners had lower afterload at rest and immediately after exercise compared to normal subjects (p less than 0.05). The runners' greater LV end-systolic wall thickness appears to account for their lower afterload. Data indicate that marathon runners have lower afterload at rest and greater decrease in afterload after maximal exercise, compared to untrained normal subjects.\r"

It was seen in the left atrium in 24 patients, in the right atrium in 4 patients and in both atria in 1 patient. Spontaneous atrial contrast was not seen in the absence of an associated cardiac abnormality. Univariate analysis showed a significant relation between the presence of spontaneous contrast and significant mitral regurgitation (p less than 0.05), the presence of mitral valve prostheses (p less than 0.001), atrial fibrillation (p less than 0.0001) and left atrial size (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of atrial fibrillation, prosthetic mitral valve and atrial size were independent factors for the presence of spontaneous contrast. However, of the 29 patients with spontaneous contrast, 13 (45%) were in sinus rhythm and in only 4 (16%) was the left atrial size greater than 60 mm. Left atrial thrombus was detected in 9 of the 150 patients. Although spontaneous contrast was noted in 5 (55%) patients with left atrial thrombus and in only 20 (14%) patients without left atrial thrombus (p less than 0.001), none of the 3 patients who had right atrial thrombus had spontaneous contrast in that chamber. Overall, 7 (58%) of the 12 patients with right or left atrial thrombi had no evidence of spontaneous contrast. Multivariate analysis showed that atrial fibrillation was the only independent clinical predictor of left atrial thrombus. Thus, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast is a common phenomenon observed in approximately 20% of the patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goals of this study were to determine whether abnormalities in phosphorus metabolism could be noninvasively detected using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy, and whether these patient groups could be distinguished from each other based on parameters obtained using this technique. Seventeen patients and 14 control subjects were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spectra were obtained from the human heart at rest using 3-dimensional spectroscopic imaging as a localization technique. Data were acquired over an average volume of 48 cc in 26.3 minutes using a 2 tesla imaging and spectroscopy unit. The ratio of phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate was 0.89 +/- 0.88 (mean +/- standard error) in normal subjects and did not differ significantly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or left ventricular hypertrophy. A prominent peak in the phosphodiester region was seen much more frequently in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in significantly higher ratios of phosphodiester to phosphocreatine (1.28 +/- 0.35) and phosphodiester to adenosine triphosphate (0.79 +/- 0.18) in this group compared to normal subjects (0.33 +/- 0.08 and 0.29 +/- 0.08, respectively). However, the various patient groups could not be reliably distinguished from each other based on spectral patterns. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of performing phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in patients with myocardial disease. The initial results indicate that, under resting conditions, the ratio of phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate is not consistently altered in patients with severe global cardiomyopathies or hypertrophy. Phosphodiesters are elevated in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a finding that may signify abnormal phospholipid metabolism in this condition.\r"

The rats were made hypertensive by left kidney removal, DOCA (50 mg) tablet implantation for 2 weeks, and saline diet (NaCl 9% solution as beverage). Normotensive control rats (n = 24) and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (n = 24) received indapamide, 10 mg/kg, or placebo by gavage 12 hours and 1 hour before measurements were obtained. The rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 50 mg/kg), intubated and ventilated, and a midsternal thoracotomy was performed. A first catheter was introduced into the ascending aorta through the right carotid artery. A perivascular ultrasonic flow probe was placed around the ascending aorta and allowing simultaneous recording of the phasic ascending aortic pressure and flow. Systolic and diastolic pressure, cardiac output and heart rate were directly measured. Peripheral resistance and systemic arterial compliance were calculated from hemodynamic records. After hemodynamic measurements, a segment of the left carotid artery was then isolated in vivo and its volume-pressure relationship was recorded before and 30 minutes after total abolition of the vascular muscle tone by local incubation with a potassium cyanide solution (KCN) (100 mg/liter) for pressures ranging from 50 to 175 mm Hg. The carotid compliance (CC) (microliter/mm Hg) was calculated, for every pressure step, as the slope of the volume-pressure curves. Indapamide significantly reduced the arterial pressure in hypertensive rats, and this was related to a marked decrease in total peripheral resistance. Heart rate was not modified by indapamide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a 2-week preinclusion period, all patients received indapamide, 2.5 mg/day, for a period of 6 months. Physical examination including blood pressure measurement was performed on selection (M-1/2), before (M0), and after 1 (M1), 3 (M3) and 6 (M6) months of indapamide treatment, and echocardiography was performed at M0 and M6. Quality of life was evaluated by means of questionnaires completed by the patient and the physician, and a visual analog scale was completed by the patient at M-1/2, M0 and M6. All clinical parameters remained stable during the 2-week preinclusion period.

The influence of hypertension on the progression of \"incipient\" nephropathy (AER ranging between 30 and 300 mg/24 hours) is not well defined, particularly in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. In this study, 21 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension (11 with normoalbuminuria and 10 with microalbuminuria), who were comparable for age, duration of diabetes and hypertension, were treated with indapamide, 2.5 mg once daily, and followed up for 24 months. Blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin excretion rate and subclass 4 of urinary immunoglobulin G (IgG4) were indicated. In normoalbuminuric patients, blood pressure was significantly reduced, whereas AER, IgG4 and GFR did not show any variation throughout the study. In microalbuminuric patients, blood pressure, AER and IgG4 were significantly reduced, and GFR remained unchanged. In patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes, antihypertensive treatment, which is begun during incipient diabetic nephropathy, may have a beneficial effect on the progression of the disease, although a long-term follow-up study is needed to confirm this.\r"

Originally 23 patients were selected. Three patients withdrew from the study because of refusal to go through the second 24-hour recording. Eight of the remaining patients had to be excluded for technical reasons, which left 12 patients available for analysis. All patients received a single dose of indapamide, 2.5 mg/day. Before treatment began, a 24-hour BP control was performed, and a second one a month later (37 +/- 8 days). The age of the patients was 46 +/- 10 years. Diurnal BP (8 am to 10 pm) and heart rate were, respectively, 148 +/- 15/101 +/- 6 mmHg and 79 +/- 9 beats/min; night BP (10 pm to 8 am) was 131 +/- 15/88 +/- 7 mmHg and heart rate 71 +/- 10 beats/min. After therapy, diurnal BP was 131 +/- 15/92 +/- 7 mmHg (-15 +/- 7/-8 +/- 4: p less than 0.0001/p less than 0.0001); heart rate 82 +/- 8 beats/min (difference not significant); night BP was 115 +/- 13/80 +/- 8 mmHg (-16 +/- 11/-8 +/- 7: p less than 0.0001/p less than 0.0001) and heart rate 70 +/- 9 beats/min (difference not significant).

The number of children seen annually for otitis media increased over that time. An increase in the event rate of otitis was observed; there was also an increase in the rate of myringotomy with ventilatory tube insertion. The rate of surgery reached a level, among 3-year-old children in particular (25.0 per 1000 cases of otitis among boys, 23.9 per 1000 cases of otitis among girls), that some authors have termed \"epidemic.\" Comparison of the trends in the rates of surgical interventions and the rates of medical consultations for otitis suggest that most of this so-called surgical epidemic for middle ear effusion is related to a higher frequency of the underlying condition and not to more aggressive patterns of therapy during the years studied.\r"

The prevalence of inlet ventricular septal defect was significantly higher in patients with Down syndrome, while muscular and subpulmonary ventricular septal defects were present only in patients without Down syndrome. The incidence of a cleft of the mitral valve was significantly higher in Down syndrome, while left-ventricular inflow and outflow obstructions were present only in patients without Down syndrome. Different patterns of ventricular septal defect and associated anomalies exist in patients with and without Down syndrome.\r"

In a situation of inherent uncertainty, treating patients vigorously could do violence to the moral principles of nonmaleficence and (distributive) justice. Equally, failing to treat patients vigorously because of concerns about nonmaleficence and (distributive) justice could violate the principle of patient-centered beneficence. Compounding this dilemma is the legacy of the \"Baby Doe Regulations.\" International perspectives on this particular quandary are provided. We assert that at Stanford (Calif) University the \"individualized prognostic strategy\" rather than the \"wait until certainty\" approach prevails. Four concluding questions are posed: Why is prevention not encouraged more than after-the-fact heroic intervention? Is it possible to develop a more rational view of stopping aggressive therapy once having started? Can we ignore the finitude of our medical resources? Is there a need to redefine the nature of autonomy?\r"

Growth delay was observed in both groups. No association was found between head circumference and percent weight loss, age to full gavage feeds, age to regain birth weight and energy intake at 2 and 4 weeks of life. Fifty percent of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 37% of the control group had minor and major handicap. Mean duration of assisted ventilation was significantly longer in handicapped infants (21.5 vs 12.5 days; F = 6.49; df = 1,53). No association was found between abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome and weight, length, and head circumference at 12 and 21 months after term. Although mean energy intake per kilogram per day at 2 weeks of life was significantly lower in handicapped infants (344.82 vs 412.86 kJ; F = 7.6; df = 1,53), age to regain birth weight, age to full feeds, percent weight loss, and energy intake at 4, 6, and 8 weeks of life did not differ significantly between normal and handicapped infants. Aggressive nutritional support to promote growth in ventilated very-low-birth-weight infants may not influence the neurodevelopmental outcome.\r"

Within 5 to 9 days of starting the infusions, four patients developed a pulmonary syndrome of moderate to life-threatening severity characterized by tachypnea, hypoxemia, and a diffuse interstitial pattern on chest roentgenogram. Pulmonary function studies showed restrictive dysfunction. Lung biopsy showed diffuse abnormalities with alveolar damage, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation. The inflammatory infiltrate comprised lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. Exposure of the biopsy specimen to fluorescein-conjugated anti-IgE antibody showed fixation of IgE to the mast cell surface, suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction. Detailed studies failed to identify an infectious agent. The temporal relationship between drug administration and lung disease, and the clinical similarities in the four affected patients, strongly suggested a cause and effect relationship. We recommend that therapy with continuous intravenous infusions of deferoxamine be monitored carefully with respect to pulmonary status.\r"

This study compares benefits for a sample of health maintenance organizations and traditional indemnity insurers in Connecticut. We conclude that in Connecticut neither health maintenance organizations nor traditional indemnity insurers currently offer comprehensive systems of care to these children. Health maintenance organizations offer preventive care and are easier systems to access. However, for children with chronic conditions, health maintenance organizations have some problematic restrictions, including a lag between start of employment and activation of health care benefits. Both health maintenance organizations and traditional indemnity insurers tend to have restrictions for specific services needed by children with chronic illnesses, such as medical equipment and mental health services. Case managers in both systems tend to control expenditures rather than to coordinate care. Representatives of both systems predict additional restrictions in the future. Our data suggest the need for more extensive evaluation of the generalizability of these findings.\r"

Bilirubin in the model solutions was photodegraded to approximately 60% of dark control in cool white light (17 microW/cm2 per nanometer). The presence of zinc protoporphyrin and zinc mesoporphyrin further reduced the bilirubin concentration slightly, but the tin analogues caused a significant enhancement of degradation to 35% and 25% of dark control, respectively. The results provide evidence that the zinc and tin metalloporphyrins are photosensitizers capable of enhancing the native photodegradation of bilirubin in biologic matrices, but that the tin compounds are more potent. The metalloporphyrin time course, dose-response curve, oxygen effects, and efficacy of phototherapy light sources were also studied.\r"

Sixty-seven percent of all trivalent inactivated vaccine recipients demonstrated a fourfold or greater serologic response to H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B following a single dose of vaccine. During the 1985-1986 influenza B/Ann Arbor epidemic, heterotypic protection afforded by the influenza B/USSR component of trivalent inactivated vaccine was 62% compared with placebo. A single dose of trivalent inactivated vaccine protected school-age children, 6 to 19 years of age, from influenza B infection; the rate of protection was 64% against infection and 73% against febrile illness.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral rhesus rotavirus vaccine at a dose of 10(4) plaque-forming units was performed in 114 young infants in Maryland. Significantly more vaccinees than controls had fever and vomiting during the week after vaccination, but these reactions were mild. Of the vaccinees, 83% had a fourfold or greater rise in neutralizing antibody to rhesus rotavirus vaccine and 69% shed vaccine virus. Seventeen percent of the vaccinees and 24% of controls had rotavirus-positive diarrhea during the 2 years of surveillance. Vaccine efficacy was therefore 29% (95% confidence limits, -31% to +66%). Stools from 12 of 13 episodes containing sufficient antigen to type were serotype 1. We conclude that rhesus rotavirus vaccine was infective, immunogenic, and probably acceptably attenuated but that this serotype 3 vaccine provided little heterotypic protection during serotype 1 outbreaks in the community.\r"

The method generates a variety of objects (single point, standard Snellen letters, low contrast Snellen letters, arbitrarily complex objects) in object space. The lens is the corneal surface evaluated by a corneal topography analysis system. The objects are refracted by the cornea by using raytracing analysis to produce an image, which is displayed on a video monitor. Optically degraded images are generated by raytracing analysis of selected irregular corneal surfaces, such as those from patients with keratoconus and those from patients having undergone epikeratophakia for aphakia.\r"

These signs included flattening and localization of bleb, increased vascularity, early subconjunctival scarring, loss of microcystic conjunctival changes, and increased intraocular pressure. After a follow-up of ten to 17 months (mean, 13.7 months), an intraocular pressure of less than 21 mm Hg was attained in five eyes without medication and in four eyes with medication. The treatment failed in one eye. The average dose of 5-fluorouracil was 28 +/- 12 mg per eye. There were no conjunctival wound leaks. Six eyes developed transient corneal epithelial defects. The modified administration of 5-fluorouracil can result in fewer conjunctival wound leaks. Its use can be limited to those patients who show evidence of impending bleb failure.\r"

All corneas developed some subepithelial haze by one month. Electron microscopy disclosed epithelial thickening, absence of Bowman's layer, and subepithelial activated fibroblasts surrounded by disorganized collagen. By six months, the haze faded to a variable degree, the epithelium regained normal thickness, and the collagen was more organized. Persistent corneal haze at 12 months in some corneas correlated with electronlucent spaces in the subepithelial zone. Corneas were 90 microns thinner centrally two weeks after myopic ablation, but returned to preoperative thickness by six months. Myopic flattening and hyperopic steepening of 6 diopters were targeted, and over 7 diopters of each were achieved initially. Regression of induced curvature stabilized over several months. At 18 months, 4.4 diopters of myopic flattening and 5.2 diopters of hyperopic steepening remained.\r"

Many investigators advocate aggressive surgical therapy for indirect neuropathy, particularly when corticosteroids fail. Significant recovery may occur despite no light perception, however, with medical therapy or even without therapy.\r"

We reviewed tissue sections, as well as autopsy and clinical records, from 135 patients who had fatal leukemia and had their eyes examined after death at Duke University Medical Center. Infiltrates of leukemic cells were found in the eyes of 42 of 135 patients (31.1%), with the choroid being the most frequently involved site. We detected a significant positive correlation between the ocular leukemic infiltration and an agonal leukocyte count as well as the severity of systemic disease. Differences in the agonal circulating leukocyte count may partly explain variations in the incidence of leukemic infiltrates in different postmortem studies.\r"

This is consistent with early-stage primary neuroblastoma. Histologically, the tumors were identical in each eye and well differentiated with Homer Wright rosettes; most neuroblastoma metastases have few rosettes and are composed of more undifferentiated, anaplastic cells.

We examined four patients who had Aarskog syndrome and unilaterally or bilaterally decreased vision on initial examination. Three family members had V-pattern esotropia, latent nystagmus, inferior oblique overaction, and amblyopia. A fourth patient had bilateral blepharoptosis and severe astigmatism. Other ocular features included hyperopia, anisometropia, deficient ocular elevation, blue sclerae, and posterior embryotoxon. These findings underscore the need for ophthalmic examination in asymptomatic patients with Aarskog syndrome to rule out treatable causes of visual loss.\r"

The mother and third daughter had normal electroretinograms. The two siblings, ages 12 and 21 years, had virtually the same electroretinographic amplitudes. In a second family, a man with microcephaly and inferior chorioretinal degeneration, examined at ages 9 and 23 years, also showed 60% to 70% reduction in electroretinographic responses to 0.5-Hz white light and showed no change in amplitudes over the 14-year interval.

Overall, serovar E gave more severe disease than the other serovars. The amount of disease induced by the 2 serovar B strains examined, TW-5 and HAR-36, varied. In general, animals showed resistance to homologous secondary challenge, which was better characterized by a reduction in the recovery of culturable organisms than by a reduction in clinical disease. However, following initial heterologous challenge, neither resistance nor aggravation of disease was seen. These observations suggest that a trachoma vaccine will have to contain the serovar-specific antigenic determinants for multiple chlamydial serovars.\r"

We found that peripheral blood lymphocytes from HAM patients proliferated spontaneously and released sIL-2R when cultured in vitro. Spontaneous proliferation was observed in T cell populations (both CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells), but not in B cell-rich populations or monocyte-rich populations. There was a significant increase of IL-2 activity in the culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 2-3 days cultivation. On the other hand, sIL-2R concentrations in the supernatants were much higher after 5 days of cultivation. Such spontaneous T lymphocytic proliferation and release of sIL-2R were also found in non-HAM HTLV-I carriers, but not as intensely as in HAM patients. HTLV-I infection causes T cell activation to release IL-2 and sIL-2R; such T cell responses may play a role in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy.\r"

This cross-sectional population-based study was conducted to describe the seroepidemiology of HTLV in the Republic of Panama. HTLV antibody was measured by first generation and commercial ELISA tests and confirmed by competitive binding ELISA, a radioimmunoassay for anti-p 24, and Western blot. Of 3,231 subjects greater than or equal to 15 years of age, 135 (4.2%) had antibody detected in ELISA screening tests, but because only 20% were confirmed positive, HTLV seroprevalence varied from 0.2-2% throughout the Republic. Infection with HTLV clustered in Guaymi Indians living in Bocas del Toro province (9.9% prevalence rate). With the exception of Guaymi Indians, no major geographic, urban/rural, male/female or racial differences in antibody prevalence were observed; specifically, HTLV infection rates were not elevated in black Panamanians. Clustering of infection in an isolated Amerind population must be further investigated. The small proportion of screen-positive sera which confirmed positive illustrates the importance of strict uniform criteria for seropositivity.\r"

  ".W": "Analgesic effects and plasma concentration profiles after interpleural (IP) or intercostal (IC) administration of 21 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine (5 micrograms/mL) were studied in 24 patients (IP group: n = 12; IC group: n = 12) who had undergone cholecystectomy or renal surgery. The number of blocked dermatomes, as assessed by pinprick, was more variable between patients in the IP group (2-9 dermatomes) than in the IC group (6-8 dermatomes). The mean time intervals from the injection to two-dermatome regression and to first need for additional pain medication were 4 h (IP) and 5.5 h (IC) (P less than 0.02) and 5.3 h (IP) and 9.8 h (IC) (P = 0.002), respectively. The degree of postoperative pain was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. This gradually increased during the first 4 h in the IP group (P less than 0.001), but not in the IC group. Peak bupivacaine concentrations in arterial plasma were approximately 10% higher than those in venous plasma and were attained more rapidly. Peak arterial plasma concentrations after IP injection (2.07 +/- 0.53 micrograms/mL) were significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than those after IC administration (1.36 +/- 0.48 micrograms/mL). Peak venous plasma concentrations showed a similar difference (IP: 1.86 +/- 0.45 micrograms/mL; IC: 1.21 +/- 0.48 micrograms/mL; P less than 0.005). Peak concentrations were attained later after IP injection both in arterial (IP: 16.3 +/- 4.6 min; IC: 8.8 +/- 5.4 min; P less than 0.002) and venous plasma (IP: 20.0 +/- 7.1 min; IC 13.3 +/- 6.9 min; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intoxication with alcohols can produce anesthesia. In contrast, chronic ethanol consumption can produce tolerance to inhaled and other general anesthetics. We tested whether ongoing consumption decreased, and whether withdrawal from such consumption increased, the intrathecal dose of lidocaine that induces sensory and motor blockade in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Sensory blockade was assessed using the tail-flick test, and motor blockade by the animal's inability to move its hind limbs. Rats were tested before commencing ethanol intake; during ethanol ingestion (9 days after beginning ingestion); and on the 15th day of ingestion, 14 h after withdrawing ethanol from their diet. Pair-fed control rats were tested at the same intervals. Ongoing administration of ethanol decreased the dose of lidocaine required to produce sensory blockade, but this difference was not significant relative to the control group (i.e., the difference was significant within group but not across groups). Withdrawal of ethanol increased the dose requirements for sensory and motor blockade by 80% and 53% (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.0001) and decreased the duration of the motor blockade (P less than 0.01). Dose requirements producing sensory block differed between alcoholic and control groups (P less than 0.0001). These results suggest that chronic ethanol intake produces tolerance to the local anesthetic effects of lidocaine. Whether this change results from a change in kinetics or in sensitivity is not known, but the latter would seem more likely, because duration of blockade was minimally affected or unaffected.\r"

We therefore studied the effect of the calcium-receptor blocker nifedipine on the analgesic effect of morphine in the rat, using tail-flick responses, and in humans, using measurements of the intensity of postoperative pain. In both the experimental animals and humans nifedipine significantly (P less than 0.001) increased the analgesic effect of morphine independently of any effect on the metabolism of morphine. Respiratory and cardiovascular functions were not significantly changed by nifedipine. The data indicate that Ca2+ is important in mediating the analgesic effects of opiates and suggest that calcium-receptor blockers might find a place in the treatment of pain.\r"

We initiated this study to determine if this positive inotropic effect was attenuated by commonly used receptor- and ion channel blockers. Neither naloxone (opioid blocker), phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker), polaramine (H1-receptor blocker), ranitidine (H2-receptor blocker), verapamil (calcium-channel blocker), nor lidocaine (fast sodium-channel blocker) attenuated the positive inotropic effect of meperidine. However, after lidocaine pretreatment meperidine increased contractile force by 57% (27%-80%) (median and 95% confidence interval), which is significantly more (P less than 0.001) than the 21% (13%-35%) increase seen after pretreatment with saline. After Na,K-pump inhibition by ouabain, meperidine caused no further increase in contractility, but the atria still responded to isoproterenol with an increase in developed force. Conversely, meperidine prevented the positive inotropic effect of ouabain. These findings suggest that the positive inotropic effect of meperidine is mediated by an increase in intracellular sodium activity and not by regulation of the slow inward calcium channel.\r"

Room-temperature and ice-cold lidocaine were injected into either dominant or nondominant wrists. Subjects were blinded to the temperature of the anesthetic. Inhibition of A alpha sensory and motor fibers was assessed as the decline in sensory nerve action potentials and compound motor action potentials, respectively. Inhibition of C fibers was measured as an increase in skin temperature and a decline in galvanic skin potentials. All indices of nerve function demonstrated profound (P less than 0.001) time-related changes after injection of local anesthetic. When ice-cold lidocaine was injected, inhibition of sensory nerve action potentials was significantly greater at all time points (P = 0.001) than when room-temperature lidocaine was injected. Inhibition of C fibers as assessed by galvanic skin potentials was marginally faster (P = 0.07) when ice-cold lidocaine was used compared with room-temperature lidocaine. No differences between room-temperature and ice-cold lidocaine were observed in inhibition of compound motor action potentials, or in the increase in skin temperature. We conclude that inhibition of median sensory fibers may be increased by cooling 1% lidocaine HCl in an ice bath before injection.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to have either a plastic oropharyngeal airway or a gauze bite-block in place during the operation and were evaluated for the occurrence of postoperative sore throat by questionnaire the day after surgery. The incidence of postoperative sore throat was 35.2% in the oropharyngeal airway group and 42.5% in the gauze bite-block group, not a statistically significant difference (P greater than 0.05). The incidence of postoperative sore throat was significantly higher when blood was noted on the airway instruments (64.5%) than when it was not (30.9%) (P less than 0.01). There was an association, although not statistically significant, between the incidence of postoperative sore throat and intubation by an anesthesia resident with less than 1 yr experience (P = 0.064). The data from this study indicate that the intraoperative use of hard plastic oropharyngeal airways, compared with the use of soft gauze bite-blocks, does not increase the incidence of postoperative sore throat. These data also suggest that pharyngeal trauma may contribute significantly to the development of postoperative sore throat. We suggest that aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning may contribute to this pharyngeal trauma.\r"

During stepwise induced isovolemic hemodilution, a gradual decline in SvO2 and PvO2 was observed in all animals. The mean +/- SD of the critical PvO2 of six animals was 32.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg. The mean +/- SD of the critical SvO2 was 44.2% +/- 7.9%. The ER increased gradually. At an ER of 0.57 +/- 0.08, oxygen uptake started to decline. A significant correlation was found between changes in SvO2 and changes in ER. These degrees of hemodilution were accompanied by an increase in cardiac index, pulmonary wedge pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular stroke work index. Only a slight decrease in systemic vascular resistance was observed. We conclude that measurements of PvO2 and SvO2 can be used as indicators of the critical point of hemodilution and that the SvO2 during hemodilution reflects the overall balance between oxygen uptake and oxygen delivery, confirmed by the strong correlation found between SvO2 and oxygen extraction ratio.\r"

The contractile responses of the arteries and the veins to transmural nerve stimulation and to norepinephrine were attenuated by exposure to enflurane; the responses to phenylephrine were decreased more than those to norepinephrine. When compared with the effect of enflurane on transmural nerve stimulation-induced responses, exposure to enflurane resulted in slight attenuation of the contractile responses caused by tyramine, suggesting that enflurane may inhibit the responses to tyramine by interfering with an interaction between released norepinephrine and postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors rather than with tyramine-induced norepinephrine release. The data are also consistent with the view that enflurane acts on sympathetic nerve endings to inhibit release of norepinephrine associated with electrical stimulation-induced nerve membrane depolarization.\r"

  ".W": "Radiographic misinterpretation rates have been suggested as a quality assurance tool for assessing emergency departments and individual physicians, but have not been defined for emergency medicine residency programs. A study was conducted to define misinterpretation rates for an emergency medicine residency program, compare misinterpretation rates among various radiographic studies, and determine differences with respect to level of training. A total of 12,395 radiographic studies interpreted by emergency physicians during a consecutive 12-month period were entered into a computerized data base as part of our quality assurance program. The radiologist's interpretation was defined as correct. Clinical significance of all discrepancies was determined prospectively by ED faculty. Four hundred seventy-five (3.4%) total errors and 350 (2.8%) clinically significant errors were found. There was a difference in clinically significant misinterpretation rates among the seven most frequently obtained radiograph studies (P less than .0005, chi 2), accounted for by the 9% misinterpretation rates for facial films. No difference (P = .421) was noted among full-time, part-time, third-year, second-year, and \"other\" physicians. This finding is likely due to faculty review of residents' readings. Evaluation of misinterpretation rates as a quality assurance tool is necessary to determine the role of radiographic quality assurance in emergency medicine resident training. Educational activities should be directed toward radiographic studies with higher-than-average reported misinterpretation rates.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of peritoneal lavage for diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury in trauma is limited by its relative lack of sensitivity for hollow viscus injury. Peritoneal lavage in the dog indicates that alkaline phosphatase is an early marker of intestinal injury. If these results were confirmed in human patients, alkaline phosphatase determination would improve lavage sensitivity for hollow viscus injuries. A study was conducted to determine the usefulness of alkaline phosphatase in lavage in human beings. Alkaline phosphatase was measured in all trauma lavage samples sent for laboratory assay during a one-year period. Two hundred ninety-two lavages were performed: 25 were positive by laboratory criteria, and 66 were grossly positive. There were 13 intestinal injuries--nine were grossly positive, and four were diagnosed by laboratory results. Three of these four patients with intestinal injuries had elevated lavage alkaline phosphatase. All three (lavaged from 30 minutes to two hours after injury) also had elevated white blood cells or bile in the lavage fluid. The remaining intestinal injury was diagnosed by lavage bile but had no elevation of alkaline phosphatase (lavaged 15 minutes after injury). Two patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase in otherwise negative lavages were observed for at least five days; neither demonstrated any evidence of intra-abdominal injury. We conclude that alkaline phosphatase is no better than traditional determinants of intestinal injury in peritoneal lavage. In no patient was alkaline phosphatase helpful in diagnosing a hollow viscus injury, and its use would have prompted two unnecessary laparotomies. These data do not support the use of lavage alkaline phosphatase to identify hollow viscus injuries.\r"

Unfortunately, it has the dangers and difficulties of any blind technique. Although usually performed in the awake patient, nasotracheal intubation has also been used in the apneic patient. Transillumination of the soft tissues of the neck with a lighted stylet has been shown to be a reliable method of orotracheal intubation. The usefulness of a longer, flexible lighted stylet as an aid to nasotracheal intubation in the apneic patient has been examined. Eighty patients, who were paralyzed, apneic, and about to undergo nasotracheal intubation for elective ear, nose, and throat or maxillofacial surgery were randomized to be nasotracheally intubated blindly or with a stylet by an emergency medicine resident or anesthesiologist. Sixty-three percent intubated in the lighted-stylet group and 41% in the blind nasotracheal intubation group were successfully intubated. There were no significant differences in the time needed to intubate or the number of attempts. There were notable differences in the success rates of individual intubators with each technique. Although not statistically significant, our results suggest a useful role for the lighted stylet in nasotracheal intubation in the apneic patient.\r"

There were 237 injured patients intubated in the ED; 21 patients (8.9%) had cervical cord or bone injury. There were no patients in whom a neurologic loss followed an airway maneuver. Oral intubation was the definitive airway maneuver in 213 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the type of definitive airway maneuver used (eg, oral intubation, nasal intubation, or cricothyrotomy-tracheotomy) between patients with cervical injuries and patients without such injuries. The risk of spinal cord injury secondary to oral intubation in the seriously injured patient was low in our population. Selection of the method for definitive airway control should be based primarily on the operator's skills and experience rather than the fear of inflicting cervical cord damage.\r"

No plasma sample had detectable parent cocaine levels; however, 26 (56.5%) had cocaine metabolite levels. Ecgonine methylester levels were detected in plasma from six children and ranged from 59 to 985 ng/mL. Benzoylecgonine levels were detected in none of 19 specimens not preserved with sodium fluoride, and in 23 of 27 specimens to which sodium fluoride had been added. Benzoylecgonine levels ranged from 40 to more than 600 ng/mL. No clinical sign of cocaine toxicity was observed in any child.\r"

One hundred children undergoing general anesthesia in the operating rooms of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles were entered into the study. Each child had a known preoperative body weight. After induction of anesthesia, each child's supine length was measured and hanging (inert) legs were weighted. There was excellent linear correlation between hanging leg weight and total body weight (correlation coefficient [r2], 0.95) for all patients, and good linear correlation between supine length and total body weight, r2, 0.86). Range restriction analysis for both techniques showed poor correlation for total body weights of less than 10 kg and poor correlation for the supine length technique when total body weight was more than 25 kg. The hanging leg weight of an inert child has excellent correlation to total body weight for children weighing more than 10 kg.\r"

The major deficiencies in pediatric emergency care identified by this survey concerned patient waiting time, weekend radiology coverage, patient follow-up, feedback to referring physicians, and feedback to emergency department housestaff on hospitalized patients. The data suggest that pediatric EDs associated with fellowship training programs are improving their quality of care, yet room for advancement in many categories remains.\r"

One hundred seventy-one responses were returned, revealing a subset of the membership (1.42%) with a special interest or expertise in pediatric emergency care. This group was characterized as to type of residency training, board certification (completed or planned), practice location, and percentage of practice composed of children. Opinions were sought regarding subspecialty certification, continuing medical education needs, and quality and quantity of pediatric emergency medical training in pediatric and emergency medicine residency programs. More than 200 physicians were identified as resources in pediatric emergency medicine for ACEP. The majority of the respondents favored subspecialty board certification. Continuing education needs are generally being met, but there is a need for better geographical distribution of courses. Minifellowships and more pediatric rotations for emergency medicine residents were suggested.\r"

Information describing EMS system configuration and performance was collected by written and telephone surveys with follow-ups. Responding cities provide either one- or two-tier systems. In a one-tier system, an advanced life support (ALS) unit responds to and transports all patients who use 911 to activate the system. Three types of two-tier systems are identified. In system A, ALS units respond to all calls. Once on scene, an ALS unit can turn a patient over to a basic life support (BLS) unit for transport. In system B, ALS units do not respond to all calls; BLS units may be sent for noncritical calls. In system C, a nontransport ALS unit is dispatched with a transporting BLS unit. For ALS calls, ALS personnel join BLS personnel for transport. Overall, cities staff an average of one ambulance per 51,223 population. One-tier systems average one ambulance per 53,291 compared with two-tier systems, which average one ambulance per 47,546. In the two-tiered system B, the average ALS unit serves 118,956 population. In the 60% of cities that use a one-tier system, one ALS unit serves 58,336 (P less than .0005). Overall, the code 3 response time for all cities is an average of 6.6 minutes. The average response time of two-tier systems is 5.9 minutes versus 7.0 minutes for one-tier systems (.05 less than P less than .1). These data suggest that the two-tiered system B allows for a given number of ALS units to serve a much larger population while maintaining a rapid code 3 response time.\r"

There was no association of appropriate release or inappropriate release with patient sex, contact with medical control, length of encounter, or time of day. Only one patient complication was believed due to inappropriate triage; this could be improved by implementation of standardized criteria.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity are properties of diagnostic tests and are not predictive of disease in individual patients. Positive and negative predictive values are predictive of disease in patients and are dependent on both the diagnostic test used and the prevalence of disease in the population studied. These concepts are best illustrated by study of a two by two table of possible outcomes of testing, which shows that diagnostic tests may lead to correct or erroneous clinical conclusions. In a similar manner, hypothesis testing may or may not yield correct conclusions. A two by two table of possible outcomes shows that two types of errors in hypothesis testing are possible. One can falsely conclude that a significant difference exists between groups (type I error). The probability of a type I error is alpha. One can falsely conclude that no difference exists between groups (type II error). The probability of a type II error is beta. The consequence and probability of these errors depend on the nature of the research study. Statistical power indicates the ability of a research study to detect a significant difference between populations, when a significant difference truly exists. Power equals 1-beta. Because hypothesis testing yields \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, confidence intervals can be calculated to complement the results of hypothesis testing. Finally, just as some abnormal laboratory values can be ignored clinically, some statistical differences may not be relevant clinically.\r"

DESIGN: Comparison of the results of this test with those of other tests in the study population and with data from the literature. SETTING: Referral-based endocrine division in a university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty-one patients with the Cushing syndrome were evaluated: corticotropin (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumors, 90 cases; adrenal adenoma, 13; adrenal carcinoma, 9; ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors, 6; corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH)-secreting tumors, 2; and autonomous bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasia, 1. The continuous intravenous dexamethasone suppression test was done in 101 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Dexamethasone (1 mg/h) was administered intravenously for 7 hours. A cortisol decrease of at least 190 nmol/L was defined as a positive response. In identification of patients with ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, this test had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 95% to 100%), a specificity of 90% (CI, 70% to 99%), and a diagnostic accuracy of 98% (CI, 93% to 100%). Only two patients had false test results. They both had CRH-secreting tumors. Cortisol secretion was also shown to be sensitive for feedback control in other tests, however. CONCLUSION: The continuous intravenous dexamethasone suppression test has better diagnostic accuracy than other tests that are currently used in the differential diagnosis of the Cushing syndrome, and this test is very convenient. The only false test results were found in patients with CRH-secreting tumors.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis comparing logistic regression models. SETTING: A tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Three hundred and ninety-one consecutive patients who had normal resting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and no digoxin therapy within the previous week. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The exercise ECG model, consisting of magnitude of ST depression, exercise heart rate, and patient gender, was highly predictive of three vessel or left main coronary artery disease (chi 2 = 100, P less than 0.0001). The model correctly classified 60% of the study group which included 56 patients with and 179 without severe disease. The addition of radionuclide angiographic variables improved the predictive power of the model (chi 2 = 124, P less than 0.0001). However, the exercise radionuclide angiographic variables increased the number of patients who were correctly classified by only 11 and the percentage by 3% (to a total of 63% of the study group). CONCLUSIONS: The modest additional advantage provided by exercise radionuclide angiography for identification of three vessel or left main coronary artery disease in patients with normal resting ECGs would not appear to justify its routine use for this purpose. Before this conclusion is used as a guide for clinical practice, our results should be prospectively confirmed in a separate sample of patients in another institution.\r"

SETTING: A tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with P. carinii pneumonia and underlying infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had bronchoscopy. Twenty-one patients who were on aerosolized pentamidine therapy served as the study group. Thirty-one patients who had not received the drug served as the control group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The yield of bronchoalveolar lavage for P. carinii pneumonia was 62% for the study group and 100% for the control group (P less than 0.05). This lower yield was significant for the subset of patients having their first episode of P. carinii pneumonia. The yield of transbronchial biopsy was similar for both groups of patients (81% compared with 84%). The yield of bronchoscopy was not influenced by use of zidovudine. Review of lavage specimen slides suggested that there may be fewer organisms present in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine. An atypical roentgenographic presentation of upper lobe predominant infiltrates was seen in 38% of the study patients and 7% of the control patients. In addition, pneumothoraces and cystic changes were also frequently seen in the study patients. Gallium scans, when done, were also atypical in the study group. Markers of the severity of disease, however, were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The yield of bronchoalveolar lavage for P. carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients is lower in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine. Unusual roentgenographic presentations and atypical gallium scans are also found in this setting.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective and prospective analysis. Six patients with eosinophilic fasciitis were identified retrospectively and two prospectively. Retrospective identification of patients was done by questioning hospital-affiliated rheumatologists and dermatologists and by searching the hospital dermatopathology database. The patients with scleroderma or morphea were prospectively identified by questioning consecutive office patients with these established diagnoses. SETTING: University of Pennsylvania rheumatology and dermatology practices. PATIENTS: Eight patients with eosinophilic fasciitis; 40 consecutive patients with scleroderma (27 with diffuse cutaneous and 13, limited cutaneous disease); 3 patients with morphea. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: All eight patients with eosinophilic fasciitis had taken L-tryptophan before the onset of their disease. All had myalgias and high peripheral eosinophil counts (most greater than 5000 cells/mm3). Only 1 of 40 patients with scleroderma (no patients with morphea) had used L-tryptophan preceding illness (P less than 0.001 compared with eosinophilic fasciitis). Six patients with eosinophilic fasciitis had taken L-tryptophan for less than 8 months. One patient had taken it for 9 years before developing skin induration. Two patients were newly identified as having hypothyroidism; two developed neuropathy; and two had severe flexion contractures (several occurring in areas without skin induration). Five patients had low-titer antinuclear antibodies, indicating a possible autoimmune process. Most patients had only a partial response to systemic corticosteroid therapy. One patient has had important disease regression in response to isotretenoin therapy that was evident even while she continued to take L-tryptophan. CONCLUSIONS: L-Tryptophan use can lead to eosinophilic fasciitis whereas it does not appear to cause classic scleroderma. The disease process does not automatically remit after discontinuation of L-tryptophan-containing products.\r"

DESIGN: MEDLINE search of English-language articles from 1966 to 1987 using the following medical subjects headings respiratory function tests, lung, lung diseases, and preoperative care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Relevant studies were subdivided by operative site. We included only studies for which we could determine pre- and post-test probabilities of morbidity, mortality, sensitivity, and specificity. Preoperative pulmonary function testing was found to have measureable benefit in predicting outcome in lung resection candidates. In selected patients, split perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary exercise testing appeared to be useful. Confirmation of these reports is necessary before these preoperative tests can be routinely recommended. In studies of upper abdominal surgery, spirometry and arterial blood gas analysis did not consistently have measureable benefit in identifying patients at increased risk for postoperative pneumonia, prolonged hospitalization, and death. Studies of preoperative testing for other patients, including those having coronary artery bypass grafting, lacked adequate data for meaningful analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative pulmonary function testing helps clinicians to make decisions on management of lung resection candidates. Although many studies of patients before abdominal surgery have focused on the utility of preoperative pulmonary function testing, methodologic difficulties undermine the validity of their conclusions. The impact of testing on care of other preoperative patients is even less clear because of poor study design and insufficient data. Therefore, further investigation is necessary before a consensus can be reached on the role of preoperative pulmonary function testing in evaluating patients before all surgical procedures except lung resection.\r"

These altitudinal visual-field defects (AVFDs) involved both nasal and adjacent temporal quadrants and respected the horizontal meridian. The reported conditions and locations in the visual system that cause \"conventional\" AVFDs and their bilateral occurrence are reviewed. Division of the visual system into altitudinal halves results from the topographic arrangement of nerve fibers and their blood supply in the retina, optic nerves, and visual cortex. Lesions at these locations resulting in AVFDs are usually due to vascular occlusion or may result from a penetrating missile injury to the superior occipital lobes. It is important to emphasize that the nerve fiber layer of the retina respects the horizontal meridian only in the nasal field, not in the temporal field; therefore incomplete AVFD is more common. Because of the anastomotic blood supply of the occipital pole, only AVFDs due to occipital infarcts spare fixation. Diagnosis of retinal branch artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is aided by the presence of a unilateral AVFD along with ipsilateral funduscopic abnormalities and, in most bilateral examples, by its sequential temporal development. Bilateral occipital infarcts, as in our two cases, are characterized by sudden, simultaneous onset of AVFDs, an absence of retinal, retinovascular, or optic nerve abnormality and confirmation by computed tomographic scanning.\r"

Also, the pattern-deviation probability plot highlighted the presence and significance of the arcuate scotoma. To my knowledge these findings have not been previously reported in the literature.

In addition, metamorphopsia lessened as grid intensity decreased.

In this prospective study, the following five uniquely different slide tests were investigated in 120 patients who underwent gastrointestinal tract investigation: (1) a combination monoclonal antibody guaiac test (Monohaem); (2) an immunologic assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with (3) a highly sensitive guaiac test (Fecatwin S/Feca enzyme immunoassay), (4) a popular guaiac test (Coloscreen III) (comparable with Hemoccult II), and (5) Coloscreen III/VPI (ie, with vegetable peroxidase) inhibitor. Computerized data show efficiency values for detection of fecal occult blood by Coloscreen III-Fecatwin S-Monohaem combined, 93%; Coloscreen III-Monohaem combined, 91%; Monohaem, 87%; Coloscreen III/VPI, 82%; Coloscreen III, 79 percent; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 77%; and Fecatwin S, 68%. Results of sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and false-negative test results, tests' predictive value, simplicity, and costs of tests in this clinically based study suggests that the concomitant use of the monoclonal, monospecific test for human hemoglobin and an appropriately sensitive guaiac test is a potentially valuable approach to mass screening and early detection of occult bleeding gastrointestinal tract pathology, including colorectal cancer.\r"

Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued if the diastolic blood pressure remained less than or equal to 94 mm Hg after a 6-month period on the lower dose of hydrochlorothiazide. No other changes were made in medications or diet. Sitting systolic blood pressure rose from 135 +/- 15 mm Hg to 140 +/- 14 mm Hg on reduction of the hydrochlorothiazide dose and rose still further to 145 +/- 20 mm Hg on discontinuation. Even greater increases in standing blood pressure were observed. There were no significant effects on the diastolic blood pressure with reduction of dose or discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide. A significant decrease in the serum uric acid and a rise in serum potassium occurred. There were no changes in serum glucose or lipids on reduction in the dose of hydrochlorothiazide; whereas, with discontinuation, the serum lipids and hemoglobin A1C fell significantly. These results suggest that the benefits of a reduced dose of hydrochlorothiazide may not be as great as considered heretofore.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of antilymphocyte antibody (ALA) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), identified in a previous study, was confirmed by testing a population of 200 patients with AIDS. Of these, 88% had significant levels of ALA vs only 8% of a control group of patients with non-AIDS-related diseases. In a prospective study, the levels of ALA were determined in 61 patients with AIDS-related complex who were followed up for 18 to 30 months. During this interval, 31 (67%) of 46 patients with significant elevation of ALA levels developed AIDS, while none of 15 patients without elevation of ALA levels progressed to AIDS. In a group of 85 apparently healthy homosexual men, also followed up for 18 to 30 months, a significant number of those with high levels of ALA developed clinically apparent disease, while those with low levels did not. These results show that the amount of ALA correlates with the present clinical status as well as the future risk of developing immune deficiency.\r"

The most important of these are the availability of a sexually active partner and presence of concurrent illnesses. Some of the age-related changes in physiological indicators of sexual function, such as vaginal blood flow, are the result of estrogen deficiency, and as such are essentially reversible. Despite the inherent limitations of many studies in female sexuality, a significant degree of objective measurements has been reported in the literature. Future research should focus on developing appropriate techniques for quantitative estimation of sexual response in women. The need for love and sexual intimacy does not diminish with age, and sexual history should be part of the clinical evaluation of older patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of fecal blood testing to cancer detection in a clinical practice setting, we studied records from 160 patients with both a new tissue diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma and a preceding stool blood test (HemoQuant, Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, Minn) determination. In this group, 71% had suggestive colorectal symptoms (particularly stool changes, overt bleeding, and abdominal pain) or anemia at presentation, and 29% were asymptomatic. Fecal blood levels remained normal in more than 40% of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In only 26 patients (16% overall) was an abnormal fecal blood level the sole heralding feature, but this subset of patients had a more favorable stage. Fecal blood levels were higher with advanced, larger, and more proximal tumors and with stools collected before purgation. We conclude that, in the practice setting, fecal blood level elevation alone is an uncommon but important manner of colorectal cancer presentation, most cancers present with symptoms, and fecal blood levels are often normal in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\r"

During the observation period, 20 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 14 cases of chronic active hepatitis, 8 cases of cirrhosis, and 1 case of glomerulonephritis developed in this cohort. The annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was 387 per 100,000 for men and 63 per 100,000 for women. The incidence of chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis was 193 and 107 per 100,000 in men and 158 and 95 per 100,000 in women, respectively. No cases of either essential mixed cryoglobulinemia or necrotizing vasculitis were seen. Sixty of the hepatitis B surface antigen-positive carriers died, with 13 (21.7%) of the deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma. The leading cause of death in this group was malignant neoplasms compared with accidents in the general Alaska native population.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the records of 274 consecutive deaths at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa, occurring through May 1988 to examine the approach of physicians, patients, and families in making the decision to invoke the \"do-not-resuscitate\" order. Of these 274 patients who died, 171 (62%) had do-not-resuscitate orders. Of these 171 patients, 86 (50%) were judged fully mentally competent on admission to the hospital; 44 (51%) of these 86 fully competent patients were included in the decision to withhold resuscitative efforts. In the remainder, the family was usually involved in the decision without input from the patient. Only 6 patients (4%) were admitted to the hospital with a preexisting do-not-resuscitate order. For the remainder, the do-not-resuscitate order was written a mean of 8.5 days following admission and 3.3 days before death. Documentation of this order with a specific progress note was universal. The principle reason cited for a do-not-resuscitate order was the presence of irreversible terminal disease in 52% and an unacceptable quality of life in 33%. When considered separately, patients with a principle diagnosis of malignant neoplasm had a do-not-resuscitate order written 80% of the time. Of 88 such patients, 48 (55%) were fully competent at admission. In turn, 36 (75%) of these patients participated in the do-not-resuscitate decision. Nursing activities were quantified for the 24 hours preceding and the 24 hours following the do-not-resuscitate order. No difference could be found comparing these two periods whether the comparison was made on the general hospital ward or in the intensive care unit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether body weight is a risk factor for mortality among older persons, we analyzed body mass index (weight [kilogram]/height [square meter]) data for 4710 white, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey respondents who were aged 55 to 74 years during 1971 through 1975, in relation to their survival over an average of 8.7 years of follow-up. In a multivariate analysis that controlled for elevated blood pressure, smoking, and poverty, we found no additional risk associated with weight among women and a statistically significant, but moderate, additional risk (relative risk, 1.1 to 1.2) among men in the upper decile (body mass index, greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2). In contrast, low weight (body mass index, less than 22 kg/m2) was associated with increased mortality (relative risk, 1.3 to 1.6) except for women aged 55 to 64 years. We conclude that the accepted definition of overweight (body mass index, greater than or equal to 27.8 kg/m2 [men] or greater than or equal to 27.3 kg/m2 [women]) lacks specificity and may be inappropriate for older persons who do not have weight-related medical conditions. The low-weight mortality association, consistently demonstrated, deserves serious scrutiny.\r"

  ".U": "90233871\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the incremental yield of ambulatory monitoring in the evaluation of syncope, three serial 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained in a consecutive series of 95 patients with syncope, the cause of which was not explained by history, physical examination, or 12-lead electrocardiogram. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 41% were men. Major electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in 26 patients (27%), including unsustained ventricular tachycardia (19 patients), pauses of at least 2 seconds (8 patients), profound bradycardia (1 patient), and complete heart block (1 patient). The first 24-hour Holter recording had at least one major abnormality in 14 patients (15%) (95% confidence interval, 8.3% to 23.4%). Of the 81 patients without a major abnormality on the first Holter recording, the second Holter recording had major abnormalities in 9 (11%) (95% confidence interval, 5.1% to 20.0%). Of the 72 patients without a major abnormality on the first two Holter recordings, only 3 patients (4.2%) had a major abnormality on the third Holter recording (95% confidence interval, 0.8% to 11.7%). Four factors were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of a major abnormality on 72 hours of monitoring: age above 65 years (relative risk, 2.2), male gender (relative risk, 2.0), history of heart disease (relative risk, 2.2), and an initial nonsinus rhythm (relative risk, 3.5). These results suggest that 24 hours of Holter monitoring is not enough to identify all potentially important arrhythmias in patients with syncope. Monitoring may need to be extended to 48 hours if the first 24-hour Holter recording is normal.\r"

The ability of laboratory tests and clinical signs to detect alcohol abuse was compared in 31 patients with severe heart failure due to underlying dilated cardiomyopathy. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 13 patients and a variety of nonalcoholic cardiomyopathies were diagnosed in the remaining 18 patients. At the time of hospital admission, all patients received a complete cardiovascular examination as well as routine hematologic and biochemical tests. Details concerning past and recent alcohol intake were obtained by an individual who was unaware of the diagnostic status of the patients. The two groups of patients did not differ with respect to clinical presentation, self-report of recent drinking patterns, or clinical signs and medical history items that have been found to be associated with chronic alcohol abuse. However, the group with alcoholic cardiomyopathy had significantly higher values for mean corpuscular volume and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Our results suggest that a combination of routine laboratory tests may be effective in the detection of alcohol abuse in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

Research data were obtained from court dockets filed with Wisconsin's Patients Compensation Panel and from 281 attorneys who provided the age for 431 claimants. The results showed that 10.0% of malpractice suits in Wisconsin were filed by the elderly during the study years. When we compared the frequency of litigation with the use of the health care system (number of hospitalizations and inpatient days), the elderly were significantly less likely than younger persons to initiate malpractice litigation despite greater exposure to potential negligence. However, once a malpractice suit was filed, there was no significant difference between older and younger litigants in the disposition of the case or in the likelihood of being the prevailing party when a finding or award was made. These findings suggest that the elderly are less likely to file malpractice claims against health care providers than would be expected given their use of the health care system. This finding may be related to social, economic, and legal barriers to malpractice litigation by older adults.\r"

  ".W": "Many clinicians have the impression that treatment of thyroid dysfunction ameliorates ophthalmopathy in Graves' disease. The aim of our study was to relate thyroid function to the severity of Graves' ophthalmopathy. We studied 90 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and Graves' hyperthyroidism in whom severity of Graves' ophthalmopathy and thyroid function (regardless of antithyroid treatment) were assessed when referred to our institution. Patients were assigned to four groups (A through D) with increasingly severe Graves' ophthalmopathy using Total Eye Score based on the NOSPECS classification. The percentage of dysthyroid patients in each group was determined: group A had 23% dysthyroid patient (5); group B, 32% (9); group C, 61% (14); and group D, 47% (8). More dysthyroid patients were in the groups with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. We also compared the severity of Graves' ophthalmopathy between euthyroid (n = 54) and dysthyroid (n = 36) patients: euthyroid patients had less proptosis (19.9 +/- 3.5 vs 20.8 +/- 3.4 mm), better visual acuity (0.93 +/- 0.17 vs 0.88 +/- 0.18), and lower Total Eye Score (8.6 +/- 6.6 vs 10.6 +/- 6.6). We conclude that dysthyroidism is associated with more severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Our findings suggest that meticulous control of thyroid function also during antithyroid treatment is important in the management of Graves' ophthalmopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with Graves' disease who spontaneously developed hypothyroidism after treatment with antithyroid drugs are described herein. Patient 1 developed a painful tender thyroid enlargement with a fever and accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate when she was receiving maintenance therapy with methimazole, and she progressed to persistent hypothyroidism with increased titers of antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies and marked reduction of goiter size within the subsequent 2 months. Thyroid-stimulating hormone-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBIIs) and thyroid stimulation-blocking antibody (TSBAb) were absent when she was hypothyroid. Hypothyroidism probably resulted from autoimmune thyroid destruction due to subacute aggravation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. During the clinical course of patient 2, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and later transient increases of antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibody titers were observed repeatedly (four times), and she finally fell into overt hypothyroidism. She also had negative results of tests for TBII and TSBAb. Her hypothyroidism appeared to result from repeated thyroid destruction due to aggravation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Patient 3 fell into hypothyroidism when receiving a small dosage of methimazole. The TBII and TSBAb were strongly active when she developed hypothyroidism, which thus seemed to be due to blocking antibody. Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism may eventually progress to hypothyroidism later by several different mechanisms. Severe and sudden or slowly repeated thyroid destruction due to aggravation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is one mechanism. Another may be the appearance of a blocking antibody to the TSH receptor.\r"

We performed a retrospective review of symptoms, manometry, and provocative test results performed on patients with undiagnosed chest pain. The 220 patients with angiographically determined cardiac disease and persistent chest pain were divided into three groups: coronary artery disease (125 patients), mitral valve prolapse (38 patients), and coronary bypass/angioplasty (57 patients). A comparison group consisted of 159 patients with noncardiac chest pain. All patients underwent esophageal manometry and placebo-controlled provocative testing (acid perfusion test and edrophonium chloride test). The prevalence of esophageal motility disorders in the noncardiac chest pain group (27%) was similar to that in the coronary artery disease (24%), mitral valve prolapse (37%), and coronary bypass/angioplasty (30%) groups. The frequency of nutcracker esophagus (11% to 16%) and diffuse esophageal spasm (2% to 7%) was remarkably constant. The prevalence of any positive provocative result in the noncardiac chest pain group (27%) was similar to that in the coronary artery disease (19%), mitral valve prolapse (32%), and coronary bypass/angioplasty (20%) groups. Furthermore, completely negative results of esophageal investigation occurred in 55%, 62%, 42%, and 59% of the respective patient groups.\r"

Epidemiologic investigation found a significantly higher risk for enlisted recruits housed in open barracks than for officers housed in private rooms. The attack rate in the first outbreak was 30%, with an estimated attack rate of 71% among susceptible persons. Serologic testing of 810 adult recruits from Puerto Rico for varicella-zoster antibody by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure found 42% to be seronegative, with no significant difference by sex. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test had a positive predictive value for absence of disease development of 95% in the second outbreak. Serologic test results were successfully used as part of the outbreak control strategy, with a resultant decrease in attack rates to 19% overall and 30% among susceptible persons in the second outbreak. Uniquely susceptible adult populations placed in conditions with high likelihood of infection on exposure are potential candidates for the varicella vaccine after its licensure.\r"

While these can be of great assistance in the evaluation of exposed individuals, they often contain deficiencies that preclude the prudent physician from relying exclusively on them. A few typical material safety data sheets are reviewed to illustrate what one can expect to find.\r"

At the 6-month follow-up, there were significant declines in total cholesterol levels (5.9 to 5.5 mmol/L [228 to 213 mg/dL]), weight (78 to 75 kg), blood pressure (119/78 to 115/75 mm Hg), and number of people reporting smoking (16.8% to 14.5%) among participants with a baseline cholesterol value of 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or greater. A randomized experiment was conducted on 137 participants initially classified as having a \"borderline-high blood cholesterol\" level (5.2 to 6.2 mmol/L [200 to 239 mg/dL]) to test the impact of frequency of follow-up. Those receiving frequent follow-up (cholesterol measurement and brief counseling at 2, 4, and 6 months) reported significantly greater dietary change and demonstrated a trend toward greater declines in total cholesterol compared with those receiving follow-up at 6 months only. The results of this study support the feasibility and efficacy of cholesterol screening utilizing brief nonphysician counseling on multiple cardiovascular risk factors and suggest an enhanced effect when patients receive more frequent follow-up.\r"

These patients were seen in either a control, feedback, or feedback/protocol clinic. Immediately following their medical visit we found the following differences between feedback and control patients: feedback patients reported that the stress counseling they received was more valuable, and they were more satisfied with their physician; feedback patients also perceived greater decreases in the amount of overall stress experienced, and reported greater increases in their perceived control over stress. There were no outcome differences between feedback and feedback/protocol patients. We conclude that the feedback provided in this study can enhance physicians' ability to counsel primary care patients with mental health problems.\r"

We examined the effect of a course of electroconvulsive therapy on lymphocyte beta-adrenergic responsivity in 19 inpatients with melancholia. Before treatment, beta-adrenergic cyclic adenosine monophosphate response to isoproterenol was significantly blunted in the patients compared with controls. Following a course of electroconvulsive therapy, beta-adrenergic responsivity increased such that patients no longer differed from controls. Thus, blunted lymphocyte beta-adrenergic responsivity is a state-dependent effect of melancholia that can be corrected by a therapeutic course of electroconvulsive therapy. The effect of electroconvulsive therapy on this beta-adrenergic system is in the opposite direction to that reported for rodent forebrain, where electroconvulsive therapy causes desensitization, and may reflect differences between peripheral and central effects, species differences, or disease effects.\r"

Temperament comparisons in this clinical population were made by using temperament normative values obtained in previous random samples of the general population in the greater Quebec City (Canada) area. Different clinical diagnostic groups (externalized disorders, developmental delays, and mixed disorders) were derived from a review of the entire hospital charts in which the interrater reliability was tested and performed \"blind\" to temperament scores. The diagnostic groups were confirmed through discriminant function analyses. The results (1) replicated, in this child psychiatric population, two factors of temperament similar to those previously found in random samples of our general population; (2) showed, in the psychiatric population of children, an overproportion of difficult temperaments on both factors; (3) confirmed conversely that a large proportion of children referred for a disorder did not present with an extreme temperament, and, therefore, an extreme temperament and a clinical disorder were not equivalent; and (4) suggested a specificity in the relationship between particular temperament factors and the type of clinical problem. Temperament factor 1 (withdrawal from new stimuli, low adaptability, high intensity, and negative mood) was found to be more associated with externalized disorders (opposition, conduct, or attention-deficit disorders), whereas temperament factor 2 (low persistence, high sensory threshold, and high mobility) was found to be more associated with specific developmental delays. The findings provided leads for future clinical research on temperament, family functioning, and child psychiatric diagnoses.\r"

This review was undertaken to evaluate current management in three Milwaukee (Wis) hospitals and to identify determinants of prognosis. We identified 25 patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma diagnosed between 1967 and 1987. Most of the patients were treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and 10 had mastectomies. The 5-year survival of patients without initial distant metastases was 24%. The 5-year survival of patients who received chemotherapy before local treatment was 40%. Patients who had clinically involved axillary nodes or a palpable mass in the breast had poorer survival than those who did not; the presence of dermal lymphatic invasion had no significant effect on survival. Initial chemotherapy has become an important part of the care of patients with inflammatory breast cancer. It remains uncertain whether mastectomy improves on irradiation in achieving local control or improves survival.\r"

All but 1 of the patients had known extra-abdominal metastases (primarily brain) at the time of the abdominal symptoms. In 11 patients the small bowel was the site of metastases. One patient had cecal involvement, while the 13th had common bile duct obstruction. The most common histologic type was a large-cell carcinoma. The extent of surgery was dependent on the pathologic findings encountered; most patients underwent resection of obstructed or perforated intestine. Eight of the 13 patients survived and were discharged from the hospital after a mean stay of 17 days. We conclude that acute intra-abdominal conditions from metastatic lung cancer can often be treated successfully by prompt surgical exploration, including bowel resection or bypass if necessary.\r"

Ileal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained at the initial operation, from the ileostomy and dormant ileal reservoir at the time of ileostomy closure, and from the reservoir 3 months later. Rates of uptake for four different substrates were determined by radioactive absorption techniques. Absorption of carbohydrates, amino acids, and bile acids was markedly decreased and of short-chain fatty acid mildly reduced in ileal reservoir mucosa compared with normal ileum, largely owing to a decrease in reservoir absorptive surface area from flattened villi. Reservoir uptake of the substrates evaluated within 3 months after operation was similar to that for normal colonic mucosa. Uptake of all measured substrates from ileostomy mucosa approximated that of normal ileum. The use of short ileal reservoirs and the avoidance of stasis may favor reduced bacterial growth and increased nutrient absorption.\r"

The splenectomized groups underwent autotransplantations with 10% through 90% of the weight of the intact spleen. The leukocyte count and the oxidative burst response of the blood leukocytes were measured in each group. It was shown that a total splenectomy did not alter the leukocyte/differential cell counts. Furthermore, the blood picture remained basically unchanged after an autotransplantation with 10% through 90% of the weight of the intact spleen. The phagocyte oxidative burst response was measured by chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescence response of these cells was reduced after a total splenectomy. The phagocyte oxidative burst response returned to normal levels following an autotransplantation. There was no correlation between the amount of autotransplanted spleen and the degree of the oxidative burst response. These findings indicated that a splenectomy results in a diminished phagocyte oxidative burst response and that a spleen autotransplantation returns this function to normal levels.\r"

Thirteen patients were symptomatic, presenting with increasing abdominal distention. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass or hepatomegaly. Ultrasonography and computed tomography were the most useful diagnostic tests. Fourteen patients underwent resection; 9 underwent hepatic resection and 5 underwent excision of the tumor only. One patient had marsupialization, 1 underwent a biopsy only, and 2 died of unrelated causes and the hamartoma was found incidentally at autopsy. In all instances, a large cystic mass with well-demarcated margins was found. Three patients were unavailable for follow-up and 13 patients were alive and well 1 month to 24 years (mean, 5 years) after diagnosis. Recurrence or malignant transformation was not noted. A presumptive diagnosis can be made preoperatively by normal laboratory values and a combination of ultrasonography and computed tomography. We recommend excision of the tumor in all patients once the diagnosis is made, with the expectation of complete recovery.\r"
