  ".W": "From November 1, 1982 through December 31, 1985, there were 19 centers and 382 patients that evaluated the effect of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) on the septic syndrome. Seventeen of these centers enrolled 304 patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine if early treatment with MPSS would decrease the incidence of severity of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients at risk of ARDS from sepsis. To ensure early institution of the MPSS or placebo therapy (PLA), patients with the presumptive diagnosis of sepsis were identified. That diagnosis was based on the presence of fever or hypothermia (temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C or less than 35.5 degrees C, rectal), tachypnea (greater than 20 bpm), tachycardia (greater than 90 bpm) and the presence of one of the following indices of organ dysfunction: a change in mental status, hypoxemia, elevated lactate levels or oliguria. The treatment, either MPSS 30 mg/kg or PLA, was given in four 20-minute infusions six hours apart and was initiated within two hours of the presumptive diagnosis of sepsis. The development and reversal of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was followed and resulted in data on 304 of the 382 randomized patients. A trend toward increased incidence of ARDS was seen in the MPSS group 50/152 (32 percent) compared to the placebo group 38/152(25 percent) p = 0.10. Significantly fewer MPSS patients reversed their ARDS 15/50 (31 percent) compared to placebo 23/38 (61 percent) p = 0.005. The 14-day mortality in patients with ARDS treated with MPSS was 26/50 (52 percent) compared to placebo 8/22 (22 percent) p = 0.004. We conclude that early treatment of septic syndrome with MPSS does not prevent the development of ARDS. Additionally, MPSS treatment impedes the reversal of ARDS and increases the mortality rate in patients with ARDS.\r"

Like most of medicine, the basis of these applications was and continues to be pragmatic in nature, and involves uncritical and untested judgments. The possibility of risks has been understated and possible benefits have been overstated. Individual physicians offering HBO and organized groups, such as the Undersea Medical Society, advocating its use may well be highly motivated, well meaning, and sincerely convinced that HBO is an important therapeutic approach. It may be that, buried among the host of indications, will be some disorders for which HBO is uniquely and highly effective. If so, the present nonsystem for evaluating responses to HBO will require modification, so that these potentially valuable additions to therapeutics are not lost. Because of its almost global application to a wide variety of diseases, HBO therapy lends itself easily to medical adventurism (therapy in search of a disease) and economic exploitation. If there is some patient benefit to come from the experience of the last 300 years, changes in approach, initiated by baromedical devotees or by medicine generally, or resulting from pressures outside of medicine, will be required.\r"

The assessment of RV function was made by the thermodilution technique. Calculations of RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) were performed. In 11 patients, increasing PEEP was accompanied by a progressive decrease in blood pressure (BP), stroke volume (SV), RVEDV, and no change in RVEF. Increasing PEEP further was accompanied by a further decrease in RV preload. The remaining two patients exhibited a decrease in BP, SV, RVEF and an increase in RVEDV. One of these two patients exhibited a large decrease in cardiac output (CO). Thus, measurement of RVEDV (best parameter of ventricular preload) and RVEF are easily performed at the patient's bedside using a special thermodilution technique. This allows selection of the best treatment of PEEP-induced decrease in CO.\r"

  ".W": "In spite of the improvements in surgical techniques and intensive care therapy, no appreciable improvement in the prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer has been made in recent years. Several types of adjuvant treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, have therefore been proposed and used in clinical trials, mainly in the United States and western Europe. The results obtained by the Gastrointestinal Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), using preoperative radiation therapy with 3450 rads, are reported here; this therapy results in a reduction in the number of local recurrences and also appears to prolong the five-year survival period, although a longer follow-up is required to confirm this. According to the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG), postoperative radiation therapy with chemotherapy seems to prolong the tumor-free interval in stages B2 and C when compared to surgery alone. Nonspecific immunotherapy does not appear to improve surgical results either in terms of local recurrences or survival. Some clinical trials suggest that systemic polychemotherapy benefit subgroups of patients with colorectal cancer. Toxicity is still very high, however; 5-FU is the more active and safe single agent but, due to the low response rate, it appears essential to identify new, more active drugs. Particular attention has been focused recently on prophylactic infusion chemotherapy of the liver, and clinical trials are now being made by several groups, including the EORTC. Preliminary results seem to show a reduced incidence of liver metastases in patients infused with 5-FU after radical surgery. Adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer patients undergoing radical surgery has so far given encouraging results. Future results are awaited with optimism, but they must be achieved through prospective clinical trials conducted by well-organized cooperative groups.\r"

Fasting blood glucose concentration was similar on the 2 days of study. The coefficients of variation of fasting plasma C-peptide, plasma C-peptide 6 min after the injection of 1 mg i.v. glucagon, and the increment in plasma C-peptide after glucagon were 16.0, 14.8 and 24.1%, respectively. The coefficients of variation of the corresponding plasma insulin values were 19.2, 24.8, and 34.8%, respectively. The coefficient of variation of 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion was 22.1%. Because fasting plasma C-peptide correlated closely with plasma C-peptide 6 min after glucagon (test 1: r = .70, P less than .01; test 2: r = .76, P less than .01), it seems that these two values can be used equally well as assessment of beta-cell function in NIDDM. In conclusion, fasting plasma insulin, fasting plasma C-peptide, and plasma C-peptide 6 min after glucagon stimulation showed a similar and acceptable degree of reproducibility. Plasma insulin 6 min after glucagon and increments in plasma insulin and C-peptide, as well as urinary C-peptide, seem to be less reproducible.\r"

An insulin bolus (2.1 +/- 0.2 U) was administered via the pump either at 2300 h, just before CSII interruption, or at 0100 h, after reactivating the pump at its usual basal rate (1.05 +/- 0.11 U/h). The insulin bolus at 2300 h induced a significant rise in plasma free-insulin levels at 2400 h (+6.9 +/- 1.8 mU/L, P less than .01), resulting in an early and marked fall in blood glucose concentrations between 2300 and 0100 h (-2.7 +/- 0.5 mM, P less than .001), with hypoglycemic values in five patients. The insulin bolus at 0100 h counteracted the fall in plasma free-insulin levels observed between 2300 and 0100 h and significantly increased plasma insulin at 0200 h (+3.2 +/- 0.8 mU/L, P less than .01). Blood glucose concentrations that remained stable during the 2-h arrest of the pump fell significantly between 0100 and 0400 h (-2.1 +/- 0.5 mM, P less than .005). This fall rate was significantly lower than that measured within the 3 h after the insulin bolus given before CSII interruption but significantly higher than that observed in a reference control group of patients whose pump was functioning normally throughout the night.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In phase 1, patients were begun and stabilized on a regimen of ultralente daily and Actrapid insulin three times daily. Phase 2 consisted of 4 mo of this intensified subcutaneous regimen. In phase 3, intranasal administration of insulin, with 1% (wt/vol) sodium glycocholate, replaced Actrapid insulin for 4 mo. Glycemic control was compared in each of the three phases. It was possible to maintain the dose of ultralente insulin relatively constant in only six of the nine subjects during the intranasal phase of the study. The six subjects showed a significant rise in glycosylated hemoglobin during the intranasal phase (10.4 +/- 0.6% intranasal vs. 9.1 +/- 0.3% subcutaneous, P less than .05) but not in plasma or urinary glucose levels. There was no significant change in the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes during intranasal insulin therapy in this group. The other three subjects were considered treatment failures. Six of the nine original subjects expressed a preference for intranasal insulin, and one subject complained of mild nasal irritation insufficient to cease treatment. The intranasal route of administration of insulin has the potential to replace short-acting insulin as an adjunct to longer-acting insulin in some insulin-treated diabetic patients.\r"

The acute care costs associated with this disorder are between $6 and $10 billion dollars annually. Although much has been learned over the last few years of the factors that predispose patients to osteoporosis and how these factors may be avoided, the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms for bone loss remain obscure. Significant technological advances have been made in the 1980s in the development of noninvasive methods for measuring bone mineral density that give indirect assessments of bone mass. However, these methods are very controversial, are not suitable for mass screening for detecting subjects potentially at risk, and have a limited place in routine clinical care. Osteoporosis is characterized by thinning and fragmentation of trabecular bone, which is probably irreversible when it is far advanced. The most reasonable therapeutic approach may be prevention, which can be achieved in many patients by estrogen therapy in the perimenopausal years and insuring an adequate dietary calcium intake, particularly in adolescents and in the elderly. Physical activity throughout life is also likely to be important in maintaining adequate bone mass. It is important to differentiate osteoporosis from other causes of osteopenia, for example, osteomalacia, primary hyperparathyroidism, and malignant diseases such as myeloma, since these bone diseases have a different natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment.\r"

  ".U": "88054827\r", 
  ".W": "In male Syrian hamsters, seasonal transitions between reproductive activity and quiescence are accompanied by major alterations in testicular binding of LH/hCG and PRL. These alterations are believed to be due to the photoperiod-induced changes in PRL secretion, but other adenohypophyseal hormones appear to be involved as well. To elucidate the role of LH and FSH in the control of testicular LH/hCG and PRL receptors, we have examined the consequences of selective suppression of gonadotropin release by immunoneutralization of endogenous LHRH. In adult Syrian hamsters, four weekly injections of LHRH antiserum produced significant reductions in plasma levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone and in the weights of the testes and the seminal vesicles; no change in plasma PRL; and a significant reduction in the total content (femtomoles per testis) of testicular LH/hCG and PRL receptors. The concentration of LH/hCG receptors (femtomoles per mg protein) was significantly increased. In adult males of another seasonally breeding species, the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), four weekly injections of LHRH antiserum produced suppression of plasma LH and FSH, no change in plasma PRL, a reduction in the weights of the testes and the seminal vesicles, an increase in the concentration of testicular LH/hCG receptors, and a decrease in their total content. Alterations in testicular LH and PRL binding induced by treatment with LHRH antiserum in the present study were qualitatively similar to changes induced by exposure to short photoperiod or by treatment with bromocriptine. We conclude that gonadotropins normally participate in the regulation of testicular LH/hCG and PRL receptors in the Syrian hamster and LH/hCG receptors in the Djungarian hamster. Seasonal changes in the content of LH/hCG and PRL receptors in the testes appear to be due to photoperiod-induced alterations in the secretion of both PRL and gonadotropins.\r"

  ".W": "Opiate receptor subtypes in the adenohypophysis were analyzed by binding studies with tritiated etorphine, phencyclidine (PCP), and N-allylnormetazocine [(+)SKF 10,047] in anterior pituitary cell (AC) cultures and membranes, and in cell populations separated by centrifugal elutriation. In cultured AC, specific binding of [3H]etorphine revealed two sets of saturable sites with Kd values of 5 nM and about 10 microM. The high affinity [3H]etorphine sites were present in low concentration and represent specific opiate receptors that mediate the direct inhibitory actions of etorphine and morphine on LH release in vitro. The more abundant low affinity sites, observed in the presence of higher concentrations of unlabeled opiates, exhibited the properties of sigma/PCP receptors. In intact AC and pituitary membranes, specific [3H]PCP binding was saturable with respect to labeled and unlabeled ligand concentrations, and Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of relatively high affinity [3H]PCP-binding sites (Kd = 98 nM in pituitary membranes). Relative potencies derived from inhibition of [3H]PCP binding in AC by PCP-related drugs were: (-) cyclazocine greater than dexoxadrol greater than N-[1-(2-Thienyl)cyclohexil]piperidine greater than PCP greater than (+)SKF 10,047 greater than levaxodral greater than (+)cyclazocine less than (-)SKF 10,047 greater than (+)ethylketocyclazocine greater than haloperidol greater than (-)ethylketocyclazocine. In elutriated pituitary cells, specific [3H]PCP binding was correlated with the LH content of the individual cell fractions. The binding of (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 was also specific and saturable in AC and anterior pituitary membranes, which contained two classes of binding sites with Kd values of 87 nM and 3.3 microM. In fractionated pituitary cells, specific binding of (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 was similar in enriched lactotrophs and gonadotrophs. The high affinity class of (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047-binding sites probably corresponds to sigma-receptors, and the low affinity class to PCP receptors. In contrast to the inhibitory actions of opiates on LH release in vitro, PCP and (+)SKF 10,047 stimulated LH release in cultured AC and enhanced the secretory responses to GnRH as well as KCl. The stimulation of LH release by PCP was dependent on extracellular calcium and is probably related to increased transmembrane calcium influx. The stimulatory sites may correspond to selective sigma/PCP receptors, and could represent a distinct nonopiate receptor subtype with the potential for modulation of gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A cleaved form of PRL (CPRL) has been reported to exist naturally in the pituitary and to be the main product of PRL proteolysis by its target tissues. A 16K fragment derived from CPRL has mammary mitogenic activity. To analyze the possible functional significance of the cleavage of PRL generated by incubation of unlabeled rat (r) PRL with a 25,000 generated by incubation of unlabeled rat (r) PRL with a 25,000 x g pellet from the mammary gland and liver of rats. The optimum pH for cleavage was 3.4. PRL and the cleaved products were easily identified and separated from other proteins in the sample. The mammary gland pellet from lactating rats was significantly more potent at cleaving the rPRL molecule than were those of virgin or pregnant rats. However, the livers of all rats showed a similar PRL-cleaving potency. Thus, target tissues may differ in their PRL-cleaving potencies in different physiological states. The PRL-cleaving activity was also present in rat milk. While cleaved and 16K PRLs were the only proteolytic products obtained from rPRL, the PRLs (ovine and human) or the GHs (rat, bovine, and human) of other species were processed into a variety of low mol wt forms. Human placental lactogen was not modified. Accordingly, the processing of rPRL by target tissue enzymes appears to be hormone and species specific. Cleaved and 16K PRLs had 100% and 6.5% of the binding activity for rat liver PRL receptors as did intact rPRL, respectively. Nevertheless, the 16K form may still be of physiological significance.\r"

  ".W": "The processing and trafficking of insulin in cultured rat hepatocytes were studied. A time course of binding of radiolabeled insulin to hepatocytes at 37 C revealed a rapid rise in cell-associated radioactivity that reached a steady state by 20 min. Using an acid medium to extract insulin bound to surface receptors, the time courses of receptor binding and internalization of the ligand were characterized. The earliest event in insulin processing was the binding of insulin to surface receptors, reaching steady state by 20 min with a t1/2 of 4 min. The internalization rate of ligand was initially slower than the binding rate, with a t1/2 of 6 min. Similar internalization rates of the insulin receptor were found by measuring the trypsin sensitivity of hepatocyte insulin receptors covalently occupied with a photo-affinity-labeled derivative of insulin [( 125I]B2 (2-nitro-4-azido-phenylacetyl)Des-PheB1-insulin). At steady state, the internalized ligand and receptor comprised approximately 40-45% of the cell-associated radioactivity. The time course of intracellular degradation was assessed by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitability and Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography of solubilized cells containing only internalized radioactivity. Intracellular TCA-soluble and low mol wt degradation products first appeared by 5 min and were released from the cell 3 min later. Chloroquine (100 microM) completely inhibited the formation of intracellular low mol wt degradation products as well as their appearance in the medium. The release of intracellular radioactivity was assessed by first removing surface-bound insulin with acid extraction. Eighty percent of the intracellular radioactivity was released in 45 min with a t1/2 of 8 min. The released radioactivity was assessed by TCA precipitability and gel chromatography. These results demonstrate that after 20 min, 43% of the released intracellular radioactivity is intact insulin. The percentage of intact insulin released increases in a dose-dependent fashion as the amount of insulin bound and internalized increases. In conclusion, the earliest event in insulin processing is binding to surface receptors. After a short delay, insulin and its receptor are internalized and trafficked into either a chloroquine-sensitive degradative pathway or a chloroquine-insensitive retroendocytotic pathway. The amount of insulin that traverses the nondegradative retroendocytotic pathway is proportional to the amount of insulin bound and internalized by the cell.\r"

  ".W": "The apparent toxicity of alloxan was compared in nondiabetic rats and rats made diabetic by injection with streptozotocin during neonatal life (STZ). In the perfused pancreas of nondiabetic rats, 1 mM alloxan rapidly but evanescently stimulated insulin secretion; this effect was followed by pronounced inhibition of the insulin response to 27 mM glucose (94% inhibition) or 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (76% inhibition). Conversely, in STZ-diabetic rats the stimulatory effect of alloxan was reduced to 22% of that elicited in nondiabetic rats. In further contrast, the inhibitory effect of alloxan exposure was abolished with regard to subsequent glucose-induced insulin secretion and attenuated with regard to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-induced insulin secretion. A relative insensitivity to alloxan was also seen in collagenase-isolated islets, where alloxan completely abolished glucose-induced insulin secretion in islets from nondiabetic rats, but only nonsignificantly reduced secretion (by 37%) in islets from STZ-diabetic rats. Insensitivity to glucose in STZ diabetic rats is associated with insensitivity to alloxan. This implies a common defect in the initial recognition site of glucose and alloxan.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments were performed to clarify whether LHRH might inhibit its own secretion via an ultrashort feedback mechanism acting directly on the hypothalamus. Using an in vitro system, mediobasal hypothalami (MBHs) of adult male rats were perifused in either the presence or absence of a LHRH agonistic analog [D-Ser(TBU)6,Des-Gly10] LHRH ethylamide shown not to cross-react in the LHRH RIA. In the first series of experiments, six MBHs per chamber were initially perifused with control medium and submitted to two K+ stimulations (110 mM) for 5 min every 30 min; the control medium was then replaced by medium containing the LHRH analog (5 microM), and three additional K+ pulses were applied. In the second series of experiments, a single MBH per chamber was exposed for the duration of the experiments to either control medium or medium containing the LHRH analog (5 microM). In both cases, pulses of K+ were applied to the tissue. The amounts of endogenous LHRH released both under basal conditions and after K+ stimulation were measured in the effluent (1 ml every 5 min) with a specific RIA. The results show that the LHRH analog inhibits basal secretion of endogenous LHRH from the MBH, and diminishes or abolishes the response to K+ stimulations. The specificity of the inhibitory effect exerted by the LHRH analog on LHRH secretion was shown by the inability of TRH to mimic the effect of the LHRH analog. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that LHRH, acting at a hypothalamic level, might participate in the control of its own release via an ultrashort feedback mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "88054854\r", 
  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an important role in the control of gonadotropin secretion. The present study was conducted to identify the effect and site of action of different GABAergic drugs on LH secretion in vivo and to characterize the precise roles of different GABA receptors in these actions. Three different GABAergic drugs were used: muscimol and baclofen, which act at the level of the GABA A- and GABA B-receptors, respectively, and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), which increases the GABA content in the brain. The effects of these drugs were investigated in situations of enhanced LH secretion due to administration of naloxone or LHRH. In an initial experiment, adult male rats were treated ip with AOAA, followed by naloxone. AOAA treatment decreased basal LH levels and prevented naloxone-stimulated LH release. PRL levels were decreased by either AOAA or naloxone; however, the combination of these two drugs did not induce an additional or synergistic effect on the decreased PRL levels. In subsequent experiments, freely moving rats bearing Silastic cannulae in the right jugular vein received AOAA, muscimol, or baclofen a few minutes before either naloxone or LHRH administration. Baclofen and AOAA completely suppressed the naloxone-stimulated LH increase. Muscimol did not prevent the effect of naloxone. None of the three GABAergic drugs affected LH release in rats receiving LHRH. The results of these in vivo experiments suggest that the GABAergic system exerts primarily an inhibitory effect on gonadotropin secretion which is mediated at a central level, since pituitary responsiveness to LHRH is not affected by GABAergic drug treatment. GABA B-receptors are responsible for the inhibitory action of GABA.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to determine whether an ultrashort loop feedback mechanism is involved in the regulation of LHRH secretion. Daily administration of a highly potent LHRH agonist (LHRH-AGO; [D-Ala6,Des-Gly10] LHRH ethylamide) immediately after orchidectomy (ORDX) significantly attenuated the rise of plasma LH from days 2 through 10 after ORDX. Concomitantly with the diminished LH rise after ORDX, a significant increase in LHRH content in the arcuate nucleus was observed in LHRH-AGO-treated rats. Measurement of LHRH levels in hypophyseal portal blood in rats 10 days after ORDX combined with daily agonist treatment revealed a significant decrease in LHRH values in portal plasma compared with those in orchidectomized controls. Arcuate nuclei-median eminence (ME) fragments obtained from ORDX rats treated in vivo with LHRH-AGO for 5 days showed a decreased basal secretion of LHRH and a diminished response to K+ stimulation compared with the release from fragments obtained from ORDX saline-treated controls. To evaluate whether a tonic LHRH inhibitory activity operates within the ME, additional experiments were performed in which ME fragments were incubated in vitro in the presence of a potent LHRH antagonist [( D-pGlu1,D-Phe2,D-Trp3,6]LHRH). The antagonist significantly enhanced the basal secretion of LHRH in a dose-dependent manner. The latter results suggest that LHRH antagonists may enhance LHRH release, perhaps by interacting with LHRH receptors playing an inhibitory role on the endogenous secretion of the decapeptide. These observations strongly suggest a tonic inhibitory or modulatory role of LHRH neurons in the regulation of their own function.\r"

This phenomenon tended to decline in 21 subjects with long-standing diabetes (greater than 1 yr) who taken as a group presented a normal number of RIN rosetting lymphocytes. The islet specificity of these diabetic rosettes was confirmed because, compared with controls, lymphocytes from recent-onset type I diabetic subjects also displayed a greater intensity of adherence to normal mouse islets but not to unrelated K562 and TS cell lines. As demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence studies, these diabetic rosettes contained 54% of T-lymphocytes (OKT3+, OKT4+, or OKT8+), whereas only 20% of T-lymphocytes were found in background rosettes. The high percentage (66%) of la+ cells found in diabetic rosettes suggests that at least some of the cytoadherent T-lymphocytes from recent-onset type I diabetic subjects are activated. Natural killer (NK) cells do not seem to be the major cell type implicated in this phenomenon, because Leu 11+ cells were less represented in diabetic rosettes (25%) than in background rosettes (53%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Glucose was administered to the subjects on three occasions: as a 75-g oral dose, a 75-g i.v. infusion, and an intravenous glucose infusion at a variable rate adjusted to mimic the peripheral glucose levels obtained after the oral glucose load (matching experiment). Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured for the subsequent 5 h. The glucose level after the oral glucose load (115.9 +/- 2.6 mg/dl, mean +/- SE) closely approximated that after the matching experiment (120.5 +/- 2.5 mg/dl) but was significantly lower than after 75 g i.v. glucose (127.7 +/- 3.4 mg/dl, P less than .05).

Thirty-nine normal-weight, age-matched subjects served as controls. Both fasting plasma insulin concentration and glucose-stimulated (hyperglycemic clamp) insulin secretion were significantly (P less than .001) increased in the obese subjects. After the training program fasting insulin levels decreased by 26% (P less than .01). Insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia decreased by a similar percentage (P less than .01). Nonetheless, total-body glucose metabolism increased significantly (P less than .05) during the hyperglycemic clamp. With the euglycemic insulin clamp, obese subjects were shown to be significantly (P less than .001) insulin resistant compared with controls. The decrease in total-body glucose uptake resulted from defects in both peripheral glucose disposal and suppression of hepatic glucose production. After the 6-wk training program, insulin-mediated total-body glucose metabolism increased due to significant improvements in peripheral glucose uptake (P less than .01) and more effective suppression of hepatic glucose production (P less than .05). These results indicate that a moderate-intensity physical conditioning program is capable of ameliorating the insulin resistance and reducing glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinemia observed in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance.\r"

Body weight (mean +/- SE) of male rats was greater than that of female rats at both 11 wk (319 +/- 3 vs. 237 +/- 13 g) and 12 mo (684 +/- 17 vs. 376 +/- 13 g) of age. Pancreatic weight and percentage of the pancreas occupied by islet tissue were also greater in male rats and increased in approximate proportion to the gain in weight. The first phase and the second phase of maximal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar in all four groups of rats. However, because islet cell mass increased with age, maximal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion declined with age in rats of both sexes when expressed per unit islet tissue. Although the fall in insulin secretion (per islet cell mass) with age was observed in perfused pancreases from both male and female rats, the pancreases of female rats contained relatively less islet tissue and secreted more insulin per unit islet cell mass than pancreases of male rats at either age. Thus, there are sex differences in both islet cell structure and function, but the effect of age on endocrine pancreatic function seems to be independent of sex.\r"

  ".W": "The human fetal pancreas represents a source of insulin-producing beta-cells with a potential for transplantation to diabetic patients. It has previously been shown that such cells can be viably maintained in tissue culture media containing fetal calf serum (FCS) and that these explants continue to synthesize and release insulin. In this study the effects of human serum (HS) on the growth and function of human fetal pancreatic explants have been compared with those of FCS. For this purpose, pancreatic glands, obtained after prostaglandin-induced abortions, were briefly exposed to collagenase, and the digest was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% pooled HS or FCS. The outgrowth of isletlike cell clusters (ICCs) was monitored. In 31 of 58 consecutively explanted glands, development of ICCs was observed. In the presence of FCS the outgrowth of ICC took place on top of a fibroblast monocellular cell layer; HS effected less growth of fibroblasts and increased the formation of ICCs about sevenfold compared with explants from the same glands maintained in FCS. However, in the explant cultures with HS, the cell number per ICC, expressed as DNA content, was reduced by 50%. In both FCS and HS the insulin content of the medium showed great variability and progressively declined from day 2 to day 5. The medium glucagon concentration also decreased but not to the same extent as that of insulin. Immunocytochemical-stained ICCs showed insulin- and glucagon-positive cells scattered among most nonstained, presumably nonendocrine cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prior exposure of isolated perifused rat islets to the sulfated gut hormone cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8S) dramatically increased their insulin secretory response to 7.5 mM glucose, 10 mM arginine, and 10 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate. In the case of glucose, the heightened secretory response was still apparent 60-80 min after CCK-8S removal from the perifusion medium. Prior exposure of perifused islets to arginine (10 mM), tolbutamide (25 microM), or forskolin (1.0 microM) did not sensitize them to 7.5 mM glucose. CCK-8S exposure increased 3H efflux from islets prelabeled with [3H]inositol, and the increase in 3H efflux was sustained after CCK-8S removal from the perifusion medium. The duration of this increase in 3H efflux paralleled the temporal characteristics of this sensitization process and was significantly attenuated by 25 microM asperlicin, a competitive antagonist of CCK binding to its membrane receptor. Arginine, tolbutamide, or forskolin treatment of islets did not increase 3H efflux from [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets. The results suggest that the turnover of membrane phosphoinositides induced by CCK-8S is largely responsible for this heightened state of secretory responsiveness to various stimulants. Second-messenger molecules generated during phosphoinositide turnover may be responsible for the phenomenon of sensitization displayed by islet tissue to CCK-8S addition.\r"

  ".U": "88055905\r", 
  ".W": "The sera of type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects are reported to contain autoantibodies against a 64,000-Mr protein identified in [35S]methionine biosynthetically labeled pancreatic islet cells. We have attempted to localize this autoantigen to the surface of the beta-cell and to define its properties. Sera from 10 newly diagnosed type I diabetic subjects, including five of the index sera originally used to identify the autoantigen, were shown to specifically precipitate a reduced protein of 67,000 Mr from Triton-solubilized, surface 125I-labeled cultured adult human islet and rat insulinoma (RINm5F) cells but not from fresh rat spleen cells. Further characterization revealed that this protein was bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorbed to cells from fetal calf serum (FCS)-supplemented culture medium and precipitated by BSA antibodies present in many diabetic sera. No labeled proteins were specifically precipitated when surface 125I-labeled and solubilized human islet or RINm5F cells were precleared with anti-BSA immunoglobulins or when cells were first cultured in human serum. In contrast, a 64,000-Mr protein, clearly not BSA, was precipitated by diabetic globulins from human islets but not from RINm5F cells labeled with [35S]methionine. In addition, a protein of the same size as well as proteins of approximately 35,000, 43,000, 140,000, and 200,000 Mr were specifically precipitated by diabetic globulins from freshly isolated human islets solubilized in Triton X-100 and then labeled with 125I. These findings suggest that the 64,000-Mr antigen is not expressed on the surface of human islet cells, at least in culture, and therefore question its relevance as a target for islet cell surface antibodies in initiating beta-cell damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A reduced thermic effect of glucose in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has been previously reported. To investigate whether this defect is related to 1) a decreased rate of glucose storage, 2) a reduced energy cost of glucose storage, or 3) a defect in the sympathetically mediated component of thermogenesis, we studied the thermic effect of ingested and infused glucose in nine NIDDM obese Pima Indians [90.5 +/- 3.9 kg, 39 +/- 2% fat, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 130 +/- 10 mg/dl] and in nine nondiabetic obese Pima Indians (99.3 +/- 7.2 kg, 38 +/- 2% fat, FPG 103 +/- 2 mg/dl). Energy expenditure and glucose storage were derived from indirect calorimetry measurements. The thermic effect of 100 g of glucose was found to be similar in both groups (4.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.3% of energy ingested in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, respectively) but lower than that previously reported in nonobese subjects. The cost of glucose storage calculated after stimulating storage by constant glucose infusion (0.46 g/min) and variable insulin infusion (19.5 +/- 3.8 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6 mU.kg-1.min-1 in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, respectively; P less than .01) was similar in both groups (approximately 0.35 kcal/g glucose stored) and not different from that reported in lean subjects. As opposed to lean and obese Caucasian subjects, energy expenditure failed to markedly decrease during propranolol infusion in both nondiabetic and diabetic Pima Indians. We postulate that the decreased rate of tissue glucose uptake and storage associated with insulin resistance is the major cause of the lower thermic effect of ingested glucose in NIDDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro tests demonstrated long-term compatibility with refill cycles of up to 3 mo, with a preparation of 400 U/ml. Total test period in vitro was 3.2 device-yr (combined time of device use). Insulin retained 88-93% native structure. A major modification, which was biologically active and nonimmunogenic, was identified and partially characterized. Examination of one device by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis after 1 yr of insulin infusion revealed surfaces clean of insulin precipitate or other material along the entire insulin-delivery pathway. Surface analysis of the silicone-lined polyethylene catheters after 6 mo of infusion also showed no evidence of major insulin precipitate. In vivo stability trials were accomplished with PIMS implanted in diabetic dogs with an intraperitoneal delivery site. There has been no insulin blockage of the catheter of active pumps after 5.1 dog-yr (combined time of trials) of trials (up to 5 mo between refills in a single dog). Structural stability of insulin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. On average, 90.8% of the insulin sampled from the reservoir in vivo was native insulin, with an average of 96.2% retention of active forms.\r"

In comparison with healthy controls, patients with end-stage liver disease had significantly decreased concentrations of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase mass, apolipoprotein A-1, total phospholipids, and both total and esterified cholesterol. Elevated phosphatidylcholine and reduced lysophosphatidylcholine fractions indicated impairment of cholesterol esterification by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Constituent fatty acids of the patients' phospholipids and cholesterol esters manifested increased saturation and a concomitant reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicative of impaired hepatic elongation and desaturation of essential fatty acids. By the third month after hepatic replacement, the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, phospholipids, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and apolipoprotein A-1 were comparable to those of the healthy subjects. Despite the improvement in cholesterol esterification and the rapid normalization of the enzyme and cofactor involved in this process, the percentage of phosphatidylcholine remained significantly higher and the percentages of lysophosphatidylcholine and esterified cholesterol remained significantly lower than in the healthy subjects at 6 mo. Phospholipid and cholesterol ester fatty acid patterns attained normalcy by the sixth month after transplant. We conclude that hepatic transplantation effectively restores cholesterol and essential fatty acid metabolism in patients with end-stage liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a prospective randomized controlled trial of elective endoscopic intravariceal sclerotherapy carried out over a 36-mo period in comparison with elective percutaneous transhepatic obliteration of varices (PTO) are presented. Sixty-six patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis were randomized after they had stabilized, usually between 7 and 14 days after variceal bleeding had stopped following medical treatment (balloon tamponade and vasopressin infusion). Thirty-three patients were assigned to the sclerotherapy group and the other 33 patients were assigned to the PTO group. The mean follow-up period was similar in both groups. There was no significant difference in demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between the two groups. Six patients (18%) in the sclerotherapy group and 21 (64%) in the PTO group had at least one episode of gastrointestinal bleeding during the follow-up period (p less than 0.005). Three patients in the sclerotherapy group and 1 patient in the PTO group bled from lesions other than varices; therefore the incidence of variceal bleeding was 9% in the former and 61% in the latter (p less than 0.005). The cumulative variceal bleeding rate was significantly lower in the sclerotherapy group than the PTO group (p less than 0.05). Five patients in the sclerotherapy group died during the follow-up period but none died of recurrent variceal bleeding. Nineteen patients in the PTO group died and 10 of them died of bleeding from varices. The cumulative survival rate was significantly better in the sclerotherapy group (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that elective endoscopic intravariceal sclerotherapy is superior to elective PTO in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage and mortality in nonalcoholic cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were measured in 19 cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding enrolled in a controlled trial of propranolol for the prevention of rebleeding. The patients were studied on three separate occasions. The first study was performed before randomization within 24 h of the bleeding episode, once hemodynamic stabilization had been achieved. The second study was performed after 10 days of treatment, and the third after 6 mo without rebleeding. Propranolol dosage was titrated according to blood levels. Wedged and free hepatic venous pressures and the hepatic venous pressure gradient were recorded. Hepatic blood flow and cardiac output were also measured. Before treatment, the groups of patients treated with propranolol (n = 11) or placebo (n = 8) were comparable according to clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic parameters. After 10 days, hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased similarly in the two groups (-20% in the propranolol group, -25% in the placebo group). Cardiac output fell only in the propranolol group (-40%). Hepatic blood flow remained unchanged in either group. After 6 mo, hepatic venous pressure gradient remained lower than the values from the first (within 24 h of bleeding) study in both the propranolol group (n = 5) and the placebo group (n = 6). Our results suggest that portal pressure increases shortly after hemorrhage with a return to baseline values 10 days later, and that propranolol does not further magnify these changes. Spontaneous changes in hepatic hemodynamics after variceal hemorrhage must be taken into account when evaluating the effect of pharmacologic agents on portal pressure.\r"

When the colitis activity at study entry was compared with that observed at the completion of the study period, statistically significant or nearly significant improvement was demonstrated within the combined olsalazine group (p = 0.01) and within patient groups receiving olsalazine at daily doses of 1.5 g (p = 0.04) and 3 g (p = 0.055). A dose-response relationship was suggested because 16%, 29%, 27%, and 50% of patients improved in the placebo and 0.75-, 1.5-, and 3-g olsalazine groups, respectively, (p = 0.04). A similar pattern of improvement was seen when sigmoidoscopic criteria were used, although a dose-response relationship was not demonstrated. There were no differences between the treatment and placebo groups for any of the adverse effects or laboratory variables reported at baseline or during the trial period. Four patients were withdrawn because of adverse reactions: 2 developed a skin rash while receiving olsalazine and 2 had diarrhea, one while on olsalazine and the other while on placebo. The data suggest that olsalazine is effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and is well tolerated among patients intolerant to sulfasalazine.\r"

Primary gastric cancers were first analyzed by deoxyribonucleic acid transfection assay using NIH/3T3 cells as recipients and by restriction enzyme analysis, which detects point mutations at codon 12 of the H-ras gene. None of seven tumors analyzed scored as positive. Furthermore, none of them had ras p21 with altered electrophoretic mobility on immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, confirming the absence of ras oncogenes activated by point mutations in these tumors. However, in 6 of 7 tumors, the amounts of p21 exceeded that in human placenta. Amplification of the K-ras gene was found in 1 of 11 (including the 7 described above) gastric cancers. Immunohistochemical analysis of ras p21 expression in these 11 tumors was then carried out using the anti-ras p21 monoclonal antibody RAP-5. All cancers showed more reactivity with RAP-5 than did normal mucosa adjacent to the cancers, indicating increased expression of ras p21. These results indicated that transformation of the stomach mucosa from the normal to the malignant phenotype is rarely associated with activation of ras genes by point mutations, but is frequently associated with enhanced expression of ras p21.\r"

As a result, the donor livers in these 2 cases were 29%-59% smaller than would be expected had the donor liver and recipient been matched ideally. The liver grafts in the recipients steadily increased in size, as determined by serial computed tomography scanning, to achieve new volumes consistent with those that would have been expected in a normal individual of the recipient's size, sex, and age. Fasting plasma levels of amino acids, glucagon, insulin, and standard liver injury tests were monitored to determine which measure best reflected the changes observed in the size of the grafts over time. No relationship between the changes observed in any of these parameters and hepatic growth was apparent. In both cases, the liver increased in volume at a rate of approximately 70 ml/day. These data demonstrate that a small-for-size liver transplanted into a larger recipient increases in size at a rate of approximately 70 ml/day until it achieves a liver volume consistent with that expected given the recipient's size, age, and sex.\r"

Whereas 81% of the animal studies had a positive outcome (improvement in survival), only 7.7% of the human studies showed a positive outcome on survival. Most animal studies suffered from a protocol in which treatment was not significantly delayed after induction of acute pancreatitis. Of the 12 human studies that showed no effect of treatment on survival, none had sufficient statistical power (1 - beta error) for the investigators to have confidence in the negative outcomes. This was due to the fact that the studies had too few patients or that the event rates in the untreated populations were too low. Only five of the human studies reported the complication rates of acute pancreatitis in patients who did not die of their disease. Treatment (by any agent) did not improve the complication rate in these studies, but only one of the five reports had sufficient statistical power for the investigators to have confidence in these negative results. Large multicenter studies with sufficient numbers of patients with severe pancreatitis (high mortality and complication rates) are needed to evaluate new therapies in this disease.\r"

Loops of rabbit ileum were filled in vivo with saline, non-enteropathogenic P-fimbriate E coli (PFEC), or EPEC. After 45 minutes the loops were washed, then mucosal biopsies were taken and cultured for up to 48 hours. The earliest changes discernable by electron microscopy were observed at 18 hours postinfection, at which time EPEC were closely adherent to the surface of enterocytes at the base of microvilli, some of which were elongated. By 24 hours postinfection there were large areas of brush border effacement with pedestal formation around the EPEC. No such damage was seen in biopsies from the control loops (saline, PFEC), and intracellular ultrastructure was extremely well preserved in all preparations for up to 48 hours. While there were no differences at eight hours, biochemical analyses at 24 hours postinfection showed a marked increase in the release of brush border enzymes into the culture medium from EPEC-infected explants compared to explants from the control loops. These findings provide morphological and biochemical evidence for damage to the microvillus membrane by EPEC, and validate organ culture of rabbit ileum as a model for the investigation of EPEC-pathogenicity.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews recent psychological studies of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or 'functional abdominal pain'. Many studies have used unreliable or invalid methods of assessment and some have confused personality with treatable psychiatric illness. Reliable and valid measures have indicated that 40-50% of patients with recently diagnosed functional abdominal pain have demonstrable psychiatric illness; these patients have a worse prognosis than those who are psychologically normal. When psychiatric disorder is diagnosed in a patient with IBS there are three possibilities: (1) The patient may have developed abdominal and psychiatric symptoms simultaneously in which case treatment of the latter may relieve the bowel symptoms. (2) Psychiatric disorder may precipitate increased concern about bowel symptoms, and consequent attendance at the gastroenterology clinic, of those with chronic mild symptoms. In this case it is illness behaviour, rather than abdominal symptoms, that is caused by the anxiety/depression. (3) Those with chronic neurotic symptoms as part of their personality must be screened for organic disease if they have a fresh onset of bowel symptoms; but they are at high risk of becoming persistent clinic attenders. Further research is needed to clarify when psychological abnormalities play a role in the aetiology of IBS and when they are coincidental, but lead to illness behaviour. The role of psychological factors in the aetiology of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is far from clear, but a review of the literature suggests that some consistent patterns are emerging in spite of methodological problems. There have been three major defects with studies that have linked IBS with neurotic symptomatology. First, the measurement of psychological factors has generally been imprecise. Second, most studies have considered IBS patients as a single group, without making allowance for differing symptom patterns. Third, conclusions have been drawn about hospital samples and extrapolated to all IBS subjects, without taking account of factors which affect consulting behaviour. Most studies have been concerned with psychological factors so these will be considered in most detail.\r"

  ".W": "Many different dosage schedules of antisecretory drugs for the treatment of duodenal ulcer are recommended. The relationship between degree of acid suppression and therapeutic efficacy has not been precisely defined for these drugs. We have examined the association between suppression of intragastric acidity and duodenal ulcer healing rates for a number of therapeutic regimens. For the H2 receptor antagonists alone, the most significant correlation with healing rates was with suppression of intragastric acidity at night (r = 0.926; p = 0.0001). When other classes of drug: high dose antacid, omeprazole and a synthetic prostaglandin (enprostil) were included in the analysis, the closest correlation was with suppression of total 24 hour intragastric acidity (r = 0.911; p less than 0.0001). Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relative contributions to healing of suppression of acidity during the day and night. Suppression of nocturnal acidity was found to be the single most important factor in explaining healing rates. No further benefit was obtained with daytime suppression for H2 receptor antagonists; suppression of acidity at night accounted for 86.1% of the observed variation in healing rates among different regimens of H2 receptor antagonists. When all classes of drugs were analysed, inclusion of daytime suppression produced a significant improvement in correlation over nocturnal suppression alone. Drug regimens providing potent suppression of nocturnal acidity produce the highest healing rates in controlled clinical trials. The healing rate for any dose regimen of an antisecretory drug can be predicted from a knowledge of its effect on intragastric acidity. For the H2 receptor antagonists, suppression of nocturnal acidity is the most relevant in this context.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The validity of the technique was initially confirmed by applying it to resected gastric carcinomas. Thirty seven endoscopically visualised lesions were then sampled by forceps biopsy, brush and needle cytology. Ten lesions were subsequently found to be carcinomas. Needle aspiration produced identifiable malignant cells from seven of these lesions. In two it was the only sampling method which provided the correct diagnosis. This technique may be a useful addition to conventional endoscopic sampling methods, particularly where tumours lie deep to normal mucosa, or necrotic slough.\r"

Using pH 4 as a cut off limit, the ambulant and recumbent periods of pH monitoring were more discriminatory than the postprandial period. Furthermore, it was possible to get complete separation between patients and normal subjects using several combinations of two reflux variables. Another group of 30 patients and 30 controls were investigated. Using percentage time at pH less than 4 as a single determinant of gastro-oesophageal reflux, the sensitivity and specificity were 87% and 97%, respectively, with 3.4% as upper limit for normality. Twenty four hour oesophageal pH monitoring in an ambulatory outpatient environment afforded clinically useful diagnostic accuracy in separating patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease from asymptomatic controls.\r"

  ".W": "An increased influx and/or a decreased extrusion of calcium across the plasma membrane resulting in an increase in cytosolic-free calcium could play an important role in the initiation of irreversible cell injury. Therefore, the translocation of calcium across the plasma membrane was probed in the perfused rat liver using multiple indicator dilution methodology. The sucrose space corresponding to the extracellular space amounted to 0.35 +/- 0.13 ml per gm liver, and the water space corresponding to the extra- and intracellular spaces was 0.97 +/- 0.08 ml per gm. The calcium space was always slightly larger (0.42 +/- 0.10 ml per gm) than the sucrose space. The calcium space further increased during perfusion with the calcium ionophore A 23187, whereas the sucrose space remained unchanged. Two hours after administration to intact rats of acetaminophen (2 gm per kg) and carbon tetrachloride (2 ml per kg), respectively, the calcium space had increased markedly relative to the sucrose space and relative to the water space, indicating an increased accessibility of the cells to extracellular calcium. Similarly, reperfusion of livers after 90 min of ischemia was associated with an increase in calcium space relative to the sucrose and water spaces. These studies indicate that, in three models of acute liver injury, the net influx of calcium across the plasma membrane is increased early in the evolution of the injury before irreversible damage occurs.\r"

  ".U": "88056760\r", 
  ".W": "The hepatocyte plasma membrane presents a morphological and functional regionalization into three domains: the sinusoidal; the lateral, and the canalicular. The mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis and maintenance of this regionalization are poorly understood. In this work, we have used colchicine and phalloidin, two drugs known to interfere with the secretory processes in hepatocytes, to study whether they also affect the transport of membrane proteins. The localization of three plasma membrane antigens was studied by light and electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies identifying either the sinusoidal (A39) or the lateral (B1) or the canalicular (B10) domains in normal hepatocytes. In rats injected with colchicine (0.25 mg per 100 gm), A39 moved from the sinusoidal membrane to the lateral and canalicular ones, whereas B10 was displaced from the canalicular to the sinusoidal and lateral membranes, resulting after 8 hr in an almost equal labeling of the three domains with both antibodies. In rats injected daily for 7 days with phalloidin (50 micrograms per 100 gm), A 39 became mainly localized on the bile canalicular membrane instead of the sinusoidal one; B10 predominated on the canalicular membrane as in controls but in places it labeled the sinusoidal and lateral domains as well. In bile duct-ligated rats studied for comparison for 4, 10 or 21 days, A39 and B10 localizations evolved as after phalloidin, but the changes were more marked. B1 was not affected by any of the treatments. In conclusion, colchicine, phalloidin and bile duct ligation do not seem to hinder the antigens in reaching the plasma membrane, but induce a redistribution of two of them, suggesting a disturbance in the biogenesis and/or control of the plasma membrane regionalization. Such an abnormal distribution could be involved in--or contribute to--the initiation of cholestasis.\r"

  ".W": "Since the liver is thought to be the major organ for the metabolism of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin cascade, we examined the kinetics and regulation of renin extraction by the isolated perfused rat liver. Partially purified, hog kidney renin was continuously infused into isolated rat livers perfused in a nonrecirculating manner with serum-free medium. Concentrations of renin in the portal and hepatic veins were measured by radioimmunoassay and first-pass hepatic extraction calculated. In livers from normal rats, steady-state, first-pass hepatic extraction of porcine renin ranged from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 25.5 +/- 3.9% of the infused dose; at high renin infusion rates, hepatic extraction was saturable. Administration of captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, decreased hepatic extraction of renin by approximately 60%; enalaprilat, another converting enzyme inhibitor, had no effect. First-pass hepatic extraction of renin was also inhibited by the bile acid, taurocholate, in a dose-dependent manner. However, bilateral nephrectomy, which reduced endogenous plasma renin activity to unmeasurable levels, had no significant effect on hepatic extraction of renin by livers isolated from nephrectomized rats. These results demonstrate directly that the liver extracts renin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, although the precise mechanism of uptake remains to be determined.\r"

Twenty-five cirrhotic patients experiencing 28 episodes of acute hepatic encephalopathy were randomized blindly to treatment with either lactitol (n = 15) or lactulose (n = 13). The sugars were dispensed in solutions identical in appearance, taste and pH and of similar osmolarity, which contained either 66.7 gm per 100 ml lactitol or 66.7 ml (44.5 gm) per 100 ml lactulose syrup. The initial dose of 0.75 ml per kg was adjusted to produce two semisoft stools per day. Patients were assessed every 12 hr for 5 days. There were no significant differences in sex ratio, age, body weight, clinical status, duration and extent of coma, etiology of liver disease or of hepatic encephalopathy between the two groups of patients on entry to the trial. An adequate catharsis was obtained with an equivalent mean (+/- 1 S.D.) daily dose of 26 +/- 5 gm lactitol or 31 +/- 7 ml (21 +/- 5 gm) lactulose syrup. During the trial, significant improvements occurred in clinical status and psychometric performance and in the electroencephalogram mean cycle frequencies in the majority of patients in both groups. At the end of the trial, 67% of the patients in the lactitol group and 69% of the lactulose group were clinically normal.

The present study was undertaken to examine the therapeutic efficacy of a newly developed soluble glucan, in combination with cyclophosphamide in the treatment of hepatic metastatic disease. Male C57Bl/6J mice were injected subcutaneously on Day 0 with 1 x 10(4) sarcoma cells. Glucan (200 mg per kg i.v.), cyclophosphamide (45 mg per kg i.p.) or glucan and cyclophosphamide were administered beginning on Day 20, when hepatic metastases were evident, and continued at 3-day intervals up to Day 50. Combined therapy with glucan and cyclophosphamide resulted in reduction of hepatic metastatic lesions on Day 36, compared to control. Survival data revealed that the combination of glucan and cyclophosphamide significantly (p less than 0.001) extended median survival time and the time to 100% mortality in an additive fashion, when compared to either therapy alone. Glucan-cyclophosphamide therapy was also effective in decreasing primary tumor weight to a level that was significantly (p less than 0.05) less than when therapy was initiated. In vitro studies revealed that Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity against sarcoma was increased (p less than 0.05) following glucan and cyclophosphamide. Glucan and cyclophosphamide also enhanced bone marrow proliferation and splenocyte response to mitogens in vitro. Additionally, glucan was observed to exert a direct cytostatic effect on sarcoma in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcium movement across plasma membranes occurs mainly by three routes: voltage-dependent calcium channels, adenosine 5'-triphosphate-driven calcium pump, and Na+-Ca2 exchange. The regulation of the intracellular ionized calcium is the consequence of two parallel calcium transport mechanisms: a high affinity, low capacity system responsible for extruding calcium during resting conditions (calcium pump) and a low affinity and high capacity system (Na+-Ca2 antiporter). This last system is designed to extrude calcium ions when intracellular calcium rises above certain levels and also to lead calcium ions into the cell under conditions that favor the reverse mode of operation of the exchanger. This short review provides an analysis of the most conspicuous features of the two membrane transport mechanisms determined in dialyzed squid axons with special emphasis on both the complexity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system and its marked asymmetry.\r"

  ".U": "88057424\r", 
  ".W": "Environmental factors, genetic polymorphisms, and different experimental designs have been the main impediments to evaluating a genetic association between cell membrane cation transport abnormalities and human essential or genetic hypertension. We review the results obtained in the Milan hypertensive strain of rats (MHS) and in its appropriate control normotensive strain (MNS) to illustrate our approach to defining the role of cation transport abnormality in a type of genetic hypertension. Before the development of a difference in blood pressure between the two strains, the comparison of kidney and erythrocyte functions showed that MHS had an increased glomerular filtration rate and urinary output, and lower plasma renin and urine osmolality. Kidney cross-transplantation between the strains showed that hypertension is transplanted with the kidney. Proximal tubular cell volume and sodium content were lower in MHS while sodium transport across the brush border membrane vesicles of MHS was faster. Erythrocytes in MHS were smaller and had lower sodium concentration, and Na+-K+ cotransport and passive permeability were faster. The differences in volume, sodium content, and Na+-K+ cotransport between erythrocytes of the two strains persisted after transplantation of bone marrow to irradiated F1 (MHS X MNS) hybrids. Moreover, in normal segregating F2 hybrid populations there was a positive correlation between blood pressure and Na+-K+ cotransport. These results suggest a genetic and functional link in MHS between cell membrane cation transport abnormalities and hypertension. Thus erythrocyte cell membrane may be used for approaching the problem of defining the genetically determined molecular mechanism underlying the development of a type of essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Many recent investigations of the mechanism of volume-expansion natriuresis fail to appreciate that the observed renal sodium excretion may not be dependent on an increase in intravascular volume, but rather on the infused sodium load or extracellular fluid volume expansion. With this in mind, the natriuresis of isotonic volume expansion, hypertonic saline infusion, and dehydration have a common basis: they present a relative or absolute sodium load. Lesions of forebrain periventricular tissue prevent the natriuretic response to these three states of body fluid imbalance. In this review we discuss the evidence for a common central nervous system-mediated natriuretic mechanism in response to disturbances of fluid and electrolyte balance. We also propose a role for pars intermedia-derived, proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides as humoral mediators of renal sodium excretion. Evidence from our laboratory, as well as others, provides data for a testable hypothesis to explain central nervous system-mediated natriuresis, as well as an explanation of how central nervous system lesions or neurochemical perturbations affect the renal response to body fluid imbalance.\r"

However, integration of nursing diagnoses into the critical care literature has not progressed as much as have other components of the movement. All three nursing diagnosis activities are interdependent, and without infiltration the whole process is slowed. We believe that the process of infiltration through the literature could be greatly accelerated if the recommendations presented here were implemented. This increasing infiltration of nursing diagnoses through the literature would then have a positive effect on all other concurrent activities involved in the nursing diagnosis movement.\r"

The shortened abductors and flexors are released proximally and excision of the upper third of the ilium allows them to be repaired without tension, while providing bone graft to reconstruct the acetabular roof. We report 12 such replacements in 10 patients with good results and few early complications.\r"

Compared to adipocytes from women, omental adipocytes from men were characterized by 1) 2-fold larger cell volume; 2) 4- to 5- and 2.5-fold higher glucose transport rates when calculated per cell or per cell surface area, respectively, in either basal or insulin-stimulated cells; 3) similar 2-fold insulin stimulating effect per se; and 4) equal concentrations of transporters in both fractions examined, but a 2-fold increase in their total number per cell. Additionally, although not directly measured, the calculated glucose transporter activity in basal plasma membranes prepared from adipocytes from men was 2.7-fold higher than that in women, and insulin further induced a 30% increase in that activity. Thus, a sex-related difference was found between the number of glucose transporters per cell and the resultant glucose transport activity of the intact cells. Together with the increased specific activity of glucose transporters in men compared to women, our findings indicate a sex-related difference in adipocyte glucose transport, mainly due to an increase in the number and modulation of the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "In adult women, estradiol (E2) sensitizes the pituitary to GnRH. To assess whether this effect develops during intrauterine life, dispersed pituitary cells from second trimester male and female fetuses were cultured on extracellular matrix-coated plates. E2 (10(-8) mol/L) exposure for 72 h resulted in a significant increase in LH release when cells were stimulated with GnRH and caused a significant shift to the left of the dose-response curve for GnRH-stimulated LH release [relative potency ratio, 0.33 +/- 0.05 (+/- SE)]. E2-enhanced LH release was not associated with an increase in cell number, total LH content, or percentage of LH-containing cells (immunocytochemistry). The EC50 of GnRH-stimulated LH release and the degree of E2 sensitization were not sex dependent, although female fetal pituitary cells in the absence of E2 had significantly greater LH content and released more LH under basal and GnRH-stimulated conditions than cells from male fetuses. Therefore, E2 sensitization of second trimester human fetal gonadotrophs to GnRH does occur, is not influenced by sex, and may involve an acutely releasable LH pool. At these gestational ages, basal and maximal GnRH-stimulated LH release as well as total LH content are greater in the female than the male. Thus, E2 sensitization of GnRH responsiveness appears to have its origins during intrauterine fetal life.\r"

  ".W": "The human fetal pancreas (HFP) is a potential source of insulin-producing B-cells for transplantation to insulin-dependent diabetic patients. We recently described a technique for culturing HFP tissue in vitro which results in the development of islet-like cell clusters (ICC). These clusters exhibited (pro)insulin biosynthesis and a modest rate of insulin secretion, and immunocytochemical staining indicated the presence of insulin-positive cells in the cell clusters. In this study this technique was used to evaluate the effects of the addition of 1000 micrograms/L GH to HFP cultured in medium RPMI-1640 plus 10% human serum. ICCs developed in 21 of 33 consecutive cultures. GH increased the yield of ICC by 35% compared to explants supplemented with human serum alone. The insulin content of the ICCs also was increased, but the size of individual ICCs was not affected by GH, as reflected by an unchanged DNA content. GH also caused increased insulin release when the ICCs were stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose plus 5 mM theophylline. However, (pro)insulin biosynthesis was not affected by the addition of GH. These results suggest that GH stimulates the formation of both ICCs and insulin production within the explants. These observations are relevant both for the production of human fetal B-cells intended for transplantation into insulin-dependent diabetic patients and for our knowledge of the growth regulation of the HFP B-cell.\r"

In this study, several ACTH-stimulating factors, such as CRH, arginine vasopressin (AVP), epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine, in addition to ACTH, cortisol, and glucose, were simultaneously measured in plasma before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after iv administration of 0.1 U/kg BW regular insulin to seven normal subjects. Insulin administration resulted in significant rises in the mean plasma ACTH level from 4.6 +/- 1.1 (+/- SEM) to 21.6 +/- 4.8 pmol/L at 30 min (P less than 0.01) and in plasma cortisol from 330 +/- 60 to 720 +/- 50 nmol/L at 60 min (P less than 0.01). These increases were preceded by a 41.0 +/- 1.9% (P less than 0.001) fall in blood glucose levels. The mean plasma CRH level rose significantly from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 pmol/L (P less than 0.01) at 30 min and remained elevated until 120 min. In addition, concomitant and significant rises in plasma AVP levels (basal, 1.5 +/- 0.01; peak, 4.5 +/- 1.1 pmol/L at 30 min; P less than 0.01), E (basal, less than 50; peak, 640 +/- 130 pmol/L at 30 min; P less than 0.01), and NE (basal, 0.07 +/- 0.01; peak, 0.17 +/- 0.03 nmol/L at 60 min; P less than 0.05), but not dopamine, also occurred. These results suggest that multiple ACTH-releasing factors, such as CRH, AVP, E, and NE, are involved in ACTH secretion induced by insulin-induced hypoglycemia in man.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of continuous sc infusion of a GnRH agonist (Ag) and testosterone (T) supplementation on spermatogenesis and the potential fertilizing capacity of sperm in 15 rhesus monkeys. The monkeys were divided into 3 groups of 5 animals each. Groups 1 and 2 received 25 micrograms/day Ag for 44 weeks. Group 2 also received T replacement therapy [sufficient to maintain serum T values within the normal range; 4-5 ng/mL (13.9-17.3 nmol/L)]. Group 3 received a low dose of the Ag (5 micrograms/day for 24 weeks and then 10 micrograms/day for 20 weeks) to prolong the oligospermic phase before the onset of azoospermia. In groups 1 and 3, there was an initial transient (1 week) rise in serum LH and T levels which then fell below pretreatment value where they remained throughout the treatment period. The serum LH and T levels were lower in the group treated with 25 micrograms/day Ag. Similar changes in serum LH levels occurred in group 2, but T supplementation maintained serum T in the physiological range. The decline in serum LH levels was associated with reduced sensitivity to GnRH, since the responses of serum LH and T to GnRH were either abolished or greatly reduced in the 2 groups treated with 25 micrograms/day Ag and were less than 50% of the pre-Ag responses in monkeys treated with 5-10 micrograms/day Ag. Four of five monkeys treated with 25 micrograms/day Ag alone became azoospermic within 21 weeks. All five animals receiving Ag and T supplementation became azoospermic (mean time to onset, 12.6 weeks). Four of five monkeys treated with 5-10 micrograms/day Ag also had azoospermic ejaculates during the late treatment and early recovery period. Sperm counts recovered to the pretreatment levels in most monkeys by 10 weeks of the recovery period. The quality of semen samples taken from oligospermic monkeys was greatly reduced. The percentage of motile and percentage of live sperm per ejaculate, the net negative surface charge on sperm, and the scores of sperm in the hamster oocyte penetration test were subnormal. T supplementation did not improve these measures of semen quality. Testicular biopsies taken at the end of the Ag administration period from monkeys given 25 micrograms/day Ag showed diffuse atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, which contained primarily Sertoli cells and a few spermatogonia and spermatocytes, but no spermatids. The tubular atrophy and the suppression of spermatogenesis did not appear to be influenced by T replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We found that human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) activate prorenin at a neutral pH. Prorenin was partially purified from human amniotic fluid, and its activation was measured by the release of angiotensin I from sheep angiotensinogen. In control experiments, thermolysin was the standard activator. PMN cells were separated from blood and, after N2 cavitation or degranulation by cytochalasin, were fractionated by differential centrifugation. Elastase and cathepsin G activities were determined with synthetic fluorescent substrates. The activators of prorenin concentrated in the azurophil granules were released by Triton; most of the activation was due to elastase. Elastase, purified from human PMN, activated prorenin completely. The activation by the granular fraction was inhibited 77% by a specific elastase inhibitor in the presence of a detergent, but only 22% by a cathepsin G inhibitor. After inhibition of elastase, the residual activity was inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate; thus, it was due to a serine protease(s) such as cathepsin G. We suggest that human renin fully activated by elastase may still contain an N-terminal pentapeptide fragment of the propeptide.\r"

We investigated the effect of GRP on the secretion of pituitary hormones and cortisol in normal men. GRP was infused iv as primed infusions of 0.12 pmol/kg BW. min for 30 min (GRP I) and 1.50 pmol/kg. min for an additional 30 min (GRP II). GRP dose-dependently stimulated ACTH secretion compared with the effect of saline [net change in ACTH (delta ACTH) before and after treatment: GRP I, 3 +/- 1 (+/- SEM) vs. 0 +/- 1 pmol/L (P less than 0.05); GRP II, 5 +/- 1 vs. -3 +/- 1 pmol/L; P less than 0.01)]. A further increase in plasma ACTH concentration occurred after cessation of GRP infusion (7 +/- 2 vs. 0 +/- 1 pmol/L; P less than 0.025). GRP caused a similar dose-dependent stimulation of cortisol secretion compared with the effect of saline [delta cortisol before and after treatment: GRP I, -19 +/- 21 vs. -68 +/- 14 nmol/L (P less than 0.05); GRP II, 38 +/- 33 vs. -86 +/- 15 nmol/L (P less than 0.005)]. The serum cortisol concentration increased further after cessation of the GRP infusion (72 +/- 31 vs. -124 +/- 33 nmol/L; P less than 0.0025). GRP dose-dependently stimulated beta-endorphin immunoreactivity compared with the effect of saline [delta beta-endorphin immunoreactivity before and after treatment: GRP I, 6 +/- 1 vs. -3 +/- 1 pmol/L (P less than 0.01); GRP II, 11 +/- 4 vs. -6 +/- 2 pg/mL (P less than 0.025)].

In human kidneys, specific staining was found only along the basolateral membrane of the distal convoluted tubules. Glomeruli and other segments of the nephron did not stain. Staining of erythrocytes in human spleen was readily observed. Human small intestine, human parathyroid, and human liver showed no antigens that crossreacted with the antibodies to Ca++-Mg++ATPase. Specific staining of distal tubule basolateral membranes from the kidney of a chimpanzee was also noted. Our experiments show, for the first time, that basolateral membranes of the human distal convoluted tubule contain a protein that is immunologically similar to the human erythrocyte Ca++-Mg++ATPase. These observations suggest that the cells of the distal convoluted tubules of human kidney may have a calcium pump similar to that of human erythrocyte membranes.\r"

We have identified and purified the adherence lectin by two methods: affinity columns derivatized with galactose monomers or galactose terminal glycoproteins, and affinity columns and immunoblots prepared with monoclonal antibodies that inhibit amebic adherence. By both methods the adherence lectin was identified as a 170-kD secreted and membrane-bound amebic protein. The surface location of the lectin was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Purified lectin competitively inhibited amebic adherence to target cells by binding to receptors on the target Chinese hamster ovary cells in a Gal-inhibitable manner.\r"

E. coli was used in the present studies as an \"osmosensor\" to detect osmoprotective activity in mammalian tissues. The greatest activity was found in extracts of renal inner medulla and to a lesser extent in the renal outer medulla and cortex of several mammalian species. Liver extracts were more active than other nonrenal tissues. Bacterial osmoprotective activity and concentration of glycine betaine in the renal inner medulla of rabbits were found to correlate closely with urinary osmolarity. Concentrations of sorbitol were found to be also increased in the renal inner medulla during osmotic stress, but this compound is not osmoprotective for E. coli. Glycine and proline betaine were recovered in urine of rabbits and were increased in those given high osmotic loads. Only small amounts of proline betaine were recovered in the renal inner medulla. The source from which proline betaine is derived is unknown.\r"

  ".U": "88059564\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study, we have evaluated how plasma fibronectin (FN) and tissue FN can affect the clearance from the circulation and organ uptake of antigen or immune complexes (IC) that have the capacity to bind to FN. Phenylated gelatin (DNP-GL) (a FN binding antigen) and IC composed of DNP-GL and monoclonal IgGl anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) antibodies were tested. These probes were compared with DNP-bovine serum albumin (BSA) (a non-FN-binding antigen) and DNP-BSA IC formed with the same anti-DNP antibody used for the preparation of DNP-GL IC. We found evidence that DNP-GL, but not DNP-BSA, formed complexes with soluble FN in vitro and the data strongly suggest that DNP-GL-FN complexes form in vivo. The formation of complexes with plasma FN aided in the clearance of DNP-GL from the circulation, as shown by the facts that DNP-GL was removed from the circulation much faster than DNP-BSA and that complexes of DNP-GL with plasma FN were removed from the circulation faster than uncomplexed DNP-GL. The sites of deposition of DNP-GL were also different from those of DNP-BSA. Thus, DNP-GL demonstrated higher hepatic, splenic, and renal uptake than did DNP-BSA. Renal uptake of DNP-GL was quite high despite the fact that DNP-GL is anionic. Indeed, expressed per gram of tissue, liver and kidney deposition of DNP-GL was not significantly different. By immunofluorescence microscopy, DNP-GL could be demonstrated in hepatic sinusoids and glomerular mesangium. In vitro, DNP-GL bound to FN in the mesangium of frozen sections of kidney tissue. IC formed with DNP-GL or DNP-BSA demonstrated virtually the same size, yet the fate of DNP-GL IC was strikingly different from that of DNP-BSA IC. The removal of DNP-GL IC from the circulation was mediated by the antigen and not by Fc receptors since gelatin (an inhibitor of DNP-GL clearance) but not aggregated IgG (an inhibitor of Fc receptors) inhibited the removal of DNP-GL IC from the circulation. In summary, these studies suggest that the ability of an antigen or IC to bind to FN markedly influences the fate of that antigen or IC. Specifically, binding to FN accelerates clearance from the circulation and favors hepatic and renal (primarily mesangial) uptake of the FN binding antigen of IC.\r"

Steady-state NE specific activity in arterialized plasma during [3H]NE infusion and postinfusion plasma disappearance of [3H]NE were measured in eight healthy subjects in the supine and upright positions. Two exponentials were clearly identified in the plasma [3H]NE disappearance curves of each subject studied in the supine (r = 0.94-1.00, all P less than 0.01) and upright (r = 0.90-0.98, all P less than 0.01) positions. A two-compartment model was the minimal model necessary to simultaneously describe the kinetics of NE in the supine and upright positions. The NE input rate into the extravascular compartment 2, estimated with the minimal model, increased with upright posture (1.87 +/- 0.08 vs. 3.25 +/- 0.2 micrograms/min per m2, P less than 0.001). Upright posture was associated with a fall in the volume of distribution of NE in compartment 1 (7.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.3 liters, P less than 0.001), and as a result of that, there was a fall in the metabolic clearance rate of NE from compartment 1 (1.80 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.08 liters/min per m2, P less than 0.001). We conclude that a two-compartment model is the minimal model that can accurately describe the kinetics of distribution and metabolism of NE in humans.\r"

The immunoinfertile sera demonstrated a strong reaction with FA-1 when compared with fertile control sera. There was no correlation between the reaction of sera with FA-1 and the titers obtained through the sperm agglutination technique and the sperm immobilization technique. Immunoinfertile sera showed binding with the protein bands in the regions corresponding to FA-1 on Western blots involving sodium deoxycholate-solubilized human sperm. Antigens isolated with immunoaffinity chromatography involving immunoinfertile sera also demonstrated antigen bands corresponding to FA-1 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Of the seven immunoinfertile couples, three that had antibodies to FA-1 in the male as well as female partners demonstrated a block of fertilization (IVF) due to antibodies bound on the sperm surface. The anti-FA-1 antibody activity was detected in serum as well as in follicular fluid and seminal plasma. Immunoinfertile sera that showed an inhibition of human sperm penetration of zona-free hamster ova showed a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in penetration rates after absorption with FA-1. These results indicate that sera from immunoinfertile patients had antibodies reacting with FA-1, and these antibodies are involved in the fertilization process.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography was used for comparing the binding of labeled somatostatin-14 (S-14) and somatostatin-28 (S-28 section) to islet cells. Monolayer cultures of rat islet cells were incubated with [125I-Tyr11]S-14 (S-14 section) or [125I-Leu8, D-Trp22, Tyr25]S-28 (S-28 section) in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled peptides. Autoradiographic grains (ARG) associated with individual islet cells were identified and expressed as the mean number per B, A, and D cells. Specific ARG associated with S-14 were found over B and A cells. S-28 section-related specific ARG were concentrated over B, A, as well as D cells. The highest density of S-14 section labeling occurred over A cells, which under conditions of maximum labeling (37 degrees C for 60 min) contained five times as many ARG as did B cells. By contrast, under the same incubation conditions, the labeling density with S-28 section was maximal over B cells, which contained four and five times as many grains as A and D cells, respectively. These observations show preferential association of S-14 section with the A cell and S-28 section with the B cel provide strong evidence for the existence of separate binding sites for S-14 section and S-28 section on A and B cells, respectively, which presumably mediate the previously reported glucagon selective inhibitory effect of S-14 and the insulin-selective action of S-28.\r"

  ".W": "Human phosphofructokinase (PFK) exists in tetrameric isozymic forms, at least in vitro. Muscle and liver contain homotetramers M4 and L4, respectively, whereas red cells contain five isozymes composed of M (muscle) and L (liver) type subunits, i.e., M4, M3L, M2L2, and ML3, and L4. Homozygous deficiency of muscle PFK results in the classic glycogen storage disease type VII characterized by exertional myopathy and hemolytic syndrome beginning in early childhood. The genetic lesion results in a total and partial loss of muscle and red cell PFK, respectively. Characteristically, the residual red cell PFK from the patients consists of isolated L4 isozyme; the M-containing hybrid isozymes are completely absent. In this study, we investigated an 80-yr-old man who presented with a 10-yr history of progressive weakness of the lower limbs as the only symptom. The residual red cell PFK showed the presence of a few M-containing isozymes in addition to the predominant L4 species, indicating that the genetic lesion is a \"leaky\" mutation of the gene coding for the M subunit. The presence of a small amount of enzyme activity in the muscle may account for the atypical myopathy in this patient.\r"

As demonstrated here, bFGF is also present in cultured human Ewing's sarcoma cells. Unexpectedly, however, bFGF isolated from these cells inhibits their own proliferation, indicating that bFGF can act as an endogenous (autocrine) growth inhibitor for cultured Ewing's sarcoma cells. Since bFGF also inhibits the proliferation of some further tumor cells, but stimulates that of others, it can be considered a bifunctional regulator of tumor cell proliferation. The autocrine growth-inhibitory effect of bFGF in Ewing's sarcoma cells may explain the low mitotic activity of Ewing's sarcomas.\r"

Cyclosporin had only minimal effects on the production of anti-islet cell antibodies whether directed to islet cytoplasmic (immunofluorescence) or membrane (cytotoxicity assay) antigens even in patients undergoing remission. These data suggest that these antibodies do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease particularly since their (irregular) presence is not predictive of the clinical response to cyclosporin. Conversely, cyclosporin completely suppressed the synthesis of antibodies elicited by exogenous insulin irrespective of the insulin doses received, and decreased the autoantibody production against thyroid antigens, indicating that cyclosporin has variable effects on antibody production against various antigens.\r"

  ".U": "88059616\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes and insulin on regulation of renal kallikrein were studied in the rat. 1 and 2 wk after STZ injection, diabetic rats had reduced renal levels and urinary excretion of active kallikrein. Tissue and urinary prokallikrein levels were unchanged, but the rate of renal prokallikrein synthesis relative to total protein synthesis was reduced 30-45% in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin prevented or reversed the fall in tissue level and excretion rate of active kallikrein and normalized prokallikrein synthesis rate. To further examine insulin's effects, nondiabetic rats were treated with escalating insulin doses to produce hyperinsulinemia. In these rats, renal active kallikrein increased. Although renal prokallikrein was not increased significantly by hyperinsulinemia, its synthesis was increased. As this was accompanied by proportionally increased total protein synthesis, relative kallikrein synthesis rate was not changed. Excretion of active kallikrein was unchanged, but prokallikrein excretion was markedly reduced. Therefore, increased tissue active kallikrein seen with hyperinsulinemia can be explained not only by increased synthesis but also by retention and increased activation of renal prokallikrein. These studies show that STZ diabetes produces an impairment in renal kallikrein synthesis and suggest that this disease state also impairs renal prokallikrein activation. The findings also suggest that insulin modulates renal kallikrein production, activation, and excretion.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of insulin and plasma amino acid concentrations on leucine kinetics in 15 healthy volunteers (age 22 +/- 2 yr) using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique and an infusion of [1-14C]leucine. Four different experimental conditions were examined: (a) study one, high insulin with reduced plasma amino acid concentrations; (b) study two, high insulin with maintenance of basal plasma amino acid concentrations; (c) study three, high insulin with elevated plasma amino acid concentrations; and (d) study four, basal insulin with elevated plasma amino acid concentrations. Data were analyzed using both the plasma leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate (the alpha-ketoacid of leucine) specific activities. In study one total leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of whole body protein synthesis) all decreased (P less than 0.01) regardless of the isotope model utilized. In study two leucine flux did not change, while leucine oxidation increased (P less than 0.01) and nonoxidative leucine disposal was maintained at the basal rate; endogenous leucine flux (an index of whole body protein degradation) decreased (P less than 0.01). In study three total leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disposal all increased significantly (P less than 0.01). In study four total leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disposal all increased (P less than 0.001), while endogenous leucine flux decreased (P less than 0.001). We conclude that: (a) hyperinsulinemia alone decreases plasma leucine concentration and inhibits endogenous leucine flux (protein breakdown), leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disposal (protein synthesis); (b) hyperaminoacidemia, whether in combination with hyperinsulinemia or with maintained basal insulin levels decreases endogenous leucine flux and stimulates both leucine oxidation and nonoxidative leucine disposal.\r"

Since then PUVA therapy has been found to be an effective modality in the treatment of many cutaneous conditions. When properly administered, the major short-term side effects are minimal. The long-term side effects may include an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, atypical cutaneous pigmentation, accelerated skin aging, and ophthalmologic abnormalities. By careful patient selection and limiting the cumulative UVA dosage and frequency by using combinations or alternative therapies, these side effects may be reduced. Continued reporting of carefully carried out long-term prospective studies will provide us with more knowledge of the long-term side effects of PUVA. In the meantime, for each patient on PUVA therapy the risk/benefit ratio should be carefully considered.\r"

This consists of a type of graft biologically and technically intermediate between Reverdin and Thiersh's types. We have named it the \"free laminar thin band graft.\" In contrast to the Thiersh graft, this simple surgical technique requires little equipment, and it can be done quickly and easily as an office procedure, with little risk to the patient. In addition, it is a low cost procedure. In our experience with this technique, healing time is shorter and lesions recur later than with the Reverdin graft. The authors describe the surgical method and report a clinical case.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the clinical significance of the occurrence of hemodynamic deterioration after the administration of calcium channel blocking drugs, nifedipine (20 mg orally) was administered to 29 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Thirteen patients showed hemodynamic improvement with the drug (Group 1), as shown by a notable increase in cardiac index associated with a modest decrease in mean arterial pressure. The other 16 patients exhibited hemodynamic deterioration after nifedipine (Group 2), as reflected by a decline in right and left ventricular stroke work indexes accompanied by a marked hypotensive response. These differences were not related to differences in the peripheral vascular response to nifedipine, because both groups showed similar decreases in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Groups 1 (hemodynamic improvement) and 2 (hemodynamic deterioration) were similar with respect to all demographic variables and pretreatment left ventricular performance (cardiac index, left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance). Yet, the 1 year actuarial survival in patients in Group 1 was substantially better than that in patients in Group 2 (67 versus 23%, p = 0.009). Group 2, however, had higher values for plasma renin activity (17.7 +/- 6.0 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mg/ml per h, p less than 0.05), lower values for serum sodium concentration (134.6 +/- 1.2 versus 139.2 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter, p less than 0.05) and higher values for mean right atrial pressure (15.8 +/- 2.0 versus 7.9 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than did patients in Group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four subjects (eight male and 16 female), aged 17 to 39 years (mean, 23.7 years), performed a 6-minute exercise on a bicycle ergometer at 75% of their maximum oxygen intake. FEV1 was measured at regular time intervals up to 8 hours after exercise. Seven subjects demonstrated a late asthmatic reaction defined as a fall in FEV1 greater than 10% between 2 to 8 hours. Bronchial reactivity to histamine was unchanged 24 hours after the exercise, compared to baseline. On a control day, a fall in FEV1 similar to the one observed after exercise was induced by methacholine inhalation. Measurements of FEV1 were done at the same time intervals as on exercise day. Neutrophil chemotactic activity was measured in the serum of 15 subjects, on exercise day for early responders, and on the 3 test days for subjects with a dual response. There was no difference between subjects with an isolated early or late response for age, sex, or atopic status. Baseline expiratory flows and nonspecific bronchial reactivity to histamine were similar in both groups. These results demonstrate the occurrence of a late asthmatic response in 30.4% of the population studied. There was no significant change of nonspecific bronchial responsiveness after the late asthmatic response to exercise. No significant increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity could be observed.\r"

One case is the first case of ABPA diagnosed in the United States in 1967. A second case has been observed through four stages of ABPA. None of these eight cases has demonstrated pulmonary deterioration by clinical, chest roentgenogram, or pulmonary function analysis. After diagnosis, the maintenance dose of prednisone in seven of eight cases was a low to moderate dose alternate-day prednisone. These results suggest that continuous observation and management of episodes of pulmonary consolidation or asthma exacerbations may prevent the progression of ABPA to stage V (fibrotic end stage). The total IgE may remain elevated in these patients, and therapy should not attempt to reduce total serum IgE to normal levels. After prolonged therapy with prednisone for asthma and control of ABPA, the IgE and IgG antibody indices against Aspergillus fumigatus may remain elevated or may be below the levels that are of diagnostic value.\r"

Two groups of subjects with asthma, one group with markedly reactive airways (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1, 0.07 mg/ml) and the other group with less reactive airways (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1, 3.83 mg/ml), had allergen bronchoprovocation. After challenge, bronchoconstriction was measured as change in specific airway conductance (SGaw), and mast cell-mediator release was measured as change in both plasma histamine and serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA). In the group with more reactive airways, allergen challenge, while it produced a mean fall in SGaw of 58.1%, was not associated with any significant increase in plasma histamine from a mean resting level of 3.69 nmol/L-1. In contrast, a comparable mean fall in SGaw of 52.4% in the group with less reactive airways was associated with a significant (p less than 0.005) increase in plasma histamine from 1.17 to 3.60 nmol/L-1, maximal 5 minutes after allergen challenge. There were, however, significant increments in serum NCA in both groups with asthma after allergen challenge. The changes in NCA in the group with less reactive airways (136.7 +/- 38.1% above baseline; p less than 0.01; 1% sera dilution) were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than changes identified in the group with more reactive airways (68.3% above baseline; p less than 0.01; 20% sera dilution). These findings directly support the concept that both mast cell-mediator release and nonspecific bronchial reactivity are separate factors that influence the airway response to inhaled allergen in asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In both experimental animals and humans, three stages of susceptibility to viral infections are apparent: 1) the neonatal state, characterized by enhanced susceptibility to infections; 2) childhood and adolescence, during which there is decreased susceptibility; and 3) adulthood (sexual maturity), characterized by increased susceptibility to primary viral infections with advancing age. Moreover, advanced age is associated with reactivation of latent viruses, most notably VZV, and, most likely, oncogenic viruses as well. The mechanisms responsible for these alterations in susceptibility to viral infections have not been completely elucidated. Differences in antibody production do not seem to play a role. Most authors feel that depression of cell-mediated immunity, as measured by delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity or lymphocyte stimulation by mitogens and antigens may be of importance. There have been, however, only few studies on the role of antiviral moieties, such as the interferon(s). Our data on interferon formation in response to coxsackievirus B3 infection in mice suggest that adult mice produce relatively less interferon in relation to the amount of virus replicated in their tissues than do younger animals. Furthermore, the absolute amount of interferon produced by adult animals in response to intravenous injection of (non-replicating virus) NDV was less than that found in younger mice. We report our studies on interferon with no implication that these data supply an adequate explanation for the greater vulnerability of adult mice infected with coxsackievirus B3. It is unlikely that the matter of age and susceptibility has interferon (or indeed any other factor) as a single determinant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A comparison of characteristics of smokers and nonsmokers revealed similar pretrial clinical findings. No significant differences between groups were found with regard to previous complications or recent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. There were also no significant differences in the way smokers and nonsmokers responded to treatment. Subjects on ranitidine, regardless of their smoking status, showed significantly greater improvement in heartburn symptoms and consumed less antacid than subjects who received placebo. Results of these analyses indicate that smoking as an independent variable was not related to symptomatic response or esophageal healing and that ranitidine was similarly effective in decreasing heartburn symptoms in smokers and nonsmokers.\r"

Indeed, enthusiastic battle lines have been drawn by those who employ the procedure and skeptics who are awaiting proof of its efficacy. On the sidelines is a fairly large group of medical \"fence-sitters,\" whose agnostic critiques keep the entire question lively and worth dissecting. EVS is not without complications, but it is not very difficult to perform. It can control active variceal hemorrhage and prevent rebleeding in stabilized patients. Its effect on survival seems to be related to the underlying liver disease, the endoscopist's ability to obliterate the varices, and treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic EVS may be helpful in carefully selected patients. We review current controversies about EVS and offer technical suggestions to improve efficacy and lower EVS-related morbidity and mortality.\r"

This lymphoma grew as multiple submucosal nodules, some of which had coalesced into a mass in the terminal ileum. Histologically, the lesion resembled a lymphoma of follicular center-cell origin except for germinal centers that appeared reactive and greatly expanded follicular mantles. Flow cytometric studies showed that the lymphoma contained a monoclonal, kappa+ population of B-lymphocytes. Evaluation of sections of frozen tissue by an immunoperoxidase technique revealed that the germinal centers were polyclonal (nonneoplastic) and that the neoplastic cells were confined to the mantle zone. The additional information led to classification of the neoplasm as the mantle zone variant of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma. This type of lymphoma may pursue a more aggressive course than a follicular lymphoma derived from the germinal center. We review our general approach to the analysis of hematolymphoid neoplasms and discuss how certain techniques may be useful adjuncts in the evaluation of these types of tumors.\r"

The B cells from both P1----P2 and P1----(P1 x P2)F1 chimeras could give rise to in vitro immunoglobulin M-producing cells upon stimulation with B151-TRF2 comparable in magnitude to that of normal P1 B cells, and their responses were inhibited by anti-I-AP1 but not by anti-I-AP2 monoclonal antibody even in the presence of mitomycin C-treated T cell-depleted P2 spleen cells as auxiliary cells. In contrast, the B151-TRF2 responses of P1 B cells isolated from both (P1 + P2)----(P1 x P2)F1 and (P1 + P2)----P1 double bone marrow chimeras became sensitive to the inhibition of not only anti-I-AP1 but also anti-I-AP2 monoclonal antibody only when the culture was conducted in the presence of P2 auxiliary cells, demonstrating that they adaptively differentiate to recognize as self-structures allogeneic as well as syngeneic Ia molecules. Moreover, the experiments utilizing B cells from H-2-congenic mice and B cell hybridoma clones as auxiliary cells revealed that B151-TRF2-responsive B cells recognize Ia molecules expressed on B cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that B151-TRF2-responsive B cells recognize Ia molecules expressed by B cells as self-structures and that their self-recognition specificity is dictated by the MHC haplotype of bone marrow cells present during the B cell ontogeny but not by the MHC haplotype of a radiation-resistant host environment.\r"

  ".W": "Clonal deletion of developing lymphocytes with potential reactivity for self is thought to play a crucial role in the establishment of self tolerance. One prediction of the clonal deletion hypothesis is that cells bearing receptors with high affinity for self are more likely than cells with low affinity receptors to be deleted from the repertoire. Experimental models of B cell tolerance have provided evidence for the preferential survival of low affinity cells with specificity for tolerogen in tolerant animals, but no comparable evidence exists for T cells. To examine this issue in T cells, cytotoxic T cell lines specific for the Kb mutant class I H-2 molecule, bm1, were generated from C57BL/6 mice rendered neonatally tolerant of bm1 and compared with anti-bm1 lines generated from normal mice. Compared with normal lines, those from tolerant mice differed in five ways: 1) they grew more slowly; 2) they were less efficient at lysing bm1 targets; 3) they showed different patterns of lysis against a panel of third party targets; 4) their cytotoxic activity against bm1 could be increased in the presence of leukoagglutinin, whereas the activity of normal lines was not increased by leukoagglutinin; and 5) their cytotoxic activity was more susceptible to inhibition by anti-Lyt-2 antibody. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the repertoire of the remaining tolerogen-specific cytotoxic T cells in neonatally tolerant mice is different from the normal C57BL/6 anti-bm1 repertoire, and the results are consistent with the idea that the remaining tolerogen-specific cells are low avidity cells that have preferentially escaped the clonal deletion process.\r"

  ".U": "88060415\r", 
  ".W": "The cluster designation (CD)4 molecule is one of several nonpolymorphic T lymphocyte surface proteins that have been implicated in T cell-target cell interactions, and is thought to play an important role in regulating T helper cell function. Previously, we found that gangliosides inhibited the function of rat T helper cell lines, and simultaneously inhibited the expression of the rat CD4 molecule identified by the W3/25 antibody. We have now evaluated the generality and mechanism(s) of ganglioside-induced modulation of CD4 expressed by mouse, rat, and human T helper lymphocytes. Ganglioside pretreatment induced rapid and selective disappearance of the CD4 molecule from T helper cells of all three species. The ganglioside effect was temperature- and dose-dependent, reversible within 24 hr of ganglioside removal, azide-insensitive, and was neutralized completely by 10% serum. CD4 modulation appeared to be a general property of gangliosides since the effect could be induced similarly by highly purified individual gangliosides with varying amounts of sialic acid, or by mixed gangliosides. The activity of gangliosides appeared to require both the lipid and sialated oligosaccharide moieties. Gangliosides did not inactivate antibody function, but prevented binding at the cell surface by 12 different monoclonal antibodies specific for a variety of different CD4 epitopes. Preclearance of CD4 by antibody-mediated capping reduced binding of 3H-GM1 to T helper cells. Labeled GM1 bound to several detergent-extracted and transblotted lymphocyte-associated proteins, but apparently did not bind directly to the CD4 molecule under these conditions. These results indicate that gangliosides induce a profound change in the molecular orientation of CD4 within the T helper cell membrane which renders epitopes on the CD4 molecule inaccessible to antibody. This ganglioside effect represents a novel pathway which may contribute to the understanding of the role of CD4 as a regulatory molecule and as a specific receptor for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant interleukins 1 alpha and 1 beta (rIL-1 alpha and -1 beta) both induced monophasic peripheral neutrophilia and lymphopenia in Lewis rats 1.5 hr after i.v. injection. The kinetics of rIL-1 alpha- and -1 beta-induced neutrophilia were similar to those induced by human monocyte-derived IL-1, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta, and the peripheral neutrophilia was accompanied by a marked decrease in marrow neutrophils. Arachidonic acid metabolites are implicated as biochemical intermediates in the production of the neutrophilia but not lymphopenia, since indomethacin and dexamethasone both completely abrogated IL-1-induced neutrophilia but did not affect the IL-1-induced lymphopenia. Acetylsalicylic acid, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, did not inhibit IL-1-induced neutrophilia, suggesting that products of the lipoxygenase rather than the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonate metabolism may contribute to the neutrophilia. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF) administered i.v. to Lewis rats induced peripheral neutropenia, two peaks of neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. A wide range of doses of rTNF resulted in an initial neutropenia at 0.5 hr after injection followed by a first peak of neutrophilia at 1.5 hr and a second peak of neutrophilia at 6 hr. The initial neutropenia and the first peak of neutrophilia were not inhibited by pretreatment of rats with dexamethasone, indomethacin, or aspirin. The second peak of neutrophilia was inhibited by both dexamethasone and indomethacin, but was not at all inhibited by aspirin, suggesting that the second peak of neutrophilia is mediated by the release of endogenous cytokines, especially by IL-1, since exogenous IL-1-induced neutrophilia is also completely inhibited by dexamethasone and indomethacin but not by aspirin. The TNF-induced peripheral neutrophilia is also accompanied by a significant depletion of bone marrow neutrophils, indicating that the source of increased circulating neutrophils is, at least in part, via recruitment of marrow neutrophils. Systemic blood pressure was not affected by IL-1 or rTNF at the dosages employed, showing that the changes in circulating leukocyte subsets were not attributable to hemodynamic changes nor to the hemodynamic change-related release of adrenal hormones. Adrenalectomy did not alter the IL-1- or rTNF-induced neutrophilia or lymphopenia, also demonstrating that neither monokine mediates its hematologic effects on peripheral blood leukocytes via the release of adrenal hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The presence of the lpr/lpr genotype on a number of murine genetic backgrounds results in a systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease and lymphadenopathy. The T lymphocytes of these mice exhibit a variety of abnormalities; most pertinent to the present report is an abnormally high level of c-myb proto-oncogene mRNA. Since the c-myb protein is presumably the effector molecule that affects cellular functions, it is important to determine whether increased levels of this c-myb protein are produced. With the use of immunoprecipitation with an anti-v-myb reagent, we found high levels of c-myb protein in the lymph nodes of lpr mice. Detailed analysis showed that the c-myb protein is primarily expressed by an abnormal T lymphocyte population that does not express the mature T cell markers, L3T4 and Lyt-2. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the c-myb proteins from normal thymocytes and from these L3T4-, Lyt-2-T cells are indistinguishable. DNA analysis with Southern hybridizations showed the lack of amplification, insertions, deletions, and rearrangements, which is in accord with results from the protein studies. Most interestingly, the c-myb gene in lpr L3T4-, Lyt-2- T cells is hypomethylated compared with normal controls. This suggests that a regulatory mechanism, rather than the structural alteration of the gene, is responsible for elevated expression of c-myb in these L3T4-, Lyt-2- cells.\r"

  ".W": "The status of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes was investigated in patients with idiopathic nonmalignant monoclonal IgG cryoglobulinemia (NCG). In NCG, monoclonal antibodies are synthesized at an accelerated rate by nonmalignant B lymphocytes. In order to determine whether this high production rate is related to a clonal B cell expansion, the rearrangement of the Ig genes was investigated by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of four NCG patients. In three of four (VI, BR, and CH) clonal expansion of B cells was detected using probes specific for the c kappa, JH, c gamma 4 genes (in accordance with detecting IgG kappa cryoproteins in these patients). BamHI digestion of DNA from VI and BR produced three rearranged fragments which cohybridized with JH and c mu probes. This finding suggested the presence of additional nonsecretory B cell clones and/or disruption of the gene segments spanned by and detected with the probes. In VI the idiotype of the IgG cryoglobulin was also detected in association with IgM in the supernatant of Epstein-Barr virus-stimulated B lymphocytes using a murine monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody. In addition, the possibility of aberrant gene rearrangements was supported by noting the alteration of the c-myc gene locus in genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes of VI and CH. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from peripheral blood B cells of VI and CH demonstrated aberrant transcripts of the c-myc gene, showing an active role of the altered c-myc locus. Detection of c-myc rearrangement in NCG patients clearly shows that this event may not be a final step in malignant B cell transformation; however, it may be related to the clonal expansion and high rate of cryoglobulin synthesis of nonmalignant B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "88060450\r", 
  ".W": "Accessory molecules present on the cell surface of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in their activation. Antigen-specific recognition by CTL is inhibited by antibodies against Lyt-2, L3T4, or LFA-1 molecules. Presently it is not known whether these molecules function by binding a ligand such as class I or class II on the target cell or by delivering a signal that down-regulates T cell activation. In the present study we utilized anti-T cell antibodies including anti-T3 and anti-T cell receptor (alpha/beta) as well as an anti-Ly-6.2C monoclonal antibody to activate CTL clones to kill irrelevant targets or secrete BLT esterase. The redirected lysis assay system utilizes the fact that heteroconjugates between anti-T3, and anti-T cell receptor, or anti-Ly-6.2C and anti-trinitrophenyl can trigger CTL lysis of trinitrophenyl-coupled targets that did not express antigen. In this system anti-Lyt-2 antibodies as well as anti-LFA-1 antibodies inhibited triggering via T cell receptor-related molecules but not via the anti-Ly-6.2C heteroconjugate. In addition, the anti-Lyt-2 was shown to inhibit conjugate formation in the heteroaggregate assay system suggesting that the anti-Lyt-2 antibodies acted early in inhibiting CTL activity. Similar results were observed in a system in which the CTL clones were triggered to secrete a BLT-esterase-like activity in the absence of target cells. Anti-T3 coated on plastic was shown to activate BLT-esterase secretion. This secretion was inhibited by anti-Lyt-2 and anti-LFA-1. Thus, it would appear that both the Lyt-2 molecule and the LFA-1 molecule act as signal-transducing elements involved in CTL activation. In particular, the Lyt-2 molecule appears to preferentially function in receptor-mediated T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of human and murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 or -B7 can be distinguished based on their ability to kill murine transfectants expressing these molecules. The clones which do not recognize murine transfectants exhibited greatly reduced conjugate formation with these cells, indicating that the inability to lyse these cells occurs in recognition and binding. No systematic differences in inhibitory titer between the two types of CTL clones were seen with anti-CD8 (Lyt-2), anti-LFA-1, or monoclonal antibodies against HLA class I molecules. However, blocking with anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies suggested that different CTL clones recognized spatially separate epitopes on HLA-A2 and -B7. In addition, a correlation between the inability to recognize murine transfectants and fine specificity was seen. Eight of nine clones which did not lyse murine transfectants also failed to recognize human cells expressing HLA-A2.2 or -A2.3. In contrast only 5 of 12 clones which lysed transfectants failed to recognize the variant molecules. Analogous data were obtained with human CTL clones raised against HLA-A2.1. These findings suggest that CTL clones that do not lyse murine cells expressing appropriate antigens recognize epitopes that have been altered or lost as a consequence of expression on the murine cell surface. It is suggested that the loss of HLA-associated epitopes on the murine cell surface may be due to differences between mouse and human cells in the processing or presentation of class I-associated peptides.\r"

T cell lines (TCL) derived from beef insulin stimulation were highly specific for epitopes on beef insulin, whereas pork insulin stimulation generated T cells that recognized determinants shared with beef insulin. Included among TCL reactive with pork insulin is one line (P2/9) that is autoreactive with human insulin. Antigen-presenting cells of known HLA type and monoclonal antibodies directed at class II major histocompatibility complex antigens were used to confirm the role of HLA-DR in restricting the response of insulin immune T cells. No preference or determinant selection within the donor's haplotypes was identified because either DR1 or DRw6 antigen-presenting cells could present the A loop of beef insulin. A TCL that recognized the A loop of beef insulin in association with DR1 was also alloreactive to HLA DR3, or a molecule closely linked to it, in the absence of insulin. A second T cell clone with insulin specificity and alloreactivity was also derived by allo stimulation of the donor's cells with DR3+ cells. When tested with a series of DR3+ stimulator cells, the alloreactivity was directed at diabetes-associated haplotypes. These data show that the T cell repertoire for insulin of a single diabetic donor encompasses that of multiple inbred animal strains and includes fine specificity for one to two amino acids, recognition of autologous insulin, and cross-reactivity with an allogeneic major histocompatibility complex antigen.\r"

Purified neutrophils were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and separated on Percoll density gradients into four fractions enriched for azurophilic granules, specific granules, plasma membrane, and cytosol, respectively. The glycoproteins in these fractions were labeled with 3H-borohydride reduction, extracted with Triton X-114, and immunoprecipitated with 60.3, an anti-Mo1 monoclonal antibody Mo1 was detected only in the specific granule and plasma membrane fractions and partitioned exclusively into the detergent-rich fraction consistent with Mo1 being an integral membrane protein. In addition, treatment of specific granule membranes with a high salt, high urea buffer to remove absorbed or peripheral proteins failed to dissociate Mo1. These data support the hypothesis that Mo1 is an integral membrane protein of plasma and specific granule membranes in human neutrophils.\r"

The pre-B cell lymphoma cell lines express equivalent high steady state levels of c-myb mRNA. In contrast, the B cell lymphoma and plasmacytoma cell lines express steady state c-myb mRNA at levels which are 0.005 to 0.1 times that of the pre-B cell lymphoma lines. These results correlate high levels of c-myb mRNA expression with the pre-B cell stage of development. Subclones of the 1881 pre-B cell lymphoma which express K light chain and are surface IgM-positive as well as two types of hybrid B lymphoid cell lines have been used to demonstrate that surface immunoglobulin expression is not sufficient to result in the down-regulation of c-myb mRNA levels or changes in the expression N-myc mRNA, lambda 5 mRNA, or the BP-1 surface antigen which are markers of the pre-B cell stage of development. Thus, changes in the expression of genes which are independent of immunoglobulin expression are associated with transition from the pre-B cell to the immature B cell stage of development.\r"

Immunization of specific responder inbred strains with liver homogenates from the opposite allotype leads to precipitating antibody and cell-mediated immunity against F. The antibodies produced are autoantibodies as they react equally well with self. We have identified a cDNA clone from rat liver that reacts with alloantisera to F. The fused polypeptide produced by the clone was shown to correspond to F by several experiments. First, alloantisera to F antigen reacted with the cloned fused polypeptide, but not control recombinant clones. Second, mice immunized with the fused polypeptide generate an antibody response that reacts specifically with the 43-kDa protein of mouse liver homogenates and with highly purified F antigen. Finally, both anti-F allosera and sera from mice immunized with the fused polypeptide react with the same 43-kDa liver protein on two-dimensional immunoblots. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the clone are presented and the sequence was found to have a significant homology with L28, an Escherichia coli ribosomal protein. The availability of recombinant F antigen will allow definitive questions to be addressed with respect to epitopes and specifically the identification of the T cell epitope which allows for autoimmune responses.\r"

We found that Meth A-Im-SPL suppressed Meth A growth in the chimera nude mice which were reconstituted with bone marrow cells of the H-2d haplotype (i.e., BALB/c, DBA/2 and B10.D2), but not in the chimeras which were reconstituted with bone marrow cells of the H-2a, H-2b, or H-2k haplotype (i.e., B10.A, B10, and B10.BR). These results suggested that H-2 restriction occurred between Meth A-Im-SPL and bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells in tumor neutralization. Furthermore, Meth A-Im-SPL did not suppress Meth 1 tumors (antigenically distinct from Meth A tumors) in the presence or absence of mitomycin C-treated Meth A in a Winn assay. These results suggested that there is tumor specificity in the \"effector phase\" as well as in the \"induction phase\". The phenotype of the effectors in the Meth A-Im-SPL was Thy-1.2+ and L3T4+, because Meth A-Im-SPL lost their antitumor activity with pretreatment with anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and complement or anti-L3T4 mAb and complement, but not with anti-Lyt-2.2 mAb and complement or complement alone. Positively purified L3T4+ T cells from Meth A-Im-SPL (Meth A-Im-L3T4), obtained by the panning method, suppressed the tumor growth in the chimera nude mice which were reconstituted with bone marrow cells of B10.KEA2 mice (that were I-A region-identical with Meth A-Im-L3T4 cells but not others in H-2) as well as B10.D2 cells (that were fully identical with Meth A-Im-L3T4 cells in H-2). We conclude that Meth A-Im-SPL (L3T4+) neutralized the tumors in collaboration with I-A region-identical host bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells, and the neutralization was not accompanied by the \"bystander effect.\"\r"

An inability to produce appropriate concentrations of these prostanoids may be a factor in the pathogenesis of the digital vasospasm experienced by patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). The effect of sera from normal subjects, patients with primary RP, and patients with RP in association with systemic sclerosis (SS) on the production of PGI2 and PGE2 by cultured human endothelial cells was investigated. All sera produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but both the 10% and 20% sera from patients with RP and SS produced a significantly greater inhibition than control sera. The mean production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha expressed in ng/10(4) cells was 2.278 (normal), 1.9311 (RP), and 2.1824 (SS) after incubation with 1% serum for 24 h. This decreased to 1.3647, 0.5927, and 0.4171, respectively following incubation with 20% sera for 24 h. This represented a 44% (normal), 76% (RP), and 83% (SS) inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production compared with serum free media. Similar results were obtained after 1 h incubation experiments. There was a nonsignificant decrease in mean PGE2 production following similar incubations with 1% and 20% sera for 24 h. These results suggest that factor(s) present in the sera of patients with RP may reduce the ability of endothelial cells to synthesize or release the vasodilator and antiaggregatory prostanoid PGI2.\r"

Clinically, 1 patient had herpes gestationnis, 14 typical bullous pemphigoid (BP), 3 epidermolysis acquisita (EBA), 3 cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), and 11 patients overlapping clinical diseases. These 11 patients shared clinical features of BP, EBA, or CP and a clinical diagnosis could not be done safely. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed diaminobenzidine deposits in 20 patients on the epidermal side of dermo-epidermal junction in the lamina lucida as in BP. In 5 patients, deposits located mostly under the anchoring fibril zone, in the floor of a sublamina densa dermoepidermal separation for 2 of them, were consistent with a diagnosis of EBA. In 6 patients, deposits were located mostly in the lamina densa, in the floor of a dermoepidermal separation occurring in the lamina lucida for 3 of them. This suggests that some of these 6 patients had neither EBA or BP, but another autoimmune bullous disease again, an uncharacterized component of dermoepidermal junction located in the lamina densa. Finally, a correlation exists between the sites of IgG and/or C3 components on epidermal or dermal side of dermoepidermal junction and the presence or absence of characteristic clinical features such as scar, milia formation, or mucosal involvement.\r"

We have examined the comparative efficiency of relatively purified populations of Langerhans cells and their epidermal companions, keratinocytes, to induce alloimmunity when injected intravenously into adult mice. It was found that as few as 100 BALB/c Langerhans cells injected intravenously into C3H mice are capable of inducing specific sensitization as evidenced by subsequent accelerated rejection of BALB/c skin grafts. By contrast, 10,000 BALB/c keratinocytes failed to immunize similarly injected C3H recipients. These results emphasize the unparalleled capacity of Langerhans cells to induce sensitization, and they point to Langerhans cells, among cells within the epidermal compartment, as dominant in the alloimmunogenic potential of skin grafts.\r"

Life-table analysis revealed quicker healing and significant reductions in the duration of shedding of virus in interferon-treated patients. Maximum daily geometric mean titers of virus and total area of unhealed lesions also decreased more quickly. No statistically significant difference in resolution of pain was seen between the two groups. Interferon had no effect on onset or frequency of subsequent recurrences recorded over one year of follow-up. Moderate, transient neutropenia occurred in 13 of 34 interferon-treated patients. A therapeutic effect of human leukocyte interferon on initial genital herpes was documented, but the clinical usefulness of interferon treatment of genital herpes is limited at this time.\r"

The beads were amassed on the filter surface after a 1-hr incubation in the CSF. Spherical particles with a diameter ranging between 150 and 500 nm were detected. Such particles bound specifically to latex beads covered by monoclonal antibodies to measles virus hemagglutinin but not to beads conjugated with monoclonal antibodies specific for nucleoprotein. Adding the two monoclonal antibodies to measles virus hemagglutinin to the CSF agglutinated the virus particles in a dose-dependent way. Further, no particles in the CSF bound to microspheres conjugated with monoclonal antibodies to non-related antigens of Sendai virus, cytomegalovirus, or human immunodeficiency virus. Similarly sized particles were also identified by transmission electron microscopy after concentrating the CSF.\r"

Basic principles of the 1977 guidelines remain valid; however, changes in the clinical application of anti-infective agents and in the accepted design of clinical trials have occurred. Some changes are inconsistent with the requirements of the 1977 documents. Members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have the perspective and knowledge needed to assist in updating the 1977 guidelines. It is proposed that the IDSA establish a formal working relationship with the FDA to review and modernize the 1977 guidelines. Industry participation in this process is desirable. If the IDSA can help orchestrate guideline revision in an environment of mutual respect and cooperation, the result may be a more efficient drug-evaluation process that continues to protect the public interest and is more consistent with contemporary concepts of treatment for infectious disease.\r"

We evaluated the feasibility of using electron microscopy and stereology to quantitate the effects of multiple culture conditions on the ultrastructure of type II alveolar cells, in vitro. The decrease in lamellar body volume density with time in culture was not affected by culturing the cells in the presence of insulin, fibronectin, or complex extracellular matrix. However, dexamethasone significantly prevented this decrease in lamellar body volume density. The mitochondrial volume density of the cells remained constant with time in culture under control conditions and in the presence of insulin, dexamethasone, or fibronectin. There was, however, a significant increase in mitochondrial volume density, for a short period of time (48 hours), when cells were cultured in the presence of complex extracellular matrix. These studies suggest that electron microscopy with stereology provides an excellent technique to quantitate in vitro ultrastructural changes in cultured type II alveolar cells.\r"

  ".U": "88061475\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy-three patients with regional, inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer received treatment with initial chemotherapy for two cycles (vinblastine-mitomycin followed in 3 weeks by vinblastine-cisplatin), with planned subsequent neutron irradiation to the primary site and concurrent, elective whole-brain irradiation using photons, followed by two more cycles of identical chemotherapy. Histology was reported as adenocarcinoma or large cell in 75%, and 60% had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) stage 3 disease; the remainder had stage 4. The response rate to chemotherapy induction was 51%. There were 58 patients in a second phase of the study who were potentially eligible for treatment with a medically dedicated cyclotron having more favorable characteristics with regard to treatment planning and dose delivery (neutrons \"B\"). The overall response rate in this group was 79%. Chemotherapy toxicity included four fatalities (5%), with three related to mitomycin C induced bilateral pneumonitis, and an additional five patients (7%) with life-threatening events that required hospitalization. Two fatalities were attributed to combined effects of chemotherapy and radiation, and six more to chest radiation therapy, for an overall treatment-related death incidence of 12 of 73 (16%). Four of the six deaths related to chest irradiation occurred after treatment with a \"physics-based\" neutron generator (neutrons \"A\"). Among the 45 who received neutrons in the B group, two (4%) had radiation-related deaths, and another four (10%) had clinically evident radiation pneumonitis. Pretreatment performance status (PS) and response to chemotherapy, but not RTOG stage or weight loss, were significantly associated with survival. Among patients who actually received chest irradiation, only initial response to chemotherapy remained as a significant predictor of survival in univariate analysis, with a median survival of 20 months in responders v 9 months in chemotherapy nonresponders. The patterns of first relapse observed in B group patients revealed that 28% were distant, while 64% were locoregional. This represents a reversal of the usual pattern in studies of chest irradiation alone. It probably reflects elimination of brain relapse by the use of elective whole-brain irradiation, impact of systemic chemotherapy on micrometastases elsewhere, and conservative treatment volumes employed for the chest irradiation in an attempt to minimize its toxicity. Further exploration of combined modality therapy is indicated for regional non-small-cell disease, with a real potential for survival impact if the therapeutic index can be improved.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of dose escalation in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), 298 patients with extensive-stage disease were treated with either conventional-dose cyclophosphamide (1,000 mg/m2), doxorubicin (40 mg/m2), and vincristine (1 mg/m2), (CDCAV); or high-dose cyclophosphamide (1,200 mg/m2), doxorubicin (70 mg/m2), and vincristine (1 mg/m2) (HDCAV). No dose attenuation was allowed during the initial three cycles of therapy in either treatment arm. All patients received CDCAV in cycles 4 through 6, during which time dosages were adjusted according to granulocyte and platelet nadirs. No additional chemotherapy was administered until disease progression or relapse was documented. Complete responses were more frequent with HDCAV (22% v 12%; P = .045). However, overall response rate (63% v 53%) and median survival (29.3 v 34.7 weeks) were not significantly different (P greater than .05). HDCAV was substantially more toxic than CDCAV, causing more episodes of life-threatening leukopenia (ie, granulocytes less than 500/microL; 79% v 40%; P less than .05) and infections (15% v 4%; P less than .05). Dose intensification of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin during induction chemotherapy did not produce any survival benefit compared with conventional dosages of these agents in SCLC patients with extensive-stage disease.\r"

  ".W": "A rationally devised induction regimen of vincristine, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and sequentially-escalated cyclophosphamide (CPM), followed by S-phase-specific agents (5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/cytosine arabinoside [ara-C]/hydroxyurea), was used in 100 patients with neuroblastoma. Of 17 patients under 1 year of age at diagnosis, complete (CR)/good partial (GPR) responses with long-term disease-free survival were achieved in 11 (85%) of 13 new patients and in two of four previously treated patients; six of the GPRs also received myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow rescue to consolidate remission status. The 83 patients over 1 year of age at diagnosis included three groups: (1) 36 new patients whose N4SE included maximal-dose CPM (ie, up to 140 to 160 mg/kg/course); (2) an earlier group of 18 new patients whose N4SE included moderate-dose CPM (ie, up to 80 mg/kg/course); and (3) 29 previously treated patients who all received the maximal-dose N4SE regimen. For new patients, CR/GPR rates were 72% in the maximal-dose group v 39% in the earlier moderate-dose group (P = .029). A CR/GPR rate of 41% and a partial response rate of 17% were observed for the 29 previously treated patients, all but two of whom had large tumor burdens after therapy that included moderate doses of CPM. Despite consolidation with myeloablative therapy, many responders in the three groups ultimately relapsed. The N4SE was strongly myelosuppressive, but only two patients died from associated infection. Extramedullary toxicity was limited to hemorrhagic cystitis in four of 33 CPM previously treated patients; this problem did not occur in the 67 new patients. The data indicate that the maximal-dose N4SE is an effective induction regimen for neuroblastoma, can achieve marked regressions of disease resistant to less intensive therapy, and is sparing of major body organs. This high rate of remission induction must be coupled with improvements in consolidation therapy to assure long-term disease-free survival of poor-risk patients.\r"

  ".U": "88061483\r", 
  ".W": "This prospective randomized trial, conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, is the largest study, so far, of adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer. The trial is unique in that it is nationwide and based on a nonselected population of patients, and is the only adjuvant trial studying the effect of cyclophosphamide monotherapy. After total mastectomy with axillary node sampling, followed by local radiotherapy, 1,032 pre- and perimenopausal women with operable breast cancer were randomized to observation alone, or to adjuvant chemotherapy for 1 year with either cyclophosphamide monotherapy or with a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). As of January 1987, median follow-up was 68 months. From early on both cyclophosphamide alone and CMF were found to improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) significantly and to a similar degree (P = .0001). However, an overall survival advantage did not become evident until 5 years after the start of treatment. So far, this advantage appears to be more pronounced in CMF (P = .0065) than in cyclophosphamide-only patients (P = .08). Thus, the study confirms the findings of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) and Milan trials that adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs the survival of premenopausal women with early breast cancer. A retrospective analysis revealed that, in contrast with CMF, cyclophosphamide alone did not improve RFS significantly in subsets of patients without amenorrhea, with estrogen-receptor (ER) negative tumors, and with tumors of low histological differentiation. Assuming that cyclophosphamide alone is a less tumoricidal treatment than CMF, these findings suggest that the effect of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is mediated partly through chemical castration, and partly through a purely cytotoxic effect.\r"

Eight patients are alive and well for +108 to +3,359 days post-transplantation. Nine patients died of transplant-related complications (six of interstitial pneumonia, two of gastrointestinal bleeding, and one of fungal sepsis) and three patients died with persisting or recurring disease.

  ".W": "A multicentric randomized prospective trial was conducted to test whether late intensification chemotherapy would increase the remission rate, the relapse-free survival, and the survival of small-cell lung cancer patients responding to induction chemotherapy. Autologous bone marrow transplantation was used as support to reduce the duration of the aplasia induced by very high-dose chemotherapy. As induction chemotherapy, 101 patients received, during a period of 5 months, a total dosage of 120 mg/m2 methotrexate, 4.5 mg/m2 vincristine, 1,800 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 180 mg/m2 doxorubicin, 160 mg/m2 cisplatin, 750 mg/m2 VP-16-213, and 30 Gy prophylactic cranial irradiation. Forty-five patients, selected for their sensitivity to this induction treatment, were randomized to a last cycle of chemotherapy that combined cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and VP-16-213 either at a conventional dosage of 750 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), 60 mg/m2 IV, and 600 mg/m2 orally or alternatively at a very high dosage of 6 g/m2 IV, 300 mg/m2 IV, and 500 mg/m2 IV, respectively. In the late intensification group, the complete remission rate increased from 39% before randomization to 79% after high-dose chemotherapy. Median relapse-free survivals after randomization for intensified and control chemotherapy groups were 28 and 10 weeks, respectively (P = .002). Median overall survival after induction therapy was 68 weeks for the intensified group compared with 55 weeks for the conventional therapy group (P = .13). Four patients died during intensification. Patients in both groups relapsed at the primary site. It can thus be concluded that late intensification chemotherapy for sensitive small-cell lung cancer increases the complete remission rate and resulted in a statistically significant increase in the relapse-free survival. However, since relapse occurred at the primary site and toxicity was high, overall survival was not significantly improved.\r"

From June 1984 through January 1985, 56 patients with limited-extent SCLC were enrolled in a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase II study using five cycles of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] day 1), etoposide (80 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 3), and cisplatin (33 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 3) administered at 3-week intervals (CEP), with radiation therapy (50 Gy to chest and 30 Gy to brain) administered concomitant with cycles 4 and 5, followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 IV day 1), etoposide (80 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 3), and doxorubicin (50 mg/m2 IV day 1). Of 49 patients evaluable for response, the overall response rate was 88%, with 57% CRs. The median overall survival was 14 months; the median duration of CR was 10 months, and nine CRs remain disease free at a median follow-up of 23 months. Toxicity was significant: 56% patients experienced WBC less than 1,000 microL, 32% platelets less than 25,000 microL and 10% hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL. There was one treatment-related septic death. These results are as good as the best previous CALGB study of SCLC, despite a reduction in duration of treatment from 18 to 5 months. We are currently using a variant of this multimodality treatment approach as our standard management for patients with limited-extent SCLC.\r"

PE consisted of cisplatin, 80 mg/m2, intravenously (IV) on day 1, and etoposide, 150 mg/m2, IV on days 3 through 5. IE consisted of ifosfamide, 1,500 mg/m2, IV on days 1 through 5, and etoposide, 120 mg/m2, IV on days 3 through 5. Six cycles were administered in 3-week intervals. Nonresponders were switched immediately to CAV, consisting of cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2, IV on days 1 and 2, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), 50 mg/m2, IV on day 1, and vincristine, 2 mg, IV on day 1. Patients obtaining complete remission (CR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation with 30 Gy. After completion of chemotherapy, patients with limited disease received chest irradiation with 45 Gy. No maintenance therapy was given to patients in CR. Minimum follow-up was 2 years. Of the 141 patients evaluable, the overall response rate was 65% in PE therapy and 68% in IE therapy. The CR rate was 32% v 20% for all patients, 50% v 24% for limited disease, and 22% v 18% for extensive disease, all in favor of PE therapy. Median survival for all patients was 11.6 months v 9.4 months, for limited disease 14.8 months v 11.0 months, and for extensive disease 8.9 months v 7.5 months, all preferring PE therapy. The 2-year survival rate was higher in PE therapy than in IE therapy for all patients (12% v 9%) and for limited disease (23% v 10%), but not for extensive disease (5% v 9%). Median progression-free survival was 7.5 months v 6.0 months for all patients, 12.2 months v 8.8 months for limited disease, and 5.9 months v 4.4 months for extensive disease, all in favor of PE. Relapse in the area of the primary tumor was found less often after PE than after IE therapy (25% v 38%). Response to second-line CAV was seen in 30% of patients with prior PE and 43% with prior IE therapy, but was usually short lasting, and only one patient achieved CR. Toxicity included three lethal complications. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin lesions occurred more often after PE than after IE therapy. These results suggest that PE is superior to IE chemotherapy in limited-stage, but not in extensive-stage SCLC, and that CAV is cross-resistant to PE, as well as to IE in the majority of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since current clinical trials assessing new agents occur in patients with advanced breast cancer having failed one and sometimes many polychemotherapy programs, these new agents may not be given a fair trial. In an effort to assess the possibility of using an alternative study design, we analyzed older clinical trials that used a controlled study design, randomizing between a single new drug and an established polychemotherapy program with a cross-over design upon failure. We were interested in noting that the pooled data did display a slight survival advantage (median 3.7 months) for the group receiving polychemotherapy as initial therapy. The survival distributions were clearly not significant using the log rank test, but did approach significance using the Smirnov. It is apparent that, while some slight advantage does occur for that group of patients receiving initial polychemotherapy, the magnitude of this effect is not great and is short in duration. Serious consideration should be given to the assessment of new agents as first-line therapy, particularly should they have a unique mode of action or lessened morbidities or toxicities.\r"

  ".W": "We have prospectively evaluated the performance of the implanted battery-powered Medtronic (Minneapolis) SynchroMed infusion system. Between July 1984 and July 1986, fifty-three SynchroMed pumps were implanted in 52 patients for phase I and II trials of low-dose continuous-infusion doxorubicin (N = 35) or vinblastine (N = 17). The median duration of pump function was 145 days (mean, 180; range, 20 to 787 +) and the systems infused drugs for 61% (range, 32% to 100%) of their patient implant time. During 10,045 patient days (27.5 years) of implantation, there have been no failures of the pump mechanism and pump accuracy was excellent (2.2% error rate in 256 analyzed refills). The median cost of the hospitalization for implantation was +17,140 in 14 analyzed cases. Complications requiring a second surgical procedure occurred with 13 systems (24%). Two of the complications were related to localized cutaneous hypersensitivity to vinblastine, four were directly related to system complications, and seven were secondary to implant procedure problems. Seven patients (13%) requested removal of the device after tumor progression occurred. Based on this experience, the company has made improvements in certain aspects of system design and has implemented a comprehensive user training program to minimize procedure-related problems. The Medtronic SynchroMed is an accurate and sophisticated system that allows infusion of low-dose doxorubicin and of vinblastine for prolonged periods. Extravasation of these vesicant agents must be carefully prevented. The financial cost of this implanted system may limit its use to patients with an expected survival of 5 months or longer.\r"

Thirty-one patients who were about to receive their first cycle of chemotherapy, using a combination regimen including cisplatin at a dose greater than or equal to 60 mg/m2 were randomized to receive an antiemetic regimen of either metoclopramide and dexamethasone alone, or these two drugs plus transdermal scopolamine patches. The mean number of episodes of emesis was .63 +/- 1.31 in the 16 scopolamine-treated patients, and 2.27 +/- 2.66 in the 15 patients who did not receive scopolamine (P less than .01). The scopolamine appeared to inhibit extrapyramidal reactions to the metoclopramide, but the number of cases was too small for statistical significance. We conclude that the addition of transdermal scopolamine to a standard metoclopramide and dexamethasone antiemetic regimen provides additive benefit in the control of cisplatin-induced emesis.\r"

Administration of HDMTX results in tumoricidal plasma concentrations of the drug without significant host toxicity, provided that plasma MTX levels are monitored and LV rescue is properly administered. The original premise of LV rescue was that the provision of reduced folate to normal cells would circumvent the metabolic block produced by MTX and allow resumption of DNA synthesis, although the presumed therapeutic selectivity of leucovorin has not yet been adequately explained. Despite a strong pharmacologic rationale and a vast clinical experience, HDMTX with leucovorin rescue has not been shown to be unequivocally superior to conventional doses of MTX in any clinical situation except, perhaps, for treatment of osteogenic sarcoma and childhood acute leukemia. While HDMTX is an important component of effective treatment regimens for these diseases, its precise contribution to the success of these regimens remains undefined. Although HDMTX can theoretically overcome all known mechanisms of MTX resistance, no data exist to suggest that this can be accomplished in the clinic. Thus, this well-known but poorly understood treatment regimen must remain a subject of clinical investigation rather than a part of routine clinical practice.\r"

The presence of hemorrhage was correlated with the neurological presentation. The highest hemorrhage rate (70.0%) was found in patients with prior neurological history who experienced apoplectic deterioration (acute-on-chronic presentation). Only 57.1% of patients with acute deterioration in the absence of prior neurological symptoms had hemorrhages. The highest hemorrhage rate for primary brain tumors was 29.2% for mixed oligodendroglioma/astrocytoma, while the highest hemorrhage rate for any tumor type was 50% for metastatic melanoma. The clinical relevance of tumor hemorrhage is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report survival data for the first 41 patients treated for recurrent malignant gliomas with interstitial brachytherapy at the University of California, San Francisco (1980-1984). Iodine-125 (125I) sources were temporarily implanted using stereotaxic techniques. The median survival period for 18 patients with recurrent glioblastomas was 52 weeks after brachytherapy; two patients are alive more than 5 years after brachytherapy. The median survival period for 23 patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas is 153 weeks after brachytherapy, with 10 patients alive more than 3 years and four patients alive more than 4 years after brachytherapy. Both groups did significantly better (p less than 0.01) than groups of patients with the same diagnoses and similar general characteristics who were treated at recurrence with chemotherapy alone. Because of deterioration of their clinical condition and evidence of recurrence from computerized tomographic scans, 17 (41%) of 41 patients required reoperation 20 to 72 weeks after brachytherapy. Despite the invariable presence of apparently viable tumor cells mixed with necrotic tissue in the resected specimen, nine patients have survived more than 2 years after reoperation and two of the nine are still alive 4 years after reoperation. The authors conclude that brachytherapy with temporarily implanted 125I sources for well-circumscribed, hemispheric, recurrent malignant gliomas is effective and offers a chance for long-term survival even though focal radiation necrosis can seriously degrade the quality of survival in a minority of patients.\r"

Twenty-two of the subjects allocated to the treatment group were unable to take supplementary calcium but agreed to remain in the study as additional controls. There were therefore 136 treated subjects, 52 strict controls and 74 controls altogether. During the initial observation period of 9 mo, there was a highly significant loss of bone in all groups (P less than 0.001). During the 9-mo period of treatment, there was a highly significant reduction in the rate of bone loss in the treated subjects (P less than 0.001), a just significant reduction in the strict controls (P less than 0.05) and a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of loss in all controls. The difference between the treated and strict controls in the second period was not significant but the difference between the treated and all controls in the second period was significant (P less than 0.025). When the analysis was applied only to women within 10 yr of menopause, the difference between the treated and strict control groups in period 2 was significant (P less than 0.025) and the difference between the treated and all controls was highly significant (P less than 0.001).\r"

This and other observations led to the deduction that insulin is required for the synthesis of acetyl CoA carboxylase even though the actual amount of enzyme was not measured. We have developed methods to determine the quantity of acetyl CoA carboxylase in crude tissue extracts with which we have reexamined the role of insulin in regulating the amount of the enzyme in liver of acute (3-d) alloxan diabetic rats. The results show that although there was a decrease in the quantity of the active cytoplasmic form of acetyl CoA carboxylase in the liver of alloxan diabetic rats, there was a corresponding increase in the quantity of relatively inactive forms of the enzyme associated with mitochondria. Thus, the total amount of enzyme was minimally affected by the diabetic state. Instead, the results indicate that decreased acetyl CoA carboxylase activity in liver of the diabetic rats was attributable to a shift in the subcellular distribution of the enzyme from the active cytoplasmic to inactive mitochondrial forms. We have shown previously that subcellular distribution of the enzyme is dietary dependent. Results of this study implicate insulin in the mobilization and activation of mitochondrial acetyl CoA carboxylase.\r"

Intravenous antibiotics are not essential in the management of all acute respiratory exacerbations of mild to moderate severity in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Patients treated with either netilmicin or ceftazidime had between five and eight samples drawn for drug concentration measurement after the first or the last dose of the drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using all the available points as a reference and then recalculated with 2, 3, or 4 points. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution were significantly different from the reference value when 2 points were used for netilmicin after the first dose and ceftazidime after the last dose. Had parameters obtained from 2 points been used, mean dosage would have been underestimated by 15% for ceftazidime and 11% for netilmicin, and some patients would have received only 65% of the dose calculated from all available points. When 3 points were used, dosage would have been underestimated by a mean of only 1% for ceftazidime and 5% for netilmicin when compared with the dosage estimated from the reference parameters. We conclude that 3 concentration time points may be all that are required for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters sufficiently accurate for practical purposes in neonates.\r"

However, the dilemma of whether Th or Tc cells actually mediate allograft rejection remains. Although belonging to opposite immunologic \"teams,\" they act on each other in many ways, interactions that are probably just the beginning of the complex cascade of both specific and nonspecific host immunologic events, both cell mediated and humoral, that are stimulated by the presence of allogeneic tissues.\r"

Strategies to prevent rejection are based on cyclosporine, and aim to achieve improved graft survival while decreasing the incidence of nephrotoxicity, and include the use of low doses of cyclosporine, cyclosporine conversion protocols, triple therapy (with low doses of azathioprine, cyclosporine, and steroids), and delayed administration of cyclosporine. There is no agreement as to the most satisfactory protocol at this time, but the use of cyclosporine has allowed the use of low doses of steroids or even discontinuation of steroid therapy, a major advance in pediatric transplantation. The treatment of rejection still depends on the use of high doses of steroids, but heterologous anti-lymphocyte globulin and OKT3, a pan-T monoclonal antibody, can be used with success in steroid-resistant rejection episodes. Other monoclonal antibodies directed at leukocyte subpopulations are likely to be of value in time as our understanding of the mechanisms of rejection of renal allograft increases.\r"

The incidence of allograft loss and treated rejection episodes was much greater in pediatric than in adult recipients, and the evidences of nephrotoxicity lessened. Although resistance of the child's immune system to the effects of the drug cannot be excluded, it appears more likely that this relates to the rapid clearance of the agent in the pediatric age group (39.6 mL/min/kg) versus in adults (12.3 mL/min/kg), thereby reducing the area under the serum concentration curve from 765 +/- 593 to 386 +/- 277 ng/mL/hr per mg/kg (mean +/- SD). This effect caused trough serum levels measured by radioimmunoassay to be below the putative threshold. These findings demonstrate the need for higher cyclosporine doses and frequency in pediatric compared with adult patients.\r"

After a mean follow-up of 17.3 months, the patient and graft survival is 100% (18 of 18) for mismatched related kidneys, and 90% (nine of 10) for cadaver kidneys. The single graft failure was the result of a death from technical complications. Serum creatinine concentration after transplantation ranged from 0.3 to 1.7 mg/dL (mean 0.85 mg/dL). The probability of a rejection episode in the first year was 45% and 60% for mismatched-related and cadaver kidneys, respectively. Cyclosporine nephrotoxicity was recognized in only one (3.7%) of 27 children, and was rapidly reversed after cyclosporine was discontinued. An initial group of nine children was weaned from cyclosporine therapy 6 to 12 months after transplantation, but two (22%) had rejection episodes. Our preliminary experience suggests that the use of a quadruple immunosuppressive regimen for both living related and cadaver renal transplants in children is associated with an improved graft function rate and a low incidence of complications.\r"

  ".U": "88061895\r", 
  ".W": "Two important criteria for successful end-stage renal disease therapy in children are achievement of optimal growth and possession of a well-functioning renal transplant. We describe eight children with accelerated post-transplant growth. Accelerated and even catch-up growth was achievable if the transplant occurred at an early age (less than 9 years), the daily dose of prednisone was low (less than or equal to 0.24 mg/kg/d), and renal function was excellent (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2). However, the benefit to growth of transplanting a kidney in young children may be offset by reduced cadaver graft survival in children younger than 6 years. To study whether the less favorable graft survival was attributable to an increased immunologic responsiveness in the younger child, we examined three tests of nonspecific immune responsiveness, each of which, when increased, may indicate a propensity toward rejection: total T cell absolute number, T helper/suppressor ratio, and spontaneous blastogenesis. Each measurement was significantly increased in 20 uremic children 5 years old or younger, compared with 81 children 6 to 23 years of age. These data suggest that improved growth may be attained by transplanting a kidney in the young child with end-stage renal disease, but the young child may be at increased risk for rejection. This hypothesis suggests that for optimal rehabilitation, strategies should take into account the unique needs of the young child.\r"

The patients were followed up for 2 to 4 years, but no differences in the survival rates of patients or their transplants were seen. The survival of first cadaver grafts after 1 year was 73% and 76% in groups receiving cyclosporine alone and cyclosporine plus steroids, respectively. Although the patients treated with cyclosporine alone were more susceptible to nephrotoxic effects, the group receiving steroids were significantly more at risk of developing a cushingoid appearance and had an increased incidence of serious infections. After this trial, an additional 45 patients received only cyclosporine, 8 to 10 mg/kg/d, after renal transplantation. Nephrotoxic effects were much less common, and the actuarial survival rate for first cadaver grafts was 83% at 1 year. It is our view that combinations of immunosuppressive agents for kidney transplantation are both unnecessary and possibly harmful and that excellent patient and graft survival rates may be obtained with cyclosporine alone.\r"

By virtue of its potency and selectivity, there has been a marked reduction in steroid requirement with a concomitant reduction in morbidity and mortality. The undesirable effect of cyclosporine on the kidney may thus be considered within this context. The short-term functional effect observed to some degree in most patients receiving this drug is rapidly reversible, and is unaccompanied by long-term detriment in studies now extending over 6 years. Progressive deterioration still occurs in a small proportion of patients, but may often be reversed by carefully controlled conversion to alternative combination immunosuppression therapy. For each developing application, the ultimate value of cyclosporine must be determined individually in relation to the severity of the disease process. The challenge that now confronts us is to determine the manner in which this agent may be most safely and effectively used.\r"

One child received a heterotopic transplant because of extremely high pulmonary vascular resistance. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of 4 to 40 mg/kg/d cyclosporine and 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone. Rejection was detected by the presence of myocyte necrosis in surveillance endomyocardial biopsy specimens. There were one intraoperative and three early deaths, two from infection and one rejection.

The most common indications for transplantation in decreasing order of frequency were biliary atresia, inborn errors of metabolism, and postnecrotic cirrhosis. The 5-year actuarial survival for the entire group was 69.2%. Age and diagnosis did not influence survival. Infections were the most common cause of death, followed by liver failure and cerebrovascular accident. The impact of retransplantation on survival depends on the indication. The survival is better when retransplantation is carried out after rejection than because of technical complications, and the latter has a better survival than does primary graft nonfunction. The difference in survival among these groups is statistically significant. The quality of life for 164 of 173 survivors is good to excellent; only nine children are currently experiencing medical problems. A persistent problem in pediatric transplantation is the scarcity of small donors.\r"

The rationale for its use originated from studies of patients with Hodgkin disease, in whom this radiotherapy regimen was noted to induce profound and long-lasting immune suppression and yet was well tolerated, with few long-term side effects. Total lymphoid irradiation is a unique immunosuppressive regimen that produces a selective (and long-lasting) reduction in the number and function of helper T cells and certain subsets of B cells. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs show little selectivity, and their effects are short-lived. The most important aspect of total lymphoid irradiation is the potential for achieving transplantation tolerance and permanent remissions in autoimmune disease in laboratory animals. Attempts are being made to achieve similar goals in humans given total lymphoid irradiation, so that immunosuppressive drugs can be ultimately withdrawn from transplant recipients and patients with lupus nephritis.\r"

  ".W": "Using a model in which seizure activity was elicited electrically from the inferior colliculus, the influence of both inhibitory and excitatory putative neurotransmitter amino acids on this seizure activity was assessed by manipulating neurotransmitter amino acid function. It was found that i.c.v. administration of the inhibitory amino acids taurine (2.5 micrograms) or glycine (30 micrograms), or the gamma-aminobutyric acidA agonist, muscimol (300 ng), significantly elevated the threshold current necessary to initiate seizure activity from the inferior collicular cortex. Similarly, the microinjection of muscimol (10 or 30 ng) or racemic baclofen (20 or 60 ng), a gamma-aminobutyric acidB agonist, into the inferior collicular cortex significantly elevated the seizure threshold current, but inferior collicular microinjections of taurine (1 microgram) or glycine (1 microgram) exerted no effect on the seizure threshold current. When excitatory amino acid influences were assessed on seizure production, neither ventricular administration of glutamate or aspartate (100 micrograms) nor inferior collicular administration of glutamate (1 or 10 micrograms) or aspartate (10 micrograms) changed the seizure initiation threshold. Although the site administration of 30 or 100 ng of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid did not alter the seizure initiation threshold, 300 ng of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid significantly lowered the amount of electrical stimulation necessary to elicit the seizure activity. Conversely, blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in the inferior colliculus with L-3-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (100 ng) or gamma-glutamylglycine (200 ng) significantly elevated the threshold current for seizure production, whereas microinjection of DL-3-amino-phosphonobutyric acid (200 ng) or glutamic acid diethyl ester (1 microgram) had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Surprisingly kelatorphan, which inhibits not only enkephalinase but also aminopeptidase and dipeptidylaminopeptidase activities, was less potent than thiorphan or phosphoramidon to enhance SPLI overflow. However, in the presence of ICI-154129 or naloxone to block opiate receptors, kelatorphan was as potent as thiorphan, therefore suggesting some negative influence of endogenous opioids on SPLI release with kelatorphan but not thiorphan. In agreement with this interpretation, the direct stimulation of delta opiate receptors by deltakephalin was found to significantly reduce SPLI overflow. Furthermore, an increased outflow of [Met]enkephalin-like material was observed from substantia nigra slices superfused with kelatorphan but not thiorphan. These results indicate that endogenous substance P released within the substantia nigra is very probably inactivated by enkephalinase and calpain, but not ACE. They also demonstrate that endogenous opioids can exert a negative control upon substance P release in this brain region.\r"

  ".W": "In each of two components of a multiple schedule, patas monkeys were required to respond on a right or left lever depending upon the stimulus combination (a color and a geometric form) presented. Reinforcement of a response in the presence of one stimulus (the form) was conditional upon the other stimulus (the color). The completion of a two-member chain of discriminations produced a food pellet. Errors produced a brief timeout. One component of the multiple schedule was a repeated-acquisition task in which the discriminative stimuli for left- and right-lever responses changed each session (learning). In the other component, the discriminative stimuli were the same each session (performance). Dose-effect curves were determined for the kappa agonists bremazocine, tifluadom, ethylketocyclazocine and U50488H. Each drug produced dose-related decreases in overall response rate but had little or no effect on accuracy in either learning or performance. The rate-decreasing effects of ethylketocyclazocine and tifluadom were due to a dose-related pause at the start of the session, whereas those of bremazocine and U50488 were due largely to sporadic pausing throughout the session. Naltrexone blocked the effects of each drug whereas quaternary naltrexone had no effect. In contrast to the kappa agonists, dexoxadrol produced a dose-related disruption in accuracy of responding in learning. Dexoxadrol also decreased response rate in both acquisition and performance in a dose-related manner. Naltrexone attenuated the effects of low doses of dexoxadrol on accuracy, but failed to block the disruptive effects of higher doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of several glutamate receptor antagonists to reduce hypoxic cortical neuronal injury was quantitatively examined in cell cultures derived from fetal mice. Cultures exposed to hypoxia for 8 hr showed by the following day widespread neuronal injury, which was substantially attenuated by addition of the specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). The protective effect of APV was concentration dependent (ED50 about 2 microM) and stereospecific (D-APV approximately 100 times more potent that L-APV). Neuron-protective effects were also observed with several other NMDA antagonists: 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, phencyclidine and (+)-SKF 10,047 [(+)-N-allylnormetazocine]--as well as with the nonspecific glutamate antagonists D-glutamylglycine and kynurenate. In addition, a similar antagonist profile was observed with a chemical model of hypoxic neuronal injury, produced by brief exposure to high concentrations of cyanide. In contrast, 1 mM concentrations of glutamate diethylester and gamma-aminomethyl sulfonate, compounds reported in some studies to preferentially antagonize non-NMDA glutamate receptors, failed to protect neurons against either hypoxia or cyanide. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA receptors are preferentially involved in the pathogenesis of hypoxic cortical neuronal injury and suggest that cortical cell culture may be a useful system in which to quantitatively characterize the pharmacology of that injury.\r"

The needle-through-the-noose technique involves making a knot by passing the needle of a suture through a noose loop formed near the distal end of the suture. This technique prevents inadvertant slippage of the suture's free short end through tissues, replaces the difficult first throw with simple passage of a needle through a noose and equalizes the amount of tension applied on the suture as it slides smoothly within the noose. The needle-through-the-noose knot can stand alone with continuous sutures but requires one more tie in interrupted sutures. The clock loop technique is based on turning the suture clockwise and counterclockwise for making square knots with instruments.\r"

A multiple-choice test was used to assess the students' knowledge after instruction, and the students completed a 14-item questionnaire concerning their opinions of CAI. No statistically significant difference was found between the test scores of the students using CAI and those in the tutorials for oncology; but in hematology the students in the tutorials had higher scores than those using CAI. The study design does not permit a definite explanation of the disparity in outcome for the two topics, but it is possible that the effectiveness of the presentations in the two sections was different. There was no statistically significant correlation between the time spent in the teaching setting and the score attained. The students did not consider CAI more effective than the tutorials but rather seemed to view it as a supplement to traditional teaching by lectures, textbooks, and studying from notes.\r"

The effects on survival of combining FN with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or antithrombin-III (AT-III) were also determined during S. typhimurium peritonitis and E. coli endotoxemia. Permanent survival was increased 15% in the peritonitis group (p less than 0.05) and 15% in the endotoxemic group (p greater than 0.05). There was no enhancement in survival by combining FN with a subprotective dose of IgG preparation. AT-III alone increased survival by 50% over survival in the control group. Combining FN with AT-III increased survival 10% greater than with AT-III alone, which is suggestive of an additive effect. Results from this study suggest that FN provides modest protection during Gram-negative peritonitis or endotoxemia in the rat. Combining FN with AT-III may augment in an additive manner the marked increase in survival observed with AT-III alone in this and previous studies.\r"

We analyzed the results of repeat cadaver kidney grafting with cyclosporine A immunosuppression. A total of 33 cyclosporine A-treated patients received the second kidney transplant at varying intervals after failure of the first transplant. Graft survival at 1 year was 66 per cent. A concurrent group of 189 cyclosporine A-treated first cadaver kidney recipients had a 1-year graft survival rate of 75 per cent, although this better result was not statistically significant (p greater than or equal to 0.25). A historical group of 31 azathioprine-treated second graft recipients had a significantly worse 1-year graft survival rate of 45 per cent compared to the cyclosporine A second graft group (p less than 0.1). Patient age, sex, early first graft loss, interval between transplants and the presence of panel reactive antibodies were not factors in predicting second graft outcome. A complete DR mismatch appeared to worsen the second transplant survival. These findings indicate that early graft survival of cyclosporine A-treated repeat cadaveric transplants is acceptable and is better than azathioprine-treated first or second grafts.\r"

After a median followup of 5 years (range 42 to 90 months) 40 of 120 evaluable patients (33.3 per cent) experienced relapse after a median interval free of disease of 17 months (range 2 to 74 months). Relapses occurred in 19 of 58 evaluable patients in the adjuvant treatment group (32.7 per cent) and in 21 of the 62 evaluable controls (33.9 per cent). Sex steroid hormone receptors were studied in 102 of the 120 evaluable patients with the dextran-coated charcoal technique. No significant correlation could be found among receptors, relapses and treatment. On the other hand, 33 (56.9 per cent) of the 58 treated patients experienced 39 complications related to the long-term hormonal therapy. Three patients had to discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate for severe toxicity after 2 to 3 months. Medroxyprogesterone acetate cannot be recommended as adjuvant therapy to radical nephrectomy in patients with renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Two surveys to determine the number of persons who were actually affected yielded estimates of 168 791 and 197 581 persons, making this the largest outbreak of salmonellosis ever identified in the United States. The epidemic strain was easily identified because it had a rare antimicrobial resistance pattern and a highly unusual plasmid profile; study of stored isolates showed it had caused clusters of salmonellosis during the previous ten months that may have been related to the same plant, suggesting that the strain had persisted in the plant and repeatedly contaminated milk after pasteurization.\r"

The reduction in the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particles occurs as a result of decreased synthesis and enhanced removal of LDLs by the LDL receptor pathway in hepatocytes. Moreover, the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which are inversely related to atherosclerosis, increase in concentration with treatment by these drugs. If the short-term safety of these drugs extends to ongoing long-term studies and if cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are affected by their use, this class of hypolipidemic agent will markedly facilitate the effective treatment of hypercholesterolemia.\r"

Although increased availability and use of abortion have resulted in fewer single women continuing their pregnancies, the increased tendency of unmarried mothers to raise rather than relinquish their children has, in particular, limited the number of babies available for adoption. Despite the unpopularity of adoption among women with unintended pregnancies, addressing this option remains an important part of pregnancy counseling. Appropriate obstetric care of women placing their babies for adoption includes acknowledgment of the loss these women experience. Knowledge of adoption resources and willingness to discuss adoption can help physicians provide better care of unintentionally pregnant as well as infertile patients.\r"

A 1950s-style, small-scale, voluntary activity has evolved, in 1987, into broad-scale programs with accredited sponsors and with ties to relicensure. Within the next three decades, CME will be directed by methods chosen by specialty boards for recertification and by exploitation of computer and telecommunication technology. Written recertification examinations can waste physicians' time studying material that will not improve care of their patients. We hope improved methods of analysis of individual practices, on-the-spot access to pertinent medical information, and better communication among physicians can be incorporated into recertification procedures. Policies established now will shape CME for decades to come. We encourage a coordinated effort by medical specialty boards, medical societies, hospitals, medical schools, computer corporations, telecommunication firms, granting agencies, and the National Library of Medicine to ensure the most effective and efficient recertification and CME policies.\r"

  ".U": "88063769\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to define the relationship between tumor burden (cachexia) and host hepatocyte gluconeogenesis, the following experiments were performed with the use of an F344 male rat bearing a transplantable sarcoma. Food intake of tumor-bearing (TB) rats was constant until day 24 following implant and a tumor burden of 18 +/- 5.2% (mean +/- SD), at which time food intake progressively declined daily. Tumor burden was arbitrarily divided at 12.8% to determine if any measured changes occurred prior to or following the approximate time when a significant decline in food intake occurred. Plasma glucose levels decreased with tumor burden. Whole-blood lactate levels increased with tumor burden. Fasting plasma alanine levels decreased with tumor burden. Plasma 3-methylhistidine levels increased with tumor burden. Plasma glucagon levels increased with tumor burden, whereas plasma insulin levels decreased. Hormone changes were noted at small tumor burdens prior to a decline in food intake. Viable hepatocytes were isolated from 4 groups: non-tumor-bearing (NTB), small tumor burden [(STB) 3.5% total body weight (TBW)], moderate tumor burden [(MTB) 14% TBW], and large tumor burden [(LTB) 23% TBW]. As expected in NTB rats, hepatocytes produced significantly more glucose with 20 mM lactate than 20 mM alanine or than Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) alone. Hepatocytes from STB rats demonstrated the same basic relationship for lactate, alanine, and HBSS, but they produced significantly more glucose from lactate and HBSS alone than NTB hepatocytes. With alanine as substrate, the rates of glucose production by hepatocytes were not affected by the presence or size of tumor. However, with lactate as substrate, hepatocytes from MTB and LTB rats produced progressively less glucose as tumor burden increased (r = -0.85, p less than .001), which may partly explain the reduction in blood glucose and elevation in blood lactate levels observed. Elevated gluconeogenesis in TB rats occurred early prior to a decline in food intake. The key precursor appeared to be lactate. The balance between glucagon and insulin appeared to promote the abnormal host carbohydrate metabolism observed.\r"

When screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on intact and disrupted BPV-1, -2, and deer papillomavirus, three patterns of reactivity were defined: reactivity only with intact virus, with both intact and disrupted virus, and only with disrupted virus. On the basis of ELISA results, the topographical location and requirement for conformation for immunoreactivity of epitopes was defined as external conformational, external linear, and internal linear. Cross-reactivity of MAbs with other papillomavirus types was analyzed by immunofluorescence on warts from different species. Type-specific, BPV-1 and/or -2 cross-reactive, broadly cross-reactive, and genus-specific MAbs were identified. MAb reactivity with structural polypeptides of BPV-1 was analyzed by Western blot. MAbs reactive with epitopes defined as conformational by ELISA did not react in Western blot. All MAbs reactive in Western blot reacted with the major capsid protein (MCP) [55 kilodalton (kDa)], demonstrating that the MCP carries both type-specific and cross-reactive epitopes. Most MAbs reactive with the MCP were cross-reactive with structural polypeptides of 48 and 96 kDa, demonstrating the immunologic relatedness of these three polypeptides.\r"

Twenty-three of the 28 patients died of GVHD. The incidence of transfusion-related GVHD in this patient population is low but the illness is often fatal as treatment is largely ineffective.

As a result of mass screening with the radioactive cell binding assay for the production of anti-gastric cancer related antibodies, one culture (TGc-106) among 1,400 microcultures was identified to secrete human antibody specifically reactive with an established human gastric cancer cell line as target (MKN-45). Furthermore, it was demonstrated with the autologous assay system by the histoimmunofluorescence method that cell surface antigens of autologous gastric cancer cells could be clearly defined with human antibody from one culture (TEb-079) out of 470 microcultures established from a gastric cancer patient (GCP-26); there was no reactivity against the surrounding normal cells constructing the gastric wall. The immunoglobulin class of the human antibodies produced both in TGc-106 and TEb-079 was determined from immunodiffusion tests to be IgM.\r"

An initial 8-week double-blind phase of the study with dosages of 0, 25, or 50 mg/day was followed by an open phase in which variable dosages of 25, 50, or 75 mg/day were used to achieve an optimal clinical response. All patients completed a minimum of 6 months of therapy. A good or an excellent response (at least 50% clearing) after 8 months of treatment was noted in six of the eight patients. One patient had a poor response (less than 50% clearing), and one patient continued to have worsening of psoriatic involvement during treatment. The best response occurred in those patients with the most extensive initial plaque involvement or palmoplantar pustulosis. The clinical side effects were similar to those reported with use of etretinate and seemed to be related to the dose. The laboratory abnormalities--primarily mild intermittent elevations of liver enzymes and elevations in serum lipids--were similar to those described in previous reports about etretinate. Both etretin and etretinate are potent teratogens. Because of its shorter half-life, etretin will likely be preferred, especially in female patients of childbearing potential.\r"

Protective efficacy was 60% calculated from the day of vaccination and 64% from 6 weeks after vaccination. Surveillance also included 11,691 unvaccinated children; 173 cases occurred in this group. Protective efficacy in relation to the unvaccinated group was 77.4% and 81.0% after 21 months, calculated immediately and 6 weeks after vaccination, respectively. Vaccination was associated with minimum local side-effects, and an increase in anti-Vi antibodies occurred, as measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody levels remained significantly raised at 6 and 12 months post vaccination. Vi CPS is thus a safe and effective means of typhoid vaccination.\r"

Before transplantation neuropathy was most advanced in the two diabetic groups. Both diabetic groups showed a similar slight but significant improvement of nerve conduction after transplantation. In the non-diabetic group nerve conduction became essentially normal. No group showed improvement in autonomic dysfunction. The improvement in nerve conduction after combined kidney and pancreas transplantation was most probably due to the elimination of uraemia. Furthermore, 2 years of normoglycaemia did not reverse the diabetic neuropathy to an important extent at this late stage of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Of 113 patients in whom endoscopy revealed a bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer 55 were randomly allocated to receive endoscopic sclerosis (ES) (injections of adrenaline/polidocanol) plus cimetidine while 58 received cimetidine alone as controls. 3 patients treated with ES (5.5%) compared with 25 controls (43.1%) had a major recurrent haemorrhage during their hospital stay. ES also led to significant reductions in the need for emergency surgery (3 vs 20 patients), transfusion requirements (mean 0.42 [SD 1.1] vs 2.7 (3.19) U), and the length of hospital stay (11.6 [5.1] vs 16.2 [11.3] days). ES as an adjunct to conventional medical treatment is an effective and safe emergency therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal breathing activity was monitored by ultrasonography in 14 patients with oligohydramnios (4 with fetal anuria and 10 with premature rupture of the membranes). 45 patients with intact membranes, with normal amniotic fluid volume, and matched for gestational age were the controls. Fetal breathing movements were seen in all 8 patients who died in the perinatal period with a necropsy diagnosis of lung hypoplasia. While patients with premature rupture of the membranes (irrespective of outcome) spent the same or less time breathing than controls, fetuses with renal anomalies, oligohydramnios, and lung hypoplasia spent more time breathing than controls. The observation of fetal breathing activity is not helpful in identifying patients with oligohydramnios at risk of lung hypoplasia.\r"
