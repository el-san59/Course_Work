  ".W": "The recurrent inhibition of the soleus alpha-motoneurons at rest, evaluated by a specially designed method of paired H reflexes, was estimated in 10 patients with spastic paraparesis. In three of these patients, Renshaw cell activity produced inhibition of the corresponding alpha-motor neurons comparable to that obtained in normal subjects, while the inhibition was reduced in five and absent in two. The effects of intravenously administered L-acetylcarnitine on the activity of Renshaw cells were studied in these patients. In all patients except the two with no evidence of recurrent inhibition, L-acetylcarnitine was found to significantly increase the amount of recurrent inhibition. Its effect became evident at about 30 minutes, reached a maximum around 50 minutes and vanished about 70 minutes from the onset of administration. A significant correlation was found between Renshaw cell activity and the ability of the drug to increase it. L-acetylcarnitine appeared to act specifically by enhancing recurrent inhibition, since no variation in the excitability of the monosynaptic reflex arc was observed.\r"

Electrical activity was determined by measuring amplitude and area of the potential, using the macro electromyography (EMG) technique. The mechanical response was characterised by contraction time, twitch force and relaxation time, recorded with the spike triggered averaging technique. With increasing tension of the whole muscle corresponding to an increasing threshold, the force of single units enlarged exponentially compared to their EMG. There was only a weak relationship between contraction time and electrical activity and none between EMG and relaxation time.\r"

Writing kanji was severely impaired without disturbed consciousness, aphasia or apraxia. On the other hand, writing kana (the Japanese syllabograms), and reading kanji and kana were almost intact. This suggests that the process of writing kanji involves a different pathway from that of reading kanji in the left temporal lobe. Pure agraphia of kanji is considered to be similar to lexical agraphia in Indo-European languages, in that the writing system with a poor or irregular phoneme-grapheme transformation is impaired by the left temporal lesion. This case indicates the necessity for considering thrombosis of the Labbe vein when a subcortical haematoma is detected in a temporal lobe on computed tomography of the brain.\r"

Serial neuro-psychological testing documented a rapid recovery of recognition, but delayed recovery in reproduction of learned information. Recovery of spontaneous verbal and figural fluency was even further delayed. Follow up SPECT examination showed a recovered cerebral perfusion. This case supports the hypothesis that TGA is associated with transient hypoperfusion of bilateral medial-temporal brain structures and suggests an additional involvement of structures responsible for drive and initiation.\r"

Thirty six brain dead patients were submitted to ABR and 24 to SEP in the same session. All waves of the ABR were absent in 28 (77.8 per cent) patients, while only wave I was present in the others (22.2 per cent). In SEP recordings the components later than P13 were absent in 17 (70.8 per cent) of cases; in the remaining seven patients (29.2 per cent) a N13/P13 dissociation (namely, retention of the cervical N13 and absence of the far-field P13) was found. The results suggest that SEP and ABR are reliable tools in the diagnosis of brain death and should be included in the criteria: they enable the functional status of two pathways in the brainstem to be checked, which cannot be explored by the clinical examination.\r"

In bronchiectatic lung regions, deposition of inhaled aerosol was diminished or inhomogeneous. Transport of inhaled radioactivity from the bronchiectatic regions was deranged in 95% of the patients (19/20). The following abnormal mucous transport patterns were regionally observed; stasis in 12 of the 20 patients (12/20), regurgitation or reversed transport in 14/20, straying in 8/20, spiral or zigzag transport in 1/20, and/or various combinations of these four abnormal transport patterns. When coughs occurred, regurgitation and stray became more marked in the bronchiectatic regions.

Magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained in seven patients.

Five of 16 sites (31%) had false-positive 111In-WBC uptake at noninfected sites. There were four true-positive and three false-positive MR studies. All false-positives showed at least moderately abnormal findings by both techniques at sites of rapidly progressing osteoarthropathy of recent onset. In this preliminary study, both techniques appear to be sensitive for detection of osteomyelitis, and a negative study makes osteomyelitis unlikely. However, the findings of 111In-WBC/99mTc-MDP and MR images at sites of rapidly progressing, noninfected neuropathic osteoarthropathy may be indistinguishable from those of osteomyelitis.\r"

In 13 normal subjects, the baseline left ventricular PV ratio was 3.5 and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 70%, both greater than the patients with infarction. In the patients after blockade, the systolic blood pressure decreased (p = 0.02), and the left ventricular end-systolic volume increased (p = 0.003), thus decreasing the P/V ratio from 1.7 to 1.4 (p = 0.003), while the ejection fraction (EF) was unchanged (55% versus 52%). The right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) decreased from 50% to 43% (p = 0.004). Thus, radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated that left ventricular contractility was reduced in patients with acute myocardial infarction and that beta-adrenergic blockade further decreased left ventricular contractility and right ventricular performance.\r"

Thirty-eight patients with surgically-proven sarcomas were evaluated. All patients had gallium and thallium studies. Nineteen patients underwent pre- and post-chemotherapy thallium and evaluation. Seven patients also had technetium-99m-MDP (99mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy comparisons. Pathologic changes pre- and postchemotherapy were graded on the basis of %tumor necrosis as defined histologically. Scintigraphic comparisons demonstrated a high degree of correlation with 201TI and poor correlation with 99mTc-MDP. Thallium-201 was superior to 99mTc-MDP and 67Ga in predicting tumor response to chemotherapy as determined by %tumor necrosis determined histologically. Gallium was superior to Tc-MDP in predicting response to chemotherapy. However, both 67Ga and 99mTc-MDP appear to be affected by factors other than tumor activity.\r"

Radiation dosimetry calculation indicated that the radiation dose to the brain was minimum, 0.039 rad/mCi, while the large intestine wall received the highest dose, 0.28 mrad/mCi.

The study revealed significant (p less than 0.05) temporary depression of the bone marrow in all doses in the therapeutic (greater than 40 Gy) range. Palliative (20 Gy) doses caused significant leukocyte depression but insignificant (p greater than 0.05) depression of platelet and packed cell volumes when compared to control animals. A mild transient rise in the levels of serum alkaline phosphatase occurred immediately following radioisotope administration. All hematologic parameters had returned to normal by six weeks after the last injection of radioisotope. The study indicates potential for this compound as a safe, therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for treatment of cancer bone metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "In search for an alternate treatment for inoperable cancer of the lung in humans, we investigated the possibility that introduction of radioactive material into a selected lobe of the canine lung would effectively destroy that lobe without systemic effects or radiation injury to adjacent organs. Ten million ion exchange microspheres labeled with 740 MBq of phosphorus-32 (32P) were injected through a catheter placed in a selected lobar branch of a pulmonary artery in 12 anesthetized dogs. Six additional dogs served as controls and received 10 million microspheres not labeled with 32P. Organs were harvested from 1 wk to 12 mo after injection and examined grossly and histologically. There was progressive organization and contraction of each necrosed 32P treated lobe which was reduced to a scarred remnant by 12 mo, whereas only minimal inflammatory changes occurred in controls. Of the 32P injected dose, 94% remained in injected lobe, 4%-5% in nontargeted lobes and less than 0.08% in blood. Radioactivity in liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, and bone marrow was less than 0.1% for each organ. Thus, large doses of radiation in the order of 1,500 Gy can be effectively delivered to a selected lobe to produce a \"radioisotopic pulmonary lobectomy.\"\r"

For this purpose, four rectangular gamma camera detectors were arranged as close to the head as possible, and united in a block to insure detector head registration and alignment as well as to enable rotation stability at high speeds. Phantom and clinical studies performed demonstrated 42 sequential, 4-mm thick transaxial images acquired in one scan and with sufficient volume to permit the entire cerebrum and cerebellum to be imaged with high sensitivity. The central field of view reconstructed spatial resolution measured 7.0 mm full width of half maximum utilizing the high-resolution collimator, and tomographic images of arbitrary planes including sagittal and coronal demonstrated equally high resolution. The high sensitivity and high speed rotational acquisition capability of the device permits dynamic SPECT studies to be carried out in the analysis of rapidly varying radiotracer concentrations.\r"

The axial resolution of the camera is measured at 11.9 mm at the center. High axial sampling is achieved with 5.125 mm separation of the image planes such that three-dimensional imaging of an object can be carried out in a single scan. Recovery of volumetric distribution of radioactivity and object dimensions in axial and sagittal views is demonstrated by imaging spherical objects 13 mm to 39 mm in diameter.\r"

This design offers high spatial resolution in all three dimensions, high sampling density along all three axes without scanner motion, a large axial acceptance angle, good energy resolution, and good timing resolution. This results in three-dimensional imaging capability with high sensitivity and low scatter and random backgrounds. The spatial resolution is 5.5 mm (FWHM) in all directions near the center. The true sensitivity, for a brain-sized object, is a maximum of 85 kcps/microCi/ml and the scatter fraction is a minimum of 10%, both depending on the lower level energy threshold. The scanner can handle up to 5 mCi in the field of view, at which point the randoms equal the true coincidences and the detectors reach their count rate limit. We have so far acquired [18F]FDG brain studies and cardiac studies, which show the applicability of our scanner for both brain and whole-body imaging. With the results to date, we feel that this design results in a simple yet high performance scanner which is applicable to many types of static and dynamic clinical studies.\r"

The lack of dead area on the periphery of the camera is made possible by a unique application of digital electronics and optimal position estimation using maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. The ML estimates are calculated directly from photomultiplier tube responses and stored in a lookup table, so the restriction of calculating the position estimates in separate circuitry is removed. Each module is designed to be optically and electronically independent, so that many modules can be combined in a large system. Results from a prototypical module, which has an active crystal area of 10 cm X 10 cm, are presented.\r"

In vivo biodistribution of IBF in rat indicated that this agent concentrated in the striatum region and displayed a remarkably high target-to-nontarget ratio (striatum/cerebellum = 48 at 120 min post-injection). The in vitro binding studies suggested that IBF binds selectively to D-2 dopamine receptors with high affinity and low nonspecific binding (Kd = 0.106 +/- 0.015 nM, Bmax = 448 +/- 18.2 fmole/mg protein). Ex vivo autoradiography results in rats further confirmed the high uptake and retention of this agent in the basal ganglia region. The planar images of monkey brains (lateral view of the head) after i.v. injection of [123I]IBF clearly demonstrated that D-2 dopamine receptors can be visualized. With the excellent in vivo stability to deiodination and high target-to-nontarget ratio, [123I]IBF may be useful as a CNS D-2 dopamine receptor imaging agent for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in humans.\r"

We describe a radioisotope technique to measure septal angulation errors over the entire collimator surface to +/- 0.05 degrees (RMS). A simple computer simulation is used to estimate a tolerance level, based on a 1% degradation in reconstructed resolution, of 0.25 degrees (RMS) and 0.6 degrees (max.) for collimator septal deviations. We also point out two methods for collimator linearity correction during SPECT reconstruction.\r"

Within 4 hr after unilateral arterial occlusion, IMP almost completely redistributed at 150 min postinjection in the affected areas. At 2 min postinjection, both a remarkable decrease of IMP accumulation and histopathologic change of diminished staining were observed in these areas. The redistribution amplitude was higher in the affected hemisphere, especially in the regions surrounding the ischemic core than in the unaffected hemisphere. These findings were consistent with computer simulation studies of the time course of brain activity based on the standard diffusible tracer model. The results suggest that IMP redistribution in the ischemic area is due to differences of the temporal changes of the brain activity between the unaffected and affected areas and that it is a \"physical\" phenomenon (only flow related) rather than a \"biologic\" one.\r"

After i.v. injection of 250-300 microCi [123I]HIPDM lung images were recorded at 2 min by a gamma camera interfaced with a PDP computer. Banded lung demonstrated higher [123I]HIPDM radioactivity than that of nonbanded lungs. The activity ratio of banded-to-nonbanded lungs ranged from 4.0 to 1.22 (average 1.62). Technetium-99m-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) lung images showed decreased perfusion in banded lung, and normal perfusion in the nonbanded lung. Postmortem microscopic changes in pulmonary arteries and veins were compatible with the elevated pulmonary artery and venous pressure in vein-banded lung. Whether the high uptake of [123I]HIPDM in banded lungs relates to endothelial receptors for HIPDM is unknown. Nevertheless, the finding of high lung uptake in banded lung in [123I]HIPDM lung imaging may be potentially used to diagnose individual pulmonary vein stenosis.\r"

Joint aspirate as well as blood cultures were reported as no growth; the patient was treated with intravenous colchicine and ACTH for 10 days with dramatic improvement noted. Labeled leukocyte imaging, repeated 12 days after the initial study, revealed near total resolution of joint abnormalities, concordant with the patient's clinical improvement. This case demonstrates that while acute gouty arthritis is a potential pitfall in labeled leukocyte imaging, in the presence of known gout, it may provide a simple, objective, noninvasive method of evaluating patient response to therapy.\r"

With green beans and Brussels sprouts, only about 25% of the fecal dry weight could be accounted for as fiber, whereas with the other investigated vegetables, 40-47% was fiber. Of the remaining part, 11% on average was fat, and 18% was crude protein. Fiber in carrots and peas was the least degraded, with approximately 47% of the polysaccharide intake being excreted in feces. By contrast, the breakdown of the fiber in green beans and Brussels sprouts was more extensive, with a mean of 23% of the polysaccharides being recovered. Among individual fiber constituents, glucose, mannose and uronic acids were least fermented, with considerable differences between vegetables. Total excretion of bile acids was reduced only when Brussels sprouts were added, whereas the concentration of fecal bile acids was lowered with all vegetables except rutabagas. However, no uniform change in fecal bile acid pattern could be detected.\r"

  ".W": "The function of pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase (PPH) of pancreatic secretion in the hydrolysis of dietary polyglutamyl folates (PteGlun) in humans is unclear. In this study, PPH was detected in pancreatic juice collected from pigs during both fasting and postprandial conditions. The secretion of PPH was markedly increased following feeding. Pancreatic PPH showed the following characteristics: 1) endo/random hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl peptide bonds of Pte-Glun substrates, yielding folic acid as the terminal product; 2) maximum activity at pH 4.0-4.5 and maximum stability at pH 7.0; 3) stimulation of activity by Zn2+ and 2-mercaptoethanol; 4) Km values for pteroyltriglutamate (PteGlu3) of 28.7 microM at pH 4.0 and 9.1 microM at pH 5.0; 5) apparent molecular weight of 29,000; and 6) isoelectric point within the range of 8.5-9.0. On the basis of PPH activity, volume of the postprandial secretion and pH profile of enzyme activity, it is suggested that pancreatic PPH may act in vivo in folate digestion and absorption to initiate the deconjugation of dietary PteGlun prior to the action of jejunal brush border PPH.\r"

Neocortices of the offspring were examined at 30 d of age by light and electron microscopy. All maternal restrictions in vitamin B-6 reduced the number of higher order dendrites on stellate neurons in layer II and on pyramidal neurons in layer V of the neocortex and decreased synaptic density in the neuropil of the neocortex. The findings indicated that vitamin B-6 restriction during gestation, either marginal or severe, was the critical treatment factor that adversely affected synaptogenesis and at least one event in neuron differentiation in the neocortex, the arborization of dendrites.\r"

The diets used in these studies were adequate in phosphorus and other essential nutrients. Aluminum added to constitute 0.30% of the diet severely depressed growth and reduced feed efficiency, bone ash and plasma phosphorus in male Ross x Leghorn chicks. At the same time, 0.15% added aluminum mildly depressed growth, feed efficiency and bone ash but had no effect on plasma phosphorus levels. The reduction in bone ash was relatively mild, and no clinical signs of rickets were observed. In laying hens, diets containing 0.15% added aluminum did not affect egg production, but 0.30% added aluminum reduced production significantly. Long-term exposure to aluminum increased percent shell in both groups receiving aluminum, whereas egg weight remained similar to that in controls. There were no changes in hatchability or bone ash associated with dietary aluminum. Although dietary aluminum influenced bone aluminum content, egg aluminum content was not affected. These studies indicate that dietary aluminum interferes with systems in addition to phosphorus metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased milk folate secretion in iron-deficient rat dams contributes to the impairment of folate metabolism in nursing pups. The present study was designed to assess whether impaired milk folate secretion secondary to iron deficiency is due to a decrease in the supply of folate to the mammary gland or to an inability of the mammary gland to effectively use folate. Rats were fed diets containing 0.5, 2.0 or 7.0 mg folate/kg and 8 (-Fe) or 250 (+Fe) mg Fe/kg throughout gestation and until d 17 of lactation. Regardless of dietary Fe content, maternal plasma, red blood cell, liver and kidney folate concentrations correlated with dietary folate content (r = 0.75-0.85, p less than 0.0001). With the exception of plasma folate level, which was 46% lower for -Fe than +Fe dams fed 0.5 mg folate/kg, no other differences in indices of folate status were noted between +Fe and -Fe dams. Dietary folate content had a direct impact on milk folate content in +Fe dams but not in -Fe dams. Mammary tissue methionine synthase and folylpolyglutamate synthetase activities were not depressed in Fe deficiency; rather, mean activities were elevated among -Fe dams fed 0.5 mg folate/kg. In conclusion, the reduction in milk folate secretion during Fe deficiency is not due to a decrease in the amount of folate supplied to the mammary gland; rather, the defect causing this reduction is specific to the mammary gland.\r"

Rats fed the linoleic acid-rich rather than the oleic acid-rich oil had increased heart MnSOD activity but had unchanged plasma and HDL cholesterol levels.

The first three treatment groups were fed either 1) milk from control cows, 2) milk from control cows with 500 ng bST/mL added directly to the milk or 3) milk from bST-treated cows. Treatments 4, 5 and 6 were the same as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, except that the milk was heat-treated before being fed. Although injection of bST into hypophysectomized rats (0, 5, 20 or 80 micrograms bST/d) resulted in a dose-dependent response in average daily weight gain, width of the tibial epiphyseal growth plate and fractional weights of selected organs, ingestion of milk containing added bST (resulting in intakes of 1.3 +/- 0.03 mg bST/d) had no effect on these growth indices. Levels of immunoreactive bST in milk from bST-treated cows were not significantly different from those of untreated cows (4.2 +/- 1.9 ng/mL versus 3.3 +/- 1.7 ng/mL, respectively, p greater than 0.05). Heat treatment reduced the immunoreactive quantities of bST in milk by 85 to 90% (p less than 0.001). Feeding heat-treated milk to hypophysectomized rats resulted in reduced liver weights (p less than 0.001) compared to those of similar rats fed milk that was not treated by heat. The effects of milk from bST-treated cows were not different from those of milk from untreated cows following oral ingestion by hypophysectomized rats.\r"

Five-day food intakes and weight gains of rats fed the imbalanced diets were depressed. The concentration of the limiting amino acid was low in brains of rats fed diets containing LNAA that compete with either tryptophan or histidine for entry into brain. Correlations were observed between the brain concentrations of most individual LNAA and either the ratios of the plasma concentration of that LNAA to the sum of the other LNAA, or the predicted rates of influx of that LNAA. Cumulative food intakes were correlated with brain concentrations of the limiting amino acid, tryptophan or histidine. Food intakes were not consistently correlated with concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA because these compounds were altered only in brains of rats in the tryptophan study. Competition among amino acids for uptake into brain appears to be involved in the feeding response of the rat to dietary disproportions of amino acids, but this response is not directly related to changes in brain concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA.\r"

Utilizing a computerized laboratory result system, all complete blood counts (CBCs) with RBC indices performed between May 1986 and May 1987 were retrieved. Patients having mean corpuscular volumes (MCVs) more than three standard deviations from the mean (greater than 98.5 fL) were selected for evaluation. SETTING: The primary care clinics of a public university hospital. PATIENTS: 138 (3.7%) of 3,805 adult outpatients had MCVs greater than 98.5 fL, and of these, 128 (93.4%) had medical charts available for review. RESULTS: 55 patients with elevated MCVs were not evaluated for this finding, and their mean MCV (100.6 fL) was significantly lower than that of the 73 patients who were evaluated (102.5 fL; p = 0.003). The investigation of macrocytosis included vitamin B12 and folate levels consistently, and the reticulocyte count and peripheral smear were examined infrequently. Five patients had vitamin B12 deficiency, and two had hypothyroidism. Macrocytosis was ascribed to alcohol abuse in 47 patients, six of whom had no laboratory evaluation. Nine alcoholic patients with macrocytosis had other causes for this finding. Among the 55 patients whose macrocytosis was not evaluated, 12 were anemic and one had a peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant and treatable disease was often associated with macrocytosis in our study. Macrocytosis was common, and its recognition and evaluation were variable in this primary care outpatient setting.\r"

DESIGN: Observational study with 11-month follow-up. SETTING: Outpatient hypertension clinic at the Seattle Veterans Administration Hospital. PATIENTS: 59 males (51% of those eligible) with diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg for greater than or equal to 6 months; 57 patients (97%) completed the study. INTERVENTION: Gradual reduction of medications unless diastolic BP rose above 95 mm Hg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensity of treatment with BP medications was assessed using a scale of their comparative \"vigors.\" 35 patients (59%) reduced medications successfully. By the end of the study, systolic BP had risen by 8.2 +/- 12.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in successful patients, while diastolic BP did not change significantly. Two predictors of treatment reduction were statistically significant in both univariate and multivariate analyses: successful patients had been treated more intensively (2.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 \"vigor units,\" p = 0.0001), and they had been enrolled in the clinic longer (5.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 3.1 +/- 2.3 years, p = 0.003). Lower systolic BP, higher urinary sodium excretion, lower compliance, and younger age were significant predictors of treatment reduction on univariate analysis only. Age less than or equal to 65 years had the highest sensitivity (86%) for treatment reduction, while treatment with two or more \"vigor units\" had the highest specificity (79%) and likelihood ratio (3.3). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment reduction is feasible in many well-controlled hypertensives, though systolic BP rises. Patients with high intensity and long duration of treatment are most likely to reduce medications successfully.\r"

The study also examined whether the form reliably distinguishes among residents scoring between 6 and 9. Agreement among attendings rating the same individual was weak (average reliability = 0.64, by the method of James).

DESIGN: Pre- and postfeedback audits with interventions and observations repeated over six consecutive academic years. SETTING: The adult primary care practice of housestaff in a university-affiliated hospital. SUBJECTS: All 139 physicians in an internal medicine residency program from 1981-82 through 1986-87, of whom 37 were present for three consecutive years. INTERVENTION: Each year, residents were given individualized, detailed, typewritten feedback based on audits of their outpatient records. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Each resident physician had a minimum of four (mean 5.2) outpatient records per year audited against standards for record-keeping practices and the provision of preventive care. Overall performance scores for each resident audit improved from a mean of 39.7 +/- 12.3 (SD) in 1981-82 to a mean of 58.5 +/- 14.1 (SD) in 1986-87 (possible range 0 to 100, observed range 9.4 to 86.6). The overall performance scores of individual residents, who received two cycles of feedback, improved an average of 11.5 (95% confidence limits 7.6, 15.3), from a mean of 48.4 +/- 11.4 (SD) during their first year of residency to 59.8 +/- 13.9 (SD) during their third year. General (primary care) and traditional-track residents improved at similar rates, although mean performance scores were consistently higher for general than for traditional-track residents. Analysis of variance revealed that all changes and differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: An ongoing chart audit and feedback system can be associated with improvements both in the performance of individual residents and in the long-term performance of a residency program.\r"

Students rated the likelihood of achieving certain professional goals by specialty. Internal medicine-pediatrics was ranked almost identically with internal medicine and pediatrics. However, internal medicine-pediatrics differed from family medicine in that it was ranked higher in intellectual stimulation, association with interesting colleagues, attaining a position of leadership, entering a respected profession, and involvement in science and research (p less than 0.0001).

The response rate was 86%, including 166 (76%) of 217 residents and 246 (93%) of 264 attendings. Of 12 educational activities, attending rounds were ranked seventh by residents in their perceived value. Both residents and attendings favored sessions that lasted 90 minutes or less and were held three to four times per week. Most respondents felt case presentations should take 5 minutes or less and be delivered away from the patient's bedside. On average, residents preferred less time at the bedside than did attendings (25% vs. 34% of attending round time). Residents desired substantial control of the agenda for rounds and also wanted to be responsible for one-third of the teaching. The attending-physician attributes that residents valued most highly were fund of knowledge, availability, and relating well to housestaff. Since residents' and attending physicians' attitudes may differ, expectations regarding attending rounds should be clarified at the beginning of a ward rotation so that mutually acceptable goals can be established.\r"

  ".W": "While a substantial number of patient contacts with internists occur over the telephone, there is little information about the nature and content of these encounters. The authors surveyed patient-initiated phone calls that resulted in a physician response for seven general internists. Over a six-month period, 1,377 telephone encounters met inclusion criteria. Calls were generally short, 73% lasting 4 minutes or less; mean time per call was 3.4 minutes. The doctor spoke to the patient directly 79% of the time and to a relative in 15% of the calls. The most common reason for phoning the doctor was a symptom or medical complaint (45% of all calls), followed by questions about test results (16%) and medication queries (14%). Over 60% of calls dealt with chronic conditions. Diagnoses encountered over the telephone were similar in frequency to those seen in outpatient clinic visits; however, a notable proportion of calls dealt with topics beyond the scope of traditional internal medicine training programs. A medication response was the reason for 22% of the phone calls. The doctors recommended changes in follow up 12% of the time; these included early visits to the clinic, evaluation in the emergency room, and direct admission to the hospital. An appreciation of the scope of telephone medicine in terms of both medical skills applied and time committed is germane to trainees and practitioners alike.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature, frequency and effects of internal medicine housestaff and faculty contacts with pharmaceutical representatives (PRs). DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors surveyed internal medicine faculty at seven midwest teaching hospitals and housestaff from two of the teaching programs. The survey asked about type and frequency of contacts with PRs and behavior that might be related to these contacts. T-tests and logistic regression were used to estimate the relationship between reported physician contacts and behavioral changes. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty faculty (78%) and 131 house officers (75%) responded to the survey. RESULTS: Faculty and housestaff averaged 1.5 brief contacts per month with PRs. Housestaff averaged more than one meal/month at pharmaceutical company expense. Twenty-five percent of faculty and 32% of residents reported changing their practices at least once based on PR contact. Independent predictors of faculty change in practice were brief or extended conversations and free meals. Predictors of faculty requests for formulary addition were brief conversations and receipt of honoraria or research support. Only brief conversations independently predicted housestaff changes in practice. CONCLUSION: Academic housestaff and faculty have frequent PR contact; such contact is related to changes in behavior. The potential for influence of PRs in academic medical centers should be recognized, and their activities should be evaluated accordingly.\r"

  ".W": "Efforts by hospitals to minimize the frequency of malpractice claims require knowledge of which patients file claims and why. Utilizing a case-control method to investigate the characteristics of patients, of providers, and of the course of care at a university hospital, the authors found several factors to be associated with notification of an intent to file a claim. White collar workers, patients dissatisfied with their care, those who experienced more complications, and those admitted to a particular medical floor were more likely to make a claim. There was no significant association between notice of a claim and complexity of care as indicated by number of diagnoses, invasive procedures, blood tests, and x-rays. Furthermore, the number of different primary care physicians and different consultants did not influence the patient's decision to pursue legal action. Attention to these findings may help avert malpractice claims; however, further study with a larger sample is needed to validate these results.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to compare the results of treatment obtained with mandibular symphyseal and iliac crest bone grafts used for reconstruction of alveolar clefts. The study included 40 patients with unilateral cleft lip palate (UCLP): 20 consecutive patients whose defects were reconstructed with mandibular bone grafts (MBG) and 20 randomly selected UCLP patients who underwent reconstruction with iliac crest bone (ICB). The age at surgery varied from 8 to 13 years (mean age MBG group, 9.1 years; ICB group, 10.3 years), and the postoperative observation period varied from 12 to 33 months (mean, 19 months). Transverse expansion of the maxilla was not completed until after the bone grafting in the group of patients receiving MBGs, whereas it was completed before surgery in the ICB group. The observed marginal bone level on cleft-related teeth was similar in both groups. No periodontal complications were present in any of the patients, and the amount of attached gingiva was similar in both groups. In the MBG group, 15% of the canines were retained, whereas 20% of the canines were retained in the ICB group. The only complication that developed was in a patient from the MBG group, in whom a partial dehiscence of the donor site was observed. The results of this study demonstrate that reconstruction of alveolar clefts with MBG or ICB has a comparable prognosis. The use of MBGs in these patients has several advantages compared with ICB, including reduced operating time, reduced morbidity, reduced hospitalization time, and finally, a cutaneous scar at the iliac crest can be avoided.\r"

Postoperative bleeding following Le Fort I osteotomies generally presents as epistaxis and usually occurs initially within the first 2 weeks following surgery. Treatment modalities that have been used to successfully arrest postoperative hemorrhage include anterior and/or posterior nasal packing; packing of the maxillary antrum; reoperating with clipping or electrocoagulation of bleeding vessels, or the use of topical hemostatic agents in the pterygomaxillary region; external carotid artery ligation; and selective embolization of the maxillary artery and its terminal branches.\r"

This retrospective study was based on examination of lateral cephalometric radiographs of 19 individuals (16 females and 3 males) with a mean age of 26.6 years. These radiographs were evaluated presurgically, immediately postsurgery, and 3 years postsurgically (2 years, 9 months to 4 years, 5 months). The mean amount of sagittal surgical advancement was 6.7 +/- 2.3 mm, and the mean amount of postsurgical relapse was 1.3 +/- 2.0 mm, representing a 14% relapse of the original surgical advancement. However, individual variation in the amount and direction of movement of the mandible was found during the follow-up period. Postsurgical relapse was found to be related to the amount of surgical advancement. Linear-regression analysis between these two variables resulted in an R2 value of 0.448. Fourteen of the subjects relapsed in the posterior direction, with 2 relapsing more than 50% of the surgical advancement. Five of the subjects moved further anteriorly, with 1 advancing as much as 50% more than the original advancement. The findings of this study suggest that mandibular advancement with the sagittal ramus osteotomy and rigid fixation does not provide consistently stable postsurgical results. However, when compared with previously reported relapse studies using nonrigid fixation techniques, rigid fixation yielded superior results.\r"

  ".W": "In a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer among Chinese men and women in western North America and the People's Republic of China, a common protocol was used to assess past life-style characteristics of 905 cases diagnosed during 1981-1986 and 2,488 controls. Risks for cancers of both the colon and rectum increased with increased food energy from fat, protein, carbohydrate, and all energy sources combined, for both sexes and on both continents. Yet, in multivariate analysis, colorectal cancer risk was significantly associated only with saturated fat; no relationships were seen with other dietary sources of energy. Colon cancer risk was elevated among men employed in sedentary occupations. On both continents and in both sexes, risks for cancers of both the colon and rectum increased with increasing time spent sitting. Further, the association between colorectal cancer risk and saturated fat was stronger among the sedentary than among the active. Risk among sedentary Chinese Americans of either sex increased more than fourfold from the lowest to the highest category of saturated fat intake. Among migrants to North America, risk increased with increasing years lived in North America. These observations suggest (a) that colorectal cancer risk increases with duration of exposure to a sedentary life-style and a diet rich in saturated fat; (b) that higher incidence among Chinese-American men relative to women is due to longer duration of these habits among men, who have lived longer in North America; and (c) that higher risk among Chinese Americans of both sexes relative to risk among the general population in China is due to differences in such habits. Attributable risk calculations suggest that, if these associations are causal, saturated fat intakes exceeding 10 g/day, particularly in combination with physical inactivity, could account for 60% of colorectal cancer incidence among Chinese-American men and 40% among Chinese-American women.\r"

Because the tumor-associated haptoglobin interferes with the innate and adaptive immune functions, elimination of the haptoglobin by passive removal or by active therapy could be an important adjunct for immunotherapy in cancer patients.\r"

Serum levels of the nutrients in 103 men who developed prostate cancer during the subsequent 13 years were compared with levels in 103 control subjects matched for age and race. Although no significant associations were observed with beta-carotene, lycopene, or tocopherol, the data suggested an inverse relationship between serum retinol and risk of prostate cancer. We analyzed data on the distribution of serum retinol by quartiles, using the lowest quartile as the reference value. Odds ratios were 0.67, 0.39, and 0.40 for the second, third, and highest quartiles, respectively.\r"

Because estradiol metabolism is also cytochrome P450 mediated and linked to breast cancer risk, indoles may similarly reduce estrogen-responsive tumors in humans. We examined several indoles in female Sprague-Dawley rats for induction of hepatic estradiol 2-hydroxylation. The most potent inducer, indole-3-carbinol, was administered to humans (500 mg daily for 1 wk). It significantly increased the extent (mean +/- SEM) of estradiol 2-hydroxylation from 29.3% +/- 2.1% to 45.6% +/- 2.1% (P less than .001). These results indicate that indole-3-carbinol strongly influences estradiol metabolism in humans and may provide a new chemopreventive approach to estrogen-dependent diseases.\r"

We previously demonstrated that, although sodium sulfate did not affect the proliferation rate of colonic mucosa, as indicated by thymidine-labeling index, it did lower fecal pH in subjects at average risk for colon cancer. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of sodium sulfate on fecal pH and proliferation of colonic mucosa in subjects at high risk for colon cancer. Fifty-seven patients who had had colonic polyps removed were randomly assigned to two groups to receive either sodium sulfate (27 patients) or a placebo (25 patients) at a mean dose of 4 g/day for 14 days. Age, sex, height, and weight were comparable in both groups. Before intervention, levels of fecal pH were similar in the two groups, but after intervention, fecal pH was reduced only in the sodium sulfate group (mean decrease, 0.3 U; P less than .01). Thymidine-labeling index (number of labeled cells per number of cells counted) was similar in the two groups prior to intervention and did not change significantly after intervention (mean increase, 0.9%; P = .35). Regression analysis revealed no correlation between the change in labeling index and the change in fecal pH. We conclude that high fecal pH level is only indirectly associated with the development of colon cancer and, therefore, may be a secondary, rather than a primary, measure of cancer risk.\r"

Over 2 to 6 months of growth, in vitro cells demonstrated a rapid and significant decrease in their ability to form spontaneous lung colonies. Such a decrease depended on the conditions of culture. We suggest that the in vitro environment influences the phenotype of cells with respect to their capacity for spontaneous metastasis. This possibility must not be ignored, when conclusions obtained from studies of established cell lines are extended to cancers.\r"

ASCOT values are related to survival probability using the logistic function and regression weights reaffirm the importance of head injury and coma to the prediction of patient outcome. The ability of TRISS and ASCOT to discriminate survivors from non-survivors and the reliability of their predictions, as measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, were compared using Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) patient data. ASCOT performance matched or exceeded TRISS's for blunt-injured patients and for penetrating-injured patients. ASCOT performance gains were modest for blunt-injured patients. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics suggest that ASCOT reliably predicts patient outcome for penetrating-injured patients and nearly so for blunt-injured patients. Statistically reliable predictions were not achieved by TRISS for either set. ASCOT provides a more precise description of patient physiologic status and injury number, location, and severity than TRISS. The ASCOT patient description may be useful in relating to other important outcomes not highly correlated with TRISS or the Injury Severity Score (ISS) such as disability, length of stay, and resources required for treatment.\r"

Two patients died before repair could be attempted. Eleven nephrectomies were performed. Vascular repair was attempted in the remaining 24 renal units either as isolated procedures or combined with renal parenchymal repair. Compared to 78 patients with only parenchymal injuries, those with renovascular injuries were more severely injured as assessed by nephrectomy rate, Injury Severity Score, transfusion requirement, number of major complications, and death. Fifteen patients sustained main renal artery injuries of whom six underwent immediate nephrectomy. Nine attempts at repair were performed. Six patients had either persistent thrombosis or preservation of only marginal function. One patient died in the immediate postoperative period of associated injuries. Complete renal preservation was achieved in only two kidneys (14%). Nephrectomy was required for the management of three of 12 main renal vein injuries, but in none of ten patients with segmental vascular injuries.\r"

  ".W": "The medical, legal, and ethical problems associated with routine HIV screening have led to the recommendation that all patients should be presumed to be seropositive and thus protective measures should be taken by all health care workers. This philosophy, termed \"universal precautions,\" has been difficult to adhere to or enforce, however. Nevertheless, in some trauma population subsets, the prevalence of HIV seropositivity runs as high as 19%, and thus presents an occupational hazard to the trauma health care worker. The mainstays of universal precautions (UP) are barrier techniques against body fluid contact and protection from inadvertent needlestick. To judge compliance with a strict UP protocol, surgical residents engaged in trauma room resuscitations were observed on a random basis by trauma nurse coordinators. Previously, UP had been discussed in conferences and by memo. Over 2 months, 81 trauma rooms were observed, involving 18 house officers. Overall, there was only 16% compliance with strict UP. The most common protocol variations involved sharps technique. While glove use was nearly universal, protective eye wear, ankle and foot protection, and body protection such as gowns or aprons were commonly ignored. Even in the presence of invasive procedures such as endotracheal intubation or insertion of chest tubes, compliance was less than 40%. The reasons most commonly given by house officers for the lapse in UP were not knowing the protocol, forgetting the protocol, or not having time to implement the protocol. Even for the nine patients residents identified as suspected of being in a high-risk category, UP was strictly adhered to only once. Compliance with universal precautions is difficult to achieve under the best of circumstances. It cannot be assumed that passive informational measures can achieve this goal. Active infection control surveillance and ongoing housestaff inservice are required to minimize the risk of inadvertent injury or contamination.\r"

Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were obtained within 2 weeks of discharge and serially at intervals of 3 to 6 months. In addition, 16 patients injured 1 to 11 years previously (mean, 33 months) were recalled to determine long-term respiratory disability (Group II). Standard spirometric pulmonary function measurements were obtained. The mean age (36 yrs) and ISS (34) were the same in both groups. The majority of patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation, averaging 21 days in Group I and 18 days in Group II. PFTs were markedly abnormal soon after injury, averaging 40 to 50% of predicted values for all tests performed. Rapid improvement in all parameters was noted by 4 months after discharge and pulmonary function had almost returned to normal by the last followup exam (average, 65 to 90% of predicted). Results in Group II demonstrated continued improvement over long periods of followup. All patients who were employed preinjury had returned to work by 6 months after discharge except one. Long-term respiratory disability was present in less than 5% of patients studied. We conclude that recovery from severe chest injury occurs rapidly in most patients and serious long-term respiratory disability is uncommon. These results justify the commitment of major resources to the intensive care of patients with severe chest injuries.\r"

Sonography proved to be the most accurate modality for acutely assessing fetal status. There was one (4%) maternal death, consistent with predicted mortality (TRISS methodology). Four pregnancies were lost and one neonate died because of injuries sustained, not because of surgery or anesthesia. There was significant difference between the ISS (average, 9) and CTS (average, 16) of women with surviving pregnancies or successful deliveries and the ISS (average, 30) and CTS (average, 12) of women who lost pregnancies or witnessed neonatal death. Fetal outcome relates to direct fetal injury and to the acute hemodynamic insult associated with maternal trauma. Maternal evaluation and treatment should occur in a stepwise and organized fashion following the general principles of trauma care (ATLS guidelines) in conjunction with perinatal specialists. Uterine ultrasonography should be an integral component of the initial evaluation. With expedient resuscitation, evaluation, and intervention, maternal and fetal survival can be expected.\r"

A review of 2,620 charts identified 194 pediatric patients whose scalps served as donor sites for split-thickness skin grafts for the treatment of acute burns. The overall incidence of alopecia was 32%. However, the incidence of alopecia in unburned scalps was 13%. The occurrence of alopecia in this group was associated with larger burn area requiring more frequent use of the scalp and shorter intervals between graft harvests (p less than 0.05). Among this group of patients (n = 15), nine had mild spotty alopecia, four had surgically correctable alopecia, and two had global patchy alopecia not amenable to surgical correction. In the patients with concomitant burns to their scalps, the incidence of alopecia was 61%. Whether the burn or the graft harvest caused alopecia could not be established. Meticulous donor site care is mandatory in this latter group when the scalp donor site is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperglycemia is often seen in trauma patients and its etiology is not clearly understood. We have determined parameters of glucose metabolism by using simultaneous primed-constant intravenous infusion of both [6-3H] glucose and [U-14C] glucose in ten severely traumatized hypermetabolic subjects during the early \"flow phase\" of injury and in six post-absorptive normal volunteers. The mean rate of glucose production (determined by means of [6-3H] glucose) was 3.96 +/- 0.40 mg/kg/min in trauma patients, which was significantly (p = 0.025) higher than the value of 2.75 +/- 0.13 observed in normal volunteers. Glucose turnover rates determined with [U-14C] glucose as tracer were lower in all subjects. The difference between the turnover rates determined by the two tracers represents an index of recycling of glucose through three-carbon fragments. This recycling index was similar in both groups of subjects in amount (0.24 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.08 mg glucose/kg/min) but different when expressed as percentage of total glucose turnover (5.6 +/- 1.4% vs. 9.8 +/- 1.7%; p = 0.05). The absolute rates of glucose clearance, oxidation, and recycling were similar in stressed trauma patients and unstressed controls although the rate of production was increased by 44% due to injury. Post-trauma hyperglycemia was mainly due to an increased hepatic output of glucose and not due to a decreased ability of the tissue to extract glucose from the plasma. Hyperglycemia may be the driving force in the metabolic effects of injury.\r"

Only one of eight immunologic activities assayed distinguished between these groups of subjects. It was observed that the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins (Ig) in vitro by the circulating B cells of the trauma patients was markedly impaired when compared to Ig synthesis by B cells of the elective surgery patients or controls. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the B cells, and not the T cells, Null cells, or monocytes, were defective in the trauma patients. The results indicate that diminished Ig synthesis and secretion by the circulating B cells of the trauma patients cannot be attributed to the surgery; rather, it appears that the defects in the B cells are a direct result of the trauma.\r"

In the present study the effectiveness of an initial 4 ml/kg bolus infusion of HSD on cardiovascular function and fluid resuscitation requirements after a major burn injury was evaluated in anesthetized sheep following a 40% BSA scald burn. One hour after injury resuscitation was initiated by a rapid intravenous bolus infusion (4 ml/kg) of either hypertonic saline-dextran (7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran 70) (HSD) or the same volume of normal (isotonic) saline (NS). Lactated Ringer's was later infused as needed to maintain cardiac output at 90% of baseline. HSD rapidly and effectively restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure significantly better than the same volume of NS. Hemodynamic improvement by HSD was short lived, and need for further fluid therapy was only marginally delayed (HSD 38 +/- 8 min, NS 20 +/- 3 min; p = 0.06) (mean +/- SEM). The total requirements for fluid therapy during the first 6 hr postburn were not reduced by the initial HSD bolus (HSD 3,145 +/- 605 ml, NS 2,905 +/- 495 ml; n.s.), nor was skin edema formation reduced. We conclude that in anesthetized sheep HSD resuscitation was only transiently effective in treating burn shock. This may be attributed to the sustained increase in vascular permeability and continued plasma leak following thermal injury.\r"

Twenty-six (8%) of the 322 cases for which complete autopsy data were available had major thoracic vascular injuries. Twenty-five deaths occurred within 6 hours of injury. The majority of patients had at least one AIS 6 injury. The aorta was the most frequently injured vessel. Major thoracic vascular injuries are more common among children than previous reports suggest, probably because they are rapidly fatal. Many deaths occur in the field, at local hospitals, or in transit before the patient can reach a trauma center. Efforts to reduce the number of total thoracic vascular injuries should focus on primary and secondary prevention.\r"

Two of the remaining 25 succumbed to extra-abdominal injuries within 24 hours, leaving 23 patients, who were followed clinically for an average of 34.7 days. None was ever discovered to have sustained intestinal perforation. Throughout the study period, 27 patients were seen who had sustained intestinal perforation from blunt abdominal trauma. Nine were explored based upon an initial physical examination suggestive of peritonitis. The remaining 18 underwent DPL: 17 demonstrated gross blood, and only one patient was diagnosed solely by an elevated DPL:WBC. We conclude that DPL:WBC is a nonspecific indicator of intestinal perforation from blunt abdominal trauma, and prospective studies are needed to properly define its role. Sequential determinations of DPL:WBC may be useful in the diagnosis of intestinal perforation.\r"

Both cases involved patients in hypovolemic shock at the time of attempted subclavian vein cannulation. Their injuries were confirmed by preoperative arteriography, and primary arterial repair was successful in each. Based on our experience, we make the following recommendations: 1) subclavian vein cannulation with large-bore catheters should be avoided in hypovolemic patients; 2) suspected cases of iatrogenic arterial injury should be evaluated arteriographically; and 3) primary repair to prevent subsequent thrombosis, rupture, or embolization should be performed after confirmation of the injury.\r"

Local recurrence and metastatic disease probably result from undetectable microscopic metastases present at operation. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy may improve cure rates if administered adjuvantly. The outcome of individual patients who share surgical stage cannot be predicted reliably by tumor histology, pathological and/or nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. Two groups of 10 patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma were similar by sex distribution (5 men and 5 women), surgical stage (stages T1 in 1, T2 in 6 and T3a in 3 patients) and age (54.3 +/- 15.2 standard deviation versus 55.8 +/- 8.7 years). Group 1 had no recurrences with a minimum followup of 5 years and a mean followup of 10 years. Group 2 died of metastatic renal cell carcinoma after a mean of 5 years. All neoplastic areas of each paraffin-embedded operative specimen were randomly sampled and the nuclear perimeter of 150 cancerous cells was digitized. There were 25 shape descriptors calculated for each nucleus. All shape descriptors for each patient were described by 19 statistical tests. Nuclear perimeter and area as well as mean nuclear roundness factor failed to separate the 2 groups. Range median quartiles of ellipticities by Fourier analysis, coefficients of variation of chain code minimums and relative means of largest 10 convexity values produced greatest separation (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test p less than 0.001, and variance normalized difference 3.21, 3.29 and 2.83, respectively). These descriptors normalized and summed provided near perfect separation (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test p less than 0.001 and variance normalized difference 3.59). We developed a quantitative nuclear morphometric analysis system that permitted the correct assignment of outcome in 19 of 20 patients. Accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma by nuclear shape analysis may allow for selection of patients for adjuvant therapy who have clinically undetectable metastatic disease.\r"

The history and physical examination, sleep rigidity and tumescence monitoring, hormonal assays, duplex ultrasonography with papaverine, and cavernosometry and cavernosography, formed the basis of categorizing each patient into 1 of 5 etiological groups. These groups included neurogenic, moderate arterial, severe arterial, venous and fibrotic causes for organic erectile dysfunction. The cavernous smooth muscle and endothelium in each patient appeared to be normal on light and electron microscopy. We conclude that cavernous biopsy is of limited value to determine therapeutic options in patients with erectile dysfunction.\r"

The largest group of patients had vasculogenic erectile failure (56%). At the end of followup 50% of the patients were no longer performing injection. Those who discontinued injection therapy were slightly older and had more vasculogenic erectile failure. The nonfibrotic complications were mild in all instances and did not result in discontinuation of injection therapy. These complications consisted of small hematomas in 20.9% of the patients, mild discomfort in 13.6% and mild liver enzyme abnormalities in 9.8%. No episode of priapism or infection occurred during therapy. Fibrotic complications consisted of nodules or plaques, and correlated significantly with the number of months on injection and the number of injections. At 12 months the fibrotic complication rate was 31 +/- 8.6%. Our study suggests caution regarding the long-term complication rate of intracavernous injection therapy with these compounds and underscores the importance of routine followup examinations. While injection therapy is an effective form of treatment for erectile failure, it is not a satisfactory alternative for many patients and is associated with a significant fibrotic complication rate.\r"

The accuracy of staging transurethral resection, A1/A2 substaging and probability of progression tables for predicting cancer progression was evaluated in untreated patients with stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate who were followed for at least 5 years. Survival free of disease was predicted correctly in 93% of 52 patients who underwent staging transurethral resection of the prostate, 92% of 96 with the probability tables and in 85% of 96 using a common criteria for A1 and A2 substaging. Staging transurethral resection of the prostate upgraded patient risk in 7% of the low risk patients predicted by the probability tables and 14% of the stage A1 cancer patients. Staging transurethral prostatectomy and the probability of progression tables were more accurate in predicting survival free of disease than the A1/A2 substaging system. Comparison of the predictive accuracy of staging transurethral prostatectomy to that of the probability of progression tables showed no significant difference. There was no additional benefit from combining the 2 methods. When the probability of progression tables are used to predict cancer progression it may be unnecessary to use staging transurethral resection of the prostate in the patient with stage A prostate cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Positive margins were analyzed in 189 clinical stage B radical retropubic prostatectomies. Margins were identified by serially blocking the entire specimens in planes selected for optimum demonstration of capsule surface. Positive margins were divided into 2 categories: 1) those associated with capsular penetration of cancer and 2) those caused by inadvertent surgical incisions through the capsule into intracapsular cancer. Data were analyzed separately at each of 6 anatomical sites. Frequency of positive margins was related to the volume of cancer. Cancer of greater than 12 cc constituted a distinctive category in which seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastases and multiple positive margins were found in the majority of cases, signifying minimal possibility of cure. However, 31 positive margins occurred among 136 patients (23%) who were potentially curable by the criteria of normal seminal vesicles and absence of pelvic lymph node metastases; 17, of these 31 surgically positive margins (55%) occurred at the apex. Positive capsular penetration margins at the apex were volume-related, while negative margins were not. Site specific recommendations for avoiding positive and negative capsular penetration margins are suggested. The prostate apex, rectal and lateral surfaces, bladder neck and superior pedicles accounted for 48, 24, 16 and 10% of all positive margins, respectively. Dissection of the apical prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia require modifications of current surgical techniques if positive margins are to be avoided. Serum levels of prostate specific antigen may require as long as 5 years to become detectable when only 1 positive margin is the only evidence of nonorgan-confined disease.\r"

The relationship of seminal vesicle invasion to lymph node metastasis was statistically significant but cancer volume and histological grade were much stronger predictors of lymph node metastasis. The route of invasion from the prostate in 46 cases involved direct tumor spread into the midbase region near the ejaculatory ducts. Seminal vesicle invasion often may not be identified if the tissue nearest the ejaculatory ducts at the prostate base is not sampled.\r"

Urodynamic studies were performed before, and at various times up to eight months after operation. Over the same period biopsies were taken for physiological and histological studies. By three weeks after transection all animals had developed bladder instability, the abnormal contractions being maintained for the duration of the study. Concomitant with this change was the development, in vitro, of a non-specific detrusor smooth muscle supersensitivity similar to that which occurs in obstructed animals. By contrast with the latter group there was, however, no loss of cholinergic nerve from the transected bladder muscle. The transected (decentralised) minipig may be a useful model for the study of bladder instability not associated with outflow obstruction. The findings suggest that anatomical denervation is not a prerequisite for unstable contractions although a functional loss of nerve may be of importance. Supersensitivity, however, appears to occur in both obstructed and nonobstructed instability.\r"

  ".W": "Current therapy of human superficial bladder cancer includes the intravesical administration of antitumor drugs and immunomodulators. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether phospholipid liposomes that bind to human bladder cancer cells can improve the delivery of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) to neoplastic urothelium. The antiproliferative activity of free IFN-alpha and IFN-alpha encapsulated in liposomes was assessed in vitro against the human transitional cell carcinoma line 253J. The cells were exposed to free and liposome-encapsulated IFN-alpha for short periods ranging from 30 minutes to four hours, and inhibition of cell growth was determined three days later. The production of greater than 25 percent cytostasis of 253J cells by free IFN-alpha required four hours of continuous exposure. In contrast, IFN-alpha encapsulated in liposomes produced 35 percent and 60 percent cytostasis after a 30-minute and four-hour exposure, respectively. Liposome-encapsulated IFN-alpha was also effective (50 percent cytostasis) against a subline of 253J cells selected for resistance against free IFN-alpha. Liposomes containing IFN-alpha were stable in the presence of human urine. In vivo studies in mice showed that intravesical administration of radiolabeled IFN-alpha or radiolabeled liposomes did not yield significant systemic absorption and deposition in distant organs. Collectively, these results suggest that the encapsulation of IFN-alpha within multilamellar liposomes may augment its antiproliferative activity, overcome some forms of tumor cell resistance to IFN-alpha, and prove useful for intravesical therapy of superficial bladder cancer.\r"

Establishment of a transitional epithelium over the de-epithelialized surface of a segment of intestine might alleviate these complications. Twenty Holstein bull calves underwent sigmoidocystoplasty. Fourteen experimental animals had the epithelium of the sigmoid removed before augmentation. Six calves with intact mucosa served as controls. Fifteen calves survived the study: 11 experimentals and four controls. Cystectomies were performed at four, six, eight, or 12 weeks. Ninety-one percent (10/11) of the experimental calves had almost complete epithelialization of the de-epithelialized graft. All experimental animals had residual colonic mucosa or mucoceles. Nine of 11 experimental calves (82%) had greater than 25% contracture of the sigmoid graft. Two animals had less than 25% graft contracture (1) or formed a wide-mouthed true diverticulum (1) in the grafted segment. All control animals formed a wide-mouthed true diverticulum and had no graft contracture.\r"

Blood samples for catecholamine assay were collected from the flaccid penis, the erect penis after cavernous nerve stimulation and during detumescence induced by sympathetic trunk stimulation. Epinephrine concentration was not significantly different in these three stages. However, norepinephrine concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.005) during induced detumescence from 505 +/- 311 [pg./ml.] to 747 +/- 489 [pg./ml.]. Intracavernous application of norepinephrine abolished cavernous nerve induced erection in a dose dependent manner. Sympathetic trunk stimulation reduced or abolished erection induced by acetylcholine or by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. We conclude that norepinephrine is an important neurotransmitter in the control of penile detumescence.\r"

  ".W": "Although studies exist using both male and female rats, there are virtually no studies that compare male and female bladder function. In this initial study, in-vivo and in-vitro urinary bladder function was investigated in two age groups of male and female rats (sexually immature and sexually mature). These studies compare in-vivo micturition behavior (water intake, urine output, frequency and volume per micturition); and in-vitro whole bladder function (bladder volume/pressure relationships, the ability of the in-vitro bladders to generate pressure and empty in response to bethanechol and field stimulation). The results can be summarized as follows: 1) The 24 hour water intake, urine output, and volume per micturition for the mature male rats was significantly greater than that of the mature females with no significant differences among the immature females, mature females, or immature males. 2) There were no significant differences in the frequency of micturition between the 4 groups. 3) Although the average plateau pressures (cystometrograms) of the immature and mature female bladders were greater than that of the immature and mature male bladders, the compliance was similar for all groups. 4) The maximum pressure response of the mature female bladder was significantly greater than pressures generated by bladders in the other three groups; there were no age or sex related differences in the bethanechol log ED50 values. 5) There were no age or sex-related differences in the bethanechol log ED50 values or maximal expulsion responses. 6) Field stimulated bladders from mature animals generated significantly greater intravesical pressures than bladders from immature animals, but, there were no significant differences in maximal pressures attained between mature male and female bladders nor between immature male and female bladders. In conclusion, micturition behavior, and the maximal pressure response to bethanechol changed dramatically with sexual maturity. These results are consistent with the idea that estrogen and other hormones may have a marked influence on bladder function and micturition behavior.\r"

Because of conflicting reports on the relative levels of EGF-R in prostate tumors as measured by binding of radiolabelled EGF, we have examined EGF-R expression at the level of the specific messenger RNA using a sensitive RNase protection assay. Expression of the mRNA for EGF-R was higher in carcinoma (CaP, N = 38) than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, N = 35) samples (p less than 0.01). The highest levels of EGF-R mRNA were found in the human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, PC-3 and DU145. Among the CaP samples, there was an association of higher EGF-R mRNA levels with higher tumor extent and dedifferentiation. Since EGF has also been found in prostatic tissues, the enhanced expression of the EGF-R gene may play a role in the growth of prostate tumors, possibly by an autocrine pathway.\r"

Rates of solute transport were compared by analysis of rate constants for each experiment. Sodium and bicarbonate are secreted while ammonium and chloride are absorbed by both ileum and colon. Potassium is absorbed by ileum and not transported by colon. There is a tendency for water movement into the bowel lumen with both intestinal segments. Quantitatively, the amount of bicarbonate secretion and the increase in intraluminal pH is greater with ileum than colon. There is a net osmolar absorption from ileum but not colon. Hydrogen ion or ammonium absorption accounts for the majority and bicarbonate secretion the minority of the acid load in both ileum and colon. Ammonium appears to be absorbed either along with chloride or in exchange for sodium.\r"

Urinary excretion of electrolytes, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) and kallikrein, clearances of creatinine, inulin and para-amino-hippuric acid (PAH), serum aldosterone level and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined. On the exposed side there was a significant increase in urinary flow and urinary NAG excretion, and a significant fall in urinary osmolality. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was reduced and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) unchanged, thus filtration fraction (FF) was increased. Extraction of PAH was significantly reduced compared with the control kidney. On the control side there was a significant increase in urinary flow and excretion of electrolytes, and a significant fall in urinary osmolality. GFR was increased and ERPF unchanged. FF therefore increased also on this side. The mean rise of PRA in the exposed kidney was higher than in the control kidney, the difference being not significant (p = 0.09). Our results may indicate a triggering of the renin-angiotensin system, and an effect on proximal tubular function following exposure of extracorporeal shock waves.\r"

Ten frail, institutionalized volunteers aged 90 +/- 1 years undertook 8 weeks of high-intensity resistance training. Initially, quadriceps strength was correlated negatively with walking time (r = -.745). Fat-free mass (r = .732) and regional muscle mass (r = .752) were correlated positively with muscle strength. Strength gains averaged 174% +/- 31% (mean +/- SEM) in the 9 subjects who completed training. Midthigh muscle area increased 9.0% +/- 4.5%. Mean tandem gait speed improved 48% after training. We conclude that high-resistance weight training leads to significant gains in muscle strength, size, and functional mobility among frail residents of nursing homes up to 96 years of age.\r"

Sequential substance-dependent patients admitted before institution of the policy (n = 455) were compared with patients admitted after institution of the policy (n = 457). Patients completed self-administered questionnaires regarding smoking practices and attitudes. Seventy-six percent of patients were current cigarette smokers. Fifty-eight percent of patients after institution of the policy described themselves as \"not smoking regularly,\" compared with 19% of patients admitted before the institution of the policy. Similar proportions of patients admitted before and after the institution of the policy believed that quitting smoking would threaten recovery. Forty-one percent of patients hospitalized after institution of the policy abstained from smoking for more than 1 week during their hospital stay. Rates of early termination of treatment did not change. We conclude that concurrent intervention for nicotine addiction during inpatient treatment of substance dependence is associated with a temporary reduction in smoking and increased motivation to quit smoking.\r"

Two-millimeter punch biopsy specimens were obtained from treatment sites at the beginning and end of the study period for electron microscopy. Anchoring fibrils within the epidermal-dermal junction of skin treatment sites were quantitated by blinded, standardized, computer-assisted morphometry. After 4 months of continual daily treatment, skin sites that received topical tretinoin showed double the anchoring fibril density compared with vehicle control sites (1.34 anchoring fibrils per micron of lamina densa vs 0.65, respectively). The possible mechanisms by which topical tretinoin increases anchoring fibrils in skin include the drug's property of inhibiting collagenase, a dermal enzyme that degrades anchoring fibril collagen. We speculate that increased numbers of collagenous anchoring fibrils within the papillary dermis of human skin is one of the connective-tissue correlates of the clinical improvement observed in photoaged skin after treatment with topical tretinoin.\r"

A total of 180 case reports were submitted, including 26 in which the resident died as a result of substance abuse. The prevalence of substance abuse among trainees was 2%. Sixty-one (74%) of the responding training programs submitted a total of 113 case reports of resident reentry into anesthesiology training. The success rate of reentry in the parenteral opioid abuser group was 34% (27/79). The success rate of reentry for the nonopioid abuser group was 70% (16/23).

Death as the initial relapse symptom occurred in 16% (13/79) of the parenteral opioid abusers who were allowed to reenter anesthesiology training.

GEC proliferated in response to EGF but not IGF-1, MSA or PDGF. Specific, saturable receptors for EGF were detected in saturation and competition binding studies utilizing 125I-EGF with an approximate Kd of 1.7 nM and 86,000 binding sites per cell. TGF-beta inhibited GEC growth in a time and dose dependent manner with a brief early exposure resulting in prolonged growth inhibition which was not reversible by EGF. Exposure to TGF-beta sufficient to maximally inhibit growth had no effect on EGF binding to GEC. More prolonged exposure to TGF-beta, however, did result in an increase in the apparent number of EGF receptors on GEC but no change in Kd. These studies suggest that EGF and TGF-beta released by inflammatory cells or platelets during the course of glomerular injury may play a role in modulating glomerular cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Conventionally, complement activation by hemodialysis membranes has been determined by measuring fluid phase C3a. Based on such measurements, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes have been classified as weak activators compared to cuprophan. Previous studies have demonstrated, however, that PAN adsorb fluid phase C3a. Based on that observation, we hypothesized that complement activation by PAN might be artifactually underestimated if relatively large amounts of C3a remained membrane bound. In the present study, a method that allows the simultaneous quantification of both fluid phase and membrane bound C3a was used to assess complement activation by PAN and cuprophan. Pieces of membrane were incubated with C3-depleted serum that had been repleted with radiolabeled C3. Subsequently, the supernates and membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and complement activation was quantified by determining the radioactivity of the C3a bands in the gel. The results showed that while the serum exposed to cuprophan membranes contained almost five times more C3a than that exposed to PAN, approximately 80 times more C3a was bound to the PAN membranes. Consequently, the total amount of C3a generated in the presence of PAN was higher than that generated in the presence of cuprophan. We conclude that assessment of complement activation by hemodialysis membranes using fluid phase C3a measurements alone may be misleading.\r"

AVP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were obtained with the varying Ca2+ media described above, though the increases in [Ca2+]i were quantitatively variable. AVP-induced cellular cAMP production was examined during three minute incubation period in the presence of 5 x 10(-4) M 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine.

  ".W": "Because of the recently observed augmentation of medullary hypoxic injury by calcium in isolated perfused rat kidneys (Kidney Int 34:186-194, 1988), renal morphology of chronic, prolonged hypercalcemia was investigated in vivo. Rats were treated with repeated injections of vitamin D2 (400,000 units/week) for two to eight weeks. Chronic elevation of plasma calcium from 2.1 to 2.8 mmol/liter (P less than 0.001) was associated by a fall in maximal urine osmolality with no change in glomerular filtration rate. The most significant morphological alterations occurred in the inner stripe of the outer medulla; these changes were characterized by a sequence of active injury with subsequent destruction and atrophy of the medullary thick ascending limbs, fibroblastic and lymphocytic infiltration, and secondary dilatation of collecting ducts. Similar changes occurred in the medullary rays. These alterations were accompanied by increased renal prostanoid production and a predisposition to acute kidney failure from indomethacin. Because of its selective occurrence in zones of poorest oxygen supply, this inner stripe injury may derive from vulnerability to hypoxia and may play a role in some chronic nephropathies.\r"

The contribution to disease progression of both glomerular and interstitial infiltrating leucocytes was studied throughout the disease evolution. Leucocyte subsets were quantitated with an immunoperoxidase technique using monoclonal antibodies for rat leucocyte surface antigens: OXI (total leucocytes) OX6 (Ia positive cells), OX8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T cells), OX19 (total T cells), OX22 (B cells and subsets of T cells), and ED1 (macrophages/monocytes). In the glomeruli, macrophages and Ia positive cells were significantly increased when sclerotic lesions appeared, but T lymphocytes and subsets of T lymphocytes were not found. However, in the interstitium, all leucocytes were identified and increased in number throughout the disease evolution. Early in the disease, monocytes and lymphocytes were both present in large numbers, but at the end stage of the process, the predominant infiltrating leucocytes were CD4+ve T cells. In FGS rats treated throughout the disease with oral prednisolone (begun after disease induction), renal function was significantly better than in the untreated group, whereas the sclerosis and leucocyte accumulation in the glomeruli were unchanged. However, prednisolone treatment resulted in significantly fewer interstitial leucocytes and especially reduced the numbers of CD4+vc cells. These results suggest that the glomerular sclerotic lesions are related to the participation of macrophages independent of T cells, and that immune mechanisms mediated by T cells in the interstitium have an important role in the progression of this disease to end-stage renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The isolated kidney preparation, which allows the study of renal function under controlled in vitro conditions, was chosen to compare the natriuretic effect of the loop diuretic, bumetanide, to that of two other diuretics (amiloride and hydrocholorothiazide) acting on different parts of the nephron. Concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4) M were tested in 4-week-old MHS and MNS. Our results showed that the natriuretic response to all diuretics was greater in MHS as compared to MNS when evaluated as absolute Na+ excretion (UNA+); this is likely because of the faster basal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the hypertensive strain (874 +/- 126 in MHS vs. 556 +/- 33 microliters.min-1.g-1 k wt in MNS, P less than 0.05). However, when calculated either as a difference from basal values (delta UNa+), or per ml of glomerular filtration rate, the response of MHS kidneys to amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was similar in the two strains: delta UNa+ after amiloride at (10(-4) M was + 2.1 +/- 0.7 in MHS versus + 1.2 +/- 0.2 mumol.g-1.g-1 k wt in MNS; after hydrochlorothiazide 10(-4) M it was + 1.7 +/- 0.9 in MHS versus + 1.1 +/- 0.4 mumol.min-1.g-1 k wt in MNS, values not statistically different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since C5b-9 has also been connected to the development of sclerosis in animal models of glomerulonephritis, we addressed the question whether C5b-9 would affect the collagen synthesis. We used human glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) obtained as primary outgrowth cultures. The cells were cultivated in the presence of 14C-proline. Collagen synthesis was quantitated by counting the radioactivity associated with collagenase digestible material. Furthermore, collagen was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GEC in culture produce spontaneously some collagen type IV. Addition of sublytic doses of highly purified C5b-9 increased the collagen synthesis considerably within 12 to 24 hours. In the absence of C9, C5b-8 stimulated collagen synthesis to a similar extent, whereas in the absence of C7 or C8, the collagen synthesis was not enhanced. Furthermore, fluid-phase-formed C5b-9 complexes did not stimulate the collagen synthesis, indicating that assembly of the complex on the target membrane was required. Since C5b-9 deposits are found in sclerotic areas, our data support the hypothesis that C5b-9, by stimulating collagen synthesis as well as release, might contribute to the development of chronic nephritis.\r"

Transient concentrative uptake of oxalate (\"overshoot\") was observed in the presence of an inside alkaline (pH = 8.5 inside, 6.5 outside) pH gradient, but this pH gradient-stimulated oxalate uptake was abolished by 1 mM DIDS, indicating that DIDS-sensitive and -insensitive oxalate uptake mechanisms were present. The DIDS-sensitive oxalate uptake was temperature-dependent and saturable with a Km of 0.0365 mM and a Vmax of 1.38 nmol.30 second-1.mg protein-1. In addition, oxalate was transported into the osmotically active internal space. In the presence of the pH gradient, a change in transmembrane potential had no effect on pH gradient-stimulated oxalate uptake. Oxalate was exchanged for OH and this exchange was sensitive to inhibition by DIDS. Inhibition by DIDS, furosemide and probenecid facilitated the distinction of oxalate:OH exchange from formate:Cl and oxalate:Cl exchange. In preparation of our brush border membrane vesicles, no apparent SO4:HCO3 exchange was present. These data indicate that oxalate:OH exchange occurs on the brush border membrane.\r"

To identify factors that might alter the rate of decline in renal function, we reviewed records of 200 patients from the Nephrology Clinic of the Durham VA Medical Center who had chronic progressive renal insufficiency. The average rate of decline in renal function (slope of reciprocal plasma creatinine versus time) was -0.80 +/- 0.62 (SD) ml/mg month in 112 black patients and -0.84 +/- 0.59 in 88 white patients. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the patient's age, level of diastolic blood pressure and type of antihypertensive treatment had a significant effect on the slope of reciprocal creatinine whereas the patient's race and diagnosis did not. In individual patients, addition of minoxidil or a calcium channel blocker to other medications significantly lowered blood pressure and slope of reciprocal creatinine. Some antihypertensive medications lowered blood pressure without significantly affecting the slope. These data suggest that specific medications may have a favorable effect on the progression of chronic renal disease by mechanisms in addition to reduction of blood pressure.\r"

To address gaps in the literature, data from a 1984 national survey were used to compare drinking patterns and their sociocultural correlates among male, black (n = 723) and male, white (n = 743) Americans. Findings from the survey indicate that, at the aggregate level, black and white men exhibit very similar drinking patterns. The proportion of abstainers, infrequent, frequent and heavier drinkers is very similar for the two groups of men. However, major black-white differences occur when the relationship between drinking rates and major social characteristics is considered. Bivariate tables suggest that frequent heavier drinking among whites is associated with youthfulness, high-income status and residing in \"wetter\" areas, whereas among blacks these patterns are reversed or absent. Log-linear analysis confirmed some of these findings. When drinking behavior was modeled with respect to race, age, income and region, race emerged as an independent predictor and the effects of age and income varied by race. When the two groups of men were analyzed separately, age and region were the only significant determinants of heavier drinking among whites. Among blacks, income and age emerged as significant variables and the influence of age differed from the findings for whites. The results suggest that there may be important differences in the cultural environments of drinking in black and white men.\r"

Almost one-fourth of the sample were classified as heavy drinkers in Year 12, and half had previously used alcohol in a substitution pattern. Classifications into one of three substitution groups (none, low and high) and multivariate analysis of variance were carried out to identify background and baseline factors related to substitution and long-term behavioral outcomes 12 years after entering treatment. Substitution was found to be related to higher levels of alcohol problems and treatment before addiction, parental alcohol problems, to vulnerability to peer influence in starting drug use and to feelings of rejection by peers during adolescence. In terms of 12-year outcomes, substitution was related to more use of nonopioid drugs, more heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems and more psychological dysfunction symptoms (such as depression). These results showed a strong relationship between substitution and preaddiction as well as postaddiction alcohol abuse. However, to delineate the effects of substitution apart from the effects of previous alcohol abuse, additional analyses were computed in which substitution was examined after controlling for previous alcohol abuse. The results confirmed the validity of substitution as a powerful construct in identifying behavioral differences before and after addition.\r"

This fall off by adult offspring appears to follow community norms; it occurs, on the average, at the level of daily drinking by fathers, and when the mother approaches daily-drinking levels. An aversion effect holds more to cross-sex parents with problems; thus, both sons and daughters show a nonimitation and fall off to their cross-sex parents who are high-volume problem drinkers. Conversely, however, daughters often imitate a high-drinking father with no problems. For high-drinking mothers, without problems or with problems (numbers are small), daughters' drinking appears \"polarized\": most (60%) are abstemious, but a higher number than expected (about 35%) show high volume thus imitating the mother's volume, compared to about 17% of the total sample of daughters who were high-volume drinkers. Maximal offspring imitation is strongest for abstemious parents, especially for abstaining parents, and stronger for fathers abstaining than for mothers.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the results obtained with two measures of alcohol consumption, a quantity-frequency (QF) method and a retrospective diary method, using a worksite sample. In order to control for the possibility of order effects, a subsample was chosen for readministration of the alcohol measures, when the order of presentation of the two measures was reversed for half of the subsample. Varying the order of presentation of the alcohol consumption items did not significantly affect the results obtained, except for an interaction effect between drinking group and order of presentation. Although subjects reported greater alcohol use on the diary than on the QF method at lower levels of consumption, the findings were reversed for higher levels of consumption. The relationship between the two measures is linear, with slope less than 1. Overall, subjects reported statistically significantly more alcohol consumption on the diary (mean [+/- SD] = 18.3 +/- 19.1 drinks) than on the QF method (mean = 16.9 +/- 19.5 drinks). The diary measure identified 20.9% of drinkers reporting consumption of more than 28 drinks per week, compared with 17.8% for the QF. However, the diary measure identified only 10.6% of drinkers reporting more than 42 drinks per week, compared with 10.2% for the QF. Consequently, the usefulness of the diary in detecting heavy drinkers appears to decrease with increasing consumption. These findings suggest the need for careful selection of alcohol consumption measures for research purposes and the need for caution in comparing the results of studies using different measures of alcohol consumption.\r"

Initially tested between 1979 and 1981 at ages 12, 15 or 18, these subjects were retested two additional times at 3-year intervals (retest rate = 92%). We wished to determine if offspring of families exhibiting a positive history of alcoholism (FH+) reported a serious alcohol or drug problem (including seeking treatment) at a higher rate than those without such backgrounds (FH-). Analyses indicated that FH+ rates for a self-reported alcohol and/or drug problem were about twice the rate for FH- individuals and about 1.5 times as high as the base rate for the entire sample. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups of troubled youth in terms of alcohol or marijuana use patterns or the frequency of use-related negative consequences. Our data also illustrated that FH+ females were as likely as FH+ males to report a serious problem and that FH+ families reported a higher rate of having more than one troubled offspring. It is of special import that these results are based upon observations of a community-based sample of adolescents and young adults in contrast to studies relying upon clinical samples and retrospective reports.\r"

Increased NSE (greater than 12.0 micrograms/liter) was found in 71.4% of SCLC patients and in 22.2% of NSCLC patients. The predictive value of an increased NSE in identifying SCLC was only 50%, whereas the predictive value of a normal NSE in differentiating SCLC for NSCLC was 91%. Serial studies during chemotherapy of SCLC patients showed that the doubling time of NSE ranged from 7 to 127 days and the mean apparent half-life (AHL) of NSE to be 14 days. AHL values in excess of 20 days suggest that the tumour is not in full remission. We believe that measurement of serum NSE and calculation of the AHL and DT are valuable in identifying the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with SCLC.\r"

Whereas 43% of the patients reported vocational change and 37% reported social change, 88% expressed satisfaction with their posttreatment voices. This may have been due to the perceptions of the relatives, who generally had a more positive view of the patients' voices.

The incidence of postoperative reflux was 22.6%. None of the patients had severe deterioration of blood parameters or nutritional status. Endoscopic observation revealed esophagitis in 24.2% of patients, mainly in the lower esophagus. Histologically, there was a high incidence of infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes, enlarged papillae, and basal cell hyperplasia. Epithelial dysplasia was detected in 41.9% of patients, and of these there were more patients in whom the degree of dysplasia was more severe in the lower esophagus than in other areas. These data suggest that postgastrectomy gastroesophageal reflux is more likely than postgastrectomy changes in nutritional status to be a possible contributory factor to the development of subsequent esophageal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical findings of a population-based colorectal tumor registry have been analyzed to determine elements of supporting or not supporting the existence of different types of large bowel cancer. Age-specific incidence rate of the 409 registered patients rose sharply with increasing age in all segments of the large bowel; however, regarding left colon and rectum, the male: female ratio showed a marked male preponderance, more evident in the more advanced age groups. Histopathology, studied in 87% of patients, revealed adenocarcinoma as the most frequent feature; however, adenocarcinoma with concomitant adenoma (i.e., presumably arising in adenoma) was observed in 14.3% of cancers of the left colon, in 17.7% of rectal tumors, but in only 5.7% of neoplasms of the proximal colon (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively, vs. left colon and rectum). Some histological features (carcinoid and mucinous carcinoma) were observed in right-side tumors only. Analysis of the familial occurrence of cancer showed that a significantly larger proportion of patients with neoplasms located in proximal colonic segments had three or more first-degree relatives affected by (or deceased from) cancer of all sites. Similarly, colorectal tumors among relatives were more frequent in patients with right-side cancer. The location of the 793 polyps observed during 3 years of registration showed that more than 70% of adenomas were located beyond the splenic flexure, overlapping the distribution of cancers. In conclusion, the differences of sex ratio at different colonic subsites, the higher fraction of adenocarcinomas with adenomas in cancer of the more distal tracts of the large bowel, and the more marked familial occurrence of colorectal cancer in patients with right-side neoplasms tend to support the view that cancer of the proximal colon, cancer of the distal colon, and cancer of the rectum may actually be three different types of tumors.\r"

The disappearance time (T1/2) of the radioactive sodium from the muscle of the edematous side was usually comparable to that of the control side. The data also indicate that the impairment of fluid drainage from other areas, such as the lateral chest wall, that normally drain into the axilla, is impaired similarly to that of the subcutaneous fat of the arm. Operative procedures designed to relieve the edema of the arm by providing an alternate route of drainage should provide a conduit for the fluid to an area that does not normally drain to the axilla of the affected side.\r"

In contrast, brachytherapy allows one to deliver a tumoricidal dose to the tumor while limiting the dose to surrounding normal tissue to the tolerance dose. As a pilot study, 125I seeds were implanted into unresectable hepatic metastases, or positive margins of resection, at the time of surgery. This report concerns six patients whose liver lesions were the only known site of disease and in whom precipitous drops in carcinembryonic antigen (CEA) levels followed the implants.

Seven cases of pituitary apoplexy following cardiopulmonary bypass have been reported, including the present case. Transsphenoidal surgical decompression in the present case and those previously reported appears to be safe after cardiac surgery and may be helpful in amelioration of compression of nearby structures.

Serum cholesterol rose in every subject; the mean rise was 0.74 mmol/l after three weeks (range -0.09 to 1.48 mmol/l) and 1.06 SD 0.37 mmol/l or 23% after six weeks (range 0.48 to 1.52 mmol/l). The increase was mainly due to low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, which rose by 29%, but very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also raised, as evidenced by a 55% rise in triglycerides. High-density-lipoprotein cholesterol was unchanged. After supplementation had ended, lipid levels returned to baseline. Boiled coffee thus contains a lipid that powerfully raises serum cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to improve detection of heterozygote carriers of the gene for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency; CAH) 64 families with at least 1 affected member (72 homozygotes and 191 clinically healthy subjects) were studied by HLA genotyping and by the single-dose corticotropin stimulation test. Plasma samples were drawn immediately before corticotropin and 60 min after its injection, and they were analysed simultaneously for eight adrenal steroids by radioimmunoassay after extraction and automated gel chromatography. Heterozygosity was defined as the presence of one HLA haplotype in common with the affected relative. Of the various basal and corticotropin-stimulated steroid levels and their ratios, the ratio of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone after corticotropin had the greatest power to discriminate between heterozygotes and normal relatives; that ratio was significantly higher in the heterozygotes (n = 116) than in the normal relatives (n = 75) and there was no overlap between the groups (range 12.2-214 vs 1.2-11.9). Thus, it is possible to detect all CAH heterozygotes without examining the index case by means of specific steroid analysis.\r"

Gamma camera images of the patient with Kaposi sarcoma showed four discrete lesions along the left foot and calf with no foci along the right foot, and no uptake into clinically enlarged but non-neoplastic lymph nodes. The spread of the Kaposi sarcoma was proximal along the leg. The neoplastic cervical lymph nodes in the second patient who had large-cell diffuse intermediate grade lymphoma were also imaged successfully. Since Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma frequently involve occult sites, liposome imaging may prove useful in the diagnosis and management of these diseases.\r"

Reflux ceased in 113 (79%) of the 143 ureters after a single injection of polytef paste. 20% of ureters in this series required more than one endoscopic injection of polytef paste to correct reflux. Nearly 80% of the 113 ureters corrected after a single injection of polytef required less than 0.3 ml of paste per ureter to correct reflux. 88% of ureters continue to show absence of reflux 2 to 5 1/2 years after endoscopic correction. More than half of the recurrences were only of grade I or grade II severity and required no treatment. 7 ureters had recurrent grade III or IV reflux and were reinjected without any difficulty. The correction of vesicoureteric reflux by endoscopic injection of polytef paste is an outpatient procedure that requires 15 min of anaesthetic time. It is safe, simple, and effective in correcting all grades of reflux. Best results are obtained when the paste is injected precisely into the floor of the submucosal ureter.\r"

  ".W": "Transfusion therapy for sickle cell anemia is limited by the development of antibodies to foreign red cells. To evaluate the frequency and risk factors associated with such alloimmunization, we determined the transfusion history, red-cell phenotype, and development of alloantibodies in 107 black patients with sickle cell anemia who received transfusions. We compared the results with those from similar studies in 51 black patients with sickle cell disease who had not received transfusions and in 19 nonblack patients who received transfusions for other forms of chronic anemia. We assessed the effect that racial differences might have on the frequency of alloimmunization by comparing the red-cell phenotypes of patients and blood-bank donors (n = 200, 90 percent white). Although they received transfusions less frequently, 30 percent of the patients with sickle cell anemia became alloimmunized, in contrast to 5 percent of the comparison-group patients with other forms of anemia (P less than 0.001). Of the 32 alloimmunized patients with sickle cell anemia, 17 had multiple antibodies and 14 had delayed transfusion reactions. Antibodies against the K, E, C, and Jkb antigens accounted for 82 percent of the alloantibodies. Comparison of red-cell phenotypes in the three study groups (the patients with sickle cell anemia, the patients with other forms of anemia, and the blood donors) revealed statistically significant differences between the patients with sickle cell anemia and the donors but not between the patients with other forms of anemia and the donors. These differences are most likely racial. We conclude that alloimmunization is a common, clinically serious problem in sickle cell anemia and that it is partly due to racial differences between the blood-donor and recipient populations.\r"

  ".U": "90259015\r", 
  ".W": "Ornithine carbamoyltransferase is an X-linked mitochondrial enzyme expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes. A deficiency of this enzyme results in central nervous system dysfunction, which may be fatal in newborn boys. Milder forms are seen in older boys and girls and in adults. Establishing the carrier status of women at risk for ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency is important for determining reproductive and medical risks for affected women. We report a test to establish the carrier status of women at risk for ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency. This test relies on the allopurinol-induced accumulation of orotidine, whose synthesis is stimulated by carbamoyl phosphate, a substrate that accumulates in ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency. We used anion-exchange, high-performance liquid chromatography to measure urinary orotidine and orotic acid excretion after the administration of a 300-mg oral dose of allopurinol in 24 women who were obligate heterozygotes, 13 who were probable heterozygotes, 15 mothers of affected boys from monoplex families (families with only one affected member), 12 mothers of affected girls from monoplex families, and 25 normal, unrelated women who were not carriers. Urinary orotidine excretion was increased 3 SD or more above the mean value for the normal women in 95.8 percent of the obligate heterozygotes, 84.6 percent of the probable heterozygotes, 73.3 percent of the mothers of affected boys in monoplex families, and 33.3 percent of the mothers of affected girls in monoplex families, thus establishing that these women were carriers of a mutant ornithine carbamoyltransferase allele. The presence of allopurinol-induced orotic aciduria was not as sensitive or specific an indicator of carrier status as the presence of orotidinuria. We conclude that measurement of urinary orotidine excretion after the administration of allopurinol is a simple and reliable test for the identification of women who are heterozygous for ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency.\r"

  ".U": "90259016\r", 
  ".W": "Widespread concern about the safety of the national blood supply, particularly with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has reportedly affected the use of blood products to support patients. To examine these changes, we conducted national surveys of blood collection and transfusion in the United States in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987 and made a limited survey of these activities in 1988. Transfusions of whole blood and red cells reached a peak of 12.2 million units in 1986, then declined to 11.6 million units in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988. Transfusions of plasma declined from a peak of 2.3 million units in 1984 to 2.1 million units in 1987. Growth in the use of platelet transfusions (6.4 million units in 1987) also slowed; however, the proportion of platelets transfused as platelets from single donors grew from 11 percent in 1980 to 25 percent in 1987. Donations of autologous blood increased sharply, from less than 30,000 units in 1982 to 397,000 units in 1987, equivalent to 3 percent of the homologous-blood collections. The growth in collections of homologous blood slowed after 1982. The supply of homologous blood reached a peak of 13.4 million units in 1986 and did not grow between 1986 and 1988. These trends in red-cell, plasma, and platelet transfusions appear to have continued through 1988. We conclude that the unprecedented decline in transfusions of whole blood and red cells, coupled with the continued importation of packed red cells from Western Europe and the offsetting effect of autologous predeposits, forestalled serious shortages of blood that could have resulted from the decline in collections of homologous blood. We attribute these changes in blood collection and blood transfusion to the effects of the epidemic of HIV infection.\r"

Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, we determined serum immunoreactive erythropoietin levels in 81 anemic patients with solid tumors. For any given degree of anemia, the serum concentration of immunoreactive erythropoietin was lower in this group of patients than in a group of control patients with iron-deficiency anemia (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, the expected inverse linear relation between serum levels of immunoreactive erythropoietin and of hemoglobin was absent in the group with cancer. The erythropoietin response was further decreased in patients receiving chemotherapy; it was not influenced by the presence or absence of cisplatin in the treatment regimen. The inability of the patients with cancer to produce erythropoietin was not absolute; if they had hypoxemia, adequate erythropoietin production was restored. We conclude that erythropoietin levels are inappropriately low in anemia associated with cancer, and that erythropoietin deficiency may contribute to the development of this form of anemia. Treatment of the anemia of cancer with erythropoietin may be of value.\r"

  ".W": "Anemia is a common complication of multiple myeloma. It resolves early in the disease if chemotherapy induces a complete remission, but persists if the disease progresses, causing disabling symptoms and often requiring blood transfusions. We treated 13 patients with myeloma-associated anemia by administering recombinant human erythropoietin three times a week for six months. Eleven patients (85 percent) had steady increases in hemoglobin levels and eventual correction of the anemia. Their symptoms of anemia subsided, and they reported a heightened sense of well-being. No patient had any adverse side effects, particularly episodes of hypertension. Monitoring of the serum M component showed a predominantly stable tumor load without apparent interaction between the underlying disease and the response to erythropoietin therapy. The number of erythroid burst-forming units in the bone marrow and peripheral blood and the level of erythropoiesis in bone marrow smears increased significantly during therapy. Pretreatment serum levels of erythropoietin were higher in the patients who did not respond and in those who required more than two months of treatment before they responded. Serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin concentrations reflected responses to treatment. We conclude that recombinant human erythropoietin is a promising therapeutic tool for treating myeloma-associated anemia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the associations of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with mortality from coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease, we studied 2541 white men who were 40 to 69 years old at base line and followed them for an average of 10.1 years. Seventeen percent had some manifestation of cardiovascular disease at base line, whereas the others did not. Among the men who had cardiovascular disease at base line, we found, after multivariate adjustment, that those with \"high\" blood cholesterol levels (above 6.19 mmol per liter) had a risk of death from cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, that was 3.45 times higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1.63 to 7.33) than that for men with \"desirable\" blood cholesterol levels (below 5.16 mmol per liter). The corresponding hazard ratios were 5.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.59 to 13.51) for LDL cholesterol levels above 4.13 mmol per liter as compared with those below 3.35 mmol per liter, and 6.02 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.73 to 13.28) for HDL cholesterol levels below 0.90 mmol per liter as compared with those above 1.16 mmol per liter. All three lipid levels were also significant predictors of death from coronary heart disease alone (P less than 0.005). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were also significant predictors of death from cardiovascular and coronary heart disease in men without preexisting cardiovascular disease, although at a lower level of absolute risk of death. Thus, the 10-year risk of death from cardiovascular disease for a man with preexisting cardiovascular disease increased from 3.8 percent to almost 19.6 percent with increasing levels of total cholesterol from \"desirable\" to \"high,\" whereas the corresponding risk for a man who was free of cardiovascular disease at base line increased from 1.7 percent to 4.9 percent. Our findings suggest that total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels predict subsequent mortality in men 40 to 69 years of age, especially those with preexisting cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the factors that cause exacerbations of autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. One possibility is an alteration in adrenocortical function, since glucocorticoids are known to alter both pituitary-thyroid and immunologic function. We encountered three patients in whom overt autoimmune thyroid disease developed after unilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenocortical adenoma. We compared the postoperative changes in thyroid function in these patients with those in 21 other patients with Cushing's syndrome who underwent the same treatment. After unilateral adrenalectomy, one of the three patients had transient hyperthyroidism and a low thyroid uptake of 131I, indicative of silent thyroiditis. After the same surgical procedure, the second patient had hypothyroidism, where-as the third patient had transient hyperthyroidism at first, and hypothyroidism then gradually developed. All three patients had serum antithyroid antibodies, the titers of which increased after surgery. In the remaining 21 patients (only 2 of whom had antithyroid antibodies initially), the serum concentrations of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine-binding globulin and the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone increased after surgery from values that were low or near the lower limit of normal to values still well within the normal range. None of these patients had clinically evident thyroid disease or increased antithyroid-antibody titers. We conclude that reductions in the secretion of glucocorticoid may exacerbate subclinical autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenocortical adenoma who have thyroid antibodies should be followed closely after treatment, because thyroid dysfunction may develop.\r"
