  ".W": "This report analyzes the detection rate and role of CT in the preoperative evaluation of 90 consecutive, proved cases of colon carcinoma. In this study, the overall detection rate was 84%; however, the rate varied from 68% in unprepared colons to 95% in clean colons that were adequately distended with air. Sensitivity of detection depends mainly on the size of the lesion and the quality of the examination. CT was less sensitive than barium enema in detection, but it had a similar specificity in differentiating neoplastic lesions from inflammatory lesions. On the basis of our criteria of staging, CT evaluation resulted in a sensitivity of 55% for local invasion, 73% for regional nodes, and 79% for liver metastases. Compared with Dukes classification, CT correctly staged 64% of all patients but showed significant variations in staging different groups with lower results in the Dukes A, B, and C patients. CT, however, showed a sensitivity of 81% and a positive predictive value of 100% in detecting Dukes D lesions. In general, although negative CT findings do not help in staging a colonic tumor, positive findings are highly indicative of neoplastic spread. We believe that this feature justifies the use of CT in the preoperative evaluation of colonic tumors.\r"

Radiographs obtained 3-21 months after treatment showed that 53 (50%) of 106 treated kidneys were free of stones. In 48 of the 53 kidneys that contained stones, the stones were residual fragments dating from the period immediately after ESWL. New stones had developed in only five kidneys. The 50% incidence of stone-free kidneys 3-21 months after ESWL is less than the 65-90% rate reported by other institutions in the United States and Europe. After stone removal by ESWL, new stone formation occurs at a rate of 5%, which is much lower than the expected recurrence rate of 37-50%.\r"

Quantitative radionuclide renography showed a statistically significant (p = .048) decrease in the percentage of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) to the treated kidney. Two of these patients had developed hypertension requiring treatment but became normotensive when given medication. In the other patients there was a statistically significant increase in both systolic (p = .0002) and diastolic (p = .015) blood pressures. Information about blood pressure was also obtained from an additional 71 (48%) of the 148 patients; of the total 91 patients (61%) in whom blood pressures were obtained, seven (8%) had developed sufficiently severe hypertension to require treatment beginning within 21 months after ESWL. Side effects of ESWL for renal lithiasis include hemorrhage, edema, and acute tubular necrosis of the kidney. This form of renal trauma is associated with an immediate decrease in renal function of the treated kidney, and this decrease may be permanent. ESWL is also associated with the onset of hypertension, which may occur immediately or be delayed by several weeks or months. Although the pathogenesis remains unknown, hypertension is an important complication of ESWL in about 8% of patients.\r"

There have been no complications that required therapy. The initial success with our technique and that reported by others suggest that balloon catheter dilatation offers a good alternative treatment for urethral strictures to replace bouginage, urethrotomy, and urethroplasty.\r"

Meniscal cysts also may be discovered incidentally on studies performed for suspected internal derangement. Sixteen cystic lesions of the knee were evaluated with MR, including 11 meniscal cysts and five ganglion cysts. Scans were performed at 1.5 T by using a transmit/receive extremity coil or a receive-only surface coil. Standard spin-echo imaging, including at least one long-TR/asymmetric-TE sequence, was performed in all cases. In six patients, gradient-echo, reduced flip-angle sequences also were done. All meniscal cysts (but none of the ganglion cysts) were associated with horizontal meniscal tears. Cysts were visualized best on the long-TR/TE images; meniscal tears were seen best on the short-TR/TE and long-TR/short-TE images. Meniscal tears and cysts were also seen well on the fast-scanning sequences. Septations were noted in four meniscal cysts and in four ganglion cysts on the long-TR/TE images. Long-TR/TE images were also useful in showing the relationship between the cyst and joint capsule in three of the ganglion cysts. MR imaging is an effective, noninvasive method for evaluating cystic lesions of the knee. Meniscal cysts are always associated with underlying horizontal meniscal tears, which can be detected with MR. Ganglion cysts are not associated with meniscal tears, but may have connections to the joint capsule, which can be detected with MR.\r"

  ".U": "88103158\r", 
  ".W": "New concepts in knee ligament reconstruction have recently emerged, significantly improving the success of surgical reconstruction of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, using high-strength bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts, as well as medial and lateral collateral soft-tissue ligament reconstructions. We reviewed plain radiographs of 50 patients with a total of 72 ligament reconstructions to determine radiographic signs of complications. A major early complication relates to reconstructed ligament positioning. Isometric positioning of the reconstruction is important for all ligaments, but it is most crucial for the femoral portion of the anterior cruciate ligament. Three cases of nonisometric ligament positioning were identified, two anterior cruciate ligaments and one medial collateral ligament. Another early complication is graft fracture, identified in two cases of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Hardware failure did not occur in this series. Late complications include motion of the graft (none in this series) and patellar fracture (one case in this series). Effusions resolved by 4 weeks in 92% of the cases. However, prolonged effusions are usually sterile and should not be mistakenly diagnosed as representing a septic joint if they are an isolated finding. Nonunion of the graft within its osseous tunnel is unusual. Union occurred in 79% of cases by 6 weeks and in 95% of cases by 5 months. Osseous tunnel sclerosis alone is not considered a complication. We conclude that postoperative plain film radiography is important for assessment of graft and hardware position as well as for the detection of early and late surgical complications.\r"

  ".U": "88103159\r", 
  ".W": "The shoulder impingement syndrome refers to a condition in which the supraspinatus tendon and subacromial bursa are chronically entrapped between the humeral head inferiorly and either the anterior acromion itself, spurs of the anterior acromion or acromioclavicular joint, or the coracoacromial ligament superiorly. As a result, the space for the bursa and tendon is reduced, and repeated trauma to these structures leads to bursitis and rotator cuff injury. Although pain and limitation of motion are common early findings, the diagnosis is often delayed until a complete tear of the rotator cuff has occurred. In an attempt to determine if MR can be used to depict the abnormalities associated with impingement syndrome (subacromial bursitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and rotator cuff tear), we reviewed 107 MR scans of painful shoulders. Changes consistent with impingement syndrome were found in 53 patients (50%), 32 of whom underwent subsequent arthrography or surgery. MR was found capable of depicting several soft-tissue and bony abnormalities that have been clinically described in impingement syndrome. In regions of inflammation, we found that the supraspinatus tendon and/or the subacromial bursa were compressed by spurs (25 shoulders), capsular hypertrophy of the acromioclavicular joint (six shoulders), and/or low-lying acromion (14 shoulders). While T1-weighted MR imaging was highly sensitive to abnormalities of the supraspinatus tendon, tendinitis could be differentiated from a small tear of the supraspinatus tendon only with T2-weighted imaging. Large, full-thickness tears, especially if chronic, produced characteristic MR findings on both T1- and T2-weighted images. We conclude that MR can be used to detect several abnormalities associated with the shoulder impingement syndrome.\r"

In addition, normalized organ dose to the breast, active bone marrow, thyroid, eyes, ovaries, and testes were measured in a pediatric anthropomorphic phantom comparing the anteroposterior and posteroanterior projections. The average measured dose to the breast was 6.9 and 4.0 mrad (10(-5) Gy), respectively, for nominal 400- and 600-speed, rare-earth screen-film systems used in combination with breast dose reduction methods. The image quality of these systems as evaluated by three radiologists was rated as adequate. The dosimetry results with an anthropomorphic phantom showed that the posteroanterior projection provides approximately a threefold reduction in breast dose as compared with the anteroposterior view. However, the dose to the bone marrow is doubled. Rare-earth screen-film systems used in combination with simple dose-reduction methods can provide adequate image quality for scoliosis examination while significantly reducing the radiation dose to the breast.\r"

The goal was to study the anatomy of this congenital heart defect with MR imaging. The axial and coronal scans provided the best details. All characteristic abnormalities were seen well: the maintained proximal and faulty distal attachment of the anterior tricuspid leaflet, the absence of both septal and posterior tricuspid leaflets, the size and delineation of the anatomically atrialized chamber of the right ventricle, and the small, compressed trabecular portion with the markedly dilated pumping outflow tract of the right ventricle proper. Our results suggest that MR may furnish valuable information in patients with Ebstein anomaly when echocardiography is either inconclusive or technically difficult to perform.\r"

Surgical findings were available for correlation in 44 of the 248 joints studied. Increased signal caused by myxoid degeneration within the degenerating meniscus was seen, as were pathologic changes including atrophy, fibrosis, and contracture of masticatory muscles occurring with internal derangements. Advantages and limitations of MR are discussed with reference to arthrography and videofluoroscopy. High-resolution and partial-flip-angle images of a normal joint are provided for comparison. In most clinical circumstances, MR is the procedure of choice when examining the TMJ, because it provides contrast resolution of soft-tissue structures superior to that of conventional imaging techniques.\r"

Syringomyelia and the absence of recurrent or residual lesions were documented in all cases. Three patients showed long cysts (multiseptated in two and smooth in one) with low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The flow-void phenomenon related to fluid motion in these three cysts, which were enlarging clinically, was responsible for the hypointensity on the T2-weighted images. In two patients the fluid within the lesions behaved similarly to normal nonpulsatile CSF and may have represented syrinx cavities in a state of \"arrested growth.\" Three patients had surgical decompression under real-time intraoperative sonographic control, which showed the presence of intramedullary cyst-fluid pulsations in two cases and the absence of cyst-fluid pulsations in one case. These sonographic observations correlated with the MR findings. We postulate that these syrinx cavities form as a result both of the effect that the original extramedullary lesion had upon the underlying spinal cord and the subsequent postoperative alterations in the CSF dynamics at the level of prior surgery. Syringomyelia should be considered in patients with recurrent or new symptoms who previously had surgery for extramedullary lesions.\r"

MR was equal or superior to CT myelography in depicting cases of cord enlargement, cord compression, and cord atrophy, providing better tissue characterization, no shoulder artifact, and no limitation caused by CSF block. CT myelography was superior to MR in depicting cases of spondylosis and arachnoiditis. It showed superior spatial resolution, which was most pronounced when comparing axial images and hence particularly superior in detecting the lateral extent of disk herniation. Use of surface coils and thin imaging sections is essential for accurate and complete MR evaluation of the cervical and thoracic spine.\r"

The fistulas were located at C1-C2 in 45%, C2-C3 in 25%, C4-C5 in 15%, C5-C6 in 10%, and C6-C7 in 5%. Trauma was the most common cause: 30% followed knife wounds, 20% followed gunshot injuries, and 10% followed blunt trauma. Eight patients had spontaneous fistulas, two associated with fibromuscular dysplasia. Three patients-all with large, long-standing fistulas-developed neurologic deficits coincident with the abrupt closure of the fistula, which resolved with reestablishment of fistula flow. Two of these patients were treated by staged closure; the other one by gradual closure. In all three cases the result was complete fistula closure without neurologic sequelae. The remaining spontaneous fistulas were all closed by balloon embolization with preservation of the vertebral artery and without deficits. The six patients with traumatic fistulas without transection were cured by balloon embolization, without deficits; in four there was also preservation of vertebral flow. The other six patients had traumatic fistulas with transection and were all cured by balloon embolization with preservation of flow in two. Four patients required bilateral approaches to the fistula to achieve complete fistula closure. The only complication was a mild residual Wallenberg syndrome after occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery in the treatment of a transection located at C1. In our opinion, transvascular techniques are the treatment of choice for vertebral arteriovenous fistulas.\r"

  ".W": "The Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS), a steroid-responsive painful ophthalmoplegia secondary to idiopathic granulomatous inflammation, historically has been categorized as a diagnosis of exclusion because of its nonspecific radiologic presentation. Five patients who satisfied the anatomic and clinical criteria of this syndrome underwent high-resolution CT of the orbital apex/cavernous sinus region. Two patients were diagnosed as having orbital apex pseudotumor, two as having cavernous sinus inflammation, and one as having a cavernous sinus epidermoid by the characteristic CT and clinical findings. Follow-up studies while the patients were asymptomatic demonstrated complete resolution of the CT abnormalities in four patients and clinical improvement in all five patients. Our data suggest that orbital apex pseudotumor and granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus have similar clinical features and should be considered as part of the spectrum of THS. With the advent of high-resolution CT, THS may now be a diagnosis of inclusion. Symptomatic improvement after steroid therapy is an essential but not absolute proof of the syndrome, since lesions such as lymphomas may also respond to steroids. Resolution of the soft-tissue inflammation of CT is an additional criterion for diagnosis.\r"

We evaluated the use of the percutaneous techniques 52 times in 50 patients. The right femoral vein was used in 37 of the procedures, the right internal jugular vein in 12, and the left femoral vein in three. Twenty-two patients had altered coagulation factors: 11 were receiving heparin, four were receiving warfarin sodium, six had hepatic cirrhosis, and one had disseminated intravascular coagulation and had been receiving warfarin sodium. Filter placement was successful in 51 of 52 procedures. In the unsuccessful case, placement was attempted via the left femoral vein; the carrier could not be advanced from the common iliac vein to the inferior vena cava. This patient required surgical occlusion of the cava. There was one major complication, a hematoma in the right side of the groin that required transfusion. This occurred in the patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation who had extensive scarring from multiple previous vascular surgical procedures. Two patients required second filters because of severe angulation of the filter found 1 and 4 days after implantation. Clinical thrombosis of the femoral vein after femoral vein access occurred in two (5%) of 40 patients and was proved by venogram in one. Our experience shows that the percutaneous method is highly successful and suggests that this technique should be the primary method for filter placement in the inferior vena cava.\r"

In six of these patients, emergency surgery was required to control major hemorrhage. Three patients had hypotension documented during or shortly after abdominal CT. Five patients had major intraabdominal injuries, and one patient had massive hemorrhage from facial lacerations. The severity of the blood loss was not fully appreciated clinically in five of the six patients before CT. The seventh patient had no clinical evidence of significant blood loss; in this case the flattened inferior vena cava probably was related to a normal variant. In a group of 100 patients scanned for nonacute conditions, none had flattening of the infrahepatic inferior vena cava at multiple levels. Presence of a collapsed inferior vena cava may be CT evidence of significant hypovolemia from major blood loss and should prompt careful hemodynamic and central venous pressure monitoring.\r"

Using these gene-specific probes, we performed Southern blot analyses of genomic DNAs from 11 patients and eight normal individuals. At least one allele of the B gene (the 3.7-kb TaqI fragment) in a patient was inactivated by mutations caused by recombination with the A gene. The A genes in normal individuals and patients seemed to be replaced frequently (i.e., 10/19 individuals) in their 3' portions by B gene sequences. All of these alterations occurred without changing the characteristic length (3.2 kb) of the TaqI fragment of the A gene, a result strongly suggesting that frequent gene conversions and/or intragenic recombinations have happened in the P-450(C21) genes. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms from hybridization experiments revealed extensive variation (from one to five copies) in the copy number of the A gene (the 3.2-kb TaqI fragment) whereas that of the B gene (the 3.7-kb TaqI fragment) was relatively constant at two or three copies.\r"

Multiple forms of cytochrome P-450 with different substrate specificities have been isolated. In the present paper we report the isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone for the human hepatic cytochrome P-450 responsible for mephenytoin (an anticonvulsant) oxidation. The mephenytoin cytochrome P-450 is analogous to the rat cytochrome P-450 form termed PB-1 (family P450C2C). We also report that human PB-1 is encoded by one of a small family of related genes all of which map to human chromosome 10q24.1-10q24.3. The endogenous role of this enzyme appears to be in steroid oxidations. This cytochrome P-450 family does not correspond to any of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 gene families previously mapped in humans.\r"

Preliminary large-scale restriction mapping of the fragment showed that the NotI polymorphic site is 200-370 kb distant from the MET locus; thus it defines a new polymorphic locus in the CF region.

Evaluation of genomic DNA of family members by using oligonucleotides directed toward this region demonstrated that the index case had inherited this mutation in a homozygous fashion.

  ".W": "Between January and March 1984, the first community outbreak of transient thyrotoxicosis in the United States was documented in a seven-county area of southeastern Nebraska; 36 of the total 49 patients resided in York County (2.4 cases per 1,000 population). The median age of patients was 36 years, range six to 82 years; 51 percent were women. By definition, all patients were symptomatic, visited a physician, and had a newly identified elevated serum concentration of thyroxine or triiodothyronine of unknown cause. None had a goiter or a painful thyroid gland. Low 131I uptake measurements were found in all nine patients studied. Six patients were hospitalized; none died. Investigation of all 12 household contacts of eight selected patients revealed five additional persons with thyrotoxicosis and four with asymptomatic hyperthyroxinemia. A case-control study revealed that illness was associated with a significantly higher frequency of a reported recent respiratory viral-like condition. In another case-control study, the HLA-DR3 antigen was present in more case subjects (39 percent) than control subjects (14 percent). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of patients than control subjects purchased beef from one of the three supermarkets in York Country. Concomitant with the outbreak, the supermarket implicated in the outbreak purchased an unusually large quantity of beef (7,000 pounds) from a nonregular supplier in Nebraska, which had reportedly instituted the practice of trimming gullets (a procedure that removes the muscles from bovine larynx for beef) about three months earlier. Thus, it is concluded that the Nebraska outbreak, like one in Minnesota that occurred 18 months later, probably resulted from patients having eaten ground beef that was contaminated with bovine thyroid gland. This form of thyrotoxicosis, perhaps misdiagnosed as painless thyroiditis in the past, probably represents a previously under-recognized public health problem.\r"

Herein are described five patients ultimately diagnosed as having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) in whom the differential diagnosis included SLE because of multi-system disease and autoimmune phenomena, especially positive antinuclear antibodies. Serum samples from 151 consecutive patients with AIDS or ARC were examined and 19 with low titer-positive antinuclear antibodies were found (17 at 1:20 and two at 1:160). These observations suggest that SLE and human immunodeficiency virus infection may share clinical and serologic features.\r"

The infection most commonly occurred on the fingers (69 percent) and thumb (21 percent). All 20 herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) isolates came from patients over 20 years old. All of the 13 specimens that were typed after isolation from patients under 20 years old were herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1). Only seven of the 49 adult cases were identified in health care professionals. In this series, HSV infection of the hand occurred in 2.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In adults, women with recurrent infections from HSV-2 and a history compatible with genital herpes predominated. In children, a primary HSV-1 infection associated with gingivostomatitis was common.\r"

In contrast, high doses of both interleukin 1 and 2 stimulated JEG-3 proliferation. Low doses of B cell growth factor stimulated JEG-3 proliferation, whereas the highest dose was inhibitory. Further understanding of the effects of lymphokines and monokines on trophoblastic growth may provide important insights into immunologic mechanisms affecting early pregnancy development and tumor-host interactions in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.\r"

This concept is based on in vitro studies of purified leukocyte populations because it has not been possible to assess production of these metabolites in tissues. In order to determine whether or not inflammatory cells in tissue generate H2O2, the authors modified an earlier cytochemical method for the localization of H2O2. The incubation medium consists of 0.5 mM CeCl3 in a Hepes-buffered balanced salt solution with Cl- as the only anion. Synovial tissue from the knees of normal and 16-day adjuvant arthritic rats was incubated in this medium for 30 minutes and then fixed and processed for electron microscopy. No H2O2 reaction product was visible in normal synovium. In contrast, patchy deposits of H2O2 reaction product were seen adjacent to a subpopulation of synovial lining macrophages in synovium from inflamed knee joints. These data show that rat synovial macrophages are capable of generating H2O2 when appropriately stimulated and that such a stimulus is present in adjuvant arthritis.\r"

Of 8 subjects in which virus was detected in the coronary arteries, 6 were positive for HSV and 2 for CMV; of 7 cases positive in the thoracic aorta, 5 were identified as HSV and 2 as CMV. Viral DNA and/or antigen were found in occasional cells in the intact luminal surface and in focal clusters of spindle-shaped or \"foamy\" cells in the intimal layer. The histologic findings indicate that HSV and CMV are associated with areas showing early or advanced atheromatous changes in the coronary arteries and with lesion-free as well as lesion areas in the thoracic aorta. The virologic findings support the concept that herpes-viruses may potentially play a direct or indirect role in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis.\r"

One hundred-one patients having aortocoronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery were investigated using four combinations of a narcotic and neuromuscular blocker: group FP (fentanyl 50 micrograms/kg, pancuronium 100 micrograms/kg); group FV (fentanyl 50 micrograms/kg, vecuronium 80 micrograms/kg); group SP (sufentanil 10 micrograms/kg, pancuronium 100 micrograms/kg); and group SV (sufentanil 10 micrograms/kg, vecuronium 80 micrograms/kg), each combination being administered over 2 minutes. Hemodynamic functions were then monitored for 10 minutes before tracheal intubation. Significant changes included increases in heart rate in the groups receiving pancuronium and decreases in those receiving vecuronium. In all groups mean arterial pressure initially decreased; systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly in all groups except SV. Cardiac index decreased significantly only in group SV. Circulatory depression requiring treatment with vasopressor or anticholinergic drugs was more common in patients given vecuronium. Cardiac arrhythmia occurred most often in group SP; only in group FP were there no arrhythmias, ischemic changes, or hemodynamic disturbances requiring intervention. Time to onset of neuromuscular blockade did not differ among the four groups, but transient chest wall rigidity occurred significantly more often with sufentanil than with fentanyl. Overall, the fentanyl/pancuronium combination afforded the greatest hemodynamic stability, whereas the sufentanil/vecuronium combination proved least satisfactory because of bradycardia and hypotension, requiring treatment in 35% of group SV patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of FFP to whole blood in vitro, after systemic heparinization, significantly prolonged the ACT from 451 +/- 21 seconds (mean +/- SE) to 572 +/- 41 seconds (P less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the plasma antithrombin III activity and the prolongation in ACT after systemic heparinization, with or without addition of FFP. The addition of FFP to whole blood in three of the six patients who exhibited heparin resistance (ACT less than 400 seconds after administration of 350 unit/kg heparin) did not prolong the ACT to greater than 400 seconds. These observations suggest that infusion of FFP will further prolong the ACT after heparin administration in most patients including some with initial heparin resistance.\r"

Acetylcholine and bradykinin have been shown to relax these norepinephrine contracted arteries via an endothelium-dependent process. In this study, these relaxations were reversibly and significantly attenuated by 2% halothane. However, halothane did not affect relaxations caused by nitroglycerin, which, in these vessels, acts by an endothelium independent mechanism. These results suggest that halothane is not interfering with cyclic guanylate-monophosphate mediated relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, but may interfere with the synthesis, release, or transport of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. In addition, during contractions evoked by norepinephrine, halothane caused significant decreases in tension in both the canine carotid and rabbit aortic preparations, but increased tension in the femoral artery rings. These effects were not altered by mechanical removal of the endothelium. These results suggest a direct action of halothane on the vascular smooth muscle, which can result in either an increase or decrease in tension, depending on the specific vessel. In addition to its direct vascular effect, this study suggests a new action of halothane; it interferes with endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. This action may contribute in part to the vascular alterations seen clinically during administration of halothane.\r"

After incubation with patients' serum, human IgG labeled with iodine 125 was added. The anti-IgE antibodies were partially blocked by endogenous IgE in the serum and heating the serum samples at 56 degrees C disrupted the immune complexes (ie, IgG-aIgE:IgE), thereby increasing the detectable levels of IgG anti-IgE. The specificity of anti-IgE autoantibody was confirmed by both competitive inhibition and absorption experiments, using IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and rabbit anti-human IgG. Significantly raised levels of anti-IgE autoantibody were found in patients suffering from atopic disorders in comparison to the controls. These observations may suggest that the anti-IgE autoantibody could play a certain role in the modulation of IgE-mediated immune system and the pathogenesis of atopic diseases.\r"

Specifically, this cytotoxic activity was evaluated: (1) in resting conditions and after boosting with interleukin-2 (IL-2) against NK-sensitive, NK-insensitive target cell lines, and against specific antigen-sensitized (Micropolyspora faenl) autologous monocytes; (2) after removal of NK-related populations; (3) in blocking experiments with CD3 and CD2 monoclonal antibodies. It has been demonstrated that lung lymphocytes from patients with HP in resting conditions are able to lyse both NK-susceptible and NK-resistant targets and that IL-2 is able to induce BAL cells to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity. Neither resting nor activated HP lung lymphocytes were capable of specific lysis of autologous monocytes previously sensitized with specific antigen. Removal of HNK-1+ or CD16+ cells reduces, but does not completely eliminate the cytotoxic function, whereas blocking with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody almost completely abolishes the cytotoxicity. All these data taken together suggest that different types of cytotoxic cells are recovered from the BAL of patients with HP, i.e., NK cells and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes, including LAK cells.\r"

The records of 30 patients who had a diagnosis of vascular ectasia made by colonoscopy have been retrospectively reviewed. The 30 patients included 14 men and 16 women whose median age was 70 years (range, 54 to 89 years). All patients had vascular ectasia of the cecum or ascending colon or both, five patients (16.7%) had multiple lesions, and 18 patients (60%) had associated cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, or renal disease. Of the 27 patients who presented with gastrointestinal tract bleeding, 13 (48.1%) underwent endoscopic fulguration, nine (33.3%) underwent resection, and seven (25.9%) were treated conservatively. Endoscopic fulguration was definitive treatment in 11 of the 27 patients (40.7%). A positive histologic diagnosis of vascular ectasia was made in nine of 15 patients (60%) in whom endoscopic biopsy was performed. In the hands of an experienced endoscopist, colonoscopy is a safe and effective way of diagnosing vascular ectasia and is potentially therapeutic. Endoscopic coagulation should be attempted before operation in patients with chronic anemia, limited bleeding, or concomitant severe medical disease.\r"

  ".W": "The dermatologic component of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 20,637), conducted from 1971 through 1974, documented the deleterious effect of ultraviolet radiation on selected skin and eye conditions. Actinic skin damage was more frequent in white men with high as compared with low sunlight exposure, 36.7% vs 23.3%, respectively. Among white women, the corresponding figures were 34.1% vs 18.6%, respectively. Actinic damage was found more often in individuals with light eye color. Basal cell epitheliomas were found in 11.3% of white men aged 65 to 74 years who had severely actinic-damaged skin as compared with 1.0% of those with undamaged skin. Sunlight exposure was positively associated with localized hypomelanism, localized hypermelanism, seborrheic keratoses, senile lentigines, freckles, acne rosacea, spider nevi, varicose veins, venus star, dry skin, wrinkled skin, pterygia, arcus senilis, and a variety of minor oral lesions of the tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa. These findings suggest that a large number of dermatologic conditions, which may in part result from overexposure to sunlight, may be preventable.\r"

In the past year, we treated 4 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. All of them were treated with closed tube thoracostomy, and 1 patient with bilateral apical cysts eventually required bilateral thoracotomies and pleurectomies. Only 1 patient had an uncomplicated hospital course. The remaining patients had prolonged air leaks, and 2 had synchronous pneumothoraces. Pneumothorax appears to be associated with P. carinii pneumonia. We recommend closed tube thoracostomy as the initial treatment in symptomatic patients. Pleurectomy for air leaks persisting longer than seven days can be safely performed in patients fit for thoractomy.\r"

In Group 2, a second dose of 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously shortly before cannulation. Serum and tissue levels in the right atrium, the pericardium, and the sternum were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The results showed that in Group 2 the serum levels were significantly higher from 48 minutes onward after induction and remained at an acceptable level during CABG. The tissue levels in the sternum and pericardium were also significantly higher in Group 2 compared with Group 1. It is concluded that a second dose of cefamandole (15 mg/kg) shortly before the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass is recommended, particularly for high-risk patients.\r"

The left IMA pedicle was prepared in routine fashion from the level of the first rib superiorly to just distal to the IMA bifurcation. Following cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass but before institution of extracorporeal circulation, the IMA was divided 5 mm proximal to its bifurcation and allowed to bleed freely. The flow from each end was then measured by allowing the segment to bleed for 30 seconds. The mean antegrade flow was 73 +/- 34 ml/min, and the retrograde flow was 25 +/- 17.2 ml/min. The difference between the flows was significant (p less than 0.05). Based on these data we do not recommend the retrograde IMA technique as a primary form of revascularization of the myocardium. In selected circumstances it may be used if adequate retrograde flow is demonstrated before constructing the anastomosis.\r"

In addition, aspirin users had significantly increased requirements for postoperative packed red blood cells (4.4 +/- 3.5 versus 1.8 +/- 1.3 units; p = 0.014), platelets (1.3 +/- 1.3 versus 0.2 +/- 0.4 six-donor units, p = 0.0049), and fresh-frozen plasma (3.6 +/- 5.0 versus 0.78 +/- 1.6 units; p = 0.042) transfusions. The only patients requiring reoperation for bleeding were in the aspirin-treated group (2 patients). Six patients were not entered into the randomized part of the study because of excessively prolonged post-aspirin bleeding times (greater than 10 minutes). This finding suggests that a subset of patients are particularly sensitive to aspirin and have significantly prolonged bleeding times after aspirin ingestion. We conclude that aspirin ingestion increases postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements, and we recommend discontinuation of aspirin therapy before cardiac procedures.\r"

We used the same questionnaire to survey the house staffs of four other programs varying in geography and exposure to patients with AIDS. We found a striking correlation between the number of patients with AIDS cared for by the residents, the assessment of the prognosis of patients with AIDS with P carinii pneumonia, and house-staff attitudes toward discussions about resuscitation and intensive care. The results of this study suggest that the intensity of exposure to patients with AIDS determines the assessment of prognosis, and that one or both of these factors strongly influences attitudes toward intensive care. Regardless of these attitudes, early discussion of resuscitation and intensive care between physicians and patients with AIDS and P carinii pneumonia seems warranted.\r"

Excluding tobacco use disorder and psychosexual dysfunction, 38 diabetic subjects (51%) received one or more psychiatric diagnoses. The lifetime prevalence of major depression was comparable for female (11 of 48 [22.9%]) and male (seven of 27 [25.9%]) diabetics; both rates were significantly higher than rates in first-degree relatives and the general population. Among female diabetics, the six-month and lifetime prevalences of simple phobia were increased vs donors and the general population; among male diabetics, the lifetime prevalence of antisocial personality disorder was greater than that in the general population. None of these disorders was found to be related to the duration of diabetes or the presence of various complications. The data suggest that increased rates of psychiatric disorder in type I diabetics have both gender-independent and gender-related components.\r"

Receptor occupancy in drug-treated patients was defined as the percent reduction of specific carbon 11-raclopride binding in relation to the expected binding in the absence of drug treatment. Clinical treatment of schizophrenic patients with 11 chemically distinct antipsychotic drugs (including both classic and atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine) resulted in a 65% to 85% occupancy of D2-dopamine receptors. In a depressed patient treated with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline, no occupancy was found. The time course for receptor occupancy and drug levels was followed after withdrawal of sulpiride or haloperidol. D2-dopamine receptor occupancy remained above 65% for many hours despite a substantial reduction of serum drug concentrations. In a sulpiride-treated patient, the dosage was reduced in four steps over a nine-week period and a curvilinear relationship was demonstrated between central D2-dopamine receptor occupancy and serum drug concentrations. The results demonstrate that clinical doses of all the currently used classes of antipsychotic drugs cause a substantial blockade of central D2-dopamine receptors in humans. This effect appears to be selective for the antipsychotics, since it was not induced by the antidepressant nortriptyline.\r"

  ".W": "Human leukocyte antigen typing is currently being done by both serologic and cellular techniques. It is this methodology that forms the basis for organ transplantation, since HLA antigens are the major proteins involved in graft rejection. Matching organ graft donors with recipients at these polymorphic HLA loci clearly increases graft survival in most transplant systems. However, the serologic and cellular techniques have shortcomings, including the problem of standardizing antisera, the need for technologists with expertise in T-cell cloning, and the failure to work successfully with some cells (eg, leukemic blasts). We have begun to develop a more rapid, sensitive typing method using molecular biological techniques to tissue-type cells. Using oligonucleotide probes, we can now identify HLA-D region alleles (which may differ by only a single nucleotide) that can only be differentiated by a highly technical, lengthy cellular technique. Oligonucleotide probing not only provides the basis for a rapid method of HLA typing, which in all likelihood will become generally applicable as additional sequence information becomes available, but also allows definition of a gene transcript from an individual locus rather than the phenotypic results provided by current HLA typing techniques.\r"

The initial biopsy specimens revealed multifocal clusters of large blastic lymphoid cells, with some clusters showing a monoclonal lambda light chain predominance, whereas other clusters showed a kappa predominance, indicating considerable phenotypic ambiguity suggestive of polyclonality. This initial clonal ambiguity was followed within two to three months by overt histologic, phenotypic, and clinical malignant transformation to a diffuse high-grade monoclonal B-cell lymphoma. These data have significant implications for the clonality and pathogenesis of AIDS-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. AIDS-related lymphomas may evolve from an initial multiclonal B-cell expansion similar to that described in other severely immunosuppressed patients (eg, with posttransplantation lymphoma).\r"

Immunohistochemistry, using a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies, revealed a marked hyperplasia of dendritic reticulum cells in the nodular aggregates, and showed the atypical lymphoid cells to belong to the helper/inducer T-cell subset. The T-lineage of this nodular lymphoma was confirmed by demonstration of a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain genes. It is concluded that a nodular growth pattern caused by hyperplasia of follicular dendritic reticulum cells may occasionally be found in malignant lymphoma of the peripheral T-cell type.\r"

Although these results remain insufficient to find any conclusions concerning the nature of Reed-Sternberg cells and Hodgkin's cells, Leu-3a reactivity may represent the aberrant form of T-cell phenotype. Alternatively, we suggest that Reed-Sternberg cells and Hodgkin's cells may be derived from monocyte-macrophage lineage because normal and neoplastic cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage express Pan-T antigen-/HLA-DR+/Leu-3a+/OKT6- phenotype.\r"

Usually, an autoantibody to von Willebrand factor can be identified. These patients often experience severe hemorrhages requiring large doses of cryoprecipitate or factor VIII concentrates, thus exposing them to viral and allergic complications. The success of intravenous gamma-globulin in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases prompted us to treat two patients with acquired von Willebrand syndrome with high-dose intravenous gamma-globulin. Two days after initiation of therapy, von Willebrand factor and factor VIII rose to normal levels in both patients. Patient 1 underwent dental surgery, and patient 2 underwent a splenectomy without increased bleeding and without additional factor coverage or desmopressin acetate therapy. Thus, intravenous gamma-globulin is efficacious for acquired von Willebrand syndrome and obviates the need for replacement therapy with its attendant complications.\r"

Myelin-associated glycoprotein (Leu-7), myelin basic-protein (MBP), S100-protein, and, in most cases, glial-fibrillary acidic-protein (GFAP) and HLA-DR/Ia (LN3) immunoreactivity were evaluated immunohistochemically using commercially available antibodies on 53 benign nerve sheath tumors and 12 sarcomas. Leu-7 immunoreactivity was detected by a monoclonal antibody in 12 of 16 schwannomas, 12 of 20 neurofibromas, and 17 of 17 traumatic neuromas. No Leu-7 positivity was seen in the sarcomas. Distinct heavy MBP immunoreactivity, assessed using polyclonal antibodies, was identified only in all 17 traumatic neuromas. Extensive S100-protein positivity was seen in 15 of 16 schwannomas, 17 of 20 neurofibromas, and 17 of 17 traumatic neuromas. Extensive LN3 immunoreactivity was seen in Schwann cells of 50% of the nerve sheath tumors analyzed; however, it was also present in associated interdigitating reticulum cells; GFAP immunoreactivity was not detected. These data suggest that Leu-7 is an important marker of Schwann cell neoplasms, although it is not superior to S100 protein. Moreover, combined immunohistochemical evaluation of potential Schwann cell markers including Leu-7, MBP, GFAP, and LN3 using commercially available antibodies offers no advantage over analysis of S100-protein immunoreactivity alone.\r"

  ".W": "Intramural duodenal hematoma in children is one of the least common injuries encountered. Because of the rarity of this problem, there has been little conformity of opinion as to the relative merits of operative vs nonoperative management. We reviewed 182 cases of this condition, of which 168 were taken from the English literature and 14 from our hospital. Pancreatitis was the most common associated intra-abdominal lesion (21%), while central nervous system, skeletal, and thoracic injuries (5%) accounted for the major extra-abdominal injuries. Hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura occurred in 7 cases and played a major role in the prognosis. Of these cases, 121 patients were treated surgically and 61 conservatively. The average hospitalization was 14 days for the surgical group and 11 days for the conservative group. There were 18 complications in the surgical group. It appears that most patients with intramural duodenal hematoma would respond well to conservative management. Surgery should be reserved for those cases that remain obstructed over seven to ten days or have evidence of perforation.\r"

Because changes in brain glucose metabolism may precede gross functional or morphologic alterations, we recently applied the technique of positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 in an exploratory study to compare six patients with sickle cell disease without prior neurologic abnormalities (and with normal cranial computed tomographic scans) with six healthy age-matched controls, with respect to overall and regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose. We found no significant difference in the global metabolic rates for the two groups. However, we observed an unusual clustering of abnormal regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the frontal lobes of these subjects. These results support previous observations that frontal lobe involvement may be quite prevalent in sickle cell disease, even among individuals with normal computed tomographic scans.\r"

All patients breathed room air spontaneously. Unconsciousness was successfully induced in all patients and persisted during the 60 min of the infusion. Statistically significant decreases in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were observed 2 min after induction (28% and 19%, respectively) and during infusion (30% and 25%, respectively) and were related to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (21% following induction and 30% during infusion). Cardiac output was not affected at any time nor were stroke volume and heart rate. We conclude that the arterial hypotension associated with the induction and infusion of propofol is mainly a result of a decrease in afterload without compensatory increases in heart rate or cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus II (HTLV-II) from a second patient (N.R.A.) with atypical hairy cell leukemia. Follow-up analysis of the characteristics of the patient's HTLV-II infection over a 2-year period has revealed that the patient had two coexistant lymphoproliferative disorders. Oligoclonally integrated HTLV-II was detected in DNA extracted from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells on separate occasions greater than 1 year apart, similar to integration of HTLV-I seen in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. Although integrated provirus was readily detected, no HTLV-II viral RNA expression was seen in fresh peripheral blood lymphoid cells. Although the patient's peripheral blood consistently contained a majority of atypical lymphoid cells with a T cell antigenic phenotype, he ultimately developed extensive pleural, hepatic and soft tissue infiltration with malignant Tac+, tartrate-resistant, acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) B cells of clonal origin. To further characterize the role of HTLV-II, the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells were fractionated into four enriched subpopulations at autopsy. Oligoclonally integrated HTLV-II was detected in DNA from a T cell-enriched fraction and a CD8+ T cell-enriched fraction, but not in a CD4+ T cell-enriched fraction, a non-T cell fraction, or in B cells obtained from the malignant pleural effusion. We conclude that the patient harbored two distinct lymphoproliferative disorders, a TRAP+, Tac+ B cell malignancy consistent with hairy cell leukemia that did not contain HTLV-II and a Tac-, CD8+ lymphoproliferative syndrome with oligoclonally integrated HTLV-II.\r"

  ".W": "The cell cycle transition and differentiation-associated surface antigen expression was studied in a clone of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with phenotypic properties similar to those of resting B lymphocytes. Differentiation was induced with TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) and defined and quantitated by morphological and functional markers. Changes in the cell cycle position were determined by flow cytometry of acridine orange-stained cells. The uninduced B-CLL cells represented a homogeneous population with the same cell cycle position (GO) as resting normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. After five days of TPA stimulation, 56% of the B-CLL cells were found in G1A, 9% in G1B, and 3% in the S + G2/M phase, of which 2% was accounted to proliferating T cells. The cell cycle transition of the differentiating B-CLL cells was also examined using cell cycle-associated surface antigens as markers. HLA-DR and CD23 antigens were present already on noninduced cells. The former had a high constant expression, while the amount of CD23 increased upon induction. The 4F2 antigen was absent on noninduced cells but present on 86% of the induced cells. HH1 (CD37) was expressed by the majority of the cells before TPA treatment and decreased to almost undetectable levels within 24 hours. Two antigens related to late stages of the cell cycle, the interleukin 2 (IL 2; CD25) and the transferrin receptor, were present on about 20% of the induced cells. Experiments with enriched T cells showed that T but not B cells incorporated 3H-thymidine. Taken together these results and previous work on the induction of the protooncogene c-myc and c-fos suggest that this B-CLL clone represents GO cells that undergo differentiation without concomitant proliferation when exposed to TPA.\r"

  ".W": "The Corfu delta beta zero thalassemia is characterized by the clinical picture of thalassemia intermedia. In the homozygous state there is a complete absence of hemoglobin (Hb) A and Hb A2 and a high level of Hb F. A DNA fragment containing the gamma and beta globin genes has been cosmid cloned, and the deletion breakpoint region, the beta globin gene and the promoter regions of the gamma globin genes sequenced. The deletion removes 7,201 base pairs (bp) containing part of the delta globin gene and sequences upstream. The beta globin gene contains a G----A mutation at IVS 1 position 5. The gamma globin gene promoters are normal. Analysis of the transcription of the mutated beta globin gene in transfected HeLa cells shows that normal message is produced at a level of approximately 20% compared with a normal gene, the remaining 80% being spliced at cryptic sites in exon 1 and intron 1. This indicates that the mutation in the beta globin gene is not the sole cause of the absence of Hb A in Corfu delta beta zero thalassemia. It is concluded that the 7.2 kilobase (kb) of deleted DNA contains sequences necessary for the normal activation of the beta globin gene. Possible mechanisms for the effect of the deletion on the expression of beta and gamma globin genes are discussed.\r"

In one family a novel -alpha 3.5 deletion removing the alpha 1 globin gene with some of its flanking sequences has been found, suggesting further sequence homology of the alpha globin gene cluster 3' to the alpha 1 globin gene. Patients with sickle cell disease and alpha thalassemia had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels, RBC counts, and Hb A2 levels, and lower reticulocyte counts, MCV, MCH, and Hb F levels than those with a normal alpha genotype. The frequency of splenomegaly was not influenced by the alpha globin genotype. A higher prevalence of alpha thalassemia was found in patients greater than or equal to 10 years of age than in the younger group, suggesting a possible advantageous effect of alpha thalassemia on the survival of patients with sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".U": "88108162\r", 
  ".W": "By analyzing surface antigens and cytolytic functions of proliferating large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), three types of T cell LGL lymphocytosis were delineated. The first, most commonly encountered type exhibited CD3+4-8+16+, WT31+ phenotype, low or undetectable non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity, and moderate to strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC). Because these LGLs carried T cell antigen receptor (Ti) recognized by WT31 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), and treatment with anti-Ti, anti-CD3 MoAbs and phytohemagglutinin elicited non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, they may have developed from populations of in vivo primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes with unknown antigen specificity. The second, rare type of LGL lymphocytosis exhibited CD3+4-8-16+, WT31 phenotype, and strong non-MHC-restricted, ADCC and LDCC cytotoxicities. These cells were probably derived from the lymphocytes of the same phenotype found in small numbers in normal peripheral blood. Because anti-CD3 MoAb inhibited non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity of the LGLs, a Ti not detected by WT31 MoAb, but putatively present seemed to serve as a specific receptor for target tumor cell recognition. The third type of LGL lymphocytosis showed CD3+4+8-16+, WT31+ phenotype, and lacked cytolytic activities and parallel tubular arrays. These LGLs probably evolved from cells with the same characteristics selectively located in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Taken together, in patients with LGL lymphocytosis, T cell-associated antigens expressed on LGLs were shown to be involved in the regulation of LGL-mediated cytolytic activities. In addition, studies of surface antigens and the effects of MoAbs and lectins on cytolytic activities may be useful in clarifying the normal counterpart of LGLs from which leukemic or reactively proliferating LGLs originate.\r"

The proliferation status of each of these maturational stages was determined by simultaneous quantitative DNA analysis on a flow cytometer. The technique used to quantify these parameters preserved the cell surface immunofluorescence, the light scattering properties and the stoichiometric binding to DNA. The proliferating cells were confined to a distinct population of cells expressing CD10. The number of proliferating cells in these populations was relatively constant among 12 separate bone marrow samples. The data suggest that the timing and rate of proliferation of cells within a single lineage may be a preprogrammed aspect of normal maturation.\r"

Sephadex G 150 chromatography revealed that the chondrocyte-stimulating activity was molecularly heterogeneous, with apparent molecular ratios of 16,000-21,000 (16-21K), 45-50K, 80-90K, and more than 100K. The IL-1 activity, as estimated by a murine thymocyte activation assay, co-eluted with the 16-21K chondrocyte-stimulating peak, indicating that IL-1 might stimulate the DNA synthesis of chondrocytes in vitro. This assumption was verified in experiments demonstrating a dose-dependent stimulation of chondrocyte DNA synthesis by recombinant human IL-1 alpha. CM from resting and proliferating chondrocytes lacked detectable IL-1 activity, speaking against an autocrine role of IL-1 in epiphyseal cartilage growth. The results suggest that IL-1, in addition to its other effects in inflammatory responses, also acts as a chondrocyte growth factor. This might be one mechanism behind the reactive formation of cartilage in inflamed joints and the increased longitudinal bone growth often seen in affected limbs of children with arthritis.\r"

Of the ten patients with recurrent varices, eight (including the two who bled acutely in the postoperative period) successfully underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy. Postoperative endoscopy was performed at 5-monthly intervals.

Detailed immunophenotyping of ten patients showed that seven patients (73%) had an activated \"novel\" T-cell phenotype, indicative of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTL). Additionally, six of these seven PTL patients had T-helper (Leu-3) antigen expression to the exclusion of T-suppressor (Leu-2) expression. Three patients, in complete contrast, had a B-cell lymphoma with monoclonal immunoglobulin expression. The B-cell MLEH were morphologically indistinguishable from T-cell MLEH. Clinically, the initial diagnosis proved difficult; ten of the 11 patients were initially misdiagnosed, most often as another lymphoid disorder or as granulomatous disease (mean delay of 10 months in diagnosis from onset of symptoms). The median survival of all patients was 20 months (1 to 45+ months) with two apparent subgroups: those who had rapid progression of disease with a median survival of 5 months, all of T-cell phenotype; and a small group whose median survival has not yet been reached, all of B-cell phenotype. Our results suggest that the immunophenotype, B-cell versus T-cell, may be a major predictor of survival, with B-cell MLEH patients having a longer survival than those of T-cell type.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells have been involved in immunosurveillance against tumors. A normal NK activity was observed in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) from women with breast cancer, but a very low or absent NK cytotoxicity was found in the regional lymph node (RLN) MNC. However, strong cytotoxic activity against NK-resistant and NK-sensitive target cells can be induced in RLN MNC by long-term (5-day) incubation with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). This cytotoxic inducer effect of rIL-2, not observed with recombinant interferon gamma, was dose and time-dependent and was not associated with modifications in the low number of Leu 11+ or Leu 7+ cells present in the population. Both the lack of NK activity and the generation of rIL-2-activated killer cells can be readily demonstrated in either histologically affected or unaffected RLN. These results stress the value of the immunomodulators inducing cytotoxic activity in RLN MNC of patients with tumors, and are discussed in association with their possible therapeutical role.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) were analyzed according to age, sex, and tumor stage. In addition, the MTC were screened for the predominant histologic pattern, immunocytochemical spectrum (60 tumors), and DNA content (DNA cytophotometry and DNA flow cytometry, 25 tumors). These findings were correlated with follow-up data available for 45 of these patients. Forty-eight percent of the tumors revealed a polygonal cell pattern, whereas 22% showed spindle-cell predominance. All tumors contained cytokeratin, chromogranin A, and calcitonin (CT). Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was present in 92%, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 77%, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in 75%, and vimentin in 53% of cases. Positivity for neurotensin, somatostatin, neurofilaments, bombesin, and alpha human chorionic gonadotropin (a-hCG) and serotonin ranged between 3% and 27%. All MTC were negative for substance P, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroglobulin (TG), or S-100 protein. Local recurrences and regional lymph node metastases revealed identical staining patterns as the primaries. Prognosis of MTC was found not to be related to histologic features (dominant architectural pattern, cellular shape, presence of amyloid deposits) or immunocytochemical pattern. Instead, survival was significantly correlated to age, sex, and stage of disease. The best prognosis was seen in women younger than 40 years and revealing an early stage of disease. DNA measurements added valuable information in assessing the prognosis of MTC.\r"

The rats then were divided into two groups; 50% were kept as a control group while the other 50% received single injections of 1 mCi yttrium 90 (90Y) microspheres directly into the center of the tumor. This study shows a significant reduction of the tumor growth rate in treated animals. Tumor sizes after 4 days averaged 1.31 ml in the treated rats and 9.74 ml in the control group. Excluding animals that had complete regression of the tumor, treated rats lived an average of 30.8 days from the day of treatment compared with the control rats, which lived an average of 17.4 days. Pathology examinations showed no effects from injected radioactive materials in the liver, bone marrow or the kidney. Examination of the injected area after 6 months showed that microspheres remained locally and that the tumor was replaced with collagen tissue.\r"

  ".U": "88109859\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of sympathomimetic amines on Ca2+ transients and isometric contractions were assessed in isolated rabbit papillary muscles in which multiple superficial cells had been microinjected with the calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin. In the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the alpha-receptor agonist phenylephrine increased both the amplitude of the aequorin signals and the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the maximum increase in the aequorin signals was less than 10% of that produced by the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol, while the maximum increase in force of contraction produced by alpha-stimulation was about 50% of that elicited via beta-adrenoceptors. For a given increase in the force of contraction, stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors produced much less change in the amplitude of the aequorin signals than did elevation of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration; we interpret this to mean that the positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation is in large part the result of an increase in myofibrillar sensitivity to Ca2+. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors produced little change or a slight decrease in the duration of the aequorin signal and an increase in the duration of contraction, while stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors significantly decreased the time to peak and duration of both the aequorin signals and the contractions. For a given level of inotropic effect, high concentrations of isoproterenol often increased the aequorin signals more than did elevations of Ca2+, which is consistent with other evidence that the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of troponin I leads to a decrease in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity. However, concentrations of isoproterenol that did not produce evidence of this sort of desensitization also abbreviated the contractions much more than they did the aequorin signals. This suggests that the traditionally accepted mechanisms--a decrease in the Ca2+ affinity of troponin C and an acceleration of Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum--may not be sufficient to account for the actions of beta-receptor stimulation on the time course of contraction. In the absence of blocking agents, the naturally occurring catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine appear to influence the function of the rabbit papillary muscle through both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Dopamine has a relatively greater effect on alpha-adrenoceptors than the other catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a method for quantifying the uptake, redistribution, and washout of thallium-201 (201Tl) obtained with rotational tomography. This method generates maximum count circumferential profiles of the short-axis slices of the left ventricle, translates them into polar coordinate profiles, and displays them as a bullseye plot, which consists of a series of concentric circles with the apex at the center and the base at the periphery. Normal limits were established for the distribution of 201Tl in 36 patients with a low (less than 5%) probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-five patients who had undergone coronary angiography were used as a pilot group to define criteria for the identification and localization of perfusion defects. The best agreement with the results of angiography was found when abnormal regions of the bullseye were defined as contiguous defects over 2.5 SDs below normal. These criteria were applied prospectively to 210 points (179 points with greater than 50% diameter stenosis and 31 with less than 50%). Visual, quantitative, and combined visual and quantitative analysis were compared for overall detection of disease and for detection of individual vessel involvement. The overall sensitivity for detection of disease by these methods was 97%, 95%, and 95%, respectively. The specificities were 68%, 74%, and 71% respectively. The sensitivity for detection of individual vessel involvement with the bullseye alone was 78% for the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 89% for the right coronary artery (RCA), and 65% for the left circumflex (LCx). For visual analysis, the results were 70%, 88%, and 50%, respectively, while the use of visual and quantitative analysis combined identified 75% of LAD, 87% of RCA, and 55% of LCx lesions. We conclude that quantitative analysis of rotational 201Tl tomographic images is a highly accurate technique for determining the presence and location of CAD.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II elicits contractile responses in the coronary arteries and myocardial tissue, which suggests that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by specific agents should lead to both coronary vasodilation and an alteration of left ventricular inotropism. The present work was designed to delineate--independently from its systemic effects--the intrinsic actions of an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor on the coronary circulation and left ventricular function. To minimize peripheral effects, a bilateral intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat (0.05 mg.min-1, 1 ml.min-1 in each coronary artery) was performed in 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients had normal coronary arteriograms. In 12 patients (group I) the intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat resulted in minimal peripheral changes, with a 5% reduction in the mean aortic pressure (p less than .05) and no significant alteration in indexes of preload, i.e., left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume, or of afterload, i.e., left ventricular end-systolic stress and systemic resistances. Myocardial oxygen consumption was also unaffected by the intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat. Coronary vasodilation was demonstrated by a significant elevation of coronary sinus blood flow (+19%, from 181 +/- 73 to 214 +/- 79 ml.min-1, p less than .001) and a reduction of coronary resistance (-18%, from 0.51 +/- 0.17 to 0.41 +/- 0.15 mm Hg.ml-1.min, p less than .001), with a parallel increase in coronary sinus oxygen content and pressure (both p less than .05). Oxygen extraction by the myocardium was reduced (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A diagnosis was established exclusively by endoscopy in 80 percent of the patients. Twenty-eight patients were treated by endoscopic coagulation; bleeding stopped after one or more treatments in 67.9 percent of these patients. There were no complications or mortality as a consequence of endoscopic treatment. Surgery controlled the recurrent bleeding in six of seven cases of failed endoscopic coagulation, and in 13 of 17 cases where surgery only was undertaken, for an overall success rate 79.2 percent. It is concluded that colonoscopy can accurately establish the diagnosis of colonic AVMs in chronic lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic coagulation is a useful adjunct in the treatment of this condition, and is safe, effective, and leaves other options open.\r"

Fourteen healthy volunteers completed a checklist of gastrointestinal symptoms, underwent endoscopy and biopsy of the stomach and duodenum, and supplied a fresh stool sample for Hemoccult and HemoQuant testing. They then took ferrous sulfate 325 mg per os tid for two weeks and had the same evaluation repeated. Gastrointestinal symptoms were rated by the patients on a scale of 0-3, endoscopic findings were numerically scored (0-4), and the biopsies were graded blindly. Thirteen other healthy volunteers took ferrous sulfate 325 mg per os tid for one week and had Hemoccult testing of stool at days 0 and 7. All subjects developed dark stools, and significant nausea and diarrhea were noted (0.1 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.05 for both symptoms). Only 1/27 had a questionably trace-positive Hemoccult test (two observers disagreed) and no significant difference was seen in HemoQuant testing (1.4 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg Hb/g). A significant increase was seen in endoscopic abnormalities in the stomach (0.1 +/- 0.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.3, P = 0.003), consisting of erythema, small areas of subepithelial hemorrhage, and, in two subjects, erosions. Biopsies showed no significant change after iron therapy. We conclude that (1) oral ferrous sulfate rarely causes Hemoccult-positive stools, and patients with positive Hemoccult tests on iron therapy require further evaluation; and (2) oral iron may cause mild endoscopic abnormalities in the stomach which are of uncertain clinical significance.\r"

The crude hypertension prevalence was 56.8% for women and 33.99% for men, with an overall crude prevalence of 47.2%. No hypertensive patients were identified among diabetic patients less than 15 yr old, and most hypertensive diabetic patients were greater than 70 yr old. Hypertension prevalence in diabetic individuals demonstrated a highly significant trend with age (P less than .01). Compared with the general population, diabetic individuals had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (P less than .01), largely explained by the higher prevalence in women. Variables known to be associated with hypertension risk in the general population were also significantly associated with hypertension among diabetic individuals. Older age, being female, and increased body mass index were strongly associated with hypertension in this study population. Diabetic individuals with hypertension were six times more likely to have renal disease than those without hypertension. The level of blood glucose control, diabetes treatment (i.e., insulin or oral hypoglycemics versus diet), and diabetes duration were not associated with hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that ACTH secretion in response to selected stimuli may be modulated by angiotensin II (AII) via direct action at the level of the corticotrope or through central actions to facilitate CRF secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation. These hypotheses were evaluated in the present series of experiments. Our failure to observe a significant portal to peripheral plasma immunoreactive (ir) AII gradient suggested that AII does not act as a physiologically significant ACTH secretagogue at the level of the corticotrope. Central administration of synthetic AII evoked a modest dose-related stimulation of hypothalamic irCRF secretion into the portal circulation, which was reversed by the AII receptor antagonist saralasin. Activation of a known AII-positive neuronal pathway projecting from the subfornical organ (SFO) to the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei resulted in an elevation of hypophysial-portal plasma irCRF levels and increased circulating ACTH. Pretreatment with saralasin prevented SFO stimulation-induced irCRF secretion. These observations suggest that central AII-containing pathways may participate in mediation of ACTH secretion in response to hypovolemia or hyperosmolality by facilitating irCRF secretion. Involvement of the SFO, a circumventricular organ, in this circuit is intriguing as it provides a means of monitoring peripheral irAII concentration and then converting this humoral signal into a neural signal distributed to regions regulating drinking behavior, neurohypophysial AVP secretion, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

  ".W": "The radioligand [125I-Tyro]ovine CRF [( 125I] oCRF) was used to identify, characterize, and localize CRF receptors in a crude homogenate of mouse spleen. The binding was linear with increasing membrane protein concentration, saturable, and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis of [125I]oCRF saturation curves revealed a high affinity component with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.26 nM and a maximum receptor concentration of 8.74 fmol/mg protein. The relative affinities of various CRF-related and unrelated peptides at the [125I]oCRF-binding site in spleen correlate well with their reported potencies in eliciting ACTH release from the pituitary and their relative affinities for CRF receptors in brain. Consistent with a coupling of splenic CRF receptors to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, the binding of [125I]oCRF was increased by magnesium ions and decreased by guanine nucleotides in both mouse spleen and brain. Saturation analysis of [125I]oCRF binding at 0, 1, and 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgCl2 plus 200 microM GTP, and 10 mM MgCl2 plus 50 microM 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate indicated that high affinity [125I]oCRF binding in both brain and spleen requires Mg2+; however, subtle differences were observed in the degree of sensitivity and mechanisms by which Mg2+ and guanine nucleotides regulated specific binding of [125I]oCRF to brain and spleen. Autoradiographic studies indicated that [125I]oCRF-binding sites were primarily localized to the red pulp and marginal zone regions of the spleen, which are known to contain high concentrations of macrophages. The absence of [125I]oCRF-binding sites in the periarteriolar and peripheral follicular white pulp regions suggests that neither T nor B lymphocytes have specific CRF-binding sites. In summary, we have identified a high affinity, magnesium-dependent, and guanine nucleotide-sensitive binding site for CRF in mouse spleen which appears to be localized primarily in splenic macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ketoconazole (KC) on secretion and biosynthesis of ACTH and generation of cAMP in rat anterior pituitary cells were investigated in vitro. KC inhibits CRF-stimulated ACTH release from rat anterior pituitary fragments in a dose-dependent fashion between 1.5 and 100 microM. The effect of CRF as a releaser of ACTH was fully restored after KC was removed from the medium. Similar effects were observed in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. KC dose-dependently decreased basal and CRF-stimulated ACTH release. In addition, basal and CRF-stimulated mRNA coding for the ACTH precursor were reduced after preincubation with KC. The effects of KC on ACTH release and biosynthesis seem to be mediated by cAMP, since KC inhibits basal and CRF-stimulated cAMP release and content within the same dose range. Since the stimulatory effects of cholera toxin, sodium fluoride, and forskolin were dose-dependently inhibited by KC and since the addition of (Bu)2cAMP abolished the inhibiting effect of KC, it is concluded that KC acts by inhibition of the catalytic component of the adenylate cyclase holoenzyme.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the importance of estrogen in osteoporosis, the effects of decreased estrogen production using sensitive measurements of bone mineral metabolism were studied in oophorectomized rats. Serum levels of ionized calcium, bone gla protein (BGP), vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), and estradiol were measured before and serially for 6 weeks after oophorectomy in the rat. In addition, static and dynamic indices of bone histomorphometry were determined after double tetracycline labeling. Fifty Sprague-Dawley female rats (approximately 250 g) were studied. Twenty-five rats underwent oophorectomy (O), while the remaining rats were sham operated. Estrogen deficiency was noted in the O group within a week after surgery (estradiol, 2.45 +/- 0.78 vs. 27.9 +/- 4.15 pg/ml; P less than 0.05). Serum ionized calcium levels, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and PTH levels did not differ between the two groups during the length of the study. Serum BGP levels were the same in both groups until the second week postoophorectomy, after which BGP remained significantly elevated in the O animals (121.7 +/- 5.95 vs. 76.7 +/- 3.87; P less than 0.001). Bone histomorphometry revealed increased osteoid volume (4.4 +/- 0.9% vs. 2.3 +/- 0.7%), osteoblast surface (26.5 +/- 2.4% vs. 3.2 +/- 1.2%), tetracycline surface (18.9 +/- 4.1% vs. 6.8 +/- 2.2%), as well as osteoclast surface (8.2 +/- 1.4% vs. 2.5 +/- 2%) in all O animals compared with those in the sham-operated group. These data indicate that oophorectomy and decreased estrogen result in increased bone turnover with elevated BGP levels. The marked BGP elevation within 2 weeks postoophorectomy suggests that estrogen withdrawal results in rapid altered bone mineral metabolism. The lack of concomitant increase in circulating PTH levels suggests that other factors may be mediating the bone loss following surgical oophorectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Generation of T3 from T4 in vivo cannot be demonstrated in tadpoles until just before metamorphic climax (MC). Possible explanations include the absence of the necessary 5'-monodeiodinase (5'D) process, and/or the presence of an active T3 and T4 5-deiodinase (5D) system before MC. In the present study, 5'D activity was determined in the 12,000 x g supernatent fraction of tissue homogenates prepared from tadpoles in premetamorphosis (PM) and MC (induced by immersion in 2 x 10(-8) M T4) by measuring the 125I-formed from [125I] rT3 or [125I]T4 in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol. Eadie-Hofstee plots of data were used to determine maximum velocity and Km. During PM, 5'D activity was undetectable in liver, tail, heart, and kidney, minimal in brain and gut, and could be quantitated only in skin. During MC, 5'D activity was undetectable in liver, heart, and kidney, but was present in tail tissue and was increased more than 5-fold in skin and gut. The increased activity was due to a change in maximum velocity, with no change in Km. In its properties, the tadpole 5'D system was comparable to the type II system found in some mammalian tissues. Thus, it exhibited Km values for T4 and rT3 in the nanomolar range, the preferred substrate was T4, and activity was unaffected by propylthiouracil in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol. Under comparable incubation conditions, T3 5D activity was detected in most tissues during PM; the highest activity was found in liver, gut, and kidney. 5D activity was barely detectable in MC. From these studies it is suggested that accumulation of T3 generated from T4 in the tadpole is minimal before MD due to the predominance of 5D activity. During MC, accumulation of T3 is possible because of the substantial increase in 5'D activity together with a marked drop in 5D activity. The principle T3-generating organs appear to be gut, skin, and tail tissue.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the site (brain and/or pituitary) at which corticosterone (Cort) acts to inhibit adrenalectomy-induced ACTH secretion, the following experiments were performed in male rats. Rats in which brain and pituitary feedback sites were to be left intact were subjected to sham hypothalamic lesions. Rats in which only pituitary sites were to be left were subjected to either medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) or para-ventricular nuclei (PVN) lesions. Two days later all rats were adrenalectomized and replaced with varying amounts of Cort (by sc pellet). Lesioned rats also received sc pumps that delivered 0-5 micrograms/day rat CRF. All rats were killed 5 days after adrenalectomy. Sham-lesioned groups exhibited the expected dose-related inhibition of plasma and pituitary ACTH concentrations by Cort, with normal values obtained at plasma Cort levels between 4.4 and 7.7 micrograms/dl. By contrast, rats with MBH and PVN lesions exhibited no ACTH responses to adrenalectomy when CRF infusions were between 0 and 1 micrograms/day. In rats with MBH and PVN lesions receiving 5 micrograms/day CRF, plasma ACTH concentrations were elevated and were not inhibited by plasma Cort values up to 6 micrograms/dl. Plasma ACTH was inhibited in rats with MBH lesions infused with 5 micrograms/day CRF when plasma Cort levels were 30.6 micrograms/dl. These rats also exhibited marked thymic atrophy. We conclude from these results that Cort normally acts only on a brain site to inhibit adrenalectomy-induced increases in ACTH secretion. Only when plasma Cort concentrations are markedly elevated can evidence for pituitary feedback be demonstrated in vivo.\r"

The RIA was performed on 27,000 x g supernatants of phosphate buffer extracts of adult rat testes, and revealed a high concentration of irCRF (51 - 74 ng/g testis), with a clear parallelism to the standard curve prepared with synthetic rat CRF. In contrast, the peripheral blood level of irCRF was extremely low (less than 0.05 ng/ml). Immunocytochemical studies of irCRF revealed strong specific staining in the Leydig cells and germ cells in normal adult rat testis. Epididymal spermatozoa also stained positive. Testicular irCRF fluctuated significantly with age. The levels (mean +/- SD) assayed in 10, 20, 60 and 90-day-old rats were 41.6 +/- 4.7, 8.7 +/- 0.2, 55.5 +/- 3.3 and 71.3 +/- 3.4 ng/g testis, respectively (P less than 0.01). The level was drastically reduced after abdominal translocation of a testis (9.6 +/- 1.3 ng/g testis), and after hypophysectomy (16.7 +/- 1.6 ng/g testis) in adult rats. However, neither hemicastration nor unilateral cryptorchidism influenced the irCRF levels in the contralateral testis. These data suggest a local production of irCRF which may play a role in regulation of Leydig cell function and sperm maturation in testis and epididymis.\r"

  ".W": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) administered into the lateral cerebral ventricle significantly inhibited gastric emptying and small bowel transit, but most markedly increased large bowel transit in a dose-related fashion in freely moving rats. Inhibition of gastric emptying induced by central administration of CRF was completely abolished by pretreatment of the animals with either the ganglionic blocking agent chlorisondamine or the opioid antagonist naloxone, or by noradrenergic blockade with bretylium, but not by truncal vagotomy. Either chlorisondamine, naloxone, or vagotomy--but not bretylium--reversed the inhibitory effect of central CRF on small bowel transit. Chlorisondamine or vagotomy, but neither bretylium nor naloxone, abolished the stimulatory effect of central CRF on large bowel transit. Neither hypophysectomy nor adrenalectomy altered the gastrointestinal motor responses induced by central administration of CRF. Intraperitoneal administration of CRF also significantly inhibited gastric emptying and stimulated large bowel transit but did not alter small bowel transit. These peripheral effects of CRF were not prevented by blockade of autonomic efferents with bretylium or chlorisondamine. It is concluded that (a) CRF acts within the central nervous system to delay gastric emptying, to inhibit small bowel transit, and to increase large bowel transit in freely moving rats and (b) CRF exerts these biological actions by modulation of the autonomic nervous system and, in part, by opioid pathways.\r"

At concentrations of 5%-10%, the potential difference decreased during exposure, but recovered after washout. No gross or light microscopic changes were observed. During exposure to 20%-40% ethanol, potential difference and short circuit current decreased and resistance increased, with only partial recovery after removal of the alcohol. Acid secretion ceased at 20% ethanol and alkalinization of the luminal solution was observed at greater than or equal to 30% ethanol. Microscopy of this group showed discharge of mucus, separation of oxynticopeptic cells from the basal lamina, and slough of surface epithelium. At 60%-100% ethanol, potential difference and short circuit current decreased and resistance increased markedly but there was no recovery. Microscopy showed changes similar to those of the intermediate group (20%-40%), except that surface epithelial cells were fixed to the basal lamina rather than sloughing. The morphologic effects of 100% ethanol in vivo were similar to those in vitro. Pretreatment with 10(-5) M 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 did not prevent either the electrophysiologic or the histologic changes caused by 20% and 30% ethanol. We conclude that there is a gross discrepancy between the functional and morphologic findings after high concentrations of luminal ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the differentiation and proliferation of human fetal jejunum was studied in organ cultures. Fetal intestine (11-14-wk gestation) was cultured for 5 days at 37 degrees C in serum-free Leibovitz L-15 medium alone or supplemented with 25, 50, and 100 ng EGF/ml culture medium. The addition of hormone did not modify the morphology of the intestinal explants. Biochemical studies revealed that lactase activity was significantly increased with the addition of 50 and 100 ng EGF/ml culture medium. On the other hand, the increase in sucrase, trehalase, and glucoamylase activities that normally occurs during the culture was repressed in the presence of increasing concentrations of EGF. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was significantly decreased after 5 days of culture even in the presence of the lowest EGF concentration used. Concomitantly, the labeling index of the epithelial cells dropped drastically in the presence of EGF. The EGF-induced variation in DNA synthesis was already evident within 24 h of culture, whereas enzymic modifications occurred only between the third and fifth day of culture. The simultaneous addition of EGF and hydrocortisone (50 ng/ml) did not reveal any synergistic action between the two hormones on the hydrolytic activities of the brush border. However, EGF did inhibit hydrocortisone-stimulated DNA synthesis. The present work provides for the first time some basic data on the influence of EGF on brush border hydrolytic activities and on epithelial cell proliferation of human fetal jejunum. These observations strongly suggest that EGF plays an important role in the fetal development of the human gastrointestinal tract.\r"

Gastric mucosal damage was assessed by measuring (a) 51Cr-labeled red blood cell leakage into the gastric lumen, (b) the area of gross mucosal lesions, and (c) the extent of histologically demonstrable mucosal damage. In rats treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid, but not in those treated with sulfapyridine, the leakage of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells and the area of gross mucosal lesions after ischemia/reperfusion were significantly reduced as compared with untreated (control) rats. Inasmuch as 5-aminosalicylic acid (the therapeutic moiety of sulfasalazine) has been reported to be a hydroxyl radical scavenger, we also assessed the effects of dimethylsulfoxide (another hydroxyl radical scavenger) on ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric mucosal injury. In rats treated with dimethylsulfoxide, leakage of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells and the area of gross mucosal lesions after ischemia/reperfusion were significantly reduced as compared with control rats. The results of this study support the contention that ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric bleeding involves the hydroxyl radical and indicate that 5-aminosalicylic acid significantly attenuates this vascular injury.\r"

  ".W": "Due to the marked effects of hemorrhage on cardiac output and splanchnic hemodynamics, the circulatory actions of vasopressin may differ during bleeding as opposed to stable conditions. We evaluated this hypothesis in conscious rats with portal hypertension due to chronic portal vein stenosis, by comparing the effects of a vasopressin infusion (0.02 IU per kg per min) to those of a control saline infusion, during and after a hypotensive hemorrhage (25 ml per kg). We also studied unbled portal hypertensive rats receiving an identical infusion of vasopressin or saline. During and after hemorrhage, vasopressin induced significant changes in systemic hemodynamics but had no effect on portal pressure, portal tributary blood flow and nonhepatic splanchnic arteriolar resistance. In unbled animals, by contrast, vasopressin decreased portal pressure and portal tributary blood flow and increased nonhepatic splanchnic arteriolar resistance. Our data further indicate that hemorrhage alone caused an early vasoconstriction in the portal tributaries and a delayed vasoconstriction in the nonsplanchnic vascular bed while vasopressin during hemorrhage induced an early and sustained vasoconstriction in the nonsplanchnic vascular bed as well as in the portal tributaries. The results show that, during and after severe bleeding, vasopressin exerts little influence on portal hemodynamics. Although these data do not allow firm conclusions concerning the therapeutic efficacy of vasopressin in bleeding esophageal varices, they demonstrate that the splanchnic actions of vasoactive substances cannot be readily extrapolated from stable conditions to hemorrhage.\r"

Thirty-eight patients (51%) developed one or more episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during follow-up, the probability of recurrence (Kaplan-Meier's method) being 43% at 6 months, 69% at 1 year and 74% at 2 years. Twenty-three variables (age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, standard liver and renal function tests and characteristics of the first spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) were analyzed as possible predictors of recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In univariate analysis (curves of Kaplan-Meier compared with Mantel-Cox's method), serum bilirubin greater than 4 mg per dl, prothrombin less than or equal to 45% and protein concentration in ascitic fluid less than or equal to 1 gm per dl were significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with a high risk or recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In multivariate analysis (Cox multiple regression model), only ascitic fluid protein concentration (p = 0.005) and prothrombin activity (p = 0.009) were found to be independent predictors of recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Fifty-nine patients (79%) died during follow-up, 18 of them (31%) secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

There were fewer re-amputations and more rapid stump healing among below-knee amputees who had received active TENS. Sham TENS had a considerable placebo effect on pain. There were, however, no significant differences in the analgesic requirements or reported prevalence of phantom pain between the groups during the first four weeks. The prevalence of phantom pain after active TENS was significantly lower after four months but not after more than one year.\r"

From January throughout December 1984, 4 patients underwent coronary angiography for severe symptoms of angina. The coronary angiography showed multiple stenoses on the left anterior descending (LAD), ventricular branches of the circumflex (CX), and posterior descending of the right coronary artery (PD). At operation the patients received a sequential aortocoronary bypass graft with reversed saphenous vein, plus the creation of a small A-V fistula into the right atrium in order to improve the graft flow and patency. All patients experienced a clinical improvement. No adverse effects have been observed and the patients, controlled clinically with non invasive and in two cases with invasive techniques, showed satisfactory revascularization.\r"

With a transducer applied in the suprasternal notch the main-stream aortic blood velocity recordings were obtained before and at maximum-tolerated supine exercise both prior to, and six weeks after, CABG. From the TAV recordings the stroke distance (Sd: or the systolic velocity integral which is a measure of the stroke volume) and minute distance (Md: or the measure of cardiac output) were derived as well as the percentage changes in these parameters with exercise (% delta Sd and % delta Md successively). Whereas no significant change following CABG was observed in the resting values for Sd, a significant improvement in the maximal exercise values for Sd and Md as well as the % delta Sd and % delta Md was noticed after CABG (p less than 0.001). Prior to CABG the % delta Sd (an indicator of left ventricular function) was significantly lower in 13 patients with a history of an old myocardial infarction (MI). The % delta Sd in these 13 patients was also significantly lower than that in the 17 patients without a history of MI though the improvement in the % delta Sd following CABG was similar in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The existence of feedback inhibition of ACTH on its own secretion has been postulated. To investigate its existence in man, the effects of synthetic ACTH 1-24 on endogenous ACTH secretion were tested in 13 patients with Addison's disease. Plasma ACTH was measured using an immunoradiometric assay, specific for endogenous ACTH 1-39. Ten patients were given 50 micrograms ACTH 1-24 as a bolus iv dose followed by a 50-microgram infusion in 90 min. Blood samples for ACTH and cortisol assay were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. As a control, a saline infusion was given 2 days earlier. Three other patients were given 100 micrograms ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) iv and ACTH 1-24 as described above. Blood samples for ACTH and cortisol assay were drawn every 15 min for 2 hours. A CRH test was performed during saline infusion as a control 2 days earlier. In all patients steroid replacement therapy was maintained during the studies. ACTH 1-24 caused a significant decrease (P less than 0.01) in endogenous plasma ACTH at 15 min compared to saline. oCHR administration markedly stimulated ACTH release in the three patients tested, and the ACTH response to oCRH was completely inhibited by the simultaneous administration of ACTH 1-24. These findings strongly support the presence of ACTH autoregulation in man. The complete inhibition of the ACTH response to oCRH by exogenous ACTH 1-24 provides evidence for ultra-short feed-back inhibition at the pituitary level.\r"

  ".W": "The glucocorticoid and progesterone antagonist RU 486 normalizes the clinical and biochemical features of hypercortisolism in patients with nonpituitary Cushing's syndrome, presumably by antagonizing the action(s) of cortisol. Since RU 486 has progesterone agonist activity in addition to its progesterone antagonist action, the possibility that it might have some glucocorticoid agonist action did not seem unreasonable. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of RU 486 on pituitary ACTH secretion in 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency in whom glucocorticoid replacement was withheld for 36 h. Each patient received, in randomized sequence 3-7 days apart, an oral dose of placebo, RU 486 (20 mg/kg), cortisol (0.1 mg/kg), or a combination of RU 486 and cortisol at 1800 h. Two hours later, an iv bolus dose of ovine CRH (1 microgram/kg) was administered, and plasma ACTH levels were measured serially for 3 h. RU 486 suppressed ovine CRH-stimulated ACTH secretion, albeit less than cortisol. Its glucocorticoid agonist effect was calculated to be approximately 1/250th that of cortisol on a weight basis. Additionally, RU 486 partially antagonized cortisol-induced suppression of ACTH secretion. These findings suggest that RU 486 is a partial glucocorticoid agonist and offer some insight as to its action in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Whether this degree of glucocorticoid agonist activity is adequate to support life, however, is not known.\r"

We examined its effects on the primate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by administering mouse EGF (mEGF) iv (0-100 micrograms/kg) to rhesus monkeys. mEGF caused dose-dependent elevations of plasma ACTH and cortisol in these animals. To define whether the locus of stimulation was the hypothalamus and/or the pituitary gland we examined the capacity of mEGF to directly stimulate hypothalamic CRH or pituitary ACTH secretion in a rat hypothalamic organ culture system and a rat pituitary cell system, respectively. mEGF stimulated hypothalamic CRH release in a dose-dependent manner, but failed to cause pituitary ACTH release. We conclude that EGF is a stimulator of the HPA axis in primates. Thus, EGF, and/or one of its naturally occurring analogs, may participate in the physiological activation of the HPA axis at times during which the concentrations of these factors are raised in the systemic circulation and/or locally in the hypothalamus. Such states may include trauma, surgery, and possibly emotional stress.\r"

Venous blood was obtained every 4 h for 24 h from each subject in January, March, June, August, and November 1984. Three subjects were also studied in April and/or August and/or November 1983 for the T subsets only. Mononuclear cells were isolated on Ficoll-Paque gradient and aliquots were incubated with OKT3, OKT4, OKT8, or HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies for characterizing all, T, T helper, T suppressor-cytotoxic, and NK lymphocytes, respectively, under an epifluorescence microscope. An effect of both sampling time and study month was statistically validated (P less than 0.01) with both two-way analysis of variance and cosinor for the peripheral counts in total, pan-T, T helper, and NK lymphocytes (cells per cubic millimeter). Seasonal changes affected both the circadian patterns and the 24-h mean values. Thus the double amplitude (total extent of variation) of the circadian rhythm in circulating total, T and T helper lymphocytes varied between 0 in March (P greater than 0.30; no rhythm) and up to 46-68% of the 24-h-mean (M) in November, with acrophases (times of maximum, 0) localized in the first half of the night (P less than 0.001). Maximal values were found at 8:30 h for both T suppressor-cytotoxic and NK lymphocytes; a smaller second peak was also found at 20:30 h, and a 12-h rhythm was validated by cosinor (P less than 0.0001), with no patient change in waveform along the year scale. A circannual rhythm was statistically validated by cosinor for total (0 in November), pan-T (0 in March), T suppressor-cytotoxic (0 in December), and NK lymphocytes (0 in October). A rhythm with a period equal to 6 mo was found for circulating T helper cells with 0 occurring both in April and October. Seasonal variations in the incidence of several immunologically related diseases may correspond to an endogenous circannual time structure.\r"

Antisera were prepared against purified F(ab')2 anti-PRP from two unrelated adults, H.H. and P.T. After repeated absorption with IgG myeloma proteins and with PRP-absorbed normal human Ig and donor Ig, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) sera were obtained that specifically reacted with anti-PRP antibodies. Anti-IdHH and anti-IdPT reciprocally crossreacted with H.H. and P.T. anti-PRP antibodies and F(ab')2 fragments, and also reacted with the serum anti-PRP antibodies from three additional adults unrelated to P.T. and H.H. Both anti-Id sera partially inhibited anti-PRP paratopes but not anti-tetanus toxoid paratopes. PRP did not inhibit anti-Id recognition of shared or crossreactive idiotypic (CRI) determinants. Naturally occurring and PRP immunization-induced anti-PRP antibodies expressed CRI. While CRI titer increased after immunization, the increase was usually less than the rise in total anti-PRP antibody. Quantitative differences in CRI expression were also apparent between natural and immunization-induced H.H. and P.T. anti-PRP antibodies as shown by their differential inhibitability by anti-Id. Our data demonstrate that anti-PRP antibodies from five unrelated adults express CRI determinants that are probably distant from the PRP combining site. Naturally occurring and immunization-induced anti-PRP antibodies share CRI and therefore appear to be clonally related, although immunization apparently induces the expression CRI-negative antibodies as well. These results, taken with previous studies showing restricted and identical anti-PRP isoelectric focusing spectrotypes in unrelated adults, suggest that some PRP-specific V domains are structurally conserved and probably germ-line encoded.\r"

  ".W": "Human retroviruses have recently been linked with T cell lymphoproliferative disorders and with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We investigated the mechanisms for acquired pure red cell aplasia and cutaneous anergy in a patient with the chronic T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease (T gamma-LPD) syndrome. Patient marrow erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) were 17 +/- 9% of control and were selectively increased to 88-102% of control after marrow T cell depletion. Patient Leu 2+ suppressor T cells spontaneously produced high titers of human gamma-interferon and resulted in a concentration-dependent selective inhibition (74-91%) of BFU-E when co-cultured with autologous or allogeneic marrow. Conditioned media (CM) derived from patient Leu 2+ T cells similarly inhibited growth of autologous or allogeneic marrow BFU-E. The inhibitory factor derived from patient CM was acid-labile (pH 2) and sensitive to trypsin; prior treatment of patient T cells with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody plus complement abrogated the suppressive effect of T cell-derived CM. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were unable to support growth of cultured interleukin 2 (IL 2)-dependent T cells, but responded to exogenous IL 2 in vitro with a 16-21-fold augmentation, relative to control, in mitogen-induced proliferation. Antibodies to HTLV-I core proteins p19 and p24 but not to HTLV-III proteins were detected in patient serum by Western blotting; patient cultured PBMC stained (7-11%) with antibodies to p19 and p24. Patient cultured PBMC demonstrated integrated HTLV-I genomic sequences by the Southern technique and expressed both specific HTLV-I genomic sequences by RNA dot blot plus reverse transcriptase activity. Utilizing a cloned DNA probe for the beta chain of the T cell receptor gene, patient PMBC demonstrated gene rearrangements providing presumptive evidence for clonality. The presence in serum of HTLV-I p19 and p24 antibodies, the expression of p19 and p24 core antigens on patient mononuclear cells, the evidence of HTLV-I proviral integration sequences and the expression of HTLV-I genomic sequences in patient cells, indicates infection with HTLV-I and raises the possibility of an etiologic link between human retrovirus infection and some instances of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T gamma-LPD).\r"

ApoB protein was detected within HBL hepatocytes utilizing immunohistochemical techniques; however, it was markedly reduced in quantity when compared with control samples. No apoB was detectable in the plasma of HBL individuals with an ELISA assay. These data are most consistent with a mutation in the coding portion of the apoB gene in HBL patients, leading to an abnormal apoB protein and apoB mRNA instability. These results are distinct from those previously noted in abetalipoproteinemia, which was characterized by an elevated level of hepatic apoB mRNA and accumulation of intracellular hepatic apoB protein.\r"

B cells cultured with Leu 3a+-enriched populations (B cells plus T3a) produced significantly more IgE and IgG in the presence of pokeweed mitogen than B cells with the Leu 2a+-enriched populations (B cells plus T2a) (p less than 0.001 for IgE and p less than 0.001 for IgG). No significant differences were observed in IgE and IgG synthesis between the cultures of B cells alone and B cells plus T2a. T2a, but not T3a cells, significantly suppressed IgE synthesis (p less than 0.05 for geometric means and p less than 0.001 for percent suppression) when the cells were added to cultures of B cells plus T3a. Suppression of IgG synthesis was not observed under conditions that suppressed IgE synthesis, suggesting qualitative and quantitative differences in regulation of production of these isotypes. When T2a cells were irradiated, the suppressor activity disappeared. When graded numbers of T3a cells were added to B cells, it was noted that IgE synthesis first increased and then decreased as the numbers of T3a were increased. When the T3a cells were irradiated, IgE biosynthesis was suppressed at lower T/B ratios (less than 1 in four of five experiments) and was enhanced at higher T/B ratios (greater than 1 in all five experiments). Similar results were observed in experiments with OKT4 and OKT8 monoclonal antibodies. It is concluded that phenotypes of helper T cells for IgE synthesis are Leu 3a+ or OKT4+ and that IgE suppressors are predominantly Leu 2a+ or OKT8+ and are radiosensitive, as reported for regulation of other isotypes. However, it is suggested that Leu 3a+ and OKT4+ cells consist of radioresistant and radiosensitive helper cells and, presumably, a minor population of suppressor cells.\r"

This phenomenon, which is seen as extensive fragmentation and solubilization of target cell DNA, is not seen with most other means of inducing cytolysis, including antibody- and complement-mediated cytolysis. We have previously shown that the degree of DNA solubilization is dependent upon the nature of the target cell. We here investigate the possibility that CTL induce, in all targets, damage to the nuclear envelope, which in turn leads to nuclear disintegration in only some of them. We reasoned that damage to the nuclear envelope would render nuclear DNA more accessible to exogenous DNase. Therefore, we determined the susceptibility of target DNA to exogenous DNase I after cytolysis by various means. We found no difference in DNA susceptibility for cells lysed by CTL vs methods (such as complement-mediated lysis or nonionic detergent) incapable of inducing nuclear disintegration. As a positive control, freezing and thawing dramatically enhanced susceptibility of the DNA. In conclusion, we found no evidence that the nuclear envelope is damaged by CTL in target cell types (or in the subpopulation of nuclei) that do not undergo nuclear disintegration.\r"

  ".U": "88116680\r", 
  ".W": "Treatment of mice with mAb to L3T4 profoundly depletes T helper cells. This treatment inhibits humoral and cellular immunity, retards autoimmunity, and permits the induction of Ag-specific tolerance. Treatment of BALB/c mice with F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 inhibits humoral immunity without depleting L3T4+ cells, which is evidence that mAb to L3T4 may inhibit T helper cell function in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 also permits the induction of immune tolerance in a manner that is independent of T cell depletion. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1 mg of F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 every other day for 18 days and from the onset were challenged weekly with the immunogen 2C7, a rat mAb to chicken ovalbumin. These mice failed to respond to 2C7 not only during the treatment period but also for at least 5 mo thereafter. This immune tolerance was Ag-specific; the mice rapidly produced antibodies to subsequent challenge with another Ag, human gamma-globulin. Unlike intact anti-L3T4, which immediately depletes L3T4+ cells by greater than 90%, F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 did not initially deplete cells and caused only a partial reduction by the end of the 18-day treatment. This partial reduction of L3T4+ cells did not contribute to the induction of tolerance because mice that were first challenged with 2C7 3 days after stopping the F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 treatment, when L3T4+ cells were lowest, had a normal Ir to 2C7. These findings demonstrate that mAb to L3T4 permits induction of Ag-specific immune tolerance by a mechanism independent of its ability to deplete L3T4+ cells. They also show that F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 treatment does not impair humoral immunity when immunization is initiated after treatment is stopped. Because L3T4 is homologous to CD4 in humans, our findings suggest that F(ab')2 anti-CD4 may offer significant advantages over the use of intact anti-CD4 as an immunosuppressive agent in humans.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/c mice were inoculated with normal C3H/He spleen cells via the portal venous (p.v.) route. Intravenous injection of serum from these BALB/c mice into naive syngeneic mice resulted in almost complete abrogation of their ability to generate anti-C3H/He delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses as induced by s.c. immunization with C3H/He cells. Since a portion of the same serum did not inhibit the development of anti-C57BL/6 DTH responses, the suppressive effect of the transferred serum was alloantigen-specific. Such serum factor(s) was produced in normal but not in nude mice and the suppressive activity was transferred in H-2- or immunoglobulin allotype-incompatible combinations. Immunochemical analyses of this serum suppressive factor have revealed that its m.w. was approximately 150,000, corresponding to the size of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, and that the activity was trapped by protein A or by an anti-immunoglobulin column. Although the absorption of the serum from anti-C3H/He-tolerant BALB/c mice with C3H/He target spleen cells did not abrogate the suppressive activity, the additional absorption with spleen cells from anti-C3H/He hyperimmune BALB/c mice almost completely eliminated the suppressive potential. Moreover, pretreatment of BALB/c anti-C3H/He DTH effector spleen cells with the above serum from tolerant mice induced the inhibition of anti-C3H/He DTH responses. Taken together, these results indicate that a single injection of allogeneic cells via the p.v. route results in the production of antibody capable of inhibiting the capacity of DTH effector cells specific for alloantigens used for the p.v. presensitization.\r"

  ".W": "A definite cytotoxic activity was developed in a BALB/c (H-2d) anti-DBA/2 primary mixed leukocyte culture (MLC), which received interleukin 2 (IL-2) on day 3 of culture. This cytotoxic activity was minor histocompatibility antigens (MIHA)-specific at the stimulator level, and was not developed in a syngeneic (BALB/c anti-BALB/c) MLC. The addition of IL-2 on day 3 of culture was crucial; no or very weak cytotoxic activity was developed in MLC receiving IL-2 on day 0 or on both day 0 and day 3. Only appropriate MIHA-allogeneic tumor cells were lysed as the target of the cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activity seemed MIHA-specific also at the target level; it lysed tumor cells of DBA/2 mouse origin but not those of BALB/c (syngeneic) origin. Phenotypes of the cytotoxic effector cell were Thy-1+ Lyt-2+. We concluded from these results that MIHA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in the MIHA-allogeneic primary MLC. In this newly developed system, we studied genetic and antigenic requirements for primary anti-MIHA CTL responses in vitro. We demonstrated; among spleen cells (SC) of seven B10 H-2-congenic strains only SC of B10.D2 strain whose major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (H-2d) was compatible with the responder MHC effectively stimulated responder BALB/c (H-2d) SC for an anti-MIHA (DBA-C57BL-common) CTL response. Similarly, only SC of two out of seven C x B recombinant inbred strains (C x B.H and C x B.D), which were compatible at the MHC with responder SC, activated responder BALB/c SC for the response. The possibility that cells responding to H-2 alloantigens suppressed the anti-MIHA response was ruled out. Additional experiments showed that compatibility at the H-2K-end or the H-2D-end of the MHC was sufficient for a definite anti-MIHA response. These provided formal evidence that primary anti-MIHA CTL responses in vitro were MHC-restricted at the stimulator level. We then showed that sonication-disrupted SC or Sephadex G-10 column-passed nonadherent SC failed to stimulate responder SC for a primary anti-MIHA CTL response, whereas G-10-passed nonadherent SC responded well to adherent stimulator cells. Further study demonstrated that Ia+ adherent cells were the most active cell type as stimulator. Finally, we confirmed that the primary anti-MIHA CTL responses to adherent stimulator cells was MHC-restricted.\r"

  ".W": "(C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice transplanted with parental C57BL/6 spleen cells become splenic chimeras, show donor antihost cytotoxic T cell activity, and lose their T cell-mediated, humoral, and natural immunity. Injection of anti-asialo-GM1 (ASGM1) into transplanted mice strongly suppresses splenic cytotoxic activity and causes a significant reduction of spleen cells expressing ASGM1, Thy-1, and Lyt-2. In vitro treatment of spleen cells from transplanted mice with antibody and complement shows that the cytotoxic effector cells are ASGM1+, Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, L3T4-, NK1.1-, and H-2d-, hence of donor origin. The cytotoxic effector cells are specific for H-2d targets and lack NK activity. In an attempt to explore whether in vivo elimination of the cytotoxic effector cells has any influence on splenic chimerism or humoral immunity, F1 mice injected with parental splenocytes were treated with anti-ASGM 1. Results show that this treatment eliminates a substantial proportion of cytotoxic effector cells but has no effect on splenic chimerism or restoration of humoral immunity. It therefore appears that cytotoxic effector cells are not primarily responsible for induction of chimerism or suppression of humoral immunity. In support of this injection of parental spleen cells with the nu/nu mutation induces killer cells in F1 mice but fails to induce splenic chimerism or immunosuppression. In contrast, injection of parental spleen cells with the bg/bg mutation generates both splenic chimerism and suppression of humoral immunity although their ability to generate cytotoxic effector cells in F1 hosts is seriously impaired and comparable to the cytotoxic potential of C57BL/6 nu/nu cells. It is concluded that the ASGM1 + cytotoxic T cells are not primarily responsible for splenic chimerism and suppression of humoral immunity and that the two effects are likely caused by parental cells with a different phenotype and function.\r"

In the present work, it is shown that: 1) T cells and T helper cells from HgCl2-injected BN rats are able to actively transfer autoimmunity in normal BN rats; the disease transferred is exacerbated when recipients are treated with the antisuppressor/cytotoxic T cell monoclonal antibody (OX8); 2) normal T cells preincubated with HgCl2 are also able to transfer the disease in OX8-treated but not in T cell-depleted rats; and 3) T cells from HgCl2-injected BN rats also transferred the disease in both normal and T cell depleted rats. It is concluded that: 1) autoreactive T cells, and presumably anti-Ia T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of mercury-induced autoimmunity; 2) these autoreactive T cells induce suppressor/cytotoxic T cells to proliferate in normal syngeneic recipients; the fact that this T cell subset did not proliferate in HgCl2-injected BN rats suggests that HgCl2 also affects T suppressor cells; and 3) mercury-induced autoimmunity could result from the additive effect of the emergence of autoreactive T cells and of a defect at the T suppressor level.\r"

The B cells present in the thus obtained populations were analyzed for their ability to secrete IgM and IgG after stimulation in vitro with polyclonal B cell activators (PWM, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I), antigens (tetanus toxoid, type 4 pneumococcal polysaccharides), and soluble B cell differentiation factors. The results suggest that B cells capable of Ig and anti-tetanus toxoid or anti-type 4 pneumococcal polysaccharide antibody production after in vitro culture are localized in a relative small B cell subpopulation carrying the FMC7 determinant but lacking HB4. This holds true for both the IgM- and IgG-secreting B cells. These data further suggest that the majority of B cells found in the blood and which can be characterized as being surface IgM+/IgD+ HB4+ are immature cells unable to respond to differentiation-inducing signals.\r"

We show that IFN-alpha, which has no effect on B cell proliferation when used alone, can synergize with anti-mu antibody and can support DNA synthesis by anti-mu activated B cells. This was observed with normal B cells and in 4 of 10 patients with B cell-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These four patients were all responders to B cell growth factor (BCGF), whereas the responsiveness to IFN-alpha was not correlated with that of IL-2. The positive functional relationship between IFN-alpha and BCGF in these patients is emphasized by the synergistic effect of these two factors in two of these patients, and the lack of inhibition of BCGF response by even supraoptimal concentrations of IFN-alpha. Among the subgroup of patients unable to respond to IFN-alpha, a synergy between IFN-alpha and IL-2 could be observed.\r"

Recent studies demonstrated that both phorbol esters and antigen stimulation induced the rapid and transient modulation and phosphorylation of T4 on an IL-2-dependent line of cloned peripheral blood T4+ cells. In the current study, we define the kinetics of T4 phosphorylation and internalization induced by phorbol esters and determine the extent to which this metabolic pathway is required for T cell proliferation, activation, and HIV infection. On both peripheral blood T4+ cells and the T cell line Sup-T1, the modulation and internalization of surface T4 induced by phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDB) was preceded by rapid and transient phosphorylation. On both cell types, by 48 h, T4 was reexpressed on the cell surface in a nonphosphorylated form and was shown to be resistant to phosphorylation and internalization when these cells were reexposed to PDB. In contrast, T4 on the surface of PBL was neither phosphorylated nor down-modulated when PBL were stimulated by PHA, indicating that these effects were not simply the result of T cell activation or proliferation. In additional studies, we demonstrate that this pathway for T4 phosphorylation and internalization is not required for HIV infection by showing that 1) the binding of the HIV gp 120 envelope to T4 does not induce phosphorylation of T4, 2) Sup-T1 cells that are rendered resistant to phorbol ester-induced T4 internalization and phosphorylation by prolonged culture in PDB remain highly susceptible to HIV infection, and 3) clones of HIV-producing cells expressing high levels of surface T4 that is complexed with viral envelope remain susceptible to PDB-induced modulation of T4. This observation suggests that, at least on lymphoid cells, HIV penetration does not occur exclusively by R-mediated endocytosis.\r"

The avid binding of IgE antibodies to FcR on mast cells and basophils suggested the possible use of an IgE-immunotoxin in the treatment of malignant mastocytosis or as a method to generate mast cell-depleted animals for study. To this end, the effect of a covalent conjugate of rat myeloma IgE and ricin A chain on rat cutaneous mast cells was examined in vivo. IgE-ricin A chain was capable of binding to and sensitizing cutaneous mast cells in vivo as indicated by a bluing response to intracutaneous anti-ricin A chain. IgE-ricin A chain, given either as a single dose or, even more effectively, as two split doses, significantly reduced cutaneous histamine content for 6 to 8 days. Neither a mixture of IgE and ricin A chain that were not conjugated nor the induction of cutaneous mast cell degranulation with anti-IgE affected cutaneous histamine levels. Therefore, IgE-ricin A chain produces a prolonged depletion of cutaneous histamine levels.\r"

The effects of human recombinant IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were also given attention. rTNF alpha, as well as rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta, decreased the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into glycosaminoglycan to about 10% of the levels in the control. The half-maximal doses of rTNF alpha, rIL-1 alpha or rIL-1 beta required for the suppression of glycosaminoglycan synthesis (by rTNF alpha, rIL-1 alpha, and rIL-1 beta) were 2 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml, or 5 ng/ml, respectively. rTNF alpha stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the chondrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DNA synthesis was increased to about threefold over the control cultures in the presence of 1 microgram/ml rTNF alpha for 72 hr. The stimulatory effect of rTNF alpha on DNA synthesis was observed in both subconfluent and confluent cultures, whereas rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta had no stimulatory activity on DNA synthesis. The addition of rTNF alpha to the cultures of chondrocytes stimulated DNA synthesis, even in medium containing no fetal calf serum. The fetal calf serum acted synergistically with rTNF alpha in increasing DNA synthesis. We propose that both TNF and IL-1 may be involved in inflammatory diseases of cartilage, and that TNF alpha, but not IL-1, may have some physiologic growth factor function for chondrocytes.\r"

Circulating blood monocytes and some elicited macrophages retain a significant proliferative potential in response to colony-stimulating activity. Because a macrophage response is prominent in a variety of cutaneous immune reactions, we have studied the ability of conditioned media (CM) from a transformed murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM 212) and from normal murine keratinocytes to induce growth of peritoneal macrophages. CM from both normal and transformed keratinocyte cultures induces [3H]thymidine incorporation by thioglycollate-elicited, but not resident, peritoneal macrophages. IEF of PAM 212 CM reveals peaks of activity at pI 4.8 and less than or equal to 4.2. Analysis of CM by reversed-phase HPLC demonstrates active fractions that elute at 46 to 48% and 53 to 55% acetonitrile. The Mr of the 46 to 48% acetonitrile factor is 25 to 30 kDa by gel filtration HPLC. Polyclonal anti-granulocyte/macrophage (GM) CSF antibody blocks the induction of macrophage [3H]thymidine incorporation by factors with pI 4.8 and eluting at 46 to 48% acetonitrile but does not reduce the activity of crude CM or the factor eluting at 53 to 55% acetonitrile. Based on both physiochemical criteria and antibody neutralization, keratinocytes produce GM-CSF. Keratinocyte-derived factors, including GM-CSF, may play an important role in regulating cutaneous macrophage responses.\r"

Anti-HLA-CW3 CTL cross-react to a variable extent on the related alleles A3 and A24. Using a panel of target cells expressing native or recombinant HLA genes, we could map the epitope recognized by a CTL clone specific for CW3 to the second external (alpha 2) domain of CW3. Moreover, the epitope recognized by this clone could be mimicked by incubating P815 (HLA negative) target cells with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the CW3 alpha 2 domain (residues 171 to 182). Other independent anti-CW3 CTL clones with different fine specificities recognized the same CW3 peptide. In contrast, CTL clones specific for HLA-A24 or HLA-A3 that did not lyse P815-CW3 transfectants did not recognize this peptide. The CW3 peptide could be recognized on other tumor cell targets that were also of H-2d origin, but not on those of H-2b or H-2k origin. The requirement for the expression of H-2Kd by the target cells was directly demonstrated using L cell Kd transfectants. Our results suggest that the CTL response of DBA/2 mice immunized with P815-CW3 transfectants is predominantly Kd restricted and focused on epitopes contained within the 12 C-terminal amino acids of the alpha 2 domain.\r"

This study describes a DR3 haplotype commonly present in the American black population. Unlike the Northern European population in which almost all DR3 individuals are DQw2, approximately 50% of DR3-positive American blacks express a serologically undefined DQ allelic product. DNA restriction fragment analysis with the use of several unrelated individuals and an informative family has allowed us to identify unique DQ alpha- and beta-fragments associated with the DR3, DQw- haplotype. Based on fragment size, the DQ alpha genes of the DR3, DQw- and DRw8, DQw- haplotypes are similar as are the DQ beta genes of DR3, DQw-; DRw8, DQw-; and DR4, DQw- haplotypes. In addition, a DX beta gene polymorphism has been identified which is associated with some DR3 haplotypes including the American black DR3, DQw- haplotype. cDNA sequence analysis has revealed a DQw2-like alpha gene and a DQ beta gene which is similar to that previously described for a DR4, DQw- haplotype. It is postulated that recombination between DQ alpha and DQ beta genes and between the DQ and DX subregions has generated the various DR3 haplotypes and has played an important role in creating diversity in the HLA-D region.\r"

The inhibition was specific in that control lymph node cells immune to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were unaffected and totally responsive after treatment by the same immunotoxin.

  ".W": "The human B lymphocyte-associated CD37 antigen (gp40-52) has been characterized by the monoclonal antibody HD28. The CD37 antigen is strongly expressed on surface immunoglobulin positive B lymphocytes and weakly on a subpopulation of T lymphocytes and myeloid cells. The total molecular mass of the antigen ranges from approximately 40 to 52 kDa in B cell-derived leukemias and malignant lymphomas as well as in normal and anti-mu/B cell growth factor-activated tonsillar B cells. The polydisperse nature of the electrophoretic pattern of the CD37 antigen was found to be due to a microheterogeneity in its carbohydrate moiety. Biochemical analysis showed that the CD37 antigen derived from B cell-lines BJAB and LICR-LON-HMy2 consists of a single chain protein core of approximately 25 kDa to which two N-linked, complex carbohydrate antennae of various length are bound. The glycosylation of the molecule comprises about 50% of the total molecular mass. The molecule does not contain O-linked carbohydrate chains. In contrast, the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line, OCI.LY1, which is growth-dependent on human serum, carries a CD37 antigen with an additional carbohydrate chain resulting in a total molecular mass of approximately 40 to 64 kDa. At the electron microscopy level, this cell surface-expressed antigen was found to be associated with intracellular vesicles. The subcellular distribution of the CD37 antigen may reflect a function of this antigen both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. We found that, both due to its peculiar biochemical structure and its ultrastructural distribution, the CD37 antigen closely resembles the 46-kDa species of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The implications of this possible congruence for the function of the CD37 antigen are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and the corticosteroid dexamethasone have potent effects on lymphocyte function, although the effects of the former have not been well characterized. In the present studies murine B cell maturation was used as a model system to examine and compare the effects of TCDD and dexamethasone on cell function. Immunosuppression by TCDD and dexamethasone is mediated by binding to specific intracellular R referred to as the Ah and glucocorticoid R, respectively. Although both compounds were comparable in their ability to inhibit antibody responses to the T-independent antigen TNP-LPS, the events responsible for suppression were found to be distinct. Dexamethasone, although affecting multiple stages of B cell maturation, had its primary effect very early, manifested by inhibition of the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway. This was evidenced by a decrease in accumulation of inositol phosphate and surface Ia antigen expression as well as an inability to enter the cell cycle after stimulation with anti-Ig. In contrast, neither early signaling events nor proliferation were affected in B cells treated with TCDD. However, TCDD inhibited Ig secretion after stimulation of B cells with T cell-replacing factor, suggesting that TCDD modulates the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. These differential results were confirmed by monitoring the expression of surface antigens that occur on B cells, including Ia, 7D4, and PC.2, during this maturational process. Whereas dexamethasone inhibited the expression of surface antigens that occur early in maturation (Ia and 7D4), TCDD blocked only the expression of the plasma cell marker PC.2. Although TCDD altered later stages of the B cell cycle, the presence of TCDD was required at the time of initial activation to be effective, suggesting that TCDD may interfere with early cell programming.\r"

We report that cholera toxin, which activates adenylate cyclase by ADP ribosylation of a G protein, also reduces both inositol phosphate (IP) production and the rise in Cai in Con A-stimulated murine T cells. We find that similar dose-dependent inhibitory effects can be induced by each of four other agents that raise cAMP levels in such cells: forskolin, PGE2, 2-chloroadenosine, and isoproterenol. The effects of these agents on IP production are reversible and therefore do not simply reflect cytotoxicity. Activation by PHA and by antibody to the T3-epsilon-chain of the TCR complex are also inhibited by agents that increase intracellular cAMP. Thus, changes in cAMP concentration seem to regulate both IP production and the Ca2+ response, two early components of the mitogen-induced activation process.\r"

Similar numbers of L. monocytogenes were recovered from rIL-1 alpha-treated and control mice at up to 24 h after infection; however, by 48 h after infection more than 1 log10 fewer viable L. monocytogenes were recovered from the spleens of rIL-1 alpha-treated mice than from Listeria-infected controls. The difference in bacterial burden between IL-1 alpha-treated and control mice increased with time; by 7 days after infection viable L. monocytogenes had been eliminated from most rIL-1 alpha-treated mice, whereas control mice still harbored 10(4) to 10(5) L. monocytogenes per spleen and liver. Histopathologic examination confirmed that rIL-1 alpha-treated mice suffered considerably less damage to the spleen, liver, lung, and brain than did control mice. To determine whether rIL-1 alpha-mediated protection indirectly by augmenting the release of other cytokines, we determined serum levels of colony-stimulating activity and IFN activity in rIL-1 alpha-treated and control Listeria-infected mice. Treatment with rIL-alpha elicited an early burst of serum colony-stimulating activity as compared with sera from Listeria-infected control mice. These data suggest that exogenous administration of rIL-1 initiates release of colony-stimulating activity, and perhaps other cytokines, that accelerate the protective response of the infected host. Prophylactic augmentation of antimicrobial resistance by administration of rIL-1 alpha may be worthy of further evaluation.\r"

In comparison, the PNA+ subset from normal blood donors (about 5% of total mononuclear cells) contained mature monocytes that were found to be T6 negative. Electron microscopic studies using immunogold labeling showed that the T6 positive cells were slightly smaller than monocytes but larger than the classical lymphocytes and had common morphologic features with the Langerhans cells of the skin. Considering that patients suffering extensive damage of the epidermis require fast renewal of all skin elements, it is possible that the cells we identified in their peripheral blood are the precursors of the Langerhans cells of the skin en route from bone marrow to the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "Langerhans cells (LC) are epidermal antigen-presenting cells capable of inducing allogenic, antigen-specific, and cytotoxic T cell proliferation. Previous studies have examined the dynamics of LC maintained in vitro in crude epidermal cell (EC) suspensions in which the major cell type is the keratinocyte (KC). To avoid the confounding effects of KC and other immunoregulatory cells on LC dynamics in vitro, highly enriched murine LC (85%) were studied, through 72 h of incubation in vitro, for their ability to present alloantigen (in a primary allogenic proliferation assay) and foreign antigen (in a secondary autologous proliferation assay). The results were compared to similar studies using crude EC suspensions. Freshly prepared LC are very poor stimulators of a primary allogenic proliferation response, with a 12- to 16-fold increase in stimulatory capacity by 72 h using panned-enriched and crude EC suspensions, respectively. Similarly, freshly prepared LC are weak stimulators of a secondary autologous proliferation response, with a 2.5- to 6-fold increase in immunostimulatory capability by 72 h. The overall increased stimulatory effect observed with the crude EC suspensions compared to highly enriched LC is most likely attributed to the effect of KC on T cell proliferation, rather than to a maturation effect of KC on LC during the 72 h of in vitro incubation. Using back-scattered electron imaging, the surface density of MHC-class II molecules (Ia) increased three- to fourfold through culture, which parallels the increase in functional ability. This study demonstrates that LC in either a crude or highly enriched cell suspension mature into potent immunostimulatory cells after incubation in vitro with an increased surface expression of Ia molecules. Keratinocytes are not necessary for LC maturation in vitro, but seem to exert some stimulatory effect by enhancing lymphocyte proliferation in the functional assay system.\r"

In the present study, we investigated 20 patients with confirmed or suspected allergic contact dermatitis by using the suction blister technique before and during patch testing. The ETAF/IL-1 was found in epidermis before patch testing. Its presence increased 2.8-fold in epidermis overlying a positive patch test compared with pretesting values. This increase was statistically significant. Interestingly, nontested skin also showed a significant increase of ETAF/IL-1, which was 1.9-fold higher than pretest values. The ETAF/IL-1 activity in patch test areas was significantly correlated with the clinical response. ELCF is not present in epidermis from noneczematous persons. We observed a significant content of ELCF in three of seven patients with eczema prior to patch testing. After patch testing, all patients showed ELCF in epidermis. Nontested skin showed a 1.5-fold higher content of ELCF compared with pretest values, and in the test area ELCF was 1.8-fold higher. The increases were statistically significant. We performed mixed skin lymphocyte reactions in seven patients using epidermal cells from the patch test area. All patients with a positive patch test had an increased mixed skin lymphocyte reactivity compared with epidermis coming from a negative reaction.\r"

Subsequent postsurgical follow-ups were done at 3-, 12-, and 24-month intervals. These data suggest that the profiles retained their characteristic shape and were still statistically different from each other, but the overall elevation decreased significantly after successful surgical intervention. To externally validate these profiles, the five derived groups were compared in terms of Beck Depression scores and the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory. These results were consistent with the MMPI. These data are discussed in terms of developing models for assessing the interaction of personality and specific stressors.\r"

In the present study, the systematic investigation of conditioning stimulation that was previously reported by the author has been extended to include short trains of stimuli at a low repetition rate (0.1 to 5 Hz) delivered to dissected skin and muscle nerves in the lightly anesthetized rat. The size of a C-fiber-evoked flexion reflex was utilized as a measure of transmission from nociceptive afferent nerve fibers in the spinal cord and was tested repeatedly after 30 minutes of conditioning TENS-like stimulation to adjacent nerves. At these low rates, stimulation of a muscle nerve was usually more effective in suppressing transmission from C-fibers to second-order neurons than was stimulation of a skin nerve. Furthermore, a stimulation strength recruiting both Group I-II and III muscle afferent fibers was more effective in depressing the C-fiber-evoked activity at all frequencies studied than was that activating Group I-II fibers only. A pulse-train repetition rate of around 1 Hz was most effective. These findings should be taken into account when carrying out clinical TENS treatment.\r"

Regardless of dietary iron concentrations, male and female rats consuming low copper diets had lower serum ceruloplasmin activity and serum and liver copper concentrations than those fed the high copper diet. However, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were higher in copper-deficient females than in copper-deficient males and were unaffected by copper deficiency in females fed the high iron diet. Copper-deficient females also had higher serum and liver iron concentrations than copper-deficient males. Proliferation of concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated spleen lymphoid cells (SLC) was suppressed in copper-deficient males and females, but the suppression was less in the females. Thus, the primary cause of suppressed SLC proliferation in copper-deficient rats is poor copper status; poor iron status induced by copper deficiency had little influence on proliferation.\r"

Antibody titers to CMV, EBV, and HSV-1 did not significantly rise in or differ between men who did or did not get HIV infection. However, we found that 32 (68%) of 47 HIV seroconverters had antibodies to HSV-2 at the time the third specimen was drawn, whereas only 26 (46%) of 57 men who remained HIV seronegative had HSV-2 antibody positivity. Seroconversion to HSV-2 between any two serum specimens was found in 11 (42%) of the 26 HIV seroconverters but in only five (14%) of 35 men who remained HIV seronegative. The association between HSV-2 seropositivity (or seroconversion) and subsequent or concurrent HIV seroconversion remained when we controlled for factors known to influence HIV infection, including age, number of sexual partners, and percentage of sexual acts involving receptive anal intercourse. These serologic studies do not support the role of CMV, EBV, or HSV-1 in HIV infection but do suggest that HSV-2 infection is a risk factor for subsequent or concurrent HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Of all patients with acute evolving myocardial infarction treated surgically at Duke University Medical Center between 1984 and 1986, 27 patients given high doses (greater than 1.5 million units) of streptokinase preoperatively were studied. Eleven patients who received streptokinase had coronary bypass grafting 12 hours after thrombolytic therapy (early hours), eight patients between 12 and 72 hours (delayed), and eight patients beyond 72 hours (late hours). Seventeen patients who underwent coronary bypass grafting within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, without preoperative streptokinase, were included as control patients. Only the patients having early operation had significantly greater postoperative blood loss; postoperative use of red blood cells; fresh-frozen plasma; cryoprecipitate; prolonged postoperative prothrombin time; and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Patients having delayed or late operations did not differ significantly from patients not receiving streptokinase. Only the interval between time of streptokinase administration and operation could account for the coagulopathy and the postoperative bleeding complications in the early group. Patients in the early group had a higher in-hospital mortality (27% versus 6% for the non-streptokinase group) and major noncardiac morbidity (36% versus 12% for the non-streptokinase group). Patients in the delayed and late groups had minimal postoperative complications and no mortality. Observations were not explained by differences in total ischemic time, number of angioplasty failures, or number of patients with cardiogenic shock between the early group and the non-streptokinase group. Postoperative bleeding and massive use of blood products seemed to be contributory factors: Two of three deaths in the patients having early operations were associated with clinical suspicion of tamponade. Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting within 12 hours of streptokinase therapy appear to be a high-risk group in a more emergent, uncontrolled clinical setting and require aggressive monitoring and correction of coagulopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative low cardiac output is the most common cause of death in patients undergoing elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The incidence is much higher than in elective adult bypass operations for coronary artery disease. To explain this difference, we investigated 16 children having elective repair of tetralogy (mean age 6.3 years). Myocardial biopsy specimens obtained during bypass before arrest, at the end of cold arrest by blood cardioplegia, and after 30 minutes of reperfusion were studied for adenosine triphosphate and lactate levels. Myocardium was submitted for microscopic study shortly after the onset of ischemia. The operation was successful in reducing right ventricular-pulmonary artery gradients from 82 +/- 28 to 9 +/- 1 mm Hg, yet seven patients required significant inotropic support (dopamine, greater than 5 micrograms/kg/min) for more than 24 hours and 12 patients needed prolonged use of digoxin and diuretics for right ventricular failure. Tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate and lactate in the tetralogy groups were compared with those in 20 adults with coronary artery disease having similar myocardial protection techniques. Adenosine triphosphate levels in the tetralogy group decreased during cross-clamping (41 +/- 8 minutes) from 24 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 2 mmol/kg dry weight (mean +/- 1 standard error), with a marked further drop after reperfusion to 9 +/- 2 mmol/kg (p less than 0.01). Adenosine triphosphate levels in the group with coronary disease also decreased from 20 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 1 mmol/kg after a longer cross-clamp time (70 +/- 17 minutes) but remained at 15 +/- 2 mmol/kg after reperfusion. Tissue lactate levels in the tetralogy group rose markedly during ischemia and remained elevated after reperfusion. In contrast, lactate levels in the group with coronary disease rose moderately during ischemia and returned to normal early on reperfusion. Microscopic study revealed focal myocyte necrosis in tetralogy of Fallot. Our findings, which demonstrate inadequate myocardial protection of patients with tetralogy during repair, with depression of adenosine triphosphate and increased lactate during ischemia and reperfusion, suggest a defect in oxidative metabolism. The drop in adenosine triphosphate after reperfusion in the patients with tetralogy implicates reperfusion injury as a mechanism of myocardial damage.\r"

By contrast, the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase reached peak values at the fourth postoperative hour and was significantly higher in patients with perioperative myocardial infarction from the fourth to the tenth postoperative hours. We conclude that myoglobin is a valuable marker of perioperative myocardial damage and is an earlier and more specific marker of perioperative myocardial infarction than creatine kinase MB.\r"

HIV recognition of CD4 is probably mediated through the virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) as shown by co-immunoprecipitation of CD4 and gp120 (ref.5) and by experiments using recombinant gp120 as a binding probe. Here we demonstrate that recombinant soluble CD4(rsT4) purified from the conditioned medium of a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line is a potent inhibitor of both virus replication and virus-induced cell fusion (syncytium formation). These results suggest that rsT4 is sufficient to bind HIV, and that it represents a potential anti-viral therapy for HIV infection.\r"

CD4 also functions as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exterior envelope glycoprotein (gp120) (refs 4-9), being essential for virus entry into the host cell and for membrane fusion, which contributes to cell-to-cell transmission of the virus and to its cytopathic effects. We have used a baculovirus expression system to generate mg quantities of a hydrophilic extracellular segment of CD4. Concentrations of soluble CD4 in the nanomolar range, like certain anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, inhibit syncytium formation and HIV infection by binding gp120-expressing cells. Perhaps more importantly, class II specific T-cell interactions are uninhibited by soluble CD4 protein, whereas they are virtually abrogated by equivalent amounts of anti-T4 antibody. This may reflect substantial differences in CD4 affinity for gp120 and class II MHC.\r"

The CD4 protein is also the receptor for HIV, a T-lymphotropic RNA virus responsible for the human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (refs 4-7). To define the mechanisms of interaction of CD4 with the surface of antigen-presenting cells and with HIV, we have isolated the CD4 gene and expressed this gene in several different cellular environments. Here we describe an efficient expression system in which a recombinant, soluble form of CD4 (sCD4) is secreted into tissue culture supernatants. This sCD4 retains the structural and biological properties of CD4 on the cell surface, binds to the envelope glycoprotein (gp110) of HIV and inhibits the binding of virus to CD4+ lymphocytes, resulting in a striking inhibition of virus infectivity.\r"

One route to block HIV infection, therefore, could use solubilized CD4 protein to inhibit attachment of the virus to its target cell.

The sequence of events leading to the various phenomena is still poorly understood. Both changes in extra- and intracellular pH (refs 1-4) and selective transcription are known to be induced by auxin. Evidence for auxin receptors at the plasmalemma membrane has been reported, but the signal transduction pathway is not known, for this nor for other plant hormones. In animal cells, hydrolysis of inositolphospholipids is a major mechanism for transmembrane signalling in response to external stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, antigens or light (reviewed in refs 8-11). Here we report that auxin can generate transient changes in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol bisphosphate (InsP2) within minutes in Catharanthus roseus cells arrested in G1. These changes are accompanied by a redistribution within the polyphosphoinositide fraction. As the physiological response to auxin addition is to relieve the arrest in G1, we suggest that these effects are an element in the signal transduction of this plant hormone.\r"

  ".W": "In taste chemoreception, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) appears to be one of the intracellular messengers coupling reception of stimulus to the generation of the response. The recent finding that sweet agents cause a GTP-dependent generation of cAMP poses the question of how this cytosolic messenger acts at the membrane of taste receptor cells. We have shown that cAMP causes a substantial depolarization in these cells. Here we show with whole-cell recordings and inside-out membrane patches that the depolarization caused by cAMP is accounted for by the action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which inactivates potassium channels predominantly of 44 pS conductance. Thus, intracellular signalling of the gustatory cells differs from that of olfactory and photoreceptor cells, where cyclic nucleotides control unspecific channels by binding to them rather than by inducing their phosphorylation.\r"

In a poorly understood series of events, the protein antigen is internalized, transformed and re-expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell in association with gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Small peptides derived from the native protein can be recognized in the absence of antigen processing, suggesting that processing involves proteolytic degradation. These peptides are thought to mimic the naturally produced peptide fragment. We describe here a synthetic peptide antigen of this type which does not require processing but which is nevertheless further processed by splenic antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, this processing event specifically alters the interaction of the peptide with the class II MHC (Ia) molecule, markedly affecting both its potency as an antigen in vitro and its immunogenicity in vivo (IR gene control).\r"

  ".W": "Generation of an immune response depends on the interaction of haematopoietic cell types, among which T cells and their receptors are of central importance. The T-cell receptor is a heterodimer consisting of disulphide-linked alpha and beta-chains, each chain divided into variable (V) and constant (C) regions. The beta-chain is encoded by the rearrangement of separate variable (V beta), diversity (D beta) and joining (J beta) gene segments during T-cell differentiation. To examine the mechanisms of somatic DNA rearrangement and evolution of the beta-gene segments, we have constructed a physical map of the human T-cell receptor beta-chain family containing 40 V beta gene segments as well as both C beta gene clusters. A comparison of the published nucleotide sequences of human and murine V beta gene segments reveals 12 examples of gene segments sharing 65% or more interspecies homology. The relative order of these human and murine V beta gene segment homologues is also conserved along the chromosome, apart from more extensive human gene duplication, presumably as a consequence of constraints imposed on evolutionary mechanisms operating to diversify these gene families or of selective pressures operating to maintain order.\r"

However, comparison of the amino acid sequence of PGF synthase with the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein data base reveals that the sequences of 225 amino acids from C termini of epsilon-crystallin of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) [Tomarev, S.I., Zinovieva, R.D., Dolgilevich, S.M., Luchin, S.V., Krayev, A.S., Skryabin, K.G. & Gause, G.G.

Synthesis of the EGF precursor can be induced by culturing the cells in 5 mM butyric acid or 100 microM ZnCl2. The EGF precursor synthesized by these cells appears to be membrane associated; none is detectable in the cytoplasm. The size of the EGF precursor expressed by these cells is approximately 150-180 kDa, which is larger than expected from its amino acid sequence, suggesting that it is posttranslationally modified, presumably by glycosylation. The EGF precursor was also detected in the conditioned medium from these cells, indicating that some fraction of the EGF precursor synthesized by these transfected cells may be secreted. Preliminary data suggest that this soluble form of the EGF precursor may compete with 125I-labeled EGF for binding to the EGF receptor. These cell lines should be useful for studying the processing of the EGF precursor to EGF as well as determining the properties and possible functions of the EGF precursor itself.\r"

In this report, a cDNA clone that encodes the B1 molecule was isolated and the amino acid sequence of B1 was determined. B-cell-specific cDNA clones were selected from a human tonsillar cDNA library by differential hybridization with labeled cDNA derived from either size-fractionated B-cell mRNA or size-fractionated T-cell mRNA. Of the 261 cDNA clones isolated, 3 cross-hybridizing cDNA clones were chosen as potential candidates for encoding B1 based on their selective hybridization to RNA from B1-positive cell lines. The longest clone, pB1-21, contained a 2.8-kilobase insert with an 891-base-pair open reading frame that encodes a protein of 33 kDa. mRNA synthesized from the pB1-21 cDNA clone in vitro was translated into a protein of the same apparent molecular weight as B1. Limited proteinase digestion of the pB1-21 translation product and B1 generated peptides of the same sizes, indicating that the pB1-21 cDNA encodes the B1 molecule. Gel blot analysis indicated that pB1-21 hybridized with two mRNA species of 2.8 and 3.4 kilobases only in B1-positive cell lines. The amino acid sequence deduced from the pB1-21 nucleotide sequence apparently lacks a signal sequence and contains three extensive hydrophobic regions. The deduced B1 amino acid sequence shows no significant homology with other known proteins.\r"

Stimulation of resting peripheral human lymphocytes with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in the CD8+ subpopulation. As demonstrated here, OKT3 stimulation also induces expression of cell-surface HRF by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. The small proportion of Leu 19+ natural killer lymphocytes present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was found to express HRF prior to stimulation. Whereas unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were susceptible to lysis by the membrane-attack complex or by the C9-related protein, OKT3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were relatively resistant to both the membrane-attack complex and C9-related protein. This acquired resistance was abrogated by blocking surface HRF with F(ab')2 anti-HRF, suggesting that resistance was due to lymphocyte-membrane HRF. By using solid-phase anti-HRF, a 65-kDa protein was isolated from the activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and shown to be capable of conferring upon sheep erythrocytes the characteristic activity of human HRF.\r"

Approximately 1 of 300-400 spleen cells expressed detectable IL-4 mRNA 24 hr after their stimulation by the lectin concanavalin A. Spleen cells were also induced to express mRNA for IL-4 by stimulation with alloantigens. Splenocytes producing mRNA for IL-4 were detected 4 hr after stimulation by concanavalin A; the response peaked at approximately equal to 24 hr and was undetectable by 72 hr. Cyclosporin A inhibited the synthesis of IL-4 mRNA in the T-cell line 2.19, which had been induced by concanavalin A. Approximately 1 of 10 fetal thymocytes at day 14 of gestation expressed mRNA for IL-4 after their stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. Both the frequency of fetal thymocytes expressing IL-4 mRNA and the amount of mRNA for IL-4 synthesized per cell sharply decreased at day 16 of gestation, and less than 1 of 1800 fetal thymocytes at day 18 of gestation expressed detectable IL-4 mRNA. Our results define the relative frequency of cells capable of expressing IL-4 mRNA after stimulation in vitro in the spleen and in the developing thymus. The data strongly argue for an important role of IL-4 in growth and differentiation of lymphoid cells, notably during T-cell development within the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Celiac disease has one of the strongest associations with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class II markers of the known HLA-linked diseases. This association is primarily with the class II serologic specificities HLA-DR3 and -DQw2. We previously described a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) characterized by the presence of a 4.0-kilobase Rsa I fragment derived from an HLA class II beta-chain gene, which distinguishes the class II HLA haplotype of celiac disease patients from those of many serologically matched controls. We now report the isolation of this beta-chain gene from a bacteriophage genomic library constructed from the DNA of a celiac disease patient. Based on restriction mapping and differential hybridization with class II cDNA and oligonucleotide probes, this gene was identified as one encoding an HLA-DP beta chain. This celiac disease-associated HLA-DP beta-chain gene was flanked by HLA-DP alpha-chain genes and, therefore, was probably in its normal chromosomal location. The HLA-DP alpha-chain genes of celiac disease patients also were studied by RFLP analysis; 84% of HLA-DR3, -DQw2 patients had a 16-kb Xba I fragment that was present in only 36% of HLA-DR3, -DQw2 controls. Moreover, 79% of these patients had both alpha- and beta-chain polymorphisms in contrast to 27% of controls. Thus, celiac disease is associated with a subset of HLA-DR3, -DQw2 haplotypes characterized by HLA-DP alpha- and beta-chain gene RFLPs. Within the celiac-disease patient population, the joint segregation of these HLA-DP genes with those encoding the serologic specificities HLA-DR3 and -DQw2 indicates: (i) that the class II HLA haplotype associated with celiac disease is extended throughout the entire HLA-D region, and (ii) that celiac-disease susceptibility genes may reside as far centromeric on this haplotype as the HLA-DP subregion.\r"

Apparently complete class I non-HLA-A, B, C genes have been identified on HindIII-generated 5.4-kilobase (kb), 6.0-kb, and 6.2-kb DNA fragments derived from lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) 721. We studied the expressibility of these genes by subcloning them into the nonintegrating pHeBo vector and transferring the chimeric plasmids into mutant LCL 721.221. This mutant was derived from LCL 721 by means of immunoselections following gamma-ray mutagenesis that eliminated expressions of the HLA-A, -B, and -C alpha chains. The HLA-A, B, C-null phenotype of mutant 721.221 made it possible to monitor the expression of class I genes transferred into it by assaying cell surface binding of monoclonal antibodies BBM.1 and W6/32, which recognize beta 2-microglobulin and HLA class I alpha-chain epitopes, respectively. Increased binding of BBM.1 and W6/32 was clearly observed in transferents containing the class I gene of the 6.0-kb DNA fragment but not in transferents containing the class I genes of the 5.4- and 6.2-kb DNA fragments. However, one-dimensional gel electrophoresis of BBM.1 and W6/32 immunoprecipitates made with [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates showed that transfer of each non-HLA-A, B, C class I gene into 721.221 resulted in the appearance of an alpha chain that coprecipitated with beta 2-microglobulin. The three previously unreported alpha chains differed from each other in size and were smaller than HLA-A, -B, and -C alpha chains. These observations clearly show that these three cloned, nonallelic, non-HLA-A, B, C class I genes encode alpha chains that can be expressed in human cells.\r"

In a first series of experiments, expression of the alpha, beta A, and beta B subunits of inhibin were monitored in various tissues from male and female rats. Two observations emerge from these studies. First, expression of inhibin subunits was found in gonadal and extragonadal tissues. In addition to the ovary and testis, inhibin alpha, beta A, and beta B RNAs were detected in the placenta, pituitary, adrenal, bone marrow, kidney, spinal cord, and brain. Detection of inhibin RNAs in the brain and spinal cord suggested that these subunits may exert neuroregulatory functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Furthermore, the presence of inhibin alpha and beta subunits in the placenta and the pituitary gland, two cell types that have clearly been shown to be regulated by exogenous inhibin, may reflect existing paracrine and/or autocrine processes active in these tissues. The second observation is that expression of inhibin subunit RNAs may vary by severalfold in a tissue-specific fashion. for example, alpha-subunit RNA levels are abundant in the gonads, whereas beta A-subunit RNA is predominant in the placenta and bone marrow. Finally, it is noted that expression of testicular inhibin RNA subunits decreases during sexual maturation. We conclude that the dimers comprised of inhibin subunits possess diverse functions and may act as growth/differentiation factors as well as a hormone.\r"

A cDNA clone corresponding to 5-lipoxygenase was isolated from a human lung lambda gt11 expression library by immunoscreening with a polyclonal antibody. Additional clones from a human placenta lambda gt11 cDNA library were obtained by plaque hybridization with the 32P-labeled lung cDNA clone. Sequence data obtained from several overlapping clones indicate that the composite cDNAs contain the complete coding region for the enzyme. From the deduced primary structure, 5-lipoxygenase encodes a 673 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 77,839. Direct analysis of the native protein and its proteolytic fragments confirmed the deduced composition, the amino-terminal amino acid sequence, and the structure of many internal segments. 5-Lipoxygenase has no apparent sequence homology with leukotriene A4 hydrolase or Ca2+ -binding proteins. RNA blot analysis indicated substantial amounts of an mRNA species of approximately equal to 2700 nucleotides in leukocytes, lung, and placenta.\r"

The expressed HA protein exhibited normal cleavage, transport to the cell membrane, and ability to adsorb and to fuse erythrocytes at pH 5. Site-specific mutagenesis of the HA directly established that (i) most of the basic amino acids at this site are critical for cleavage activation; (ii) besides the connecting peptide sequence, at least one other structural feature of the HA is required for enzyme recognition; and (iii) the length of the connecting peptide can abrogate the structural feature(s).\r"

  ".W": "Several clones hybridizing with a bovine ADP/ATP translocase cDNA were isolated from an adult human liver cDNA library in the vector pEX1. DNA sequence analysis revealed that these clones encode two distinct forms of translocase. In particular, two clones specifying the COOH-end-proximal five-sixths of the protein exhibit a 9% amino acid sequence divergence and totally dissimilar 3' untranslated regions. One of these cDNAs is nearly identical in sequence to an ADP/ATP translocase clone (hp2F1) recently isolated from a human fibroblast cDNA library [Battini, R., Ferrari, S., Kaczmarek, L., Calabretta, B., Chen, S. & Baserga, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4355-4359], with three amino acid changes and a few differences in the 3' untranslated region. Another clone isolated from the pEX1 library contains a reading frame encoding the remaining, NH2-end-proximal, 37 amino acids of the translocase. This sequence differs significantly (14% amino acid sequence divergence) from the corresponding segment of hp2F1, and the 5' untranslated regions of the two clones are totally dissimilar. RNA transfer hybridization experiments utilizing the clones isolated from the pEX1 library revealed the presence in HeLa cells of three distinct mRNA species. The pattern of hybridization and the sizes of these mRNAs suggest a greater complexity of organization and expression of the ADP/ATP translocase genes in human cells than indicated by the analysis of the cDNA clones.\r"

This kinase is eluted as a single peak of activity from either a Mono Q anion-exchange column at 0.34 M NaCl or a Mono S cation-exchange column at 0.20 M NaCl. Treatment of the peak fraction from the Mono S column with phosphatase 2A completely abolishes the activity of the enzyme. The kinase appears to be distinct from protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and two protease-activated kinases, PAK II and H4P. The kinase has been purified to apparent homogeneity and migrates as a single band at Mr 70,000 in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. The kinase exhibits the ability to autophosphorylate, and this activity directly parallels S6 phosphorylation activity on the final step of purification. In vitro, the kinase incorporates up to 5 mol of phosphate into S6, and the tryptic phosphopeptide maps obtained are equivalent to those from S6 phosphorylated in vivo. Most important, treatment of the purified kinase with phosphatase 2A results in complete inactivation of the enzyme, arguing that the activity of the kinase is directly controlled by phosphorylation.\r"

The cell lines could be grown in serum-containing media as well as in chemically defined serum-free media, have a nearly normal human karyotype, did not form colonies in soft-agar medium, and were not tumorigenic after injection into nude mice. For immortalization of human lymphocytes, DNA from L929 cytoplasts was 100-fold more efficient than L929 nuclear DNA. The ability of cytoplast DNA to immortalize lymphocytes could be consecutively transferred by using total cellular DNA from primary or secondary transfectants. Circular or linear mitochondrial DNA of L929 cells did not lead to immortalization of human lymphocytes. Since DNA with immortalizing activity could be isolated from cytoplasts, the Hirt supernatant, and a mitochondria-depleted cytoplasmic fraction of L929 cells, we conclude that the immortalizing DNA is located extramitochondrially in the cytoplasm of L929 cells.\r"

The levels of transcripts of injected early and late genes and of endogenous early genes were monitored during development by a ribonuclease protection assay. Transcripts of both the injected and endogenous early genes peaked during the blastula stage and decreased severalfold by the mesenchyme blastula stage. Transcripts of the injected late gene became detectable at the blastula stage and increased in amount subsequently, until at least the early gastrula stage, 28 hr after fertilization. Thus, the pattern of expression of the injected early and late H2B genes is similar to that of their endogenous counterparts. These results show that DNA sequences regulating the temporal pattern of early and late H2B gene expression must lie within the cloned DNA segments; i.e., within 600 base pairs of the early H2B gene and 3 kilobases of the late H2B gene.\r"

The insertion of new restriction sites within the infectious clone has allowed us to replace the wild-type sequences with short complementary pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides containing various mutations. A set of mutations have been made that create methionine codons within the genome-linked viral protein region. The resulting viruses have growth characteristics similar to wild type. Experiments that led to an alteration of the tyrosine residue responsible for the linkage to RNA have resulted in nonviable virus. In one mutant, proteolytic processing assayed in vitro appeared unimpaired by the mutation. We suggest that the position of the tyrosine residue is important for genome-linked viral protein function(s).\r"

Treatment of the same cells with anti-IgM antibodies failed to induce the formation of the factors. Analysis of cellular mechanisms indicated that polymerized surface IgD on B cells, as well as surface IgD-anti-IgD complexes shed from the B cells, induced T cells bearing Fc delta receptors to form IgD-binding factors. The factors formed by the anti-IgD treatment of splenic lymphocytes are composed of molecular mass species of 70 and 34 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration. Both the 70- and 34-kDa IgD-binding factors enhanced IgM and IgG1 plaque-forming cell responses of sheep erythrocyte-primed mouse spleen cells to the antigen.\r"

It role as a surface receptor has been reemphasized by our recent findings that IgD receptors are induced on helper T cells by exposure to IgD and that such cells have immunoaugmenting properties. The present study shows that crosslinking of soluble IgD or of monomeric cell surface IgD is required and sufficient for the induction of T cells bearing receptors for IgD, both in vivo and in vitro. Effective IgD crosslinking in this respect can be obtained with antigen or with heterologous and immunogenic as well as nonimmunogenic allotype-specific anti-IgD. These results reinforce the concept that the induction of T cells bearing receptors for IgD is an integral component of the normal immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of B cells to proliferation and antibody secretion is dependent on soluble lymphokines secreted by activated T cells. Activation of T cells results from physical contact between B cells and T cells through binding of the T-cell antigen receptor to a complex of antigen and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. To determine whether this interaction also contributes to B-cell activation by mechanisms other than those mediated by soluble T cell-derived lymphokines, I examined the ability of isolated T-cell plasma membranes to stimulate proliferation in cultures of unfractionated B cells. Membranes prepared from a cloned antigen-specific helper T-cell line induced substantial proliferation provided that the T cells had been mitogen-activated before isolation of membranes. Membranes from splenic Con A-treated blasts also stimulated B-cell proliferation, suggesting that this activity may be a common property of some subsets of activated T cells. Induction of B-cell proliferation was not found to be antigen-dependent or MHC-restricted, indicating no significant contribution by the T-cell receptor for antigen. The presence of interleukins 4 and 5 in membrane fractions was indicated by proliferation of lymphokine-sensitive cell lines, although culture supernatants from mitogen-activated T cells proved to be far more potent sources of these activities. The combined effect of membranes and lymphokine-containing culture supernatants in B-cell cultures was greater than their added effects in separate cultures. This observation suggests that lymphokines or molecules with mitogenic activity for B cells other than those found in abundance in culture supernatants may be present on activated T-cell membranes.\r"

To characterize this antigen at the molecular level, isolated P. yoelii 17XL DNA was used to construct a genomic library in the expression vector lambda gt11. A monoclonal antibody, mAb 302, which passively protected mice against P. yoelii challenge infection, was used to identify a lambda gt11 recombinant clone encoding a portion of the 230-kDa antigen of this parasite. Using this clone as a probe, we identified an mRNA of 7.6 kilobases by RNA blot analysis. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of the clone showed that the epitope recognized by the protective mAb 302 is encoded by the 3' portion of the gene for the 230-kDa antigen. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that this antigen also contains the tandemly repeated tetrapeptide Gly-Ala-Val-Pro, a series of 10 cysteine residues located within the terminal 110 amino acids, and a potential membrane anchor of 18 hydrophobic residues. Comparison of this C-terminal sequence with the carboxyl segment of the 195-kDa merozoite antigen of Plasmodium falciparum revealed nucleic acid and amino acid sequence similarities ranging from 40% to 70%. The localization of a B-cell epitope recognized by the protective mAb 302 to this carboxyl region of the P. yoelii antigen, combined with the limited strain variability in this region of the homologous 195-kDa antigen of P. falciparum, has implications for the development of an effective erythrocytic stage malarial vaccine.\r"

A region spanning two cytokine-specific sequences, cytokine 1 (CK-1, 5' GAGATTCCAC 3') and cytokine 2 (CK-2, 5' TCAGGTA 3') bound two nuclear proteins [nuclear factor (NF)-GMa and NF-GMb] from GM-CSF-expressing cells in gel retardation assays. NF-GMb was inducible with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and accompanied induction of GM-CSF message. NF-GMb was absent in cell lines not producing GM-CSF, some of which had other distinct binding proteins. NF-GMa and NF-GMb eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.3 and 0.6 M KCl, respectively. We hypothesize that the sequences CK-1 and CK-2 bind specific proteins and regulate GM-CSF transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Transfected, nonsteroidogenic COS-1 cells derived from monkey kidney are found to be capable of supporting the initial and rate-limiting step common to all steroidogenic pathways, the side-chain cleavage of cholesterol to produce pregnenolone. Endogenous COS-1 kidney cell renodoxin reductase and renodoxin are able to sustain low levels of this activity catalyzed by bovine cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) whose synthesis is directed by a transfected plasmid containing P450scc cDNA. Double transfection with both P450scc and adrenodoxin plasmids leads to greater pregnenolone production and indicates that adrenodoxin plays a role as a substrate for this reaction or that bovine adrenodoxin serves as a better electron donor than the endogenous iron-sulfur protein renodoxin. Also it is found that both the bovine adrenodoxin and P450scc precursor proteins are proteolytically processed upon their uptake by COS-1 cell mitochondria to forms having the same electrophoretic mobility as mature bovine adrenodoxin and P450scc. Following triple transfection of COS-1 cells with P450scc, adrenodoxin, and 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 plasmids, pregnenolone produced in mitochondria by the side-chain cleavage reaction can be further metabolized in the endoplasmic reticulum to 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Although this functional steroidogenic pathway can be incorporated into this nonsteroidogenic cell type, it is found to be nonresponsive to cAMP, a potent activator of steroid hormone biosynthesis in adrenal cortex, testis, and ovary. Thus the cellular mechanisms necessary to support both microsomal and mitochondrial steroid hydroxylase activities appear not to be tissue specific, whereas the acute cAMP-dependent regulation of steroidogenesis is not present in transformed kidney (COS-1) cells.\r"

Crosslinking CD3, CD4, and CD8 with monoclonal antibody and anti-antibody induced rapid accumulation of intracellular cAMP, occupancy of cAMP receptors, and was temporally associated with the mobilization and directed movement of these molecules to a pole of the cell. This capping process could be partially inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by treatment of T cells with 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, a ribose-modified adenosine analogue that binds to the P site of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase and reduces adenylate cyclase activity. Furthermore, inhibition of cAMP-dependent endogenous phosphorylation of 17.5-kDa, 23/25-kDa, and 33.5-kDa bands in intact T cells by N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide, a cell-permeable inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase, blocked the capping event. Data support the conclusion that crosslinking of CD3, CD4, and CD8 activates a cAMP-dependent pathway that mediates the mobilization and directed movement of these molecules. cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation is an integral step leading to the capping process.\r"

These channels display burst kinetics, multiple conductance levels between 35 and 420 pS, and open times in the millisecond range. With increasing concentrations of odorant, the probability of populating the higher conductance levels increases. These results show that direct activation of channels by odorants may mediate excitation of the olfactory receptor cell.\r"

The cells of two nonmuscle lines (HL-60 and PC12) and of two rat tissues (liver and pancreas) are shown here to express a protein that resembles CS in many respects (apparent mass and pH-dependent migration in NaDodSO4/PAGE; blue staining with StainsAll dye; Ca2+ binding ability) and is specifically recognized by affinity-purified antibodies against skeletal muscle CS. In these cells, the CS-like protein is shown by immunofluorescence and immunogold procedures to be localized within peculiar, heretofore unrecognized structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These structures appear to be discrete organelles, which we propose to be named \"calciosomes.\" By cell fractionation (Percoll gradient and free-flow electrophoresis), the CS-like protein of HL-60 cells is shown to copurify with the markers of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-P3)-sensitive Ca2+ store, whereas the markers of other organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, mitochondria, endosomes) and of the plasma membrane do not. Calciosome might thus be the intracellular target of Ins-P3--i.e., the source of the Ca2+ redistributed to the cytosol following receptor-triggered generation of the messenger.\r"

The anti-trinitrophenyl response of old mice, whose peripheral lymphoid system has been reconstituted from their own bone marrow after irradiation while their bone marrow was partially shielded, includes high-avidity and IgG PFCs relatively comparable to those of normal young mice. If young mice are irradiated while their bone marrow is partially shielded and given purified splenic T cells from either old or young donors during recovery from irradiation, then the avidity distribution and the ratio of IgG/IgM PFCs they produce in response to trinitrophenylated bovine gamma globulin reflects the characteristic immune response of the T-cell donor. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the bone marrows of old and young mice are similar with regard to the spectrum of B-cell clones that they can generate and that it is peripheral regulatory effectors that are responsible for much of the age-related change in the immune response. In addition, if one calculates the PFC avidity distribution taking into account those cells whose secretion of antibody was inhibited by anti-idiotype autoantibodies, then it is clear that there are more high-avidity B cells present in old mice than are detected by the conventional plaque-inhibition assay. Thus, the reduced avidity of the PFC response of old mice appears to be, at least in part, due to down regulation by anti-idiotype autoantibodies.\r"

In an RNA blot-hybridization analysis, this human Hanukah factor cDNA hybridized with a 1.3-kilobase band in allogeneic-stimulated cytotoxic T cells and the Jurkat cell line, but this transcript was not detectable in normal muscle, liver, tonsil, or thymus. By dot-blot hybridization, this cDNA hybridized with RNA from three cytolytic T-cell clones and three noncytolytic T-cell clones grown in vitro as well as with purified CD16+ natural killer cells and CD3+, CD16- T-cell large granular lymphocytes from peripheral blood lymphocytes (CD = cluster designation). The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA clone encodes a predicted serine protease of 262 amino acids. The predicted protein has a 22-amino acid presegment, a 6-amino acid prosegment, and an active enzyme of 234 amino acids with a calculated unglycosylated molecular weight of 25,820. The active enzyme is 71% and 77% similar to the mouse sequence at the amino acid and DNA level, respectively. The human and mouse sequences conserve the active site residues of serine proteases--the trypsin-specific Asp-189 and all 10 cysteine residues. The gene for the human Hanukah factor serine protease is located on human chromosome 5. We propose that this trypsin-like serine protease may function as a common component necessary for lysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.\r"

Therefore, the invariant chain is not required for DR-restricted presentation of measles virus antigens by this fibroblast line. Transfected fibroblasts were lysed as efficiently as an autologous B-cell line even though they expressed much less surface DR antigen. Lysis of both the transfected fibroblasts and the B-cell line was insensitive to treatment with chloroquine. These results demonstrate that expression of a DR alpha beta heterodimer at the surface of this fibroblast line is necessary and sufficient for presentation of measles virus antigens to specific CTL clones.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical forms of leprosy constitute a spectrum that correlates closely with the degree of cell-mediated immunity. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop strong cell-mediated responses and have only a few, localized lesions, whereas patients with multibacillary lepromatous leprosy are specifically unresponsive to antigens of Myobacterium leprae. T cells of the CD4+ subset predominate in tuberculoid lesions, whereas CD8+ cells predominate in lepromatous lesions. Monoclonal antibodies that distinguish subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were used to analyze the distribution of T cells infiltrating lesions across the disease spectrum. In lepromatous lesions, T cells of T-suppressor phenotype (9.3-) were the predominant CD8+ cells and suppressor/inducer cells (2H4+, Leu-8+) represented half of the CD4+ subset. In tuberculoid lesions, helper T cells (CD4+4B4+) outnumbered suppressor/inducer T cells by 14:1, compared with a ratio of 1.2:1 in peripheral blood. Analysis of the precursor frequency of antigen-reactive T cells permitted us to estimate that there was a 100-fold enrichment of T cells able to proliferate in response to M. leprae antigens in tuberculoid lesions (2/100), when compared with blood from the same patients. The methods used here to characterize the T-lymphocyte subsets and frequency of antigen-reactive T cells in leprosy may be useful in analyzing immunological reactions occurring in lesions of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\r"

Oligonucleotide probes derived from this sequence were used to screen a cDNA library prepared from U937 cells. One positive clone was sequenced and contained most of the coding sequence as well as a long incomplete 3' untranslated region (1112 base pairs). This cDNA sequence was shown to encode mPAI-2 by hybrid-select translation. A cDNA clone encoding the remainder of the mPAI-2 mRNA was obtained by primer extension of U937 poly(A)+ RNA using a probe complementary to the mPAI-2 coding region. The coding sequence for mPAI-2 was placed under the control of the lambda PL promoter, and the protein expressed in Escherichia coli formed a complex with urokinase that could be detected immunologically. By nucleotide sequence analysis, mPAI-2 cDNA encodes a protein containing 415 amino acids with a predicted unglycosylated Mr of 46,543. The predicted amino acid sequence of mPAI-2 is very similar to placental PAI-2 (3 amino acid differences) and shows extensive homology with members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. mPAI-2 was found to be more homologous to ovalbumin (37%) than the endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI-1 (26%). Like ovalbumin, mPAI-2 appears to have no typical amino-terminal signal sequence. The 3' untranslated region of the mPAI-2 cDNA contains a putative regulatory sequence that has been associated with the inflammatory mediators.\r"

Expression of the EGF receptor conferred the ability to utilize EGF for transduction of a mitogenic signal. When the transfected cells were propagated in EGF, they exhibited a more mature myeloid phenotype than was observed under conditions of IL-3-directed growth. Moreover, exposure to EGF led to a rapid stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism, while IL-3 had no detectable effect on phosphoinositide turnover either in control or EGF receptor-transfected 32D cells. Although the transfected cells exhibited high levels of functional EGF receptors, they remained nontumorigenic. In contrast, transfection of v-erbB, an amino-terminal truncated form of the EGF receptor with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, not only abrogated the IL-3 growth factor requirement of 32D cells, but caused them to become tumorigenic in nude mice. These results show that a naive hematopoietic cell expresses all of the intracellular components of the EGF-signaling pathway necessary to evoke a mitogenic response and sustain continuous proliferation.\r"

One class of potassium channel (type n) predominates in immature thymocyte subsets as well as in mature-phenotype CD4+CD8- thymocytes (precursors to helper T lymphocytes), and the average surface density of this channel type correlates with the extent of cell proliferation. Two additional types of potassium channels (types n' and l) are found in the mature CD4-CD8+ thymocyte subset that contains precursors to cytotoxic and suppressor T cells.

The MMSE is a 30-point cognitive function screening instrument for dementia and delirium. These patients were compared with 22 matched control subjects who exhibited intact cognitive function postoperatively. The study assessed the association between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and socioeconomic status, potential effects of selected surgical/anesthetic factors, and preoperative anxiety and depression (Zung Anxiety and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression [CES-D] self-rating scales). The results indicate that a higher preoperative level of depression reported on the CES-D (mean score of study patients 22.1 versus 12.7 for controls) is significantly associated with the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (P less than .01). The educational and occupational levels of study patients were significantly below those of controls (P less than .01, P less than .02). Occurrence of a postoperative complication was the only surgical/anesthetic factor found to be significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction (P less than .01). These findings suggest that preoperative depression significantly increases the risk for immediate postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and that lower socioeconomic status may confer greater risk for postoperative cognitive morbidity.\r"

We present data that show that cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) is also increased by cimetidine in normal and down-regulated murine splenocytes. Timed addition and removal of cimetidine from CMC generation cultures localizes the cimetidine effect to the first 24 hours of the alloantigen sensitization process. Cimetidine partially reverses CMC suppression by suppressor cells generated in vitro in a dose response manner; the result depends on the number of suppressor cells added. Mixed tumor lymphocyte cytotoxicity of splenocytes from syngeneic-tumor-bearing mice is increased by in vivo cimetidine treatment, which results in prolongation of concomitant tumor immunity. These data support the concept that cimetidine may have potential as a clinical immunofacilitator in down-regulated states of immunity.\r"

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was tested under flowing conditions in culture media or in blood supplemented with the virus. Hematoporphyrin derivative was used as the sensitizer and was photoactivated with visible light at 630 nm and 5 J/cm2. HSV-1 in suspension both in culture medium as well as in blood was shown to be killed. The human immunodeficiency virus was also found to be photoinactivated in flowing cell culture medium and, thus, potentially may be inactivated in blood. These findings extend our previous studies which demonstrated that enveloped viruses can be photoinactivated with hematoporphyrin derivative in a static fluid system. Analysis of blood cell number, red cell lysis, plasma proteins, and other standard hematological tests showed no significant change. The possibility that transfusion-associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may result from a blood unit infected with human immunodeficiency virus that tested negative makes it imperative that a safe and effective means of viral killing be developed. The system reported here offers promise as an effective approach to this problem.\r"

  ".W": "Anatomic structures that move periodically during the acquisition of data for an MR image become multiple ghosts in the phase-encoding direction. There is a constant spacing in pixels between consecutive ghosts, which is equal to the number of cycles of motion that occurred during the acquisition of data. The intensity of ghosts depends on the intensity of the moving structure and the number of pixels over which the motion occurred. No single method is completely satisfactory at suppressing motion artifacts. The major attributes and limitations of each method are summarized in Table 2, with plus (+) signs denoting merit. Theoretically, some methods perform better in reducing the intensity of ghosts and restoring the image intensity to its proper place. This certainly is not the final criterion, however. Some methods reduce the blurring in addition to suppressing the ghosts, or they suppress ghosts without prolonging the time for imaging. Certain methods also reduce ghosts from other kinds of motion. It is very appealing for a method to function without monitoring. The success of monitoring often depends too much on the cooperation of both the patient and technologist. The theoretical performance, attributes, and deficiencies of the various methods have been combined into a subjective overall rating in the last column of Table 2. All of the methods can be effective under the appropriate circumstances. Moreover, the methods are not mutually exclusive. It is advantageous, therefore, to combine methods to achieve even greater suppression. For example, physical restraint can be used for all but the most uncooperative patients. Most imaging techniques can be designed with gradients that rephase the signals from moving structures. Then other methods, such as averaging or reordering, can be applied as necessary. Fortunately, there are effective motion artifact suppression methods, even though not all are widely available yet on commercial equipment. Consistent suppression of motion artifacts will enhance the quality of MR images. Elimination of motion artifacts will improve the capability of MR to detect lesions and will provide a higher standard of performance for MR in the body.\r"

  ".W": "The capability of rapid (cine) MR imaging to quantitate left ventricular function was assessed in 13 normal subjects and in 15 patients with ischemic heart disease and regional wall-motion abnormalities proved by echocardiography and/or by contrast ventriculography. Fifteen to 20 MR images/cardiac cycle were acquired by using partial flip angles, short repetition times, and gradient-refocused echoes. Regional wall motion was assessed qualitatively in the equatorial left ventricular section by using the cine display and quantitatively by measuring myocardial thickness at end-diastole and at end-systole in six left ventricular segments in this plane. In normal volunteers wall motion was normal in all segments. Heterogeneity of systolic wall thickening was observed in normal subjects, ranging from 33% +/- 17% in the posteroseptal segment to 66% +/- 29% in the posterior segment. Overall systolic wall thickening was 48% +/- 28%. From the cinematic display of MR images, abnormal wall motion was observed in 40 of 90 segments in patients with ischemic heart disease, which correlated well with results of echocardiography or contrast ventriculography. Twenty-one segments were hypokinetic, 15 were akinetic, and four were dyskinetic. In patients with ischemic heart disease, percentage systolic wall thickening was 43% +/- 31% in the segments with normal wall motion, 6% +/- 18% in hypokinetic segments, -4% +/- 24% in akinetic segments, and -13% +/- 25% in dyskinetic zones. Absolute systolic wall thickening was less than 2 mm in 31 of 40 abnormal segments and was greater than 2 mm in only three. Rapid acquisition, improved temporal resolution, and the capacity for cine display make this new MR technique potentially useful not only for qualitative assessment of cardiac wall motion, but also for quantification of regional myocardial function.\r"

To determine its value in humans, we studied five patients 2-17 days after myocardial infarction by using ECG-gated MR before and after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA. One patient had a rupture of the interventricular septum, complicating an acute inferior-wall infarction. Spin-echo images were obtained before and immediately after injection of Gd-DTPA and were repeated every 10 min for up to 40 min. In four patients, intensity-vs-time curves revealed increasing signal intensity in the infarcted area in the first 20 min after injection of gadolinium. Contrast between normal and infarcted myocardium was greatest 20-30 min after Gd-DTPA injection. In one patient, increasing signal intensity of the infarcted myocardium was observed up to 40 min after Gd-DTPA injection. The precontrast intensity ratio between infarcted and normal myocardium was 1.1 at echo time (TE) = 30 msec and was 1.4 at TE = 60 msec (p less than .05). The postcontrast intensity ratio was 1.6, which was not statistically different from the ratio at TE = 60 msec but which was significantly higher than the ratio at TE = 30 msec (p less than .01). Infarct definition was substantially improved on postcontrast images. The septal rupture was clearly seen, and the infarcted myocardium surrounding the septal rupture showed enhancement on postcontrast images. These results suggest that Gd-DTPA can improve MR visualization and detection of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

All four patients presented with hemoptysis. All four had a chest radiograph, which in two showed the aneurysm and in three showed airspace disease adjacent to the aorta. The aneurysm was shown by CT in one of two patients and by aortography in two of three patients. Neither CT nor aortography showed the fistula. Aortobronchopulmonary fistula was proved by surgery in two of the patients and by autopsy in the other two. A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of aortobronchopulmonary fistula. The diagnosis should be considered in patients who have minor or major hemoptysis, with either coexisting thoracic aortic aneurysms or history of thoracic aneurysm repair.\r"

The two techniques were evaluated in a clinical study of 135 patients with suspected chest abnormalities. Photofluorographs and film-screen chest radiographs were interpreted independently by three radiologists. The diagnoses were confirmed by CT, follow-up radiographs, and clinical records. Among the 135 patients, 75 had primary lung cancer, 39 had pulmonary nodules, 52 had hilar or mediastinal abnormalities, 17 had pleural fluid, and 45 had pneumonic or atelectatic changes. Twenty-three normal subjects were included. Differences in diagnostic accuracy, measured by sensitivity and specificity, were not statistically significant. A larger number of true-positive cases (65%) with peripheral lung nodules were found by photofluorography than by film-screen radiography (54%) (p less than .05). The results suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of chest images made by photofluorography is sufficient to warrant using it instead of the film-screen technique in routine chest radiography, especially to detect lung tumors and metastases.\r"

On chest films, the Eloesser window characteristically appeared en face as an elliptical or crescent-shaped radiolucency with sharp superior and ill-defined inferior margins. It appeared in profile as a downward-sloping chest-wall defect with round superior and straight inferior margins. The first radiographs made after surgery often showed potentially confusing densities caused by the iodinated gauze used to pack the drained empyema cavity. On sequential chest films, the defect in the chest wall was always detectable, while the pleural cavity diminished in size and usually disappeared within 6 months. This analysis shows that the postoperative chest radiographs and CT scans in patients having the Eloesser window thoracostomy have features that are characteristic of the procedure.\r"

With an animal model of hepatic metastases from breast cancer, IV administration of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg) shows a biphasic time response, transiently increasing the signal intensity of liver relative to tumor, with C/N ratio magnitudes increasing from -5.7 to -16.3 (SE 250/20); after a delay, the signal intensity of tumor increases relative to liver with a reversal of the C/N sign from negative to positive and an increase in the C/N magnitude to +25.0. IV administration of ferrite particles (0.05 mmol Fe/kg) shows a monophasic time response, increasing signal intensity of tumor relative to liver from +1.5 to +49.5 (SE 500/30). When both contrast agents were administered together (dual-contrast technique), the tumor-liver C/N magnitude reached a maximum of +67.8 (SE 500/30) 12 min after drug infusion. Analysis of individual contrast and noise factors contributing to this technique revealed a strong correlation between the signal intensity of liver and the signal intensity of ghost artifacts, which increase after administration of Gd-DTPA (r = .89) and decrease after administration of ferrite (r = 1.0). Dual-contrast imaging shows a synergistic addition of contrast and suppression of noise from ghost artifacts, maximizing the C/N and increasing the conspicuity of focal liver lesions.\r"

No statistically significant correlation was found between T1 and iron content at either field strength. The variation of the 1/T2 with interecho interval may be useful for measuring iron content in vivo.

  ".W": "The occurrence rate of renal cell carcinoma is significantly higher in the native kidneys of patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis than in kidneys of normal subjects. These carcinomas may be difficult to detect because these kidneys tend to be small and distorted owing to acquired cystic disease. Four cases of renal cell carcinoma detected by CT are presented (three in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, and one in a patient with a functioning transplant who had history of dialysis). All kidneys had extensive acquired cystic disease. In two cases, contrast-enhanced scans showed a solid lesion of lower density than the kidney. In another case, in which IV contrast material could not be given, the mass was of higher density than the kidney and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was present. In the fourth case, no distinct solid mass could be identified. The only sign of malignancy in this case was extensive lymphadenopathy. Whenever CT examination of the abdomen is performed in a patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the kidneys must be evaluated carefully because of the increased frequency of renal cell carcinoma. In a few cases, a distinct solid lesion may not be apparent or may be subtle owing to distortion of renal anatomy by acquired cystic disease.\r"

In three patients, total occlusion of the malformations was accomplished by ablation of two arterial branches. In the remaining four patients, the malformations were partially occluded by ablation of one or two arterial branches. In addition to ablation with alcohol, two of the four patients underwent subselective embolization with Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge) under epinephrine pharmacoangiography, which resulted in the disappearance of the remaining malformations. None of the patients had serious complications from ablation with alcohol, although dyspnea and headache occurred in one patient with marked arteriovenous shunting. During long-term follow-ups, hematuria disappeared in six patients. In the remaining patient hematuria recurred but did not require treatment. These data suggest that alcohol ablation is useful and safe in the treatment of renal arteriovenous malformations.\r"

CT can be useful in making this distinction. We present five cases of circumcaval ureter in which contrast-enhanced CT, by showing the ureter passing posterior and medial to the inferior vena cava (IVC), provided the definitive diagnosis. In addition, we studied the position of the inferior vena cava in the midlumbar region in 100 consecutive contrast-enhanced CT scans and compared the results with the position of the IVC in our five cases of circumcaval ureter plus one case of circumcaval ureter taken from the literature. Whereas only 6% of the normal patients had an IVC lateral to the right pedicle of the third lumbar vertebra, all of the patients with a circumcaval ureter and the one case in the literature had the IVC lateral to the pedicle. Therefore, the finding of a laterally placed IVC on CT is suggestive but not pathognomonic of circumcaval ureter. Contrast-enhanced CT can be used to prove the diagnosis of circumcaval ureter, and lateral placement of the IVC on non-contrast-enhanced CT suggests the diagnosis.\r"

Arthroscopic confirmation was available in all cases and was the standard for comparison. Thirteen of these extremities were also examined by using a two-dimensional Fourier transform spin-echo pulse sequence with a 2000-msec repetition time and 20- and 80-msec echo time. In these 13 cases, both pulse sequences correctly identified seven of eight meniscal abnormalities. However, interpretation of the 3DFT GRASS images resulted in fewer false-positive meniscal tears (three vs six). Cruciate ligament tears were detected more readily on the 3DFT GRASS images (six vs three with two possible tears on the spin-echo images). These preliminary findings suggest that the overall accuracy of MR imaging of the knee could be improved by including 3DFT gradient-refocused pulse sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Bone scans are highly sensitive for the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis, but the difficulty of separating bone-marrow processes from soft-tissue disease limits the specificity and accuracy. A diagnostic technique capable of distinguishing bone-marrow processes from soft-tissue disease would improve the diagnostic accuracy of osteomyelitis. To evaluate the use of MR in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, MR examinations were performed in 35 patients with suspected acute osteomyelitis. Twelve of these were proved to have osteomyelitis either by surgery (nine patients) or by clinical follow-up (three patients). In the other 23, osteomyelitis was excluded by surgery (12 patients) or by the clinical course (11 patients). Evidence of osteomyelitis on MR consisted of abnormalities of the bone marrow with decreased signal intensity on the T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted or short-T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images. MR and bone scintigraphy were interpreted by two radiologists who were given no clinical information other than to rule out osteomyelitis. The sensitivities of MR and static bone scan were 100% for bone-marrow abnormality. Because bone-marrow abnormality in osteomyelitis associated with healing fractures was incorrectly diagnosed by MR (one case) and bone scintigraphy (two cases), the sensitivities of MR and scintigraphy for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis were 92% and 82%, respectively. The specificities of MR and scintigraphy were 96% and 65%, respectively (p less than .05). The overall accuracy for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was 94% for MR and 71% for bone scan (p less than .05). Because of its ability to separate soft-tissue disease from underlying bone marrow, MR may be used to evaluate patients with positive bone scintigraphy to improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis for osteomyelitis.\r"

For correct determination of prognosis and therapy, the presence and extent of the abnormality must be assessed accurately. CT findings in 18 patients with 22 pseudarthroses were compared with the results of conventional tomography. The condition was confirmed by surgery in nine patients (50%). CT scans clearly characterized the pseudarthrosis, providing data not provided by conventional tomography in 17 (77%) of the 22 lesions. CT showed irregular diskovertebral osteolysis with reactive sclerosis and more frequently detected the vacuum phenomenon and paraspinal swellings. In all cases, CT showed either a fracture of mobile facet joints in the posterior elements and allowed clear differentiation between the two. In four cases, such differentiation was impossible on conventional tomograms. Associated spinal stenosis was suspected on conventional tomograms in three lesions, but it was shown clearly by CT in 10 lesions. Our results suggest that CT offers considerable advantages over conventional tomography in the investigation of spinal pseudarthrosis complicating ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

Tumor resection, performed by using either en bloc excision or amputation in all patients, allowed detailed pathologic verification of imaging findings. Image analysis included measurement of maximum tumor dimensions, notation of tumor position in relation to deep fascia, recording of anatomic compartment and individual muscle involvement, and documentation of the spatial relationships between tumor, neurovascular structures, underlying bones, and joints. MR and CT were equally accurate in measurement of maximal tumor diameter, detection of tumor depth, and delineation of tumor, neurovascular, osseous, and articular relationships. Evaluation of anatomic compartment and individual muscle involvement was more accurately accomplished with MR imaging; nine (23%) of 40 MR studies showed tumor involvement of one or more individual muscles that appeared normal in CT scans. These results suggest that MR imaging may be the staging procedure of choice in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities.\r"

  ".W": "Rib fractures frequently are encountered in abused infants and commonly occur in the posterior rib arcs. Fractures occurring near the costovertebral articulations are rarely identified radiographically in the acute phase, and callus formation usually is the first indication of injury. To assess the factors influencing the visibility of fractures near the costovertebral articulations in abused infants, 103 posterior rib fractures occurring in 16 abused infants were studied radiologically. The plain radiologic studies were correlated with the pathologic findings in 15 ribs from four patients. The limited visibility of fractures relates to (1) the frequent superimposition of the transverse process over the rib fracture site, (2) a fracture line that crosses at an obliquity to the radiographic beam, and (3) nondisplacement of rib fragments due to preservation of the posterior periosteum. Fresh fractures invisible on a frontal projection are clearly defined when the rib is viewed axially with postmortem radiography. These findings explain the reported superior sensitivity of radionuclide bone scans vs radiography in the identification of fresh posterior rib fractures. A knowledge of the factors influencing the visibility of these important injuries is useful in planning an appropriate diagnostic evaluation in cases of suspected infant abuse.\r"

Most dilatations were performed on an outpatient basis without anesthesia. All strictures responded immediately to dilatation. In most cases, long-term resolution occurred after three or fewer procedures. A subgroup of patients was identified in which a prolonged course of treatment was needed. These included patients with long strictures due to esophageal atresia, patients with chronic severe esophagitis, and patients with strictures at the site of esophageal perforation. No significant complications were encountered. Balloon dilatation of esophageal stenosis in children is effective and safe and should be considered before other methods of treatment are used.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients underwent MR imaging at 0.5 T within 7 days of a CT-documented intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 57 hematomas were evaluated. Twelve patients underwent serial scanning and 12 patients had multiple hemorrhages into different intracranial compartments. The appearances of the hematomas on spin-echo (SE) images with a short repetition time (TR) of 500 msec and short echo time (TE) of 32 msec (SE 500/32), long TR/intermediate TE (SE 2000/60), and long TR/long TE (SE 2000/120) were carefully evaluated with specific attention to the precise time after ictus. Hematomas showed heterogeneous, complex, rapidly changing intensities. There was a significant amount of variation among patients, especially between the third and seventh days. Hematomas studied between 12 and 24 hr after hemorrhage were mildly hyperintense on short TR scans and markedly hyperintense on long TR (intermediate and long TE) scans (stage I). These findings in acute hemorrhage have received little prior attention. Over the next 1-2 days, hematomas became iso- to mildly hypointense on short TR scans and markedly hypointense on long TR scans (stage II). Hypointensity on long TR scans has previously been described at high field strengths; our communication demonstrates that this phenomenon is seen routinely at intermediate field strengths as well. Hematomas became markedly hyperintense on short TR scans beginning on approximately the fourth day postictus and redeveloped hyperintensity on long TR scans approximately 5-6 days after ictus (stage III). By the end of the first week they were hyperintense on all pulse sequences (stage IV). MR findings on the first day after intracranial hemorrhage (in particular, subtle hyperintensity on short TR scans) probably allow for a specific diagnosis, while the variable, hetergeneous, and rapidly changing intensities noted between days 2 and 7 are often less specific.\r"

  ".U": "88130548\r", 
  ".W": "The distribution and extent of traumatic lesions were prospectively evaluated with MR imaging in 40 patients with closed head injuries. Primary intraaxial lesions were classified according to their distinctive topographical distribution within the brain and were of four main types: (1) diffuse axonal injury (48.2%), (2) cortical contusion (43.7%), (3) subcortical gray-matter injury (4.5%), and (4) primary brainstem injury (3.6%). Diffuse axonal injury most commonly involved the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and the corona radiata. Cortical contusions most frequently involved the inferior, lateral, and anterior aspects of the frontal and temporal lobes. Primary brainstem lesions were most commonly seen in the dorsolateral aspects of the rostral brainstem. The pattern and distribution of primary lesions seen by MR were compared with those expected from previous pathologic studies and found to be quite similar. Our data and review of the literature would also indicate that MR detects a more complete spectrum of traumatic lesions than does CT. Secondary forms of injury (territorial arterial infarction, pressure necrosis from increased intracranial pressure, cerebral herniation, secondary brainstem injury) were also visible by MR in some cases. The level of consciousness was most impaired in patients with primary brainstem injury, followed by those with widespread diffuse axonal injury and subcortical gray-matter injury. The best MR imaging planes, pulse sequences, and imaging strategies for evaluating and classifying traumatic lesions were evaluated, and the mechanisms by which traumatic stresses result in injury were reviewed. MR was found to be superior to CT and to be very effective in the detection of traumatic head lesions and some secondary forms of injury. While T2-weighted images were most useful for lesion detection, T1-weighted images proved to be most useful for anatomic localization and classification.\r"

  ".U": "88130549\r", 
  ".W": "Forty patients with closed head trauma were evaluated prospectively with CT and intermediate-field-strength MR imaging to compare the diagnostic efficacies of the two techniques. Traumatic lesions were detected in 38 patients. The severity of injury, as determined by the Glascow Coma Scale, ranged from 3 to 14. The sensitivities of CT and MR were calculated for all subgroups of lesions: (1) hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic intraaxial lesions (diffuse axonal injury, cortical contusion, subcortical gray-matter injury, primary brainstem injury); (2) extraaxial hematomas (subdural, epidural); and (3) diffuse hemorrhage (subarachnoid, intraventricular). CT and MR (T1- and T2-weighted) studies were both highly and comparably sensitive in the detection of hemorrhagic intraaxial lesions. MR scans, however, were much more sensitive in detecting nonhemorrhagic lesions. cortical contusions and diffuse axonal injury constituted 91.9% of all intraaxial lesions. The sensitivities of the imaging techniques for this combined group of lesions were (1) nonhemorrhagic lesions (CT = 17.7%, T1-weighted MR = 67.6%, T2-weighted MR = 93.3%); (2) hemorrhagic lesions (CT = 89.8%, T1-weighted MR = 87.1%, T2-weighted MR = 92.5%). MR was also significantly better in detecting brainstem lesions (CT = 9.1%, T1-weighted MR = 81.8%, T2-weighted MR = 72.7%). The sensitivities of the diagnostic studies in the detection of extraaxial hematomas were CT = 73.2%, T1-weighted MR = 97.6%, T2-weighted MR = 90.5%). Intraventricular hemorrhage was consistently seen with all three imaging studies, but subarachnoid hemorrhage was detected much more frequently with CT. In summary, MR has clear advantages over CT in evaluating closed head trauma. Although its sensitivity in detecting hemorrhagic lesions is similar to that of CT, it is much better than CT in detecting nonhemorrhagic lesions, which are more prevalent. MR is more useful than CT in classifying primary and secondary forms of injury and directing treatment. CT's one advantage over MR is its ability to more rapidly assess unstable patients who may need surgery.\r"

The use of a 10 degrees flip angle with a TR of 75 msec and TE of 12.3 msec consistently provided good contrast and signal-to-noise ratio, giving a CT myelographic effect. The use of both axial and sagittal LFA images was important for optimal detection of extradural defects and for distinction of herniated disk versus osteophyte. There was excellent correlation between the MR and surgical findings. Our results suggest that MR imaging is the initial procedure of choice for the evaluation of suspected cervical radiculopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients with chronic stable angina were studied before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to assess the prevalence and prognostic implications of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia obtained by ambulatory monitoring. Ambulatory monitoring performed during medical therapy before CABG detected 66 episodes of transient ischemia, 54 (82%) being asymptomatic. All patients were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms 3 months after CABG. Additional ambulatory monitoring was performed for 36 hours. There were 39 episodes of silent ischemia detected in the 12 patients of group 1, whereas no episodes of ST-segment shift occurred in the 24 patients of group 2. Coronary artery bypass grafting reduced the frequency of transient ischemia by 41% (p less than 0.05) compared with medical therapy, whereas the number of ischemic episodes in group 1 increased from 23 during medical therapy to 39 episodes after CABG (41%, p less than 0.05). During a follow-up of 9 months, 8 cardiac events occurred: 6 in group 1 comprising sudden death (1), revascularization (2), and angina (3) and 2 in group 2, including revascularization (1) and angina (1) (p = 0.005). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that asymptomatic myocardial ischemia was correlated with a significant cumulative probability of cardiac events (p less than 0.025) and multivariate analysis of 11 variables showed that silent ischemia was the most powerful predictor of cardiac events (p less than 0.005). Silent ischemia was a forerunner for angina pectoris in some patients, whereas angina did not occur during the follow-up period in others. This study does not reveal whether or not these patients are at higher risk for cardiac events during long-term follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-three patients with angina pectoris and 20 with atypical chest pain, who underwent coronary angiography, were examined by single-photon emission computed thallium tomography (TI-SPECT) using a combined dipyridamole-handgrip stress test. Perfusion defects were detected in 78 of 81 patients with angiographically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) (sensitivity 96%). In 9 of 12 patients without CAD, the thallium images were normal (specificity 75%). Thirty-five patients with CAD were reexamined by TI-SPECT using a dynamic bicycle exercise stress test. The sensitivity of the dipyridamole-handgrip test did not differ from the bicycle exercise test in diagnosing the CAD (97% vs 94%). Multiple thallium defects were seen in 19 of 22 (86%) patients with multivessel CAD by the dipyridamole-handgrip test but only in 14 of 22 (64%) by the bicycle exercise test. Noncardiac side-effects occurred in 17 of 93 (18%) patients after dipyridamole infusion. Cardiac symptoms were less common during the dipyridamole-handgrip test than during the bicycle exercise (15% vs 76%, p less than 0.01). These data suggest that the dipyridamole-handgrip test is a useful alternative stress method for thallium perfusion imaging, particularly in detecting multivessel CAD.\r"

  ".W": "Because left ventricular (LV) diastolic function is abnormal in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), pulsed Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate LV filling before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Filling was evaluated by Doppler in 2 studies: (1) in a group of 41 unpaired patients (11 with angiographically normal coronary arteries, 14 with CAD but without CABG and 16 at 1 week after CABG) and (2) in a group of 12 patients with CAD before and 1 week after CABG. Doppler sampling at the level of the mitral anulus was analyzed for the deceleration half-time and for the ratio of peak late (A) to peak early (E) filling velocity, measures reflecting early ventricular filling and the relative contribution of atrial contraction to ventricular filling. In the first study the deceleration half-time was significantly prolonged in both CAD and CABG groups. The late to early peak transmitral velocity ratio, however, was significantly prolonged only in the nonrevascularized CAD patients. In the second group of CAD patients studied before and 1 week after surgical revascularization, both the late to early peak transmitral velocity ratio and the deceleration half-time showed significant postoperative improvement. Thus, patients with CAD showed impairment in early LV filling and a compensatory increase in the proportion of filling with active atrial contraction. Successful CABG appears to result in normalization of early filling and decreased reliance on active atrial transport.\r"

This antibody recognizes an unsialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose III (hapen X) carbohydrate moiety that is linked to the cell membrane protein in interdigitating reticulum cells and Langerhans' cells. Previously, the authors have shown that anti-Leu-M1 can be used to stain Reed-Sternberg cells, which are likely related to interdigitating reticulum cells. In this study, the authors tested the usefulness of anti-Leu-M1 in staining formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections from eight patients with histiocytosis X. For staining of histiocytosis X cells, unlike Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease, neuraminidase treatment was required for removal of sialic acid residues from the Leu-M1 antigen. The staining characteristics of anti-Leu-M1 in histiocytosis X cells resembled those of normal Langerhans' cells and lymphocyte and histiocyte variants (L & H cells) in the lymphocyte-predominant type of Hodgkin's disease. The significance of sialylation of Leu-M1 antigen in histiocytosis X cells has yet to be determined in order to correlate the prognosis of the disease. The authors suggest that anti-Leu-M1 used together with neuraminidase treatment is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of histiocytosis X when electron microscopy or frozen sections for OKT6 immunostaining are not available.\r"

Factors that may have caused the separation of our two groups and the high prevalence of MAI are addressed herein.

No statistically significant differences in IgG titer were observed between controls and patients invasively examined for P carinii, whether the organism was observed in the specimen or not. Since 38% of all serum samples referred were derived from \"blood-borne\" cases of AIDS, including patients who contracted AIDS as a result of both transfusion and hemophilia A, this suggests that P carinii pneumonia or P carinii pneumonia- like pneumonias may be more common in these individuals.\r"

Crude supernatants from concanavalin-activated cloned T cells were fractionated by gel filtration, ion exchange, or reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. FsF has an apparent molecular weight of 17,000 and could be differentiated from colony-stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interferon (IFN) on the basis of chromatographic characteristics. Highly purified or recombinant IL-2, IL-3, CSF, and IFN had no significant effect on fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, a monoclonal anti-B-cell-stimulating factor-1 antibody only partially blocked the fibroblast proliferation induced by T-cell supernatants.\r"

Eccentric intimal thickening often accompanied by intimal mononuclear cell infiltration was commonly observed in sections of the lower thoracic aorta. These changes were usually related to intercostal branching sites and thus greater in the dorsal (posterior) than on the ventral aspect of the aorta in 64 of 75 cases examined. In some of these samples the authors were able to demonstrate the presence of T lymphocytes and monocyte-macrophages (mono/macs) by the use of the monoclonal antibodies T11 and Leu-M5, respectively. Many of the T lymphocytes were T8-positive and thus of the cytotoxic/suppressor subtype. T4-positive cells of the inducer/helper subtype were seen occasionally. T cells of both T4 and T8 subsets and mono/macs were also demonstrated in areas of eccentric intimal thickening in coronary arteries and in raised coronary lesions. In both the aortas and the coronary lesions the T cells and mono/macs were often closely associated with one another. This finding is of interest in view of the well-known cell-regulatory and cytotoxic potential of these cells. Extrapolating from findings in non-human primates, the authors suggest a potential role for mononuclear cells in human atherogenesis.\r"
