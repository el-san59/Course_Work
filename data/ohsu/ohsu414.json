Alz-50, anti-ubiquitin and Tau-1 immunostained the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and the neuritic component of plaques, both in Alzheimer's disease and in the brains of patients without dementia, but extraneuronal tangles were largely unstained. These antibodies also reacted with Pick bodies, and with the neurofibrillary tangles of Kufs' disease and Guam Parkinsonism-dementia. In sections from the brain of a patient with progressive supranuclear palsy, virtually all of the tangles were immunostained with Tau-1 but only a few with Alz-50 or anti-ubiquitin. Anti-ubiquitin also labelled Lewy bodies and the inclusions of granulovacuolar degeneration. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots of homogenized frontal cortex showed significantly more Alz-50 antigen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's and Pick's disease than in controls. The level of this antigen was increased both in the crude homogenates and in the cytosolic fraction. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was increased only in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and then only in the crude homogenates. The finding that antigenic determinants for Alz-50, anti-ubiquitin and Tau-1 are shared by several filamentous neuronal inclusions occurring in diverse neurologic disorders may reflect common metabolic defects underlying the formation of these inclusions, or common metabolic responses to their presence.\r"

The overall rate of fluid administration was inversely correlated with the time of onset of herniation (r = -0.32, p = 0.04). Only 4 of 40 cases occurred at fluid intakes less than or equal to 4.0 L/m2/day. During treatment, \"calculated\" serum sodium concentrations fell significantly and were less than 130 mEq/L in 33% of cases at the time of herniation. These data indicate that excessive secretion of vasopressin may exacerbate the brain edema, and that limitation of the rate of fluid administration may be prudent.\r"

  ".U": "88258895\r", 
  ".W": "Zolpidem is a novel hypnotic drug which possesses preferential affinity, under in vitro conditions, for the omega 1 (BZD1) subtype of BZD binding sites. In the present study the in vivo interaction of zolpidem with mouse brain BZD binding sites, as labeled by i.v. injection of [3H]Ro 15-1788, has been investigated. Intraperitoneal administration of zolpidem (30 min before sacrifice) decreased in a dose-dependent manner, the retention of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in the cerebral cortex (ED50 = 8.9 mg/kg i.p.); the inhibition by zolpidem was maximal (70%) at 5 to 10 min postinjection and of only 10% 1 hr later. These kinetics are in agreement with its short lasting hypnotic properties. CGS 9896, CL 218,872 and flunitrazepam also prevented the cortical accumulation of [3H]Ro 15-1788 with ED50 values of 12.5, 24 and 0.17 mg/kg i.p., respectively. Zolpidem, like flunitrazepam, diminishes exploratory activity and possesses anticonvulsant and myorelaxant effects in the mouse. However, in contrast to flunitrazepam, the sedative action of zolpidem can be evidenced at a much lower recognition site occupancy (35%) than that needed for myorelaxant or anticonvulsant effects (50-56%). The regional selectivity of zolpidem as an inhibitor of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vitro and in vivo binding in the mouse brain has been assessed by quantitative autoradiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We reported previously that cold exposure increases by 2- to 3-times the maximal responsiveness of interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) adenylate cyclase to stimulation by norepinephrine or fluoride and that the sensitizing effect of cold is the result of an increase in neural transmission to the tissue because it is abolished by prior surgical denervation of IBAT. The present report examined further the molecular basis of the sensitization of IBAT adenylate cyclase. Cold exposure increased the maximal responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to stimulation by guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate without altering the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the nucleotide. In addition, cold exposure increased the maximal extent of cholera toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Gs alpha) in proportion to the increase in adenylate cyclase activity, but did not alter pertussis toxin-mediated labeling of the inhibitory regulatory protein. Direct measurement of Gs alpha by immunoblotting, however, revealed that sensitized membranes did not contain more Gs alpha protein. These results indicate that neural stimulation of IBAT produced by cold exposure alters the proportion of existing Gs molecules that are functional. The additional observation that sensitized adenylate cyclase activity did not reconstitute into cyc- S-49 lymphoma membranes suggests that the ability of neural stimulation to increase Gs function in IBAT might depend upon the interaction of Gs with factors that are unique to membranes of cold-exposed rats.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that exposing rats to cold increases interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) adenylate cyclase activity through a postreceptor modification of the adenylate cyclase system. The cold-induced sensitization is correlated with an increase in the activity of the sympathetic innervation of IBAT, and is prevented by prior surgical denervation of this tissue. The present experiments were aimed at identifying the neurogenic signal that mediates cold-induced sensitization. We found that, like cold exposure, infusions of norepinephrine increased adenylate cyclase activity and enhanced the ability of cholera toxin to ADP-ribosylate the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Gs) in warm-adapted rats whose IBAT had been denervated surgically. Infusions of isoproterenol increased adenylate cyclase responsiveness more potently than norepinephrine; however, the maximal effect achieved by isoproterenol was less than that produced by norepinephrine. Infusions of phenylephrine and clonidine had no effect on adenylate cyclase responsiveness. The effects of low doses of isoproterenol, however, were greatly potentiated by coinfusion of phenylephrine. Furthermore, the sensitizing effects of norepinephrine could be blocked by either propranolol or prazosin, indicating that the effects of norepinephrine require simultaneous stimulation of beta and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88258903\r", 
  ".W": "The rabbit hydronephrotic kidney (HNK) is a model of renal inflammation characterized by a marked increase in arachidonic acid metabolism which is temporally associated with an inflammatory cell influx into the injured tissue. The HNK exhibits an exaggerated elaboration of eicosanoids ex vivo in response to inflammatory agonists (bradykinin and the chemotactic peptide, n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine). Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency [i.e., deprivation of (n-6) fatty acids] attenuated markedly the ex vivo elaboration of eicosanoids and prevented the enhancement of the microsomal cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase activity associated with 3 days of ureter occlusion. In contrast, postobstructive release prevented the ex vivo elaboration of eicosanoids by the HNK. When the HNK was assessed morphologically by electron microscopy, both EFA deficiency and postobstructive release markedly reduced the population of interstitial macrophages normally seen in the HNK. Apparently, EFA deficiency blocked the influx of macrophages whereas postobstructive release resulted in the efflux of macrophages from the HNK. Because EFA deficiency has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of leukotriene B4, a potential chemotaxin, it was hypothesized that EFA deficiency might prevent the influx of macrophages due to an inhibition of leukotriene B4 synthesis. Indeed, EFA deficiency suppressed the synthesis of this eicosanoid in blood whereas prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 production were unaffected. In summary, this study demonstrates that EFA deficiency prevents the influx of macrophages into the HNK and prevents the enhanced arachidonate metabolism which normally occurs after ureter obstruction. A potential role for leukotriene B4 as a chemotactic agent in this model of renal inflammation also is suggested.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to investigate the role of APAP metabolism in this potentiation. Administration of RA (50 mg/kg p.o.) to male Fischer 344 rats 30 min before [3H]APAP (750 mg/kg p.o.) increased the plasma concentrations of acetaminophen at 2 hr (193%) and 4 hr (277%) after APAP. Covalent binding of [3H]APAP-related material to hepatic macromolecules in RA-pretreated animals was similar to APAP alone values up to 12 hr after treatment; however, 24 hr after APAP, binding in the RA-pretreated animals was twice that observed in animals given [3H]APAP alone. Urinary excretion (0-24 hr) of APAP and APAP glucuronide were reduced in ranitidine-pretreated animals to 64 and 66% of control, respectively, indicating that in vivo RA altered APAP conjugation with glucuronic acid. APAP uridine diphosphoglucuronyltransferase activity in rat hepatic microsomes was competitively inhibited by RA (0.1-2 mM). The Ki apparent for RA inhibition of APAP uridine diphosphoglucuronyltransferase was 0.04 mM. In contrast, neither APAP nor 4-nitrophenol sulfotransferase activity in rat hepatic cytosol was inhibited by RA at concentrations up to 5 mM. Together, these results support the suggestion that RA-mediated alterations of APAP conjugation may explain the potentiation of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by RA in rats.\r"

The effects of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) on anterior pituitary hormone plasma levels after alcohol (2.5 and 3.5 g/kg) or sucrose control administration were studied in 10 normal female monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Naloxone was administered 60 or 90 min after nasogastric alcohol administration when blood alcohol levels were above 120 and 140 mg/dl. The rate of naloxone infusion (i.v. bolus or slowly over 10 min) and basal levels of progesterone were critical determinants of the anterior pituitary response to opioid antagonist stimulation. Bolus administration of naloxone did not stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) under control or alcohol conditions. Slow naloxone infusion significantly stimulated LH (P less than .01-.05), but not FSH, in monkeys with high basal progesterone levels (14.1-15.8 ng/ml) under both control and alcohol conditions. Naloxone stimulation of LH was equivalent under control and 2.5 g/kg alcohol conditions (60 and 53% above base line). The LH response to naloxone was enhanced after administration of 3.5 g/kg alcohol and increased to 151% above base line (P less than .01) in monkeys with high progesterone levels. In monkeys with low progesterone levels (3.6-4.6 ng/ml), slow naloxone infusion did not stimulate LH or FSH after sucrose control or 3.5 g/kg alcohol administration, but LH increased (P less than .05) after 2.5 g/kg alcohol administration. A slow infusion of naloxone suppressed PRL levels significantly below base line after sucrose and alcohol administration in monkeys with high (P less than .01-.0002) and low progesterone levels (P less than .0001). Naloxone suppression of PRL was equivalent after alcohol and sucrose control administration. Alcohol alone did not suppress PRL levels significantly. We conclude that acute alcohol administration, with peak blood alcohol levels above 240 and 300 mg/dl, does not attenuate hypothalamic and pituitary responsivity to naloxone stimulation.\r"

Following the establishment of baseline values in each animal, cardiac output, pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (Ppw), arterial pH and gas levels, and ECG changes were recorded at ten-minute intervals. CO2 was delivered into the femoral circulation for 30 minutes. Following the experiment, measurements were repeated during a 20-minute recovery period. Ppa and Ppw increased significantly during the experiment but returned to baseline values after 70 minutes. Cardiac output, which increased significantly, remained high after the same period and was paralleled by cardiac rate. There was no significant change in systemic blood pressure or arterial oxygenation. Only at the highest flow rate were there observable changes in PCO2, accompanied by mild acidosis. One of the six animals displayed premature ventricular contractions at the inception of the highest flow rate. Since the delivery rate of CO2 per kilogram of body weight clearly exceeded that generally used in human hysteroscopic surgery (35-100 mL/min), these experimental results suggest that CO2, when employed as a distension modality in hysteroscopic surgery, displays a wide margin of safety.\r"

The patients' granulocytes demonstrated a decrease (to zero levels) in LT generation postburn. The level of generated LT's resembled that of healthy donors when the patients recovered from their trauma (after day 40 postburn). In contrast, the granulocytes of patients who finally succumbed to their injuries showed poor responsiveness over the total time. An enhanced LTC4 production by granulocytes correlated with an increase in eosinophils within the granulocyte fraction. In addition, the reduced LTB4 production was accompanied by an enhanced LTB4 metabolism to biologically less active products (omega-oxidated metabolites). Thus, the capacity of patients' PMN's to release chemotactic substances was further decreased. The onset of this PMN dysfunction correlated with the onset of invasive microbial growth as determined by the quantitative bacterial analysis of full-thickness biopsy specimens. Our data provide evidence that the altered mediator release of patients' PMN's is closely related to a depressed host defense.\r"

Twenty-five dogs had 4 mm x 7 cm PTFE grafts implanted bilaterally into the femoral arteries. A subcutaneous infusion pump was used to deliver either saline solution (control) or 9-beta-methyl carbacyclin (Ciprostine) at 100 (CARB-100) or 200 ng/kg/min (CARB-200) through a femoral artery branch just proximal to one of the femoral grafts, with the contralateral graft serving as a noninfused control. Graft-platelet deposition (with 111In-labeled platelets) was measured between the fifth and seventh days, with patency determined on the seventh day. Dogs were classified as aggregators (AGG [+]) if the preoperative epinephrine-enhanced sodium arachidonate platelet aggregation was greater than 20%. CARB-200 infusion significantly improved ipsilateral graft patency (80%) compared with noninfused grafts (50%, p less than 0.05), or grafts in control and CARB-100 dogs (43%, p less than 0.05). Anastomotic platelet deposition was decreased bilaterally in CARB-200 dogs by 45% to 59% compared with CARB-100 and control dogs (p less than 0.05). With the exception of grafts infused with CARB-200, AGG (+) dogs had significantly lower graft patency (26%) than nonaggregator AGG (-) dogs (71%, p less than 0.01). CARB-200 infusion significantly improved graft patency in AGG (+) dogs (71%), compared with control and CARB-100-infused grafts (19%, p less than 0.025). Intra-arterial 9-beta-methyl carbacyclin improved early PTFE graft patency and inhibited platelet deposition in a severe canine model, independent of baseline platelet aggregation status, which also had an important effect on graft patency.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening women at moderate (prevalence, 7.9%) risk for urogenital infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. The characteristics of culture and direct antigen tests were based on published values. Those of serology were based on a comparative study in 434 college women. Three serological tests were evaluated: microimmunofluorescence, an indirect fluorescent antibody assay, and an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Their sensitivities and specificities were 97% and 64%, 87% and 64%, and 84% and 51%, respectively, compared with culture. Screening all patients with a direct antigen test costing less than $12 was more cost-effective than neither testing nor treating patients, although only 53% of patients with positive test results would actually be infected. The use of culture alone or as a confirmatory test was less cost-effective but had high positive predictive values. Seropositivity was not highly predictive of active infection. Chlamydial screening can be cost-effective in moderate-risk women.\r"

  ".W": "Our purpose was to determine if the introduction of prospective payment according to diagnosis related groups (DRGs) was associated with any adverse effect on the nutritional status of patients undergoing massive resections for head and neck cancer. The hypothesis was that malnourished patients, in particular those admitted since prospective payment was instituted, would be less well nourished at the time of surgery due to shortened preoperative stays, and, therefore, they would have more postoperative complications than malnourished patients admitted before DRGs. We compared 59 male patients with cancer of the head and neck admitted for massive resections before the introduction of DRGs with 61 similar patients admitted after the introduction of DRGs. These patients were classified as being either malnourished or well nourished. Nutritional status did not differ significantly at admission but was worse at surgery after the introduction of DRGs. In malnourished patients, complication scores were over two times higher after the introduction of DRGs. We conclude that malnourished patients have not fared as well since the prospective payment system was introduced and that other ways need to be devised so malnourished patients can be treated, such as adjusting DRG payments or providing preadmission nutritional support.\r"

To examine the toxicity of monoclonal LC's in man, 11 kidney specimens (EXP group) obtained from patients with monotypical LC-related renal disease (7 lambda, 4 kappa), documented by the presence of monoclonal LC's in the serum or urine and in the tissue, were examined by light, immunofluorescence, electron, and immunoelectron microscopy. This EXP group had monotypical LC deposition in the tubules and/or the glomeruli and did not have evidence of intraluminal LC precipitation and cast formation, which alters tubule morphology. A control group (CON; N = 12) of kidney specimens was obtained from patients who had proteinuria greater than 2.5 g/24 hr and mean age (49 +/- 4 vs. 59 +/- 3 years; P = NS), serum creatinine concentration (2.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.5 mg/dl; P = NS) and creatinine clearance (65 +/- 13 vs. 63 +/- 12 ml/min; P = NS) similar to the EXP group. All of the EXP specimens demonstrated varying degrees of proximal tubule damage, manifested by cell vacuolation, desquamation, loss of the luminal brush border, and, often, coagulation necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin has been compared to standard unfractionated (UF) heparin in hemodialysis/hemofiltration in a 12 month, randomized study. Seventy patients with end-stage chronic renal failure starting dialysis treatment were randomly assigned to one of two groups treated with either LMW or UF heparin. The LMW and UF heparin doses used produced similar plasma anti-FXa levels, and comparable antithrombotic effectiveness was observed in the two groups as reflected in similar incidences of thrombus formation in the extracorporeal circulation: 1.59% and 1.33% for LMW and UF heparin, respectively. No bleeding complications were seen with either heparin, but significantly (P less than 0.05) fewer erythrocyte concentrates were needed in the LMW heparin patients. Mean factor VIII activities had risen significantly (P less than 0.001) after 12 months in the UF heparin group, whereas they were unchanged in the LMW heparin group. A significant (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma triglycerides was observed in the UF heparin group which was attributable to six (18.8%) of the patients in this group. Triglyceride concentrations remained relatively constant in the LMW heparin group. Post-heparin lipolytic activity, and in particular hepatic lipase activity, was not stimulated to the same extent in the LMW heparin-treated patients as compared to the UF heparin group. We conclude that LMW heparin is a suitable alternative to standard UF heparin for anticoagulation in hemodialysis/hemofiltration therapy. It may offer potential advantages with regard to a lower requirement for erythrocyte concentrates and less derangement of certain metabolic parameters, such as factor VIII, triglycerides and plasma lipase activity.\r"

Three potential preservation solutions were studied: the St. Thomas' Hospital no. 1 cardioplegic solution, Bretschneider's HTP solution, and a solution originated in our laboratory, CP5, which we have previously studied in the rabbit heart with functional assessment by Langendorff perfusion. After being flushed with one of these solutions, each heart was stored at 0 degrees C for 12 hours, during which time it was subjected to repeated phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance scans. It was shown that adenosine triphosphate levels decayed more slowly with CP5 than with either of the other solutions or in the control experiments. Adenosine triphosphate decay was also slower with Bretschneider's HTP than with St. Thomas' Hospital solution, but pH was somewhat better maintained with Bretschneider's HTP than with either other solution or in the control hearts, although the pH did not decrease drastically in any group. CP5 was designed to prevent cell swelling and to reduce the uptake of calcium during storage, for which reasons it contains 30 mmol/L glucose and 0.1 mmol/L calcium. The potassium content is somewhat higher and the sodium and magnesium content somewhat lower than in St. Thomas' Hospital solution, with the objective of stabilizing intracellular concentrations of these ions during storage.\r"

Patients on the active drug reported headaches more frequently than patients on placebo, and a higher proportion of them withdrew from the trial because of headache. Quality-of-life measurements showed a significant adverse effect of active treatment, principally in the social interaction dimension of the sickness impact profile.

  ".W": "During a 2-year period at Indiana University Medical Center, nine patients underwent 51 endoscopic procedures employing the technique of apneic anesthesia for removal of papillomata involving the larynx. The apneic anesthesia technique affords improved visualization of the larynx and subglottis because the view is unencumbered by an endotracheal tube. This unencumbered view allows a more thorough removal of diseased tissue, especially in the posterior commissure and subglottis. In addition, the absence of an endotracheal tube reduces the risk of a fire occurring in the upper airway and eliminates the chance of physically disseminating papilloma particles into the lower tracheal-bronchial tree or toward the physician--a problem that is inherent in the intermittent jet ventilation technique. No significant complications related to the use of this technique have been encountered; however, the safety of apneic anesthesia is greatly enhanced by using a pulse oximeter and transcutaneous oxygen monitor to continuously monitor arterial oxygen saturation. Details of the apneic anesthesia technique are described, as are the relevant aspects of pulmonary physiology, which must be clearly understood to safely employ this method.\r"

We examined the efficacy of interferon gamma, a physiologic activator of phagocytic-cell function, in the treatment of the disease. Two subcutaneous injections of recombinant interferon gamma (0.1 mg per square meter of body-surface area per dose) were administered on consecutive days to four patients with the X-linked form of the disease. Treatment resulted in 5- to 10-fold increases in superoxide production by granulocytes and monocytes; the improvement was sustained for more than two weeks. Granulocyte bactericidal activity rose proportionally. In the two most responsive patients, both phagocytic functions reached the normal range of activity. In association with these functional changes, we observed an increase in cellular contents of phagocyte cytochrome b (a critical component of the superoxide-producing oxidase) and immunoreactive cytochrome b heavy chain (the product of the gene that is defective in X-linked chronic granulomatous disease). Levels of cytochrome b detected by spectrophotometry rose from near zero to 10 to 50 percent of normal values. This study demonstrates partial correction of the cellular defects in chronic granulomatous disease by interferon gamma and provides a basis for clinical trials of the agent.\r"

On the basis of data pooled from the literature, this form of therapy resulted in a 25 percent relative reduction annually in the mortality rate for years 1 to 3 and a 7 percent relative reduction for years 4 to 6 after a myocardial infarction. The estimated cost of six years of routine beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy to save an additional year of life was $23,400 in low-risk patients, $5,900 in medium-risk patients, and $3,600 in high-risk patients, assuming that the entire benefit of earlier treatment is lost immediately after six years. Under a more likely assumption--that the benefit of six years of treatment wears off gradually over the subsequent nine years--the estimated cost of therapy per year of life saved would be $13,000 in low-risk patients, $3,600 in medium-risk patients, and $2,400 in high-risk patients. As compared with coronary-artery bypass grafting and the medical treatment of hypertension, routine beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy has a relatively favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.\r"

Robinson argued that the two species differed in the proportions of meat and vegetables consumed. More recently it has been suggested that Paranthropus, with its presumably larger body size, simply processed greater amounts of the same foods eaten by Australopithecus to maintain 'functional equivalence'. Microscopic dental wear patterns are related to the dietary habits of extant mammals, and quantification of these patterns is useful in distinguishing among primates with different diets. Nevertheless, few attempts have been made to use microwear in the reconstruction of early hominid diets, and only very recently has the quantification of such data been initiated. While microwear fabrics can be reduced to individual elements (for example, scratches and pits), there is some disagreement over exactly how they should be defined and measured. Fourier transforms have been applied successfully in the study of a variety of physical and biological patterns, and recently they have been used to characterize and distinguish different tooth wear patterns more objectively. Here we report the first combined use of image processing and other quantitative techniques to analyse the dental microwear of early hominids. Our results suggest that Paranthropus ate substantially more hard food items than Australopithecus.\r"

  ".U": "88261502\r", 
  ".W": "Like other viruses that infect primate cells, the human T lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) stimulates production of some host cell proteins. In particular, HTLV-I infected T cells synthesize interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) chain, which is probably induced through the mediation of the tat-I gene product of the virus. Activated T cells contain a trascription factor called NF-kappa B, which stimulates the expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by binding to an 11-base-pair enhancer sequence called kappa B. We have now found evidence that a similar transcription factor is involved in the induction of IL-2R alpha expression by tat-I. We have identified a sequence upstream of IL-2R alpha which is the same as the kappa B site at 9 of 11 base pairs, competes for binding to the kappa B sequence, and serves as a tat-I responsive element when multiple copies are inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter. The tat-I product also induces kappa B and the IL-2R alpha kappa B binding activity in transfected Jurkat T lymphoid leukaemia cells. Both HTLV-I and HIV-1 thus interact with NF-kappa B-like transcription factors which might normally regulate expression of a growth factor receptor gene.\r"

  ".U": "88261524\r", 
  ".W": "One of the biochemical results of ethanol exposure is a change in the amount of the intracellular second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) produced in response to receptor stimulation. In general, acute ethanol exposure increases the amount of cAMP produced on stimulation of receptors coupled to the enzyme adenylyl cyclase via the GTP-binding protein Gs, whereas chronic ethanol exposure has the opposite effect (results for receptors coupled via Gi have been more variable). We previously reported that adaptation to continuous ethanol exposure reduces receptor-stimulated cAMP production by 25-35% in a neuroblastoma cell line (NG108-15), and an even greater reduction of 75% was observed in lymphocytes taken from actively-drinking alcoholics. This reduction in receptor-stimulated cAMP levels was recently confirmed in platelets from alcoholics. None of these studies, however, determined whether more than one receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activity was affected in the same cell. Here we report that chronic ethanol exposure causes desensitization of heterologous receptors coupled to Gs as cAMP production mediated by prostaglandin E1 as well as by adenosine is reduced by approximately 30% in NG108-15 cells. We show that, after chronic ethanol exposure, the activity of the alpha subunit of Gs is decreased by 29%, the amount of alpha s protein is decreased by 38.5%, and alpha s messenger RNA is decreased by 30%. Thus, cellular adaptation to ethanol involves a reduction in alpha s mRNA and, as a consequence, reduced cAMP production by heterologous receptors coupled to Gs. Such changes in cAMP production may account for the tolerance and physical dependence on ethanol in alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "The vast majority of mature T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs use the CD3-associated alpha, beta T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimer for antigen recognition. A second class of TCRs consists of disulphide-linked gamma and delta proteins that are also CD3-associated. A subset of early CD3+ fetal and adult CD4- 8- thymocytes express gamma, delta TCRs before alpha, beta TCRs are detectable. In addition, a minor (1-5%) subpopulation of peripheral T lymphocytes, and some spleen cells from nude mice express gamma, delta TCRs. Notably, dendritic epidermal cells have also been shown to express gamma, delta TCRs. All of these populations lack CD4 and CD8 molecules. We now report that most mature T cells residing in the murine intestinal epithelium express CD3-associated TCRs composed of gamma-chains disulphide-linked to a protein resembling the delta-chain. The striking feature of these intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) was that they were exclusively CD4-8+. In addition, approximately half of CD3-bearing IEL lacked detectable Thy-1 on the cell surface, which is unprecedented for murine T cells. In contrast to other CD8+ peripheral T cells, freshly isolated IEL could be induced to display cytolytic activity by engaging the CD3 molecule, indicating that activation had occurred in vivo. Thus, CD8+ IEL are a phenotypically diverse and anatomically restricted population of lymphocytes that use gamma-chain containing heterodimers for antigen recognition.\r"

In D. melanogaster, all homoeo-box genes characterized to date are involved in major aspects of embryogenesis. We report here the molecular characterization of a Drosophila homoeo-box gene that has no apparent involvement in early embryogenesis. The gene appears to be rough, a gene implicated in pattern formation in the developing eye. It is expressed in cells within, and posterior to, the morphogenetic furrow, the site of the primary pattern forming events in the developing retina, and also in a region of the brain of the third instar larva. We have found no genetic or molecular evidence of a role for this gene in other aspects of fly development.\r"

Before drug administration, MSA was only rarely observed with the patient in the supine position. There was a slight increase in MSA during head-up tilting to 40 degrees, and orthostatic hypotension (OH) occurred just after the body was tilted head upward to 40 degrees. MSA became prominent 30 minutes after the oral administration of 200 mg of L-threo-DOPS while the patient was in a 40 degree head-up position, and the OH was improved. The MSA discharge rate decreased and OH reappeared 3 hours after oral administration, when the plasma concentration of norepinephrine was at its highest level. We suggest that the OH improved mainly because of the increase in MSA due to L-threo-DOPS, and that the drug may activate sympathetic outflow at a site proximal to the sympathetic ganglion.\r"

  ".W": "The rationale for the use of interferon (IFN) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on its recognized antiviral and immunomodulating actions. The pathogenesis of MS is generally believed to be due to an immunologic response in a genetically predisposed individual, localized within the CNS white matter, and triggered by exposure to an environmental agent such as a virus. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of systemic natural alpha IFN in 24 patients with exacerbating-remitting MS, patients with a strictly exacerbating-remitting course showed a reduction in the frequency and severity of exacerbations, while those with exacerbations superimposed upon a chronic progressive course did not benefit from this treatment, primarily because of side effects that included fever, malaise, and fatigue. Since the performance of this study, it has been shown that the preparation of natural human alpha interferon used in this trial may lead to side effects in some individuals through the production of immune complexes (ICs). These ICs were due to the generation of antibodies reacting with residual Sendai virus proteins used in the preparation of the IFN, and retained in the final formulation. The encouraging results of this and other preliminary studies of alpha or beta IFN but not gamma IFN therapy in MS, coupled with the current availability of more highly purified interferon preparations, warrants further clinical trials of IFN in MS, focusing on beta interferon preparations in particular.\r"

  ".W": "The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein that serves as the cofactor in the cholera toxin-catalyzed activation of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein of adenylate cyclase (Gs). An oligonucleotide probe based on the partial amino acid sequence was used to clone ARF from a bovine adrenal chromaffin cDNA library. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ARF gene was then cloned from a YCp50 genomic library by cross-species hybridization by using the coding region of the bovine gene. RNA gel blots of poly(A)+ RNA indicate that only one ARF message size (900 and 2000 base pairs) is present in yeast and cows, respectively. Comparison of the cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of ARF to other GTP-binding proteins reveals a structural relationship between ARF and the ras family of proteins. A slightly better structural relationship is detected when ARF is compared to the alpha subunits of the trimeric GTP-binding proteins, including Gs alpha. All of the biochemical characteristics of the purified ARF, including the lack of GTPase activity and the posttranslational myristoylation, are consistent with the derived sequences. Comparison of the ARF sequences to that of the chicken processed pseudogene (CPS-1), previously reported as a ras homologue, reveals that CPS-1 is actually an ARF-derived gene. These results demonstrate that ARF is a GTP-binding protein with structural features of both the ras and the trimeric GTP-binding protein families.\r"

  ".W": "The tertiary structure of most icosahedral viral capsid proteins consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a hydrophobic interior. In a group of picornaviruses, this hydrophobic pocket can be filled by suitable organic molecules, which thereby stop viral uncoating after attachment and penetration into the host cell. The antiviral activity of these agents is probably due to increased rigidity of the capsid protein, which inhibits disassembly. The hydrophobic pocket may be an essential functional component of the protein and, therefore, may have been conserved in the evolution of many viruses from a common precursor. Since eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrels, with a topology as in viral capsid proteins, are not generally found for other proteins involved in cell metabolism, this class of antiviral agents is likely to be more virus-specific and less cytotoxic. Furthermore, the greatest conservation of viral capsid proteins occurs within this pocket, whereas the least conserved part is the antigenic exterior. Thus, compounds that bind to such a pocket are likely to be effective against a broader group of serologically distinct viruses. Discovery of antiviral agents of this type will, therefore, depend on designing compounds that can enter and fit snugly into the hydrophobic pocket of a particular viral capsid protein. The major capsid protein, p24, of human immunodeficiency virus would be a likely suitable target.\r"

Using a sensitive RNase-mapping procedure, we detect induced HLA-DR alpha mRNA as early as 8 hr after IFN-gamma treatment; maximal accumulation occurs by 48 hr. Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, abolishes the IFN-gamma-induced accumulation of HLA-DR alpha mRNA, indicating that de novo synthesis of a trans-acting protein factor is required for induction of this major histocompatibility complex class II gene. Nuclear run-off transcription assays revealed that IFN-gamma acts by directly stimulating the transcription rate of HLA-DR alpha. Similarly, IFN-gamma increased the transcription rate of the class I HLA-A2-encoding gene as well as that of the human invariant chain gene. IFN-gamma-induced transcription of HLA-DR alpha and of the invariant chain gene was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, but IFN-gamma-induced transcription of HLA-A2 was unaffected. Our findings show that transcriptional induction of HLA-DR alpha and the invariant chain gene by IFN-gamma requires the action of an unidentified trans-acting protein.\r"

Distributions of 14C were determined in the carbons of the excreted glucuronides and in the glucose from blood samples drawn from hepatic veins before and after glucagon administration. Eighty percent or more of the 14C from [1-14C]ribose incorporated into the glucuronic acid moiety of the glucuronides was in carbons 1 and 3, with less than 8% in carbon 2. In glucuronic acid from glucuronide excreted when [2-14C]glucose was given, 3.5-8.1% of the 14C was in carbon 1, 2.5-4.3% in carbon 3, and more than 70% in carbon 2. These distributions are in accord with the glucuronides sampling the glucose unit of the glucose 6-phosphate pool that is a component of the pentose pathway and is intermediate in glycogen formation. It is concluded that the glucuronic acid conjugates of the drugs can serve as a noninvasive means of sampling hepatic glucose 6-phosphate. In human liver, as in animal liver, the classical pentose pathway functions, not the L-type pathway, and only a small percentage of the glucose is metabolized via the pathway.\r"

We now have isolated cDNAs corresponding to a related gene, Krox-24. Krox-24 encodes a protein with zinc fingers nearly identical to those encoded by Krox-20 and similar to those of transcription factor Sp1. Similarity between Krox-20 and Krox-24 proteins also extends to several blocks of amino acid sequence located upstream of the finger region. Like Krox-20, Krox-24 is transiently activated in quiescent cells after treatment with fetal bovine serum or purified growth factors. The kinetics of activation are similar to those of the protooncogene c-fos. The induction does not require de novo protein synthesis, and cycloheximide treatment of the cells leads to superinduction due, at least in part, to mRNA stabilization. In the mouse, the two genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with slightly different patterns. These properties suggest that Krox-20 and Krox-24 may encode transcription factors with identical DNA target sequences and that these factors may be involved in the modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.\r"

It had about 30% of the wild-type level of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) holoenzyme and carboxylase activity when grown at 25 degrees C, but less than 15% when grown at 35 degrees C. Pulse-labeling with 35S showed that the decrease in enzyme level at the restrictive temperature was not a result of reduced synthesis of enzyme subunits. The CO2/O2 specificity factor (VCKO/VOKC, where VC and VO are Vmax values for carboxylation and oxygenation and KC and KO are Km values for CO2 and O2) of the mutant enzyme was found to be significantly less than that of the wild-type enzyme (54 +/- 2 and 62 +/- 1, respectively), and this alteration was accompanied by increases in KO and KC and a decrease in VC/VO. DNA sequencing revealed a single missense mutation in the 68-4PP chloroplast large-subunit gene. This mutation causes leucine to be replaced by phenylalanine at position 290 in the large-subunit polypeptide sequence. These results (i) support previous studies that implicated this region of the large subunit as an important structural component of the enzyme's function and (ii) demonstrate that chloroplast genetic modification of the CO2/O2 specificity factor of a plant-type carboxylase/oxygenase is feasible.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine lymphocytes infected with the parasite Theileria parva continuously secrete a growth factor that is essential for their proliferation in vitro and also constitutively express interleukin 2 receptors on their surface. Dilution of the secreted growth factor, caused by culturing cells at low density, results in retardation of culture growth. Human recombinant interleukin 2, however, effectively substitutes for the diluted growth factor by restoring normal growth rates and also allows Theileria-infected cells to be grown at low density without the use of feeder layers. Secretion of the growth factor and expression of the interleukin 2 receptor depend on the presence of the parasite in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Elimination of the parasite from the cell cytoplasm by the specific antitheilerial drug BW 720c results in the arrest of growth factor secretion and the disappearance of interleukin 2 receptors from the cell surface. This is accompanied by growth arrest and reversion of the infected cells to the morphology of resting lymphocytes. We propose that the continuous proliferation of infected cells in vitro is mediated by autocrine receptor activation.\r"

  ".W": "A phylogenetic tree for the evolution of five representative species from four genera of kinetoplastid protozoa was constructed from comparison of the mitochondrial 9S and 12S rRNA gene sequences and application of both parsimony and evolutionary parsimony algorithms. In the rooted version of the tree, the monogenetic species Crithidia fasciculata is the most deeply rooted, followed by another monogenetic species, Leptomonas sp. The three digenetic species Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania tarentolae branch from the Leptomonas line. The substitution rates for the T. brucei and T. cruzi sequences were 3-4 times greater than that of the L. tarentolae sequences. This phylogenetic tree is consistent with our cladistic analysis of the biological evidence including life cycles for these five species. A tentative time scale can be assigned to the nodes of this tree by assuming that the common ancestor of the digenetic parasites predated the separation of South America and Africa and postdated the first fossil appearance of its host (inferred by parsimony analysis). This time scale predicts that the deepest node occurred at 264 +/- 51 million years ago, at a time commensurate with the fossil origins of the Hemiptera insect host. This implies that the ancestral kinetoplastid and its insect host appeared at approximately the same time. The molecular data suggest that these eukaryotic parasites have an evolutionary history that extends back to the origin of their insect host.\r"

The induction of beta-galactosidase in these fusion strains with the superoxide radical generating agents required aerobic metabolism. Hyperoxygenation (i.e., bubbling of cultures with oxygen gas) also induced the fusions. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide did not induce the fusions at concentrations that are known to invoke an adaptive response. Introduction of oxyR, htpR, or recA mutations did not affect the induction. Two of the fusion strains exhibited increased sensitivity to paraquat but not to hydrogen peroxide. The third fusion strain showed no increased sensitivity to either agent. All three fusions were located in the 45- to 61-min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome.\r"

When analyzed in radioligand binding experiments, intact placental membranes and detergent-solubilized membrane proteins expressed 1.3 and 5.9 X 10(12) receptors per mg of protein, respectively, values that were 13-163 times greater than that observed for U937 membranes. Two protocols were followed to purify the IFN-gamma receptor from octyl glucoside-solubilized membranes: (i) sequential affinity chromatography over wheat germ agglutinin- and IFN-gamma-Sepharose and (ii) affinity chromatography over columns containing receptor-specific monoclonal antibody and wheat germ agglutinin. Both procedures resulted in fully active preparations that were 70-90% pure. Purified receptor migrated as a single molecular species of 90 kDa either when analyzed on silver-stained NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels or when subjected to electrophoretic transfer blot analysis using a labeled IFN-gamma receptor-specific monoclonal antibody. The identity of the 90-kDa component as the receptor was confirmed by demonstrating its ability to specifically bind 125I-labeled IFN-gamma following NaDodSO4/PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Certain receptor preparations converted into a 55-kDa fragment either during purification or upon storage at 4 degrees C. On the basis of N-Glycanase digestion studies, the IFN-gamma receptor appeared to contain 17 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate. The ligand binding site, the epitope for the receptor-specific monoclonal antibody, and all of the N-linked carbohydrate could be localized to the 55-kDa domain of the molecule.\r"

Chromosomal translocations such as the t(14;18)(q32;q21) found in follicular and some nonfollicular lymphomas provide a tumor-specific molecular marker. The 14;18 breakpoints are focused at one of six immunoglobulin heavy chain joining (JH) regions on chromosome 14 and a small major breakpoint region (MBR) of the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18. We utilized universal oligonucleotide primers of a region 5' to the BCL2 MBR and at the 3' end of JH segments to initiate a DNA polymerase chain reaction that amplified these BCL2-JH junctures. Use of thermostable DNA polymerase enabled annealing and synthesis steps at temperatures approaching the melting point of the primers, providing a sensitive and specific assay capable of detecting 1 lymphoma cell in 10(6) normal cells. This technique identified the subclinical presence of leukemic cells in all seven patients examined, including two in clinical remission. It also assessed the effectiveness of protocols designed to purge malignant cells from marrow. Moreover, this approach enabled the rapid DNA sequencing of chromosomal breakpoints without their molecular cloning. This assay markedly refines the capacity to detect minimal residual disease and should improve the ability to determine the stage of disease, stratify treatment, and evaluate therapy.\r"

Cells from 15 of 16 patients with cytochrome b-positive CGD (15 with autosomal and 1 with X chromosome-linked inheritance) and cells from 4 of 14 patients with cytochrome b-negative CGD (13 with X chromosome-linked and 1 with autosomal recessive inheritance) responded. Subcutaneous rHuIFN-gamma (0.01-0.05 mg/m2) administered as a single dose, daily or every other day, for five or six doses to 3 patients whose phagocytes responded to rHuIFN-gamma in vitro resulted in significant improvement in phagocyte bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and increases in superoxide production. Studies on 1 patient's cells indicated the increases in superoxide production correlated with increased membrane cytochrome b. The effects of rHuIFN-gamma persisted for more than a week following cessation of therapy. Thus, we have demonstrated a partial correction in vivo of these CGD patients' phagocyte defect with rHuIFN-gamma. Moreover, the data suggest that a significant proportion of patients with CGD will respond to rHuIFN-gamma with augmentation of phagocyte microbicidal function.\r"

  ".W": "The paired helical filament, the principal constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer disease, is shown to consist of two structurally distinct parts. An external fuzzy region can be removed by Pronase treatment to leave a Pronase-resistant morphologically recognizable core. Scanning transmission electron microscopy gives an estimate for the mass per unit length as 79 kDa.nm-1 before Pronase treatment and 65 kDa.nm-1 after treatment. The fuzzy region carries all the epitopes recognized by two different antisera against microtubule-associated protein tau. By contrast, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) we have raised to paired helical filament cores (mAb 423) decorates Pronase-treated filaments much more strongly than it does untreated ones. We have shown in previous papers that the epitope recognized by mAb 423 is carried by a central 9.5-kDa fragment of tau protein, which therefore forms part of the Pronase-resistant core structure. The remainder of the tau protein incorporated into the filaments must contribute part, if not all, of the fuzzy region. The mass per unit length measurements imply that the three-domain structural subunit of the core that we visualized previously by image reconstruction has a molecular mass of approximately equal to 100 kDa.\r"

The latter two glycolipids bound gonococci with the highest affinity. Lactosylceramide and gangliotriaosylceramide were found in glycolipid preparations from ME180 cells, an epithelial cell line derived from a human cervical carcinoma, and thus are possible receptors for gonococci.

Antiserum 9120, at a final dilution of 1:400, can detect alpha o in as little as 0.2 microgram of Go on immunoblots, and, at a final dilution of 1:20,000, can detect alpha o in 1 microgram of Go on immunoblots. Antiserum and affinity-purified antibody are specific to alpha o. No cross-reactivity was detected to the alpha subunits of the stimulatory or inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins or of transducin (alpha s, alpha i, or alpha T) or to the beta or gamma subunits. Immunoblots revealed a high density of alpha o in rat brain and lung membrane preparations, but other tissues (such as adipose tissue, heart, erythrocytes, and liver) have no detectable alpha o. Developmental studies showed that alpha o in rat brain was low before birth, increased after birth, and reached the full adult level at 4 weeks of age. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of 40-kDa proteins increased for up to 1 week and then decreased. Immunocytochemistry revealed that alpha o was localized to somatic and synaptic membranes in rat brain, whereas little or no alpha o was detected in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies. Our observations suggest that Go in brain might have a role in membrane signal transduction at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites.\r"

A specially constructed tank was used to take pretreatment and posttreatment volumetric measurements of subjects' sprained ankles. Descriptive statistics, a 3 x 3 two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test revealed that cold therapy produced the least edema in subjects with sprained ankles (p less than .05). All three treatments (cold, heat, and contrast bath) produced an increase in the amount of edema in the postacute sprained ankles of the subjects. Heat and contrast bath therapy produced almost identical increases in the amount of ankle edema on each of the three days of the study. We concluded that cold therapy is the most appropriate of the three treatments if the therapeutic objective is to minimize edema before rehabilitative exercise during the third, fourth, and fifth days postinjury for first- and second-degree ankle sprains.\r"

In plants, RuBisCO is built from eight large (L) and eight small (S) polypeptide chains, or subunits. Both S chains and the NH2-terminal domain (N) of L are antiparallel beta, \"open-face-sandwich\" domains with four-stranded beta sheets and flanking alpha helices. The main domain (B) of L is an alpha/beta barrel containing most of the catalytic residues. The active site is in a pocket at the opening of the barrel that is partly covered by the N domain of a neighboring L chain.

However, only one region, which includes the sequence motif GGGGAATCTCCC, was required for activation by both the tax gene product and mitogenic stimulation. Remarkably, this sequence also bound the nuclear factor NF kappa B, which is important for induction of kappa-immunoglobulin gene expression. A model is presented whereby regulation of cellular gene expression by the HTLV-I tax gene product occurs via an indirect mechanism that may involve a post-translational modification of preexistent cellular transcription factors.\r"

By means of RNA blot analyses of cardiac, aortic, and skeletal muscle RNAs in two rat hypertensive models, Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit messenger RNA isoforms (alpha 2 and alpha 3) were shown to be deinduced in response to increased intravascular pressure. The changes were observed after 48 hours or more of experimental hypertension. Under these conditions, there is coordinate induction of another alpha isoform (alpha 1) and of beta-subunit messenger RNAs, probably in response to alterations in sodium flux rather than to elevated blood pressure.\r"

Because these chemicals persist in human tissue, children born to female patients after the outbreak were exposed in utero. In 1985, 117 children born to affected women and 108 unexposed controls were examined and evaluated. The exposed children were shorter and lighter than controls; they had abnormalities of gingiva, skin, nails, teeth, and lungs more frequently than did controls. The exposed children showed delay of developmental milestones, deficits on formal developmental testing, and abnormalities on behavioral assessment. These findings are most consistent with a generalized disorder of ectodermal tissue. This syndrome is one of very few documented to result from transplacental exposure to pollutant chemicals.\r"

This \"run down\" of the GABA-activated conductance can be prevented by the inclusion of magnesium adenosine triphosphate and calcium buffer in the intracellular medium. The amount of chloride conductance that can be activated by GABA is determined by competition between a calcium-dependent process that reduces the conductance and a phosphorylation process that maintains the conductance.\r"

Cost effectiveness was measured through broad diagnostic categories: lumbar pain with or without radiculopathy, cervical pain with and without radiculopathy, and a combination of lumbar and cervical pain. Cost for surgical treatment was determined using community-based charges. This cost was compared to actual cost incurred by outpatient pain treatment together with 6 months aftercare. Significant savings is indicated by the above cost comparison.\r"

This cytotoxicity assay was used to measure residual (unbound) GA in commercial vascular prostheses of biologic origin following manufacturer-recommended rinsing procedures, from which as much as 13.8 ppm GA per gram of tissue per 24 hours continued to be released after 1 month. A brief (1 hour) exposure of cultured endothelial cells to 2 ppm GA delayed growth, while continuous exposure to 4 ppm totally prevented growth for at least 12 days. Endothelial cells exposed to GA demonstrated a reduced efficiency of attachment to standard test surfaces, although prior GA treatment of these surfaces was not detrimental to subsequent cell attachment. GA release from vascular prostheses may contribute to their lack of endothelial cell coverage in human implants and may be indicative of collagen cross-link instability. If so, in vitro cytotoxicity may be helpful in identifying the potential for aneurysm formation in preserved biologic grafts.\r"

A focal area of hypoperfusion (area of diaschisis) was detected in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex in each patient. Hyperventilation caused a significant reduction of regional cerebral blood flow in the area without diaschisis and only a tendency for regional cerebral blood flow to decrease in the area with diaschisis; CO2 inhalation induced a slight increase in regional cerebral blood flow in the area without diaschisis and a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow in the area with diaschisis. Regional cerebral blood flow reactivity to hypocapnia was significantly less in the area with diaschisis than in the area without, whereas the hypercapnic response was more marked in the area with diaschisis than in the area without. Our results suggest that in the area with diaschisis, the arterioles may be abnormally vasoconstricted at rest such that they cannot constrict further in response to hypocapnia but can dilate more during hypercapnia than in the area without diaschisis. This excessive resting vasoconstriction may result from decreased tissue elaboration of CO2 due to local decrease of metabolic function.\r"

A patient with macroglobulinemia experienced chills, fever, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria following the transfusion of 1 unit of red cells (RBCs) shown to be compatible by the low-ionic-strength antiglobulin (LIS-AG) method. Serologic investigation was negative. Intravascular hemolysis occurred with a second \"compatible\" unit. Serologic studies were again negative by LIS-AG and ficin-AG methods, but revealed anti-Jka by MPT. Both donors were Jk(a+b-), and 51Cr studies of the second donor's RBCs revealed a t1/2 of less than 30 minutes, with marked intravascular hemolysis. A LIS-AG-compatible Jk(a-) unit was transfused uneventfully, but with no rise in hematocrit. MPT next revealed anti-C; subsequent 51Cr studies with the Jk(a-), Cc donor's RBCs showed a 51Cr t1/2 of 100 minutes with slight intravascular lysis. Four transfusions of Jk(a-), C- blood were uneventful, but 5 days later the patient's hemoglobin declined. The following day, anti-E was demonstrable exclusively by MPT. 51Cr-labeled Jk(a-), C-, E- RBCs had normal 24-hour survival. The patient's hemoglobin rose to 11 g per dl following transfusions of Jk(a-), C-, E- RBCs, and he was discharged. In vitro studies employing the patient's purified IgM paraprotein revealed no interference with alloantibody binding or detection.\r"

The donor has remained in good health, and no significant abnormalities have been noted in hematologic, biochemical, immunologic, coagulation, and serum protein testing. Extensive experience with this donor suggests that repeated plasma-exchange donation is safe and can sometimes allow single-donor support of severe hemophiliacs.\r"

Forty-nine D-negative oncology patients who received D-positive RBCs via platelet and white cell transfusions were studied to determine if nonresponders to D were likely to form lymphocytotoxic antibody (LCA). Nine patients developed anti-D in 16 to 390 days (mean = 112) after 2.6 to 481 ml (mean = 106) of D-positive RBCs. Forty patients had no evidence of anti-D after 0.8 to 535 ml (mean = 98) of D-positive RBCs and were followed for 14 to 1275 days (mean = 192). The anti-D group had no prior D-positive RBC transfusions, and two of five women making anti-D had previous pregnancies but no record of anti-D. LCA was found in four of nine (44%) patients with anti-D and in 12 of 40 (30%) patients without anti-D (p less than 0.50). Since both D and antigens HLA are considered highly immunogenic, it is of interest that the ability to form anti-D or LCA does not correlate. In fact, more patients (16/49; 32%) made LCA than anti-D (9/49; 18%). Of the 21 alloimmunized patients, 4 made both antibodies, while 17 had selective alloimmunization. It would thus appear that alloimmunization to D and HLA are not strongly linked and may indeed be unrelated.\r"

The other six samples could have been considered Rh positive; however, such a conclusion is inappropriate, since stronger (greater than or equal to 3+) reactions are expected in IS tests with CM-D and the vast majority of true Rh-positive blood samples. Moreover, three of the six false-positive CM-D reactions associated with negative control tests were from patients previously found to be Rh negative. The other three samples gave 1+ to 2+ reactions with CM-D and did not react with anti-A and/or -B; these erroneous CM-D reactions were recognized by confirmatory tests with high-protein anti-D and Rh control reagents that were performed because previous typing results were not on file. Such confirmation, as well as careful grading and proper interpretation of serologic reactions, serves to prevent erroneous Rh typing without the use of a separate, immunologically inert Rh control reagent.\r"

The mechanism by which mannitol prevents hemolysis is unknown. The authors have examined the possibility that mannitol prevents hemolysis by prevention of osmotic swelling of red cells that might otherwise increase their volume beyond their critical hemolytic volume. Storage in artificial media does, indeed, result in swelling of the red cells, which is prevented by mannitol and is increased by the addition of nystatin, an agent that greatly increases the sodium-potassium permeability of the cells. Swelling and hemolysis are correlated at different concentrations of mannitol, but the correlation breaks down when the case of nystatin-treated cells is considered; even with marked swelling, there is relatively little hemolysis. Moreover, increasing the volume of the stored red cells acutely by osmotic means results in relatively little additional hemolysis. These findings make it appear unlikely that simple osmotic lysis is the cause of hemolysis in stored cells. Some other stabilizing effect of mannitol that may or may not be related to its osmotic effect must play a role.\r"

The method involves placement of single or multiple stents spanning the diverticulum and the collecting system proper following percutaneous dilatation of the narrow isthmus that usually provides the communication with the main collecting system. The procedure offers an economical and tissue-sparing approach, which obviates the need for major abdominal or retroperitoneal operation.\r"

We observed increased plasma ANP concentrations in CHF patients in New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV. The fact that such responses already become evident when a patient is in New York Heart Association class II supports the concept that ANP release may counteract the detrimental effects of stimulation of renin and the sympathetic nervous system even in the early phases of heart failure by promoting diuresis and natriuresis, as well as vasodilatation, thus reducing both pre- and afterload. When CHF is severe, however, the counterbalancing effects of ANP may be offset by vasoconstriction and fluid and sodium retention.\r"

A plateau in oxygen uptake, which occurs despite an increase in work load, and which is termed maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), correlates with the maximal exercise cardiac output and can therefore be used to grade the severity of heart failure. The anaerobic threshold occurs at 60 to 70% of VO2 max and is another indicator of the severity of heart failure and, when attained, indicates that the patient is close to performing a maximal test. We have found VO2 max and anaerobic threshold to be objective measures of efficacy of both investigational and noninvestigational therapy in patients with heart failure. A pulmonary limitation to exercise can be identified by the failure to attain anaerobic threshold or VO2 max, as well as exhaustion of the ventilatory reserve, as estimated by maximal voluntary ventilation. Thus, cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be used to (1) grade the severity of heart failure, (2) objectively follow the response to therapy, and (3) differentiate a cardiac from a pulmonary limitation to exercise.\r"

Depleted patients had low rates of NPC (0.8 +/- 0.1 g.kg-1.d-1) compared with nondepleted patients (p less than 0.05) and during TPN anabolism was achieved (0.5 +/- 0.2 g.kg-1.d-1).

Liver lipid and plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides in tumor-bearing and normal rats infused high-fat TPN were markedly higher than in all other groups, suggesting that this level of lipid infusion exceeds the rate of utilization. Plasma glucose and insulin in tumor-bearing rats infused high-fat TPN were higher than in all other groups, which may indicate insulin resistance.

Dysplasia foci were classified into three grades of severity and their locations mapped by camera lucida drawings of each slide. The degree of abnormal staining with each antibody was recorded on the map, and its correlation with dysplasia grade was evaluated. PSA, PAP, and Leu-7 staining were reduced in dysplasia and often absent in severe dysplasia, indicating that reduced differentiation is an early change in prostatic carcinogenesis. PG II and t-PA stains were sometimes positive in a region where they are usually absent, suggesting that deregulation of differentiation markers may accompany reduction in differentiation in these preneoplastic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Our goal was to review the experience at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, England, with combined heart-lung transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since April 1984, 31 patients have undergone heart-lung transplantation. Donors and recipients are carefully matched with regards to serology, morphology, and cytomegalovirus compatibility. A pulmonary preservation fluid has been developed that allows distant organ procurement with a single pulmonary artery flush technique. RESULTS: Acute cardiac rejection has not occurred in these patients. Twenty-three patients are alive between two months and over three years following transplantation. The actuarial survival rate at one year is 78 percent, and 70 percent at two years. Three patients died as a result of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis; in two patients, obliterative bronchiolitis developed, and both died, one after an opportunistic infection developed. Three patients died from other causes. The use of transbronchial biopsy of the lung has provided accurate, early, and safe diagnosis of pulmonary rejection. CONCLUSION: Developments in organ preservation and patient management, as well as careful selection of recipients and donors, have led to the effective use of resources and thereby to these good results. In particular, the incidence of obliterative bronchiolitis has been low, which is attributed to the early treatment of pulmonary rejection following diagnosis by transbronchial biopsy.\r"

  ".W": "A study of the comparative survival of islet xenografts using a combination of treatment modalities was carried out in the spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor rat. Islets were isolated from hamster donors, and after 4 to 6 days of incubation the cells were injected either into the immunologically privileged abdominal testis or into the nonimmunologically favored renal subcapsular space. Postoperatively the rats were given cyclosporine at two different dose schedules. The results showed that islets injected into the abdominal testis of nonimmunosuppressed rats caused the induction of normoglycemia with a mean duration of 8.3 +/- 1.3 days. A significant prolongation of normoglycemia to a mean of 36.1 +/- 4.5 days occurred in rats that were given abdominal, intratesticular islet xenografts and cyclosporine for 30 days. The longest average survival in excess of a mean of 90.1 +/- 6.5 days was achieved in rats that were given abdominal, intratesticular islet xenografts and cyclosporine continuously, every other day. All of the grafted rats reverted to diabetes upon the cessation of cyclosporine. A similar cyclosporine regimen failed to prolong islet xenograft survival for longer than a mean of 9.0 +/- 2.2 days in rats that were given islet xenografts injected into the renal subcapsular space. Extended survival of abdominal, intratesticular islet xenografts corresponded with trough plasma and testis cyclosporine levels of 457 +/- 46 ng/mL and 643 +/- 45 ng/g, of wet weight, respectively. It is concluded that islet xenografts are protected against immune destruction in the BB/Wor rat with type 1 diabetes only as long as the cells are injected into an immunologically privileged site and the host is continuously immunosuppressed with cyclosporine.\r"

All Louisiana members of the American College of Cardiology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were invited to participate. Participants were supplied with a brief endocarditis report form and asked to complete the form as they saw patients with infective endocarditis. Seventy-five patients with infective endocarditis were reported for a case rate of 1.7 per 100,000 persons per year. This report analyzes the results from this one-year study.\r"

We investigated whether terfenadine has a protective effect on UNDW challenges. Twelve mild-to-moderate asthmatics responded to screening a methacholine and UNDW challenge. For four hours after the ingestion of 0, 120, and 240 mg of terfenadine pulmonary responses were performed, followed by a UNDW challenge. Nine of 12 subjects dropped 20% after 120 mg and after 240 mg. There was a suggestion of a protective effect at 120 mg (P = .054), which was significant at 240 mg (P = .012) when the areas under the dose-response curves were compared. Bronchoconstriction induced by UNDW may in part be caused by histamine release and was attenuated by an oral antihistamine.\r"

Patients who received IVIG manufactured after the screening of donors was initiated may still test positive for anti-HIV Ab due to antibodies to human T-lymphocyte cell lines in which viral antigen was prepared. Such false positives must be excluded when testing IVIG recipients. Despite the presence of antibodies to HIV, IVIG has never been documented to transmit the virus.\r"

Chromatograms on which the whole ganglioside fractions from peripheral nerve and brain had been separated were overlaid with appropriate dilutions of the patients' sera (1:100 or greater), and antibody binding was revealed with a radiolabeled or peroxidase-labeled second antibody. Antibodies to ganglioside antigens were detected in 5 of 26 patients with GBS. IgG antibodies in 1 patient reacted strongly with LM1 (sialosyl paragloboside), the major ganglioside of human peripheral nervous system myelin, and its hexaose analog (sialosyl lactosaminyl paragloboside), a minor ganglioside of human peripheral nervous system myelin. The antibody titer in this patient fell 8-fold over 6 weeks coincident with clinical improvement. IgG from 2 other patients with GBS reacted with GD1b ganglioside, and the antibody titers in these patients also decreased substantially with clinical improvement. IgM antibodies in the sera from 2 other patients reacted with GD1a and GT1b gangliosides, which have a shared terminal carbohydrate sequence. Antibodies to gangliosides were not detected in the sera from 19 patients with other neurological diseases or from 10 normal subjects, and the frequency with which antiganglioside antibodies occurred in the patients with GBS was significantly greater than that in the combined control subjects (p less than 0.01). The results demonstrate relatively high levels of antibodies to gangliosides in some GBS patients.\r"

The permeable blood-brain barrier regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems contained increased quantities of ceramide trihexoside. Some central nervous system nuclei associated with autonomic function were also noted to store lipid. Other areas of increased ceramide trihexoside accumulation included specific cortical and brainstem structures. Possible sources for this selective accumulation of ceramide trihexoside within the central and peripheral nervous system include transport of glycolipid from the systemic vascular network and retrograde transsynaptic glycolipid transport.\r"

There was a significant negative correlation between delta Ht SDS and duration of treatment in boys, but not in girls. There was no correlation between delta Ht SDS and relapse rate or the use of cyclophosphamide. In the boys, Ht SDS decreased significantly only after the age of 10 years and was associated with delay in the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics. Eight adolescent boys were assessed endocrinologically by an overnight hormone profile. Blunting of the pulsatility of growth hormone and gonadotrophins was seen in six. Normal profiles were seen in two subjects who were both off steroid treatment at the time of study. Abnormal endocrine function in adolescent boys treated long term for steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome corresponded with the clinical picture of delayed onset of puberty, which accounted for severe growth retardation in a substantial proportion of subjects.\r"

Twenty five children with asthma entered a 10 week trial of two baseline weeks followed by eight weeks of treatment by the inhalation of 20 mg of sodium cromoglycate spincaps four times a day. Individual clinical response was determined by the differences between baseline and treatment periods of: (a) percentage of symptomless days (delta score 0); (b) diary derived daily score for four symptoms (delta DS); and (c) peak expiratory flow rate (delta PEFR). At the end of the treatment period, patients inhaled a 20 mg spincap of sodium cromoglycate and the technique of inhalation was graded. Concentrations of sodium cromoglycate in serum were measured by radioimmunoassay in samples withdrawn 5 to 120 minutes after inhalation. Delta Score 0, delta DS, and delta PEFR correlated significantly with the area under the concentration time curve. Both the area under the sodium cromoglycate concentration time curve and clinical response correlated significantly with inhalation technique score. We suggest that response of children with asthma to inhalation treatment with sodium cromoglycate is correlated to its serum concentrations.\r"

Eleven children received GHRH 1-40 in four subcutaneous nocturnal pulses (dose 4-8 micrograms/kg/day) and eight (three of whom were also treated with GHRH 1-40) received GHRH 1-29 twice daily (dose 8-16 micrograms/kg/day). Altogether 73% of the children receiving GHRH 1-40 and 63% receiving GHRH 1-29 showed a growth response. Double the daily dose of GHRH 1-29 was required to obtain equivalent growth response to pulsatile GHRH 1-40. A significant linear correlation was shown between growth hormone secretion and height velocity on GHRH 1-40 but not on GHRH 1-29 and there was a significant correlation between plasma GHRH and serum growth hormone concentrations during GHRH 1-40 administration. Response to conventional growth hormone treatment in a matched group of children was significantly better than the response after GHRH. A significant improvement in height velocity was observed in the children transferred to growth hormone replacement. Growth hormone remains the treatment of choice in growth hormone insufficiency. GHRH treatment may be of benefit in children with less severe growth hormone insufficiency in the presence of pulsatile endogenous growth hormone secretion.\r"

Burns and scalds and poisoning caused more severe injuries than other accidents. A strong correlation was found between the parent's social class and the severity of the accident, but there was no correlation with ethnic group as indicated by the parents' country of birth. The development of a reliable scale of severity is important if programmes of prevention of accidents to children in the home are to be evaluated successfully.\r"

In nine of the 15 patients with peritoneal seeding and/or ascites, cancerous ascites was absent after this treatment. In all cases, repeated cytologic examinations of the lavage from Douglas's pouch were negative. The postoperative courses were uneventful except for Patients 1 and 10, in whom slight leakage occurred. All patients were discharged and are in good health at the time of this writing, 7.2 +/- 4.6 months after the treatment. The Case 4 Patient recently died in a traffic accident. In all patients, transient hepatic dysfunction and hypoproteinemia occurred after the operation. This extensive surgery combined with IPHP using MMC and MIS was well tolerated and is a safe antitumor treatment for gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination. Neurotoxicity due to MIS was nil.\r"

To evaluate whether growth hormone (GH) can promote anabolism in surgical patients, 11 stable malnourished individuals were studied. In the initial trial, subjects received a constant parenteral infusion of a hypocaloric diet that provided approximately 1100 kcal/24 hr and 1.3 g protein/kg/24 hr for at least 2 weeks. During 1 week, GH 10 mg was given subcutaneously daily, whereas the other week served as the control. Daily balance studies demonstrated that administration of GH resulted in significant retention of nitrogen (+3.4 g/24 h) and phosphorus (+218 mg/24 h), despite provision of only 60% of caloric requirements. With GH, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and potassium fell, whereas glucose and insulin tended to rise, and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 increased three to fourfold. Weight gain occurred with GH and was associated with positive mineral and water balance. Six patients received GH (10 mg subcutaneously daily) for 13-25 consecutive days after an initial control week. Significant nitrogen and phosphorus retention occurred over the entire period of GH administration, and no significant side effects were observed. In these depleted patients, GH caused significant and sustained nitrogen retention over a wide range of nutritional support. GH appears to enhance the efficacy of parenteral nutrition in stable individuals requiring repletion of body protein.\r"

The quantity and activity of t-PA in the vitreous, serum, and aqueous were determined at ten minutes and at 3, 6, 15, 24, and 48 hours after initial injection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a spectrophotometric solid-phase fibrin assay (SOFIA). In eyes without an intravitreal fibrin clot, the estimated half-life for t-PA was 4.3 hours by SOFIA and 5.8 hours by ELISA. In eyes containing a vitreal fibrin clot, the half-life increased to 9.8 hours by SOFIA and 11.9 hours by ELISA. Both of these half-lives were significantly greater than the half-life for eyes without fibrin. Regardless of the presence of fibrin, intravitreal t-PA activity was significantly less than t-PA quantity, suggesting the presence of a t-PA inhibitor. A peak in aqueous t-PA occurred before six hours, indicating that t-PA was cleared in part through the anterior chamber. There was no measurable serum t-PA at any of the sampling times.\r"

Those BHTs with low suppressive capacity (L-supp) showed an increased venous distensibility in comparison with those with high suppressive capacity (H-supp). Saline infusion led to a significant increase in blood pressure only in L-supp BHTs, which was associated with enhanced 24-hour postloading natriuresis and raised plasma levels of an Na/K ATPase inhibitor (+12.2%). This result underlines the importance of venous distensibility as a determinant of pressor and humoral response to acute volume expansion.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous infusion of gammaglobulin (IVGG) has been extensively used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults to acutely raise the platelet count but not as a maintenance therapy. This report describes the maintenance treatment of adults with chronic ITP using repeated infusions of 800 to 1,000 mg/kg of IVGG. Sixteen of 40 patients were able to discontinue all therapy after receiving between one and 15 infusions. Five patients achieved remission and 11 other patients became stable without therapy (SWT) maintaining a platelet count greater than 20,000/microL without bleeding. The average quantity of gammaglobulin received for all patients was 606 g per patient. Of the 30 patients who underwent but did not respond to splenectomy, 11 (37%) were able to discontinue all therapy by either achieving remission (5) or becoming SWT (6). None of the five patients who achieved remission did so after only the initial therapy; all first received between one and 12 maintenance infusions. The ten splenectomized patients who were unresponsive to IVGG also failed to subsequently respond to conventional therapy including immunosuppressive agents and androgens. No toxicity of IVGG was seen except for postinfusion headaches. IVGG is an effective although expensive maintenance therapy for adults with ITP and is useful in patients who have not responded to splenectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of procoagulant activity (PCA) by human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) was studied in human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 and human peripheral blood monocytes. Using a one-step recalcificating clotting assay, PCA in cell lysates or whole cell preparations was measured by comparison to a rabbit brain thromboplastin standard. There was a dose- and time-dependent increase in PCA when U937 cells were cultured with rTNF. The effect of rTNF was not enhanced by recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma). Cycloheximide inhibited the expression of PCA by U937 cells, showing that protein synthesis was necessary to mediate the effects of rTNF. Whole cell preparations demonstrated that greater than 80% of the PCA was expressed on the surface of the cells. The PCA functioned as a tissue factor-like substance, since it required coagulation factor VII and factor X. rTNF also increased PCA in human monocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect was abrogated by boiling the rTNF for ten minutes, and was not inhibited by adding polymyxin-B to the cultures, making it unlikely that endotoxin accounted for the observed effects. These results suggest that TNF-induced expression of tissue factor by mononuclear phagocytes may modulate immunologic, inflammatory, and hemostatic processes.\r"

Phorbol esters can act as differentiating agents in a number of cell systems including murine megakaryocytes. We report the effects of phorbol esters on the previously described long-term human megakaryocytic leukemia cell culture, EST-IU. While two nontransforming phorbols fail to affect these cells, the transforming phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces a phenotype with characteristics of more mature megakaryocytes in a dose-related manner. This phenotype includes an increased adherence to untreated plastic or glass, polyploidization, an increase in cell size, and increased expression of both platelet glycoproteins and factor VIII-related antigen. Two-color flow cytometric analysis allowed simultaneous determinations of DNA content and the expression of surface membrane antigens or alpha-granule constituents, providing evidence that nuclear, membrane, and cytoplasmic maturation occur in parallel in this cellular system. TPA-induced maturation of EST-IU cells provides an important new cellular model for the further study of human megakaryocyte development.\r"

Induction of proliferation by G-CSF alone was observed in six of 27 cases of AML. All acute promyelocytic leukemias with the specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and one case of myelomonocytic leukemia with balanced chromosomal translocation involving chromosome 17 at band q12q21 were induced to proliferate strongly by the G-CSF. However, contrary to the long-term proliferative effect observed with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF activity can be characterized by its capability to initiate and promote the growth of responding AML cells but not to sustain long-term proliferation. Finally, no terminal differentiation was found, as assessed by morphology, cytochemistry, and cell surface marker analysis. These results indicate that G-CSF may be sufficient to provide a specific signal for induction of a transient proliferation in AML without induction of terminal differentiation. The cells with the highest response are clonal leukemia cells, all bearing a translocation involving the chromosome region 17q12q21 in which the G-CSF gene has been recently located.\r"

In untreated and immunosuppressed patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and in control individuals we measured (a) serum levels of IFN-gamma and TNF and its production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC); (b) serum levels of neopterin, a product that reflects endogenous IFN production; (c) resting and activated lymphocyte subpopulations; and (d) serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). Serum levels of IFN and TNF did not differ significantly in untreated and treated SAA patients and control individuals. Spontaneous and phytohemagglutinin-induced production of IFN and TNF by PBMNC, however, were highly increased in both untreated and treated SAA patients. Increased and decreased neopterin serum levels in untreated and treated SAA patients, respectively, suggest modulation of endogenous lymphokine release subsequent to immunosuppression. HLA-DR+ antigen was mainly expressed by CD8 T cells. Circulating numbers of activated (CD4 and CD8) T cells and serum levels of IL-2R were not increased in both untreated and treated SAA patients. The proportion of HLA-DR+ T cells in the PBMNC of untreated SAA patients correlated with the extent of lectin-induced IFN production. Although we were unable to confirm previous reports in SAA on (a) detectable IFN in blood and bone marrow serum, (b) improvement of stem cell growth upon neutralization of endogenous IFN, (c) absolutely increased numbers of circulating activated T cells, and (d) normalization of these abnormalities subsequent to successful immunosuppression, our data clearly support previous reports on abnormal lymphokine production in severe aplastic anemia. Our failure to relate this phenomenon to the severity of disease states, however, further raises doubts on the pathogenetic significance of lymphokine overproduction in SAA.\r"

Although some cases of elliptocytosis result from defects in spectrin, the specific structural abnormality has yet to be identified in the majority of cases. Protein 4.1 plays an essential role in erythrocyte membrane physiology, and deficiencies have been implicated in only a few rare cases of elliptocytosis. By using 4.1 immunoblots and a 4.1 radioimmunoassay we identified distinct variants of protein 4.1 in 15 elliptocytic members of three US white families with the Rh-linked form of elliptocytosis. Elliptocytic members of family G were heterozygotes for a low-molecular weight (mol wt) 4.1 variant (65,000 to 68,000 daltons; normal, 80,000) inherited in linkage with the Rz phenotype. Elliptocytic members of family C expressed a simple partial deficiency of protein 4.1 (63% of the normal level) that was inherited in linkage with the r phenotype. Elliptocytic members of family N were heterozygotes for a high-mol wt 4.1 variant (100,000 daltons) also inherited in linkage with the r phenotype. These studies indicate that mutant forms of protein 4.1 are not uncommon in elliptocytosis among whites and that different kindreds probably express different mutations. The observed linkage of elliptocytosis and Rh blood type most likely results from the close proximities of the 4.1 gene (site of the mutation) and the Rh gene, which is located nearby on the short arm of chromosome 1.\r"

Functional activity was determined using a standardized model of bleeding and kinetic characteristics charted by performing assays of factor VIII functional and antigenic activities over time. To obtain an adequate comparison with plasma-derived factor VIII, a crossover study in two animals was performed in which each animal received either recombinant factor VIII or a highly purified plasma-derived factor VIII on day 1 and the alternative three days later (day 4). Both factor VIII preparations were functionally effective with complete correction of the cuticle bleeding time occurring one hour after infusion. The observed recovery was full and close to predicted for both preparations. The survival curves obtained for both functional and antigenic activities for both preparations were virtually identical and within the anticipated range determined from previous experiments using infusions of conventional factor VIII preparations. The plasma half-disappearance time (T 1/2) for recombinant factor VIII and plasma-derived factor VIII was 9.2 and 7.9 hours, respectively. Plasma samples obtained following infusion were subjected to chromatography on Sepharose 4B. The elution profile of factor VIII antigen activity was compared with that obtained with the infusates. A clear shift in profile was observed with the plasma samples, suggesting complexing of the infused factor VIII material with circulating canine von Willebrand factor (vWF). The elution profile of vWF antigen was superimposable, thus providing further evidence in support of this assumption. The study provided evidence that recombinant factor VIII possesses full functional activity in vivo, binds to circulating vWF, and exhibits normal recovery and survival characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of purified recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rhuTNF-alpha) was assessed alone and in combination with purified recombinant human interferon gamma (rhuIFN-gamma) for its effects on enhancing release from human monocytes of activities that stimulate colony formation by granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells. RhuTNF-alpha or rhuIFN-gamma enhanced release of colony stimulating factors (CSFs), which were determined by a combination of human and mouse colony assays, morphological assessment of colony types and neutralization studies with anti-human macrophage CSF (CSF-1) and anti-human granulocyte (G)-CSF to be CSF-1 and G-CSF. The activity in the uninduced and induced monocyte conditioned media (CM) for CFU-GM-type colonies and clusters was attributed to the presence of both CSF-1 and G-CSF, while the activity in the monocyte CM for BFU-E and CFU-GEMM colonies was attributed to the presence of G-CSF. Monocytes were separated by two-color fluorescence using a dye laser flow cytometry system with cells labeled with anti-leu M3 conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-HLA-DR conjugated with phycoerythrin. While \"constitutive\" release of CSFs from monocytes was apparent from both the leu M3+, HLA-DR+ and the leu M3+, HLA-DR- (low density or negative DR) fractions, enhanced release of CSFs in response to rhuTNF-alpha or rhuIFN-gamma was confined to the leu M3+, HLA-DR+ population of cells. RhuTNF-alpha and rhuIFN-gamma synergized to enhance release of CSFs such that low concentrations of each molecule, which were inactive when used alone, were active when the two molecules were used together. These studies suggest a role, at least in vitro, for TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the release of CSFs from cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage.\r"

Its effects on guinea pig adrenal cells in vitro were investigated and compared with those of IgG from three normal subjects and IgG obtained commercially. IgG from the patient inhibited the stimulation of cortisol secretion by adrenocorticotrophic hormone by 77 (SD 2)% and 57 (12)% at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.05 g/l, respectively; IgG prepared five months after she had started treatment with replacement steroids inhibited cortisol secretion by 74 (1)% (0.5 g/l) and 51 (15)% (0.05 g/l). The other IgGs had no inhibitory effects. The IgG from the patient and that obtained commercially did not inhibit the stimulation of cortisol secretion by dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate or precursors of cortisol. None of the IgGs bound to adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These results suggest that the IgG from the patient acted against the receptor for adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and its presence may explain the patient's raised concentrations of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, failure to respond to exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and normal basal cortisol concentrations. Addison's disease may thus in some instances be a receptor antibody disease.\r"

Patients were randomised to three treatment groups: paranormal healing by laying on of hands (n = 40), paranormal healing at a distance (n = 37), and no paranormal healing (controls; n = 38). Healing at a distance and no paranormal healing were investigated double blind. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in all three groups at week 15 (mean reduction (95% confidence interval) 17.1 (14.0 to 20.2)/8.3 (6.6 to 10.0) mm Hg). Only the successive reductions in diastolic blood pressures among the groups from week to week were significantly different. Each week diastolic pressure was consistently lower (average 1.9 mm Hg) after healing at a distance compared with control, but on paired comparison these differences were not significant. Probably week to week variations among the groups accounted for any differences noted. In this study no treatment was consistently better than another and the data cannot therefore be taken as evidence of a paranormal effect on blood pressure. Probably the fall in blood pressure in all three groups either was caused by the psychosocial approach or was a placebo effect of the trial itself.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of maternal fatness on the mortality of infants born preterm up to the corrected age of 18 months 795 mother-infant pairs were studied. Maternal fatness was defined by Quetelet's index (weight/(height] and all infants weighed less than 1850 g at birth. In 771 mother-infant pairs maternal age, complications of pregnancy, mode of delivery, parity, social class, and the baby's sex and gestation were analysed by a logistic regression model for associations with infant mortality (but deaths from severe congenital abnormalities and those occurring during the first 48 hours after birth were excluded). In a subgroup of 284 mother-infant pairs all infant deaths except those from severe congenital abnormalities were analysed in association with the infant's birth weight and gestation and the mother's height and weight; this second analysis included another 24 infants who had died within 48 hours after birth. In the first analysis mortality overall was 7% (55/771), rising from 4% (71/173) in thin mothers (Quetelet's index less than 20) to 15% (6/40) in mothers with grades II and III obesity (Quetelet's index greater than 30). After adjusting for major demographic and antenatal factors, including serious complications of pregnancy, maternal fatness was second in importance only to length of gestation in predicting death of infants born preterm. In the second analysis mortality overall was 15% (44/284), rising from 9% (5/53) in thin mothers to 47% (8/17) in mothers with grades II and III obesity. In both analyses the relative risk of death by 18 months post-term was nearly four times greater in infants born to obese mothers than in those born to thin mothers. In addition, maternal fatness was associated with reduced birth weight, whereas it is associated with macrosomia in term infants. These data differ fundamentally from those reported in full term babies of obese mothers. It is speculated that the altered metabolic milieu in obesity may reduce the ability of the fetus to adapt to extrauterine life if it is born preterm.\r"

In 11 of these compared with nine of the 52 men with normal diastolic pressures their birth weights in relation to gestational age had been below the mean and 1 SD of a comparable Swedish population. The risk of increased diastolic blood pressure in early adult life was significantly higher among men who had been growth retarded at birth than among those whose birth weight had been appropriate for gestational age (odds ratio 3.63; 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 12.57). Being born small for gestational age may be a predictor of raised blood pressure in early adult life.\r"

  ".W": "In a population based cohort study information on the consumption of alcohol was obtained from 95% of the 952 consecutive primigravidas who lived in the Dundee district and attended for antenatal care between May 1985 and April 1986. Before realising that they were pregnant more than 90% drank alcohol and 53% were cigarette smokers. During the first four months of pregnancy, however, the proportion of women drinking and smoking fell to 56% and 44%, respectively. Alcohol consumption of more than 120 g absolute alcohol/week (12 or more standard drinks) during pregnancy was related to shorter gestational age (-2.6 weeks), smaller head circumference (-18 mm), shorter (-21 mm) and lighter (-499 g) babies, and lower Apgar scores at five minutes (-0.4, all p less than 0.01). After adjustment for the effect of smoking, social class, mother's size, and other confounding factors, however, an alcohol intake of more than 120 g/week was significantly related only to shorter gestational age (-2.0 weeks, p less than 0.001) and lower Apgar score at five minutes (-0.2, p less than 0.05). Alcohol intake in the region of 100-119 g/week was significantly related to smaller head circumference (-12 mm, p less than 0.05). Analysis by type of beverage consumed suggested that beer rather than wine or spirits was associated with a poorer outcome. As there was no detectable effect on pregnancy of alcohol consumption below 100 g/week, it is suggested that health education should be directed towards mothers who drink more than this amount.\r"

(Nine months later about a third of all new patients had still not seen a consultant in the clinic.) In the medical clinics just over a quarter of patients were seen by doctors who had less than six months' experience in their present specialty after registration. Overall, doctors had been on continuous duty for at least 24 hours before a third of consultations. Doctors in training had actually worked during the previous night before attending a quarter of the clinics. Much of the large volume of work is performed by tired, incompletely trained doctors. It is suggested that a greater proportion of the work should be performed by fully trained staff. The workload might be reduced by modifying the pattern of the consultation.\r"

Initial pressures recorded by both systems correlated well. Discrepancies in subsequent values were considered to be either due to improper limb positioning or because of catheter damage or obstruction. Both systems are position sensitive, but the problem can be minimized by careful anchoring of the catheters. The fibreoptic catheter is more fragile, but the wick catheter, despite a constant slow infusion of heparinized fluid, is liable to obstruct. While it has proven difficult to compare cost-effectiveness for the two systems, it is our impression that the fibreoptic system offers advantages in terms of ease of placement and maintenance and long-term reliability of measurements. Experience from other burn groups with the two systems will be important. Finally, the parallel use of the two catheters emphasizes the potential fallibility of either system, and the necessity of applying clinical judgement in evaluating circumferentially burned extremities even though direct pressure monitoring is employed.\r"

Mafenide acetate resulted in the lowest incidence of muscle invasion and yielded the lowest mean eschar and muscle concentrations. Mafenide acetate, gentamicin, and chlorhexidine diphosphanilate (0.5 per cent) had lower mean eschar and muscle concentrations than silver sulphadiazine 1 per cent alone. Addition of chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5 per cent or 1.0 per cent) to silver sulphadiazine reduced mean eschar concentrations but not muscle concentrations compared to silver sulphadiazine alone. All treatments effectively suppressed systemic invasion of lung and blood and prevented death compared with controls.

Of five patients receiving the combination of buserelin and flutamide from the beginning of therapy, four patients had a partial remission with a median duration of over 15 months (range, over five to 16). One patient's disease remained stable for 12 months. Major side effects were hot flushes, loss of libido, and impotence. Buserelin initiates a castration-like endocrine response and has potential in the treatment of men with disseminated breast cancer when used either alone or in combination with flutamide.\r"

Patients with primary carcinomas containing high levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity had a significantly shorter disease-free interval than patients with low levels of activity. It is concluded that urokinase-plasminogen activator may be a new prognostic marker in breast cancer.\r"

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was positive in 41.4% of the CAH, in 23.1% of cirrhotic patients, and in 26.2% of HCC. In the latter, HBV DNA assay increased the number of subjects with active HBV infection by about 12%. Alcohol abuse was evenly distributed in all three categories of HBV markers. Males were preferentially affected. The HCC was superimposed on cirrhosis in more than 90% of patients. Our data suggest that, in our epidemiologic setting, different factors (HBV, non-A, non-B agents, alcohol) may cooperate in the development of HCC, mainly through their potential for causing cirrhosis.\r"

Twenty-four weeks after the total proctocolectomy, Na-K ATPase activity and PD increased significantly in all intestinal sites, whereas cyclic AMP showed no significant changes. The regional difference in the remaining intestine was examined in the jejunum, ileum, and interposed jejunum (neorectum). Na-K ATPase activity showed no significant regional difference, but the largest increase was found to occur in the ileum. PD also increased markedly in the ileum and there was significant difference between the ileum and other intestinal sites. These facts suggest that the increased active ion transport mediated by mucosal Na-K ATPase and transmural PD in the ileum is closely related to the intestinal adaptation occurring after total colectomy and indicates a greater potential of the ileum for adaptive compensation than either jejunum or neorectum.\r"

Ten volunteers and five patients with Crohn's disease received 1000 units and 3000 units of heparin intravenously and plasma samples were obtained at timed intervals. Plasma DAO activity increased significantly, compared with basal values, 30 minutes after 3000 units of heparin in both volunteers (26.2 +/- 5.0 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.5 units/ml) and patients with Crohn's disease (14.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 4.0 +/- 1.1 units/ml, P less than .05) and was significantly greater in the volunteers. There was no significant increase in DAO activity after 1000 units of heparin. Plasma DAO activity increased significantly within 15 minutes after 3000 units of heparin and remained at this high level at 60 minutes. Postheparin DAO activity correlated with the integrated area under the DAO activity curve. Plasma DAO activity correlated with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index in the patients with Crohn's disease. Plasma DAO activity, 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of 3000 units of heparin, should reflect intestinal involvement in Crohn's disease.\r"

Evaluated biological factors were species, age at death, source of animals, manner of death, presence of colon cancer, and time after importation. Most normal colons were found in young animals (dead at less than 1 years of age). Nearly all (approximately 96%) animals had colitis; 70-80% of most groups were graded as chronic colitis. Usually, one grade adequately described the condition of the entire colon. The strongest observed correlation of factors (P less than 0.05) was between acute colitis and colon cancer in S. oedipus. A higher percentage of S. oedipus had acute colitis than did the other two species. When colitis incidence data were adjusted for S. oedipus with colon cancer, there were no observed species differences between colons of colony-born and imported animals nor between those that died naturally and those that were euthanized. In an additional group of 18 S. oedipus that were imported in 1975, acute colitis was found in 60% of those dying immediately after importation (less than 1 year of colony age) and those that survived greater than 3 years. At this time, no causative agent has been identified in marmoset colitis.\r"

  ".W": "The highest diamine oxidase activity is contained in small-bowel mucosa and, after heparin administration, the enzyme is released by the intestine into the plasma. Previous experimental studies showed that measurement of plasma postheparin diamine oxidase activity is a sensitive test for quantitating the length and severity of small-bowel mucosal injury. On this basis, we measured plasma diamine oxidase activity in celiac disease, a condition characterized by a loss of mature enterocyte mass. Twenty-five untreated celiac patients, 21 celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, 16 patients with small-bowel diseases other than celiac disease (abnormal controls), and 18 healthy controls were studied. Diamine oxidase activity was measured using [14C]putrescine as substrate and expressed as units per milliliter of plasma. Basal diamine oxidase levels in controls and patients were too low for significant differences between the groups to be detected. After preliminary experiments in which, on separate occasions, heparin was intravenously administered at doses of 75 and 150 units/kg and in which the second blood sample was taken 10 and 30 min after heparin injection, it was decided to use the 150 unit/kg dose and to measure plasma diamine oxidase activity in the blood sample taken 10 min after heparin stimulation in all the remaining subjects taking part in the study. Postheparin diamine oxidase levels were significantly lower in untreated celiac patients (mean 1.53 units/ml) than in healthy controls (mean 5.85), treated celiac patients (mean 4.82), and abnormal controls (mean 2.62). Except in three patients, no overlap between healthy controls and untreated celiac patients was observed. No significant difference was detected between healthy controls and treated celiac patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been suggested that MRI might also reveal functional abnormalities at an interictal epileptic focus when no gross structural change such as gliosis or tumor is present. Experimental epileptic foci were produced by topical application of penicillin to the cortex of rats. In vitro proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry of tissue excised from the experimental foci revealed an increase in spin-echo relaxation time as compared to that in control tissue. The elevated relaxation times occurred in tissue samples from areas of active electroencephalographic (EEG) spiking. This is the first direct demonstration of an alteration in proton magnetic resonance parameters by functional abnormalities (focal interictal spike activity) in the brain, supporting the concept that MRI might be similarly affected.\r"

These findings may be related to ethnic or geographical factors. Rarity of PPD in Africans has previously been attributed to ethnic factors. Other studies have demonstrated an influence of geographical factors, specifically sunshine. In papio papio, such a geographical factor was shown to influence occurrence of PPD. In human epileptic subjects, environmental sunshine has been found to inversely influence the occurrence of PPD as well as SW. Besides possible ethnic factors, the relative rarity of interictal EEG abnormalities in Africans with grand mal epilepsy may be related to the larger amount of sunshine in the tropics.\r"

Variables used for analysis were eight antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and total daily dosages (drug score), and seven background factors consisting of maternal age at delivery, gravida, outcome of previous pregnancy, etiology and type of epilepsy, occurrence of seizures in the first trimester of pregnancy, and seizure frequency during pregnancy. The overall rate of malformation was 14.0%. Thirty-one patients were administered a single drug, and the rate of malformation was 6.5%. The remaining 141 patients were treated with multiple AEDs, and the rate of malformation was 15.6%. The drug score of the latter group was significantly higher than the former (p = 0.01). There was no definite dose-dependent increase in the incidence of malformations associated with any individual AEDs. There was no relationship between the type of defect and individual AEDs. Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed significant association between the drug score, valproate (VPA), and congenital malformation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) also reached an almost significant level. Furthermore, VPA polypharmacy produced the highest incidence of malformation, higher than that produced by any other AED or drug combination. There was no significant association between the presence of malformations and the other putative risk factors. These results suggest that high dose of AEDs reflecting polypharmacy, VPA polypharmacy in particular, are primary factors responsible for the increased incidence of congenital malformation in the offspring of treated epileptic mothers.\r"

Circulating hormones were measured in 53 postpubertal male epileptic patients less than 45 years of age and in an age-matched control group (n = 40), consisting of 14 untreated epileptic patients and 26 unmedicated healthy subjects. A subgroup also underwent a combined gonadotrophin- and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (LH-RH/TRH) pituitary stimulation test. Untreated patients did not differ from healthy subjects for any parameter, and their data were combined for comparison with the treated epileptic patients. Total testosterone (T), androstenedione, and basal follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations were similar in all patient groups. Patients receiving more than one drug had higher sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (p less than 0.01) and lower free T and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHAS) levels (both p less than 0.001) than controls. Carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy also reduced free T (p less than 0.05) and DHAS (p less than 0.001) and increased basal prolactin (p less than 0.01). In these two groups of patients, basal luteinising hormone (LH) was elevated (p less than 0.01), presumably as a pituitary response to increased T catabolism. There was a negative correlation between free T and circulating CBZ (r = -0.54, p less than 0.05) in the monotherapy patients. Phenytoin (PHT) was associated with a rise in SHBG (p less than 0.01) and a fall in DHAS (p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "It has been hypothesized that the critical step in streptozocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell toxicity is the overactivation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase resulting from DNA strand breaks. Overactivation of this enzyme leads to a lethal depletion of its substrate, NAD, in the beta-cell. However, recently it has been shown that a lethal concentration of STZ and a nontoxic concentration of its nitrosoamide moiety methylnitrosourea (MNU) damage beta-cell DNA to the same extent and cause comparable amounts of DNA strand breaks. This study was performed to determine whether STZ and MNU activate poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase to the same extent. Monolayer cultures of islet cells from neonatal rats were exposed to concentrations of MNU and STZ of 10(-3) to 10(-2) M. The results show that both chemicals caused comparable activation of the enzyme at all concentrations tested. These data demonstrate that activation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase alone is not the critical step in STZ-induced beta-cell toxicity. Based on this finding, it appeared possible that STZ may be selectively sequestered into some critical site in the beta-cell other than the nucleus. Therefore, studies were initiated with 14C-labeled STZ and MNU to determine whether STZ might be distributed in the beta-cell differently than MNU. Total cellular DNA and protein from both RINr (clone 38) and islet cell monolayers were separated on hydroxylapatite columns after exposure to 14C-labeled chemicals. The amount of label incorporated into each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and the ratio of label incorporated in protein to that in DNA was determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

F1 mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with either NOD, NON, or F1 bone marrow. Only F1 mice reconstituted with NOD bone marrow developed hyperglycemia. The long (greater than or equal to 16-wk) prodromal period required for expression of overt diabetes contrasted with the rapidity (4-6 days) with which kidney-grafted F1 or NON islets (but not anterior pituitary) were eliminated from diabetic F1 mice. Thus, development of beta-cell-specific immunologic effectors was a chronic process, but once sufficient levels of autoimmunity were achieved, implanted beta-cells could be eliminated in an acute fashion. Thus, expression of NOD diabetogenic alleles in hematopoietic progenitor cells is sufficient for development of anti-beta-cell immunity. The elimination of grafted NON islets shows the effectors are capable of eliminating beta-cells from mice without the diabetogenic genotype.\r"

During static incubations, 2 microM glyburide releases 0.16 pg insulin per beta-cell, which corresponds to a half-maximal glucose stimulation. This effect occurs independently from the glucose-recognition unit, being detectable at both nonstimulatory and stimulatory glucose concentrations and proceeding without alterations in the rate of glucose oxidation. The secretagogue action of glyburide appears not to be mediated through cAMP but is potentiated by cAMP-generating substances such as glucagon (10(-8) M; 0.31 pg insulin released per beta-cell). Its 10-fold higher potency in isolated islets is attributed to the markedly higher cAMP levels that are maintained in islet beta-cells under the influence of locally released glucagon. Perifused pancreatic beta-cells respond to glyburide with a biphasic insulin release. After removal of the drug, the cells continue to secrete insulin at the same rate for greater than or equal to 30 min. This prolonged secretory activity coincides with a cellular accumulation of the drug, primarily in association with membranes of secretory vesicles and mitochondria. Tolbutamide also stimulates insulin release from pure beta-cells, but it is less powerful on a molar basis and does not lead to a sustained hormone release after its removal from the extracellular medium. We conclude that the hypoglycemic action of glyburide is at least partly the result of a direct interaction with pancreatic beta-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pancreatic islet cell allotransplantation on the development of diabetic neuropathy in streptozocin-induced diabetic ACI rats was examined morphometrically with light- and electron-microscopic procedures. Peripheral nerve function was evaluated by nerve conduction velocity and evoked muscle potential amplitude measurements. Diabetes was induced at 4 mo of age, and diabetic animals were transplanted by intracerebral and intraportal grafts 2 wk later. Diabetic animals with accepted grafts returned to euglycemia and showed a normal body-weight gain over the subsequent 14-mo observation period. Transplanted animals with accepted grafts and those in whom graft rejection was induced were compared with age-matched nontransplanted diabetic rats and nondiabetic control rats at 18 mo of age. Successful allotransplantation completely prevented axonal atrophy and the characteristic nodal and paranodal structural abnormalities in diabetic nerve, as well as the typical slowing of nerve conduction velocity. Our data suggest that islet cell allotransplantation is an effective therapeutic approach to the prevention of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

The glucitol-lysine (Glc-Lys) and the glucitol-hydroxylysine (Glc-Hyl) content of diabetic GBM was found to be about twofold higher than that of nondiabetic samples (P less than .001). The content of these glycated amino acids did not correlate with age over the range examined (20-91 yr) or with the length of disease in diabetic subjects (2-16 yr). However, analyses of Glc-Lys and Glc-Hyl in calf and adult bovine GBM and lens capsules indicated that the levels of these glycated amino acids were several times greater in basement membranes from older animals. We also observed that guanidine-insoluble collagen of bovine GBM is more extensively glycated (approximately 4-fold) than primarily noncollagenous proteins that are extracted by this reagent. In all of the basement membranes examined, the percentage of glycation of lysine was greater than of hydroxylysine. Characterization of the components released by alkaline hydrolysis indicated that O-glycosylated hydroxylysine residues are nonenzymatically N-glycated to the same extent as those without an enzymatically attached carbohydrate unit. Our study indicates that more than a hundred times as many hydroxylysine residues are enzymatically glycosylated in human and bovine GBM as those containing the nonenzymatically formed ketoamine adduct.\r"

After 6 days of treatment, the degree of mucosal injury between treatments was compared by endoscopy, using a predetermined rating scale of 0 (normal mucosa) to 4+ (greater than 25 hemorrhages or erosions or an invasive ulcer). Utilizing a score of less than or equal to 2+ (2-10 hemorrhages or erosions) as a therapeutic success, the overall success rates were 8/30 (26.7%) for placebo, 19/30 (63.3%) for cimetidine, and 27/29 (93.1%) for misoprostol (p less than 0.001). Pairwise comparisons were also significant: misoprostol vs. placebo (p less than 0.001), misoprostol vs. cimetidine (p = 0.006), and cimetidine vs. placebo (p = 0.004). A separate analysis of the gastric scores alone revealed success rates identical to those in the overall evaluation; however, success rates in the duodenum for both misoprostol (29/29) and cimetidine (29/30) were extremely high and did not differ. It is concluded that misoprostol is highly effective and significantly better than cimetidine in protecting the gastric mucosa from tolmetin-induced injury; however, both agents were highly protective in the duodenum.\r"

Oxyntic cell canaliculi were labeled by wheat germ, Helix pomatia, and peanut lectins, suggesting a predominance of N-acetylhexosamines. Tubulovesicles were heavily stained by wheat germ, Helix pomatia, and Ricinus communis I lectins, indicative of N-acetylhexosamine- and galactose-containing glycoconjugates. Diffuse oxyntic cell cytoplasmic staining was observed with the mannose-binding lectin concanavalin A. This lectin, along with wheat germ, soybean, Helix pomatia, and Ricinus communis I lectins, bound to oxyntic cell basolateral membranes, indicating mannose, N-acetylhexosamine, and galactose residues. Chief cell apical membranes were labeled with peanut, Ricinus communis I, Helix pomatia, and Ulex europaeus lectins, suggesting a predominance of N-acetylhexosamine, galactose, and fucose residues. None of the lectins demonstrated any significant affinity for chief cell cytoplasm or basolateral membrane. Ulex europaeus agglutinin-binding sites were additionally concentrated in lateral intercellular spaces. The results of this study indicate that the range of utility of isolated rabbit gastric glands can be expanded to include histochemical work. In addition, the data suggest the applicability of lectin affinity chromatography in the isolation and characterization of oxyntic and chief cell membranes and glycoproteins.\r"

To test this hypothesis we have measured serum lipid and apoprotein levels in 18 fasting patients receiving total parenteral nutrition and in a group of 31 normal controls. Measurement of total serum lipids revealed that the patients had significantly higher serum triglyceride levels and lower total serum cholesterol levels than the controls. The lower total serum cholesterol levels were a consequence of decreases in both low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean serum level of apo A-IV in the patients was 15 +/- 13 AU/dl, compared with 93 +/- 29 AU/dl in the controls. This difference was almost threefold greater than the differences between levels of apo A-I, apo B, or lipoprotein subfractions. Moreover, apo A-IV was undetectable in 4 patients who had undergone significant small intestinal resection. A trend toward lower apo A-IV levels was seen in the resected patients as compared with those with intact small intestine. Linear regression analysis showed that levels of apo A-IV were not correlated with any apoprotein or lipoprotein parameter in either the patient or control group, with the exception of a positive correlation between serum apo A-IV levels and total serum cholesterol in the controls only, suggesting that apo A-IV synthesis is regulated independently of the synthesis of the major classes of plasma lipoproteins. We conclude that serum apo A-IV levels are especially sensitive to the interruption of enteral feeding and rapidly fall to very low values during prolonged fasting.\r"

There were no cases of fulminant hepatitis. Nineteen of the 53 patients (36%) with acute posttransfusion hepatitis progressed to chronic hepatitis. Development of chronic hepatitis was not related to the age or sex of the patient, the incubation period of the preceding acute hepatitis, the presence of shock or malignancy, or the number of units of blood transfused. Patients with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase during the acute hepatitis were more prone to develop chronic hepatitis. The finding of 9.2% of transfusion-related hepatitis in recipients of hepatitis B surface antigen-screened blood from volunteer donors underscores the potential sequelae of blood transfusion, especially as a source of contribution to the pool of chronic liver disease.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two hormones, glucagon and dexamethasone, on levels of plasma membrane proteins in rat liver cells during late fetal and early postnatal stages of development. For this purpose, 18-day-old rat fetuses and 1-day-old newborns were treated with glucagon or dexamethasone and killed at 22 days of gestation and 3, 5 and 7 days of age, respectively. Postnuclei liver membranes were isolated using a sucrose gradient method and assessed for levels of specific membrane proteins. Asialoglycoprotein receptor and 110,000 Mr glycoprotein, denoted GP 110, representing the sinusoidal and bile canalicular domains, respectively, were quantitated using the immunoblot method. Membrane enzymes alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and gamma-glutamyl transferase were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The data showed that glucagon and dexamethasone have a differential effect on membrane constituents according to the stage of development. Glucagon increased the levels of membrane enzymes during the late fetal stage but had no effect on liver membrane proteins in the newborn animal. In contrast, although dexamethasone elevated GP 110 in fetal rat livers, none of the other marker proteins was significantly affected. On the other hand, in newborns dexamethasone reduced the amount of asialoglycoprotein receptor and alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase enzyme activities but greatly augmented the level of gamma-glutamyl transferase. Thus, glucagon primarily affects plasma membrane proteins in late gestation while dexamethasone does so during the early postnatal period. The roles that these two hormones may play during ontogeny is discussed with respect to liver development.\r"

Total H+ efflux of freshly prepared hepatocytes ranged from 10 to 15 nmoles per min per mg protein. A part of total H+ efflux (35 to 50%) was dependent on extracellular Na+. This Na+-dependent H+ efflux was (i) inhibited by amiloride with a half-maximal effect at 0.3 mM, (ii) inhibited by ouabain, (iii) dependent on extracellular pH and (iv) characterized by a Km of 15 +/- 3 mM Na+ and a Vmax of 9 +/- 0.07 nmoles per min per mg protein. Amiloride, ouabain and replacement of Na+ by choline also decreased intracellular pH determined from equilibrium distribution of dimethyloxazolidinedione. Li+ could partially substitute for Na+ in Na+-dependent H+ efflux and in maintaining intracellular pH. Efflux of CO2 and lactic acid from hepatocytes represented 80% of Na+-independent H+ efflux. Efflux of H+ in the presence and absence of Na+ was not significantly altered by extracellular Ca++ (less than 10 microM and 1.0 mM). Thus, Ca++/H+ exchange is unlikely to contribute significantly to total H+ efflux from hepatocytes. Cyclic AMP analogs, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and 8-bromo cyclic AMP, inhibited amiloride-sensitive Na+-dependent H+ efflux, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP decreased intracellular pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate whether neopterin levels are elevated in patients with acute viral hepatitis, we measured urinary levels in 13 patients with hepatitis A, 26 with hepatitis B, 12 with non-A, non-B hepatitis, 8 with jaundice and/or cholestasis due to biliary and pancreatic disorders and 3 with alcoholic hepatitis and in 62 apparently healthy HBsAg carriers. Neopterin levels in patients with virus-induced hepatitis were significantly higher than those in patients with other diagnoses. Urinary neopterin levels were above normal in 49 of 51 patients with viral hepatitis and elevations during the course of hepatitis showed a pattern similar to that of the usual liver biochemical tests, suggesting that neopterin levels were related to the clinical activity of the viral disease. In patients with nonviral biliary and hepatic disorders, neopterin levels were usually normal and did not correlate with other liver biochemical tests. These findings suggest that cell-mediated immune mechanisms are activated during viral hepatitis and that neopterin measurement may be of value as an additional surrogate marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

We hypothesized that endothelial factors modulate the sensitivity of baroreceptors during increases in arterial pressure. Baroreceptor activity was recorded from single fibers innervating the isolated carotid sinus of dogs anesthetized with chloralose after removal of the endothelium (balloon denudation) and after replacing into the denuded sinus bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on microcarrier beads. The endothelial cells were activated with either the calcium ionophore A23187 (2 microM) or bradykinin (10 microM). The threshold pressure (n = 7) determined with a slow ramp increase in static pressure averaged 73 +/- 7 (SEM) mm Hg during exposure to naked beads and was increased significantly (96 +/- 18 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) during exposure to endothelial cell cultures. During stepwise increases in pressure, activity (n = 6) averaged 14 +/- 5, 40 +/- 8, and 54 +/- 8 spikes/sec at 75, 125, and 175 mm Hg during exposure to naked beads and decreased significantly to 2 +/- 2, 30 +/- 11, and 35 +/- 12 spikes/sec at equivalent pressures during exposure to the cell cultures. The activity was restored after replacement of the cell cultures with naked beads. The suppressed activity was not caused by changes in carotid sinus diameter or strain (sonomicrometers) or by the chemical activators that were also added to the naked beads. The results indicate that chemically activated endothelial cells release an inhibitory factor that suppresses baroreceptor activity.\r"

On the assumption that a natural ligand for the digitalis receptor should be searched for on the basis of the effects on intact cells, we used an inhibitory effect on the binding of [3H]ouabain to human erythrocytes to determine digitalislike activity. A highly polar [3H]ouabain displacing activity was obtained by a combination of chromatographic procedures including reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Urine-derived [3H]ouabain displacing activity, a competitive inhibitor of ouabain binding to human erythrocytes, acted on human lymphocytes in a similar manner. The dose-response curve of this compound was parallel to that of ouabain. Urine-derived [3H]ouabain displacing activity significantly inhibited monensin-stimulated increase in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake, a parameter of Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), by 95% (p less than 0.01) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (A10 cells). Furthermore, this compound enhanced net 45Ca influx by 30% (p less than 0.01) and reduced 45Ca efflux by 35% (p less than 0.01) in A10 cells. These results suggest that urine-derived [3H]ouabain displacing activity may be a regulator of Na+,K+-ATPase and a modulator of vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "Autoregulation of blood flow in various organ systems is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the net effect of these regional autoregulatory responses on the systemic circulation has not been studied in conscious rats despite the now extensive use of rats in cardiovascular research. The ability of the systemic circulation to autoregulate cardiac output has been proposed to play an important role in the development of increased vascular resistance in volume-dependent forms of hypertension. To better understand these events, we characterized responses to acute increases and decreases in blood volume in conscious areflexic rats that were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous catheters and an electromagnetic flow probe around the ascending aorta. Neurohumoral blockade was achieved with chlorisondamine (10 mg/kg), methscopolamine (0.5 mg/kg), captopril (1.0 mg/kg), and d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg). Mean arterial pressure was restored to normal levels with a constant i.v. norepinephrine infusion, which resulted in normal values of cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and blood gases. Blood volume expansion (0.9 ml i.v. blood infusion for 6 minutes) increased cardiac output 9 +/- 1% and mean arterial pressure 30 +/- 3% and caused a 22 +/- 2% increase in total peripheral resistance (n = 7). Blood volume contraction (6-minute withdrawal of 0.9 ml of blood) decreased cardiac output 12 +/- 1% and mean arterial pressure 26 +/- 4%, which resulted in a 16 +/- 4% decrease in total peripheral resistance (n = 8). The slopes of the pressure-flow relationships during volume expansion were 0.24 and 0.41 during volume contraction, as compared with a nonautoregulating system (slope = 1) and a completely autoregulating system (slope = 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A considerable amount of alpha-hANP-like immunoreactivity was detected in the adrenal medulla (90.8 +/- 21.1 and 90.0 +/- 23.1 ng/g with the two radioimmunoassays), while no detectable amount (less than 1.0 ng/g) was present in the cortex. Gel permeation chromatographic analysis showed that ANP in the medulla is composed of two components of alpha-hANP-like immunoreactivity with high and low molecular weights in the approximate ratio of 2:1, eluting at the elution positions of gamma-hANP and alpha-hANP, respectively. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that alpha-hANP-like immunoreactivity with a low molecular weight in the medulla consists of two major components, which comigrate with synthetic alpha-hANP(5-28) and alpha-hANP. When cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were incubated in the presence of nicotine (10(-5) M), alpha-hANP-like immunoreactivity was released into the medium concomitantly with catecholamines from chromaffin cells. These findings indicate that a discrete ANP system is present in the adrenal medulla and that ANP is cosecreted with catecholamines from chromaffin cells, suggesting the possible involvement of ANP in the adrenomedullary function.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (beta-hANP) is an antiparallel dimer of alpha-human ANP (alpha-hANP) that was isolated from human atria. Using synthetic beta-hANP and a radioimmunoassay for alpha-hANP that also detects beta-hANP, we have previously demonstrated that beta-hANP is converted into alpha-hANP in human plasma in vitro. In the present study, we compared the effects of intravenous administration of beta-hANP (100 micrograms) to five normal human volunteers with those of an equimolar administration of alpha-hANP (50 micrograms) to the same subjects, and we also investigated the possible mechanisms of actions of beta-hANP. Although the administration of alpha-hANP caused a significant decrease in blood pressure with a reactional increase of heart rate, beta-hANP elicited minimal change of blood pressure. In contrast, beta-hANP exerted more potent and longer lasting diuretic and natriuretic activities than did alpha-hANP. Net changes in urine volume and sodium excretion induced by beta-hANP (579 +/- 65 ml, 56.0 +/- 9.9 mEq) were significantly greater than those elicited by alpha-hANP (396 +/- 50 ml, 34.7 +/- 4.9 mEq; p less than 0.05, respectively). The administration of beta-hANP revealed a longer retention of the ANP-like immunoreactivity level in plasma, compared with that of alpha-hANP. High performance gel permeation chromatography coupled with the radioimmunoassay revealed that beta-hANP (Mr = 6000) was also converted into alpha-hANP (Mr = 3000) in human plasma in vivo. The demonstrated conversion of beta-hANP into alpha-hANP could be relevant to the observed effects of beta-hANP in humans.\r"

ES 6864 was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of human renin with a Ki value of 7.3 x 10(-9) M. The compound competitively inhibited human renin. The inhibitor was also potent against monkey renin but was less effective against renins from pig, goat, dog, rabbit, and rat. ES 6864 did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and urinary kallikrein at a concentration of 10(-5) M. ES 6864 was resistant to proteolytic actions of the enzymes in rat tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine). Oral administration of ES 6864 at 30 mg/kg to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets produced a significant blood pressure reduction and almost complete inhibition of plasma renin activity, which persisted for 5 hours. Oral administration of ES 6864 also produced dose-related decreases of blood pressure in hog renin-infused rats, but the duration of action was much shorter than that in conscious marmosets. The parent compound in the blood following oral administration of ES 6864 to marmosets was confirmed directly by measuring the plasma concentration of ES 6864. These results enhance the possibility of developing renin inhibitors that can be used clinically.\r"

The current study tested the hypotheses that 1) release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) into the plasma is impaired in NaCl-loaded SHR, a defect that would tend to elevate blood pressure, and 2) ANF levels in regions of brain involved in blood pressure regulation, such as the anterior hypothalamic area, are altered in SHR. SHR and control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were placed on 1% or 8% NaCl diets at age 7 weeks; 2 weeks later, ANF levels were measured in plasma, left and right atria, anterior hypothalamic area, ventral hypothalamic area, posterior hypothalamic area, pons, and medulla by radioimmunoassay. Blood for ANF assay was obtained from intra-arterial cannulas in conscious, unrestrained rats studied in the resting state. The 8% NaCl diet produced an increase in blood pressure in the SHR, but not in the WKY. Plasma ANF levels were significantly greater in WKY fed 8% NaCl than in WKY fed 1% NaCl, but dietary NaCl loading did not produce similar increases in plasma ANF in the SHR. Plasma ANF levels were not significantly different between SHR and WKY fed the 1% NaCl diet. The observation that dietary NaCl loading stimulated ANF release into the plasma in WKY but not in SHR suggests that the exacerbation in hypertension seen in NaCl-loaded SHR may be related to an impairment in ANF release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atriopeptin II increased the glomerular filtration rate only in kidneys from high NaCl-fed rats, irrespective of their DS or DR status. Superimposition of norepinephrine on atriopeptin II further increased the glomerular filtration rate only in kidneys from low NaCl-fed rats (which had not reacted to atriopeptin II alone), irrespective of their DS or DR status, and did not change the glomerular filtration rate of high NaCl-fed rats. Norepinephrine alone, without atriopeptin II, uniformly decreased the glomerular filtration rate by about 80%. Atriopeptin II increased sodium excretion of high NaCl and low NaCl DR kidneys by more than five times as much as in the corresponding DS kidneys. Therefore, the glomerular filtration rate response to atriopeptin II varied globally with dietary NaCl, independently of genetic predisposition or resistance to NaCl-induced hypertension. The natriuretic response to atriopeptin II was blunted in kidneys from rats genetically susceptible to NaCl-induced hypertension, independently of their NaCl consumption. Atriopeptin II also ameliorated or reversed the adverse effect of norepinephrine on the glomerular filtration rate.\r"

The technique of artificial brain stem perfusion allowed the response to be observed in isolation from the central chemoreflex loop. The data were fitted by an exponential with time delay. During normoxia the mean time constant and time delay (with SD) were 8.6 +/- 7.3 and 3.3 +/- 0.9 s, respectively (9 cats, 56 runs). During hypoxia [arterial PO2 (PaO2) approximately 60 Torr] these values were 6.0 +/- 4.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.9 s (6 cats, 38 runs). In 17 of the 94 runs an augmented breath occurred in the first three breaths after the stepwise increase in PETCO2. For these augmented breaths, tidal volume, inspiratory time, and expiratory time were not different from the next augmented breath occurring in the same run in the steady state. Neither a rate-sensitive component nor a central neural mechanism (central afterdischarge), with the property of maintaining an increased but slowly declining respiratory activity for some minutes after cessation of the PETCO2 challenge, was found. We conclude that the description of the ventilatory response of the peripheral chemoreflex loop to step changes in PETCO2 with a single exponential and time delay is adequate.\r"

Brain pH reached its lowest value after a 15-min exposure to elevated CO2, thereafter slowly and steadily increasing. During recovery brain pH rose rapidly in the first 5 min exceeding control brain pH by 0.08 pH units. Brain pH fell during the next 30 min despite increases in blood pH and decreases in blood CO2 tension. Calculated intrinsic brain buffering rose steadily threefold during the last 40 min of CO2 exposure and during the final 30 min of recovery. These data show that in rat brain there is a temporally late buffering process, most likely active acid extrusion, requiring greater than 30 min for full activation and at least 30 min for discontinuation.\r"

To accomplish this we isolated and then separately pump perfused the pulmonary and systemic circulations, which allowed us to control blood gases in each circuit independently. To ventilate the lungs at a rate and depth determined by central drive, we used an electronically controlled positive-pressure ventilator driven by inspiratory phrenic neural activity. Expiratory time (TE) varied inversely with PpCO2 over the range of PpCO2 from approximately 20 to 80 Torr. VT and TI increased with rising PpCO2 over the range from approximately 20 to 45 Torr but did not change further as PpCO2 was raised above the middle level of approximately 45 Torr. Thus minute ventilation increased as a function of TE and VT as PpCO2 was increased over the lower range and increased solely as a function of TE as PpCO2 was increased over the upper range. The VT-TI relationship shifted leftward on the time axis as PpCO2 was lowered below the middle level but did not shift in the opposite direction as PpCO2 was raised above the middle level. In addition to its effect on breathing pattern, we found that pulmonary hypocapnia depressed inspiratory drive.\r"

The time series obtained exhibited marked periodicities. The frequencies and amplitudes varied between subjects. Peak-to-peak variation was 10-20% of mean values. There was no apparent association between fluctuations in PCO2 and activity other than formal exercise. Visual inspection of the time series and preliminary statistical analysis of digitally converted data suggested that the time-dependent changes of PtcCO2 were normally distributed.

  ".W": "In 12 anesthetized paralyzed dogs, pulmonary gas exchange and intrapulmonary inspired gas distribution were compared between continuous-flow ventilation (CFV) and conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Nine dogs were studied while they were lying supine, and three dogs were studied while they were lying prone. A single-lumen catheter for tracheal insufflation and a double-lumen catheter for bilateral endobronchial insufflation [inspired O2 fraction = 0.4; inspired minute ventilation = 1.7 +/- 0.3 (SD) 1.kg-1.min-1] were evaluated. Intrapulmonary gas distribution was assessed from regional 133Xe clearances. In dogs lying supine, CO2 elimination was more efficient with endobronchial insufflation than with tracheal insufflation, but the alveolar-arterial O2 partial pressure difference was larger during CFV than during CMV, regardless of the type of insufflation. By contrast, endobronchial insufflation maintained both arterial PCO2 and alveolar-arterial O2 partial pressure difference at significantly lower levels in dogs lying prone than in dogs lying supine. In dogs lying supine, the dependent lung was preferentially ventilated during CMV but not during CFV. In dogs lying prone, gas distribution was uniform with both modes of ventilation. The alveolar-arterial O2 partial pressure difference during CFV in dogs lying supine was negatively correlated with the reduced ventilation of the dependent lung, which suggests that increased ventilation-perfusion mismatching was responsible for the increase in alveolar-arterial O2 partial pressure difference. The more efficient oxygenation during CFV in dogs lying prone suggests a more efficient matching of ventilation to perfusion, presumably because the distribution of blood flow is also nearly uniform.\r"

Three groups of subjects representing the high-altitude population mean hemoglobin (Hb), the 10th percentile Hb, and below the 1st percentile were examined to test the hypothesis that the relationship of exercise performance to Hb concentration is similar to those relationships established at low altitude. Anemic individuals (n = 8) had 23% lower voluntary VO2max and 28% lower maximal work loads compared with controls (n = 17) or marginally anemic subjects (n = 12) although the relationship of VO2 to work load was similar. Anemic individuals maintained significantly higher arterial O2 partial pressures and Hb saturations during heavy exercise (90 +/- 0.5 vs. 85 +/- 0.6%) in conjunction with a greater heart rate up to maximal effort. A significantly decreased erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG)-to-Hb molar ratio (0.70 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.06), suggestive of a left-shifted dissociation curve in anemics, is in contrast to the expected right-shifted curve. Moderate anemics were similar to controls. Anemic individuals did not differ in arterial lactate concentration from controls at absolute work loads; anemics had significantly lower arterial lactate concentrations at maximal effort than controls with no differences in the work load-to-lactate relationship. In conclusion, O2 transport during exercise at high altitude seems unaffected by the Hb concentrations as low as the 10th percentile of the population mean.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 15 seriously ill patients with high APACHE scores (greater than or equal to 25) had elevated Therapeutic Intervention Scores and increased mortality compared to the 15 ill patients (APACHE, less than or equal to 10; 67% vs. 27%). Plasma cortisol, aldosterone, and androstenedione concentrations were increased in the ICU patients compared to those in normal subjects (n = 23), being greater in the seriously ill patients. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentrations were low in both groups of ICU patients. The ratios of aldosterone or androstenedione to cortisol were not altered, whereas the DHEAS to cortisol ratios were reduced in the ICU patients. ACTH injection elicited increases in plasma cortisol, aldosterone, and androstenedione concentrations in both groups of ICU patients, and the ratios of aldosterone and androstenedione to cortisol did not change. In the seriously ill patients, plasma DHEAS increased, so that the DHEAS to cortisol ratio did not change, whereas in less ill patients plasma DHEAS did not increase, so that the DHEAS to cortisol ratio was reduced. In this study of patients admitted to an ICU, impairment of adrenal steroid secretion appears to be specific for DHEAS. Although plasma cortisol was elevated in ill patients proportional to the degree of illness, the contribution of the concomitant decrease in DHEAS to this increase is not clear.\r"

We also measured insulin binding to adipocytes. Serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased significantly after 2 days of prednisone administration; the maximal increase was 27% (P less than 0.01 after 5 days). The rise of HDL cholesterol was accounted for by that of HDL2 cholesterol. There were marked changes in the distribution of HDL particles; HDL2 increased, whereas HDL3 decreased. These changes were also apparent after 2 days of prednisone administration and were maximal at 5 days [mean, 1.58 +/- 0.12 (+/- SE) vs. 2.00 +/- 0.14 g/L (P less than 0.001) for HDL2; 1.82 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.61 +/- 0.06 g/L (P less than 0.05) for HDL3], and they were due to opposing changes in cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins in the HDL subfractions. The change in HDL2 protein correlated inversely with that in HDL3 protein (r = -0.73; P less than 0.05). Notably, prednisone did not change the apo A-I concentration, but that of apo A-II decreased (0.32 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.01 g/L; P less than 0.05). Consequently, the lipid to protein ratio of HDL increased. Prednisone induced no significant changes in very low density or low density (LDL) lipoproteins. Adipose tissue LPL activity did not increase until after 7 days of prednisone intake (1.10 +/- 0.28 vs. 3.43 +/- 1.02 mumol FFA/g.h; P less than 0.05), and the same was true for muscle LPL (0.49 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.11 mumol FFA/g.h; n = 4; P = 0.06). Specific insulin binding was normal, but both basal and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport decreased significantly. In summary, prednisone induces changes in serum HDL which are characterized by redistribution of particles within HDL density toward less dense particles and a quantitative rise of lipids in the HDL2 fraction.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the value of vaginal progesterone (P4) in suppressing serum LH concentrations and restoring normal luteal phase serum LH concentrations before administration of exogenous gonadotropins in anovulatory women with the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). P4 (50 mg every 12 h) was administered by vaginal suppository to 9 women (18 cycles) for 14 days before ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and hCG. Serum LH, FSH, estradiol, P4, and PRL levels were measured daily. A biphasic effect on LH secretion occurred during P4 administration. Peak serum LH levels occurred on day 5 (125% of basal levels; P less than 0.05) of vaginal P4 suppository use, followed by a progressive fall (P less than 0.05) to 79% of basal levels, but serum LH levels were still higher than those in normal women despite achieving physiological luteal phase P4 concentrations. Ovulation occurred in 56% of cycles after P4 and hMG/hCG treatment and in 65% of control cycles after hMG/hCG alone. In 7 women, serum LH was measured at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and after vaginal P4 administration for 10 days. LH pulse frequency decreased from 7.4 +/- 1.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.2 pulses/6 h (P less than 0.01), and LH pulse amplitude increased from 3.8 +/- 1.8 to 6.1 +/- 2.9 IU/L (P less than 0.01) after P4 administration. We conclude that vaginal P4 (50 mg every 12 h) 1) produces serum P4 concentrations within the normal range for the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; 2) elevates serum LH, but not FSH, within 5 days; 3) decreases LH pulse frequency and increases LH pulse amplitude after 10 days, but does not normalize serum LH values; and 5) fails to improve the results of subsequent ovulation induction with exogenous gonadotropins in patients with PCOS.\r"

Nine patients had elevated plasma ANH levels compared to normal subjects. The mean plasma ANH concentration [72.5 +/- 13.0 (+/- SE) pg/mL (23.5 +/- 4.2 pmol/L)] in the Cushing's syndrome patients was significantly higher than that in 40 normal subjects [37.6 +/- 1.9 pg/mL (12.2 +/- 0.62 pmol/L)]. A significant positive correlation was found between plasma ANH and cortisol levels in individual patients. There were no significant correlations, on the other hand, between plasma ANH concentrations and PRA, plasma aldosterone levels, or mean blood pressure. After treatment, plasma ANH concentrations decreased in all 6 patients who had elevated plasma ANH levels preoperatively. In 1 patient with Cushing's disease, plasma ANH levels changed in parallel with plasma cortisol concentrations during o,p'DDD treatment. Fifteen patients who were receiving long term synthetic glucocorticoid therapy for the treatment of miscellaneous diseases had a significantly higher mean plasma ANH level [50.2 +/- 4.0 (+/- SE) pg/mL (16.3 +/- 1.3 pmol/L)] than that in normal subjects. These results suggest that plasma ANH levels are elevated in a substantial number of patients with Cushing's syndrome due to either a direct stimulatory effect of glucocorticoid on atrial ANH secretion or, alternatively, intravascular volume expansion resulting from excessive cortisol secretion.\r"

She had previously undergone a hypophysectomy for acromegaly and an enlarged pituitary, with a reduction in her serum GH levels from 100 to 4 micrograms/L. Recurrence of acromegalic symptoms 2 yr later was accompanied by elevated serum GH (16 micrograms/L) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I; 528 micrograms/L) and plasma GHRH levels (12 micrograms/L; normal, less than 30 ng/L). Computed tomographic scan did not reveal pituitary enlargement. Metastatic carcinoid tissue in bone removed at biopsy contained GHRH (100 pg/mg tissue). High performance liquid chromatography of plasma GHRH revealed predominantly GHRH-(3-40)-OH, a biologically inactive GHRH metabolite, along with mature GHRH forms, while carcinoid tissue contained both GHRH-(1-40)-OH and GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. Treatment with pergolide initially resulted in reduction in serum GH and IGF-I levels and amelioration of symptoms of acromegaly. However, after 14 months of pergolide therapy, serum GH levels increased despite administration of up to 1000 micrograms pergolide/day. Plasma GHRH levels remained elevated throughout the treatment period. Subsequent treatment with SMS 201-995, a long-acting somatostatin analog, for over 1 yr resulted in sustained reductions of ectopic GHRH secretion, GH hypersecretion, and IGF-I levels. Plasma GHRH levels correlated with simultaneously measured serum GH levels in response to acute SMS 201-995 administration. SMS 201-995 was an effective medical treatment for acromegaly caused by ectopic GHRH production in this patient.\r"

The women were assigned randomly to receive either a daily nighttime dose of prednisone (100 micrograms/kg) or an alternate nighttime prednisone dose (200 micrograms/kg) for 4 months. During the following 4 months the women received the other schedule. Serum hormone levels were measured 0, 4, and 8 months before and after iv administration of 25 U synthetic ACTH. To optimally compare the daily and alternate day prednisone regimens, hormonal determinations were made on 2 successive days (days 1 and 2) after the last dose of prednisone. We found no evidence for greater suppression of adrenal androgens or lesser suppression of cortisol with alternate day prednisone treatment. Basal serum DHEA and DHEAS concentrations were suppressed to a greater degree than was cortisol during both daily and alternate day prednisone treatments. ACTH-stimulated DHEA and cortisol concentrations were equally suppressed. Only two of the eight women noted improvement in hirsutism during the study, and four women gained weight. Thus, adrenal androgen secretion was more easily suppressed than was cortisol secretion by this low dose of glucocorticoid, but there was no advantage to alternate day therapy.\r"

Synthetic FVIII peptides were examined for the ability to competitively inhibit the binding of C5 to FVIII in an ELISA system. The synthetic FVIII peptide Thr351-Ser365 blocked C5 binding to FVIII in a dose-dependent manner in this system. Two other synthetic FVIII peptides, Asn340-Glu354 and Glu342-Asp356, which partially overlapped Thr351-Ser365, also blocked C5 binding to FVIII. Blocking of C5 binding with these peptides, however, required much greater concentrations (greater than 100 times stronger) than that required for Thr351-Ser365. The Thr351-Ser365 peptide also neutralized the FVIII inhibitory activity of C5 in plasma. A human FVIII inhibitor (anti-FVIII heavy chain alloantibody) was also partially neutralized by Thr351-Ser365. Thr351-Ser365 lies between a thrombin cleavage site (Arg372) and an activated protein C cleavage site (Arg336) and may be at or near a region of functional importance in the expression of FVIII procoagulant activity.\r"

The therapeutic potential of attenuated forms of the lipid-associated glycoprotein tissue factor, a known initiator of coagulation, was investigated as a factor VIII-by-passing activity. The protein moiety of tissue factor (Apo-TF) was partially purified and exhibited minimal procoagulant activity before relipidation in vitro. In pilot studies, Apo-TF injection into rabbits previously anticoagulated with an antibody to factor VIII was found to have a procoagulant effect. The efficacy of the material was further demonstrated when injection of Apo-TF in hemophilic dogs resulted in a normalization of the cuticle bleeding time. Little or no change in the blood parameters associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed at lower doses, although mild to moderate effects were seen at higher doses. These data suggest a novel role for Apo-TF preparations as a potential therapeutic agent for hemophiliacs with antibodies to factor VIII once the potential thrombogenicity of such materials is evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Expressions and functional roles of novel IL-2 binding molecules (p70, 75) in the differentiation of B cells into Ig secreting cells were explored by using human several B cell lines and tonsillar B cells. Affinity-crosslinking studies revealed that five of nine B cell lines expressed p70 and p75 without detectable Tac antigen (p55) expression and the expression was associated with B cell maturation. In tonsillar B cells, small high-density B cells did not express p70 and p75, whereas large low-density B cells, which were thought to be activated in vivo, expressed them. Binding assays of radiolabeled IL-2 showed that the affinity of these molecules was intermediate (kD = 1-3 nM, 700-3,000 sites/cell). Furthermore, high concentrations of IL-2 (greater than 100 U/ml) induced Ig productions in large B cells and two of five cell lines. These results taken together suggest that B cells may express novel IL-2 binding molecules, associated with B cell differentiation and differentiate into Ig secreting cells by IL-2 through novel IL-2 binding molecules.\r"

  ".W": "During biosynthesis of bile acid, carbons 25-26-27 are removed from the cholesterol side-chain. Side-chain oxidation begins either with hydroxylation at the 26-position, in which case the three-carbon fragment is released as propionic acid, or with hydroxylation at the 25-position, in which case the three-carbon fragment is released as acetone. We have previously shown in the rat that the contribution of the 25-hydroxylation pathway can be quantitated in vivo by measuring production of [14C]acetone from [14C]26-cholesterol. In the present study, we adapted this method to human subjects. 4 d after oral administration of 100 microCi of [14C]26-cholesterol and 1 d after beginning a constant infusion of 16.6 mumol/min unlabeled acetone, three men and two women underwent breath collections. Expired acetone was trapped and purified as the 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative. 14CO2 was trapped quantitatively using phenethylamine. Specific activity of breath acetone was multiplied by the acetone infusion rate to calculate production of [14C]acetone. [14C]Acetone production averaged 4.9% of total release of 14C from [14C]26-cholesterol, estimated by 14CO2 output. The method was validated by showing that [14C]acetone production from [14C]isopropanol averaged 86.9% of the [14C]-isopropanol infusion rate. We conclude that in man, as in the rat, the 25-hydroxylation pathway accounts for less than 5% of bile acid synthesis.\r"

The use of the CO2 laser as the only cutting tool eliminates many of the most common and the most serious complications of blepharoplasty attributable to hemorrhage and hematoma. The transconjunctival approach yields superior cosmetic results to those of the more commonly performed traditional techniques, which sometimes results in unacceptable lower eyelid scars and/or lower eyelid retraction. Patient rehabilitation to normal activity is rapid because of decreased bruising and swelling. The laser procedure is well suited to the office-based laser surgical practice, but requires a high degree of skill in CO2 laser excisional surgery. In the hands of the inexperienced operator, new and serious complications may occur.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of intracoronary thrombus and the effects of thrombolytic therapy were studied in 41 patients with unstable angina. All patients underwent coronary angiography 2 to 69 h (mean 19) after their last attack of chest pain. Immediately after angiography, 21 patients received intracoronary streptokinase (250,000 IU in 45 min) and were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (100 mg in 3 h) and were involved in a prospective study. Eleven of the 21 patients from the streptokinase group and 11 of the 20 patients from the rt-PA group showed a decrease in the severity of the coronary stenosis on repeat angiography 1 day later. A decrease in coronary obstruction was primarily observed in 10 of 13 patients with a complete stenosis and in 6 of 9 patients with a subtotal stenosis and markedly diminished coronary flow. Improvement in coronary anatomy was not determined by the clinical characteristics of the patients. Twenty-eight of the 41 patients had angiographic evidence of intracoronary thrombus formation before and 16 had such evidence after thrombolytic treatment. Nine patients developed a small increase in serum cardiac enzymes before or during treatment. Ischemic symptoms and the incidence of surgical or angioplastic intervention were not different in patients with or without a reduction in coronary artery stenosis after fibrinolytic therapy. These observations suggest a high incidence of coronary thrombosis in patients with unstable angina. The data do not permit assessment of the clinical therapeutic efficacy of thrombolytic therapy. Better risk stratification and placebo-controlled prospective studies are required to obtain information on the risk/benefit ratio of such therapy in unstable angina.\r"

  ".W": "Suspensions of enzymatically dispersed human lung parenchymal mast cells were fractionated according to density by flotation through discontinuous Percoll gradients and examined for their responsiveness to release stimulants and pharmacologic agonists. Mast cells localized to all six density fractions (I-VI) examined: densities varied from specific gravities of 1.053 gm/ml to 1.123 gm/ml. Most (67%) lung mast cells localized to fractions III and IV, corresponding to specific gravities of 1.077 to 1.088 gm/ml, respectively. Histamine content increased with density from 2.7 +/- 0.3 pg per cell in fraction 1 to 4.8 +/- 0.7 pg per cell in fraction VI (mean +/- SEM; n = 19). Fraction III was least responsive to high concentrations of anti-IgE than to any other fractions and, along with fraction IV, the most responsive to ionophore A23187. All fractions released the arachidonate mediators prostaglandin D2 and leukotriene C4 in response to anti-IgE. In four of eight lungs tested, formyl methionine peptide (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) weakly elicited histamine release (3% to 6%) in fractions I and II cells. Compound 48/80 (0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml; n = 3) failed to induce histamine release in any fractions. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-active drugs, isoproterenol (10(-4) mol/L), dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (3 mmol/L), and isobutylmethylxanthine (3 X 10(-4) mol/L) inhibited anti-IgE-induced histamine release from all fractions equivalently. Dimaprit (3 X 10(-5) mol/L) and cromolyn sodium (10(-5) -3 x 10(-3) mol/L) failed to significantly inhibit any fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequently, the influence of this subcutaneous dosage regimen was compared with three other regimens that administered the same total daily dose: 20 mg every 8 h, 30 mg every 12 h, and 60 mg every 24 h. Renal injury was assessed by measuring inulin clearance and in vivo synthesis of renal DNA and by histopathology. Cochlear histology was also assessed. The number of P. aeruginosa per abscess was quantitated. In animals with infected abscesses, there was a consistent trend of greater kidney injury with the more-frequent dosage regimens. There was no evidence of cochlear toxicity in any group. All regimens were equally effective in reducing the number of P. aeruginosa in subcutaneous abscesses.\r"

We prepared monoclonal antibodies to astrovirus type 2 antigen and selected them on the basis of group antigen reactivity. The antibodies were reactive with the four astrovirus serotypes that we could cultivate, as well as with the Marin County strain of astrovirus. A previously reported cell-cultivated astrovirus type 3 also reacted with the monoclonal antibodies. These monoclonal antibodies, and the finding of group reactivity among the human astroviruses, should facilitate studies on the importance of these viruses as agents of viral gastroenteritis.\r"

TSST-1 production was enhanced by adding ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) at appropriate concentrations to brain-heart infusion and beef-heart medium. The magnitude of this effect depended both on the number of bacteria used to inoculate the media and on the sampling time. Large inocula prepared in media containing high levels of Mg++ introduced sufficient Mg++ to the growth medium to influence subsequent bacterial multiplication and toxin production. Small inocula of bacteria washed in Mg++-deficient medium before inoculation did not, however, multiply or produce toxin in Mg++-deficient medium. Maximal toxin expression occurred during late logarithmic phase, regardless of Mg++ concentration, and Mg++ appeared to control when late logarithmic stage of growth would be achieved. The toxin-enhancing effect of EDTA was reversed by adding excess Mg++ to treated medium.\r"

It is unknown whether late administration of this agent is safe. Therefore, the effect of indomethacin administration during the late phase of coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Forty 3-week-old CD1 mice each received a 3 x 10(4) median tissue culture-infective dose of coxsackievirus intraperitoneally. On day 10 of infection, mice were randomized to receive either indomethacin or normal saline solution for 10 days, and 10 mice from each group were killed on days 20 and 30 of infection. Heart weight and size and serum atrial natriuretic peptide were similar in both groups on days 20 and 30. On day 20, pathologic scores for the degree of inflammation and necrosis were 1.7 and 1.0 for the indomethacin group versus 1.4 and 1.7 for the saline solution group. On day 30, pathologic scores were 0.3 and 0.6 for the indomethacin group versus 0.5 and 0.6 for the saline solution group. In addition, mineralization was absent in indomethacin-treated animals on day 20 after infection, but it was present in half of the control animals at that time. The degree of mineralization did not differ on day 30 between the two groups. These findings suggest that indomethacin given in the late phase of coxsackievirus myocarditis has no deleterious effects at 30 days.\r"

To examine these risk factors, the device was placed in three groups of five dogs. Group 1 served as controls, with filter placement only. Groups 2 and 3 received anticoagulants before surgery. Group 3 was additionally given a continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator begun immediately after filter insertion. Animals were killed after a 6-hour period of observation and measurement. A second phase was carried out at autopsy in group 3: intracaval pressure was augmented and its effects on caval integrity noted. During the period of observation there were no significant decrements in central venous pressure or hematocrit. At autopsy, no evidence of caval hemorrhage and no caval perforations were found. Increased intracaval pressure did not alter these findings. These results support the clinical experience with the device, and suggest that the risk of acute hemorrhage from a properly seated filter is minimal, even with concurrent use of heparin and thrombolytic agents or high caval pressures.\r"

  ".W": "Thiotepa is an established alkylating agent whose pharmacokinetics in standard doses are well defined. In order to ascertain whether dose-dependent variations in pharmacokinetics occur, we have undertaken an analysis of plasma thiotepa levels in 16 patients entered on a phase I-II study of bialkylator chemotherapy. High-dose thiotepa (1.8 to 7.0 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (2.5 g/m2) were administered intravenously (IV) on days -6, -4, and -2 followed by autologous marrow reinfusion on day 0. Plasma and urinary thiotepa was assayed by gas chromatography. Biexponential plasma decay curves were seen in ten patients, with a t 1/2 alpha of 10.0 +/- 6.4 minutes, a t 1/2 beta of 174 +/- 61 minutes and a total body clearance of 379 +/- 153 mL/h/kg (mean +/- SD). Six patients displayed monoexponential plasma decay curves with a terminal t 1/2 of 137 +/- 83 minutes and a total body clearance of 440 +/- 195 mL/h/kg. Although there was a trend toward reduced plasma clearance in the three patients treated at the highest dose level, the available data suggest that metabolic clearance mechanisms for thiotepa were not saturated with the doses used in this study. By stepwise regression analysis, linear functions using only 15-minute and four-hour postinfusion plasma levels were derived that correlated closely with area under the plasma concentration X time curves (AUC) (P less than .002). We conclude that high-dose thiotepa results in similar pharmacokinetic values to conventional doses with no apparent dose-dependent variation. The value of specific time points to predict AUC and clearance will require prospective evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the alteration of endothelium-dependent responses in chronic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), experiments were carried out in the double-hemorrhage canine model. After the presence of vasospasm was confirmed by cerebral angiography on Days 0 and 7, pharmacological studies on the basilar artery were conducted in vitro on Day 8. In the SAH group, endothelium-dependent relaxation was abolished in response to arginine vasopressin and was significantly reduced in response to thrombin. Endothelium-independent relaxation in the SAH group was preserved in response to papaverine and was minimally reduced in response to sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent contraction in response to arachidonic acid, acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, adenosine diphosphate, mechanical stretching, and hypoxia persisted in the SAH group. The maximal contraction to KCl and uridine triphosphate, which is endothelium-independent, was diminished in the SAH group, but not changes in sensitivity were noted in the concentration-response relationships. A significant correlation was observed between the degree of vasospasm determined angiographically and the loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the persistence of endothelium-dependent contraction suggest that the deterioration in the endothelium-dependent responses may be an important component in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "The nature of vascular permeability factor (VPF) activity derived from serum-free conditioned medium containing cultured human malignant glial tumors has been further investigated. A 1000-fold purification was accomplished by sequential heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography steps. Vascular permeability factor activity falls into a molecular weight range of 41,000 to 56,000 D. Activity is bound to hydroxylapatite, carboxymethyl-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and heparin-Sepharose, whereas little or no activity was bound to diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel. Vascular permeability factor activity is trypsin- and pepsin-sensitive but is unaffected by treatment with ribonuclease A. This suggests that VPF is a hydrophobic, positively charged (cationic) polypeptide with a potentially biologically significant affinity for heparin. As most proteins are negatively charged (anionic) and have no affinity for heparin, a significant advantage was gained by performing these purification steps. The activity of VPF is not inhibited by coinjection of conditioned medium with soybean trypsin inhibitor; or hexadimethrine (both known antagonists of tissue plasminogen activator, Hageman factor, and serum kallikrein); or aprotinin (an antagonist of both plasmin and tissue kallikrein); or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (a serine esterase (elastase) inhibitor); or pepstatin-A (an acid protease inhibitor which inactivates vascular permeability-inducing leukokinins). These data, together with the fact that VPF is produced and released into serum-free media, provides substantial evidence against it being one of the more commonly known serum-derived permeability mediators. Treatment with dithiothreitol inhibited VPF activity, indicating the presence of at least one essential disulfide bond in this molecule. Inhibition by dexamethasone of VPF expression in cultured malignant glial cells appears to be selective. Dexamethasone-induced inhibition of VPF was dose-responsive and was not associated with a parallel inhibition of cellular protein synthesis as determined by tritiated leucine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Inclusion of dexamethasone in the culture medium was not associated with altered cell viability or cell number. A series of in vivo studies confirmed the inhibition of VPF activity in test animals pretreated with dexamethasone. This steroid-induced inhibition was partially reversed by treatment of test animals with actinomycin D prior to exposure to dexamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), labeled with 131I(1.1 to 6.2 mCi) by the iodogen method, was administered intravenously to 15 patients with various soft-tissue malignant tumors after blocking of thyroidal radioiodine uptake. Gamma camera imaging was performed 4 and 24 hr after injection; three patients were also imaged 5 days following injection. We observed accumulation of radioactivity in primary and secondary lesions in 11 patients. In this preliminary study we did not detect any definite association between the magnitude of uptake and type of tumor. Tumors were usually visualized already after 4 hr but the uptake was more intense at 24 hr. The target-to-nontarget ratios at 24 hr, determined by computer analysis of stored images, varied from less than 1.2 to 2.1. This is the first demonstration of accumulation of radiolabeled tPA in malignant tissue. We do not know the mechanism of the uptake but because tPA is known to be avidly bound to fibrin, a component of the stroma of many malignant tumors, it is possible that [131I]tPA is bound to fibrin rather than taken up by the malignant cell; various possible cell uptake mechanisms are discussed. Due to the relatively early maximal uptake of this radiopharmaceutical it will be possible to substitute 123I for 131I, a possibility suggesting a potential clinical use of radioiodinated tPA for the detection of malignant tumors of various origin.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to characterize the in vivo behavior of [99mTc] low density lipoprotein (LDL), biodistribution studies were performed in normal and hypercholesterolemic (HC) rabbits. In normal rabbits, 24 hr after the injection of [99mTc]LDL, 99mTc activity accumulated mainly in adrenal glands, spleen, liver, and kidney. In HC rabbits, however, there was a marked reduction of 99mTc activity in these organs. In both normal and HC rabbits, less than 17% of 99mTc activity appeared in the 24-hr urine following injection of [99mTc]LDL, suggesting that in vivo, [99mTc]LDL is trapped and accumulated within the tissues. Direct comparison of [99mTc]LDL, 125I-native-LDL and [131I]tyramine cellobiose-LDL (the previously validated trapped radioligand) in normal rabbits, demonstrated that the biodistribution of [99mTc]LDL was similar to that of [131I]tyramine cellobiose-LDL. The adrenal glands, liver, and spleen accumulated significantly greater quantities of 99mTc and 131I activity per gram of tissue than 125I (from native-LDL). In addition, imaging studies in monkeys, showed that the hepatic uptake and retention of [99mTc] LDL was similar to that of [131I]tyramine cellobiose LDL. In contrast, radioiodine from native-LDL was deiodinated in liver with subsequent excretion into the intestine. These results suggest that [99mTc]LDL acts as a trapped ligand in vivo and should therefore, be a good tracer for noninvasive quantitative biodistribution studies of LDL.\r"

Rats were fed ad libitum (AL) or were chronically restricted (CR) to 50% of AL intake for 28 d before ovulation was assessed and then until implantation and fetal viability were measured. In the ovulation groups, corpora lutea were counted at estrus. In the implantation groups, blastocyst implantation sites were quantified by using Pontamine Blue dye at d 5 of pregnancy. In the viability groups, live and dead fetuses and metrial nodes were counted at d 18 of pregnancy. CR rats had 74% as many corpora lutea as AL rats; however, fecundity did not differ between dietary treatments. CR rats had 71% as many blastocyst implantation sites and 65% as many viable fetuses as AL rats. Chronic malnutrition negatively affected weight gain before and during pregnancy as well as reproductive performance. These findings help to explain why CR rats have fewer progeny.\r"

We investigated the vasodilatory effect of furosemide and its relation to endogenous prostaglandins (PGs). In the isolated canine lung lobe, furosemide significantly decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure. This effect was inhibited by indomethacin. Furosemide also attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to the endoperoxide analog U46619 and PGF2 alpha. The pulmonary pressor response to a submaximal constrictor dose of arachidonic acid was significantly enhanced by furosemide, however, the pressor response to a maximal constrictor dose of arachidonic acid was attenuated, although not significantly. In animals pretreated with indomethacin, furosemide had no effect on the vascular response to PGF2 alpha, but the response to U46619 was significantly increased. Prostacyclin reduced pulmonary perfusion pressure and inhibited the pressor response to PGF2 alpha and U46619. Furosemide failed to alter inactivation of PGE2 on pulmonary lobe transit. We conclude that: 1) the vasodilatory activity of furosemide is mediated by increased production and not decreased metabolism of an endogenous cyclooxygenase product; 2) the effect of prostacyclin on vascular reactivity is similar to that of furosemide; and 3) local formation of prostacyclin by vascular tissue most likely mediates the vascular activity of furosemide.\r"

Pentobarbital produced a similar shift plus an increase in maximum response. Diazepam, flurazepam and desalkylflurazepam also enhanced GABA-gated Cl- flux. Their effects were blocked by Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Acute diazepam pretreatment caused a shift to the left of the GABA dose-response curve but had no effect on the ability of benzodiazepines or pentobarbital to increase GABA-gated Cl- influx. In rats made tolerant by 4 weeks of flurazepam treatment, there was no decrease in the ability of GABA to mediate Cl- flux. GABA was more potent in microsacs from nonwithdrawn rats. In rats withdrawn for 12 but not 48 hr, the maximum GABA response was increased. The ability of benzodiazepines and of pentobarbital to enhance GABA-gated Cl- influx was reduced, showing tolerance. However, 2 days after withdrawal from chronic treatment, this was no longer statistically significant. The results show that benzodiazepine tolerance involves reduced functional coupling between the benzodiazepine recognition site and the GABA recognition site-Cl- channel. Furthermore, reduced effectiveness of GABAA agonists in benzodiazepine-tolerant animals might result from alterations in neuronal activity that occur subsequently to activation of the GABA receptor-gated anion channel.\r"

To assess the neurochemical basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with lorazepam, 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days, a course which produces tolerance and downregulation of receptor binding and function. Behavioral studies indicated that open-field activity in lorazepam-treated mice was similar to controls at 1 day postlorazepam. Activity was increased at 4 days postlorazepam, and had returned to control levels by day 7. Benzodiazepine receptor binding as measured by specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788 in several brain regions returned to control levels by day 2 postbrazepam but had increased above controls at day 4 postlorazepam. Binding returned to control levels by day 7. Similar results were observed using [3H]flunitrazepam in membrane preparations. A similar time course was also observed for the maximum binding of the chloride channel ligand t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate during this period. The IC50 value for muscimol inhibition of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding was decreased at day 4, suggesting increased coupling between gamma-aminobutyric acid and the chloride channel. Muscimol-stimulated [36Cl-] up-take in cortical synaptoneurosomes was increased at day 4 postlorazepam. These results indicate that the benzodiazepine discontinuation syndrome is associated with upregulation of receptor binding and function at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex.\r"

In this study, we compared the renal vasodilating and diuretic effects of renal arterial infusions of rat atriopeptin II in anesthetized dogs to see if natriuresis and increases in total renal blood flow were associated. The vasodilators substance P and bradykinin also were tested. Volume (V), Na+ and K+ concentration and Na+ and K+ content (UNaV; UkV) of urine from the infused and contralateral kidneys (IK; CK) were measured as well as mean total renal blood flow (RBF) of the IK. Atriopeptin II (30-1000 ng/kg/min) slightly promoted RBF by up to 20%, but raised V, UNaV and UkV by a maximum of 79, 190 and 100%, respectively. Substance P (0.01-30 ng/kg/min) raised RBF of IK by a maximum of 59%, reduced mean blood pressure by 26% and had a biphasic effect on IK excretion: V, UNaV and UkV were increased maximally by 105, 154 and 42% at 1.0 ng/kg/min, whereas progressively less diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis occurred at higher (hypotensive) doses. CK excretion was unchanged. Bradykinin (1-100 ng/kg/min) raised RBF, V, UNaV, and UkV of IKs by a mean maximum of 97, 70, 201 and 47%, respectively, with no changes in mean blood pressure or CK excretion. The natriuretic and hyperemic effects of nonhypotensive doses of each peptide were significantly correlated. However, atriopeptin II uniquely promoted Na+ excretion, but not RBF at the lowest dose tested, and, after 10 min washout of the 1000-ng/kg/min dose, and did not appreciably promote RBF after 10 min of infusion.

Unilateral microinjections of specific mu (DAGO), delta (DPDPE) and kappa (U-50,488H) ligands into the substantia nigra pars reticulata of rats produced dose-dependent contralateral turning. The opiate antagonist naloxone blocked these effects, suggesting that the circling was mediated through opiate receptors. The involvement of midbrain dopaminergic systems in this behavior was tested in two ways. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle decreased the circling produced by DPDPE and DAGO but increased the circling produced by U-50,488H. In contrast, activating dopaminergic systems with systemic injections of amphetamine increased the circling produced by DAGO and DPDPE but had no effect on the circling produced by U-50,488H. These findings suggest that kappa opioids exert opposite effects on locomotion: motor activation through the SNR and motor inhibition through actions in the SNC. Furthermore, the data suggest that the actions of kappa opioids in the SNC are opposite to those produced by mu and delta opioids.\r"

In a second system, a bioassay superfusion cascade procedure was employed to compare the relaxant effects and biologic stability of EDRF and NO. Acetylcholine and bradykinin elicited concentration-dependent but transient relaxant responses in arterial and venous rings, respectively. NO and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, which generates NO in solution, elicited similar transient relaxant responses in endothelium-denuded arterial and venous rings. Glyceryl trinitrate, however, produced sustained relaxations, as did isoproterenol and prostacyclin. Utilizing a bioassay superfusion cascade system in which intact perfused artery or vein was the source of EDRF and three endothelium-denuded arterial or venous strips mounted in series served as the detector of EDRF or NO, the relaxation profile and biologic stability of superfused EDRF were compared with those of superfused NO. Arterial or venous perfusion with acetylcholine or bradykinin, respectively, and superfusion of NO over the strips produced characteristic decremental relaxant responses in the three vascular strips and revealed the highly unstable nature of EDRF and NO (T1/2 = 3-5 sec for both). The relaxation profile of EDRF was indistinguishable from that of NO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sensitivity of their platelets to adenylate cyclase stimulators or to dibutyryl cyclic AMP has been evaluated contemporarily. In 4 of the 30 volunteers tested no inhibition of platelet aggregation was obtained with any of the five thromboxane synthase inhibitors: these subjects were defined nonresponders; in 13 volunteers inhibition was observed with all the five drugs (responders). Significantly higher amounts of prostaglandin (PG)D2, prostacyclin and adenosine were required to suppress arachidonic acid-induced aggregation of platelets from nonresponders in vitro. No differences were instead observed between responders and nonresponders concerning platelet sensitivity to forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The cyclic AMP rise obtained with exogenous prostacyclin was lower in platelets from nonresponders than in those from responders. PGE2 added in vitro to platelets from nonresponders exerted always a proaggregatory effect whereas this PG was antiaggregatory in most of the nonresponders. PGE2 blunted the antiaggregatory activity of PGD2 and limited the cyclic AMP increase induced by PGD2 in all the subjects tested. These data indicate that the unequal functional response of platelets from different subjects to thromboxane synthase inhibition depends essentially on adenylate cyclase function: a relative insensitivity of this enzyme to activating stimuli and the accumulation of substances (PGE2, PG endoperoxides, etc.) reducing the activity of adenylate cyclase may lead to continued platelet activation in some subjects despite the suppression of the synthesis of thromboxane A2.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to analyze potential interactions between voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers and endothelium-dependent vascular responses. Rings of canine femoral artery were suspended for isometric force recording in organ chambers and contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Removal of the endothelium had no effect on relaxations induced by d-cis-diltiazem (active stereoisomer), verapamil or nimodipine. When rings with endothelium were first partially relaxed with acetylcholine or the calcium ionophore A23187 the concentration-relaxation curve to d-cis-diltiazem (but not to verapamil or nimodipine) was significantly shifted to the right. Partial relaxation of femoral arterial rings without endothelium by sodium nitroprusside had no effect on relaxations evoked by diltiazem. Pretreatment with diltiazem (10(-6) M) had no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine in femoral artery rings. D-cis-Diltiazem partially reversed the relaxation induced by acetylcholine in a bioassay system, in which a ring of canine coronary artery without endothelium was superfused by solution passing through a segment of femoral artery with endothelium. D-cis-Diltiazem relaxed the bioassay ring when infused downstream of the perfused femoral artery with, or upstream of a femoral artery without endothelium. The effect of diltiazem was stereoselective (the less active l-cis-diltiazem had no effect). Verapamil did not reverse the relaxation induced by acetylcholine and did not affect the reversal induced by diltiazem. These findings indicate that diltiazem specifically antagonizes the production and/or the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) stimulated by acetylcholine or A23187 in canine femoral arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results were compared to similar studies reported in normal subjects. Primed-continuous infusion of 15N glycine was used and the isotopic enrichments in urinary urea and ammonia were measured. The end product average values were used in the calculation of whole body protein turnover. After 10 days of nutritional support in cancer and noncancer patients whole body protein breakdown decreased by 50% (p = 0.01), and 59% (p = 0.001), whereas protein synthesis decreased by 21% (p = 0.005) and 33% (p = 0.025), respectively. Protein turnover did not change in noncancer patients but increased by 15% (p = 0.005) in cancer patients. The efficiency of utilization of the endogenous supply of amino acids from the breakdown of body proteins for synthetic purposes was 77% in this group of subjects. The utilization efficiency of the intravenously infused amino acids for synthesis of body protein was 39% in cancer and noncancer patients but 51% (p less than 0.05) in normals. The data suggest that depleted patients synthesize proteins from intravenous amino acids less well than normals.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical data were studied in 18 patients with severe acute pancreatitis receiving lipid associated with total parenteral nutrition. The mean nonprotein energy intake was 30 kcal/kg/day, with 34-70% of the nonprotein calories as lipid. These parameters were no different between patients who survived and those who died. The mean sum of Ranson criteria was significantly higher in patients who died as compared with those who survived. Plasma triglycerides, glucose, albumin, and the amount of insulin supplementation were related to the severity of the disease and to the outcome. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, and higher insulin requirements were observed in patients who died in comparison with those who survived and this appeared to be an index of fatal outcome. These abnormalities reflect in part an inability to utilize nonprotein energy, because the measured energy expenditure in relation to intake was lower in the patients who died, despite comparable intakes and expected energy expenditures.\r"
