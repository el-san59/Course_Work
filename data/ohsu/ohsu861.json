  ".W": "Incidence rates of aplastic anemia (AA) are rare among defined populations. Since June, 1984, a cooperative group, including 83 University medical centers throughout metropolitan France, prospectively recorded new cases of AA and followed them up. Inclusion criteria were: at least two depressed blood cell lineages (hemoglobin less than or equal to 10 g/100 mL and reticulocytes less than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L, granulocytes less than or equal to 1.5 x 10(9)/L, platelets less than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/L) and a bone marrow biopsy compatible with the disease. Between May, 1984, and April, 1987, 292 cases were recorded. After exclusion of constitutional disease, 27 patients did not satisfy the inclusion criteria with relation to either bone marrow or blood evaluations and seven patients were initially misdiagnosed (shown in the follow-up), leaving 250 confirmed AA cases in the register. The annual incidence in France appeared to be about 1.5 per million inhabitants. The sex ratio of AA cases was similar to that of the population. In men, two peaks of incidence were observed: one between 15 and 30 years and one after 60 years. In women, the only peak was observed after 60 years. An excess of cases was observed in small towns but not in rural areas. About two of every three cases had severe AA, with a possible excess in younger cases. Based on a minimum follow-up of 1 year for 238 patients, the fatality rate was estimated at 17% at 3 months after diagnosis and at 34% at 1 year. Among 243 suspected etiologies reported by the physicians, 74% were declared idiopathic, 13% presumably associated to drug toxicity, and 5% related to hepatitis. AA appears to be a rare and severe disease in metropolitan France, often of unknown origin, a fact that emphasizes the necessity of controlled etiologic studies.\r"

For this purpose, the high-molecular-mass fibrin degradation products (HMM-XDP) were isolated from malignant ascitic fluid by protamine sulfate precipitation and further purified by gel filtration and acid precipitation. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, the peptide chain components were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The nature of these components was elucidated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and compared with fibrin-derived fragments formed in vitro. The results indicate that plasmin is the essential protease involved in the degradation of the stroma-derived fibrin portion found in ovarian cancer ascites.\r"

Mutations involving either codons 11, 12, or 13 of the N-RAS gene were identified in 18 of the 161 patients. The relative frequencies of N-RAS gene mutations in these hematologic disorders was as follows: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 15%; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 14%; myelodysplastic syndromes, 24%; and myeloid and lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 3%. No correlation was observed between the presence of mutations and cytologic features or immunophenotype of these malignancies. Mutations involving codons 12 or 13 were equally prevalent, with a glycine to aspartic acid substitution being the most frequently encountered change. A single T-ALL case had a codon 11 mutation resulting in substitution of alanine with threonine. We failed to find mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the K-RAS or Ha-RAS genes in any case except a single AML with a mutation in codon 61 of the K-RAS gene. Also, no mutations were identified in chronic phase of CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ph1 positive ALL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, or multiple myeloma. These results indicate that RAS mutations, especially those involving exon 1 of the N-RAS gene, are frequent only in a subset of hematologic malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Erythrocyte CR1, a C3b/C4b-binding complement-regulatory protein, is sensitive to proteolysis in vitro. To test the hypothesis that in vivo erythrocyte CR1 reduction results from intravascular proteinase activities, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure gamma-crosslinked fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) as indicators of coagulation/fibrinolytic activity, and complexes of neutrophil elastase with alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (E/A) as indicators of neutrophil enzyme release in malignant and inflammatory disorders. Erythrocyte CR1, measured by monoclonal anti-CR1 antibody binding, was inversely related to disease activity and blood proteinase markers. Levels of erythrocyte CR1 were significantly lower for patients with active versus remittent squamous and small cell lung cancers, Hodgkin's and diffuse large cell lymphomas, and acute myelogenous leukemias. In patients with active thoracic cancers, elevated D-dimer levels correlated with reduction of CR1. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, CR1 reduction was correlated with elevated levels of elastase complexes. Our findings substantiate the relationship of acquired CR1 reduction to the activity of certain diseases and provide circumstantial support for the hypothesis that erythrocyte CR1 is lost to proteolysis in vivo. Although heritable differences in CR1 expression reduce the interpretability of single measurements of erythrocyte CR1 levels, disease-associated CR1 reduction may be a useful indicator of disorders with chronically increased blood proteinase activity.\r"

Because nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NAD phosphate (NADP) are cofactors in the reactions of glycolysis and pentose phosphate shunt, we have examined NAD and NADP content in P. falciparum-infected RBCs. Although NADP content was not significantly altered, NAD content was increased approximately 10-fold in infected RBCs (66% parasitemia) compared with uninfected control RBCs. To determine the mechanism for the increase in NAD content, we examined the activity of several NAD biosynthetic enzymes. It is known that normal human RBCs make NAD exclusively from nicotinic acid and lack the capacity to make NAD from nicotinamide. We demonstrate that infected RBCs have readily detectable nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NPRT), the first enzyme in the NAD biosynthetic pathway that uses nicotinamide, and abundant nicotinamide deamidase, the enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, thereby indicating that infected RBCs can make NAD from nicotinamide. In addition, infected RBCs have a threefold increase in nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), the first enzyme in the NAD biosynthetic pathway that uses nicotinic acid. Thus, the increase in NAD content in P falciparum-infected RBCs appears to be mediated by increases in NAD synthesis from both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.\r"

  ".W": "The inheritance of idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) was investigated in 100 British families containing 107 index cases with generalized, multifocal or segmental dystonia, and 79 secondary cases. Fifty-eight index cases had affected relatives, usually in two or more generations. Nearly half of the secondary cases were asymptomatic. Paternal age was increased among the 49 single cases, parental consanguinity was not increased and there was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity. Eleven cases (10.3%) were Jewish, which exceeded the number expected, but they did not differ clinically or genetically from non-Jewish cases. The most likely explanation for the excess of Jewish cases is a founder effect in Eastern Europe. We conclude that, in the UK, approximately 85% of cases of ITD are due to an autosomal dominant gene with about 40% penetrance and highly variable expression, possibly reflecting environmental influences. Approximately 14% of these inherited cases may represent new mutations. The remaining 15% are probably nongenetic phenocopies, but are not clinically distinguishable. There was no evidence in this study for the existence of autosomal recessive or X-linked forms of ITD. The estimated recurrence risk for first degree relatives of familial cases is 21%; the risk is lower for single cases. Of affected individuals, 75% will have developed symptoms or signs of dystonia by the age of 30 yrs.\r"

We reviewed the evidence on the risk of HIV transmission to hospital workers and the effectiveness of the universal precautions. We also evaluated the costs of implementing the recommendations in a 450-bed acute care teaching hospital in Hamilton, Ont. On the basis of aggregated results from six prospective studies the risk of HIV seroconversion among hospital workers after a needlestick injury involving a patient known to have AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is 0.36% (upper 95% confidence limit 0.67%); the risk after skin and mucous membrane exposure to blood or other body fluids of AIDS patients is 0% (upper 95% confidence limit 0.38%). We estimated that 0.038 cases of HIV seroconversion would be prevented annually in the study hospital if the CDC recommendations were followed. The incremental cost of implementing the universal precautions was estimated to be about $315,000 per year, or over $8 million per case of HIV seroconversion prevented. If all HIV-infected workers were assumed to have AIDS within 10 years of infection the of the program would be about $565,000 per life-year saved. When less conservative, more probable assumptions were applied the best estimate of the implementation cost was $128,862,000 per case of HIV seroconversion prevented. The universal precautions implemented in the study hospital were not found to be efficacious or cost-effective. To minimize the already small risk of HIV transmission in hospitals the sources of risk of percutaneous injury should be better defined and the design of percutaneous lines, needles and surgical equipment as well as techniques improved. Preventive measures recommended on the basis of demonstrated efficacy and aimed at routes of exposure that represent true risk are needed.\r"

For invasive lesions, differences of opinion persist regarding the use of lumpectomy and irradiation versus modified radical mastectomy, but increasing data are helping to put the decisions on a sounder basis. Postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with node negative lesions is still being evaluated. Up to the present time, these changes have not had an impact on mortality, but insufficient time has passed to evaluate the results of treatment of these very early lesions.\r"

These therapies were restricted to this group of patients because the toxicities of adjuvant therapy were believed too great to justify its use in patients with a very good prognosis until its benefits were fully established. However, after it was demonstrated that adjuvant therapy can significantly prolong the disease-free survival of almost all groups of node-positive patients and the overall survival of some patient subsets, adjuvant therapy trials specifically designed for patients without histologically involved lymph nodes (\"node-negative\" patients) were initiated. Results from some of the largest of these second generation trials were recently published, and the early results from these studies have generated new questions. For example, will the mature results from these studies be nearly identical to the results seen in node-positive patients, or will node-negative patients derive greater benefits from adjuvant therapy? Is it possible that adjuvant therapy will \"cure\" node-negative patients but not node-positive patients? (Cure is defined here as an effect of therapy that returns a patient to the life expectancy she might have had if she had never been diagnosed with breast cancer). Is it possible that the added years of life from adjuvant therapy or that the number of node-negative patients who benefit are so small that these benefits will be outweighed by delayed toxicities that appear in patients who might have been cured even without adjuvant therapy? At present the available data to answer these questions definitely are either contradictory or nonexistent.\r"

In Stage II disease the results of clinical trials suggest that single agent chemotherapy has little if any role in adjuvant therapy. Polychemotherapy can improve survival in premenopausal women with a gain in outcome of about 26%. The duration of therapy appears optimal when given for 6 months. In postmenopausal estrogen receptor-negative women, chemotherapy also has a major role. Tamoxifen appears to offer approximately a 22% improvement in mortality for postmenopausal women. The longer duration of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy appears to enhance the effect. Premenopausal women may also benefit using tamoxifen but the gain is less clear. Adding tamoxifen to chemotherapy does not enhance the effect. Patients with more than four positive lymph nodes may require more intensive therapy to show a major benefit. Radiotherapy can be integrated along with chemotherapy as adjunctive therapy.\r"

Breast cancer recurrence may be reduced further by the administration of systemic chemotherapy. Mastectomy and breast conserving therapy give equal tumor control and survival, but the latter results in superior quality of life. To achieve the best tumor control with optimal cosmesis, certain generally accepted principles of surgical and radiotherapeutic management need to be followed. The surgeon must use a neat technique that avoids excessive removal of breast and axillary tissue, improper placement of the surgical scar in the breast, and the formation of seromas or hematomas, which result in breast or arm edema. The radiation oncologist must use supervoltage energy, fields that avoid excessive irradiation of the lungs and other sensitive structures, proper field matching, whole breast doses ranging from 4500 to 5000 cGy with fractions of 180 to 200 cGy per day, and brachytherapy or electron beam boost to achieve a total dose of approximately 6000 cGy in the tumor area. These principles should result in good to excellent cosmesis in more than 80% of treated breasts. Breast conserving management offers women an incentive to achieve early detection. Early detection is the most promising approach to reduce mortality from breast cancer.\r"

In particular, acute closed head injuries account for some 6000 potentially preventable deaths and literally millions of episodes of less severe head injuries each year. The long-term significance of chronic head injuries resulting from repetitive blows to the brain is only now being fully appreciated. Similarly subtle neuropsychological changes are being increasingly recognized resulting from milder head injuries. Although head injuries are almost inevitable and unavoidable sequelae of most contact and competitive sports, much can and should be done to reduce the serious acute and chronic neurologic complications inherent in these activities. Prevention of catastrophic sports injuries by careful preseason examination, education, training, and conditioning, and ongoing counseling of the athlete is of paramount importance. The use of carefully fitted protective headgear, and avoidance of maneuvers that may directly result in serious head injuries are also key. The immediate evaluation, evacuation, and triage of the injured athlete must take place carefully and expeditiously. Skillful, experienced, and compassionate definitive care must then ensue. In the long term, the complications and analysis of accurate statistical data on the magnitude of sports injuries in general, and nervous system involvement in particular, must be studied. Presently, only a few sports have accumulated such data, such as in the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. In the final analysis, it is the cooperative responsibility of the medical and athletic communities to strive to reduce these tragic injuries.\r"

There is no evidence that the occurrence of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia predisposes an individual to permanent neurologic injury. However, patients with this syndrome and associated with cervical spine instability or acute or chronic degenerative changes should be precluded from further participation in contact sports.

Shoulder girdle depression, which may be present as a result of postural abnormalities or trauma (athletic or otherwise) has become recognized as an important cause of thoracic outlet compression. Management of this syndrome is entirely dependent on making an accurate diagnosis and defining the cause of neurovascular compression. Although thoracic outlet syndrome occurs infrequently, if the physician fails to consider this diagnosis, patients may suffer unnecessary and prolonged disability that may not only preclude optimal participation in athletics, but also interfere with certain activities of daily living.\r"

The treatment of the athlete with medial elbow pain should not be isolated to the findings of ulnar neuritis especially when attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament is encountered. The prognosis of the athlete to return to their prior level of competition is related to their preoperative presentation. Patients with long-standing ulnar neuritis and severe lesions that include intrinsic muscle dysfunction and profound findings on EMG and nerve conduction studies have a less favorable outcome. The prognosis is also related to other associated conditions such as ulnar collateral ligament attenuation and degenerative arthritis. In athletes with symptoms primarily secondary to ulnar neuritis with minimal neurologic deficits and early treatment, the prognosis for return to competitive play is excellent.\r"

Traumatic pseudoaneurysms may arise from seemingly minor trauma and are treated surgically. The etiology of nonspecific claudication in the athletic population requires a careful history and physical examination and may require vascular studies in order to determine if the etiology is one of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, adventitial cystic disease of the popliteal artery, or adductor canal outlet syndrome. Buerger's disease may be seen more frequently as the use of smokeless tobacco increases in the athletic population and may be distinguished from these other claudication-causing entities by its distribution to the upper and lower extremities in a distal fashion. A sense of alertness to these vascular entities will add to the quality of care of athletes.\r"

A thorough knowledge of peripheral nerve anatomy is essential in establishing the diagnosis. Roentgenograms may reveal bony abnormalities that are the diagnosis. Roentgenograms may reveal bony abnormalities that are commonly contributory. Electrodiagnostic tests may be normal because these dynamic syndromes often resolve at rest. In most cases, correction of underlying etiologies combined with rest, NSAIDs, and occasionally injections will allow resolution of the syndrome. Recalcitrant cases may require surgical decompression, which frequently provides satisfactory results.\r"

We evaluated the long-term effect of captopril (75 to 150 mg per day) on thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in 12 normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis. Captopril significantly decreased the mean (+/- SD) number of segments with thallium 201 myocardial perfusion defects (6.5 +/- 1.9 at baseline and 4.4 +/- 2.7 after 1 year of treatment with captopril; p less than 0.02) and increased the mean global thallium score (9.6 +/- 1.7 at baseline and 11.4 +/- 2.1 after captopril; p less than 0.05). In a control group of eight normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis who did not receive captopril, no significant modification in thallium results occurred. Side effects with captopril included hypotension (six patients), taste disturbances (one patient), and skin rash (one patient). These side effects subsided when the dosage was reduced. These findings demonstrate that captopril improves thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in patients with systemic sclerosis and may therefore have a beneficial effect on scleroderma myocardial disease.\r"

Bivariate and linear discriminant analyses revealed that, above all, variables related to bacterial infections (sepsis and administration of antibiotic agents) and pancreatitis contributed to the discrimination, followed by bleeding, volume depletion, and chronic liver disease in the discriminant function. Bivariate analysis also yielded significant results for mechanical ventilation, CNS depression, and surgery. The importance of the nephrotoxic properties of aminoglycosides may be outweighed by their role as an indicator of severe infectious disease. The overall correct classification rate of the discriminant function was 78.5%, which reflects the importance of the predictor variables, but does not allow individual predictions.\r"

In six patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions, TEB cardiac output measurements were compared during zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) and during PEEP at 8 cm H2O with a low respiratory rate. The data revealed a good correlation during ZEEP (r = .93) and during PEEP (r = .91). There was no significant statistical difference when measuring cardiac output by TEB during ventilation with PEEP. During normal or decreased cardiac output, TEB overestimated cardiac output compared with TD, whereas TEB underestimated cardiac output compared with TD during increased cardiac output, especially during PEEP.\r"

In principle, invasive and on-line techniques offer more hope for future success in continuous bedside monitoring of all the key critical care analyses. However, success in these directions will come only when issues regarding sensor stability and sampling device/sensor biocompatibility are completely solved. Until then, it appears that the user-friendly point of care type stat analyzers that can provide accurate values for all the key analytes, used in conjunction with existing noninvasive trend monitors (eg, pulse oximetry), will offer the most attractive approach for the effective treatment of critically ill patients.\r"

All patients were in remission, which was documented by clinical, histologic, and endoscopic criteria. Five-aminosalicylic acid treatment was administered on an intermittent schedule, consisting of 4 gm daily for the first seven days of each month; sulfasalazine was given as continuous therapy (2 gm daily as oral tablets). The study period was 2 years. Overall, 9 relapses occurred in the 5-aminosalicylic acid group and 12 occurred in the sulfasalazine group. The actuarial relapse rate at 12 months was 20 percent in the 5-aminosalicylic acid group and 24 percent in the sulfasalazine group; at 24 months, these rates were 37 and 43 percent, respectively. The actuarial relapse curves of the two groups were very similar. The relapse severity was also similar between the two groups. These results show that the authors proposed schedule of maintenance treatment with high-dose 5-aminosalicylic acid enemas is effective in subjects with rectosigmoiditis. This form of intermittent therapy may therefore be proposed for maintaining remission in patients who are refractory to oral and/or rectal treatment with sulfasalazine and steroids or who are intolerant or allergic to sulfasalazine. Treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid enemas for seven days each month can also constitute an alternative for patients who favor the intermittent schedule over the classic continuous regimen of oral administrations.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic cor pulmonale is defined as right heart hypertrophy and/or chronic right heart failure. There are many etiologies, but the common cause is increased right heart work from pulmonary hypertension. Etiology can be conveniently discussed by assuming two prototypes, the asphyxial or hypoxic type and the vascular obliterative type. A common cause of the asphyxial type is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the obliterative type is represented by chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease or primary pulmonary hypertension. Pathology is discussed, emphasizing the cardiac manifestations of chronic cor pulmonale including data of specific cardiac chamber size. An overview of hemodynamics is given, and the use and limitation of electrocardiography and chest x-rays are discussed. The exciting potential use of echocardiography for the serial non-invasive measurement of anatomical and pathophysiological features is outlined, along with the value of a careful physical examination and the proper utilization of laboratory tests in the diagnosis of chronic cor pulmonale. In the patient with the asphyxial type, the treatment of pulmonary infectious exacerbations, the role of corticosteroids, digoxin, diuretics, phlebotomy, bronchodilators (theophylline, beta adrenergic agonists, and anticholinergics), and long-term oxygen therapy is noted. The controversy surrounding the use of vasodilators and calcium blockers in these patients is discussed. Treatment aspects of the vascular obliterative type, including the role of vasodilators, calcium blockers, prostacyclin, anticoagulants, and overall strategy are discussed. A brief note is mentioned of the promising role of surgical therapy in chronic thromboembolic disease causing chronic cor pulmonale.\r"

  ".W": "The screening examination of the heart and blood vessels require the use of the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray film. The relevant anatomy, pathology, and physiology responsible for the abnormalities found by using these methods of examination must be understood. The abnormalities that can be detected by the use of these methods of examination are discussed in this monograph. The techniques themselves are referred to as being low technology. The skill required in the use of these methods must be developed to its fullest. The data collected by using the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray film must be carefully analyzed in order for the examiner to diagnose the patient's cardiac problem. When possible, a complete cardiac diagnosis should be made according to guidelines formulated by the New York Heart Association. The four elements of a complete diagnosis are: Etiology, anatomy, physiology, and cardiac status and prognosis. In many cases, no additional data are needed and no additional data should be collected. When it is not possible to create a complete cardiac diagnosis from this information, the examiner must determine if it is wise and proper, given the patient's other health problems, to collect additional data that would permit a complete cardiac diagnosis. This effort hones the judgmental skill of the physician. When the cardiac diagnosis remains incomplete, or when a complete cardiac diagnosis is made but additional information is needed for follow-up purposes, carefully selected high technology should be used. With the unanswered questions in mind, the procedure used should be the one that answers the question with a predictive value that permits a defensible clinical decision. A complete medical problem list should be created for every patient. The cardiovascular problem must always be viewed in the context of other medical problems; there is no other way to make a sound judgment regarding the care of the patient with heart disease. When low technology, consisting of the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray film, is used poorly it is very likely that high technology will be used poorly. It is not possible to take a second step (high technology) without taking a well placed first step (low technology).\r"

  ".W": "To further define the relationship between plasma LH concentrations and progesterone secretion by the primate corpus luteum, we examined luteal function in rhesus monkeys in response to reduced LH concentrations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Five anovulatory rhesus monkeys received a pulsatile infusion of synthetic GnRH (6 micrograms/pulse; one pulse per h, iv) to restore menstrual cyclicity. During the early luteal phase (4-5 days after ovulation), the amount of GnRH administered per pulse was reduced to 1/250th or 1/750th of the standard GnRH infusion regimen. Plasma LH concentrations, determined by bioassay, were reduced by approximately 50% during cycles maintained by reduced GnRH concentrations compared with the standard GnRH dosage. Serum progesterone concentrations were maintained for 5-6 days after GnRH reduction and declined thereafter, and premature menstruations were observed in four of seven cycles maintained by the 1/250th GnRH reduction and four of six cycles maintained with the 1/750th GnRH reduction. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that luteal regression during the nonfertile menstrual cycles of primates is due primarily to an alteration in luteal cell responsiveness to LH, rather than a reduction in the gonadotropic drive to the corpus luteum per se. When plasma LH concentrations were reduced during the early luteal phase to values below those found during the onset of luteal regression in control cycles, luteal function was maintained for 5-6 days. However, as the luteal phase progressed, the reduced LH concentrations were unable to sustain progesterone secretion, and premature menses occurred in some, but not all, animals.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin-1 is a 21 amino acid peptide originally isolated from porcine aortic endothelium and has recently been localized within the central nervous system. We have administered endothelin-1 in a dynamic perfusion system in order to study its possible effects on the rat hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Tissue (hypothalami or quartered pituitaries) was placed into plastic chambers and was perfused with oxygenated Krebs-bicarbonate solution. After an interval to establish stable basal peptide release, endothelin-1 was administered at two doses (0.1 and 1 microM) and the release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, 7B2, and somatostatin was measured, the last being detectable only in hypothalamic perfusates. Both concentrations of endothelin-1 led to a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in the release of substance P from the hypothalamus and pituitary, but not of vasoactive intestinal peptide, 7B2, or somatostatin. Thus after the 0.1 microM and 1 microM endothelin-1 perfusion substance P release from the hypothalamus increased by 125 +/- 5% and 215 +/- 15% (mean +/- SEM) of basal and from the pituitary by 168 +/- 8% and 276 +/- 15% (mean +/- SEM). No change occurred in the output of ACTH or other pituitary hormones. The release of substance P from hypothalamus or pituitary after stimulation with endothelin-1 was not blocked when a calcium free medium was used. Endothelin-1 binding sites were identified on rat pituitary cell membranes. These findings suggest the possibility that endothelin may act as a paracrine substance, neurotransmitter, or neuromodulator in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.\r"

  ".U": "90228225\r", 
  ".W": "Isolated rat islets of Langerhans were incubated for 2 h in a myo-[2-3H]inositol-containing solution to label their phosphoinositides. Also included during this labeling period was forskolin (0.1-5 microM), a compound established to elevate islet cAMP levels. These islets were subsequently perifused, and their insulin secretory responses to 20 mM glucose or 1 microM of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were assessed. Determined in parallel with secretion were [3H] inositol efflux patterns and, at the termination of the perifusion, labeled inositol phosphate accumulation. The following major observations were made. 1) Forskolin had no deleterious effect on the total amount of [3H]inositol incorporated by the islets during the labeling period. 2) However, labeling in forskolin resulted in subsequent dose-dependent decreases in 20 mM glucose-induced insulin secretion, [3H]inositol efflux and inositol phosphate accumulation. 3) Inclusion of the diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase inhibitor monooleoylglycerol (50 microM) restored to a significant degree glucose-induced release from forskolin-desensitized islets. 4) Pretreatment with 5 microM forskolin had no deleterious effect on TPA-induced insulin release. 5) Prior exposure to forskolin also impaired phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to cholecystokinin stimulation. 6) Similar to forskolin, labeling in isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mM) reduced in a parallel fashion islet [3H]inositol efflux and insulin secretion in response to 20 mM glucose stimulation. These findings demonstrate that prior chronic elevation of islet cAMP levels suppresses the activation of phospholipase-C in response to subsequent stimulation. Defective insulin secretory responsiveness of these islets appears to be the result of impaired generation of phosphoinositide-derived second messenger molecules, particularly DAG. By substituting for DAG, however, TPA circumvents this biochemical lesion and evokes a normal insulin secretory response from forskolin-pretreated islets.\r"

These clones showed differences of hormone secretion, morphology, and response to estrogen. One clone tentatively designated MtT/E, consisted of spindle-shaped epithelial cells and showed the strongest adhesion to the culture dish, but did not secrete any pituitary hormone. The second cell line, designated MtT/S, secreted only GH, showed very weak contact with the culture dish, and proliferated almost anchorage independently. the MtT/S cells were mainly spherical and formed floating or weakly adherent clusters. Some of them had very long dendrite- or neurite-like cell processes. Electron microscopic examination of the MtT/S cells showed a normal somatotrope-like appearance, i.e. the presence in the cytoplasm of many GH-containing secretory granules, well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, these cells secreted GH in response to stimulation with GRF. The third cell line with an ovoid cell appearance tentatively designated MtT/SM, secreted both PRL and GH, and showed anchorage-dependent proliferation. The fourth cell line designated MtT/Se secreted only a small amount of GH. Among these newly established cell lines, MtT/Se was the smallest in size and showed estrogen-dependent proliferation. The many small secretory-like granules present in the cytoplasm of MtT/Se cells showed no immunocytochemically positive reaction for anterior pituitary hormone. MtT/S and MtT/SM cell lines were also sensitive to estrogen.\r"

  ".U": "90228232\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed polyclonal antibodies to two synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino-(N-)terminal or carboxyl-(C-)terminal segments of the human androgen receptor (hAR) protein, as deduced from the nucleic acid sequence of the androgen receptor cDNA. Immunoreactive antisera were identified by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and purified by peptide affinity chromatography. Specific immunoreactivity with the hAR was confirmed by immunoblotting, using both a fusion protein produced in E. coli that contains the C-terminal 880-amino acid sequence of hAR and the full-length receptor protein produced in COS cells after transfection with a plasmid containing the entire hAR-coding region. Immunohistological evaluation of rat and human prostatic tissue using anti-C-terminal or anti-N-terminal antibodies demonstrated similar patterns of specific staining of the nuclei of epithelial and stromal cells. Castration resulted in a decrease in the amount of nuclear AR detected in the rat prostate after a short time of exposure to anti-C-terminal antibodies (less than 4 h), but did not alter the level of specific staining obtained with anti-N-terminal antibodies. This decrease in nuclear staining using anti-C-terminal antibodies could be reversed by treating castrated animals with dihydrotestosterone. When longer times of exposure to the primary antibodies were used, high levels of nuclear staining were obtained with both types of antibodies in prostate specimens from castrate as well as as intact rats. This immunohistochemical staining pattern contrasts with receptor measurements in rat prostate homogenates that indicate the partition of AR binding into the low salt (cytosolic) fraction in the castrate animal and into the high salt (nuclear) fraction in the intact animal. Our results suggest that the AR is predominantly a nuclear protein even in the absence of ligand and that dihydrotestosterone serves to tighten its association with the nucleus. These data also suggest that the immunoreactivity of anti-C-terminal antibodies is influenced by the presence of dihydrotestosterone, presumably via an alteration in the physical state of the receptor protein.\r"

In contrast, the ob/ob mouse islets at 5.5 mM glucose dephosphorylated 18% of the glucose phosphorylated and 30% at 16.7 mM. Thus, the islets of hyperglycemic mice demonstrate increased glucose cycling as compared to the islets of normoglycemic lean mice.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the presence of three specific types of glucose transporters (GT) within the rabbit central nervous system during various developmental stages. Employing the Hep G2/brain-type insulin-insensitive and the insulin-responsive (IRGT; adipocyte/skeletal muscle type) GT antibody and cDNA, we studied protein and mRNA within the whole brain (25-, 27-, and 30-day-old fetus; 1-, 5-, 10-day-old neonate; and adult), using cultured neuronal and glial cells, by Western and Northern blot analysis. Similarly, using the insulin-insensitive human fetal skeletal muscle-type (GLUT-3) GT cDNA, we characterized this mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Additional confirmation of cell specificity was sought by performing immunohistochemical staining on the neuronal and glial cells to detect the specific type of GT protein. We observed a developmental regulation of brain-type GT within the whole brain, the peak abundance of protein and mRNA occurring in the adult, followed next by the fetus. No IRGT was detected within the whole brain at any stage of development. Contrary to the brain-type GT mRNA, GLUT-3 mRNA was found to be most abundant in the 10-day-old neonate and adult, followed next by the early neonate, with little in the fetus. Within isolated brain cell cultures, the mRNAs for the brain- and GLUT-3-types of GTs were abundantly present within glial cells, with considerably lesser amounts noted within the neurons. IRGT, on the other hand, revealed rather weak mRNA bands in both glial and neuronal cells. Western blotting revealed a brain type of GT protein within the glial cells alone; the neuronal cells for the most part were devoid of both the brain-type and the IRGT proteins. Further immunohistochemical staining confirmed the definite presence of the brain-type GT within the glial cells, with slight immunoreactivity observed within the neurons. Additionally, no significant IRGT immunoreactivity was observed within either cell type. We did not study the GLUT-3 type of immunoreactivity within neurons and glia. We conclude that both the Hep G2/brain and the GLUT-3 types, and not the IRGT, are developmentally regulated within the whole brain. Further, the Hep G2/brain and the GLUT-3 types of GTs are distinctly present within glial cells, with none to minute amounts present within the neurons. No IRGT protein is observed within the whole brain and the two cell types. These results suggest a differential expression of specific GT types within the neuronal and glial components of the brain.\r"

Two antibody preparations, 56-125 and 56-126, used to detect 11 beta-dehydrogenase antigen in Western blots, generated different staining patterns for kidney, liver, brain, and heart. Using the two antibodies together, the total number of antibody-reacting components in kidney was three, and that in liver was two. Based on rates of digestion with proteases, the two prominent immunoreactive proteins in kidney appeared to be structurally or conformationally different. A prominent immunostaining component was present in stomach. Tissues that showed immunochemical evidence of 11 beta-dehydrogenase antigen showed corresponding levels of 11 beta-dehydrogenase activity. Most active were liver, testis, kidney, and lung. Lower levels of activity were found in prostate and epididymis, brain, and reproductive tract. We conclude that 11 beta-dehydrogenase is widely distributed in rat organs and is present at low levels with significant exceptions. The data indicate that 11 beta-dehydrogenase may occur in several enzyme forms, and that the distribution of these forms is to some extent tissue specific.\r"

  ".U": "90228247\r", 
  ".W": "An interaction between the immune and endocrine systems has been long known. This association is further strengthened by the finding that splenic lymphocytes have the capacity to produce molecules similar to if not the same as classical hormones, including several members of the opiate family, PRL, GH, and neuropeptide Y. Because of such findings and because of information from other laboratories suggesting that LHRH might have direct effects upon the immune system, we hypothesized that immune cells themselves might contain LHRH. Lymphocytes were purified from spleens of intact adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and the cells were lysed with sodium hydroxide. The concentration of immunoreactive LHRH was 403 +/- 184 pg/20 X 10(6) lymphocytes. Increasing amounts of lymphocyte lysate displaced [125-I]LHRH from LHRH antibody in a manner parallel to that produced by synthetic hypothalamic LHRH, suggesting immunologic similarity between lymphocyte and hypothalamic LHRH. Lymphocyte LHRH-like immunoactivity coeluted from Nova-Pak C18 columns with synthetic hypothalamic LHRH. When lymphocyte lysates were applied to rat anterior pituitary cells in monolayer culture, significant stimulation of LHRH secretion was seen, from 2,144 +/- 54 pg LH/ml.4 h to 15,364 +/- 587 pg LH/ml.4 h (P less than 0.001), a finding verified in five additional experiments. In other studies, this LH response evoked by lymphocyte lysates was found to be dose dependent and could be significantly inhibited by an LHRH-antagonist. Furthermore, when lymphocyte lysate and identically treated synthetic LHRH were HPLC fractionated, there was coelution of lysate and hypothalamic LHRH bioactivity. The lysate itself contained no substantial LH immunoreactivity. Thus, lymphocytes from spleens of adult male rats contain an immunoactive and bioactive LHRH, a finding further strengthening an association between the endocrine and immune systems.\r"

  ".U": "90228250\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulates the release of LH was analyzed in cultured female rat pituitary cells. In 3-h incubations, GABA (1-100 microM) caused a dose-dependent increase in LH release, with the maximal response about 16% of that evoked by 10 nM GnRH. GABA action was independent of the GnRH receptor, since 1 microM GnRH antagonist [( N-acetyl-D-p-Cl-Phe1,2,D-Trp3,D-Lys6,D-Ala10] GnRH), which completely inhibits GnRH action, did not affect the response to GABA. In studies on the effects of GABA receptor agonists and antagonists, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydoisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3(2H)-one (THIP) and muscimol (GABAA agonists) gave similar response patterns, with the same maximal stimulation as GABA but much higher potencies. In contrast, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen did not stimulate LH release. The GABAA receptor antagonist SR95531 caused dose-dependent inhibition of the LH-releasing effects of GABA and muscimol (10 microM), with complete blockade at 10 microM SR95531. T-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate, an inhibitor of the GABAA receptor-associated chloride channel, also dose-dependently reduced the releasing effect of 100 microM GABA. These results indicate that GABA action is mediated by the chloride channel-associated GABAA receptor. However, the other GABAA receptor antagonists, including bicuculline, picrotoxin, and strychnine, did not attenuate the LH-releasing effect of 100 microM GABA in concentrations up to 100 microM, suggesting that GABA action is mediated by nonclassical GABAA receptors. Incubation in the presence of nifedipine (1 microM) or in calcium-free medium inhibited the LH-releasing action of GABA, indicating that calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) is required for GABA-induced LH release. Such entry of Ca2+ would result from activation of VSCC by depolarization due to the increased Cl- conductance caused by GABAA receptor activation. In cell perfusion studies, the actions of GABA and muscimol were attenuated or abolished after repetitive stimulation, consistent with desensitization of the GABA receptors. These findings have demonstrated that the stimulation of LH release by GABA is independent of GnRH action, occurs via binding to nonclassical GABAA receptors, which rapidly desensitize, and is mediated by the activation of VSCC.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) bioactivity is reduced in animals and patients with diabetes mellitus. We sought to determine whether the availability and levels of specific IGF binding proteins (BPs) are altered in animals with experimental diabetes, and might contribute to changes in circulating IGF bioactivity in experimental diabetes. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered streptozotocin or citrate buffer iv, and then killed either 3 days later, or else after 4-day insulin treatment (7.5 U/kg human NPH twice daily), or 2 days after insulin was discontinued. Serum [125I]IGF-I binding activity was markedly increased in diabetic animals compared to controls when analyzed by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography, dot blot, and affinity labeling techniques, due to increased binding to low mol wt BPs (81 +/- 4% of ligand eluting with low mol wt BPs in diabetic serum vs. 22 +/- 3% in control, P less than 0.001). In contrast, activated charcoal removed ligand from these BPs and underestimated the availability of BPs in diabetes. Serum binding activity fell toward control levels during insulin therapy, then rose again after insulin was withdrawn, corresponding to changes in metabolic status. To distinguish changes in specific BPs, serum proteins were separated by 13% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to nitrocellulose. Ligand blotting with [125I]IGF-I demonstrated that serum levels of a 32 K mol wt IGF BP are markedly increased in diabetic rats and decline during insulin therapy. Levels of this 32 K IGF BP rose again after insulin was discontinued, demonstrating regulation in accordance with changes in insulin and metabolic status. Western analysis and affinity labeling with immunoprecipitation revealed that this 32 K protein is distinct from the 34 K fetal rat BP, and is immunologically related to the type 1 human IGF BP. We conclude that circulating [125I]IGF-I binding activity is markedly increased in animals with acute streptozotocin-induced diabetes, due to changes in low mol wt proteins, including a 32 K type 1 IGF BP that is regulated by changes in insulin and/or metabolic status. Regulation of low mol wt IGF BPs by insulin, and perhaps other factors, may play an important role in the modulation of tissue growth factor bioactivity in metabolic disease.\r"

Win 49,596 was shown to bind to the androgen receptor from normal canine prostate with a Ki of 2.2 microM. After 16 weeks of treatment, prostate size, as estimated by transrectal ultrasonography, was unchanged in intact controls and was 26% of the initial size in castrate controls. Oral doses of Win 49,596 from 0.625-40 mg/kg.day for 16 weeks caused dose-dependent prostatic regression and a dose-related increase in both the incidence and severity of glandular atrophy of the prostate. Prostatic secretory function was also inhibited by Win 49,596 treatment. The effects of Win 49,596 at 40 mg/kg.day on prostatic weight, total DNA, histomorphology, and secretory function were similar to those of castration, while the effects of Win 49,596 at 10 mg/kg.day were similar to those of ICI 176,334 at 0.25 mg/kg.day and MK-906 at 1.0 mg/kg.day. No effects on testicular weight, daily sperm production, or spermatogenesis were observed; however, mild Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed in two dogs treated with 40 mg/kg.day Win 49,596. In addition, at 10 and 40 mg/kg.day Win 49,596, moderate but variable increases in serum testosterone levels were observed. In summary, Win 49,596 caused regression of the hypertrophic canine prostate without effects on spermatogenesis and/or sexual function, supporting its possible use in the treatment of human benign prostatic hypertrophy/hyperplasia.\r"

Monospecific polyclonal antisera against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and amylase were applied to serial sections in colocalization studies to identify the respective endocrine and exocrine cells. Glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity was exclusively present in nuclei and cytoplasm of the beta-cells of pancreatic islets. Western blots using the glucocorticoid receptor antibody resulted in identical 94K immunoreactive proteins in both liver and pancreas. After adrenalectomy, the glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity of beta-cells decreased significantly. A computer-assisted method of semiquantitative evaluation of the glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity demonstrated a significant decrease in the staining intensity of the beta-cells by 23.5% and in that of insulin antibodies by 10.4%, while amylase immunoreactivity was only slightly decreased. Serum levels of corticosterone determined by RIA decreased from 225 micrograms/ml in sham-operated animals to 55 micrograms/ml in animals 14 days after adrenalectomy, while the tissue content of amylase decreased by 45%. The immunohistochemical findings give circumstantial evidence of the presence of glucocorticoid receptor in beta-cells. We interpret our data as indicating an indirect effect of glucocorticoids on amylase synthesis via a glucocorticoid-insulin-exocrine cell pathway.\r"

  ".U": "90228271\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin acts directly as a mitogen on isolated embryonic tissues but has been shown to be inactive at physiological concentrations on several fetal cell types. Since insulin availability is obligatory for optimal fetal growth, we have investigated its mitogenic actions on chondrocytes isolated from the epiphyseal growth plates of fetal lambs. Chondrocytes were isolated from the proximal tibial growth plate of lamb fetuses between 40 and 130 days gestation using collagenase and were cultured in monolayer before use between passages 2 and 6. The synthesis of DNA was assessed from the incorporation of [3H]thymidine after incubation in medium supplemented with glucose (0.7 mM-25 mM) with or without insulin (0.08 nM-167 nM). Increase in cell number was assessed after incubation with test medium for up to 8 days. Insulin substantially increased both DNA synthesis, and cell number, compared to control incubations with a biphasic dose response; an initial 3- to 5-fold increase in DNA synthesis occurring at approximately 1 nM insulin with a second response seen at approximately 50 nM. Within the physiological range of concentrations insulin was only 50% as active as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), but was 15 times more active than IGF II. Similar effects of insulin were observed throughout the fetal age range, although the DNA synthetic rate in basal medium declined with both fetal age and cell passage number. The mitogenic actions of insulin were glucose-dependent and were maximal in the presence of 2.7 mM glucose. Insulin did not cause any change in chondrocyte cell cycle duration. Chondrocytes released immunoreactive IGF II but no detectable IGF I. While exposure to insulin concentrations of approximately 50 nM or greater resulted in a statistically significant increase in IGF II release from chondrocytes, no change in IGF II release was seen in response to physiological insulin concentrations. However, exposure of cells to a blocking monoclonal antibody against human IGF I, McAb SM 1.2, which also negates the mitogenic actions of IGF II, consistently reduced insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis suggesting that IGF II presence may be necessary for optimal insulin action. Combination experiments using maximal concentrations of IGF I (13.3 nM) and increasing amounts of insulin (0.16 nM-1.67 nM) showed additive effects on DNA synthesis, suggesting that each hormone was acting through distinct receptor populations. We conclude that insulin, at physiological concentrations, may exert direct growth-promoting actions at the epiphyseal growth plates of the fetal lamb throughout gestation.\r"

  ".U": "90228277\r", 
  ".W": "Growth retardation induced by dietary restriction in the lamb results in a low frequency of episodic LH secretion and, thus, delayed puberty. Such lambs respond normally to physiological doses of GnRH, indicating that the pituitary gland can function adequately during diet-induced hypogonadotropism. The current studies investigated central mechanisms underlying diet-induced hypogonadotropism. The first aim was to determine whether the hypothalamic GnRH secretory system is capable of normal function. The initial approach was to compare hypothalamic GnRH content between lambs on a restricted diet with low LH pulse frequency (less than 1 pulse/4 h; n = 5) and lambs on an ad libitum diet with high LH pulse frequency (4.5 +/- 0.4 pulses/4 h; n = 5). RIA of extracts of preoptic area and mediobasal hypothalamus/median eminence tissue blocks revealed no differences in GnRH content between lambs on a restricted diet and those on an ad libitum diet. The second approach was to determine if LH secretion could be induced by chemical stimulation of neuronal function with N-methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMA), an excitatory amino acid agonist. Initially, a single iv bolus of NMA was given to hypogonadotropic lambs on a restricted diet. There was a dose-dependent immediate rise in serum LH concentrations. All lambs responded to the highest dose (5.0 mg/kg BW; n = 6), and four of five lambs responded to the intermediate dose (1.0 mg/kg). No lambs responded to the lowest dose (0.2 ng/kg), despite a normal response to GnRH (2.5 ng/kg BW, iv). In a second experiment, hypogonadotropic lambs on a restricted diet were treated with repeated injections of NMA (5 mg/kg BW, iv) at either hourly intervals (n = 6) or every 3 h (n = 6). Each NMA injection induced a LH pulse in both treatment regimens over the entire 7-h experimental period. Thus, the nutritionally growth-limited lamb is capable of sustained production of LH pulses, which, we presume, reflect GnRH secretion. The second aim was to test the hypothesis that endogenous opioid mechanisms inhibit LH secretion during nutritionally induced hypogonadotropism, because opioid pathways are a poor inhibitory regulator of LH secretion in the normally developing sheep, even in the absence of ovarian steroids. We were unable to detect any effects of the opiate antagonist naloxone on LH secretion in the nutritionally growth-limited lamb. We conclude that central mechanisms controlling the release, rather than synthesis, of GnRH are limiting LH secretion when sexual maturation is delayed by growth retardation. Moreover, opioid inhibition is not the primary reason for hypogonadotropism during dietary restriction.\r"

Subsequent treatment of diabetic animals with vanadate resulted in renewed expression of the transporter to 87% of control levels. Northern blot analysis of total skeletal muscle RNA from diabetic animals revealed a 55% decline in the steady state level of muscle glucose transporter mRNA, while vanadate treatment led to a 187% increase in transporter mRNA over normal levels. These results support the conclusion that vanadate acts to relieve diabetic hyperglycemia by inducing expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter at the pretranslational level.\r"

After 2 weeks, approximately 30% of the colonies that formed were composed of cells with a unique polygonal morphology. One hundred percent of the polygonal cells in these colonies crossreacted with the monoclonal antibody 23c6, which preferentially recognizes osteoclasts. Homogenous populations of these polygonal cells formed multinucleated cells (MNC) in suspension culture, 100% of which cross-reacted with the 23c6 monoclonal antibody, and greater than 90% of the MNC contracted in response to calcitonin. Approximately 20% of these MNC formed resorption lacunae on calcified matrices. These results suggest that 1) early osteoclast precursors are derived from CFU-GM, the committed granulocyte-macrophage progenitor; 2) committed mononuclear osteoclast precursors have a distinct polygonal morphology and cross-react with monoclonal antibodies that recognize mature osteoclasts; and 3) these mononuclear precursors are capable of forming multinucleated cells which fulfill the functional criteria for osteoclasts.\r"

We have used the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line to study the biosynthesis and secretion of this hormone. Using immunofluorescence, we have determined that less than 5% of cells expressed detectable hCG at a given time, and about 30% of hCG-producing cells were morphologically differentiated. Treatment of the cells with 8-bromoadenosine produced a 2- to 5-fold increase in hCG synthesis and secretion and increased the number of cells expressing hCG by 4- to 6-fold, without altering the percentage of morphologically differentiated cells expressing hCG. The effect on hCG biosynthesis was dose dependent and was induced maximally with a 24-h exposure to 8-bromoadenosine. However, exposure of JAR cells to 8-bromoadenosine for 2 to 6 h was sufficient to initiate a response. Treatment of JAR cells with the adenosine A2-receptor agonist N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine did not induce hCG biosynthesis. The effect of 8-bromoadenosine on hCG synthesis did, however, parallel the dose-effect curve for inhibition of thymidine incorporation and for decreased cell proliferation. We conclude that induction of hCG biosynthesis by 8-bromoadenosine occurs by inhibiting trophoblast cell proliferation, rather than by an adenosine receptor-mediated event. The observed increase in hCG production may be due to induction of an intermediate differentiated cell type or an increase in the number of cells in an hCG-producing cell cycle phase.\r"

We have isolated rat ovarian follistatin cDNA clones and used these to investigate the possibility that decidual tissue expresses the follistatin gene. We found that the follistatin gene is highly expressed during early pregnancy in tissue derived from the site of blastocyst implantation. Follistatin mRNA was observed in tissue obtained from the implantation site at days 6, 8 and 10 of gestation, but was not found in the placenta at later stages of gestation. This same pattern of follistatin expression was observed in pseudopregnant animals in which decidualization had been artificially induced, indicating that decidual tissue is the primary source of follistatin mRNA. In situ hybridization was used to examine follistatin gene expression in decidua in greater detail. The mRNA is preferentially found in antimesometrial tissue, and is strictly confined to the endometrial-derived decidual cells. These results suggest that follistatin might function as an important endocrine hormone during implantation of the fetus, perhaps by acting to appropriately modulate maternal FSH secretion during early pregnancy.\r"

EUS was inferior to endoscopy in detecting and grading esophageal varices (p less than 0.0005), but EUS was superior in the detection of varices in the fundus of the stomach (p less than 0.0005). Detection of periesophageal veins by EUS increased with increasing diameter of esophageal varices at endoscopy (57% in grade 1, 89% in grade 2, and 100% in grade 3), and there was a direct correlation between endoscopic grade and the diameter of the periesophageal collateral veins at EUS. The diameter of the azygous vein by EUS at its distal and proximal margins was significantly greater in patients with PH (p less than 0.001); the EUS diameter of the azygous vein was significantly larger with variceal grade 2 compared with grade 1 (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.01, respectively). In portal hypertensive gastropathy, endoscopic and EUS detection were coincident. No correlation was found between the presence of portal hypertensive gastropathy, endoscopic grade of esophageal varices, and detection of gastric varices at EUS.\r"

Recently, an ultrasound colonoscope has been developed which allows for visual examination, biopsy, and endosonography throughout the colon. Experience with this technique is limited and its role in the evaluation of colonic disease has not yet been determined. Further comparative trials are needed to more fully define the role of endosonography in the diagnosis of colorectal disease.\r"

Rotational mechanical sector scanning probes as well as phased array probes are also being developed. Ultrasound probes are best used for high resolution imaging of focal endoscopically visible lesions. Endoscopic visualization enables direction of the probe to the lesion of interest. Unlike dedicated ultrasound endoscopes, ultrasound probes do not screen large areas of tissue and do not have deep penetration. Ongoing research will help define the indications for use of these probes and should lead to further refinements in their design.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the tissue distribution, purification and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the bile canalicular cell surface molecule dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Immunoperoxidase staining of cryostat sections of rat liver with a monoclonal antibody, Medical Research Council OX-61, indicated specific binding to hepatocyte bile canalicular domains and brush borders of bile ducts. Additional staining was seen in other epithelial brush borders (small intestine, kidney, colon, pancreatic duct); acinar structures in salivary glands; endothelial structures and T cell areas in thymus, spleen and lymph node. The tissue distribution suggested that monoclonal antibody OX-61 binds to the ectoenzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV. This was confirmed by depletion of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity from tissue homogenates by monoclonal antibody OX-61 coupled to Sepharose. The molecule recognized by OX-61 was then purified from liver and kidney by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The molecule had a molecular weight of 110 kD under reducing conditions. The purified molecule was subsequently analyzed for amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Thirty-one N-terminal amino acids were sequenced and indicated identity with part of the predicted N-terminus of the previously cloned bile canalicular molecule GP110. On review, other similarities between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and GP110 were detected: molecular weight, deglycosylated form and metabolic half-life. Finally, the recent cloning of dipeptidyl peptidase IV permitted a comparison between the molecule recognized by monoclonal antibody OX-61, GP110 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV. It is concluded that these three molecules are almost certainly identical.\r"

However, scaling up of production of such conjugates may lead to a high degree of variation in molar ratios of drug to antibody in different batches. In this study, an alternative link between drug and antibody was evaluated. A conjugate between adriamycin and murine IgGI monoclonal antibodies to human alpha-fetoprotein was prepared using a polyglutamic-acid bridge. The simple and reproducible method of linking adriamycin to a specific site on the antibody enabled the binding of the drug to alpha-fetoprotein with a high yield (63% to 68%); the molar ratio of drug/antibody was in the range of 110:1 to 120:1. The conjugate retained its capacity to bind to purified alpha-fetoprotein. Incorporation of [3H]-thymidine or [3H]-leucine into hepatoma cells, which express alpha-fetoprotein, was inhibited by the conjugate, compared with unconjugated antibody. Furthermore, 90% of this pharmacological activity was preserved, compared with free adriamycin. In vitro, the inhibitory activity of the polyglutamic acid conjugate was higher than that of a conjugate in which dextran was used as the linker between drug and antibody. In vivo, both conjugates were equally effective in suppression of hepatoma growth transplanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. However, this effect lasted only during the treatment period of 2 to 3 wk. Six days after discontinuation of therapy, reacceleration of tumor growth was observed regardless of the conjugate used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocytes isolated from livers of Fischer 344 rats and transplanted into the spleens of rats from the same strain survived for at least 15 mo in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs. Hepatocytes attached themselves only in the red pulp of the spleen, most commonly in clumps without a discernible structure. Throughout the 15-mo period, intrasplenically transplanted hepatocytes expressed cytochrome P-450b, P-450e and albumin messenger RNAs, whereas alpha-fetoprotein messenger RNA was not expressed. In addition, the relative expression of albumin and P-450 genes was similar to that in liver. For example, albumin messenger RNA was expressed to higher levels than P-450b or e messenger RNAs. Northern blots hybridized with oligonucleotides specific for P-450b or P-450e showed that, as in liver, both P-450b and P-450e genes were induced in response to phenobarbital. Quantitative slot-blot hybridizations performed at 15 days and 1, 6, and 15 mo after hepatocyte transplantation revealed that cytochrome P-450b and P-450e messenger RNAs were induced about 20- to 30-fold by a single dose of phenobarbital. This level of induction was also similar to that observed in liver. Hence, intrasplenically transplanted hepatocytes represent a unique system in which hepatocytes, cultured in an extrahepatic in vivo environment, maintain for at least 15 mo a pattern of expression for these four liver genes similar to that in the adult liver. Moreover, these studies suggest that neither the organization of liver into acini nor a specific zonal sinusoidal microenvironment is necessary for adult hepatocytes to respond to phenobarbital with induction of P-450b and P-450e genes.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to analyze monokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes from these patients to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, and interleukin 6 was investigated. Spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 and interleukin 1 beta was similar in cirrhotic and healthy subjects, but serum levels of interleukin 6 (less than 2 U/ml vs. 9.5 +/- 3 U/ml) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (3.1 +/- 1.2 pg/ml vs. 12.0 +/- 1.2 pg/ml) were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified monocytes from patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, stimulated in vitro with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, displayed a marked increase of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6 secretions compared with healthy controls. A striking feature of this overproduction was its reversibility as assessed by allowing cells to rest in vitro without lipopolysaccharide for 1 to 7 days before stimulation. In such conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 secretions declined to levels present in healthy subjects in whom production remained stable, whereas interleukin 1 beta secretion markedly decreased in both groups to the point where no difference could be seen. This reversible oversecretion of cytokines after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, along with the lack of abnormality of spontaneous cytokine secretion, suggests that monocytes in these patients may have undergone an in vivo activation process analogous to a priming phenomenon. The in vitro activation with lipopolysaccharide may represent the correlate of in vivo endotoxemia observed during acute events such as sepsis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (6 to 8 wk duration), treated or untreated with insulin, were studied with two aims: (a) to ascertain whether protracted diabetes in the rat is associated with changes in circulating plasma protein levels analogous to those reported in human diabetic patients with clinical evidence of complications; (b) to evaluate the effects of experimental diabetes on the net cumulative biosynthesis of 10 specific plasma proteins by the isolated liver, perfused for 24 hr. Samples of liver donor plasma and samples of perfusate were analyzed by single radial immunodiffusion or by rocket immunoelectrophoresis for albumin, alpha 1-macroglobulin and the acute phase glycoproteins: fibrinogen, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Darcy), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Kawasaki), haptoglobin, alpha 2-(acute phase) globulin, hemopexin, C3-complement and ceruloplasmin. Diabetes (6 to 8 wk), untreated with insulin, resulted in significantly increased liver donor plasma levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Darcy) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Kawasaki); plasma levels of hemopexin and of C3 decreased to 75% and 30% of normal, respectively. Insulin treatment of diabetic liver donors for 6 to 8 wk prevented the increase in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Darcy) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Kawasaki) and minimized the decrease in C3 to 75% of normal. Perfused livers from untreated diabetic rats (6 to 8 wk) showed slightly decreased cumulative synthesis and secretion of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Darcy); however, synthesis of albumin was reduced to 35% of normal and that of eight glycoproteins ranged from 25% of normal (fibrinogen) to 12% of normal (C3). The striking in vitro induction of increased synthesis of acute-phase proteins by cortisol plus insulin in the isolated perfused normal liver was in contrast to the severely attenuated induction in perfused livers of untreated diabetic rats, which ranges from 50% of normal for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Darcy) to 5% of normal (C3). Severely negative perfusate nitrogen balance and impaired glucose utilization by perfused untreated diabetic livers contrasted with positive nitrogen balance and good glucose utilization of normal livers in response to insulin plus cortisol. The plasma protein synthetic capacity and the in vitro response to insulin plus cortisol of perfused livers from insulin-treated diabetic rats were normal for seven of the proteins but moderately decreased for albumin, haptoglobin and C3.\r"

There were 224 patients (29%) with a non-Q wave infarction, 326 (42%) with an inferoposterior Q wave infarction and 227 (29%) with an anterior Q wave infarction. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower in patients with an anterior Q wave infarction than in the other two groups (anterior Q wave 0.39; inferior Q wave 0.52; non-Q wave 0.53). Nevertheless, the total cardiac mortality rate during the follow-up period (average 25 months per patient) was only marginally higher (p = 0.42) in the anterior Q wave group (8.4%) than in the other two groups (inferoposterior Q wave 7.1%; non-Q wave 6.3%). The total first recurrent cardiac event was somewhat higher (p = 0.08) in the anterior Q wave group (18.1%) than in the other two groups (inferoposterior Q wave 11.7%; non-Q wave 15.6%). Survivorship analyses extending over 3 years revealed that electrocardiographic classification of the type of first infarction and Q wave location did not make significant independent contributions to the risk of postinfarction cardiac death or first recurrent cardiac event, either before or after adjustment for baseline clinical variables.\r"

Seventy-four patients with a mean age of 53 years had 75 valvuloplasty procedures performed over a 2.5 year period. Eighty-nine percent of the attempted procedures were completed and resulted in an increase in mean mitral valve area from 1.0 +/- 0.04 to 2.0 +/- 0.1 cm2 (p less than 0.0001); the valve area increased greater than or equal to 50% of the baseline valve area in 73% of the patients. Major complications included procedure-related death (2.7%), cardiac tamponade (6.7%), systemic embolism (2.7%) and emergency surgery (6.7%). At a mean follow-up period of 14.6 months, the condition of the majority of patients had improved, and 89% of 55 patients treated only with valvuloplasty were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. Thus, hemodynamic and clinical improvement can be obtained in the majority of patients with mitral stenosis treated with balloon valvuloplasty in multiple centers. However, suboptimal results and major complications occurred in a significant number of patients and may limit this procedure to use by experienced operators in hospitals with facilities for cardiac surgery.\r"

In patients without embolism before echocardiography, there was a trend toward a greater incidence of subsequent embolism in those with vegetations greater than 10 mm in size (26% [8 of 31] compared with 11% [2 of 18] with vegetations less than or equal to 10 mm) (p = 0.19). By multivariate analysis, risk factors for in-hospital death (n = 7) were an infected prosthetic valve (p less than 0.007), systemic embolism (p less than 0.02) and infection with Staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study design enabled the prospective evaluation of the relation of platelet activation, as measured by plasma beta-thromboglobulin concentration, to subsequent coronary vein graft occlusion. Serial beta-thromboglobulin levels were measured in 105 patients randomized to receive aspirin (324 mg/day) or placebo beginning within 1 h after surgery. Graft patency was assessed angiographically at 1 week and 1 year after surgery. Of 49 patients receiving placebo, 17 (34.7%) had one or more graft occlusions, 6 early, 10 late and 1 with both early and late occlusion. Of 56 patients receiving aspirin, 7 (12.5%) had one or more occlusions, 3 early and 4 late (p less than 0.01). Preoperatively, the beta-thromboglobulin level in surgical patients (29 +/- 13.5 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that of 51 control subjects (22.6 +/- 11.1 ng/ml) (p less than 0.004). Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels remained comparatively constant at 3 and 12 months after surgery in the 43 patients who had both samples available (p less than 0.001, r = 0.65). The reduction in beta-thromboglobulin concentration from the preoperative level to 12 months postoperatively was greater in the aspirin-treated group (p less than 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between preoperative beta-thromboglobulin concentration and graft occlusion (p less than 0.02), and aspirin treatment was effective in preventing occlusion when adjusted for the preoperative beta-thromboglobulin level (p less than 0.005). Plasma beta-thromboglobulin concentrations are elevated in patients with coronary artery disease, suggesting ongoing platelet activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Aortic and pulmonary flow were measured by the systolic time integrals of the amplitude-weighted mean velocity from continuous wave Doppler spectra recorded over the aortic and pulmonary valves. Thus, measurements are independent of the left and right ventricular outflow tract area. In 20 normal subjects, aortic regurgitant fraction ranged between -2.9% and +12.0% (mean +4.3%), the physiologic value being +2%. In 20 patients with pure aortic regurgitation, aortic regurgitant fraction obtained by Doppler spectra (y) was compared with that calculated from biplane left ventriculography and cardiac output determined with the Fick method (x). The correlation was r = 0.94, (SEE = 5.4%, which is 10.6% of the angiography-Fick mean value). The regression line was y = 0.87x + 6.6 (mean y = 51.2%, mean x = 51.1%). It is concluded that determination of aortic regurgitant fraction in pure aortic regurgitation by using the amplitude-weighted mean velocity from continuous wave Doppler spectra is accurate and allows easy noninvasive evaluation of the regurgitant fraction in routine clinical applications.\r"

Reproduction of criteria established in vitro allowed discrimination of congenital valvular morphology in all 15 patients, including 7 in whom assessment by intravascular ultrasound was confirmed by subsequent pathologic examination.

Thirty caregivers were allocated to receive the experimental intervention consisting of: caregiver-focused health care, education about dementia and caregiving, assistance with problem solving, regularly scheduled in-home respite, and a self-help family caregiver support group. Thirty control subjects received conventional community nursing care. Before completion of the intervention, 18 (30%) were withdrawn, almost equally from each group. The most frequent reason was long-term institutionalization of the demented relative (n = 10). At baseline, caregivers in both groups were suffering from above-average levels of depression and anxiety. After the six-month intervention period, we found neither experimental nor control group improved in these areas. However, the experimental group showed a clinically important improvement in quality of life, experienced a slightly longer mean time to long-term institutionalization, found the caregiver role less problematic, and had greater satisfaction with nursing care than the control group.\r"

  ".W": "Comprehensive geriatric assessment has emerged as an effective strategy for improving outcomes for frail older patients in the hospital setting. Attention, however, has not been given to determining whether this process has any effect on their family caregivers. As part of a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of early interdisciplinary geriatric assessment for acutely ill hospitalized patients 75 years of age or older, their family caregivers were studied to determine if the process had a positive effect on caregivers' self-reported health and emotional well-being. One hundred forty-two caregivers were approximately evenly distributed between experimentals (n = 69) and controls (n = 73). By three months after the patients' hospitalization, experimental caregivers were more likely to report good general health (81% vs 63%, P = .049) than were controls. The positive effect persisted after statistical adjustment for confounding variables. Experimental caregivers were not significantly more likely to have good emotional health at follow-up than were controls (65% vs 58%, P = .43), even after statistical adjustment. Although the findings are modest, they suggest that the acute hospital setting may be an ideal place to develop interventions designed to enhance family caregivers' well-being during the early months following hospitalization. This may be particularly true when the interventions with caregivers are coupled with a geriatric assessment and care plan process.\r"

Previously, we demonstrated that the LFA-1 molecule (CD11a/CD18) can also regulate the induction of proliferation of peripheral blood T cells. In these studies, we observed opposite effects of antibodies against CD11a (LFA-1-alpha-chain) or CD18 (LFA-1-beta-chain). Here, we determined the effects of anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 mAb on proliferation of cloned influenza virus-specific T cells. Anti-CD18 mAb had similar inhibiting effects on the proliferative response of T cell clones induced by immobilized anti-CD3 mAb as it had on the response of peripheral blood T cells. In contrast to its costimulatory effect on resting peripheral blood T cells, anti-CD11a mAb did not increase the proliferation of cloned T cells. Similar differences in effects of anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 mAb were observed when proliferation of the T cell clones was induced by immobilized anti-TCR mAb. When proliferation was induced by influenza virus presented by monocytes as APC, both anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 mAb inhibited T cell proliferation. However, when EBV-transformed B cells were used as APC, neither anti-CD11a nor anti-CD18 mAb inhibited proliferation. These results demonstrate that the effects of antibodies against CD11a (LFA-1-alpha) or CD18 (LFA-1-beta) on T cell proliferation depend on 1) the stage of activation of the T cells, 2) the activation stimulus and its requirement for intercellular adhesion involving LFA-1, and 3) the type of cell used to present Ag.\r"

  ".W": "CD4+ murine T cell clones, TH1 and TH2, can be distinguished by both functional responses and by their patterns of lymphokine secretion. Recently, a mAb, 23G2, which reacts with a subset of CD45 molecules (CD45R), has been reported to bind differentially to clones of TH1 and TH2 cells. In the present study, normal splenic T cells were analyzed for differences in 23G2-reactivity and were separated into two populations based on their density of CD45R (CD45Rhi and CD45Rlo). The CD45Rhi cells secrete more IL-2 than IL-4 after stimulation in vitro; the reverse is true for the CD45Rlo cells. Because neither population secretes only IL-2 or IL-4, we were unable to classify cells as TH1 or TH2. In vivo and in vitro analyses of the CD45Rhi and CD45Rlo cells suggest a lineage relationship between the two subsets that correlates with the degree of Ag exposure and the state of maturation of the mice. In newborn mice and mice raised under sterile conditions, splenic CD4+ T cells are predominantly CD45Rhi. Under conditions of increased antigenic exposure and maturation of the mice, CD45Rlo cells develop; after long term priming in vivo, the majority of specific Ag-reactive cells are CD45Rlo. Adoptive transfer studies using BALB/c nu/nu recipients demonstrate that CD45Rhi cells become CD45Rlo cells and that the recall response (IgG) to specific Ag is mediated by CD45Rlo cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the level of expression of CD45R on CD4+ T cells distinguishes virgin (CD45Rhi) from primed/memory (CD45Rlo) T cells in normal mice.\r"

  ".W": "Some T cell hybridomas, upon activation via the TCR, rapidly undergo cell death. In this paper, we demonstrate that this activation-induced cell death (AICD) is accompanied by morphologic changes seen at the electron and light microscopy levels. The most striking changes are an extensive condensation of the chromatin and formation of membrane blebs. In addition to the morphologic changes, a significant portion of genomic DNA is broken at an interval of approximately 200 bp, producing a ladder of oligonucleosome-sized fragments after gel electrophoresis. Taken together, these observations indicate that AICD proceeds via apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This is additionally supported by the observation that AICD-associated phenomena are at least partially inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Curiously, AICD and its associated DNA fragmentation are completely inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid, a known nuclease inhibitor. The possible relationship between AICD in vitro, and the negative selection process (wherein selection may proceed via AICD of developing, autoreactive thymocytes) is discussed.\r"

Most strikingly, CD4+/45RA+ but not CD4+/45RA- T cells responded to anti-CD3 Ab and IL-4. Similar difference in response to IL-4 occurred when the subsets were stimulated by two \"alternative\" T cell activation pathways via CD2 and GD3 Ag. The response of CD4+/45RA+ cells to anti-CD3 Ab and IL-4 was enhanced by the two monokines: IL-1 and IL-6. Further differences between the subsets included the preferential response of the CD4+/45RA+ cells to enhancing effect of IL-6 on proliferation mediated by the anti-CD3 Ab and IL-2. In contrast to IL-6, IL-1 was unable to increase this proliferation significantly. In turn, the CD4+/45RA- cells responded preferentially to a weak stimulation mediated by anti-CD3 Ab either alone, or together with IL-1 and IL-6. Existence of these significant differences in the response of CD4+ T cell subsets costimulatory effects of the cytokines, suggests that the in vivo events resulting in an accumulation of the cytokines in particular combinations may lead to selective activation of one of the CD4+ T cell subsets during the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the expression of HLA Ag on hemopoietic progenitors (burst-forming unit E, CFU-E, and CFU-granulocyte-macrophage) and precursors from human embryonic fetal liver (FL) and peripheral blood at 5 to 9 wk postconception. The expression on progenitors was evaluated by complement-mediated cytotoxicity followed by assay of residual progenitors in clonogenic culture; immunofluorescence and RIA were used for differentiated precursors. HLA Class I and II Ag are not expressed on the primitive erythroid lineage, i.e., on yolk sac-derived megaloblasts circulating in 5- to 6-wk peripheral blood. However, they are gradually induced on the definitive erythroid lineage in FL. Their expression on progenitors is first detected at 6 wk and shows a progressive increase through 9 wk, up to greater than or equal to 50% of adult values. A similar expression pattern is observed for FL erythroblasts. Incubation of 6-wk FL erythroid cells with IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma, or TNF-alpha induces a sharp rise of the expression of HLA class I, but not HLA class II Ag on both progenitors and precursors. In contrast, incubation with PHA-stimulated adult leukocyte-conditioned medium causes a marked increase of both HLA-ABC and HLA class II Ag expression. We hence investigated the effect of cytokines present in leukocyte-conditioned medium on the expression of HLA class II Ag: although IL-1 alpha, IL-2, and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF do not exert a significant action, IL-1 beta and IL-4 induce a marked increase of HLA class II, but not class I, Ag expression on 6-wk FL progenitors and precursors. Low amounts of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta were detected in the supernatants and extracts of 6-wk FL cells. The concentrations of these cytokines in both supernatants and extracts sharply increase in the 7- to 8-wk period, particularly for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, thus indicating a direct correlation with the rise of HLA Ag expression on FL erythroid cells in the same period. In conclusion, the expression of HLA class I and II Ag is not detected on primitive megaloblasts, but is gradually induced on definitive FL progenitors and precursors, possibly via production of specific cytokines in the FL microenvironment, i.e., IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha for class I Ag and IL-1 beta for class II Ag.\r"

GM-CSF enhanced PMN 35S-methionine incorporation 1.5-fold over a 2-h incubation period. The effect of GM-CSF on the synthesis of specific proteins was investigated by separating the radiolabeled proteins on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Stimulation of protein synthesis by GM-CSF was rapid (2 h), dose dependent, and affected at least 10 separate polypeptides. Using ion exchange chromatography some of the GM-CSF-enhanced proteins were identified to have a cationic nature, including the 37- and the 57-kDA proteins whose synthesis was increased by GM-CSF 2.4-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. The cationic protein fractions from GM-CSF-primed and control cells were eluted from an ion exchange column and tested for their antimicrobial activity. An overall twofold increase in the amount of cationic proteins was recovered from GM-CSF-treated cells as compared to control cells, and these proteins showed a proportional enhanced killing of S. typhimurium. These results suggest that enhanced cationic protein synthesis is an important mechanism whereby GM-CSF can increase neutrophil microbicidal activity via nonoxidative pathways.\r"

Emerging as an important immunomodulatory molecule, TGF-beta may also regulate the phenotype and function of mononuclear cells within an inflammatory site. In this study TGF-beta is shown to induce expression of the gp50-65 receptor for Fc gamma RIII on otherwise negative peripheral blood monocytes. Circulating monocytes express Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII, but not Fc gamma RIII, and no inducing agent for Fc gamma RIII has previously been identified. Within hours after exposure of freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes to picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2, mRNA specific for Fc gamma RIII is detectable followed by expression of the receptors on the cell surface. Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta completely inhibit the TGF-beta-induced up-regulation of Fc gamma RIII. In contrast to TGF-beta, other cytokines involved in the inflammatory response are ineffective in regulating Fc gamma RIII expression on human monocytes. Thus, the early release of TGF-beta by platelets in an inflammatory site may foster enhanced immunophagocytosis and contribute to host defense by inducing monocyte Fc gamma RIII expression.\r"

  ".W": "In many cells, protein kinase C (PKC) activation inhibits cellular phospholipase C thereby preventing receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism. In T lymphocytes, the T cell antigen receptor (Ti)/CD3 complex regulates PI hydrolysis and we have examined the consequences of PKC activation on Ti/CD3-mediated PI metabolism in human peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes (T lymphoblasts) and the leukemic T cell line Jurkat. In Jurkat cells, PI metabolism after Ti/CD3 stimulation, is inhibited by PKC activation. PKC activation also inhibits calcium-induced PI metabolism in permeabilized Jurkat cells. In marked contrast, PI metabolism after Ti/CD3 stimulation in T lymphoblasts, is not inhibited by PKC activation. Moreover, in permeabilized T lymphoblasts PI metabolism can be induced by calcium in synergy with guanine 5'-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate) via a PKC-insensitive mechanism. The different effect of PKC stimulation on PI metabolism in Jurkat cells and T lymphoblasts reveals heterogeneity of PLC regulation in T lymphocytes. The data also indicate that the role of PKC as a regulator of Ti/CD3 signal transduction can differ depending on cell type.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative response of T cells is known to decrease with age of the T cell donor. We now report that this proliferative defect affects both major subsets (CD4+, CD8- and CD4-, CD8+) of peripheral T cells from old humans. Furthermore, this proliferative defect can be detected within the first hours after addition of mitogen by a reduction in the steady state levels of c-myc mRNA in T cell cultures from old donors. Lymphocytes from old humans cultured with PHA have less than 50% of the level of c-myc message than do such cultures from young donors. Nuclear run-on assays suggest that the decreased steady state level of c-myc mRNA in cultures from old donors is caused by reduced transcription of the c-myc gene in T cells from old donors. The age-associated defect in transcription of the c-myc gene affects the second exon to a greater extent than the first, noncoding exon. Individual T lymphocytes from old donors that do express c-myc message, detected by in situ hybridization, have the same intracellular level of c-myc message as T lymphocytes from young donors. These data add additional support for the hypothesis that the proliferative defect of T lymphocytes from old humans is caused by the smaller fraction of T cells from old as compared with young humans that can be activated by mitogens to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".U": "90229756\r", 
  ".W": "The t(14;18) of human follicular B cell lymphoma translocates the Bcl-2 gene into the Ig H chain locus and markedly deregulates Bcl-2 expression. We sought to determine if Bcl-2 could be directly implicated in a growth-factor pathway. Consequently, we introduced a retrovirus containing the murine Bcl-2 gene (N2-M-Bcl-2) or the parental retrovirus (N2) into a series of factor-dependent hemopoietic cell lines. Overexpressed Bcl-2 resulted in no long term IL-2, IL-3, or IL-6 independent clones, indicating that Bcl-2 could not spare the need for a specific ligand-receptor interaction. However, Bcl-2 did extend the short term survival of IL-3-dependent cell lines after factor deprivation. Although viable, IL-3-deprived pro B lymphocytes (FL5.12) bearing N2-M-Bcl-2 were in Go, and deregulated Bcl-2 did not obviously influence cell-cycle progression. Bcl-2 predominant effects were to delay the onset of cell death and to modestly augment viable cell growth in the first 48 h after IL-3 deprivation. This death sparing was associated with increased levels of Bcl-2 RNA and protein in factor-deprived cells possessing N2-M-Bcl-2. This result was not restricted to prolymphocytes because an IL-3-dependent mast cell line (32D) as well as a promyeloid line (FDC-P1) demonstrated the same response to Bcl-2. Moreover, the effect was not limited to the IL-3/IL-3R signal transduction pathway in that promyeloid cells maintained in granulocyte-macrophage-CSF or IL-4 displayed a similar response. Yet, Bcl-2-enhanced cell survival was not universal as an IL-2-dependent T cell line, and an IL-6-dependent myeloma line demonstrated no consistent effect upon IL withdrawal. Thus, Bcl-2 appears to interfere with cell death but in a cell type and/or factor-restricted fashion.\r"

Detection of this hormone in bloodstains is of special interest for pregnancy diagnosis in forensic science applications. The experimental series comprises 60 bloodstains prepared in our laboratory and obtained from blood samples taken from 30 pregnant women and 30 healthy, nonpregnant individuals. The bloodstains were studied at different stages of aging over a 6-month period, each sample being stored at 2 different temperatures throughout the process. The experimental evidence proves HCG to be a useful and stable diagnostic indicator of pregnancy in bloodstains. In addition, the technique used is fast, as well as highly sensitive and specific.\r"

  ".W": "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease) is defined by the dominant or codominant deposition of IgA in the renal mesangium. There is much evidence in vitro to suggest up-regulation of the IgA immune response in patients. Data from tonsillar and bone marrow-derived lymphocytes and from in vivo immunization studies indicate that the primary defect is an up-regulated systemic one, rather than mucosal IgA production. Several lines of evidence suggest that increased IgA production alone is inadequate to explain the pathogenesis of Berger disease. Murine models of IgA nephropathy indicate that local complement activation mediated by deposited IgG is essential for mesangial cell proliferation and subsequent renal injury. Circulating immune complexes from patients with Berger disease contain IgA and IgG within the same lattice. In vitro studies of model immune aggregates containing various mixtures of IgA and IgG indicate that the IgG is the site of complement activation and fixation. The IgA in the aggregate actually inhibits both complement activation and binding to erythrocyte complement receptor CR1. This effect of IgA may prevent effective immune complex clearance. In future studies, more emphasis should be placed on the roles of IgG and complement in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the prevalence and predictors of, and the glucose responses after, nocturnal hypoglycemia, we studied 135 pediatric patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on 388 nights. The frequencies of blood glucose values less than 60, 50, and 40 mg/dl (3.3, 2.8, and 2.2 mmol/L) at 2 AM were 14.4%, 7.0%, and 2.1%, and at 6 AM were 6.7%, 2.6%, and 0.5%, respectively. Longer duration of diabetes, higher daily insulin doses, and lower glycosylated hemoglobin values were all significant but weak predictors of 2 AM hypoglycemia (glucose less than or equal to 60 mg/dl (less than or equal to 3.3 mmol/L). A 10 PM glucose concentration less than or equal to 100 mg/dl (less than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L) was present on 48% of nights with 2 AM glucose values less than or equal to 60 mg/dl (less than or equal to 3.3 mmol/L), but only 24% of nights with 10 PM blood glucose values less than or equal to 100 mg/dl (less than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L) were followed by 2 AM hypoglycemia. After treatment of 70 episodes of 2 AM glucose concentrations less than or equal to 60 mg/dl (less than or equal to 3.3 mmol/L), mean 6 AM glucose concentration was 95 +/- 6 mg/dl (5.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) and less than or equal to 100 mg/dl in 68.6%. In only 4.3% of these cases was the 6 AM glucose concentration greater than 200 mg/dl (greater than 11.1 mmol/L). Among patients who experienced 2 AM hypoglycemia, after-breakfast glucose values were not greater on days with 2 AM hypoglycemia than on days without it. These data indicate that 2 AM hypoglycemia is relatively common in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is frequently preceded by a 10 PM glucose value less than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L, and is less well predicted by other factors. Appropriate treatment of 2 AM hypoglycemia seldom results in either before-breakfast or after-breakfast blood glucose values greater than 200 mg/dl (greater than 11.1 mmol/L). Early-morning hypoglycemia is an uncommon cause of otherwise unexplained, prebreakfast hyperglycemia in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

(+)-3-PPP, (+)-SKF 10047, MK 801 and TCP potentiated contractile responses to norepinephrine, an effect which was blocked by cocaine implying an action of these agents on monoamine uptake. In the presence of cocaine an additional postjunctional inhibitory action of (+)-3-PPP and (+)SKF 10047 on norepinephrine-induced contractile responses was unveiled. In contrast, haloperidol, (+/-)-BMY 14802, rimcazole and DTG inhibited contractile responses to norepinephrine. Haloperidol, (+/-)-BMY 14802 and (+)-SKF 10047 (+ uptake blockade) also inhibited contractile responses to serotonin. The order of potency for inhibition of norepinephrine-induced contractions was haloperidol greater than (+/-)-BMY 14802 greater than (+)-3-PPP greater than rimcazole greater than (+)-SKF 10047 (+ uptake blockade) greater than DTG. These studies demonstrate the lack of selectivity of many sigma and PCP ligands, significant effects on norepinephrine uptake, as well as the potential utility of the rat tail artery to explore the functional properties of these ligands.\r"

The rapid blockade and reappearance of synaptic transmission during hypoxia was not altered by these antagonists. However, [(+)-5-methyl-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5, 10-imine maleate (MK-801) (50 microM) and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (dl-AP5) (25 microM) delayed the disappearance of these reactivated orthodromic population spikes. Intracellular recordings showed that MK-801 and dl-AP5 delayed the late, but not early, hypoxic depolarization of pyramidal cells, and improved recovery of membrane potential and input resistance (Rin) in many cells after reoxygenation. No untreated cells showed recovery. Thus, both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists decreased the hypoxia-induced depolarization and Rin. With the return of evoked population spikes as an index for recovery from hypoxia, the ED50 values for dl-AP5, MK-801, phencyclidine and dextromethorphan were 7.7, 4.5, 7.1 and 75 microM, respectively. Thus, in contrast to their higher affinities for the NMDA receptor MK-801 and phencyclidine were not significantly more potent than dl-AP5 in protecting hippocampal slices from hypoxia, and isobolographic analysis revealed dose-additive interactions. The unexpectedly low potency of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists in protecting against hypoxia is attributed to magnesium in the buffer and the hypoxia-induced membrane depolarization, both of which have been shown to reduce the effectiveness of noncompetitive NMDA antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments studied the ontogeny of sympathetic control of the renin-angiotensin system by using pharmacological agents, which act at different levels of the sympathetic axis, to increase plasma renin activity (PRA) during the preweanling period in Sprague-Dawley rats. The selective beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, produced age- and dose-dependent PRA increases. In 5- and 10-day-old animals, prenalterol treatment produced minimal stimulation of PRA and the dose-response curve was essentially flat. In contrast, greater PRA responses to increasing doses of prenalterol were found in 15- and 20-day-old animals. The PRA response to tyramine, which causes norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic fibers, gradually increased between 5 and 20 postnatal days of age, first producing significant stimulation on day 15. Centrally mediated sympathetic activation with yohimbine also produced age-dependent stimulation of PRA that was comparable to the increases produced by tyramine between postnatal days 10 and 20. However, in contrast to tyramine, yohimbine produced a significant increase in PRA on postnatal day 5. The present results suggest that functional sympathetic control of the renin-angiotensin system matures during the second to third postnatal week in the Sprague-Dawley rat, and this may be related to the development of beta-1 adrenoceptors in the kidney that regulate renin release.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that bovine pineal glands not only contain D2 dopamine receptors, but also that dopamine has dual effects on the activity of pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase, inhibiting the basal activity at 0.1 microM and stimulating it at 10 microM. We report here that the bovine pineal gland also possesses D1 dopamine receptors, which were characterized by using [3H]SCH 23390, the selective D1 dopamine receptor antagonist. SCH 23390 bound to bovine pineal membranes in a stereoselective, saturable and reversible manner. The receptor density (Bmax) was 974 fmol/mg protein and the dissociation constant (KD), as determined by saturation studies, was 0.56 nM, which is in good agreement with the KD calculated from kinetic studies (0.40 nM). Dopaminergic receptor agonists and antagonists inhibited [3H]SCH 23390 binding in a concentration-dependent and stereoselective fashion, demonstrating a pharmacology characteristic of D1 dopamine receptors. On the other hand, serotonin and serotonin receptor antagonists had a very low potency in inhibiting [3H]SCH 23390 binding. Studies involving dopamine receptor agonists revealed a low density, high affinity binding site (10%) and a high density, low affinity binding site (90%) in the bovine pineal gland. The results of this study are interpreted to indicate that the effects of dopamine in the pineal gland are modulated through mechanisms that involve both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The dopamine (DA) DA-1 and DA-2 receptors coupled to 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generating system were characterized in membrane particles of the rat kidney medulla. In confirmation of reports using central and other peripheral tissues, activation of DA-1 receptors with DA, apomorphine or SKF 82526 induced accumulation of cAMP. This effect was blocked by the DA-1 receptors antagonist SCH 23390 and by the other DA-2 receptor antagonists fluphenazine and haloperidol. DA-2 receptor responses coupled negatively to the cAMP generating system were obtained by incubating renal medulla membrane particles with DA or SKF 82526 together with SCH 23390. DA-2 receptor responses were also elicited with the receptor agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine in the absence of SCH 23390. These inhibitory effects on cAMP generation were abolished by the DA-2 receptor antagonist l-sulpiride. Our findings suggest that rat renal medulla contains DA DA-1 and DA-2 receptors similar to those found in brain and in other peripheral tissues. The physiological significance of these receptors, if any, should be established in future studies.\r"

All animals had surgically implanted intrapleural catheters and some had arterial or right heart catheters as well. Animals were placed in plethysmographs and exposed to ascending doses of aerosolized agonists. The provocative dose, i.e., the dose that caused a clear bronchospastic response, was defined as the concentration that increased intrapleural pressure to at least 20 cm H2O. Results showed that bronchospasm was characterized further by decreases in dynamic lung compliance and arterial PO2 and an increase in airway resistance. The accumulation of trapped gas in the lung, after challenge, measured in the excised collapsed lung correlated with the increase in intrapleural pressure and with the fall in lung compliance. Male guinea pigs between 3- and 15-weeks of age did not vary in sensitivity to histamine. Methacholine and histamine were equipotent and produced similar responses. Tachyphylaxis was not demonstrated for either compound. In addition, the provocative dose for the drugs remained stable on a day-to-day basis. These results offer insight into the nature of the bronchospastic response in guinea pigs and provide new data on response to methacholine.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied systematically the distribution of receptors for substance P in the airway smooth muscle of the rabbit using both functional studies and light-microscopic autoradiography. Four areas of the respiratory tract were examined: the midtrachea (T1) and proximal, middle and distal portions of the right main bronchus (B1, B2 and B3, respectively). The magnitude of the contractile response to substance P in preparations from six to eight animals was location-dependent, increasing significantly from proximal to distal areas. Maximal tension expressed as a function of tissue weight +/- S.E.M. was 24.8 +/- 3 for T1, 39 +/- 10 for B1, 108 +/- 31 for B2 and 160 +/- 42 for B3. The potency of substance P in B2 and B3 was significantly greater (EC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7) M; 2.8 x 10(-7) M, respectively) than that in T1 (2.5 x 10(-6) M). After inhibition of endogenous enkephalinase by phosphoramidon there was an increase in sensitivity to substance P in both T1 (EC50 = 2.3 x 10(-7) M, n = 5) and B3 (2.6 x 10(-9) M, n = 5). There was remarkable agreement in the results obtained with autoradiography. No binding sites (0) were visualized to Bolton Hunter substance P in T1. Sparse but specific binding (+) was seen in B1, whereas it was marked ( ) in B2 and very dense ( ++) in B3. Thus, our results have shown that receptors for substance P are more numerous in the distal than proximal airways of the rabbit. This may indicate a physiological role for substance P in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone in the distal airways.\r"

  ".W": "In a modified Krebs buffer at 37 degrees C, the selective mu agonist [3H] D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin [( 3H]DAMGO) and the nonselective mu/delta agonist human [125I]beta-endorphin [( 125I]beta-endH) bound to rat striatal membranes with a Kd of about 7 and 5 nM and a Bmax of about 95 and 260 fmol/mg of protein, respectively, consistent with labeling of mu receptors by the former ligand and labeling of both mu and delta receptors by the latter. The binding of 2 nM [125I]beta-endH was displaced by unlabeled DAMGO (IC50 30 nM), [D-Ala2-D-Leu5]enkephalin (IC50 60 nM) as well as by the selective delta agonists [D-Ser2(O-tert-butyl),Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6 (DSTBULET, IC50 500 nM) and Tyr-Ala-Phe-Asp-Val-Val-Gly-NH2 (IC50 700 nM) in a monophasic manner within 2 to 3 log concentration units, suggesting an allosteric interaction between mu and delta sites labeled by [125I]beta-endH under these conditions. Accordingly, 500 nM DSTBULET caused almost 40% inhibition of the apparent Bmax without changing the apparent Kd of [3H] DAMGO. The kappa agonist U 50,488 was ineffective as competing ligand even at a concentration of 10 microM. Upon affinity cross-linking of [125I]beta-endH (2 nM) to rat striatal mu- and delta-opioid receptors, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized tissue under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography of the dried gels revealed a major broad band of covalently labeled protein with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Strenuous exercise makes extraordinary demands. The transition from rest to intensive physical activity can cause pathological changes in various organs, particularly in the urinary tract. Hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic) is one of the abnormalities commonly found after sports activity. This phenomenon can occur in noncontact sports (such as rowing, running and swimming) as well as in contact sports (boxing, football and so forth). The pathophysiology can be either traumatic or nontraumatic. Renal trauma and/or bladder injury due to repeated impact of the posterior bladder wall against the bladder base can cause vascular lesions and consequently hematuria. There are 2 mechanisms of nontraumatic injury. 1) Vasoconstriction of the splanchnic and renal vessels occurs during exercise in order that blood can be redistributed to the contracting skeletal muscles, thus causing hypoxic damage to the nephron. This results in increased glomerular permeability which would favor increased excretion of erythrocytes and protein into the urine. 2) A relatively more marked constriction of the efferent glomerular arterioli results in an increased filtration pressure, which favors increased excretion of protein and red blood cells into the urine. It must be noted that sports hematuria differs from other conditions that may cause reddish discoloration of the urine due to physical exercise, such as march hemoglobinuria and exercise myoglobinuria. In the latter 2 abnormalities there is excretion of hemoglobin and myoglobin molecules in the urine and not whole blood or intact red blood cells. Sports hematuria usually has a benign self-limited course. However, coexisting urinary tract pathological conditions should be excluded carefully.\r"

The latter was performed in a sleep laboratory setting in all patients. The results of penile duplex ultrasonography with papaverine injection were classified as 18 patients with normal vascular findings, 22 with arterial insufficiency, 3 with the pelvic steal syndrome and 7 with isolated venous leakage. Of the patients 15 had normal ultrasonographic and nocturnal penile tumescence findings, 29 had abnormal ultrasonographic vascular and nocturnal penile tumescence findings, 3 had abnormal ultrasonographic vascular findings and normal nocturnal penile tumescence (including 1 with the pelvic steal syndrome as evidenced by penile brachial index) and 3 had normal ultrasonographic vascular findings and abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence (including 2 with neurogenic erectile dysfunction). Penile duplex ultrasonography with papaverine injection appears to be a useful objective method to evaluate vasculogenic impotence and to correlate favorably with nocturnal penile tumescence monitoring. It also may have a higher yield than nocturnal penile tumescence monitoring in patients with the pelvic steal syndrome. While nocturnal penile tumescence is impaired in patients with neurogenic impotence, penile duplex ultrasonography with papaverine injection reveals, as expected, normal findings in patients with neurogenic impotence and normal vascular systems.\r"

Invasion of the prostatic urethra was not detected by transrectal ultrasound but 5 of the 7 stromal lesions exhibited hypoechogenicity. All cancer-laden ejaculatory ducts were hypoechoic on ultrasound examination. All cases of periprostatic involvement were also detectable by corresponding areas of hypoechogenicity.

  ".U": "90230372\r", 
  ".W": "Most gas-forming infections occur in patients with diabetes. Carbon dioxide formation, resulting from fermentation of the high concentration of sugar in the urine and tissue by infecting organisms, was regarded as the key factor of gas formation in previous reports. Gas from an emphysematous infection of a polycystic kidney was analyzed to understand better the mechanisms involved in gas-forming infections of the urinary tract. The term emphysematous renal polycystic infection is proposed for this particular condition. Gas from the cysts contained 4.1% carbon dioxide, 10.5% oxygen, 67.3% nitrogen and 18.1% unknown gas. This finding is astonishingly similar to that of Wheeler in 1954 and cannot be fully explained by the sugar fermentation theory. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis. Impaired transportation of gas produced by rapid catabolism leads to gas accumulation in the tissue, which will gradually expand and create chambers to form gas bubbles. Gas of adjacent tissues will attempt to come into equilibrium with the gas bubbles. Positive equilibrium will lead to continuous expansion of the lesion bubble. However, if the chamber is unable to withstand the increasing pressure then rupture or spontaneous drainage of the gas bubble may occur. During negative equilibrium gas in the bubble gradually simulates tissue gas with eventual shrinkage of the bubble. If the chamber is unable to sustain the pressure it collapses and the bubble disappears. However, if the chamber is capable of sustaining the pressure the bubble still may persist even when the gas content is equivalent to tissue gas. This hypothesis may lead to better understanding of emphysematous infections of the urinary tract and also may cast light on emphysematous infections of other organ systems.\r"

We review 30 cases of clinically diagnosed leiomyoma of the kidney from the literature, including 4 new cases with emphasis on the computerized tomography findings. Computerized tomography may locate a renal leiomyoma serendipitously in an asymptomatic patient. If the lesion is peripheral or in the parapelvic area and a plane can be seen between the tumor and kidney a capsular tumor, such as a leiomyoma of the kidney, might be considered in addition to the more common renal cell carcinoma. Renal leiomyomas have a variable radiographic pattern from that of a pure cystic to a mixed solid/cystic to an entirely solid lesion. Renal leiomyomas usually are sharply demarcated from the surroundings. Although computerized tomography cannot distinguish a renal leiomyoma from other benign or malignant renal processes the presence of invasion can virtually eliminate this benign tumor as a diagnosis. Since a preoperative diagnosis cannot be made, management involves renal exploration and radical nephrectomy in the larger lesions with a renal-sparing operation possible in selected cases. After treatment patients have a uniformly excellent prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The DATTA panelists considered aerosolized pentamidine to be both safe and effective for primary and secondary prophylaxis of PCP. T4 helper cell counts offer guidance as to the best candidates for primary prophylaxis. Patients with a T4 helper cell count of fewer than 200/mm3 are the most appropriate group to receive primary prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine. However, T4 helper cell counts are not an exclusive criterion for aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. Some DATTA panelists suggested that certain patients, such as those with Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas and those with concomitant human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection, might be considered candidates for aerosolized pentamidine regardless of T4 helper cell counts. There is no current literature to support this, and this opinion is based solely on clinical experience. Perhaps the use of other markers of immune function (beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin) in conjunction with T4 helper cell counts will give a better indication of when to start primary prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine is not the only potential prophylactic regimen for PCP. Other drugs, including pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and dapsone, are currently being evaluated. Prior diagnosis and therapy for patients with M tuberculosis must occur before initiation of the use of aerosolized pentamidine. This and other appropriate environmental precautions should reduce transmission of M tuberculosis to health care workers and other patients. Whether any prophylactic treatment of an opportunistic infection will prolong survival in HIV-infected individuals has yet to be proved. The assumption is made, however, that a reduction in opportunistic infections should lower mortality and improve the quality of life.\r"

Patients with sustained atrial fibrillation or flutter for more than 2 hours' duration, stable hemodynamic status, and prior digoxin therapy were randomized to receive either intravenous amiodarone, 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes (41 patients), or oral quinidine, 400 mg immediately and 400 mg in 4 hours (39 patients), with cross-over at 8 hours if reversion was not achieved. Thirty-six patients had a coronary artery operation, 35 a valvular operation, five had both, and there were four miscellaneous cases. There was a male:female ratio of 1.5:1 and a mean age of 58 years (range 23 to 75 years). Preoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter was present in nine patients, and four patients had an ejection fraction less than 40%. Twenty-five of 39 patients (64%) given quinidine first reverted to sinus rhythm, compared with 17 of 41 patients (41%) given amiodarone first (2p = 0.04). Side-effects occurred in 18 patients given quinidine and five patients given amiodarone (2p = 0.01). Two patients, both given quinidine, were withdrawn from the study. There was no correlation, with either drug, between serum levels and clinical efficacy. Multivariate analysis identified longer times from arrhythmia to treatment, preoperative atrial fibrillation, mitral valve operations, and concomitant propranolol therapy as factors predictive of failure to revert to sinus rhythm. Oral quinidine was more effective than intravenous amiodarone in reverting postoperative atrial fibrillation and flutter but caused more side-effects.\r"

Each panelist then rated the cases on a 7-point scale based on maximum acceptable waiting time for surgery; 1 on the scale represented emergency surgery and 7 delays of up to 6 months. For only 1% of cases was there agreement on a single rating by at least 12/16 panelists. Results of this ranking exercise were used by the panel to draw up triage guidelines. The three main urgency determinants were severity and stability of symptoms of angina, coronary anatomy from angiographic studies, and results of non-invasive tests for risk of ischaemia. Together these three factors generally gave an urgency rating for any given case to within less than 0.25 scale points of the value predicted with all factors. A numerical scoring system was derived to permit rapid estimation of the panel's recommended ratings.\r"

Recurrence rates were lower when treatment consisted of lateral rhinotomy with medial maxillectomy (14%) vs. transnasal operation with a sinus procedure (35%) or transnasal operation alone (58%). Recurrence rates between men and women were not significantly different when treatment methods were analyzed; however, a higher-than-expected association with tobacco usage was noted. Eight (7%) of the 112 patients had associated nasal carcinoma. Current treatment is lateral rhinotomy with medial maxillectomy to prevent troublesome and potentially malignant recurrent disease.\r"

In that report, routine lateral rhinotomy with en bloc resection of the lateral nasal wall, including the entire schneiderian membrane, was recommended. This report emphasizes the use of computed tomography scanning in management planning. Of 33 patients with inverted papilloma treated between 1969 and 1987, 7 had associated squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty-two patients with IP alone were treated with medial maxillectomy; however, 3 patients have been successfully treated with either a Caldwell-Luc/ethmoidectomy or an external ethmoidectomy for localized disease. The use of computed tomography capable of higher resolution allowed preoperative determination of the extent of disease, enabling the surgeon to plan the surgery more precisely. Patients were followed for an average of 9.6 years. Recurrent disease occurred in one patient (4%) following a lateral rhinotomy/medial maxillectomy approach. The principles set forth in this series of patients remain the same as those previously described due to the unique characteristics of this tumor: its ability to destroy bone, its tendency to recur, and its association with malignancy. The technique of lateral rhinotomy and en bloc excision of the lateral nasal wall, followed by meticulous removal of all mucosa in the ipsilateral paranasal sinuses, remains the standard therapy.\r"

The same chemotherapy was used in both arms: 6 mg/m2 vinblastine sulfate, hour 0; 30 mg bleomycin, hour 6; 200 mg methotrexate, hours 24 to 26; 45 mg leucovorin, hour 48. Forty-five patients had stage III disease and 71 had stage IV disease. All patients were evaluated for survival, 112 for toxicity, and 105 for analyses of response and time from the start of treatment until progression of disease. At the end of the combined treatment, we observed an overall response rate of 52% in arm A and an overall response rate of 64.9% in arm B. The incidence of mucositis was more relevant in arm B compared to arm A (P less than .00004). The difference in complete response, progression-free survival, and survival was statistically significant, with an advantage for arm B (P less than .03, P less than .02, and P less than .03, respectively). The analysis at a median follow-up of 36 months (range = 19 to 59) demonstrates a higher effectiveness for the alternating program.\r"

  ".W": "Primary biliary cirrhosis is a progressive disease of the liver characterized by the immunologic destruction of bile ducts; effective therapy is lacking. We therefore evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose cyclosporine in 29 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis without evidence of damage to the lobular architecture (precirrhotic disease) or portal hypertension. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cyclosporine (4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo. After one year 17 of the 19 patients assigned to cyclosporine had improvement or stability in their degree of fatigue, and 18 in their degree of pruritus. In contrast, among the 10 patients assigned to placebo, fatigue increased in 4 (P less than 0.06) and pruritus worsened in 6 (P less than 0.001). Those assigned to cyclosporine also had significant decreases in serum levels of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma globulin, and the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies. For the 20 patients who have completed two years in the study, liver biopsies (coded specimens) showed evidence of histologic progression in only 1 of 13 patients in the cyclosporine group, as compared with 5 of 7 in the placebo group (P less than 0.003). No patient has permanently discontinued cyclosporine because of side effects; however, signs of nephrotoxicity developed in 12 of 19, and 9 of 19 had increased blood pressure. We conclude that in patients with precirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine is promising and deserves further evaluation.\r"

This syndrome was found only in patients with nonseminomatous mediastinal germ-cell tumors, particularly those with serologic or histologic evidence of yolk-sac elements. The two most common hematologic neoplasms seen in this syndrome were acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and malignant histiocytosis. Consistent cytogenetic abnormalities have not yet been identified, but the finding of the marker chromosome isochromosome (12p) in the mediastinal germ-cell tumor and associated leukemic blasts in one patient suggests that these tumors may arise from a common progenitor cell.\r"

  ".W": "The use of interferon for the induction treatment of multiple myeloma has been shown to be effective in about 20 percent of patients. We studied its effects on long-term survival when it was used for maintenance treatment. Between April 1985 and May 1988, 101 patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma who had had a substantial objective response or a lesser objective response with disappearance of symptoms (\"disease stabilization\") after 12 courses of induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b as maintenance therapy (n = 50) or to receive no treatment (n = 51). As of December 1989, 66 of the 101 patients have relapsed (25 given interferon and 41 not treated). The median duration of response (from the time of randomization) was 26 months in the patients given interferon and 14 months in the untreated patients (P = 0.0002). A total of 37 patients have died (14 given interferon and 23 not treated). The median duration of survival (from randomization) was 52 months in the interferon group and 39 months in the control group (P = 0.0526). Among the patients who had had a substantial objective response to induction chemotherapy, the difference in survival time was statistically significant (P = 0.03526). Interferon had to be stopped because of toxic effects in 3 of 12 patients initially treated with 10 MU (megaunits) per square meter of body-surface area. After the dose was reduced to 3 MU per square meter, the only toxic effect was a mild influenza-like syndrome lasting two to three weeks. We conclude that maintenance treatment with interferon prolongs response and survival in patients with multiple myeloma who have responded to conventional induction chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, is strongly linked with two relatively rare forms of B-cell lymphoma and with a much more prevalent epithelial malignancy, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The availability of suitable culture systems has allowed detailed analysis of EBV-induced growth transformation in B lymphocytes, but little is known about the virus--epithelial cell interaction or about the possible effector role of viral proteins in the pathogenesis of NPC. Here we describe an experimental system to monitor the effects of introduced viral or cellular genes upon human epithelial cell growth and differentiation. We transfected a human epithelial cell line, which retains several features of normal keratinocyte behaviour in vitro, with the EBV gene encoding latent membrane protein (LMP), one of only two viral proteins known to be expressed in NPC cells in vivo. LMP expression was accompanied by changes in the epithelial cell surface phenotype, mimicking surface changes observed in NPC cells, and by severe impairment of the cellular response to differentiation signals. The ability of LMP to inhibit terminal differentiation indicates a mechanism whereby EBV infection of squamous epithelium could contribute to the multi-step pathogenesis of NPC.\r"

A number of environmental stresses (such as osmotic shock and anaerobiosis) have been shown to induce changes in DNA supercoiling that can directly affect the transcription of a specific subset of bacterial genes, at least some of which (the outer-membrane porins and type 1 fimbriae) play a part in bacterial virulence. Here, we demonstrate that the virR gene of S. flexneri, implicated in the temperature regulation of plasmid-encoded virulence genes, is equivalent to the osmZ gene of Escherichia coli, which has previously been shown to mediate its regulatory effects through changes in DNA supercoiling. Our results imply that environmentally induced changes in DNA supercoiling are important in the coordinated control of virulence gene expression in S. flexneri and have general implications for the control of bacterial virulence.\r"

However, although most non-living intact protein preparations induce antibodies and CD4+ major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted helper and/or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), they do not elicit CD8+ MHC class I restricted CTL. Indeed, with a few exceptions, it has not so far been possible to induce CD8+ CTL by immunizing with intact soluble proteins. We show here that a single subcutaneous immunization in mice with immunostimulating complexes containing either purified intact gp160 envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or influenza haemagglutinin results in reproducible and long-lasting priming of HIV specific or influenza-specific CD8+, MHC class I restricted CTL.\r"

Isl-1 contains a homeodomain with greatest similarity to those of the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins encoded by mec-3 and lin-11. In addition, Isl-1, like the lin-11 and mec-3 gene products, contains a novel Cys-His domain which is reminiscent of known metal-binding regions. Together these proteins define a novel class of proteins containing both a homeo- and a Cys His-domain. Isl-1 is preferentially expressed in cells of pancreatic endocrine origin. If the structural homologies between Isl-1 and the C. elegans gene products reflect functional similarities, a role for Isl-1 in the development of pancreatic endocrine cells could be envisaged.\r"

Supernatants from HIV-1-infected T cells carrying the CD4 antigen promote the growth of cells derived from KS lesions of AIDS patients (AIDS-KS cells), and the HIV-1 tat gene, introduced into the germ line of mice, induces skin lesions closely resembling KS. Here we report that the tat gene product (Tat) is released from both HIV-1-acutely infected H9 cells and tat-transfected COS-1 cells. These Tat-containing supernatants specifically promote growth of AIDS-KS cells which are inhibited by anti-Tat antibodies; recombinant Tat has the same growth-promoting properties. Therefore a viral regulatory gene product can be released as a biologically active protein and directly act as a growth stimulator. These and previous data indicate that extracellular Tat could be involved in the development or progression, or both, of KS in HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

The propositus, a 72-year-old man, had pes cavus, peripheral neuropathy, ptosis, parkinsonism, hyperreflexia, orthostatic hypotension, central hypoventilation, and mild dementia. Peripheral electrophysiologic studies showed features of an axonal neuropathy. The electroencephalogram showed intermittent 2 to 4 Hz activity symmetrically in the hemispheres. Several family members in 3 generations had pes cavus, neuropathy, ptosis, parkinsonism, and dementia although not all of the features were consistently present. Survival past the 7th decade was common. Autopsy in 2 affected members revealed the neuropathy to be axonal in type and showed mild to moderate loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and pigmentary loss with gliosis in the substantia nigra. This is a unique, benign, autosomal dominant syndrome which shows complete penetrance, variable expression, and both central and peripheral nervous system involvement.\r"

The duplication is completely contained within the gene, and the duplicated exons are predicted to be \"in frame\" with the rest of the gene. Dystrophin protein is detected in the patient's muscle as a single species of approximately 600 kDa (normal, approximately 400 kDa), indicating that the resulting mutated gene codes for a translatable mRNA of over 100 exons (normal, approximately 70 exons). The patient's mother carries the duplicated gene as determined by both DNA and protein analysis. The described duplication of the dystrophin gene is by far the largest characterized to date. This observation is of significant biologic interest in that, despite the gross alteration of the gene and the encoded protein, the patient has a relatively mild clinical progression compatible with a diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy.\r"

We studied identified rat retinal ganglion cell neurons in vitro, a useful system for the study of excitotoxicity, and compared the protective effects of delayed administration of a competitive antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), and of an uncompetitive antagonist, MK-801, after glutamate-induced injury. We used maximally protective doses of the 2 antagonists. Under these conditions, both antagonists were able to prevent neuronal cell death if they were present within minutes of exposure to an endogenous glutamate-related toxin. In contrast, MK-801, but not APV, protected significantly against NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity when administered 1 to 4 hours after the initial insult. Thus, at least under certain conditions, an uncompetitive NMDA antagonist may offer a distinct advantage over a competitive antagonist when given several hours after a neurologic injury.\r"

  ".W": "Because the internal environment of the body is largely a fluid medium, the preservation of the volume and composition of the body fluids is absolutely vital to circulatory status and the extraordinarily complicated functions of the human body. The fluid compartments do not exist as fixed spaces with identical compositions but rather are in constant interchange with each other and have strikingly different compositions. Methods of movement of solutes and water include diffusion along electrochemical gradients, by hydrostatic pressure, osmotic forces, bulk flow, primary and secondary active transport, capillary blood flow, and oncotic pressure. Complex feedback control mechanisms exist to ensure homeostasis or equilibrium and include participation by the kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, the circulatory system, the endocrine system, and the CNS. The maintenance of extracellular volume is centered around the control of balance of the sodium salts. Multiple afferent (or sensing) and efferent (or effector) mechanisms exist to accomplish this homeostasis. The most important determinants of the osmolality or tonicity of the body fluids is the excretion or retention of water by the kidney, thirst mechanisms, and the intake of water. The serum sodium concentration is the laboratory test most often used clinically to assess tonicity. The pH of the body fluids and the major acid-base buffer systems are also carefully regulated. The lungs are responsible for the elimination of the carbon dioxide produced by cellular metabolism, and the kidneys excrete hydrogen ions and regulate the concentration of bicarbonate in the body fluids. Urinary net acid excretion, the hydrogen ions excreted as titratable acid and ammonium ions minus any bicarbonate, equals the acid added to the ECF from the diet and metabolism plus any fecal losses of alkali.\r"

Except when hypernatremia has developed rapidly, the serum sodium concentration should be corrected slowly with frequent monitoring of serum electrolytes.

Disturbances of calcium occur in many other settings, however, and accurate diagnosis and research conclusions may depend on using the best measurement available. Clinical and investigational use of ionized calcium determinations represent appropriate applications of current proven technology. In the future, clinical calcium manipulation may include modifying specific transmembrane transport processes and intracellular calcium pools and movements. At the current time we are largely restricted to studies of extracellular calcium concentration and its interactions. Much is known, but Mother Nature still has too many secrets.

On the first day of life, peak systolic, end diastolic, and mean flow velocities in the pericallosal, internal carotid, and basilar arteries and mean arterial blood pressures were significantly greater in infants who had been exposed to cocaine. On day 2, cerebral blood flow velocities and mean arterial blood pressures were similar in exposed and nonexposed infants. The increase in mean arterial blood pressure and in cerebral blood flow velocity on the first day of life indicates a hemodynamic effect of cocaine that may put the infant exposed to cocaine at a greater risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1986 and 1988, 16 children were treated for 10 arteriovenous malformations and 6 recurrent intracranial tumors with stereotactic radiation therapy using a modified Clinac 6/100 linear accelerator. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years. For the group with arteriovenous malformation, follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (median was 20 months). No patient bled during the follow-up period. Five of eight patients with follow-up longer than 12 months have achieved complete obliteration of their arteriovenous malformation by angiogram. The four remaining patients who have not achieved a complete obliteration are awaiting their 2-year posttreatment angiogram. The other patient has been treated within the year and have not yet been studied. Five of the six recurrent tumor patients are alive with a median follow-up of 8 months. The remaining patient was controlled locally, but he died of recurrent disease outside the area treated with radiosurgery. The radiographic responses of these patients have included three complete responses, two substantial reductions in tumor volume (greater than 50%) and one stabilization. Despite previous radiotherapy, there have been no significant complications in these patients. We conclude that stereotactic radiation therapy using a standard linear accelerator is an effective and safe technique in the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations and tumors in children. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery may have unique applications in the treatment of localized primary and recurrent pediatric brain tumors.\r"

  ".W": "This article is an examination of the nature and extent of the problem presented by medically uninsured children in the United States. First, the characteristics of the uninsured population are explored with a description of how age, family income, and employment status disproportionately affect families with children. Second, the Medicaid program and its historically inadequate response to this growing problem of uninsured children is examined. Third, the relationship between insurance status and the health and development of children is discussed. Finally, recent public policy initiatives that have been enacted or proposed to address this inequity in the present health care system are reviewed with a recommendation to establish a \"Universal Maternal and Child Health Program.\"\r"

An aminoglycoside and an antipseudomonal penicillin were used in five patients, four of whom were cured. The presentation, radiographic studies, therapy, outcome, and period of follow-up in the 20 patients are reported. The previously reported cases of MEO are also reviewed, with a focus on the changing therapy and prognosis. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, cranial nerve deficits, and treatment failures in MEO have all declined significantly since 1985 from frequencies in earlier years. We conclude that there has been an overall improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of MEO and that monotherapy with ceftazidime shows promise against this potentially fatal pseudomonal infection.\r"

The earliest explicit statement of what ought to be done goes back only to 1847, when the American Medical Association was founded. However, this statement conflicts with a 75-year-old assertion that physicians have a right to choose whom they will serve. The conflict is compounded by the suspicion that both stated principles were based, at least in part, on socioeconomic considerations rather than moral imperatives. Of what physicians have actually done over the last 2,400 years, little more can definitely be said than that many have not tried to escape mortal risk while others have done so. Thus it is difficult to employ history as a basis for claiming that physicians have an obligation to treat AIDS.\r"

Patients with HIV infection share several clinical and serologic features with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome; these similarities may lead to diagnostic confusion. The significance of the presence of different types of autoantibodies in HIV-infected patients is still uncertain and may reflect polyclonal B cell activation. Musculoskeletal complications--particularly arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia--are common in advanced stages of HIV infection. Clinical characteristics and serologic findings support the premise that most of the musculoskeletal complications (e.g., Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated arthritis and arthralgias) are reactive in nature--either a direct consequence of HIV infection or a result of various opportunistic infections. The possibility of HIV infection should be considered in all patients with conditions suggesting reactive arthritis. Further studies are needed to define the full spectrum and frequency of these musculoskeletal abnormalities.\r"

Because many adverse reactions to antibiotics are not dependent on renal function, we have attempted to review only those reactions that are believed to be associated with renal insufficiency or that have been reported in patients with impaired renal function. Adverse effects of antibiotics in this setting can be divided into six major categories: neurologic toxicity, coagulopathy, nephrotoxicity, hypoglycemia, hematologic toxicity, and aminoglycoside inactivation by penicillins. Neurologic toxicity can be further divided into central nervous system toxicity consisting primarily of encephalopathy and seizures, ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and neuromuscular blockade/respiratory depression. We explore the factors in uremia that may contribute to the susceptibility of patients with renal insufficiency to the adverse effects of antibiotics. Moreover, we make general recommendations regarding the use of the discussed antibiotics in patients with compromised renal function.\r"

Twenty-nine different DNA types, in two broad classes, have thus far been demonstrated in 91 isolates. One type, IA2, was easily the most common (41% of isolates). A type is constant after multiple generations in vivo, as demonstrated in a mouse model. Isolates from individual medical centers were polymorphic, and DNA types were widely distributed geographically. Persons colonized with and/or having disease due to C. albicans at two or more body sites almost always had the same individual type. Sex partners studied had the same type in genital isolates. There was neither tight concordance nor random association of DNA type with previously described phenotypic groups. Likewise, some phenotypic characteristics were significantly associated with DNA type. Urogenital isolates were significantly associated with DNA type IA2. Colonizing and invading isolates included many different and overlapping DNA types. A cluster of cases in a hospital, previously reported to have been caused by a single organism (based on phenotypic studies), was shown to be due to multiple types. Phenotype switching, associated with transition from colonization to invasion, is suggested in these studies. The present series of studies demonstrates the application of DNA typing methods to classification and clinical problems.\r"

We reviewed the literature on serotypic distribution of pneumococcal infection. Percentage of disease-causing serotypes covered by the 14-valent vaccine varied significantly from one study to another. Differences in age, hospital type, and source of isolation showed statistically significant serotypic distribution.\r"

The mean age of patients who had GBS meningitis outside the perinatal setting was 55 years, and most of these individuals had associated illnesses or frank immunosuppression; the mortality rate in this group was 23%. In contrast, all five patients with maternal GBS meningitis recovered. The case presented herein, like the four previous cases, illustrates the point that when patients with maternal GBS meningitis are treated immediately and have been healthy before the infection, the prognosis is good.\r"

A case report is presented of a patient with IM who developed acute appendicitis during the acute phase of the illness. The appendicitis progressed to the formation of an abscess, which was evacuated at surgery. Histologic examination of the appendix showed absence of lymphoid follicles in the mucosal layer and intense lymphoid infiltration of the mucosa and submucosa by a mixed diffuse proliferation of lymphoid cells with groups of immunoblasts scattered among them. The lymphoid infiltrate was mainly composed of T lymphocytes; the anticomplementary immunofluorescent staining of the appendix for EBNA (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen) was negative. Three cases of appendicitis complicating IM published in the literature are reviewed. All had clinical and histopathologic features similar to those of our patient and were cured after surgery. Our case report together with the literature review confirms that appendicitis in the acute phase of IM has distinct clinical and histopathologic features and thus has to be considered a true complication of IM rather than merely a simultaneous disease.\r"

This paper discusses the clinical uses of amphotericin B, including its application in AIDS-related fungal infections, in neutropenic cancer patients who are persistently febrile, and in infections of the central nervous system, lung, peritoneum, genitourinary system, eye, and skin.

Hepatomegaly and hepatic tenderness were present in all patients; fever occurred in 75%. The diagnosis was strongly suggested by amebic antibodies in high titer and hepatic abscesses demonstrated by sonography. Mean abscess diameter was 9.2 cm; 37% were larger than 10 cm. Most abscesses were solitary (81%), in the right lobe (73%), rounded or oval (78%), cystic (57%), and had a well-defined wall (53%). However, 43% were initially solid or heterogeneous. The latter lesions always developed a cystic pattern when ultrasonography was repeated. The diagnosis was confirmed by a good clinical response to metronidazole in 50 patients. Complications included right-sided pleural effusions or empyema (13%), ascites (13%), and jaundice (13%). Drainage of large abscesses was performed in four patients.

The program began in 1978, and azole derivatives were chosen as a starting point because they were generally well tolerated and offered the advantage of a selective mode of action--inhibition of fungal sterol C-14 demethylation. Initial investigations focused on imidazole derivatives, but attention soon switched to triazole analogues because of their reduced susceptibility to metabolic activity. Polar derivatives were emphasized in an effort to facilitate the attainment of high levels in the blood and to reduce metabolic breakdown still further. This strategy resulted in a number of novel 1,3-bis-triazole-2-arylpropan-2-ol derivatives with good activity in a range of models of fungal infection. These models included systemic fungal infections in both normal and immunosuppressed animals and superficial infections in animals with normal immune function. The 2,4-difluorophenyl analogue, fluconazole, was chosen for development on the basis of an optimal combination of antifungal efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics, aqueous solubility, and safety profile.\r"

These findings corroborate a relation between in vitro and in vivo results. With further work it should be possible to define standard methods for use by clinical laboratories in determining fungal susceptibility to fluconazole.\r"

In contrast, other systemic azoles are lipophilic, metabolically vulnerable compounds with high protein binding and negligible solubility in water. The physical and pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs plus their inherent antifungal potency determine their efficacy. Although fluconazole is less active than ketoconazole in vitro, its distribution throughout the body and the high levels of free drug reached in the blood contribute to and are of value in predicting its efficacy. Even for ketoconazole the levels of free drug in blood may be indicative of efficacy. For very lipophilic agents (itraconazole), blood levels of drug are very low, and organ levels may correlate better with efficacy, although tissue binding will be high and total drug levels in an organ may be misleading indicators of efficacy. The excellent efficacy of fluconazole in vivo despite its low activity in vitro has caused confusion. Consequently, a disk test is being developed to assess whether fungal isolates are sensitive to therapeutically achievable levels of drug.\r"

Fluconazole reduced the tissue burden of Aspergillus from that in untreated controls by 10- to 100-fold in liver, kidney, and lung. However, at these doses amphotericin B was more effective in sterilizing tissues and in reducing the tissue burden of Aspergillus in those organs. Both fluconazole and amphotericin B decreased or eliminated circulating Aspergillus antigen and improved survival over that of untreated controls. Thus fluconazole shows activity in this rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis and should be further evaluated for use in the treatment of this disease.\r"

It has been examined in several animal models emphasizing important clinical sites of infection with common yeast pathogens. The drug has an excellent pharmacokinetic profile for central nervous system, renal, and ocular infections; at these sites fluconazole has been successful in the treatment of infections with Cryptococcus neoformans or Candida albicans. On the basis of the experience in animals, fluconazole should be critically evaluated in the treatment of human mycoses such as cryptococcosis of the central nervous system and renal/ocular candidiasis. This agent represents the new wave of interest in the increasingly troublesome problem of deep-seated fungal infections.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the potential for the use of fluconazole for prevention and treatment of disseminated candidiasis in granulocytopenic patients, we investigated its activity and pharmacokinetics in models of acute, subacute, and chronic forms of disseminated candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits. Fluconazole was administered for systemic prophylaxis, early treatment, and delayed treatment. Single-dose and steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, and dose-response studies of the investigational compound were studied in subacutely infected granulocytopenic rabbits. Fluconazole was more effective when used for systemic prophylaxis or early treatment of disseminated candidiasis than for delayed treatment. Fluconazole was as effective as amphotericin B plus flucytosine in preventive and early treatment of disseminated candidiasis but was significantly less effective than amphotericin plus flucytosine in the treatment of chronic candidiasis. Dose-response studies demonstrated that the antifungal effect of fluconazole was dose- and time-dependent. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in rabbits demonstrated a long half-life in plasma and a large volume of distribution, properties that correspond to the attainment of high levels of penetration into tissues at multiple organ sites. We conclude that fluconazole is effective for prevention and early treatment of disseminated candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits and that the evaluation of its use in preventive or early treatment of disseminated candidiasis in carefully designed clinical trials is warranted.\r"

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are similar following intravenous and oral dosing. Oral bioavailability is greater than 90%, and concentrations peak approximately 2 hours after dosing. The apparent volume of distribution is 0.7 L/kg, and plasma protein binding is low (12%). The drug is metabolically stable, with renal excretion accounting for approximately 80% of the elimination as unchanged drug. Repeated once-daily dosing results in an increase in plasma levels of approximately 2.5-fold, with steady state achieved by day 7. Plasma levels are dose-proportional, and the elimination rate remains constant across the dosage range and over time. The plasma half-life of fluconazole is approximately 30 hours. The pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy young adults and in the elderly, but dose modification is required in patients with renal impairment. Fluconazole diffuses readily into the cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, and saliva and is concentrated in the urine and skin.\r"

In two studies of chronic atrophic candidiasis associated with dentures, 82 patients received 7 or 14 days of therapy with fluconazole (50 mg daily). Clinical and mycologic cure rates ranged from 69% to 100%, with the best results occurring with 14 days of therapy in combination with the cleansing of dentures. Thirteen patients with oroesophageal candidiasis associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis were treated with 50 or 200 mg of fluconazole daily, and clinical and mycologic remissions were achieved in a mean period of 10 days. So far 95 patients have been treated with fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis associated with malignancy, therapeutic immunosuppression, AIDS, or AIDS-related complex. Infection was cured by clinical criteria in 84% of those studied. While the majority of patients with clinical cure had significant reductions in the number of yeast colonies, only 48% had negative oral cultures at the end of therapy with courses of 50 mg of fluconazole daily for 5 days to 8 weeks.\r"

Cryptococcal meningitis is an important cause of central nervous system disease and death in patients with AIDS. Although the introduction of amphotericin B has greatly improved the prognosis of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 30 years of experience have revealed important clinical limitations, including modest efficacy, nephrotoxicity, other clinically significant toxicities, and the inconvenience of intravenous dosing. The discovery of the additive effects of amphotericin B and flucytosine in cryptococcosis resulted in some improvement in efficacy and reduction in amphotericin B-related toxicity. However, approximately 30% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis still fail to respond to therapy. Ketoconazole has not proved useful in treating cryptococcal meningitis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the antifungal triazoles fluconazole, itraconazole, and SCH 39304 represent an advance in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in AIDS patients. Preliminary clinical trials in patients with and without AIDS have indicated that fluconazole and intraconazole are effective and well tolerated as either initial or maintenance therapy. Two large comparative trials of fluconazole and amphotericin B in patients with cryptococcal meningitis (mostly those with AIDS) are under way.\r"

Topical therapy is usually poorly tolerated; ketoconazole is effective but absorption is highly variable. New antifungal agents have been developed to increase the therapeutic options. Fluconazole is active against yeasts, is available in both oral and intravenous formulations, and has a pharmacokinetic profile different from that of ketoconazole. This randomized double-blind study evaluates systemic antifungal therapy with fluconazole (100 mg daily) or ketoconazole (400-mg daily) for oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with cancer. Clinical cure was observed in 15 of 19 and 14 of 18 patients treated with fluconazole and ketoconazole, respectively. Eradication of pathogenic yeasts ws documented for 10 patients in both groups. The rates of relapse were similar, but relapse occurred earlier in patients in the ketoconazole group. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of a dosage of 100 mg of fluconazole or of 400 mg of ketoconazole daily for the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with cancer.\r"

Prolonged neutropenia is the major factor predisposing patients to invasive fungal disease. Candida and Aspergillus species remain the two most common pathogens. Prophylaxis against these organisms with the oral polyenes nystatin and amphotericin B has been disappointing. Systemic amphotericin B is too toxic for prophylactic use, yet it remains the mainstay of therapy for suspected or established deep fungal infection. Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients receiving cyclosporine prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease and appears effective only in high doses associated relatively commonly with adverse reactions. This paper reviews results of antifungal prophylaxis and discusses new measures and agents likely to be of value in the prevention of fungal infection in bone marrow transplantation.\r"

When this transcription unit is injected into rabbit kidney cells expressing Escherichia coli lac repressor, T-antigen expression is reduced. This effect is not observed in cells lacking repressor or in the absence of the operator, and it is reversed by an inducer of the lac operon, namely isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG). In an extract of HeLa nuclei supplemented with lac repressor, this and similar constructs give rise to shortened transcripts that map to the 5' boundary of the repressor-operator complex. These shorter RNAs are also sensitive to IPTG induction. This model system shows that a protein-DNA complex can block the passage of RNA polymerase II, and offers some insight into the control of eukaryotic gene expression during transcription elongation, a phenomenon observed in a variety of systems.\r"

Four normal brain tissue samples without neoplastic cells, which were obtained at surgery, were also examined for nucleolar organizer region staining. Both the mean number of nucleolar organizer regions and the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells well reflected the histological grade of gliomas (astrocytoma grade 2: Ki-67, 0.5% and nucleolar organizer regions, 1.6; astrocytoma grade 3: Ki-67, 3% and nucleolar organizer regions, 2.5; astrocytoma grade 4: Ki-67, 5.2% and nucleolar organizer regions, 2.8). Also, the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells and the mean number of nucleolar organizer regions were found to be linearly related (r = 0.91). Both values of high-grade astrocytomas were significantly greater than those of low-grade astrocytomas (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001). Thus, the mean number of nucleolar organizer regions as well as Ki-67 labeling index reflect the proliferating potential of gliomas.\r"

During an episode of increased demand for myocardial oxygen, this collateral blood supply may become insufficient, and symptoms of myocardial ischemia may arise. PTCA of the occluded vessel appears to be an attractive approach to relieve ischemia in this situation. The primary success of dilatation of totally occluded segments depends largely on the duration of the occlusion but also on anatomic factors such as total or functional occlusion, the length of the occluded segment, and good angiographic visualization of the coronary artery distal to the occlusion by collaterals. The primary success rate (+/- 60%) of PTCA of occluded vessels is lower than the success rate (greater than 90%) of PTCA of nonocclusive stenoses. Also the restenosis rate (+/- 40%) and subsequent recurrence rate of angina pectoris is higher, compared to the 30% restenosis rate after dilatation of conventional lesions. Newer percutaneous techniques such as lasers, newly designed guide wires, and intravascular imaging devices are necessary to increase the primary success rate. Whether these techniques will also improve the long-term results remains uncertain.\r"

To determine the mechanism of action of nifedipine and its dose-response relation, 14 patients with stable angina were treated with nifedipine 10, 20 and 30 mg 4 times daily as single-agent therapy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Treatment was continued for 1 week on each dose regimen and efficacy was determined using an exercise test at the end of each phase. Compared to placebo, a significant decrease of systolic blood pressure at peak exercise occurred with the nifedipine 20- and 30-mg regimens (p less than 0.05), accompanied by an increase in heart rate on the 10- and 20-mg regimens (p less than 0.005). There was no significant effect on the rate-pressure product compared to placebo at any exercise time on any of the nifedipine regimens. The times to onset of ST-segment depression and to angina were delayed significantly by all 3 dose regimens compared to placebo (p less than 0.02). There was a significant decrease in the magnitude of ST-segment depression at all exercise times by all dosage schedules of nifedipine compared with placebo (p less than 0.05), although there were no significant differences among the 3 dosage schedules. Data indicate that since nifedipine was effective in improving manifestations of myocardial ischemia during exercise without altering the double product at submaximal or maximal exercise, its beneficial mechanism of action may have been due to enhancing blood flow to ischemic zones or to favorably altering determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, which were not measured.\r"

Indapamide reduces intracellular calcium levels, maintains magnesium ions, but reduces phosphate ions that may be involved in arterial rigidity. Circulating catecholamines remain unchanged but there is a reduction in normetanephrine, suggesting a reduction in sympathetic tone. It stimulates prostacyclin synthesis, increases levels of circulating prostacyclin, reduces platelet aggregation and stimulates the vasodilation elicited by endothelium-derived relaxing factor in the presence of bradykinin. In addition, it inhibits the formation of the vasoconstrictor prostanoid, thromboxane A2. The free radical scavenging activity of indapamide could also protect the vascular smooth muscle from the reperfusion injury of cerebral and myocardial ischemia. Indapamide induces a reduction in cerebral ischemia after carotid ligation. Unlike some other antihypertensives, it does not upset the high-density/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol balance, reducing the possible risk of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the combination of binding to elastin and reduction in uptake of calcium and phosphate into the smooth muscle could be a mechanism for reducing arterial rigidity seen in the elderly and hypertensive patient. In hypertensive patients, these properties induce an improvement in arterial compliance, and in the long term a reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy. These pharmacologic and clinical results, together with a good antihypertensive efficacy and acceptability, suggest that indapamide may be a preferential agent in the long-term cardiovascular protection of the hypertensive patient.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications has been clearly demonstrated in the last 20 years. Antihypertensives are particularly useful in the reduction of cerebrovascular complications which decrease by 60% on average in clinical trials on the treatment of mild and severe hypertension. After the first clinical trials, the 1978 World Health Organization Experts Committee recommended the classic stepped-care (SC) approach with diuretics and beta blockers as first-step agents. Other antihypertensive drugs, such as reserpine, centrally acting agents and vasodilators could be used in the next steps if blood pressure control was not achieved. Both diuretics and beta blockers have been widely used and the SC regimen has contributed to the better control of arterial hypertension in the community. The SC regimen has given general practitioners easy guidelines with which to treat hypertensive patients. There are many reasons for modifying the classic SC approach. Prescription of antihypertensive drugs at high doses should be avoided and the use of new agents, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, is recommended. Demographic trends have brought about an increase in the aged population and, consequently, an increase in the proportion of elderly hypertensives. These patients present particular problems in long-term management, among which are a high frequency of other associated diseases and an important number of adverse effects caused by the classic antihypertensive drugs. Nevertheless, diuretics are still useful in the treatment of hypertension, either as a monotherapy regimen or in association with other drugs. New diuretics, such as indapamide, have a very interesting pharmacologic profile with considerably fewer metabolic side effects on plasma cholesterol and glucose levels.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertensive patients are at an increased risk of developing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Treatment has resulted in a substantial reduction in cerebrovascular deaths but not in cardiovascular mortality. As the number of deaths from myocardial infarction exceeds the sum of all other hypertension-related mortalities, these results are disappointing. The hypothesis that metabolic side effects of many antihypertensive drugs offset the potential benefit of decreasing blood pressure is of particular interest. In established hypertension there is an increase in total peripheral resistance. Long-term therapy with diuretics decreases vascular resistance. This is also evident with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha blockers. In patients with hypertension, an increased wall to lumen ratio occurs in resistance vessels where mechanisms such as smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased amounts of elastin and collagen are present. In small resistance vessels, long-term antihypertensive therapy has a positive effect, but the effect in large arteries is variable.\r"

  ".W": "There is an increasing awareness of the need to manage multiple risk factors in hypertensive patients, and of possible adverse metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs which may counteract their ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Data collected from the Austin Hospital Hypertension Clinic support previous observations that the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors such as plasma lipid abnormalities are high in hypertensive patients, and although it is becoming easier to control blood pressure in these patients, modification of other risk factors is difficult. The use of diuretics in doses lower than those conventionally prescribed has been advocated as a means of reducing the adverse metabolic effects. However, data from this study suggest that although low-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy (25 to 50 mg/day) may be as effective as conventional doses of captopril in reducing blood pressure, adverse metabolic effects on plasma potassium, glucose and uric acid levels remain a problem. Indapamide, a relatively new diuretic when used at a fixed dose (2.5 mg/day), appears to be devoid of significant adverse metabolic effects and is a useful alternative to thiazide diuretics. An integrated approach to the management of multiple cardiovascular risk factors is important in hypertensive patients and should include non-pharmacologic methods and the selection of antihypertensive drugs that do not have adverse metabolic effects.\r"

  ".W": "One of the main objectives of antihypertensive therapy is to preserve renal function from the deleterious effects of elevated blood pressure. Diuretics alone or in combination are effective for the treatment of arterial hypertension. Nevertheless, their use is accompanied by unwanted biochemical side effects, which have been attributed to their renal effects. During the last 10 years a group of 211 patients, diagnosed as having essential hypertension, were followed up. During the follow-up, they received a stepped-care therapeutic regimen consisting of nonpharmacologic measures (group 1), hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride (group 2), propranolol (group 3) and, if necessary, hydralazine (group 4). During the study, blood pressure remained within comparable, well-controlled levels in the 4 groups of patients. A progressive elevation of the levels of total serum cholesterol and glucose was observed in every group. The elevation attained statistical significance (p less than 0.01) after 4 years of therapy in those groups receiving the diuretic alone or in combination. Nevertheless, after 8 years of follow-up, the increment observed in these 2 parameters did not differ when patients in group 1 were compared with those in the remaining groups, indicating that thiazide diuretics could contribute to the earlier appearance of forthcoming events. Serum potassium levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1. At the same time, we have observed the progressive appearance of clinically relevant proteinuria in 15.2% of patients, and the range of protein excretion ranged from 350 to 3,700 mg/24 hours. The appearance of proteinuria did not depend on the lack of control of blood pressure, nor on the different therapeutic requirements but was accompanied by a progressive decrease in creatinine clearance. The consequences of the renal effects of diuretics are of great importance during long-term therapy. The present results indicate that diuretics preempt the appearance of a forthcoming increase in serum glucose and cholesterol, and lessen the clinical relevance of these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The study of membrane ion transport has facilitated the discovery of potent and quite specific inhibitory drugs. Some of these compounds are therapeutic agents acting on basic transport mechanisms as in the case of the cardiac glycosides on the myocardial sodium ion (Na+), potassium ion (K+) pump, and the loop diuretics on the renal Na+, K+, chloride (Cl-) co-transport system. The development of inhibitors for other transport systems such as Na+/hydrogen ion (H+), Na+/calcium ion (Ca2+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-)/Cl- exchangers requires the screening of a large number of molecules. For several reasons, the human red blood cell is one of the best models for screening the effect of drugs on ion transport mechanisms. The use of human red cells for pharmacologic studies of ion transport has increased the understanding of the structure-activity relations of diuretics. For instance, loop diuretics that are chemically neutral were considered for many years as drugs that act similarly to classic acid loop diuretics. They are now considered as potent inhibitors of HCO3-/Cl- anion exchange. A brief summary of the more recent results is given together with the perspectives of new fundamental and therapeutic applications of these compounds.\r"

Four centers participated in the study, which included patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was between 95 and 115 mmHg with no treatment (group I, n = 40), those taking captopril (group II, n = 40) or those taking propranolol (group III, n = 40). After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients received indapamide either alone (group I) or in combination with the previous therapy (groups II and III) for 4 months. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and clinical and biochemical acceptability were measured before and after 2 and 4 months of treatment. At the same time points, quality of life was determined using standardized questionnaires completed by the patient (20 items) and the physician (10 items) and a visual analog scale completed by the patient. In all groups, administration of indapamide induced a clinically and statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the supine position after 2 months. Indapamide alone controlled blood pressure in 82% of the patients previously untreated, and indapamide in combined therapy controlled blood pressure, respectively, in 67 and 85% of patients previously uncontrolled with ACE inhibitors or beta blockers. In all groups, questionnaires on quality of life showed a progressive and significant improvement in general well-being. After 4 months of treatment, the percentage of improvement in the physician questionnaire was 77.1% in group I, 60.6% in group II and 71.4% in group III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol and serum triglycerides were unchanged, and uric acid increased significantly (from 292.0 +/- 6.5 to 377.7 +/- 56.5 mumols/liter). A mild reduction in serum potassium (-0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol/liter) was observed after 2 and 6 months of therapy; however, the degree of reduction appeared to be lower than that from reported studies with other thiazide diuretics. The incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/liter) was highest in northern Italy (17%), intermediate in the central region (14%) and lowest in southern Italy (2%), although the absolute reduction in serum potassium was similar in all the geographic areas. Blood glucose tolerance was unchanged despite the changes in serum potassium. The tolerability was good on the whole, with a tendency toward an improvement in the well-being of patients, most of whom were already asymptomatic before starting the study.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretics are still among the most frequently used antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Their pharmacologic and hemodynamic properties are based on the water and salt metabolism in the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. Initially, there is a reduction of plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases. After this early phase, cardiac output returns to normal with an accompanying decrease in peripheral resistance so as to correct the underlying hemodynamic fault of the hypertensive state. Diuretics have a high therapeutic efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists. The main problem with the use of diuretics is related to their metabolic side effects, which are dose-related. Currently, there is a tendency to administer low-dose diuretics, which result in fewer clinical and metabolic side effects, but with a continued antihypertensive efficacy. Therefore, low doses of diuretics can be recommended as initial therapy in the stepped-care approach of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Among the numerous risk factors for atherosclerosis, 2 are particularly important: hypertension and primary or secondary abnormalities of plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Antihypertensive treatments significantly decrease the risk of cerebrovascular accidents, renal failure or hypertensive cardiomyopathy, but they have little influence on coronary artery disease. It has been suggested that some antihypertensive agents may have deleterious effects by altering serum lipoproteins and this may override the benefit of blood pressure reduction. Diuretics increase the blood concentration of total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. Indapamide, a methylindoline agent with vasodilator activity, has no adverse lipid effects. Twenty-six studies have clearly demonstrated that indapamide appears to be unique among diuretics because of an absence of adverse lipid effects. In some studies indapamide significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apoproteins A1, A2 and apoprotein E. When a thiazide diuretic had been given previously, indapamide treatment normalized the lipid and lipoprotein profiles. The reason for the lack of adverse lipid effects of indapamide is discussed. Thus indapamide, 2.5 mg once daily, is effective and safe for the control of mild to moderate hypertension, both in young and older patients. It may be an optimal diuretic for use in normolipidemic or hyperlipidemic patients, as it increases high-density lipoprotein but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\r"

Sixteen adolescents and young adults with phenylketonuria participated in double-blind trials in which a valine, isoleucine, and leucine mixture or a control mixture was given for four 3-month periods. Biochemical and neuropsychologic tests were carried out before and at the end of each period. Time to completion of a test that required substantial attention with mental processing (Attention Diagnostic Method) was faster during the valine, isoleucine, and leucine periods than during the control mixture periods. Improvement with valine, isoleucine, and leucine on a less demanding task (Continuous Performance Test) approached significance. These data lent support to the hypothesis that a regimen of valine, isoleucine, and leucine may help individuals unable to maintain low serum phenylalanine levels.\r"

The 15 100% baboons were ventilated for a mean of 139 hours, while the 15 prn baboons were ventilated for a mean of 151 hours. The findings in all conventional and oscillator-ventilated animals were similar and characterized by squamous metaplasia, cilia loss, and goblet cell loss.

  ".U": "90233444\r", 
  ".W": "Parasitological and entomological parameters of malaria transmission were monitored for 17 months in 3,625 residents in a Plasmodium vivax malaria endemic region in southern Sri Lanka; the study area consisted of 7 contiguous villages where routine national malaria control operations were being conducted. Malaria was monitored in every resident; fever patients were screened and 4 periodical mass blood surveys were conducted. An annual malaria incidence rate of 23.1% was reported during the period: 9.3% was due to P. vivax and 13.8% was due to P. falciparum; there had been a recent epidemic of the latter in this region, whereas the P. falciparum incidence rate in the previous 10 years had been negligible. There was a wide seasonal fluctuation in the malaria incidence, with the peak incidence closely following the monsoon rains. The prevalence of malaria due to both species detected at the 4 mass blood surveys ranged from 0.98% (at low transmission) to 2.35% (at peak transmission periods). Adults and children developed acute clinical manifestations of malaria. Entomological measurements confirmed a low degree of endemicity with estimated inoculation rates of 0.0029 and 0.0109 (infectious bites/man/night) for P. vivax and P. falciparum, respectively. Several anopheline species contributed to the transmission, and the overall man biting rates (MBR) showed a marked seasonal variation. Malaria at Kataragama, typical of endemic areas of Sri Lanka, thus presents characteristics of \"unstable\" transmission. Malaria was clustered in the population. There was a low clinical tolerance to P. falciparum malaria, to which most had only been at risk, compared to P. vivax, to which most had had a life-long exposure.\r"

Mice were challenged with 100, 1,000, or 10,000 sporozoites, then evaluated daily beginning on day 4 for patency. CD-1 mice were further evaluated at challenge doses of 12,500, 25,000, and 50,000 sporozoites. C57BL/6 mice were the easiest to infect, with 90% becoming infected with 100 sporozoites. The outbred strain CD-1 was the most difficult to infect, requiring a challenge dose of 25,000 sporozoites/mouse in order to achieve a 100% infection rate. Mouse strains also demonstrated differences in their ability to be protected by intravenous immunization with gamma-irradiated sporozoites. A/J mice needed a minimum of 3 doses of irradiated sporozoites for protection against a challenge with 10,000 sporozoites. In contrast, BALB/c mice immunized with a single dose of 1,000 irradiated sporozoites are protected against a 10,000 sporozoite challenge. These data suggest that both infectivity and protection are genetically restricted and that susceptibility to infection may be inversely related to protection.\r"

The TMB-ELISA was evaluated using sporozoites from experimentally infected mosquitoes and laboratory colonized uninfected mosquitoes. Our data indicate comparable sensitivity levels between the TMB-ELISA and the standard ELISA, i.e., 50 P. falciparum or P. vivax sporozoites/50 microliters of test solution. Reactions inherent to the method were specific and background reactivity was minimal. The TMB-ELISA is rapid (1 hr), simple, uses a minimal amount of monoclonal antibodies, and is suitable for use in a wide range of laboratories.\r"

During October-December, 22 isolations of SF virus were made from serum samples collected from patients in Bangui presenting with fever, severe persistent headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and a convalescence marked by asthenia. During the same period, 8 SF virus isolates were obtained from mosquitoes collected in Bangui, mainly from Ae. aegypti. Europeans, particularly soldiers who had recently arrived from France, were affected. Antibodies to alphaviruses had been previously detected in a high proportion of resident human populations in CAR. We conclude that SF virus is a human pathogen.\r"

Forty-five research reports of clinical trials for the prevention of myalgias after succinylcholine were assembled. Four classes of preventive drugs (nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, succinylcholine in \"self-taming\" doses, and local anesthetics) were reported in detail sufficient to allow for inclusion in a meta-analysis of clinical efficacy. Each study was summarized by determining the difference in the incidence of myalgias on the first postoperative day between treatment and control groups. A random-effects variance components approach was used. Seven meta-analyses were performed (atracurium, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, pancuronium, diazepam, succinylcholine in self-taming doses, and lidocaine). For each meta-analysis there was statistically significant heterogeneity among studies. Atracurium, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, pancuronium, diazepam, and lidocaine all significantly decreased the frequency of myalgias by about 30%. Succinylcholine in self-taming doses alone was not efficacious.\r"

TAC (0.5% tetracaine, 1:2,000 adrenalin, 11.8% cocaine) is a topically applied anesthetic. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study was conducted to test the hypothesis that topical TAC and intradermal lidocaine are equally efficacious with respect to patient compliance with the suturing process, ie, anesthetic application and placement of sutures, and development of wound complications. Patients less than 18 years old, with lacerations 5 cm or less in length, located in well vascularized, nonmucous membrane areas were included. Patients were entered into the intradermal or topical groups; the intradermal group received lidocaine and the topical group was randomized to receive either TAC or placebo. One hundred fifty-one patients were enrolled in the study. There was no significant difference in the rates of successful initial anesthesia with TAC (89%) and lidocaine (79%). TAC was significantly better (P less than .002) with regard to patient compliance with the suturing process than lidocaine or placebo. Seventeen percent of patients who received placebo had initial anesthesia. These results suggest that TAC, when applied correctly, may be the preferred anesthetic for laceration repair in children.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of TAC on a urine drug test for cocaine. On the morning after the use of TAC, 14 of 18 patients (78%) studied had positive screening tests for benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) by the enzyme multiplied immunoassay test (EMIT) method. All specimens also were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, the reference standard for analysis of drugs of abuse in urine, and 15 of the specimens (83%) were positive. Four of 18 positive specimens (22%) still had positive EMIT drug screens on the morning of the next day, an average of 36 hours after use of TAC. We recommend that physicians who use TAC solution as a local anesthetic caution their patients that they may fail a urine drug screen for cocaine if they are tested within 36 to 48 hours of the administration of the use of TAC.\r"

The entire course, including the tutorial floppy disks, was contained in one loose-leaf notebook. Residents who took the course were surveyed. The course took an average of three to six hours to complete. All found the course to be helpful, with word processing being the most useful module. The majority of residents thought that the course was so valuable that it should be given earlier in the residency. Thus, we have moved the course to the first postgraduate year, and the data base and spread-sheet modules have been made optional.

DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with subject stratification by pretreatment CD4 T lymphocyte counts. SETTING: Multicenter trial at AIDS Clinical Trial units. SUBJECTS: Seven hundred eleven subjects with mildly symptomatic HIV infection. INTERVENTION: Three hundred fifty-one subjects were assigned to placebo and 360 to zidovudine, 200 mg orally every 4 hours. The median duration of follow-up was 11 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-one subjects developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), advanced AIDS-related complex, or death as a first critical event. For the stratum of subjects with more than 200 but less than 500 CD4 T lymphocytes/mm3 before treatment, 34 events occurred in placebo recipients and 12 in zidovudine recipients (P = 0.0002; relative risk [RR] estimate, 3.23 [95% CI, 1.67 to 6.24]). For the stratum of subjects with 500 to 799 CD4 T lymphocytes/mm3 before treatment, 2 events occurred in placebo recipients and 3 in zidovudine recipients. Candidiasis at study entry independently increased the risk for having an event (P = 0.005; RR estimate, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.29 to 4.12]); HIV antigenemia at study entry also increased this risk (P = 0.01; RR estimate, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.8]). Significant differences between the treatment groups in CD4 T-lymphocyte counts occurred in subjects with more than 200 but less than 500 CD4 T lymphocytes/mm3 after 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.002). Differences persisted through week 52. Less prominent changes occurred in subjects with 500 or more CD4 T lymphocytes/mm3. Serum levels of HIV antigen decreased significantly in zidovudine recipients. Serious anemia and neutropenia occurred in 5% and 4% of zidovudine recipients, respectively, and in 0% and 1% of placebo recipients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Zidovudine delayed progression of HIV disease and produced little toxicity in subjects with mildly symptomatic HIV disease and less than 500 CD4 T lymphocytes/mm3.\r"

SETTING: A general medicine group practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Continuing-care patients from 40 to 68 years of age. Of 456 eligible women, 156 refused participation, 300 were randomly assigned, 269 completed assigned interventions, and 260 completed the post-test 1 year later. INTERVENTIONS: One third of patients received nurse instruction stressing tactile skills (Mammacare group) (Mammatech Corporation, Gainesville, Florida); one third, traditional nurse instruction emphasizing technique (traditional group); and one third, no nurse instruction (control group). Half of each group received physician encouragement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One year later, women in the Mammacare group found more lumps (mean, 57%; 95% CI, 54% to 60%) in manufactured breast models than did those in the traditional (mean, 47%; CI, 44% to 51%) and control (mean, 45%; CI, 42% to 48%) groups. Lump detection specificity was unaffected. Self-reported examination frequency rose in all groups, to 5.1 times per 6 months in the traditional group, 4.2 in the Mammacare group, and 3.9 in the control group. Physician encouragement did not improve sensitivity, specificity, or overall frequency. Women in the Mammacare group used more of seven examination techniques (4.9) than did those in the traditional (3.9) or control (3.2) groups (P less than 0.001). No group increased health care use or reported more overall worry about breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Mammacare instruction resulted in more long-term improved lump detection and examination technique use than did traditional instruction or physician encouragement. Breast self-examination instruction should emphasize lump detection skills.\r"

Recent data indicate that high total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels predict risk for coronary heart disease in patients over 60 years of age. However, selecting appropriate candidates for cholesterol-lowering therapy requires clinical judgment of the relative risks and benefits of each therapy and consideration of each patient's overall health status as well as of competing risks. Active medical management of high cholesterol levels, therefore, should be restricted to a limited fraction of elderly patients who are most likely to benefit from long-term therapy. The first line of treatment is diet modification; however, drug therapy for appropriate patients is not contraindicated because of age alone.\r"

From a screened population of 1024 subjects, we randomized 66 predominantly female subjects to two intervention groups: diet counseling and diet counseling with exercise. Subjects were selected who had elevated levels of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, an average or low fitness level, and a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol. After 26 weeks of intervention, 51 subjects exhibited significant decreases in serum levels of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The addition of exercise to diet counseling resulted in improved aerobic capacity, losses of body fat and weight, and further nonsignificant decreases in serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Since these results differ from data acquired in individuals with normal to borderline serum cholesterol levels, further studies appear indicated in hypercholesterolemic subjects, especially in women.\r"

We compared physician recognition of depression (defined by chart notation or prescription of antidepressants) with diagnoses generated by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) in 265 medical outpatients. Using DIS criteria, diagnoses of major depression in the past year or dysthymia (chronic minor depression) were made in 70 patients. Physicians recognized as depressed only 25 (35.7%) of the 70 DIS-depressed patients. However, 36 patients who were not depressed according to DIS were \"recognized\" as depressed by physicians. Patients misdiagnosed as depressed by physicians were older, less educated, had more outpatient visits, and were prescribed more medications. Receiver operating characteristic curves of two self-report depression scales suggest that these scales may assist physicians in recognizing depressed outpatients. We conclude that physicians underrecognize and misdiagnose depression in medical outpatients.\r"

Nephrocalcinosis and cutaneous calcifications have long been recognized in patients with chronic renal failure, but they have not often been reported in acute hyperparathyroidism or other causes of calcium-phosphate metabolism aberrations. The pathogenesis is not clear, and both the sensitizer and challenging agent in the hypersensitivity theory are often elusive, though hypercalcemia is the most consistent factor. The clinical features vary according to the organs affected and often mimic a gamut of more common conditions. Treatment is primarily supportive, with specific measures only possible when a sensitizer or challenger is identified. Correction of the hypercalcemia is, however, imperative. It is important to recognize this rare condition to avoid the more serious end results often reported.\r"

Following a placebo-washout period, patients received either labetalol (n = 70) or placebo (n = 63), which was titrated as necessary from 100 to 400 mg twice a day over a 6-week period. Once the BP was controlled (standing systolic BP less than 160 mm Hg, and greater than or equal to 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline) or the maximum dosage had been given, patients continued receiving the same regimen until the end of the titration period and throughout a 4-week maintenance period. Blood pressure was controlled in 57 (81%) of 70 of the labetalol-treated patients (86% receiving less than or equal to 200 mg twice a day) compared with 34 (54%) of 63 of the placebo-treated patients. Throughout the active treatment periods, BP was significantly lower in patients treated with labetalol compared with those taking placebo; mean standing systolic BP decreased 26 mm Hg in the labetalol group vs 9 mm Hg in the placebo group. Side effects were generally mild, and the dropout rates due to adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups (14% in the labetalol group vs 10% in the placebo group). In summary, labetalol can effectively lower systolic BP in the elderly without causing adverse orthostatic changes.\r"

We investigated the behavioral effects of rapid tryptophan depletion in patients in antidepressant-induced remission. Twenty-one patients who were depressed by DSM-III-R criteria received a 24-hour, 160-mg/d, low-tryptophan diet followed the next morning by a 16-amino acid drink, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled (acute tryptophan depletion and control testing), crossover fashion. Total and free tryptophan levels decreased 87% and 91%, respectively, during acute tryptophan depletion. Fourteen of the 21 remitted depressed patients receiving antidepressants experienced a depressive relapse after the tryptophan-free amino acid drink, with gradual (24 to 48 hours) return to the remitted state on return to regular food intake. Control testing produced no significant behavioral effects. Free plasma tryptophan level was negatively correlated with depression score during acute tryptophan depletion. The therapeutic effects of some antidepressant drugs may be dependent on serotonin availability.\r"

At baseline, all patients exhibited a rapid cycling pattern and were evaluated prospectively through at least one affective episode. Levothyroxine was added to the baseline medication regimen, and the dosage was increased until clinical response occurred or until side effects precluded further increase. While patients were taking levothyroxine, scores on both depressive and manic symptom rating scales decreased significantly compared with baseline. This improvement was due to the clear-cut response of depressive symptoms in 10 of 11 patients, with manic symptoms responding in five of the seven patients who exhibited them during baseline evaluation. Four patients then underwent single- or double-blind placebo substitution; three patients relapsed into either depression or cycling. Treatment response did not depend on previous thyroid status. In 9 of 10 responsive patients, supranormal circulating levels of free thyroxine were necessary to induce clinical response. Side effects were minimal, and there were no signs or symptoms of levothyroxine-induced hypermetabolism.\r"
