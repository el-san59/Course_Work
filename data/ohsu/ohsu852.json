This was more evident in those who also had a bacterial pathogen. Subsequently, 123 infants and children with acute diarrhea were admitted to a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients received either BSS at a dosage of 100 mg/(kg.d) for 5 days or a placebo. Patients in the two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, weight, height, and baseline disease parameters. Compared with subjects treated with placebo, those who received BSS had significantly lower stool weight sooner; improved stool consistency sooner; shorter hospital stay; lower number of stools; decreased need for intravenous fluids; and better evolution of clinical condition. The maximum mean serum level of salicylate occurred on day 3, and the mean blood level of bismuth on the last day of dosing (day 5) was 5.8 ppb.\r"

The most common etiologic agent, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), has been studied extensively and, because of the importance of this etiology, strategies for prevention and treatment of ETEC diarrhea with antimicrobial agents have been devised. The prevention of travelers' diarrhea by immunization will, to a large extent, depend on the development of vaccines against ETEC. Because the etiologic agents that cause travelers' diarrhea are the same ones (with the exception of rotavirus) that cause acute diarrhea in small children living in the developing world that tourists visit, any advances in prevention and treatment of diarrhea in travelers will be directly applicable to the worldwide problem of diarrhea in children, which is far more important on a global scale.\r"

In the first study, 62 subjects received BSS for 3 weeks at a dosage of 60 mL four times daily (4.2 g of BSS/d) compared with 66 students receiving an oral placebo at a similar dosage schedule. In the second study, 51 students took two tablets four times daily (2.1 g of BSS/d), 63 took one tablet four times daily (1.05 g of BSS/d), and 58 took a placebo (two tablets taken four times daily), each for 3 weeks. In the initial study, 14 (23%) BSS-treated subjects developed diarrhea compared with 40 (61%) placebo-tested persons (P less than .0001). In the second trial, seven (14%) subjects taking two tablets of BSS four times daily, 15 (24%) taking one tablet of BSS four times daily, and 23 (40%) receiving placebo tablets experienced diarrhea (P less than .001 for the higher dose). The percent protection provided by BSS was 62% for the group that received 4.2 g/d, 65% for 2.1 g/d, and 40% for 1.05 g/d, when compared with the corresponding placebo group. In cases in which stools were analyzed, seven (24%) of 29 BSS-treated subjects who had diarrhea had a detectable enteric pathogen, compared with 35 (59%) of 59 of those randomized to receive a placebo.

Other organisms that may cause a fraction of the episodes of travelers' diarrhea include Plesiomonas shigelloides, enteroadherent E. coli, adenovirus or other viruses, and Cryptosporidium.

When compared with placebo BSS significantly reduced the number of unformed stools and increased the proportion of patients free of symptoms at the end of the trial. In the two studies that compared BSS with loperamide, the latter agent brought significantly faster relief. Diarrhea accompanied by dysenteric symptoms was influenced most favorably by administration of systemic antimicrobial agents. In all four studies only minor adverse effects were noted with BSS or the other active agents. One may include loperamide and a systemic antimicrobial agent in one's travel kit; however, loperamide should not be used for dysentery, and the antimicrobial agent should not be used in uncomplicated cases. As an alternative, although it is less effective, BSS has the unique advantage of being safe enough to use for all patients with travelers' diarrhea.\r"

Recently, the discovery of Campylobacter pylori and the observation that this bacterium is inhibited by bismuth salts have regenerated interest in the antibacterial properties of bismuth. Bismuth and heavy metals inhibit growth of all Campylobacter species and many enteric anaerobes. Bismuth alone cures C. pylori infection in only 30% of patients, but in combination with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, it can achieve a cure rate of 80%-90% in 2-4 weeks. Data from several studies indicate that eradication of C. pylori is curative for most patients with duodenal ulcer. Epidemiologic studies in the United States suggest that the incidence of new C. pylori infections is declining, so antibacterial therapy for symptomatic cases may be adequate therapy. In developing countries, however, curative therapy may not be possible in the presence of environmental sources of reinfection. In these areas intermittent suppressive therapy with bismuth salts may be useful.\r"

C. pylori was cleared from 14 (77.8%) of 18 patients given locally active bismuth, from one (6.7%) of 15 patients given erythromycin, and from none of 17 patients given placebo. Gastritis resolved in 13 (81%) of 16 patients treated with bismuth but in only three of 13 receiving erythromycin and in none of 16 patients given placebo. Results of endoscopic examination showed greater improvement in patients cleared of C. pylori than in those with persistent infection. Heartburn improved in 50% of patients who received bismuth compared with 17% of those given placebo. The success of bismuth is probably due to its local antimicrobial activity. Erythromycin may have been inactivated by the low pH in the areas colonized with C. pylori. Relapse is less frequent when a combination of bismuth and an antimicrobial agent is used; such a combination is characterized by local and systemic activity, stability at low pH, and good penetration into gastric mucus.\r"

Although initially recognized in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, C. pylori can also be isolated from apparently asymptomatic persons. C. pylori infection is infrequent in young children in developed countries; during adulthood C. pylori infection becomes progressively more frequent, a phenomenon that parallels the age distribution of type B gastritis. In developing countries infection is more common and begins earlier. Infection, once acquired, appears to persist, possibly for life, but the mode of transmission to humans is unknown. C. pylori is well adapted for survival in the gastric milieu, but whether C. pylori plays a causative role in gastritis is of critical importance. Favoring this hypothesis are the results of inoculation studies in volunteers and animals in which challenge with C. pylori resulted in persistent infection and histologic lesions. Treatment studies with antimicrobial agents indicate that removal of C. pylori is associated with improvement in histologic appearance of affected tissues and that when infection recurs the histologic appearance worsens. The mechanisms by which C. pylori infection may cause gastritis are unknown but possibilities include production of cytotoxin, degradation of physiologic defenses against acid-pepsin damage, and adherence to epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The endotoxic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from the envelope of Bacteroides fragilis is low compared with that of LPS from Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and other Enterobacteriaceae. Thus, pyrogenicity, the ability to prepare for or provoke the local Shwartzman reaction, and the ability to induce the production of interleukin 1 are reduced by 100- to 1,000-fold. Structural analyses of characterized B. fragilis LPS have shown that its lipid A is composed of a beta 1,6-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide that has the following properties: (1) a phosphate group on C1 of the reducing amino sugar, (2) amide- and ester-linked 3-hydroxylated branched and nonbranched long-chain (C15-C17) fatty acids, (3) an average of five fatty acids per glucosamine disaccharide, and (4) the core and O-antigenic saccharide chain linked to C6 of the nonreducing glucosamine residue. Although structurally similar to lipid A of E. coli, the lipid A of B. fragilis differs by its lack of the phosphate group on C4 of the nonreducing amino sugar and by the presence of fewer and different fatty acids. These differences explain the low endotoxic activity of B. fragilis LPS. The core and O-antigenic chain are linked to lipid A via a phosphorylated 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) residue. The saccharide chain is short and is composed of L-rhamnose, D-glucose, and D-galactose, with the O-antigenic specificity determined by a beta 1,6-linked D-galactose oligomer. This O-antigenic specificity was present in 14 of 17 strains of B. fragilis that were investigated.\r"

Clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group are typically resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. Naturally occurring antibodies in serum directed against these bacteria belong primarily to the IgM class. These antibodies are not required for activation of the alternative pathway by the bacteria but rather potentiate alternative pathway activation. Activation of the alternative pathway by the bacteria leads to the generation of chemotactic activity for neutrophils and to C3 deposition on the bacterial surfaces. Both iC3b, the predominant molecular form of the bacteria-bound C3, and IgM antibody are necessary for phagocytosis and killing of the bacteria by neutrophils. IgM acts synergistically with iC3b to facilitate adherence of the bacteria to the neutrophils. Certain Bacteroides strains require additional as yet uncharacterized auxiliary opsonins for maximal adherence to neutrophils.\r"

These studies have shown that obligate anaerobes are important components of the polymicrobic flora present during such infection. Moreover, certain anaerobes, such as Bacteroides fragilis, possess specific virulence factors, such as the capsular polysaccharide, that appear to be important to the infectious process. More recent research has used modifications of the original model system to evaluate the host immune response to B. fragilis. These studies indicate that immunization with the capsular polysaccharide provides a T cell-dependent immunity to abscess development when animals are challenged with B. fragilis. It has also been shown that the killing of B. fragilis is T cell dependent. The observations made with regard to B. fragilis in this animal model system are discussed.\r"

The development of an animal model that closely reproduces the disease observed in humans permitted careful inspection of the cellular and/or humoral contributions to the development and control of this disease. The results obtained thus far describe an immunoregulatory T cell circuit that governs both the development of and the immunity against these abscesses. T cells of CD4+8+ phenotype induce the development of IAA in response to B. fragilis. CD8+ T cells generated in response to immunization with the B. fragilis capsular polysaccharide confer protection against the development of IAA. These cells elaborate an antigen-specific factor that mediates the observed protection by these cells. Moreover, a third type of T cell, a CD8+ cell that is also present in nonimmune individuals, is required for the immune T cell or its factor to confer protection. Thus, in the specific disease process of IAA induced by the encapsulated microorganism B. fragilis, immunity proceeds by cellular and not humoral mechanisms.\r"

(2) How can the microbiologist, with limited and decreasing resources, perform reliable, detailed studies of anaerobic bacteriology? (3) When and how should susceptibility testing be done with anaerobes? If the clinician knows the usual bacteriology of various types of infection and how this may be modified by pathophysiologic processes in the host or by prior therapy, he/she can use a logical empiric approach to treatment of the patient. As to the microbiologist's dilemma, it is not realistic or rational for a microbiologist in a nonteaching hospital to do detailed bacteriologic studies and routine anaerobic susceptibility testing. The resources available should be committed primarily to the patient who is seriously ill. Such allocation of resources, of course, requires repeated and effective communication between microbiologist and clinician.\r"

  ".W": "The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, and blocked penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics through bacterial outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is production of beta-lactamases, which have been found in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is commonly mediated by beta-lactamases that are mainly cephalosporinase in character. B. fragilis strains can also produce penicillinases and enzymes inactivating cefoxitin and imipenem. The non-fragilis species of Bacteroides produce beta-lactamases that are mainly penicillinase in character. Penicillinases are also isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium clostridioforme, and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.\r"

The levels of incriminated colonic bacterial enzymes are increased by dietary fat and inhibited by certain dietary fibers. Organic extracts of feces contain a mutagenic substance, presumably derived from bacterial metabolism in the large bowel, that is positive in the Ames test. Whether this substance or some other organic chemical is the putative proximate carcinogen remains speculative, but the evidence continues to point to intestinal bacteria as the metabolic intermediary in colon cancer.\r"

The protein-tyrosine kinase activity and hybrid structure of P210bcr/abl are similar to the oncogene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, P160gag/v-abl, which induces acute lymphomas. To determine whether P210bcr/abl can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia, murine bone marrow was infected with a retrovirus encoding P210bcr/abl and transplanted into irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transplant recipients developed several hematologic malignancies; prominent among them was a myeloproliferative syndrome closely resembling the chronic phase of human chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor tissue from diseased mice harbored the provirus encoding P210bcr/abl. These results demonstrate that P210bcr/abl expression can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia. Retrovirus-mediated expression of the protein provides a murine model system for further analysis of the disease.\r"

This interaction is believed to mediate export of HIV structural messenger RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In this report the regions essential for Rev interaction with the RRE are further characterized and the functional significance of Rev-RRE interaction in vivo is examined. A single hairpin loop structure within the RRE was found to be a primary determinant for Rev binding in vitro and Rev response in vivo. Maintenance of secondary structure, rather than primary nucleotide sequence alone, appeared to be necessary for Rev-RNA interaction, which distinguishes it from the mechanism for cis-acting elements in DNA. Limited changes within the 200 nucleotides, which preserved the proper RRE conformational structure, were well tolerated for Rev binding and function. Thus, variation among the RRE elements present in the diverse HIV isolates would have little, if any, effect on Rev responsiveness.\r"

  ".U": "90161988\r", 
  ".W": "Ras proteins participate as a molecular switch in the early steps of the signal transduction pathway that is associated with cell growth and differentiation. When the protein is in its GTP complexed form it is active in signal transduction, whereas it is inactive in its GDP complexed form. A comparison of eight three-dimensional structures of ras proteins in four different crystal lattices, five with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog and three with GDP, reveals that the \"on\" and \"off\" states of the switch are distinguished by conformational differences that span a length of more than 40 A, and are induced by the gamma-phosphate. The most significant differences are localized in two regions: residues 30 to 38 (the switch I region) in the second loop and residues 60 to 76 (the switch II region) consisting of the fourth loop and the short alpha-helix that follows the loop. Both regions are highly exposed and form a continuous strip on the molecular surface most likely to be the recognition sites for the effector and receptor molecule(or molecules). The conformational differences also provide a structural basis for understanding the biological and biochemical changes of the proteins due to oncogenic mutations, autophosphorylation, and GTP hydrolysis, and for understanding the interactions with other proteins.\r"

The most frequent manifestations include dementia, pyramidal tract signs, and extrapyramidal movement disorder. Several clinically distinct syndromes can be identified. Often the diagnosis is confused with other forms of dementia, and the only definitive method for establishing the diagnosis is autopsy evaluation of brain tissue. Unfortunately, since the recognition of the infectious etiology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fear has often unreasonably interfered with clinical care and autopsy evaluation of affected patients. In actuality, because of the low and restricted infectivity of the responsible agent, affected individuals present minimal risks to clinical caretakers, and handling of patient specimens is not dangerous if appropriate precautions are taken. These precautions are well established, and physicians and other health care workers should not refuse care of appropriate evaluation (including autopsy) to individuals with suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\r"

The systolic-diastolic (S/D) ratio was considered an expression of vascular resistance peripheral to the point of insonation. Abnormal umbilical artery S/D ratio (greater than 95th percentile) alone or with abnormal uterine artery S/D ratio was associated with poor pregnancy outcome as judged by incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), cesarean section rate, birth weight, perinatal morbidity and mortality, and prematurity. In patients with preeclampsia and abnormal Doppler values, pregnancy outcome was poor, whereas in those with normal Doppler values, pregnancy outcome approached normal. The same relationship was also found in patients with chronic hypertension. The sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of IUGR by the umbilical artery S/D ratio alone was 71% and 93%, respectively. The uterine artery S/D ratio alone yielded a 66% sensitivity and 64% specificity, and when both tests were taken into account, the sensitivity increased to 75% and the specificity to 100%. Abnormal umbilical and uterine artery S/D ratios were associated with 100% IUGR and 25% perinatal mortality. We conclude that in pregnant women with hypertensive disorders there is a significant difference in pregnancy outcome between those with normal and those with abnormal Doppler values. Umbilical artery S/D ratio alone is a better predictor of IUGR and poor pregnancy outcome than the uterine artery S/D ratio.\r"

These rates, elevated in the morbidly obese, prompted a splenic preservation policy for any splenic injury during bariatric surgery. This review was needed to assess how this policy affected this population's intrinsically high perioperative risks. Six of 200 patients having primary or revisional vertical banded gastroplasty for morbid obesity or failure of previous bariatric surgery had splenic injury. In one case, splenectomy was necessary; in the other five, splenic repair was relatively easy and was not followed by problems related specifically to splenic surgery. Risks for splenic injury include previous operation, rigid retractors, adhesions in the left upper quadrant, and traction on adjacent viscera. We conclude that splenic injury during bariatric surgery should be repaired by the simplest hemostatic method(s). Splenectomy should be reserved for the irreparably injured organ or when instability of the patient's condition demands promptness.\r"

Chronic use of buspirone for up to 52 weeks was associated with emergence of no new or unexpected side effects that were not previously reported during shorter periods of treatment. Most patients were successfully managed on daily doses ranging from 15 to 30 mg/day. When buspirone therapy was abruptly discontinued after more than six months of therapy, assessments of patients yielded no evidence of a withdrawal syndrome or unusual events. Although long-term anxiolytic drug therapy is not generally recommended, this open study provides evidence of the potential usefulness of buspirone when used for up to one year. As a general guideline, when an anxiolytic agent is used for several months or longer to treat chronic anxiety, the need for drug therapy should be reevaluated periodically.\r"

Because this patient had rigors during an infusion through the catheter just before the acute respiratory arrest, we suspect that infusion through the colonized catheter precipitated the respiratory arrest.\r"

At present, the technology is most effectively applied to superficial vessels such as the carotid, common femoral, and popliteal arteries. Measurement can be compromised by heavy vessel calcification, and the technique is most useful in mild to moderate disease. Prospective blinded trials have shown that HRUS can be used to determine lumen diameter and per cent stenosis, although its accuracy is improved by adding frequency analysis. The technique is most useful for interrogating the atherosclerotic plaque itself; as such, it appears superior to angiographic techniques. Several investigators have documented the ability of HRUS to characterize plaque and particularly to identify intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration. Criteria for diagnosis remain difficult to standardize and, for the moment, must be developed for each center involved in these studies. The future of HRUS appears to lie in development of more detailed analyses of plaque morphology and the study of atherosclerotic disease in large populations over time.\r"

Duplex ultrasonography provides a very reliable noninvasive technique for this assessment. Flow in the vertebral artery system can be noninvasively quantified in greater than 95 per cent of all patients examined using this technique, and such measurements help identify subgroups of patients whose symptoms may be related to posterior circulation ischemia. Further evaluation of the spectral flow patterns is often helpful in diagnosing the cause of these ischemic symptoms. Unfortunately, quantitative flows are rarely obtained during routine carotid ultrasound studies. Such data, however, may provide an objective basis for the following kinds of surgical decisions: 1. Recommendations for carotid surgery in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis but nonlocalizing symptoms. 2. Recommendations for no surgery in patients who have vertebrobasilar symptoms but diminished flow characteristic of poor cardiac output. 3. Recommendations for surgery to augment vertebral artery flow in patients who have vertebrobasilar symptoms, decreased vertebral flow on the basis of proximal stenosis, and normal carotid artery flow. Obviously, there is a need to confirm these hypotheses by studying patients thoroughly before and after surgery. Other investigators must begin gathering data on vertebral artery flow to determine its impact and utility in making surgical decisions.\r"

The combination of pressure measurements and duplex color-flow imaging is the most effective technique for infrainguinal bypass surveillance. The accuracy of this protocol for the detection of graft stenosis is comparable to arteriography, and graft revision can be recommended and implemented based on noninvasive testing alone. Although similar anatomic and blood-flow data can be obtained by conventional duplex scanning, graft surveillance using color-flow imaging is preferred because both vascular anatomy and hemodynamics are evaluated simultaneously, a feature that improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces examination time. By contrast, resting ABI measurements alone are unable to identify reliably a failing graft; they are useful primarily for confirming technical adequacy and relief of ischemia. Data exist that confirm that long-term patency of infrainguinal bypasses is improved if hemodynamically significant stenoses are revised prior to graft thrombosis rather than revised or replaced after thrombosis. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should undergo graft revision when noninvasive testing has confirmed the presence of a correctable lesion that reduces both limb pressure (change in ABI greater than 0.15) and graft blood-flow velocity (Vp less than 45 cm per second). Drops in pressure can occur in the absence of abnormalities in graft blood flow, but this condition does not indicate impending graft thrombosis. The identification of high-grade (greater than 75 per cent) stenosis by duplex scanning or color-flow imaging has been uniformly associated with a reduced ABI and increased risk of graft thrombosis. Less-severe lesions can be followed for disease progression as long as graft blood flow is adequate to sustain patency. In bypasses with low flow but no correctable abnormality, oral anticoagulation with warfarin sodium may decrease the incidence of graft thrombosis.\r"

When digital ischemia is suspected, the Doppler examination combined with intermittent compression of the radial and ulnar arteries is valuable for defining the variable arterial anatomy of the hand and the patency of the common and proper digital arteries. The extent of distal ischemia can be assessed by digital pressures. Duplex scanning has been found to be of value in determining the source of upper-extremity micro-emboli, in imaging suspected aneurysmal changes, and for evaluating arteriovenous fistulae and bypass grafts. Cold testing is used to confirm the diagnosis of Raynaud's disease after excluding proximal occlusive disease. When symptoms suggest intermittent arterial obstruction, arterial compression at the thoracic outlet is assessed by monitoring the arterial waveform during a series of maneuvers that change the anatomy of the outlet. Although a combination of IPG and venous Doppler examination accurately identifies venous occlusion, we routinely use duplex scanning in this setting. In addition to providing both anatomic and hemodynamic information about the subclavian vein, the jugular vein and the junction of the innominate vein can also be studied. Because of its ability to image in a coronal plane, MRI scanning is another nonivasive study that we have found useful for evaluation of venous anatomy and patency of the subclavian, jugular, and innominate veins. Venous thrombosis, often the first manifestation of subclavian vein compression at the thoracic inlet, is best evaluated using duplex scanning.\r"

  ".W": "Of a total of 77 patients affected by hydatid cysts of the liver observed between 1983 and 1988, we examined a group of 25 patients with cysts that had migrated into the thorax. The main characteristic of these patients was the hydatid hepatic cyst, which was situated in the right hepatic lobe in every patient, involving one or more right hemithoracic structures. In 24 patients, there were different combinations of symptoms, but only ten were thoracic. In those with advanced intrathoracic evolution of the hydatid cyst, we not only found a destruction of the hemidiaphragm, but also the presence of pleural effusion, empyema, atelectasis and multiple pleural hydatidosis caused by the development of a cystic fistula in the pleural cavity. Analysis of these instances allowed us to see that ultrasonograms of the liver and roentgenograms of the thorax are often the most sensitive and reliable diagnostic procedures for showing the intrathoracic evolution of the cyst. We believe that the surgical treatment must be carried out with simultaneous right thoracoabdominal access, which, besides exposing the thoracic lesions, also permits adequate treatment of the hepatic hydatid cyst and the possible associated biliary complications.\r"

  ".W": "Different techniques have been used for biliary reconstruction in transplantation of the liver. Early techniques of cholecystodoudenostomy and cholecystojejunostomy had high rates of biliary complications often with associated mortality. Today, most centers use a choledochocholedochostomy with a T tube (CC-T) or Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy (RYCJ) for biliary reconstruction in hepatic transplantation with a low mortality rate but still significant morbidity. In our early experience at the University of Chicago, we used CC-T as the procedure of choice and RYCJ in the remaining instances. However, it was noted that a large number of biliary complications in the CC-T group were related to the use of T tubes, which prompted us to consider the use of primary anatomosis without tube drainage or stenting (CC). We reviewed 136 transplants with a graft survival rate of greater than two weeks. The over-all complication rates for each group were 38 CC, 18 per cent; 26 CC-T, 35 per cent, and 72 RYCJ, 21 per cent. One patient died as a direct result of a biliary complication. The main difference between CC and CC-T was early biliary complications (5 versus 31 per cent, p less than 0.02 most were T-tube related. We advocate the use of CC (without a T tube) when-possible. We recommend RYCJ whenever reoperation and biliary revision are required. We have found that both CC and RYCJ can be used safely for biliary reconstruction in hepatic transplantation.\r"

The end results after completion of the resection assures fixation of the biliary and pancreatic duct to the posterior wall of the duodenum, which minimizes the risk of biliary or pancreatic leakage. Results of local excision of the papilla of Vater for periampullary tumors appear satisfactory and this procedure may be particularly indicated for older or higher risk patients. Pancreaticoduodenectomy should probably remain the procedure of choice for reasonably fit patients with established malignant disease.\r"

The evidence for clinical benefit seems much more limited. In general, a benefit of cytoreduction in extending the survival or disease-free interval appears likely only if there is effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Hence, benefits of cytoreduction have been acknowledged in pediatric solid tumors, lymphoma and carcinoma of the ovary, for which effective adjuvant treatments exist. Patients with certain tumors that exhibit biologically favorable characteristics may benefit from cytoreduction, even though the usefulness of other treatment modalities may be minimal.

Although Penfield has provided more than adequate information on certain aspects of his sister's illness, little has been published concerning her subsequent operation performed by Dr. Harvey Cushing at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. We feel this case is significant for several reasons. First, it sheds some light on Penfield's personal relationship with Cushing and his sister; it also shows the deep interest that Dr. Cushing took in his patients. Second, this case nicely illustrates how Cushing used his postoperative drawings to make his operative notes more precise. Finally, we see a sample of the work done by Dr. Louise Eisenhardt as pathologist at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.\r"

To define further the effects of radiosurgery, we present the correlation among clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data in three patients with different intracranial tumors who died between 2 and 39 weeks after radiosurgery. The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis. Radiosurgery appears to cause acute necrosis of malignant cells, although its effectiveness may be limited by the infiltrative nature of some tumors. In benign tumors, necrosis following radiosurgery is relatively delayed, and may not be required for growth arrest.\r"

An overview of the results suggests that the risk of a neurological complication (TIA or stroke) is about 4% and that a permanent neurological deficit (disabling stroke) occurs in about 1%. The mortality rate is very low (less than 0.1%). Systemic complications are not infrequent, particularly with intravenous digital subtraction angiography. The complication rate of cerebral angiography must be considered when evaluating the risks of carotid endarterectomy in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Changes in mean blood velocity and pulsatility index were analyzed in 19 treated feeding arteries. Blood velocity decreased by a mean of 38.1% or 46.5 cm/sec (p less than 0.0001, two-tailed paired t test); decreases were greater for surgically resected arteries (46.2% or 55.9 cm/sec, p less than 0.003) than for embolized arteries (30.8% or 38.0 cm/sec, p less than 0.0003). Pulsatility index increased by a mean of 54.7% or 0.25 (p = 0.0001); increases were greater for surgically resected arteries (65.8% or 0.29, p = 0.0045) than for embolized arteries (44.8% or 0.20, p less than 0.001). The differences in the changes in blood velocity and pulsatility index between treatment groups were not significant. These data demonstrate that embolization results in hemodynamic changes that are qualitatively similar to those occurring after surgical resection of arteriovenous malformations. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is a reliable and convenient noninvasive method for monitoring hemodynamic effects of treatments for arteriovenous malformations.\r"

In vitro autoradiography indicates that the distribution of 3H-TCP binding in brain closely parallels that of [3H]glutamate binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. In nine 7-day-old rats, an acute focal hypoxic-ischemic insult produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 8% oxygen acutely reduced 3H-TCP binding ipsilateral to the ligation by 30% in the CA1, by 27% in the CA3, by 26% in the dentate gyrus, and by 17% in the striatum compared with values from the contralateral hemisphere. In 10 littermates that received 1 mg/kg of the neuroprotective noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist MK-801 immediately before hypoxic exposure, the regional distribution of 3H-TCP binding in hypoxic-ischemic brain was relatively preserved and there were no interhemispheric asymmetries in 3H-TCP binding densities. In addition, in three unoperated rats decapitated 24 hours after MK-801 treatment, 3H-TCP binding was reduced by 15-35%; similar bilateral suppression of 3H-TCP binding was detected in MK-801-treated ligates. Our data indicate that 3H-TCP autoradiography can be used to assay the efficacy of neuroprotective agents in this experimental model of perinatal stroke.\r"

Cerebral blood flow measured by xenon-133 inhalation showed reduced resting flows and a focal perfusion deficit in the right dorsofrontal and upper rolandic regions. Blood flow velocity and pulsatility index of the right middle cerebral artery measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography were also reduced. With hypercapnic challenge, both hemispheric tissue perfusion and blood flow velocity showed impaired reactivity. With induced hypotension, the focal perfusion deficit in the right dorsofrontal region was accentuated. Following right internal carotid endartectomy, resting cerebral blood flow and blood flow velocity improved, as did hypercapnic vasoreactivity. These reversible deficits in cerebral blood flow and vasoregulation, which were maximal in the dorsofrontal region, are consistent with low perfusion in the border zone territory or the distal fields and demonstrate that hemodynamic failure is the likely mechanism for limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks from severe carotid artery disease.\r"

To identify the membrane components previously detected by hemagglutination with HLA class I-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), RBC membrane preparations were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the HLA class I MoAbs. Two components were obtained that reacted with the MoAbs: a heavy chain of 45 kDa and a light chain termed beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M) of 11 kDa. The effect of chloroquine and acid elution in stripping HLA antigens is shown to be due to the removal of beta2-M, as only that component was detected in eluates from reactive RBCs. Neither antibody elution method affected the heavy chain expression assessed by immunoblotting. It is concluded that HLA class I antigens on RBCs are integral membrane components of the type normally found and wisely distributed on many nucleated cells. Platelets, which have stronger HLA class I antigen expression, were also studied, and their membrane preparations yielded heavy chain and beta2-M molecules; the effect of chloroquine treatment was harder to assess than that of acid elution, owing to the sensitivity with which both components are detected in immunoblotting. In eluates obtained from acid treatment only beta2-M is detected.\r"

This study tested the ability of a cell separator bowl seal system to resist penetration of microbial contamination under normal running conditions and under extreme environmental stress. Three test organisms, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were applied directly to the bowl at the edge of the seal or aerosolized and passed through the centrifuge chamber while the cell separator was run through a simulated platelet collection. A sterile, bacteriologic nutrient medium was perfused through the tubing set, thus simulating the flow of blood fractions. Following the procedure, the medium was examined for microbial growth. The concentration of aerosolized bacteria ranged from 5.2 x 10(1) to 3.9 x 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU) per mL, and the concentration of bacteria applied to the edge of the seal ranged from 1.9 x 10(5) to 2.8 x 10(9) CFU per mL. The positive control, direct inoculation of S. marcescens into the circulating medium (50 CFU/500 mL), resulted in recovery of the identical organism after 24 hours' incubation. No contamination of the system was detected in 40 experiments with aerosolized bacteria or in 32 experiments in which bacteria were applied directly to the seal. This study demonstrates that this sealed-bowl system resists microbial contamination.\r"

We reasoned that we could exploit the cross-reactivity of the anti-HIV-1 EIA as a means to monitor the blood supply for the appearance of HIV-2 infected or co-infected persons, and thus decide if and when routine HIV-2 screening should be adopted. We tested 913 anti-HIV-1-reactive donor sera using an anti-HIV-2 screening EIA, with confirmation by an anti-HIV-2 env-peptide EIA and an anti-HIV-2 Western blot. These 913 sera were derived from anti-HIV-1 screening of approximately 242,000 donations over a three year period. No HIV-2 infections were identified. This approach may warrant adoption in blood centers serving populations with persons from countries where HIV-2 is prevalent.\r"

  ".W": "Without question, significant changes, and for the most part significant advances, have been made in the management of patients with urolithiasis during the past decade. The newer therapeutic measures have generally made it easier for patients to be treated, but the decision-making process for the urologist has become more complex. In the past, the issue whether to follow a patient with a stone or to intervene with surgery or transurethral cystoscopic basketing was decided based on well-established guidelines that had developed over many years. Today, the indications for intervention appear to be less stringent, and in the minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patient who would not have been operated on previously, there appears to be an expanding desire for prophylactic management. For whatever reasons, once it has been established that a stone is present and the decision has been made to intervene, subsequent decisions regarding the technical approach may also not be as simple as in the past. Ten years ago, for example, a stone in the abdominal ureter was removed by a ureterolithotomy, and the principal decision involved placement of the incision. Today, the same calculus may be approached by ESWL with or without a stent, by antegrade percutaneous techniques, or by retrograde ureteroscopic techniques using rigid or flexible endoscopes with baskets, ultrasonic lithotrites, or lasers. Although the specific indication for specific techniques continue to evolve, it has become evident that information obtained by the radiographic evaluation of the urinary tract is critical in the decision-making process. The intravenous urogram, including the initial plain film, remains the primary diagnostic modality and, in the absence of extenuating clinical features, is often the sole test required to make a decision regarding the best therapeutic modality. A variety of clinical features from the history or physical examination, or concerns raised by the intravenous urogram, may necessitate alternative or additional techniques to better define the anatomy, the renal function, or other pathology. The urologist therefore needs to be familiar with the information that can be obtained from the uroradiologist's vast armamentarium in order to make the most appropriate recommendations to the patient for diagnosis and management.\r"

Those physicians who are not familiar with percutaneous techniques, or who do not have the necessary equipment available, may actually attempt ESWL for all calculi regardless of stone burden or location. Patients who are interested in avoiding manipulation may request ESWL, even if the results may not be as good as those obtained with concomitant manipulation or with percutaneous procedures. Nevertheless, indications still exist for percutaneous techniques, and these procedures will not become obsolete even as ESWL technology advances. Studies are being conducted to identify the ideal treatment for all varieties of stones in the genitourinary system. As ESWL and endoscopic technology continue to advance, the treatment of stone disease will continue to change.\r"

  ".U": "90163093\r", 
  ".W": "Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has revolutionized the treatment of urinary calculi. It should be considered the treatment of choice for renal stones smaller than 2 cm and for the majority of ureteral calculi, under which circumstances success rates approaching 80 to 90 per cent may be anticipated. Larger renal calculi or impacted ureteral stones probably should be managed by endoscopic techniques with or without adjunctive intracorporeal (ultrasonic or electrohydraulic) lithotripsy or laser fragmentation. Recent modifications in lithotripter design have been focused on the development of pain-free lithotripsy. Concomitant with a decrease in power, however, is an attendant decrease in the efficiency with which stones can be fragmented, resulting in an increase in the number of lithotripsy treatments required for adequate stone fragmentation. Additionally, sonography is assuming an increasing role in stone localization, and its use will require sonographic training on the part of the urologist. Biliary lithotripsy has been promising in preliminary European studies, with success rates approaching 90 per cent. It must be noted, however, that the U.S. experience has not been as impressive. Moreover, only 20 to 30 per cent of patients referred for biliary lithotripsy appear to be optimal candidates for this new technique. Adjunctive dissolution of gallstones with chronic oral medical therapy may be required after biliary lithotripsy, and long-term follow-up studies still need to be performed. Finally, the potential deleterious effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy must always be kept in mind. Although the majority of clinical and animal investigations have documented no significant long-term alterations in renal function, care must still be exercised when performing lithotripsy with the knowledge of the potential for long-term injurious effects on the functioning renal parenchyma.\r"

At present 140 of these patients in treatment Groups I and II are being followed up. With additional follow-up, BCG continued to produce a higher percentage of complete remissions (71%) than doxorubicin (54%). The percentage of incomplete remission with BCG (7%) was half that with doxorubicin (14%). Half of the patients whose initial therapy failed had complete remission after additional therapy. However, for patients with recurrence, additional follow-up shows a recurrence rate per 100 patient-months for BCG (1.0) only slightly lower than that for doxorubicin (1.1). The percentage of progressions continued to be higher with BCG (8.5%) than with doxorubicin (5%), but the difference between these results for the two drugs proved slightly less than we reported previously. Of the patients in this study, 2.5 percent (all treated with BCG) required cystectomy. A comparison of the results of our study with those of 13 other studies using BCG to treat bladder cancer indicates that therapy beyond an initial course of 6 weekly treatments increases the percentage of complete response. All of the studies showed that the greatest improvement in percentage of complete response occurred with the second course of treatment. The value of maintenance therapy cannot yet be determined, since few studies have used that protocol. The percentage of patients requiring cystectomy in studies with fewer than 20 treatments was 2.2 times higher than in studies with more than 20 treatments.\r"

Only six patients had overt hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium less than 0.70 mmol per liter [1.7 mg per dl]). The mean serum magnesium concentration in hypocalcemic patients was not significantly lower than in normocalcemic patients, but the mononuclear cell magnesium content in hypocalcemic patients with pancreatitis was significantly lower than in normocalcemic patients with pancreatitis (P less than .01). The serum magnesium level did not correlate with that of serum calcium or the mononuclear cell magnesium content, but the latter did significantly correlate with the serum calcium concentration (r = .81, P less than .001). Most patients with hypocalcemia had a low intracellular magnesium content. Three normomagnesemic, hypocalcemic patients with alcoholic pancreatitis also underwent low-dose parenteral magnesium tolerance testing and showed increased retention of the magnesium load. We conclude that patients with acute pancreatitis and hypocalcemia commonly have magnesium deficiency despite normal serum magnesium concentrations. Magnesium deficiency may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of hypocalcemia in patients with acute pancreatitis.\r"

The mean systolic pressure during nifedipine treatment was 14.2 mm of mercury lower (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 24.5 mm of mercury) and mean diastolic pressure 5.5 mm of mercury (95% CI, 0.3 to 10.7 mm of mercury) lower than with metoprolol therapy. Both drugs were reasonably well tolerated, and intolerance requiring withdrawal was encountered in 3 of 45 (7%) patients receiving nifedipine, compared with 1 of 45 (2%) of those taking metoprolol and placebo, respectively. Adverse effects of nifedipine, most of which were transient, included palpitations, headache, facial flushing, and ankle edema. Long-acting nifedipine is a promising agent when given alone for mild to moderate hypertension and can be safely administered in clinical practice.\r"

Indications for its use have expanded to include many other cutaneous and noncutaneous neoplasms. Usually done as an outpatient procedure and using local anesthesia, a layer of tissue is excised, mapped in relation to the site of removal, sectioned horizontally, and examined for the presence of residual tumor. This sequence is repeated, removing only tissue that contains residual tumor, until a margin completely free of cancer is reached. Extremely high cure rates are achieved, and surrounding tissue is maximally conserved for wound repair.\r"

  ".W": "A wide variety of conditions seen in medical practice can produce memory impairment (amnesia). Normal aging, depression, and anxiety are commonly associated with memory difficulties, as are many neurologic conditions. Systemic illnesses can impair memory by injuring vulnerable limbic regions sensitive to hypoxia or hypoglycemia. Commonly used over-the-counter and prescription medications can likewise cause amnesia. These conditions disrupt memory in characteristic ways. Recent studies suggest that immediate, recent, and remote memory functions have different neuroanatomic substrates, as do the processes of registration, retention, and retrieval. New classifications have emerged to explain the evidence for multiple memory subsystems. The neuropharmacology of memory now includes several peptides in addition to cholinergic and noradrenergic pathways. Critical limbic regions have been discovered that mediate memory consolidation, and neuronal mechanisms such as long-term potentiation are being implicated in the unique capacity of these areas to permit new learning to take place.\r"

The results show that family physicians are more likely to stay in their field of training; to locate more frequently in rural and underserved areas; to see fewer referred patients; to have similar case severity; and to engage in more obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, trauma, acute illness, and pediatrics. Family physicians spend less time per patient, ask fewer history questions, obtain fewer physical examination items, order fewer diagnostic studies, make referrals less often, and hospitalize patients less often. The reasons for the practice style differences between family physicians and internists are likely to be multiple, but they probably include such factors as: training, decision-making expertise, patient demands, types of visits, office staff, economics, and attitude. The implications of the proposed reasons for the differences are discussed.\r"

This may be due to delayed diagnoses and a higher frequency of mucin-producing tumors and advanced stage of the disease. This article presents a case report and review of the literature and alerts the primary care physician to the possibility of serious disease in young adults who may present with protracted abdominal symptoms. Age should not be a barrier in the application of diagnostic tools. The duration and degree of symptoms should prompt early investigation.\r"

The risk of complications from the procedure is low. Fewer penile problems occur in circumcised boys than in uncircumcised boys.

Metoclopramide is a useful adjunctive drug for intestinal intubation and radiologic examination. It has also been used intravenously to control the nausea and vomiting of intensive cancer chemotherapy, such as with cisplatin. Metoclopramide is a powerful antiemetic because of its combined actions on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and intestinal motility. This agent is generally not intended for long-term use. The oral preparations are recommended for four to 12 weeks of therapy. Use of parenteral metoclopramide should be limited to one or two days. The most common adverse reactions are restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue and lassitude. Extrapyramidal symptoms occur rarely and only with high dosage or prolonged use.\r"

  ".W": "Cycle length variability (CLV), defined as the standard deviation of normal cycle length intervals, has been found to be a powerful predictor of subsequent mortality in a population of 808 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Decreased CLV is associated with a significant increase in mortality. CLV remained an independent predictor of outcome even after adjusting for left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical risk factors, heart rate and ventricular arrhythmias. In the same population of survivors of acute myocardial infarction, the results of exercise testing also strongly predicted outcome, with those failing to take the test having the worst survival, and those completing the low-level stress test taken before discharge having the best prognosis. The hypothesis that the status of stress test (completed; did not complete; failed to take) and CLV were measuring the same factor related to mortality was tested. Although the distribution of CLV was shifted to higher CLV in patients who completed the test and to lower CLV in those who failed to take the test, both predictors of mortality remained independent predictors of long-term mortality (average of 31 months of follow-up) after controlling for each other. Moreover, subgroups with an approximate 15-fold difference in mortality were defined using both variables (CLV less than 50 ms, did not take test had a 54% mortality; CLV greater than 100 ms, completed the test had a mortality of 3.5%). CLV is a measure of autonomic tone; it is not strongly related to exercise ability and using the results of both stress testing and CLV results in the identification of subgroups of postinfarction patients with markedly disparate risks of mortality.\r"

In 91% of cases the arrest occurred at the time the patient's cardiac rhythm was monitored. Patients were divided into 2 age groups: elderly patients were greater than 70 years (187) and younger patients were less than 70 years (194). Elderly patients more commonly had a past history of heart failure (25 vs 10%, p less than 0.003) and were more commonly taking digoxin (40 vs 20%, p less than 0.005) and diuretics (35 vs 25%, p less than 0.004). Before the cardiac arrest, elderly patients were more likely to be complaining of dyspnea (53 vs 40%, p less than 0.009), whereas younger patients were more likely to complain of chest pain (27 vs 13%, p less than 0.001). Forty-two percent of younger patients demonstrated ventricular fibrillation as the initial out-of-hospital rhythm associated with the arrest, compared to only 22% of elderly patients (p less than 0.001). Besides patient age, initial cardiac rhythm varied according to the patient's complaint preceding the arrest. Sixty-eight percent of patients with chest pain demonstrated ventricular fibrillation, whereas only 21% of patients with dyspnea demonstrated ventricular fibrillation. Elderly patients could be as successfully resuscitated as younger patients; however, 24% of younger patients survived, compared to only 10% of elderly patients (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Brachial artery flow patterns were studied in 10 hyperthyroid and 10 normal subjects. Mean blood velocity and flow were evaluated by pulsed Doppler, and peak systolic acceleration was calculated by computer-assisted digitization of the instantaneous velocity curve. Compared to control subjects, hyperthyroid patients had higher velocity and flow (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.02) and higher peak systolic acceleration (p less than 0.01). In hyperthyroid patients, measurements were repeated after (1) mechanical exclusion of the hand from brachial circulation, (2) short-term beta-blocker treatment and (3) inducement of the euthyroid state. Exclusion of the hand reduced velocity and flow (p less than 0.001) but did not change peak systolic acceleration. Beta blockade induced disparate changes of velocity and flow but reduced peak systolic acceleration (p less than 0.05). In the euthyroid state, decreased blood velocity (p less than 0.01), flow (p less than 0.02) and acceleration (p less than 0.02) were observed. A hyperkinetic arterial circulation consisting of an increase in both velocity and acceleration is thus observable in hyperthyroidism. Hand exclusion showed that velocity seems to be influenced by peripheral factors while beta blockade suggests that acceleration is dependent of beta 1 adrenoceptors. Comparison between euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism indicates that both mean blood velocity and peak systolic acceleration are influenced by thyroid hormones.\r"

Of the 1,817 adults, 443 received only placebo or comparative agents and 1,374 received moricizine in daily doses of 50 to 1,800 mg. A total of 1,190 adult patients (mean age 59 years) had ventricular arrhythmias classified as either benign (8%), potentially lethal (58%) or lethal (33%). Most patients had a history of greater than or equal to 1 cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Antiarrhythmic activity was assessed by four methods: 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, programmed electrical stimulation, exercise tolerance tests, and global evaluation (only for some patients in the compassionate-use program). In addition, the effects of moricizine on symptoms associated with ventricular arrhythmias were assessed. The safety variables evaluated included adverse experiences, proarrhythmia, congestive heart failure, other cardiovascular effects, death, chest x-ray, ophthalmic examinations, neuroleptic phenothiazine effects and clinical laboratory tests.\r"

In preclinical studies, it produces a concentration-dependent decrease in the maximal rate of phase 0 depolarization, speeds repolarization of phases 2 and 3, and decreases the action potential duration and effective refractory period duration in cardiac Purkinje fibers. It has no effect on the slope of phase 4 depolarization, but suppresses normal automaticity in vitro and in vivo and suppresses abnormal automaticity in depolarized Purkinje fibers. Also, it suppresses early afterdepolarizations, delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In patients, moricizine has minimal effects on the normal sinus node, slows conduction in the atrium, atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system and ventricular myocardium and has little effect on the atrial and ventricular refractoriness. The intensity of moricizine action on the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system and JT interval are dose-related. Co-administration of digoxin and moricizine intensified the lengthening of the PR, AH and HV intervals, and produced more shortening of the JT interval. Patients in whom moricizine was efficacious had a significantly greater lengthening of the AH and QRS intervals than those in whom moricizine was not efficacious. In some patients with sinus node dysfunction, moricizine produced sinus bradycardia, increased sinus node recovery time, and produced second-degree or complete sinoatrial block.\r"

The drug has a large apparent volume of distribution (approximately 4 liters/kg), exhibits extensive plasma protein binding (approximately 95%) and produces at least 30 metabolites. Indirect evidence indicates that some of those metabolites may be pharmacologically active. The elimination half-life of moricizine is 2 to 6 hours, but its duration of antiarrhythmic action is much longer suggesting active metabolites. Moricizine induces its own metabolism with no change in pharmacologic effect. It also induces the metabolism of theophylline and specific pathways of antipyrine. Cimetidine reduces metabolism of moricizine but does not alter its pharmacologic effects. This observation provides further support for the hypothesis that the metabolites of moricizine contribute to the pharmacologic actions during therapy and indicate that plasma level monitoring is not likely to be of value. There are no known clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between moricizine and digoxin, warfarin or propranolol. Excessive prolongation of the PR interval has been seen in some patients receiving both digoxin and moricizine, probably due to additive electrophysiologic effects of the 2 drugs.\r"

In dose-ranging and titration trials as well as in a cross-study analysis of th entire data base, the minimally effective dose for moricizine was found to be 600 mg/day and the optimal dose range from 600 to 900 mg/day. The dose efficacy relation plateaued beyond 900 mg/day. With use of a 75% reduction in ventricular premature complex frequency as the definition of a drug responder, 391 of 583 patients (67%) with paired Holter monitors demonstrated overall efficacy. The dose onset of moricizine was between 16 and 20 hours and the dose offset was at approximately 24 hours at the point when 50% of the ventricular arrhythmia frequency returned to baseline. Although moricizine was primarily given on a 3-times-a-day regimen during clinical trials, dose interval evaluation suggested that a twice-a-day regimen may produce the same degree of efficacy although there are limited data regarding comparable safety.\r"

Efficacy is sustained during long-term therapy. Evaluation of moricizine therapy for sustained VT using programmed stimulation has been carefully performed in more than 100 patients. The initiation of sustained VT is suppressed in 20 to 25% of patients. Moricizine is generally well tolerated. Because of its minimal effects on left ventricular function, a common clinical problem in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and relatively low potential for proarrhythmia, moricizine has a role in the treatment of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in selected patients.\r"

Adverse effects led to discontinuation of moricizine therapy in 116 patients (9%). Organ toxicity consisted predominantly of drug fever, possible thrombocytopenia and elevated liver function tests and was quite low (less than 0.7%) for both short- and long-term studies.

  ".W": "Many patients who have serious ventricular arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic drug therapy have congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antiarrhythmic drugs are altered in the presence of CHF. It has been reported that some adverse effects, primarily aggravation of arrhythmia and CHF occur more frequently in patients with a history of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Moreover, antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective in patients with a history of CHF and a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Moricizine, a new antiarrhythmic drug, has been undergoing clinical trials for over 13 years in the United States. The data base involving 1,072 patients was analyzed to establish the effect of this agent in patients with CHF. The presence of CHF does not alter the absorption, half-life and clearance of moricizine. The incidence of CHF exacerbation definitely related to moricizine was low (2%) and occurred primarily in patients with a history of CHF. Aggravation of arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities also occurred more often in patients with prior CHF. However, the incidence of all other adverse effects involving other organ systems was the same in patients with and without CHF and was also unrelated to the baseline LVEF. The effect of moricizine for suppressing spontaneously occurring ventricular ectopy was also similar in patients with and without CHF and was independent of LVEF. However, the drug is less effective in preventing sustained ventricular arrhythmia in patients with CHF.\r"

  ".U": "90164446\r", 
  ".W": "The selection of antiarrhythmic drug therapy requires a careful assessment of the benefits of ventricular arrhythmia suppression compared with the risks of antiarrhythmic drug use. Since reduction in sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia suppression has not been demonstrated, the only indications for antiarrhythmic drug suppression involve the reduction of hemodynamic symptoms such as syncope (a major benefit) or the reduction of nonhemodynamic symptoms such as palpitations or dizziness (a minor benefit). Noncardiac adverse effects and organ toxicity as well as cardiac side effects must be considered when antiarrhythmic drug therapy is initiated. For reduction of nonhemodynamically important symptoms in patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, beta blockers are chosen as first-line therapy. Because of moricizine's relatively high effectiveness in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and its low potential for noncardiac adverse effects and organ toxicity as well as a low incidence of induced proarrhythmia and heart failure, moricizine is selected as the next drug in line. All other class I antiarrhythmic drugs either have been shown to have the potential for increasing sudden cardiac death or have major rates of noncardiac adverse effects or organ toxicity that preclude their use in these patient groups except in special circumstances. In patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias who present with hemodynamic consequences such as syncope or worse, moricizine also is preferred as an initial drug for consideration. When compared to drugs with class IA and IB action, moricizine has comparable efficacy yet lower rates of noncardiac adverse effects, organ toxicity, proarrhythmia and heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

TMR at 36 wk (3.65 +/- 0.50 kcal/min) was significantly higher than at 24 wk (3.38 +/- 0.43 kcal/min) or at 9 wk postpartum (3.38 +/- 0.43 kcal/min).

In eight women the energy cost of self-paced walking on a treadmill was measured. The absolute and net energy cost decreased sharply from 6 to 12 wk gestation (by 8% and 11%, respectively) but remained unchanged afterwards.

Serum assays for biochemistry, glucose, insulin, C peptide, glucagon, cortisol, and PP were performed at the beginning and end of the infusion. Although infusion of PP increased PP concentrations 10-fold, it did not cause physical signs or symptoms, changes in vital signs, or changes in serum biochemistry. Although the test design was sufficiently sensitive to reveal an effect of the pretest meal on subsequent food intake, there was no difference in eating behavior with the saline and PP infusions. This suggests that a short-term normalization of blood PP concentrations does not correct the excessive food intake.\r"

REE of the VLCD patients increased during 12 subsequent weeks of realimentation such that differences in REE between the two groups were not statistically significant at week 24 (VLCD = -11%, BDD = -2%). Reductions in weight and fat-free mass (FFM) were 12.1% and 3.6% for the VLCD patients and 10.6% and 4.1% for the BDD patients, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in pre- to posttreatment changes in REE normalized to FFM. Results suggest that REE recovers partially after consumption of a VLCD. They also provide evidence of a possible metabolic advantage of weight loss by a more moderate restriction.\r"

However, manifestations of overt toxicity symptoms (nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, lethargy, and fatigue) will occur with extremely high zinc intakes. At low intakes, but at amounts well in excess of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (100-300 mg Zn/d vs an RDA of 15 mg Zn/d), evidence of induced copper deficiency with attendant symptoms of anemia and neutropenia, as well as impaired immune function and adverse effects on the ratio of low-density-lipoprotein to high-density-lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) cholesterol have been reported. Even lower levels of zinc supplementation, closer in amount to the RDA, have been suggested to interfere with the utilization of copper and iron and to adversely affect HDL cholesterol concentrations. Individuals using zinc supplements should be aware of the possible complications attendant to their use.\r"

Much remains to be learned about amino acid-dependent changes in mRNA synthesis, processing, turnover, and translation. The relationships between protein and amino acid intake and components of whole-body protein and amino acid kinetics are considered with reference to nutritional adaptation and accommodation. The limit of adaptation to protein intake cannot be lowered substantially beyond that for healthy adults whose habitual protein intake is generous.

Because there is a large variation worldwide in the availability of dietary calcium (300-1500 g/d for man) and because there is a changing physiological need throughout life (growth, puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause) for absorption of 50-500 mg/d of dietary calcium, it is essential that the process of intestinal calcium absorption be adaptable and responsive to both the dietary and physiological circumstances. This article reviews the evidence that this adaptation process is largely orchestrated by the vitamin D endocrine system. In this model the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol has been shown to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption by both genomic (receptor mediated) and nongenomic (transcaltachia mediated) mechanisms.\r"

The lower limit of the adapted state is best defined by serum ferritin greater than or equal to 12 micrograms/L, because lower values indicate that iron stores are fully depleted. Successful adaptation is achieved by modifying the rate of gastrointestinal absorption according to body iron needs. Several dietary variables, including total intake, content of heme, and bioavailability of nonheme iron, determine the ceiling of the adaptive response when iron demands are high. With lesser demands the nature of the diet has a limited influence on body iron reserves, although there is some evidence that the adaptive response to variations in heme iron intake is less complete than the response to differences in nonheme bioavailability. How the intestinal mucosal cell achieves adaptation is one of the most important unsolved questions in iron metabolism.\r"

Distinction is made between behavioral adaptation mechanisms, which include only actions taken after weight loss and directly resulting in immediate reduction of energy intake, and those actions that are taken in anticipation of a forth-coming energy stress and do not necessarily reduce energy expenditure.\r"

It is concluded that mass immunization of high-risk populations during outbreaks, while effective, is difficult to justify scientifically because only a small percentage of subjects are not immune. If facilities permit, mass screening during outbreaks may be feasible. Preferably, continuous screening and vaccination of susceptible high-risk employees could be performed. Our study also does not validate exclusion from immunization programs those born prior to 1957 in view of the fact that both seronegativity and disease occur in this age group with significant frequency.\r"

  ".W": "Fragments of tissue, intermediate targets, and debris related to firing are embedded in the fine striations and deforming edges of bullets. Because most of these fragments are too small to visualize and process as histologic sections, this material is usually washed away when the projectiles are cleaned following removal at autopsy. By preserving the rinsing material that results from routine cleaning of projectiles, it may be possible to evaluate adherent material from the bullet by cytologic techniques, including filter preparations, cell blocks, and smears of macroscopic tissue fragments. Bullet-wash cytology produced cellular elements, tissue fragments, and inert material from intermediate targets. Different tissue elements could be documented with a given projectile; this information could be utilized to document the path of a bullet through the body or intermediate target. This initial study suggests that low- and high-velocity projectiles produce different types of tissue debris, with much more fragmentation and scarcity of cellular components in the high-velocity rounds. Inert material, resulting from intermediate targets, such as clothing, as well as gunshot residue on the bullet or debris from the barrel could be distinguished on preparations. There was a difference in tissue representation of adherent material on the bullet; connective tissue, mesothelial coverings, and fragments from organs with higher elastic and cohesive properties were seen with much greater frequency on the filters than were loosely cohesive and friable organs such as liver and spleen. The cytologic preparations from projectile washings reflect both the path taken by the bullet and the ballistic damage to the organs. Thus, the cytologic evaluation of bullet washings may be useful in the incorporation of gunshot wound evaluation to support documentation of the trajectory of the projectile.\r"

A less well-recognized, but no less important, responsibility of the medical examiner is the investigation of deaths of individuals who die at the workplace. The manner of death of most job-related fatalities has been traditionally classified as accidental. In recent times, prosecutors have scrutinized these cases more carefully. The results of some investigations have prompted them to bring criminal charges against employers for blatant negligence that contributed directly to injuries and deaths of employees. This paper is devoted to a review of the controversy surrounding the issue of industrial homicide, illustrative cases, and the role of the medical examiner in the investigation of deaths at the workplace.\r"

In accord with recent observations in Alzheimer's disease, significant numbers of beta-protein immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were observed in three cases. Most of these immunoreactive NFTs appeared to be tombstone tangles, although not all such tangles were stained. This immunoreaction was completely abolished by preincubation of antibodies with synthetic beta-protein peptides, and the identity of the immunostained NFTs was confirmed by polarization microscopy of sections counterstained with Congo red. However, it is not yet clear if the beta-protein antigens are, in fact, an integral part of paired helical filaments. These observations, together with our recent finding of beta-immunoreactive plaque-like lesions in dementia pugilistica, also emphasize the many similarities in pathology between this condition and Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In 12 of 14 cases of patch/plaque stage mycosis fungoides, the epidermal T cells were Ki-67 positive, while the dermal T cells were Ki-67 negative in all cases. Both epidermal and dermal T cells belonged primarily to the memory-versus-naive subset. The intraepidermal Ki-67-positive T cells were slightly larger than the dermal Ki-67-negative cells and could be easily distinguished from occasional basal keratinocytes that were also Ki-67 positive. We conclude that dermal T cells, despite expressing HLA-DR and a memory phenotype, are essentially in a resting (Go or noncycling state) in mycosis fungoides. Furthermore, it appears that the movement of T cells into the epidermal compartment is associated with activation and entry into the cell cycle. Such intraepidermal activation may lead to lymphokine release, and play an important pathophysiologic role in mycosis fungoides.\r"

The current study was conducted to examine the preservation of high-molecular-weight DNA in tissues processed by this method. DNA was extracted from AMeX-processed tissue sections after deparaffinization by the same method as that used to extract DNA from fresh tissues. The total amounts of DNA extracted from 10 mg each in wet weight of AMeX-processed and fresh mouse liver tissues were identical. In tissues of malignant lymphoma, the total amount of spooled DNA extracted from 50 sections, each 20 microns thick, was about 8 micrograms/mm2. The electrophoretic pattern of DNA digested with restriction endonucleases on agarose gel from AMeX-processed tissue sections did not differ from that of fresh materials. Southern blot hybridization analysis also revealed that the mobility of specific DNA fragments was identical for AMeX-processed and fresh tissues. The AMeX method was thus proved to be a versatile multipurpose tissue-processing procedure, which is expected to provide important information regarding the correlation between morphology, phenotypic expression, and gene alteration.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution and localization of thymocytes positive for p21 ras, the lymphocyte homing receptor antigen MEL-14, and IL-2 receptors were studied by immunohistology and flow cytometry. Comparisons were made between age-matched normal mice, carcinogen-treated mice at early (stage II) and late (stage III) stages of disease, and cortisone-treated mice. In normal thymus, the majority of cortical and medullary thymocytes are p21 ras positive. MEL-14hi- and IL-2R-positive cells are located in the cortex and comprise less than 5% of the thymus population. Stage II carcinogen-treated animals consistently show increased numbers of MEL-14hi cells in the thymus, with fewer animals having increased numbers of IL-2R positive cells. These populations appear to be different from one another. All stage III animals have MEL-14hi-positive tumor cells, which in 70% of the cases also express IL-2R. Cortisone treatment was used to study non-malignant proliferation. After cortisone treatment there is a marked increase of p21 ras staining in both the cortex and medulla during the first 72-hour interval. Within 24 hours, 50% of the thymocytes are IL-2R positive, but MEL-14hi cells are not detected. By 48 hours, 90% of the thymus population expresses IL-2R and 50% of the cells are MEL-14hi positive, and this results in a substantial population of cells positive for both IL-2R positive:MEL-14hi markers. This population rapidly disappears by 72 hours, leaving 90% of the cells MEL-14hi positive and less than 10% IL-2R positive. The staining of p21 ras at 72 hours is unusual, showing a speckled, cytoplasmic pattern. In light of our findings, we propose that the first step in thymic lymphomagenesis in carcinogen-treated C57BL/6 mice involves the rare cortical MEL-14hi subpopulation and is thymic dependent. A late stage involves expression of IL-2 receptors by a subset of MEL-14hi cells, thus conferring the potential for autonomous growth and malignancy.\r"

Both KCA-1+ and KCA-2+ cells were located predominantly in the periportal region; in contrast, Ia+ sinusoidal cells were located primarily in the centrilobular region. Macrophagelike cells within the portal tracts expressed KCA-2 but not KCA-1. These findings indicate the presence of heterogeneity within the macrophage population of the liver. Anti-KCA-1 reactivity appeared to be almost entirely restricted to Kupffer cells; only a few macrophages in the thymus and a small number of cells in the bone marrow expressed KCA-1. In contrast, KCA-2 was more widely distributed; splenic, lymph node, and intestinal macrophages were intensely stained with anti-KCA-2. These studies indicate that KCA-1 is a marker of Kupffer cells.\r"

  ".W": "The present study has examined the response of bovine platelets to surface activation and compared it to the reaction of human cells. Human platelets react to surfaces by losing their discoid shape, extending pseudopods, converting to dendritic forms, and finally, spreading into thin films resembling pancakes. Bovine platelets do not spread, they unfold. Surface activation causes them to transform from discs to irregular, flattened shapes resembling dendritic platelets, but they are unable to fill in spaces between pseudopods, a step required for spreading. Bovine platelets lack the surface-connected open canalicular system (OCS), which serves as a reservoir of membrane for human platelet spreading. Its absence may be the major factor in the failure of bovine platelet spreading, but there are other possible factors. Circumferential microtubules are more resistant to disassembly in surface-activated bovine than human cells, and their stability as rings or fractured bundles may limit spreading. Actin filament assembly is similar in human and bovine platelets, but the organization is different. Human platelets form a peripheral weave of actin that expands the membrane between pseudopods. A peripheral weave does not form in surface-activated bovine platelets. The absence of the OCS and differences in cytoskeletal organization in bovine platelets may also affect spreading of the surface membrane. Fibrinogen-gold (Fgn-Au) probes added to spread human platelet move from pseudopods and the cell margin toward the center and concentrate in the OCS. Fgn-Au particles bind to surface-activated bovine cells, but move very little, or not at all. All of these factors may contribute to the inability of bovine platelets to react to surfaces by spreading like human cells, but absence of the OCS appears to be the major cause.\r"

Light microscopy showed small necrotic foci with inflammatory cell infiltration spreading in the myocardium on days 3 to 7 and evidence of healing by day 9 after inoculation. Electron microscopy demonstrated that necrotic cell debris was phagocytosed by macrophages, and that degenerating cardiocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes were often in close contact, suggesting immunologic interactions, and that platelet thrombi were present in some capillaries on days 3 to 5. Both systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle (LV) were impaired on days 3 to 9 and recovered almost to normal by day 14. The virus could be isolated from the heart on days 3 to 7. Immunofluorescent preparations showed virus antigens in the vascular walls and cardiocytes until day 7. These results suggest that the acute cardiac injury was related to cytotoxic immunologic interactions, virus-induced cytolysis and, at least in part, to ischemia due to intracapillary thrombosis. Compared with coxsackie B3 myocarditis in mice, the influenza myocarditis was mild in degree and short in duration, but the influenza infection is a most common and repetitive disease in humans. The clinical implications of this animal model with myocarditis are discussed.\r"

To determine whether altered expression of ICAM-1 occurs in autoimmune lupus nephritis, we studied ICAM-1 expression in kidneys of normal and autoimmune MRL-lpr and (NZBX NZW)F1 (NZB/W) mice. By immunoperoxidase staining, ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels in proximal tubules (PT), endothelium and interstitial cells in normal C3H/FeJ mice. In nephritic MRL-lpr and NZB/W kidneys, staining for ICAM-1 is increased in the PT, particularly in the brush border, and is prominent in the glomerular mesangium and the endothelium of large vessels. By Western blot analysis, ICAM-1 is not detected in the urine of normal BALB/c and C3H/FeJ or autoimmune MRL-lpr. By Northern blot analysis, nephritic MRL-lpr and NZB/W have a two- to fivefold increase in steady state levels of ICAM-1 transcripts in the kidney as compared with normal or prenephritic mice. This is paralleled by an increase in MHC class II transcripts. In cultured PT cells, ICAM-1 is expressed at basal levels in PT and is increased by the cytokines interferon-gamma, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha. Thus cytokine-mediated upregulation of ICAM-1 in lupus nephritis may promote interaction of immune cells with renal tissue. The predominant apical expression of ICAM-1 opposite to the basolateral Ia expression suggests a novel role for this adhesion molecule in PT.\r"

The effect of the perfluorochemical, Fluosol-DA, and its various components on neutrophil adherence, cytotoxicity, and proteolytic enzyme release was examined on sheep large and small vessel endothelial cells in vitro. Cells were studied under normoxic (N) and anoxic conditions (A). Various concentrations of Fluosol (10%, 25%, and 50%) significantly reduced neutrophil adherence under both experimental conditions [mean 22 +/- 3.25% versus 7 +/- 0.8% (N) and 20 +/- 3.2% versus 7.5 +/- 0.9% (A); P less than 0.01]. The perfluorocarbons, perfluorodecalin (PFD), and perfluoro-tripropylamine (PFTP) in a 50 volume/percent concentration exhibited profound effects on adherence, particularly on cells subjected to anoxia (51% and 69% reduction in adherence, respectively; P less than 0.01). No effect on adherence was observed with other components, including the detergent, pluronic F68. A 25% reduction (P less than 0.02) in endothelial cytotoxicity was noted when neutrophils were preincubated with Fluosol. However, pretreatment of endothelial cells with Fluosol did not inhibit neutrophil adherence. Neutrophils stimulated with cytochalasin B and FMLP showed a significant reduction in lysozyme release after incubation with Fluosol (28 +/- 5% versus 17 +/- 4%; P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that Fluosol significantly attenuates neutrophil adherence, cytotoxicity, and enzyme release in an in vitro model of microvascular injury. It also suggests that prevention of neutrophil-mediated microvascular damage may be an important mechanism whereby Fluosol enhances myocardial salvage after ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Previously identified as a platelet-activating factor, 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine recently has been described as an inflammatory mediator with vasoactive and leukotactic properties. Histologic studies suggested that the local microvascular effects of this potent acetylated alkyl phosphoglyceride were limited in extent. Also, cytologic characterization of exudates was incomplete in tissue sections. Therefore, skin window chambers were used as an alternate model in which to explore the ability of the active form of this lipid mediator to diffuse in tissue. In addition, skin windows provided a convenient means to characterize the leukocytic exudates. Based on measurements of agonist-induced plasma exudation, the effect of 1-0-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine appeared to be limited to the superficial microvasculature underlying the skin window surface. This interpretation was supported by a brief histologic study that revealed vascular labeling by colloidal carbon mostly in a narrow 150-microns dermal zone beneath chambers containing the phospholipid agonist. Finally, the leukocytic exudate recovered at 3 hours consisted of neutrophils and a small number of eosinophils. Thus the skin window model was useful to further characterize the leukocytic exudate, and it suggested that the potent vasoactive effects of the acetylated alkyl phosphoglyceride were limited by local conditions in tissue so as to produce a highly focused inflammatory response.\r"

The race was run in the rain with a temperature of 46 degrees F. When the prerace and postrace values of the runners were compared, significant increases were noted in the serum sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), protein, plasma renin, vasopressin, and urinary potassium. Significant decreases were found in weight, blood pressure, and urinary sodium. No significant differences were noted in serum chloride, serum glucose, and hemoglobin/hematocrit. The mean weight loss of 1.9 kg was less than weight losses reported in marathons run under warmer conditions.\r"

Many of the findings of this investigation were consistent with previous studies and suggest particular injury trends in women's gymnastics. These results included injury location, injury severity, nature of onset, event, and activity at the time of injury. Some of the descriptive results, however, provided information that was heretofore unreported or inconsistent with previous investigations. These findings involved injury rate, reinjury rate, time loss, injury type, hours of practice, and incidence of physician-seen injuries. Some of these findings were disturbing and echo concerns registered in the professional literature. In particular, the reinjury rate is alarming and points to the need for complete rehabilitation before return to full participation. The results of the analytic component of the study alluded to the potential role of competitive level and maturation rate in the profile of the injury-prone gymnast. Specifically, rapid periods of growth and advanced levels of training and competition appeared to be related to injury proneness. Pursuant to the descriptive and analytic results of the investigation, recommendations for injury prevention and continued research are made.\r"

The reasons for these contrasting actions on the CNS are poorly understood at the present time. However, biologic variability plays an important role in determining individual patient's responses to anesthetic and analgesic drugs. In addition, variations in the responsiveness of inhibitory and excitatory neurons to the central depressant effects of these drugs could also explain these apparently conflicting data. Depending on the brain concentration, centrally active drugs may produce differing effects on the CNS inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems. The availability of increasingly powerful magnetic resonance imaging techniques to provide noninvasive information about tissue chemistry (e.g., neurotransmitters and citric acid cycle metabolites) and positron emission tomography to noninvasively evaluate CNS drug-receptor interactions should lead to a more in-depth understanding of the in vivo effects of anesthetics and analgesics on the CNS. In the second part of this review article, we discuss the pro- and anticonvulsant effects of the sedative-hypnotics, local anesthetics, and other anesthetic adjuvant drugs.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years double-blind trials have proved the effectiveness of nonsurgical therapy in the treatment of peripheral obstructive arterial disease (POAD). Among the non-pharmacologic measures taken, walking distance was increased by 40% in subjects who stopped smoking and by more than 100% in those who undertook physical exercise. Drug treatment reduces the atherosclerotic process and brings about an improvement in the symptoms of the disease. In subjects given hypolipidemic treatment the progression of the disease was reduced by two thirds. Two separate studies suggest that antiplatelet drugs, taken over a period of two to four years, significantly slow the progression of atherosclerosis in lower extremity arteries. In the treatment of claudication, two vasodilating drugs, naftidrofuryl and buflomedil, have shown a significant improvement in painfree walking distance and/or total walking distance, compared with treatment with placebo. Another effective approach is in the treatment of blood rheology through drugs such as pentoxifylline or by hemodilution. Double-blind trials with pentoxifylline demonstrated an average increase of 66% in maximum walking distance as compared with 22% with placebo. The effectiveness of hemodilution was demonstrated by two controlled trials, during which the reduction of the hematocrit to values of 40-42 for periods of four to six weeks increased both walking distance and resting blood flow. When introduced intraarterially in low doses in the vicinity of the occluding thrombus, thrombolytic agents have been found to be helpful in the treatment of acute and chronic POAD. This therapy should, however, be regarded as a substitute for surgical treatment only in high-risk patients. Further, after having produced the lysis of thrombi, the treatment permits the underlying parietal lesions to be accurately identified; at this point the appropriate therapy can be decided upon, either an operative procedure or a balloon dilation. In conclusion the many controlled clinical trials carried out over the past few years have clearly demonstrated that conservative treatment can alleviate clinical signs and symptoms in patients with claudication and pain at rest.\r"

  ".W": "The broad availability of new pharmacologic agents is usually followed by both the search for similar compounds with more specific and refined actions and the expansion of clinical applicability for these agents. During the last twenty years extensive investigations have revealed that calcium (Ca) antagonists hold a multifaceted pharmacodynamic potential that includes not only the antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive effects of the drug but also the protection against excessive Ca entry into the cells of the cardiovascular system and subsequent cell damage. The physiologic age-dependent Ca accumulation in the arterial wall, which inevitably appears after the second decade, reaches maximal values in the age group of eighty-one to ninety years when the aortic wall exhibits a total Ca content that is 100 times higher than in arteries of infants. In animals we also find age-dependent accumulation of Ca in the arterial wall that is severely aggravated by uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension. Fleckenstein has shown that this arterial calcinosis can be prevented by chronic administration of Ca antagonists. Furthermore, Fleckenstein has demonstrated that excessive Ca overload of myocardial tissue constitutes a basic pathologic process in the development of cardiac necroses--brought about by extreme beta-adrenergic drive (overdoses of catecholamines), high doses of vitamin D3, dihydrotachysterol, alimentary factors such as K or Mg deficiency, or genetic defects (hereditary cardiomyopathy). Even cardiac hypertrophy, either idiopathic or as a consequence of hypertension, can be prevented by the action of Ca antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 8 of these 12 patients duplex sonography revealed a stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) exceeding 50%. Frequency spectra of 10 patients showed a satisfactory quality and were analyzed. In 7 subjects balloon inflation was well tolerated and systolic blood pressure did not drop below 75 mmHg. In these patients, whether they had a stenosis of the ICA or not, blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) did not decrease to a critical level. The authors defined \"critical\" as a reduction of mean blood flow velocity in the MCA exceeding 50% or a decrease below 35 cm/sec. Three patients showed a rapid decrease of systolic aortic pressure below 75 mmHg. In these subjects mean blood flow velocity in the MCA dropped to levels below 35 cm/sec. Deflation and retraction of the balloon resulted in a rapid increase of systemic blood pressure and flow velocity in the MCA. This report demonstrates TCD to be a useful monitoring method of determining residual perfusion in patients with aortic stenosis during PTAV.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional echo cardiographic wall motion scores are potentially valuable prognostic indicators because of their association with subsequent mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Because wall motion scores are relatively simple to obtain, they could come into widespread use. But wall motion scores have been found to have a low positive predictive accuracy in respect to one- or three-year survival and a low specificity in respect to pump failure. To clarify the value of wall motion scores in risk stratification the authors analyzed the ability of a wall motion index, in combination with other variables, to predict death within a year of acute myocardial infarction. Patients were 149 consecutive men with acute myocardial infarction. There were no exclusion criteria. By Cox regression, the variables most closely related to survival were the presence of a pericardial effusion, the age of the patient, alcoholism, and the E point septal separation. The wall motion index, by comparison, was only weakly related to survival and was therefore dropped from further analyses. The four variables most closely related to survival were then used to derive a predictive echocardiographic score. The score's negative predictive accuracy was 94%, although sensitivity and positive predictive accuracy were low. These data suggest that, even when applied nonselectively, the echocardiographic score, but not the wall motion index, appears to be an efficient way of characterizing the outcome of acute myocardial infarction, in that it reliably detects low-risk patients.\r"

Reperfusion was detected in 31 patients (67%) by clinical, electrocardiographic, and enzymatic criteria. The mean time elapsed between the onset of the chest pain to thrombolytic therapy was 114 +/- 53 minutes. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly better in patients with anterior and inferior myocardial infarction who had successful reperfusion, as compared with those who did not (48.8 +/- 13.0 vs 35.3 +/- 10.9, p less than 0.05 and 59.7 +/- 12.6 vs 47.9 +/- 15.3, p less than 0.05, respectively). The rate of reocclusion within three weeks was 22%. The overall one-year mortality was 4%. There were no serious adverse reactions following the thrombolytic treatment. Thus bolus IV injection of 30 units of APSAC is both safe and effective in preserving left ventricular function when given early in the course of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Despite this, traditional recommendations have supported debridement, admission, and aggressive wound care in these patients. This study will determine the effect of two methods of wound care on the outcome of soft-tissue gunshot wounds. Patients who had suffered a gunshot wound and were transported to the Trauma Center at the University of Florida Health Science Center postinjury were considered eligible for this study. All patients with torso injury, skeletal injury, neurovascular injury, or vascular proximity were excluded. Patients were then randomized to two treatment regimens based on a previously determined scheme. All wound care, follow-up, and healing evaluations were performed by the same individual. A total of 163 patients met the study criteria and they were randomized to the two treatment regimens: 89 patients, debridement and wound care; 74 patients, wound care alone. Each group was similar in age, sex, time to treatment, and caliber/velocity. Patients available for follow-up were similar in each group. Four patients in the wound-debridement group and two patients in the conservative wound-care group developed superficial infections. All infections responded to prompt local therapy. This study supports the conservative treatment of soft-tissue injury from low-velocity gunshot wounds.\r"

The use of this biofragmentable anastomosis ring (BAR) was compared with conventional techniques in a prospective, randomized study of 59 patients (x age, 49 years) undergoing ileocolostomy (n = 23) or colocolostomy (n = 36). The anastomotic technique was determined at surgery by randomization (BAR, 27 patients; suture, 16 patients; staple, 16 patients). Performance of an anastomosis with the BAR required an average of 22 minutes, a stapled anastomosis required 33 minutes, and the suture technique required 37 minutes. Learning curve error contributed to the six intraoperative complications that occurred with performance of the anastomosis (BAR, three; end-to-end anastomosis [EEA] instrument, three). The two postoperative deaths were unrelated to the anastomosis. Length of hospitalization in uncomplicated patients was the same among the three groups. The 17 patients with prolonged hospitalization had complications unrelated to anastomotic technique. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks; no additional complications were identified. We concluded that 1) the BAR is a rapid, safe method for performance of sutureless anastomoses; 2) perioperative mortality and morbidity rates of the BAR are comparable to conventional techniques of suture and staple; and 3) long-term follow-up of BAR patients is warranted to determine the incidence of complications, such as structure and/or stenosis.\r"

Correct diagnosis cannot be made by clinical examination; therefore, an objective test for accurate assessment becomes necessary. Contrast venography is recognized as the gold standard examination. However, the disadvantages of venography including radiation, dye exposure, and cost are also well recognized. These disadvantages have led to the development of the noninvasive studies. To evaluate Duplex B-mode ultrasound, Doppler, and air plethysmography, a retrospective review of patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation of deep venous thrombosis was performed. From June 1984 until June 1987, 1,870 patients were examined in the laboratory. Forty eight of these patients underwent all three noninvasive tests as well as contrast venography. There were 16 men and 32 women with a mean age of 60. A total of 50 limbs was examined in these patients. The noninvasive tests had the following sensitivities as compared with venography: Doppler 71 per cent, air plethysmography 71 per cent, and Duplex B-mode ultrasound 95 per cent. These results were statistically significant at P less than 0.05. The specificities for Doppler, air plethysmography, and Duplex B-mode ultrasound were 90 per cent, 83 per cent, and 100 per cent, respectively. These results were also statistically significant at P less than 0.02. Based on these findings, we conclude that Duplex B-mode ultrasound is a superior noninvasive examination as compared with air plethysmography or Doppler, and is a reliable, economical, and efficient substitute for contrast venography.\r"

Patients demonstrated a wide range of analgesic requirement in the first 24 hours but the average of the total analgesic required was higher in the PCA group (average, 29.5 mg) than the traditional group (22.8 mg). Urinary complications occurred more commonly in the group of patients receiving traditional analgesia than in the group of patients receiving analgesia with the PCA device. When compared with patients receiving analgesia by traditional methods, patients receiving the PCA infusion required more analgesia with fewer urinary complications and similar postoperative length of stay.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of Hemoccult II tests for detecting colorectal neoplasm (colorectal carcinoma or polyp or both). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective analyses of asymptomatic patients (greater than or equal to 45 years) followed for 4 years after screening with Hemoccult II testing and retrospective analyses of patients, with known colorectal carcinoma or polyps or both who had Hemoccult II testing within 2 years of diagnosis. SETTING: A large, health maintenance organization practice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the prospective analysis, the sensitivity of Hemoccult II was 50% for colorectal carcinoma diagnosed within 1 year of testing, 43% within 2 years, and 25% within 4 years. For polyps, sensitivity was 36% at 1 year, 28% at 2 years, and 17% at 4 years. Specificity was 99%. The predictive value of a positive test for colorectal carcinoma was 8% at 1 year, 10% at 2 years, and 11% at 4 years. On the basis of the retrospective analyses, the sensitivity of Hemoccult II for colorectal carcinoma diagnosed within 1 year of testing was 66% and was 61% within 2 years. Many of these patients had symptoms when tested. CONCLUSIONS: An asymptomatic patient age 45 or older with a positive Hemoccult II test has about a chance of 1 in 10 for having colorectal carcinoma and a 1-in-3 chance of having either a colorectal carcinoma or polyp: The same patient with a negative Hemoccult test has a 0.2% chance of having a colorectal carcinoma diagnosed within 2 years of testing and a 0.7% chance of having a polyp. Within 4 years of testing the chance increases to 0.5% for colorectal carcinoma and 1.5% for polyps. If Hemoccult II slides are the only screening method used for detecting asymptomatic colorectal neoplasms, 50% to 60% of lesions will remain undetected. Clinical interpretation of Hemoccult screening requires appreciation of its limits as well as its benefits.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the clinical picture, pathogenesis, and management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published since 1970 were identified from a MEDLINE search, articles accumulated by the authors, and through bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Information for review was taken from 160 of the more than 200 articles examined. DATA EXTRACTION: Pertinent studies were selected; the relative strengths and weaknesses of these studies are discussed. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies in tissue and organ cultures suggest that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on bone, causing inhibition of bone formation and enhancing bone resorption. Glucocorticoids decrease calcium absorption from the intestine and increase renal excretion. Osteoporosis occurs in at least 50% of persons who require long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Long-term trials of therapy for the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis have not been done, but reasonable recommendations include the use of a glucocorticoid with a short half-life in the lowest dose possible, maintenance of physical activity, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, sodium restriction and use of thiazide diuretics, and gonadal hormone replacement. In refractory cases, the use of calcitonin, bisphosphonates, sodium fluoride, or anabolic steroids should be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis is common in patients requiring long-term treatment with glucocorticoids. Careful attention to preventive management may minimize the severity of this serious complication.\r"

Despite the extensive modification of cows' milk to make an infant formula resemble human breast milk, the results are very similar to those previously reported with unmodified cows' milk baby feeds. The exact dietary factor responsible for these microbiological differences is unclear and in succeeding papers we have looked at the effects of protein quality, in particular the content of whey proteins, casein, and lactoferrin.\r"

  ".W": "The faecal flora of breast fed babies differs from that of bottle fed babies. We have shown that the use of a whey predominant formula rather than a casein predominant one induced a faecal flora generally closer to that of breast fed babies but substantial differences remained. The whey proteins of breast milk include much more lactoferrin than is found in cows' milk. Observations both in animals and in vitro suggest that lactoferrin could be responsible for some of these differences between bottle and breast fed babies. This study was designed to determine the effects on faecal flora of the addition of bovine lactoferrin to the diet of bottle fed babies while holding other qualities of their diet constant. As lactoferrin is an iron binding protein three test formulas were used: (a) no added iron and no added lactoferrin (basic), (b) no iron but added lactoferrin (L), and (c) added iron and lactoferrin (LF). The addition of lactoferrin had little effect upon the faecal microflora and did not move the pattern of the faecal flora in the direction of the breast fed baby. The addition of iron to the formula had more effect on the faecal flora than did lactoferrin. At day 4 it encouraged Escherichia coli and discouraged staphylococcal faecal colonisation. At day 14 the addition of iron to the formula discouraged bifidobacteria. The reasons why bovine lactoferrin was ineffective in vivo in this study are discussed.\r"

Although not a perfect discriminatory test, knemometry is a more reliable and less invasive way of analysing the likely value of a growth promoting treatment than metabolic assays in individual patients. Given the possible future rapid expansion of the use of somatropin in short stature of various aetiologies there is a need for a relatively simple and inexpensive means of evaluating response to treatment.\r"

This considerably reduced the amount of handling of the infant compared with conventional assessment. Captured data were analysed and displayed graphically at the cotside. The system is applicable for use on infants over a wide range of gestational ages and may give information on the complex haemodynamic changes occurring in the cerebral circulation.\r"

Intraobserver reproducibility was investigated in 12 infants using the suprasternal site for measuring blood flow velocity. The most reproducible determination of cardiac output was found when the suprasternal site with continuous wave Doppler was used for measurement of blood flow velocity and M mode trailing edge to leading edge echocardiography was used for diameter. Normal mean (2 SD) cardiac output is 231 (77) ml/kg/min. Technical difficulties in measuring aortic diameter accurately limit direct comparison between infants.\r"

In normal fetuses it was fairly constant throughout pregnancy, but of those with congenital heart disease it was raised in cases of Ebstein's anomaly, tricuspid dysplasia, atrioventricular septal defect, and complete heart block. In some forms of congenital heart disease, however, it was within the normal range. There was a significant positive correlation between the cardiothoracic ratio and fetal hydrops in the group of 15 fetuses with supraventricular tachycardias. In these fetuses the cardiac size decreased significantly once the fetus reverted to sinus rhythm after the mother had been treated. Measurement of the cardiothoracic ratio is essential in the evaluation of fetal hydrops, as an increased value may point to the diagnosis of an intermittent fetal tachycardia if the fetus is assessed during a period of sinus rhythm. The measurement of this index forms a part of the complete prenatal evaluation of structural heart disease. The degree of cardiomegaly may provide useful information about secondary lung compression or cardiac failure and therefore assist in giving an accurate prognosis for postnatal survival.\r"

At the time of analysis, 201 of these patients were free from malignancy 60 months after operation. Thirty percent of patients who died were free from malignancy at death. Death rates were comparable for the total group (907 patients) and the patients free from malignancy at 60 months (201 patients) (0.086 versus 0.079, respectively); therefore death was not a suitable therapeutic end point. Cancer recurrences were more frequent in patients with non-squamous carcinoma than those with squamous carcinoma (0.088 versus 0.042); however, this difference was not observed after a 60-month malignancy-free interval (0.035 versus 0.022, respectively). Select comparisons between the total group of 907 patients and the 201 patients free from malignancy at 60 months are noteworthy: (1) the rate of occurrence of new, nonpulmonary malignancies was constant (0.016 versus 0.018, respectively); (2) the rate of pulmonary recurrences decreased (0.043 versus 0.013, respectively); and (3) the rate of occurrence of new lung cancer increased (0.009 versus 0.016, respectively). Therefore, although cancer recurrences decreased with survival, new lung cancer occurrences increased, and the probability of malignant disease appearing more than 60 months after operation for T1 N0 non-small cell lung cancer dictates continued patient surveillance.\r"

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the argon beam electrocoagulator for performing pulmonary wedge resections in an animal model by comparing it with standard electrocautery and suture closure. Variables used to compare the three methods of resection included perioperative blood loss, duration of chest tube air leak, and depth of necrosis and severity of inflammatory reaction in the lung at ten days and 3 weeks after resection. The argon beam electrocoagulator was as effective as standard electrocautery and suture closure in controlling air leaks, and caused less acute tissue injury than standard electrocautery. The argon beam electrocoagulator provides a safe and effective method for performing small pulmonary wedge resections, and should be evaluated in the clinical setting for this purpose.\r"

Walton Lillehei introduced the technique of cross circulation for the first-ever total corrections of ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and atrioventricular canal. Ten of 45 patients operated on with this technique of cardiopulmonary bypass had correction of tetralogy of Fallot, and the results with these 10 patients were reported in a landmark article. The operative results achieved in 1954 and 1955 by Lillehei and his team using cross circulation were truly remarkable. In addition, the University of Minnesota team concomitantly developed a host of new techniques and biomedical devices that made subsequent cardiac operative procedures safer and simpler to perform. These techniques and devices included the first ventricular septal defect prosthetic patch, the first right ventricular outflow patch, the first clinically applicable bubble oxygenator, and the first intramyocardial electrode used in combination with an external pacemaker for a patient with complete heart block.\r"

  ".W": "Using cyclosporin A, long-term survival after heart-lung transplantation became possible. The drug blocks the immune system more selectively and leaves the tracheal wound healing unimpaired. Since 1981, 501 clinical cases have been collected by the registry of the International Society for Heart Transplantation. Candidates for heart-lung transplantation reveal signs of irreversible heart and lung diseases that may have been caused by cardiac lesions (valvular diseases, Eisenmenger reaction due to congenital malformations) or by pulmonic disorders (primary pulmonary hypertension, emphysema, fibrosis). The standard surgical procedure, which combines donor and recipient tracheas, right atria, and aortas, makes three anastomoses necessary. Immunosuppressive regimen includes cyclosporin A (blood trough levels of 300 to 500 ng/mL), azathioprine (1 to 2 mg/kg), and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (1 to 4 mg immunoglobulin G/kg). After the first two postoperative weeks, rabbit antithymocyte globulin is replaced by methylprednisolone (0.3 to 0.1 mg/kg; 500 mg are given intravenously after opening the aortic cross-clamp; 3 x 125 mg on postoperative day 1). After heart-lung transplantation an extreme variety of problems may evolve. Early postoperative complications (within the first postoperative month) comprise acute isolated lung rejection, multiorgan failure, and bacterial pneumonia. Diagnosis of acute lung rejection proves difficult; it includes clinical signs, chest radiographic appearances, and cytoimmunological monitoring. Transbronchial lung biopsies are of similar value for precise diagnosis as are endomyocardial specimens after heart transplantation. Late postoperative complications (after 1 postoperative month) comprise viral pneumonia, fungal infection, tuberculosis, and chronic obliterative bronchiolitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of lactate infusion studies to date suggests that patients with panic attacks are significantly more sensitive to lactate than are healthy controls or patients with other psychiatric disorders without panic attacks. However, the usefulness of lactate infusion is limited by the lack of standardized, objective criteria for lactate-induced panic and uncertainty as to the sensitivity and specificity of the test for current, clinically significant panic attacks. Except in rare cases, the clinical history is likely to be of more value than lactate response in diagnosing panic disorder. Determination of the role of the test in subtyping patients with panic disorder awaits further study of the diagnostic, prognostic, genetic, and pathophysiologic significance of lactate sensitivity.\r"

One manufacturer's testing system accounted for most of the specificity problems. The sensitivity of the enzyme immunoassay for anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is close to 99%, based on the multiple reactive samples used on the 16 panels. Between 1985 and 1989, there was a 14-fold increase in participants reporting Western blot results. The introduction of a licensed system for Western blots increased the number of samples that contained antibody to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 interpreted as indeterminate. Answers to supplementary questions showed that the rate of repeatably reactive and confirmed positives on blood donors dropped to less than 0.1%.\r"

In 1983 when it clearly became evident that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome could be transmitted by transfusions of blood components and products, blood banks became the focus of intense scrutiny by the public as well as by the mass media. Suddenly it was known that people could contract acquired immunodeficiency syndrome even though they had not engaged in activities known to place them at increased risk for acquiring infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In many ways the general fear evoked was, and remains, disproportionate to the risks posed by transfusions. This fear coupled with a general distrust of blood banks may also be reflected in the legal response to people infected with human immunodeficiency syndrome type 1 through transfusions. Further, whether the fault system of our tort law is an appropriate way to determine compensation for people injured by transfusion has been brought into question. For those people injured prior to our recognition of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the failings of the current system are most obvious.\r"

Each step is important for reducing the number of units collected from donors who are at risk for HIV infection. Although HIV antibody test kit sensitivity exceeds 99%, recently infected persons who are in the \"window\" between infection and seroconversion are not detected. \"Worst scenario\" estimates indicate that 1 of 36,000 to 1 of 300,000 components may be collected from donors who have false-negative test results. Since some risk of infection transmission remains, physicians must prescribe transfusion therapy only when the benefit outweighs the potential risk.\r"

Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus was nearly eliminated by heating concentrates in the lyophilized state, which has been done since 1983. However, human immunodeficiency virus infections were still transmitted by some products \"dry heated\" under conditions less extreme than 68 degrees C for 72 hours. Newer virus-inactivating procedures include \"dry heating\" at 80 degrees C for 72 hours, modified heating in n-heptane or water vapor, heating in solution, treatment with solvent-detergent mixtures, monoclonal affinity purification plus inactivation, and alkylation with beta-propiolactone (only for factor IX complex). These procedures have eliminated significant loads of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and non-A, non-B hepatitis virus in laboratory studies. However, clinical studies have shown transmission of hepatitis non-A, non-B for products \"dry heated\" except at 80 degrees C and for products heated in n-heptane. Elimination of hepatitis B has been difficult to demonstrate, suggesting a continued need for immunization.\r"

The hypothesis that carcinoembryonic antigen enhances metastasis by promoting the attachment of tumor cells to Kupffer cells and hepatocytes was tested in an experimental metastasis model in which colorectal carcinoma cells were injected into the spleens of BALB/c athymic nude mice and liver colonies counted 5 weeks later. Pretreatment with systemic injections of carcinoembryonic antigen significantly increased the metastatic potential of a poorly metastatic colorectal carcinoma cell line KM-12c, but did not induce the nonmetastatic colorectal carcinoma cell line HC 2998 to produce metastases, nor did carcinoembryonic antigen make the highly metastatic colorectal carcinoma cell line mHC 1410 more metastatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen did not stimulate proliferation of colorectal carcinoma but appeared to be a cofactor for metastasis possibly as an adhesion factor.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the phorbol diester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), causes differentiation of the human colon carcinoma cell line, SW 48. Under routine growth conditions, the cells are round, have a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and lack cytoplasmic vacuoles. After treatment for 1 hour with 100 nmol/L of PMA at 37 degrees C, the cells assumed a spread-out, flasklike shape, displayed a low nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and exhibited cytoplasmic vacuoles. An inert but lipophilic phorbol diester, 4 phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, failed to induce these morphological changes. Cell kinetic studies showed that whereas SW 48 cells have a doubling time of 35 hours, those incubated with 100 nmol/L of PMA have a doubling time of 90 hours. Although the flow cytometry histograms were similar until 8 hours into the cell cycle, the PMA-treated cells ultimately spent proportionately less time in S and more in G2/M. Finally, under routine growth conditions, SW 48 cells express neither carcinoembryonic antigen nor G7 antigen. These antigens, which are present on the surface of well-differentiated cells, were expressed after treatment of SW 48 with PMA. The data suggest that PMA causes profound changes in structure, cell growth kinetics, and antigen expression, consistent with induction of differentiation of the cell line SW 48.\r"

Major objectives were to determine tolerance of therapy and its effects on tumor control and survival. After undergoing biopsy, patients received intra-arterial infusion with doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) (30 mg every 24 hours) for 3 days and were allocated by institution to receive irradiation of 30 or 35 Gy in 10 fractions or 46 Gy in 23 to 25 fractions. Surgery was done within 7 to 10 days or 30 days pending irradiation dose. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 31 patients. There were 60 patients, 29 women and 31 men with a median age of 48 years, with 53 soft-tissue tumors and 7 malignant bone tumors. Stages (American Joint Committee on Cancer) included stage IB, 2 patients; stages IIA and IIB, 9 patients; stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC, 39 patients; and stages IVA or IVB, 10 patients. Limb salvage surgery was done in 57 patients, including radical resection in 23 with large extensive tumors, wide local excision in 30, excision with narrow margins in 7, primary amputation in 3, and delayed amputation in 2 because of wound complications. There was one local recurrence in the 57 patients who had limb salvage surgery. Disease-free and overall survival at 48 months were 47% and 56%, respectively. We conclude that combined therapy for extremity sarcomas in a multicenter setting resulted in excellent local control, good function, and reasonable long-term survival in patients having limb salvage surgery.\r"

The two factors predicting greater drainage were large numbers of positive lymph nodes and no previous surgical biopsy (as in one-step procedure).\r"

In earlier work using a rat muscle preparation, insulin inhibition of proteolysis decreased in the presence of plasma from injured patients. The current experiments tested the effect of plasma from septic patients on insulin inhibition in the same model. The mean value of protein degradation among eight septic plasma samples was 49% greater than the mean value among five normal plasma samples in soleus muscle and 45% greater in extensor digitorum longus muscle. In the presence of insulin, 10(3) mU/L, the increases in degradation with septic plasma were 42% in soleus muscle and 48% in extensor digitorum longus muscle. Insulin reduced degradation an average of 6% (soleus) and 10% (extensor digitorum longus) in normal plasma and 10% (soleus) and 8% (extensor digitorum longus) in septic plasma. In contrast to results of other studies, these experiments show that the protective effect of a moderate concentration of insulin in resisting muscle protein degradation is not significantly different in the muscle protein degradation is not significantly different in the presence of septic human plasma compared with normal plasma. This finding supports clinical efforts to decrease proteolysis in septic patients by the administration of insulin.\r"

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the gastrointestinal tract is not a passive organ and that intestinal dysfunction is not limited to ileus and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Instead, the gastrointestinal tract is recognized as having important endocrine, metabolic, immunologic, and barrier functions, as well as its traditional role in nutrient absorption. Over the last 5 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of intestinal barrier failure in the development of systemic infection and multiple organ failure in the critically ill or injured patient.\r"

This essay discusses the research on the validity of demographic variables and the recommendations for their legal use in selecting students for medical school. The relationships of age, gender, size of hometown, parental education, parental occupation, parental income, and marital status to medical school outcomes of preclinical performances, clinical performance, attrition, specialty choice, and practice location are summarized. [Race or ethnic group is discussed in a separate essay in this issue.] Although the authors focus on the predictive value of demographic variables, these variables play a more important role as the moderator variables for other predictors of medical school outcomes. The full value of using demographic variables derives from data obtained in local validity studies. To comply with the equal-protection and due-process requirements, admission officers must assure that the use of demographic information in the admission process is explicit in bulletins given to applicants and is uniformly applied in the evaluation of all applicants.\r"

The performance data examined were basic science grades; clinical science grades; scores on National Board of Medical Examiners examinations, Parts I, II, and III; and information on academic difficulty. Methodological sources of differences in validity data, including restriction in range, criterion attenuation, and method specificity, are discussed. Reported validity data affirm the substantial value of traditional academic predictors of performance in medical school. Selection committees should, nevertheless, supplement academic data with nonacademic and interview information. Their inclusion is particularly important for minority and disadvantaged applicants. Medical schools should assess the validity of their selection systems. Additional research on the relations between academic predictors and performance-based indexes of clinical competence and on the role of traditional predictors with regard to the recently declining medical school applicant pool is suggested.\r"

Traditional predictors (college grades and scores on the Medical College Admission Test) have modest correlations with medical school grades and scores on the National Board of Medical Examiners examination for minority students. Nonetheless, admission committees also consider nontraditional variables when selecting minority students. Measures of nontraditional variables seem to assess types of intelligence not covered by traditional means. A system of organizing nontraditional or noncognitive variables into eight dimensions is proposed. The dimensions are self-concept, realistic, self-appraisal, understanding and dealing with racism, long-range goals, having a strong support person, showing leadership, having community involvement, and nontraditional knowledge acquired. Further, assessment should place more emphasis on recognizing and defining problems and on performance rather than knowledge. Combining traditional and nontraditional methods is best in selecting minority students, and sufficiently well developed measures exist in each area to make this a practical recommendation for any admission program.\r"

A critical component of this review is the selection interview, since it is an integral part of most admission processes; however, some question its value. Interviews serve four purposes: information gathering, decision making, verification of application data, and recruitment. The first and last of these merit special attention. The interview enables an admission committee to gather information about a candidate that would be difficult or impossible to obtain by any other means yet is readily evaluated in an interview. Given the recent decline in numbers of applicants to and interest in medical school, many schools are paying closer attention to the interview as a powerful recruiting tool. Interviews can be unstructured, semistructured, or structured. Structuring involves analyzing what makes a medical student successful, standardizing the questions for all applicants, providing sample answers for evaluating responses, and using panel interviews (several interviewers simultaneously with one applicant). Reliability and validity of results increase with the degree of structuring. Studies of interviewers show that they are often biased in terms of the rating tendencies (for instance, leniency or severity) and in terms of an applicant's sex, race, appearance, similarity to the interviewer, and contrast to other applicants). Training interviewers may reduce such bias. Admission committees should weigh the purposes of interviewing differently for various types of candidates, develop structured or semistructured interviews focusing on nonacademic criteria, and train the interviewers.\r"

Together, the articles review the literature, analyze the findings, and recommend sound practices and areas of future research germane to selecting students. The discussions highlight the predictor role, initial importance, and relatively short half-life of academic criteria in physicians' total careers, and emphasize that academic predictors must be complemented by other factors in the applicant's background. Because selection for medical school leads in almost all cases to eventual practice as a physician, the admission decision has far-reaching impact. Those concerned with the admission process should use the distilled information in these articles to improve the assessment of applicants and the selection process.\r"

Forty-six percent of 770 eligible couples responded to the questionnaire; data from 314 couples were used in this study. Sixty-five percent of the medical students were men. Eighty-five percent of the partners were employed outside the home. The partner was the most influential person in the students' choice of a residency. Twenty-six percent (81) of the couples mutually made the decision and over 50% (186) tried to satisfy equally both partners' needs. However, the women medical students had less influence over the decision and were more apt to sacrifice their needs for their partners' (p less than .05). The women students were also significantly less satisfied with their role in the decision-making process (p less than .05). Attention to these issues by both medical students and residency programs could help couples deal with the stresses involved in choosing a residency location.\r"

Between group comparisons revealed significant differences favorably comparing captopril to both methyldopa and propranolol in regard to fatigue, and blurred vision, as well as to methyldopa alone for dry mouth and \"feeling worn out.\" There were significant differences as well between captopril and propranolol with patients on propranolol worsening in bradycardia. Other comparisons of patients on propranolol and methyldopa monotherapy showed propranolol patients worsening in bradycardia and loss of taste, but methyldopa patients reported more dry mouth and feeling worn out than those on propranolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to therapy worsened total physical symptom distress scores for methyldopa and propranolol patients. This study confirms the value of methods which assess the degree of distress associated with symptoms commonly reported by hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medications. This approach can be useful in establishing a treatment regimen least likely to cause distress and can be of value in preserving quality of life, preventing noncompliance, and withdrawal from treatment.\r"

The majority of these have failed. The use of a placebo helps minimize bias, though most studies here simply compared a test drug with the old drug. Short-acting drugs can have their duration of effect prolonged by giving larger doses than necessary. In order to produce more meaningful data, the Food and Drug Administration gathered together a group of experts who collectively proposed a set of Guidelines for studying these drugs. Though the final version has not yet been issued, investigators and clinicians working with this class of drugs are vitally interested in these guidelines, and have already encountered several problems. We identify some of these problems and propose some solutions.\r"

  ".W": "An integrated approach, progressively implemented in the ARTEMIS system since 1975, is described for the computerized management of hypertensive patients. From a medical point of view, computerized programs can be used to memorize patients' individual records and profiles, to facilitate patient management and follow-up, to store medical knowledge about hypertension and to provide facilities for decision making at the level either of the individual patient or of the population followed up. From a technical point of view, the methodology used integrates data and knowledge management facilities into the same software. Five hypertension clinics are presently using the system in France and more than 22,000 records have been registered. Answer rates to 12 mandatory questions regarding past history and examination at first visit were superior to 95% in 19,601 records created between January 1976 and December 1987. Patient database interrogation can be used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of secondary hypertension, and to predict, for each patient, his/her cardiovascular risk, the risk of drop-out, the risk of insufficient blood pressure control and the probable blood pressure level. It also serves to test the content and validity of the associated expert system which is progressively built up. A prospective evaluation of the performance of the expert system on 80 cases of hypertension showed overall agreement between the specialists and the expert system ranging from 58 to 91% depending on the decision.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, all of these imaging techniques involve exposure of patients to ionizing radiation and, in the case of angiography, an invasive procedure. The use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of thoracic arterial disease is well documented and, more specifically, has been found to be useful in the diagnosis of innominate artery compression of the trachea and congenital vascular rings. This report documents the use of magnetic resonance imaging at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, in the diagnosis of innominate artery compression of the trachea. In addition, the radiographic appearance of this entity is contrasted with other compressive lesions of the trachea.\r"

Mice bred in germ-free, specific pathogen-free, and conventional conditions were used to examine nonimmunized middle ear mucosa. Middle ear mucosae of otitis media-induced mice were also examined. In normal middle ear mucosa, mast cells were substantial, followed by Mac-1-positive cells and lymphocytes. Even though IgA-, IgM-, and Lyt-1-positive cells were seen in the mucosa of conventional mice, IgM-positive cells were seen only in mucosae of specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice. In otitis media-induced mice by inoculation with nontypable Haemophilus influenzae or lipopolysaccharide, Mac-1-positive cells were dominant. Although the numbers of IgM- and Lyt-1-positive cells increased markedly, the numbers of other lymphocyte subsets did not increase until 14 days after inoculation. These findings suggest that the middle ear is immunologically a potential organ as long as it is not exposed to antigenic stimulation. It is considered to be an immunoreactive site only after it has been activated with pathogens.\r"

Using indirect immunofluorescence and the immunoperoxidase technique, FA-2 was found to be in the lamina densa/sublamina densa region of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) in adult as well as in foetal skin. FA-2 was found throughout the dermis in foetal skin, whereas in adult skin it was found to be associated with the BMZ and around the blood vessels, hair follicles and eccrine glands. Intracellular FA-2 antigen was demonstrated in proliferating fibroblasts by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique and immunoelectron microscopy of the fibroblasts revealed staining of the antigen in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmatic reticulum at the trans-side of the Golgi complex as well as in vesicles close to the plasma membranes. FA-2, a hitherto undescribed antigen associated with human BMZ, is probably being synthesized by proliferating fibroblasts.\r"

Data from 12 controlled trials, involving over 3000 participants, show that corticosteroids reduce the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome overall and in all the subgroups of trial participants that we examined. This reduction in respiratory morbidity was associated with reductions in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal death. There is no strong evidence suggesting adverse effects of corticosteroids. The risks of fetal and neonatal infection may be raised if they are administered after prolonged rupture of the membranes, but this possibility is not substantiated by the results of the available trials. The available data on long-term follow-up suggest that the short-term beneficial effects of corticosteroids may be reflected in reduced neurological morbidity in the longer term.\r"

A total of 129 structural cardiac abnormalities was diagnosed; 53% of these patients were referred because of an abnormal 'four-chamber view' on ultrasound at the referring hospital; 47 of the pregnancies (69% of the 68 patients referred before 28 weeks) were terminated, and in the remaining 82 pregnancies outcome was poor with only 20 infants (16%) surviving longer than 11 months. The prenatal diagnosis was fully or partly correct in 96% of the 111 cases where it was possible to verify the diagnosis by post-mortem or postnatal diagnosis. In the 82 pregnancies not terminated, 13 of the 22 cases given a moderate or good prognosis survived more than 11 months (59% survival), but only seven of the 60 (12% survival) given a fatal, poor or uncertain prognosis.

In 16% in which the dilator muscle could be detected, it was atrophic, and in 11% the pigmented epithelium was thinned and atrophic. Cellular inflammatory infiltrations were seen in 88% of all specimens. They were mostly slight in eyes which before operation had been without posterior synechiae of the iris. In most of the eyes in which posterior synechiae had been present moderate or heavy inflammatory cell infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often associated with macrophages, neutrophils, or eosinophils, were found. In five iris specimens acid fast bacilli were present. This raises the question whether these can survive systemically despite dapsone chemotherapy in the iris, thus leading to dapsone-resistant leprosy and to recurrent iritis.\r"

The 73 patients (10.3%) with occult testicular leukemia (TL) had a significantly increased risk of subsequent relapse (P = .0001) and death (P less than .0001) when compared with patients with negative biopsies. Protocol-specified therapy for occult TL included reinduction therapy with concurrent bilateral testicular radiation, and 2 years of maintenance therapy. Four-year event-free survival for patients with negative biopsies was 78.2% +/- 4% versus 65% +/- 14% for patients with occult TL who received protocol-specified therapy (P = .05). This study suggests that (1) occult TL occurs in 10% of males completing 2 years of maintenance therapy; (2) occult TL significantly increases risk for subsequent relapse and death; (3) treatment results for occult TL and isolated overt off therapy TL (no previous biopsy) are similar; and (4) given current therapy, documentation of occult TL after 2 years of therapy does not improve disease-free survival.\r"

  ".W": "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a disorder of myelopoiesis characterized by severe neutropenia secondary to a maturational arrest at the level of promyelocytes. We treated five patients with SCN with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) for 42 days and subsequently, between 1 and 3 months later, with rhG-CSF for 142 days. The objective was to evaluate the safety and ability of these factors to elicit a neutrophil response. rhGM-CSF was administered at a dose of 3 to 30 micrograms/kg/d (30 to 60 minutes, intravenously). In all patients, a specific, dose-dependent increase in the absolute granulocyte counts was observed. However, in four patients this increase was due to an increase in eosinophils, and in only one patient it was due to an increase in the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). Subsequently, all patients received rhG-CSF at a dose of 3 to 15 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously. In contrast to rhGM-CSF treatment, all five patients responded to rhG-CSF during the first 6 weeks of treatment with an increase in the ANC to above 1,000/microL. The level of ANC could be maintained during maintenance treatment. In one patient, the increase in ANC was associated with an improvement of a severe pneumonitis caused by Peptostreptococcus and resistant to antibiotic treatment. No severe bacterial infections occurred in any of the patients during CSF treatment. All patients tolerated rhGM-CSF and rhG-CSF treatment without severe side effects. These results demonstrate the beneficial effect of rhG-CSF in SCN patients.\r"

  ".W": "The elongated mutant of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2 PI) designated as alpha 2 PI-Nara is caused by a frameshift mutation found near the 3' end of the coding region of the alpha 2 PI gene. To elucidate the mechanism by which this molecular abnormality leads to alpha 2 PI deficiency in plasma, we transfected an expression plasmid for alpha 2 PI-Nara into a monkey kidney cell line COS-7 or human hepatoma cell line HepG2 synthesizing alpha 2 PI, and analyzed the secretory process of the expressed alpha 2 PI-Nara by radioimmunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The results obtained showed that the recombinant alpha 2 PI-Nara was retained within the cells for prolonged periods as an endoglycosidase H-sensitive precursor form, and only a small portion of the recombinant protein was secreted into the medium as a neuraminidase-sensitive mature form. These results suggest that instead of being secreted from the cells, most of the alpha 2 PI-Nara undergoes degradation within the cells while its transport is retarded in the intracellular secretory pathway; thus, alpha 2 PI-Nara should lead to the alpha 2 PI deficiency primarily by causing a block in the intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex.\r"

  ".U": "90167278\r", 
  ".W": "The cDNA for interleukin-7 (IL-7) was recently isolated from a stromal cell line derived from a long-term B-lymphoid culture. We report that purified recombinant murine IL-7 can promote the clonal growth in semi-solid culture of a subpopulation of cells expressing the B220 surface antigen from normal murine bone marrow. These colony-forming cells (CFC-Pre-B) give rise to colonies of 20 to 1,000 cells after 7 days in culture. Morphologic examination of cells within the colonies showed a characteristic lymphoid morphology, and histochemical examination demonstrated an absence of markers associated with granulocyte, macrophage, eosinophil, or megakaryocyte differentiation, as well as an absence of hemoglobinization (indicative or erythroid differentiation). IL-7 was found to specifically enhance the infection of CFC-Pre-B but not CFU-GM when the cytokine was present during a 48-hour co-cultivation period between irradiated, retrovirus-producing psi 2 clones and normal mouse bone marrow cells. In contrast, IL-3 enhanced the infection of CFU-GM but not CFC-Pre-B. Thymidine suiciding studies suggest that this targeted infection is due to specific induction of cycling of CFC-Pre-B by IL-7 and CFU-GM by IL-3. These data demonstrate that IL-7 can target retroviral infection into a specific subpopulation of early B-lymphoid cells (CFC-Pre-B), and that IL-7 cannot directly promote the in vitro clonal growth of myeloid committed progenitor cells (ie, CFU-GM).\r"

  ".U": "90167280\r", 
  ".W": "In the majority of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, the c-abl gene is fused to the bcr gene, resulting in the transcription of an 8.5 kb chimeric bcr-abl mRNA, which is translated into a p210bcr-abl fusion protein. In about 50% of the Ph-positive acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL), the bcr-abl gene fusion is identical to CML, while in 50% an alternative fusion between these two genes occurs, in which the central bcr-sequences are absent. This results in transcription of a 7 kb bcr-abl mRNA, encoding a P190bcr-abl fusion protein. Cloning and sequencing of the chimeric part of bcr-abl cDNAs from two Ph-positive CML patients in chronic phase showed that in one patient, as in the Ph-positive ALL, all central bcr sequences are absent, while in the other patient, part of the bcr central sequences are deleted. Therefore, we speculate that the presence of the 7 kb chimeric ALL type mRNA in one of the patients is not sufficient to drive an acute rather than a chronic leukemic process in this case. The deletions of the central bcr-sequences described here define the minimal sequence requirement of the bcr-abl fusion gene in CML patients so far.\r"

  ".U": "90167282\r", 
  ".W": "Ras genes can be altered by point mutations at critical portions of their coding regions to acquire transforming ability in vitro. These point mutations have been detected in a variety of human malignancies. However, their relevance for the clinical and biologic behavior of the subgroups of patients exhibiting these mutations in unclear. We analyzed 100 patients with childhood acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs) for point mutations of exons 1 and 2 of all three ras genes (H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras) by polymerase chain reaction and a combination of oligonucleotide hybridization and direct DNA sequencing. A 6% incidence of N-ras gene mutations was detected, all of which occurred at different nucleotides of codons 12 or 13 of N-ras. When correlating presence of ras mutations with the clinical and biologic features and the clinical outcome of these cases, a significantly higher risk for hematologic relapse (P = .01) and a trend toward a lower rate of complete remission (P = .07) was noted. The two groups did not differ in any of the known high-risk factors of ALL. These results suggest that presence of an N-ras mutation in children with ALL may be an independent predictor for worse clinical outcome and therefore may have therapeutic implications; further studies to confirm these findings are required because of the small number of patients with N-ras mutations.\r"

Side effects were reported more commonly in the sulphasalazine group (27 versus 17, NS), but only 21 patients stopped treatment because of side effects (12 versus 9, NS). Analysis of the subgroup with an initial ESR greater than 20 mm/h failed to show any persisting differences of response between sulphasalazine and placebo.

Greater improvement occurred in those patients on active treatment than on placebo, with more benefit being detected in those patients with the symmetrical polyarticular but seronegative pattern of arthritis associated with a high acute-phase response. SASP was stopped in 26% because of side-effects but these were mild. No exacerbation or remission of psoriasis was observed.

The study was in a provincial English teaching hospital providing a vascular service for the area. Fifty patients were entered; 25 into the \"laser\" group and 25 into the \"control\" group. End points were (a) the success in passage through the occlusion and (b) the outcome 1 month after passage. Comparison of the groups showed no appreciable difference between the two methods with regard to age, sex, symptoms, incidence of diabetes, or previous myocardial infarctions. Successful passage through the occlusion followed by dilatation was achieved in 18 (72%) patients in the laser group and 20 (80%) in the control group. After 1 month, 13 (52%) arteries in the laser group were patent compared to 13 (57%) in the control group. Confidence limits for the difference in success of passage are -15% to +31%, and -24% to +33% for patency after 1 month. Since these limits include zero, it is unlikely that a longer trial would alter the difference between the two methods. The results suggest that the laser system currently in use is no better than conventional methods.\r"

In addition, 20 samples from multiple polyposis including adenomas with and without dysplasia, carcinomas in situ, and invasive carcinomas were studied. Using immunostaining techniques, normal mucosa was weakly stained, whereas the mucosa in the vicinity of tumors or inflammation showed enhanced staining. More tumors stained intensely with MoAb RAP-5 than with MoAb RAS-10. With MoAb RAP-5, most benign and malignant tumors showed enhanced staining. No significant differences in staining were noted in relation to superficial versus deeply invasive carcinomas or clinical staging. Immunostaining was also noted in some metastases. No significant differences in enhanced staining were found in carcinomas. Interestingly, the most extensive and enhanced immunostaining was noted in the villoglandular adenomas, dysplastic adenomas, and carcinomas in situ. The authors conclude that (1) ras protein expression is detectable in most benign, borderline, and malignant epithelial tumors of the colon as determined with MoAb RAP-5 and RAS-10, whereas enhanced expression is more often detected with RAP-5; (2) enhanced ras product expression in colon carcinomas does not seem to correlate with advanced tumor stages or with exocrine, NE, or phenotypically mixed tumors; and (3) the finding of the most intensely enhanced ras products expression in villoglandular polyps and carcinomas in situ suggests a possibly significant role for the oncogene in the early phases of transformation.\r"

Plasma samples from 118 healthy blood donors served as controls. Plasma prekallikrein (PKK) values, evaluated by chromogenic peptide substrate technique, were significantly decreased in patients with cancer compared with healthy blood donors. High molecular weight kininogen (HMwK) and Hageman factor (FXII) values, assayed by immunochemical techniques, were also decreased in the patients with cancer. The changes of contact factors were most pronounced in patients with liver metastasis. The most striking observation in our study, however, was the elevated inhibitor values in patients with cancer. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-M) and C1 inhibitor (C1INH) values, determined both by functional and immunochemical techniques, were markedly increased in patients with cancer. In conclusion, this study shows that patients with intestinal cancer have reduced values of contact factors and markedly elevated inhibitor values which indicate that development of malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal tract is associated with changes in the contact system of plasma.\r"

Using a combined assay for the three markers, the positive rate for BFP, IAP, and TPA was 92%, and approximately 100% in Stages II, III, and IV of the disease. Therefore, the combined marker assay improved the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. In curative resection patients, the percent of patients whose serum BFP levels returned to normal 1 week after the operation was 85. This was higher than the IAP or TPA levels (18% and 67%, respectively). Moreover, in inoperable patients, serum BFP levels showed a better correlation with the clinical course than serum IAP or TPA levels. Serum BFP is useful for monitoring patients with renal cell carcinoma who have an elevated BFP value.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) BL2-10D1 directed against a tumor-associated antigen of human bladder cancer was used to identify tumor cells obtained by bladder washing or voided urine. The reactivity of BL2-10D1 MoAb was detected by an immunoperoxidase method and evaluated in ten healthy donors and in a series of 65 patients. The 65 patients studied were divided into three groups: ten with nontumor bladder disease (group A); 36 with bladder carcinoma (group B); and 19 with a history of bladder neoplasia but no visible tumor at the time of cytologic sampling (group C). The results were compared with the standard cytologic diagnosis on Papanicolaou-stained preparations. Conventional cytologic study showed a high false-negative rate in low-grade tumors (transitional cell carcinomas [TCC] Grades 1 and 2, 1/4 and 4/17, respectively). All urine from patients with a histologically proved TCC Grade 1 were stained with BL2-10D1 MoAb. Cytologic findings from patients with TCC Grade 2 (17 cases) contained positive cells in 14 cases and failed to react in three cases. Furthermore, whereas urine from patients with TCC Grade 2 or 3 was not always stained with BL2-10D1 MoAb, all patients with dysplastic lesions (three cases) or carcinoma in situ (5 cases) showed a positive reactivity. Such results suggest that BL2-10D1 MoAb may be considered as a valuable adjunct to the classical methods of early detection and follow-up of bladder cancer. However, a larger scale study is needed for MoAb BL2-10D1 to be proposed as an aid to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of urine cytologic investigation in the follow-up of patients treated for recurring bladder cancer, and for the screening of workers exposed to potent bladder carcinogens.\r"

Patients were randomized in the Southwest Oncology Group (later the Pediatric Oncology Group [POG] to involved-field (IF) radiotherapy alone or IF radiotherapy followed by six courses of mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, and procarbazine (MOPP) chemotherapy; patients in the Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) were randomized to receive extended-field (EF) radiotherapy or IF radiotherapy followed by six courses of MOPP. An estimated 97% of patients receiving IF + MOPP were relapse-free and surviving (RFS) at 5 years, which was significantly better than 41% for patients receiving IF alone; however there was essentially no overall difference in survival experience between groups. Patients in CCSG and CALGB receiving IF + MOPP had significantly superior RFS at 5 years than patients receiving EF. Survival rate was not different between these two groups, an estimated 93% of patients surviving 5 years or longer. Although patients were not randomized between IF or EF radiotherapy, they were similar with respect to patient characteristics. There was some statistical evidence that RFS was superior at 5 years for patients receiving EF than for IF; however, there was no evidence of a difference in survival experience. The percentages of patients with late effects of therapy were not significantly different by treatment. The most common types of late effects were endocrine dysfunction and impaired resistance to infection. Overall, the response rate to therapy for relapse patients was good, being 83% among all patients who relapsed. Patient characteristics related to poor prognosis were the presence of constitutional (B) symptoms (fever, night sweats, and weight loss) and poor performance status.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine functions to restrain the renin release response to pharmacological and pathophysiological stimuli. To achieve this objective, we examined the effects of an adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine (DPSPX), on the renin release response induced by acute administration of hydralazine or by chronic clipping of the left renal artery (renovascular hypertensive rats). In conscious, unrestrained rats, DPSPX significantly increased plasma renin activity (PRA) in control rats, in rats treated with hydralazine, and in renovascular hypertensive rats. The effect of DPSPX on PRA was significantly greater in rats treated with hydralazine or in renovascular hypertensive rats compared with control rats. DPSPX did not influence arterial blood pressure in any group, did not affect the measurement of PRA, and did not alter the elimination of renin activity from the circulation. Additional experiments were performed in the in situ autoperfused kidney so that the effects of DPSPX on renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function could be assessed. In this experimental model, DPSPX also increased PRA in hydralazine-treated rats and in renovascular hypertensive rats without affecting arterial pressure, renal blood flow, or sodium excretion. In a final set of studies in conscious, unrestrained rats, adenosine deaminase increased PRA in a dose-dependent manner in hydralazine-treated rats and significantly increased the slope of the relation between PRA and the depressor response to hydralazine. We conclude: 1) Although the kidney has both A1 and A2 adenosine receptors mediating inhibitory and stimulatory actions, respectively, on renin release, the dominant effect of endogenous adenosine on renin release is inhibitory. 2) Even under basal physiological conditions, endogenous adenosine tonically inhibits renin release. 3) This inhibitory effect is augmented whenever the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated regardless of the approach used to activate renin release. 4) Endogenous adenosine negatively modulates renin release by a direct effect on juxtaglomerular cells.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacological evidence indicates that angiotensin (Ang II) converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate cardiovascular responses to sympathetic stimulation. To investigate the physiological significance of this attenuation, the pressor and heart rate responses to bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) were studied before and after administration of captopril and again during Ang II replacement in conscious, aortic nerve-sectioned rabbits with chronically implanted carotid occluders. In the control period, BCO produced increases (p less than 0.05) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of 37.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and 21.7 +/- 5.4 beats/min from baseline values of 79.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and 255.4 +/- 16.7 beats/min. Captopril (5 mg/kg i.v.) markedly reduced (p less than 0.05) both the pressor (10.2 +/- 2.6 mm Hg) and HR (5.0 +/- 4.0 beats/min) responses to BCO, in parallel with a decrease in plasma Ang II of 75%. Infusion of a subpressor dose of Ang II (5-25 ng/kg/min i.v.) increased plasma Ang II to precaptopril levels and fully restored (p less than 0.05) the pressor (33.0 +/- 5.7 mm Hg) and HR (19.8 +/- 7.7 beats/min) responses to BCO. In two additional series of experiments, the mechanism of the effects of captopril and Ang II were investigated. In the first series, cardiac baroreflex curves (pulse interval versus MAP) were generated by increasing or decreasing blood pressure with phenylephrine or nitroprusside (5-20 micrograms/kg/min i.v.). The slope of the linear region of the curve (2.9 msec/mm Hg) was not changed significantly by captopril treatment (3.1 msec/mm Hg) or Ang II replacement (3.2 msec/mm Hg), indicating that cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was not altered by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In the second series, the effect of captopril on the pressor response to exogenous norepinephrine (0.1-2.5 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) was tested. The response was reduced by less than 40%, indicating only a modest postsynaptic component to the action of captopril. These results provide physiological evidence for an important action of endogenous Ang II in facilitating the cardiovascular responses to sympathetic stimulation in conscious rabbits. This facilitation is not due to an action upon the baroreflex per se but results, at least in part, from a presynaptic action of Ang II.\r"

We investigated the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on both early and late phases of coxsackievirus murine myocarditis. Mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 and were divided into two main protocols. Mice in the early treatment protocol (n = 30) were treated on day 1 after infection with either captopril or saline through day 6 of infection and euthanized on day 6 of infection. In the late treatment protocol, mice (n = 60) were treated starting on day 10 of infection through day 30 of infection with either captopril or saline. Mice were killed on days 20 and 30 of infection. In the early treatment protocol, heart weight was 67 +/- 14 mg in the captopril-treated group versus 98 +/- 17 mg in the control group (p less than 0.0001). The degree of inflammation, necrosis, and dystrophic calcification assessed with a semiquantitative histological score was significantly less in the captopril-treated group. The degree of pathological involvement determined by planimetry of histological sections was 8.1 +/- 7.2% for the captopril-treated group versus 22.5 +/- 10.0% for the saline-treated group (p less than 0.0001). In the late treatment protocol, captopril also caused a reduction in heart weight as compared with controls at day 20 (116 +/- 21 mg in captopril-treated group vs. 166 +/- 34 mg in controls, p less than 0.0001) and also at day 30 (136 +/- 23 mg in captopril-treated group vs. 185 +/- 48 mg in controls, p less than 0.004). On days 20 and 30 of infection, the degree of inflammation, necrosis, and dystrophic calcification was similar in both groups. We conclude that captopril is beneficial in acute coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis because it reduces heart weight and necrosis when administered early and reduces heart weight when administered in a delayed manner.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in the absence and presence of regional ischemia was examined in eight conscious dogs chronically instrumented with ultrasonic devices for measuring LV wall thickness and volume. During treadmill exercise, ischemia was induced (hydraulic occluder) to produce less than 10% systolic wall thickening in the ischemic zone. LV filling was assessed by the peak filling rate (PFR), mean filling rates in the first and second halves of filling (mFR1 and mFR2), an early filling index from mitral valve opening to minimal diastolic pressure (PDm), and the percentage of atrial filling. Also, LV relaxation (tau) and wall thinning rates during isovolumetric relaxation and the first and second halves of the filling phase were assessed. During control exercise without ischemia, PDm decreased by 2.61 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) to -1.1 mm Hg and there was a downward shift of the entire LV diastolic pressure-volume (P-V) curve. The LV relaxation rate, PFR, mFR1, and mFR2 were enhanced. Early filling was increased by 116%, the percentage of atrial filling by 118%, and overall diastolic filling by 23% despite a 63% decrease in the filling period. During ischemic exercise, systolic function was depressed compared with the resting state, PDm increased by 4.84 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) associated with a pronounced rightward and upward shift of the early portion of the P-V curve. LV relaxation rate, PFR, and mFR1 were reduced, the early filling index fell sharply by 62% but percentage of atrial filling was unchanged, while overall diastolic filling decreased by 30%. The thinning rate of the control wall was enhanced, whereas that of ischemic wall was depressed. Multiple factors contributed to the markedly impaired early and overall diastolic LV filling during ischemia, including impaired systolic function, reduced relaxation rate, nonuniformity of wall motion, an upward shift of the early diastolic P-V curve, and absence of a compensatory increase in late diastolic filling.\r"

  ".U": "90167993\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous electrocardiographic criteria, which are largely dependent on fixed voltage thresholds, have been proposed for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Electrocardiographic criteria for LVH were examined in 4,684 subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who underwent echocardiographic study for LVH. Echocardiographic LVH was detected in 290 men (14.2%) and 465 women (17.6%). Electrocardiographic features of LVH were present in 2.9% of men (60/2,042) and 1.5% of women (39/2,642). The overall sensitivity of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of LVH was 6.9%, whereas specificity was 98.8%. Sensitivity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for LVH was marginally lower in women than in men (5.6% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.075). Obesity was inversely associated with sensitivity (p less than 0.05, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). Smoking was also inversely related to sensitivity (p = 0.001, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). In contrast, sensitivity of the ECG increased with age (p less than 0.001, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). These findings suggest that electrocardiographic detection of LVH can be improved by incorporating information about noncardiac factors that impact on electrocardiographic sensitivity for LVH, presumably by attenuating QRS voltage. New strategies that take into consideration sex, age, smoking status, and obesity might improve the sensitivity of the ECG without diminishing specificity.\r"
