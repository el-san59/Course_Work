  ".W": "The coronary Doppler catheter has been used primarily in the measurement of coronary vasodilator reserve, most often as the ratio of peak to resting velocity in response to an intracoronary dose of papaverine. We have developed a new method based on the continuity equation using a Doppler catheter for the assessment of stenosis severity in the coronary circulation by means of quantitative velocity measurements obtained by complex spectral analysis of the Doppler signal. With this system we have been able to detect a high-velocity stenosis jet in a canine model of coronary stenosis of known cross-sectional area. Using the peak velocity obtained by complex spectral analysis, we found a strong correlation between cross-sectional areas determined by the continuity equation and known cross-sectional areas (r = 0.93, SEE = 0.23 mm2). We also found a strong correlation between the ratio of peak stenosis velocity to proximal vessel velocity and percent diameter and percent area stenosis (r = 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). When the velocity was determined with conventional zero-crossing methods for these parameters, there was no correlation between calculated and known values for cross-sectional area and percent diameter or area stenosis. Measurements of the vasodilator reserve in response to intracoronary papaverine before and after implantation of the stenosis did not correlate with any of the anatomic parameters of stenosis severity regardless of the method of signal analysis (zero-crossing or complex spectral analysis). The measurement of quantitative peak coronary velocity with a Doppler catheter using complex spectral analysis may provide an accurate method for determining the severity of a coronary stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Differences in coronary flow reserve with anatomically similar coronary artery stenoses have been attributed to 1) nonstandard physiologic conditions, 2) inadequacies of measurements of coronary artery stenosis dimension and/or coronary blood flow, and 3) inadequate hyperemic stimulus. Our study tested the hypothesis that details of coronary artery stenosis geometry, which may or may not be apparent on coronary angiograms, also may contribute importantly to such differences. A simple and complex coronary artery stenosis, each of which reduced vessel cross-sectional area by 84%, was introduced in random order into the left anterior descending coronary artery of nine closed-chest, sedated swine. The simple stenosis had a single lumen while the complex stenosis had five small lumena whose combined area equaled that of the single lumen stenosis. Measurements of hemodynamics and regional myocardial blood flow (microspheres) were made at control and after 10 minutes of adenosine infused at 400 micrograms/min and then at 800 micrograms/min distal to each stenosis. Both heart rate and aortic mean pressure were controlled and thus did not change versus initial baseline (129 +/- 4 minutes and 120 +/- 10 mm Hg, mean +/- SD, respectively) during the study. Baseline total flow (ml/sec) distal to the stenosis was similar at each control (1.05 +/- 0.35 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.34, simple versus complex, respectively; p = NS). At maximal adenosine, total flow with the simple stenosis was 3.44 +/- 0.92 versus 2.77 +/- 0.51 for complex (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of a complete endothelial lining was confirmed histologically. In rings from normal arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha in the presence of indomethacin and ketanserin (a 5-HT2-serotonergic blocker), ergonovine caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. They were attenuated by rauwolscine (an alpha 2-adrenergic blocker), inhibited by methiothepin (a combined 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-serotonergic blocker) or by pertussis toxin (an inhibitor of several G proteins) and abolished by oxyhemoglobin (a selective inactivator of endothelium-derived relaxing factor). In quiescent rings from normal arteries, ergonovine caused contractions that were inhibited by the presence of the endothelium; this endothelium-dependent inhibition was abolished by oxyhemoglobin. The direct contractions were not affected by prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), rauwolscine, 6-hydroxydopamine (an agent causing chemical sympathetectomy), or diphenhydramine (an H1-histaminergic blocker) but were inhibited by ketanserin. In rings with regenerated endothelium contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to ergonovine were reduced significantly and were not inhibited by pertussis toxin. In quiescent rings with regenerated endothelium, the endothelium-dependent inhibition of ergonovine-induced contraction was less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline values of heart rate, LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic stress, and LV systolic wall stress were greater in the LV failure dogs (p less than 0.01), whereas the ejection phase index, rate of change of LV short-axis diameter, LV dD/dt, was depressed compared with control animals. In the control animals, isoproterenol infusion increased Vcf and LV dD/dt significantly (p less than 0.05), whereas LV systolic wall stress did not change. In the LV failure dogs, the increases in Vcf and LV dD/dt were less (p less than 0.01), and LV systolic wall stress increased (p less than 0.01). In the control animals, LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic stress, LV end-diastolic stress-dimension ratio, diastolic radial myocardial stiffness, and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation decreased (p less than 0.05), whereas in the LV failure dogs, LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic stress, diastolic radial myocardial stiffness, and the LV end-diastolic stress-dimension ratio increased. In the LV failure group, the endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio fell to 0.59 +/- 0.06 during isoproterenol infusion, that is, significantly lower than in control dogs (0.93 +/- 0.06). These data support the concept that potent sympathomimetic amines exert deleterious effects on systolic and diastolic function in the failing heart, potentially related to subendocardial hypoperfusion.\r"

Initially, canine myoglobin was administered to 11 dogs by both bolus injection and 40-minute infusion, and the subsequent disappearance patterns of myoglobin from plasma monitored by radioimmunoassay. A monoexponential regression line (corresponding to a one-compartment model) and a biexponential regression line (corresponding to a two-compartment model) were determined for each set of washout data, the kinetic parameters were calculated, and the goodness of fit of each model was assessed. Results were similar after both methods of myoglobin administration. In five of 11 animals, the one-compartment model described the myoglobin kinetics better; in the other six animals, the two-compartment model was statistically superior, but values for the volume of distribution and elimination rate constant differed by only 10% from the one-compartment estimates. After bolus administration of myoglobin and with a one-compartment model, the volume of distribution of myoglobin was determined to be 1,601 +/- 77 (SEM) ml, representing 6.8 +/- 0.2% of total body weight; the elimination rate constant averaged 0.132 +/- 0.006/min and corresponded to a mean half-time of disappearance of 5.5 +/- 0.2 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied these effects first in the exposed heart and subsequently in the isolated heart. The coronary arteries were cannulated and perfused with fresh whole blood. The left ventricle was filled with an electrolyte solution and was allowed to pump against an artificial load. Studies were completed in 37 of 45 animals (19 controls, 12 with mitral prostheses and six with mitral rings). In the open-thorax situation, surgically treated hearts differed little from controls, apart from a higher pressure drop over the mitral ostium. Compared with controls, isolated hearts with a prosthesis showed a 28% lower peak isovolumic pressure and a 25% lower unloaded maximal stroke volume; hearts with a mitral ring showed 14% and 25% lower values, respectively. Prosthetic valve or ring implantation causes obstruction of the mitral ostium, impedes pressure development, and restricts movement of the basal ventricular wall. Resection of the native valve doubles the loss of contractile function.\r"

  ".U": "89355373\r", 
  ".W": "Favorable changes in lipoproteins, inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction of serum thromboxane (TX), altered plasma-membrane fluidity, and reduced production of growth factors (mitogens) have all been implicated as possibly being involved in the inhibition of arteriosclerosis by fish oil (FO), which is rich in omega 3 fatty acids; however, causal relations are mostly lacking. Several putative mechanisms responsible for the salutary effects of FO were investigated in a canine model of accelerated vein-graft arteriosclerosis. Venoarterial autografts (N = 192) were implanted in 48 hypercholesterolemic dogs divided into six groups: group A, control; B, FO (as MaxEPA, 200 mg/kg/day eicosapentaenoic acid); C, aspirin (ASA, 50 mg/kg/day); D, TX synthetase inhibitor (TXSI [CGS-12970], 10 mg/kg/day); E, FO + ASA; and F, FO + TXSI. At sacrifice 3 months later, there was no significant difference in plasma lipoproteins, hepatic low density lipoprotein-receptor concentration, red blood cell fragility, bleeding time, or platelet count compared with controls; the decrease in platelet aggregation (30 +/- 5% [mean +/- SEM]) was similar in all treatment groups. Arterialized vein-graft intimal thickening was significantly inhibited by FO (with or without ASA), while ASA alone was ineffective. Conversely, serum TX was significantly lower only in the ASA and FO + ASA groups. Serum mitogenic activity was higher at 3 months in the control group versus all treatment groups. Compared with baseline values, serum mitogenic activity rose significantly over time in the control and the TXSI groups, and an increase or rising trend was present in all other treatment groups except for the FO-treated animals. Thus, the salutary biologic effect of FO in this hypercholesterolemic model of arterialized vein grafts may have been more related to in vivo inhibition of platelet-mitogen growth factor release than to changes in lipoproteins, low density lipoprotein receptors, platelet function, or eicosanoid metabolism. These observations underscore the need for further studies to clarify the interactions between FO (omega 3 fatty acids) and paracrine cellular mitogenic factors in the context of atherosclerosis prevention.\r"

To establish the most appropriate dilator agent, we tested the reactivity of ring segments of human IMA in organ baths to various constrictor and dilator agents. We found that the thromboxane mimetic U46619 was the most potent IMA constrictor agent, followed by norepinephrine, serotonin, phenylephrine, and potassium chloride (K+). In K+- or U46619-precontracted IMA, glyceryl trinitrate and papaverine caused full relaxation. In K+-precontracted arteries, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem caused full relaxation, but nifedipine was 15-fold more potent than the other calcium antagonists. In contrast, pretreatment of vessels with glyceryl trinitrate failed to alter subsequent contraction to U46619 or K+ while nifedipine pretreatment abolished subsequent contraction to K+ and reduced sensitivity of the IMA to U46619. We conclude that perioperative IMA spasm could be treated with the rapid-onset, nonspecific, vasodilator glyceryl trinitrate, but for prophylaxis of IMA spasm, calcium antagonists or specific receptor antagonists should be tested in the clinical setting.\r"

The median age at death was 3 days. For the histological and histometrical studies, 5-mm blocks from six comparable sites of the left (L) and right (R) CAs were serially sectioned and routinely processed. The arterial size and wall thickness were measured. Macroscopically, the CAs in group 1 were normal except for the prevalence of left dominance (56%). In contrast in group 2, the CAs were thicker and tortuous. Histopathology was restricted almost exclusively to group 2 specimens (11 of 19), with the proximal LCAs being the most affected. However, eight hearts with EFE in group 2 had no structural wall changes of the CAs. Histometrically, the sizes (external diameters) of the LCAs and RCAs were similar (0.5-1.0 mm) in groups 1 and 2 and in the normal group; however, we noted an increase in percent medial thickness in group 2 specimens, especially of the LCAs. Furthermore, in some group 2 hearts, the wall thickness (intima and media) relative to the luminal size (internal radius) of proximal and middle LCAs was significantly increased, suggesting the presence of ventricle-CA communications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of factors that may have influenced the course of endomyocardial fibrosis showed that biventricular involvement (moderate or severe), right ventricular fibrosis, and presence of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation were associated with greater mortality.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the fate of cryopreserved pulmonary conduit allografts, an experimental model was used in lambs. The lambs underwent resection of the pulmonary trunk and valve to the level of the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries and then were replaced by cryopreserved (CryoLife, Incorporated, Laboratories) pulmonary conduit allografts obtained from lambs of similar size. Lambs were operated on at 4 weeks of age and followed up with cardiac catheterization and cineangiography every 3 months for a period of 18 months. Lambs were electively sacrificed in the following order: two at 1 month, two at 3 months, one at 6 months, two at 12 months, and five at 18 months. To assess the structure of the conduit tissue, sections for light microscopy were obtained from the proximal, midportion, and distal ends of the conduit. While the lambs grew from a weight of 11.7 kg at the time of implant to more than 70 kg at 18 months, the diameter of the pulmonary conduit distended from 16 mm at the time of implant to 17.7, 19.1, 24.9, 34.3, and 33.7 mm at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. The length of the conduit also extended from an original inner length of 25 mm and an original outer length of 32 mm to the following dimensions: inner lengths of 27.9, 32.7, 38.8, 43.6, and 45.3 mm, respectively, at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven consecutive patients aged 1-38 years underwent operation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) between 1972 and 1986. Isolated myectomy-myotomy was performed in 43 patients, three patients underwent myectomy and concomitant aortic valve repair, and one patient underwent concomitant mitral valve replacement. The peak systolic pressure gradient from the left ventricle to the aorta decreased from 70 +/- 33 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) preoperatively to 10 +/- 15 mm Hg immediately after repair (p less than 0.001). Moderate or severe mitral insufficiency was identified in 16 patients preoperatively and was corrected by myectomy alone in 15. There was no operative mortality; two late deaths occurred during follow-up (median, 5 years; maximum, 16 years) for estimated 5- and 10-year survivals of 97 +/- 2% and 88 +/- 10%, respectively. Reoperation was required for aortic valve replacement (n = 2), remyectomy (n = 2), and permanent pacemaker implantation (n = 3). Preoperative symptoms were relieved in 24 of 29 (83%) patients with dyspnea, in 18 of 19 (95%) with angina, and in six of 10 (60%) with syncope. These results support myectomy-myotomy for symptomatic children and young adults with HOCM. Also, it appears that late survival after myectomy-myotomy in these young patients may be improved over that observed in historical controls treated with medications alone; operation should be considered for asymptomatic children and adults less than 40 years of age with large (greater than 80 mm Hg) left ventricular outflow gradients.\r"

Because this technique aims at restoring not only tricuspid valve function but also right ventricular size and geometry, the following parameters were studied: 1) right ventricular size, by measuring the apex-annulus distance compared with that of a group of 30 normal volunteers; and 2) tricuspid valve motion and function. The apex-annulus distance ranged from 5.8 to 8 cm (mean, 6.4 cm) in the Ebstein group and 3.8 to 5.1 cm (mean, 4.3 cm) in the control group. There was no tricuspid stenosis. Right ventricular filling was normal as documented by color-flow mapping. Tricuspid regurgitation was trivial in three patients, mild in four, and severe in only one, in whom a significantly restricted motion of the leaflets was demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal management of dextrotransposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum is currently an arterial switch procedure performed in the first 2 weeks of life. However, a subgroup of patients presents for surgery beyond this time for reasons of sickness, size, or late referral. Experience with 11 such patients (mean age at first-stage procedure, 4.5 months) has revealed that the left ventricle can be prepared by a surprisingly short interval period (median, 9 days) between a first-stage preparatory operation (pulmonary artery band with or without a shunt) and a subsequent second-stage arterial switch procedure. Serial two-dimensional echocardiography showed that left ventricular mass increased by a mean of 85% during this short interval. Mean left ventricular-right ventricular-pressure ratio as measured by cardiac catheterization increased from 0.5 +/- 0.08 a median of 7 days before the first stage to 1.04 +/- 0.29 a median of 7 days after the first stage. One patient underwent a Senning procedure because of an intramural left coronary artery. The other 10 patients underwent an arterial switch, with no early deaths. Median hospitalization after the arterial switch was 8 days. There has been one late death at 5 months. No patient has been detected to have abnormal ventricular function, although trivial to mild aortic regurgitation has been commonly observed with color flow mapping. These results have encouraged us to offer a two-stage arterial switch procedure to appropriate infants with an interval period of approximately 1 week. Both stages can be performed at one hospitalization, with important psychosocial, logistic, and financial advantages.\r"

The effect of these alterations on cerebral blood flow (CBF) are unknown. This study was designed to determine the relation of temperature and mean arterial pressure to CBF during hypothermic CPB (18 degrees-32 degrees C), with and without periods of total circulatory arrest. CBF was measured before, during, and after hypothermic CPB with xenon-clearance techniques in 67 pediatric patients, aged 1 day-16 years. Patients were grouped based on different CPB techniques: group A, repair during moderate-hypothermic bypass at 25 degrees-32 degrees C; group B, repair during deep-hypothermic bypass at 18 degrees-22 degrees C; and group C, repair with total circulatory arrest at 18 degrees C. There was a significant correlation of CBF with temperature during CPB. CBF significantly decreased under hypothermic conditions in all groups compared with prebypass levels under normothermia. In groups A and B, CBF returned to baseline levels in the rewarming phase of CPB and exceeded baseline levels after bypass. In group C, no significant increase in CBF was observed during rewarming after total circulatory arrest (32 +/- 12 minutes) or after weaning from CPB. During moderate-hypothermic CPB (25 degrees-32 degrees C), there was no association between CBF and mean arterial pressure. However, during deep-hypothermic CPB (18 degrees-22 degrees C), there was an association between CBF and mean arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We retrospectively reviewed 29 patients undergoing modified Fontan repair at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to examine the relation between preoperative PAI (determined echocardiographically) and operative mortality. Twenty-four of these 29 patients underwent pulmonary artery augmentation at the time of Fontan repair. PAIs ranged from 48 to 541 mm2/m2. Operative mortality was 21%. PAI ranged from 68 to 233 mm2/m2 in nonsurvivors and from 48 to 541 mm2/m2 in survivors. There was no statistically significant difference in PAI between survivors and nonsurvivors; the lowest PAI associated with survival (48 mm2/m2) was one fourth of the lowest PAI value previously reported. There was a trend, not statistically significant, toward increased survival in those with larger PAIs. We conclude that patients should not be excluded from consideration for Fontan's repair solely on the basis of pulmonary artery size.\r"

This therapy resulted in mitral valve replacement in 13, aortic valve replacement in 135, aortic segment replacement in 151 (including total aortic replacement in 10), nearly total aortic replacement in 26, entire thoracic aortic replacement in seven, and replacement of the entire descending and abdominal aorta in 20 patients. The early (30-day) survival was 94%, and the 5- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 75% and 56%, respectively. Fusiform aneurysms were present in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, or both in 135, the descending aorta in two, the thoracoabdominal aorta in four, and the abdominal aorta in seven. Aortic dissection occurred in 102 (67%) patients, and 34 (22%) patients with ascending aortic operations required reoperation. This study suggests that the results of current techniques warrant a more aggressive approach to these problems to permit better long-term results.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of the intact mitral apparatus in left ventricular (LV) systolic performance has been indirectly suggested by clinical studies of chordal-preserving mitral valve replacement (MVR) or reconstruction. The importance of the intact mitral apparatus has been clearly demonstrated in isovolumic experimental preparations but has not been demonstrated unequivocally in ejecting hearts. Therefore, this question was assessed independently of load in an in situ, open-chest ejecting canine heart preparation (n = 9). Three orthogonal LV dimensions were measured by sonomicrometry. During MVR with complete chordal preservation, snares were placed around the anterior and posterior papillary muscles. After the hearts were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, LV function was assessed by caval occlusion to alter LV preload abruptly. The slopes of the end-systolic--pressure-volume (end-systolic elastance, Ees) and stroke-work--end-diastolic volume (preload-recruitable stroke work, PRSW) relations were used to measure global LV systolic function; similarly, the slopes of the end-systolic--pressure-dimension (regional end-systolic elastance, rEes) and stroke-work--end-diastolic dimension changes in regional LV systolic performance. All chordae were then divided by pulling the snares. Immediate reassessment revealed deterioration of global LV function: Ees declined by 72% (14.1 +/- 11.2 mm Hg/ml [mean +/- SD] vs. 3.9 +/- 3.5 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001), and PRSW declined by 39% (129 +/- 37 vs. 79 +/- 29 mm Hg, p = 0.0001). Regional LV function was also adversely affected but somewhat selectively: rEes decreased significantly in all three LV dimensions (p less than or equal to 0.03), but rPRSW decreased significantly (-21%) only in the anteroposterior minor LV axis (89 +/- 19 vs. 70 +/- 15 mm Hg, p = 0.005) and in the septal-lateral axis (-19%, p = NS). These data demonstrate the importance of the intact mitral apparatus on LV systolic performance in ejecting hearts, particularly in the LV regions subtended by the papillary muscles.\r"

The ages ranged from 25 to 79 years (mean, 56 years). Atherosclerotic aneurysms were present in 14 patients, dissecting aortic aneurysms in 16, and other lesion types in four. Replacement of the ascending aorta was performed in 10 patients, replacement of the ascending aorta and arch in 12, replacement of the distal arch in two, and other procedures in 10. Perfusion techniques consisted of femoral artery perfusion and SCP to the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery. The blood temperature was maintained at 16 degrees-20 degrees C. SCP time ranged from 25 to 214 minutes (mean, 123 minutes). Operative death occurred in three (9%) patients. Neurological sequelae occurred in one patient (cerebral infarction), but significant respiratory and hemorrhagic problems were not encountered. For the SCP protocols, we advise that perfusion pressures at bilateral superficial temporal arteries be kept at approximately 50 mm Hg and that venous oxygen saturation of the superior vena caval line or internal jugular vein be kept at above 90%. With appropriate monitoring, this method can be performed in aortic arch or related surgeries with low morbidity results.\r"

In a series of 272 consecutive, unselected patients with aortic dissection undergoing surgical treatment during a 25-year span (1963-1987), 128 (47 +/- 3% [+/- 70% confidence level (CL)]) had an acute type A dissection.

One patient died in the immediate postoperative period due to severe brain injury, yielding an operative mortality rate of 14 +/- 14%.

Aortic incompetence was present in 10 patients, a situation that required valvular replacement in five and valvular repair in five. In 10 patients, the dissection extended to the transverse aortic arch, requiring profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest. All patients survived the operation. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 44 months. All patients were monitored by Doppler echocardiographic studies. In addition, 10 underwent angiography; six, a computed tomographic scan; and five, magnetic resonance imaging. In all patients but two, the ascending aorta and transverse arch had a normal appearance. In three patients, a limited dissection persisted that did not require reoperation. Dissection of the descending aorta was present in 10 patients. One patient required a valvular replacement 18 months after surgery, and one underwent heart transplantation for an associated cardiomyopathy 14 months after surgery. These preliminary results indicate that surgical glue can be used safely and efficiently in type A aortic dissection as an alternative to aortic replacement.\r"

The predominant microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in those patients with native aortic valve endocarditis. The abscess was limited to the aortic annulus in 10 patients and was either multiple or had perforated the left ventricular outflow tract in 11 patients. Most patients were desperately ill at the time of operation. Repair was accomplished by aggressive debridement of all apparently infected tissue and reconstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract with autologous pericardium. Although postoperative complications were common, only one patient died in hospital. Operative survivors have been followed up from 3 to 68 months (mean, 29 months). One patient died of complications of repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm 34 months after surgery; his prosthetic aortic valve and patch were intact at autopsy.

We report here our 10-year experience with this prosthesis, based on studies of all 1,104 consecutive patients who were operated on from June 1977 to August 1987. There were 816 aortic (AVR), 187 mitral (MVR), and 101 combined mitral and aortic (double, DVR) valve replacements. Cumulative follow-up was 5,061 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Early mortality was 3.8% after AVR, 7.5% after MVR, and 10.0% after DVR. The probability of surviving 10 years after AVR was 72%; after MVR, 56%; and after DVR, 60%. Early and late survival reflected the patient's preoperative status and nonvalvular cardiac disease. Thromboembolism occurred at linearized rates of 1.3%, 1.3%, and 1.8%/yr after AVR, MVR, and DVR, respectively. There were five cases of valvular thrombosis, none fatal, resulting in a linearized rate of 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.2%/yr after AVR, MVR, and DVR, respectively. There were no instances of structural failure. Morbidity from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 0.7%/yr, with seven fatal events, all of cerebral origin. The long-term experience with the Medtronic Hall valve indicates that, in addition to its previously demonstrated excellent hemodynamic performance, there are low risks of thromboembolism and thrombosis and no instances of primary structural failure.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the outcome of aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in octogenarians, we retrospectively studied 64 patients, aged 80-89 years, who underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis from 1974 to 1987. Mean aortic valve gradient was 61 +/- 22 mm Hg, and valve area was 0.5 +/- 0.2 cm2. Concurrent coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 29 patients, mitral valve replacement in two, and both procedures in two. Serious, comorbid, noncardiac conditions were infrequent. In-hospital mortality was 9.4%. Outcomes were classified as 1a) uncomplicated; 1b) complicated (technically complicated surgery, temporary encephalopathy, discharge to a rehabilitation facility, or some combination thereof) but with ultimately good results; or 2) unfavorable (death or permanent, severe neurological deficit). There were 28 (44%) patients in group 1a, 24 (38%) in group 1b, and 12 (19%) in group 2. Of 18 patients with preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, two (11%) were in group 2. Of 31 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement only, two (6%) were in group 2, compared with 10 of 33 (30%) patients who had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral valve replacement, or both (p = 0.02). Late follow-up at 28 +/- 5 months revealed four cardiac and seven noncardiac deaths, with actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates of 83 +/- 5% and 67 +/- 10%, respectively. With few exceptions, survivors were free of cardiac symptoms. Thus, short- and long-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in otherwise healthy octogenarians is generally favorable, even in the presence of preoperative left ventricular systolic dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 1-month mortality was 4.7% for the septal MM group and 6.9% for the MVR group (p = NS). The mean time of postoperative follow-up was 118 months, ranging between 1 and 196 months. The annual mortality was 0.7% for the septal MM group and 1.3% for the MVR group (p = NS). In the MVR group, 98% of patients had been assigned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III and IV before surgery; only 24% were classified as such at 10-year follow-up (p less than 0.001). In the septal MM group, 90% were in NYHA functional classes III and IV before surgery whereas only 27% were in these two classes postoperatively (p less than 0.001). A comparison of preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic findings revealed a significant reduction in left ventricular outflow gradient at rest: from 69 +/- 41 mm Hg preoperatively to 10 +/- 22 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.001) in the septal MM group and from 75 +/- 45 mm Hg preoperatively to 10 +/- 21 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.001) in the MVR group. In addition, the MVR group had a significant postoperative reduction in mean left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, from 21 mm Hg preoperatively to 15 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Follow-up was conducted between 5 and 12 years postoperatively and was 98% complete. Survival was 65 +/- 4% at 10 years and was independently influenced by advancing age, poor ventricular function, male sex, concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery, and valvular type. The risk of structural valvular dysfunction, reoperation, and any valve-related mortality and morbidity was significantly increased with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial prosthesis. Long-term survival after valvular replacement was influenced by patient- and valve-related factors. The Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valve had an unusually high incidence of premature failure.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with chronic renal failure experience profound hypotension during hemodialysis. This has been attributed both to autonomic and ventricular dysfunction. In an attempt to distinguish which, if either, is important in this role, we assessed both autonomic and left ventricular function in 10 such patients. Cardioactive medication was stopped 24 hours prior to the investigations. Autonomic function was assessed from day/night blood pressure and heart rate variation and from the hemodynamic response to tilting and the Valsalva maneuver using an intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring technique. Left ventricular function was assessed scintigraphically both before and during hemodialysis. Day/night variation was significantly reduced in the patients with chronic renal failure (BP 13/7 +/- 8/6 mmHg, HR 5 +/- 4) compared with a control population (BP 36/28 +/- 10/5 mmHg, HR 19 +/- 6). Nine patients had a \"square wave\" response to the Valsalva maneuver. Both of these abnormalities are usually seen in patients with heart failure and are attributed to volume overload and a consequent failure of baroreceptor response. Blood pressure fell during hemodialysis (mean fall 40/22 +/- 20/10 mmHg) in all patients, but heart rate did not change (-2 +/- 16) despite the hypotension. All patients had a normal or high resting ejection fraction (mean 66%, range 55-79%), and there was no change during dialysis. This indicates that the hypotension was not due to left ventricular dysfunction in this group of patients, but to a failure of the baroreceptor response to volume depletion during hemodialysis.\r"

  ".U": "89355569\r", 
  ".W": "Since dialysis solutions in CAPD are now nearly aluminum free, the only source for elevated aluminum levels are aluminum-containing phosphate binders. Elimination with CAPD is insufficient to prevent aluminum accumulation. Therefore, we investigated a phosphate binder consisting of calcium alginate, a natural polyuronic acid, containing 100 mg calcium/g substance in 14 patients on CAPD over a period of one year. The patients had previously been treated with aluminum-containing phosphate binders for a period of 24.3 +/- 21.3 months. During a period of 3 weeks before changing to the new phosphate binder the mean (+/- SD) serum phosphorus concentration was 1.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, while at the end of one year of treatment with calcium alginate the concentration was 1.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/l. In order to lower serum phosphorus to this level, it was necessary to increase the mean (+/- SD) amount of calcium alginate from 6.9 +/- 1.3 g per day at the beginning of the study to 8.3 +/- 2.1 g per day at the end. The mean (+/- SD) serum calcium concentration did not change throughout the study period. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, 1.25 (OH)2 vitamin D3, and intact parathyroid hormone did not change as well. The mean (+/- SD) serum aluminum level declined from 36.0 +/- 20 to 14.0 +/- 11.3 micrograms/l after 6 months (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, calcium alginate is a good alternative to aluminum-containing phosphate binders and to phosphate binders on a calcium base as it does not lead to hypercalcemia. It prevents aluminum intoxication and has no serious side effects.\r"

Over the last seven years, 26 patients younger than 40 years of age were treated by anterior acromioplasty for subacromial impingement resistant to conservative therapy. The indication for surgery was failed conservative therapy in 17 patients. Six patients had impingement despite previous surgery, such as failed acromioplasty, biceps tenolysis, and biceps tenodesis. Two patients had impingement secondary to greater tuberosity malunion. The average duration of symptoms was 27 months and of conservative therapy, 17 months. All patients had a bursectomy and anterior acromioplasty. In addition, eight had a complete acromioclavicular arthroplasty for concurrent acromioclavicular arthritis, four had a modified acromioclavicular arthroplasty for impingement under the acromioclavicular joint, three had calcium excisions, and one had a rotator cuff repair. The greater tuberosity malunions were advanced in one patient and excised in one. The results were 81% (21) excellent and good, 15% (four) fair, and 4% (one) poor. The average follow-up period was 33 months. The majority of younger patients with subacromial impingement can be successfully treated conservatively. In those patients with persistent symptoms, open acromioplasty can reliably give good results with regard to pain and function.\r"

The subjects were tested at multiple isokinetic speeds and isometric angles. Regardless of age or gender, hip extensors were the strongest muscle group, following by flexors, adductors, abductors, and rotators. As the velocity of exercise increased, the magnitude of the torques produced decreased. Demographically, younger men produced the greatest torques and older women the lowest. The strength values of older men and younger women were similar. The results have clinical implications for objective assessment of strength in pathologic patient populations.\r"

In the presence of the large PMF variation, anatomic reduction and fixation allowed the femur to resist an average maximum load 57% greater than identical fractures with the fragment excluded. Fixation of the small PMF increased construct strength by an average of 17% over no fixation. The PMF is the keystone to mechanical stability for IT fractures of the femur.

These findings strongly suggest that revascularization is aborted by the subchondral fracture and collapse caused by weight bearing.

  ".W": "This paper documents the clinical course of the posterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee. By obtaining an understanding of the natural history of this lesion, the indications for surgical repair, reconstruction, and conservative treatment will be more clearly defined, and the clinician will be able to more critically evaluate the results of both acute repair and reconstruction of this ligament. Forty-three patients with an average interval of 6.3 years (range, one to 37 years) between injury and evaluation were included in this study. Fourteen patients had a straight unidirectional posterior instability and 29 had a combined multidirectional instability. The follow-up evaluation included functional assessment, physical and roentgenographic evaluation, arthrometric laxity measurement, and isokinetic dynametric testing of quadriceps function. Statistical treatment of the data, utilizing both nonparametric methods and logistic modeling, clearly delineated the natural history of the injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). It was established that the functional outcome can be predicted on the basis of the instability type. Specifically, those knees with PCL disruption without associated ligamentous laxity will probably remain symptom-free. However, when PCL disruption is associated with combined instabilities, a less than desirable functional result will probably occur. Application of logistic modeling to the data demonstrated that the functional result was not due to the type of instability per se, but rather to associated factors, i.e., chondromalacia of the patella, meniscal derangement, quadriceps atrophy, or degenerative changes. A direct correlation has been established between combined multidirectional instability and the occurrence of those associated secondary problems resulting in the patient's complaints and functional disability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arthroscopic observations of the grafts were divided into four types, excluding one rerupture case. Type I was observed in three knees less than six months after ACL reconstruction and in one knee six to 12 months after; Type II, in seven knees six to 12 months after; Type III, in six knees six to 12 months after, in 13 knees 12-18 months after, and in five knees more than 18 months after; and Type IV, in eight knees 12-18 months after and in 12 knees more than 18 months after. The types and the intervals after reconstruction were correlated with four phases of healing, including the maturation process of the implanted autogeneic grafts: (1) synovial envelopment, (2) fibrous tissue ingrowth, (3) transformation into ligamentlike tissue, and (4) hypertrophy or maturation of striated ligamentlike structure.\r"

  ".W": "In Greece, despite efforts toward early diagnosis of congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) during the last 20 years, treatment of 75% of infants so diagnosed has not been begun until they are 2 to 9 months of age, with an average treatment onset age of 4.6 months. Five hundred eighty-seven infants (947 hips) two to nine months of age with typical CDH or subluxation were treated with a specially designed abduction brace. This brace, which has been in use for more than 22 years, proved simple and reliable. The follow-up period ranged from two to 20 years (average, 4.5 years). Excellent results were found in 862 hips (91.0%), good results in 44 hips (4.5%), fair results in 32 hips (3.5%), and poor results in nine hips (1.0%). Changes due to ischemic necrosis were noted in 6.8% of the hips, with severe changes present in 3.0%. The most recent results have improved as a result of greater attention to very gentle and gradual abduction of the hips before the application of the brace and the avoidance of extreme abduction positioning in the brace.\r"

The purposes of the present investigation were to analyze the effect of femoral rotation on measurement of FC size and to determine if easily measured variables, such as manual caliper measurements, height, weight, and gender, are useful in matching donors and recipients. Three separate investigations were conducted to accomplish these purposes. The results indicated that femoral rotation has a significant negative effect on accurate sizing of the FC. Height and gender provide an acceptable prediction of femoral condyle size and can be used effectively in the donor selection process.\r"

Physical therapy consisted of regimented stretching exercises, quadriceps electrical stimulation, isometric quadriceps sets, ice application after treatment, progressive straight-leg raising, and short-arc quadriceps sets. After a disciplined progression of physical therapy and daily activity, patients were questioned about the amount of their knee dysfunction secondary to pain and their level of activity. Eighty-seven percent of these patients described their knee symptoms as improved immediately after a physical therapy program. Sixty-eight percent believed their symptoms were improved when reviewed at follow-up interview (mean duration, 16.0 months). All follow-up information was obtained via phone interview using a checksheet question form to eliminate subject bias. At the time of interview, 57% believed that their level of activity substantially increased from their level at initial evaluation. These data dictate that a trial of physical therapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication should be used as initial treatment for anterior knee pain.\r"

Factors affecting patella performance are the degree of congruity, the shear forces occurring due to tracking variations, and the excessive patellofemoral forces, particularly at higher flexion angles. A method was devised to load the patella with a constant force against the femoral component. The load was applied through a range of flexion. The deformation and wear patterns resembled those of retrieved clinical specimens. All-plastic components suffered from local deformation and underlying bone failure, whereas metal backing led to eventual penetration of the metal onto the femoral flange. Increased conformity of the patella component onto the femoral flange improved the situation for all-plastic and metal-backed designs by increasing the contact area and the available thickness of plastic.\r"

  ".W": "Plating of fractures results in osteopenia beneath the plate because of the stress-shielding effect. This study was performed to determine if a dynamic compression plate fixed to a bone with a low-density polyethylene underplate would loosen over time and with cyclic loading (due to creep and/or accumulated plastic deformation of the underplate) and thus decrease its stress shielding of the bone. Three groups of ten canine femora each were plated and tested in vitro. A nonosteotomized control group (without an underplate) and an experimental group (with an underplate) were cyclically loaded 10(6) times in compression under identical conditions. The third group of bones was osteotomized and plated with underplates and cyclically loaded 10(5) times to ensure that the construct would not fail before early fracture union could occur. The plate screws of the experimental group were significantly looser than those in the control group. This corresponded to a decrease in the underplate thickness that was more than sufficient to account for the looseness of the screws. Strain readings from the plate and bone were highly variable and not conclusive. Therefore, a transfer of load, reflected in the strain magnitude, from the plate to the bone during loosening of the screws could not be documented. None of the osteotomized bones in the third group had fixation failure. This experiment demonstrated that this plate-underplate construct provided strong initial fixation of an osteotomized bone in the laboratory setting without failure of fixation. This construct gradually loosened with time and cyclic loading in vitro and therefore should decrease the stress-shielding effect when applied in vivo.\r"

The present authors and their patients have been more than satisfied with the results of this procedure. With femoral shortening as the fundamental step, this method can be applied in high dislocations, as well as in cases of subluxation in which a pelvic osteotomy is indicated, to restore the depth of the acetabulum and to prevent undue pressure on the femoral head, which is the main cause of avascular necrosis, joint stiffness, and failures. Evaluation of the results is confusing but should rely on resistance of the hip in daily function, clinical appearance, range of hip motion, and the patient's opinion. Roentgenologic evaluation seems to be even more difficult, because numerous parameters need to be taken into consideration and correlated with the preoperative appearance of the hip. Certainly, it is reasonable to expect the majority of patients to develop osteoarthritic changes eventually, but nearly all patients can live a normal or satisfactory life for a number of years. The present authors are convinced that many patients will remain symptom-free for a long period.\r"

For larger pores, polyacetal nailing doubled the porosity, whereas steel nails increased porosity by a factor of 4.5. A slightly increased porosity was observed for the reamed group. Reduced cortical thickness was found in both nailed groups, whereas cortical thickness was increased in the reamed group compared with the control side. Implantation of rigid and flexible intramedullary nails in rat femora increased porosity along the anterior cortical wall.\r"

An estimate brings the total number of operations during a 20-year period to 9000 with a rate in recent years of 1000 per year. An early series of 143 arthroplasties (122 patients), mainly of the McKee-Farrar metal-to-metal technique, was reviewed. A final group of 52 arthroplasties, all primary prostheses of the McKee-Farrar type, were assessed with a follow-up period ranging from 12 to 20 years postoperatively. In the surviving cases, 53% were pain-free, and, in 79%, useful motion was maintained. The roentgenographic results were less satisfying but a fair roentgenographic picture did not preclude a good or very good clinical and functional outcome. Although the metal-to-metal technique now appears to be more of historic value, long-term results with this type of implant offer grounds for comparison with current cemented techniques.\r"

The infection rate was 9.6% in Group A hips, 4.7% in Group B hips, and inconsequential in Group C hips. The roentgenographic study included 96 asymptomatic hips with a follow-up period of six to 11 years (mean, 8.3%). A radiolucent line was present in the acetabulum in 40.6% of cases; cortical hypertrophy at the tip of the stem was present in 48.8% of cases.

The fractures are generally intraarticular and almost invariably involve the weight-bearing area of the acetabulum.

Fifty-eight displaced central acetabular fractures treated surgically were followed from one to 12 years. They were evaluated by anteroposterior and oblique roentgenograms and classified according to the Judet-Letournel system. Although surgical treatment was somewhat delayed and the experience in approaching and dealing with these fractures was limited in many of the early cases, excellent or satisfactory reduction to a less than 3-mm displacement at the articular surface was achieved in 81% of cases. A close agreement was found between the quality of surgical reduction and clinical results as well as between roentgenographic and clinical results at the final follow-up examination, which were satisfactory in 72% and 74%, respectively. The surgical complications were infection in 2% of cases, peroneal nerve palsy in 8.5%, and moderate to severe ectopic ossification in 10% of the patients.\r"

The first successful digital replantation was performed in 1979 on a female patient with multiple digit amputations; only the little finger was successfully replanted. More than 310 replantations and revascularization procedures have been performed during the past decade, mainly in two major replantation centers, with an overall success rate of 85% for complete and 90% for incomplete nonviable amputations.

(2) Spinal stenosis cases of acquired type are the most common while those of developmental character are very rare, only two in this series, (3) Surgical intervention, which is the treatment of choice, includes a generous decompressive procedure that must free all the neural elements. Sometimes it is necessary to remove part or all of the facets in one or more levels. (4) The rate of complications is low, and complications are of minor character. (5) The results on the whole are very satisfactory and lasting, provided the planning and execution of the operation are based on sound preoperative assessment using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation.

Sixty-five patients from Group A and 83 (85 shoulders) from Group B were reexamined. There were two recurrences in Group A and three in Group B. In Group A, lateral rotation of the arm was restored in 19 of the 65 patients; it was increased in 44 patients by 60 degrees to 70 degrees compared with immediate postoperative rotation, which was 20 degrees to 30 degrees from the neutral position. On anatomic specimens in which the classic Putti-Platt technique was used, lateral rotation could not reach neutral without disruption of the lateral stump from the labrum. Since the lateral stump of the subscapularis is tendinous and inelastic, the postoperative increase in lateral rotation among Group A patients could be explained if the lateral stump had become gradually detached from the labrum. Therefore, it seems that this difficult part of the classic Putti-Platt procedure may be omitted, rendering the operation simpler and shorter than the original technique but just as successful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 142 followed. 41 cases were of the unconstrained type (Marmor, Bechtol, and Oxford), while 101 cases were of the constrained type (St. Georg hinge and Endo-Model). In the unconstrained group, two infected cases were encountered (one cured, one fused) and three loosenings requiring revision. Prompt and intensive physiotherapy was necessary in this younger and less affected group of patients in order to achieve a functioning knee joint. The average improvement of range of motion was 15 degrees. In the constrained group, full restoration of the normal axis was achieved with full extension; flexion was greater than 100 degrees, and there was a stable joint. Three infections occurred, all in rheumatoid patients. There were two early deaths from unrelated causes. Three late dislocations of the patella, with the knees still functioning, were encountered in this older group of patients with more severely affected joints. Proper function of the unconstrained prosthesis is also questionable in relation to the average geometry of the artificial models in use and the geometry of the human body. This relation, if not accurate, might result in loosening even in a well-installed prosthesis. The constrained artificial joint possessing its own mechanism of function allows full restoration of the leg axis and early ambulation and weight bearing, which are essential for the elderly. Bearing in mind the method of fixation, the function, and the results of the prosthesis used, the implantation of a constrained prosthesis more suitable to the elderly is strongly advised.\r"

Of 63 patients, 55 were followed from six to 49 months postoperatively (mean, 23 months). Good or excellent results were obtained in 64% of the patients and in 70% of the non-Workers' Compensation patients. Eighty-five percent of the patients and 91% of the non-Workers' Compensation patients were satisfied with the results of surgery. Eighty-seven percent of the patients returned to their original work status. An average of only 1 mm of disc space height was lost. Only two (4%) disc spaces spontaneously fused. ACFID is indicated for radiculopathy due to both soft and hard discs and can be particularly valuable in treating patients with disc herniation adjacent to a previous fusion or radiculopathy with multiple-level myelographic filling defects.\r"

Ninety-three (69.9%) failed one or more parts of the screening procedure. Twenty-two children (7.9% of the total group) had abnormal hearing acuity, 33 (30.6%) abnormal speech discrimination in noise, and 73 (62.4%) abnormal short term auditory memory. These figures are significantly higher than those found in a representative sample of school children. Not one of 16 items from parent and teacher questionnaires and neurodevelopmental findings predicted auditory acuity or speech in noise problems; there were correlations between short term auditory memory items and parental and teacher rating of a language problem, teacher rating of reading and sequencing problem, and neurodevelopmental finding of auditory sequencing problem. In view of this inability to clinically predict auditory processing deficits, the authors suggest that a full audiological assessment, including short term memory and speech in noise testing, is warranted as part of the evaluation of children with learning difficulties.\r"

However, it has been proposed that cholera toxin promotes secretion in vivo mainly through an indirect mechanism involving enteric neural reflexes. 2. We examined this hypothesis further by studying the influence of neuronal blockade on cholera toxin-induced changes in fluid transport across rabbit ileum in vitro. Mucosa, stripped of muscle layers, was mounted in flux chambers and luminal application of crude cholera toxin (2 micrograms/ml) caused a delayed but sustained rise in the short-circuit current, electrical potential difference and Cl- secretion. Pretreatment with the nerve-blocking drug, tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-6) mol/l serosal side), failed to influence the secretory response to cholera toxin, and addition of tetrodotoxin at the peak response to cholera toxin also had no effect. 3. That tetrodotoxin could block neurally mediated secretagogues was confirmed by the demonstration that the electrical responses to neurotensin (10(-7) mol/l and 10(-8) mol/l) were blocked by tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-6) mol/l). Furthermore, the response to cholera toxin of segments of ileum, which included the myenteric, submucosal and mucosal nerve plexuses, was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin. 4. We conclude that cholera toxin-induced secretion in rabbit ileum in vitro is not mediated via a neurological mechanism.\r"

The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the dominant quadriceps and plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25-(OH)D] were measured in male alcoholics and control subjects to determine whether vitamin D deficiency contributed to proximal muscle weakness. 3. In both groups MVC declined with age and was related to body build. The distribution of plasma 25-(OH)D was skewed in alcoholics, with the mean significantly lower than in control subjects. Seventeen per cent of patients (but none of the control subjects) had pronounced biochemical deficiency [plasma 25-(OH)D less than 10 nmol/l]. 4. Alcoholics were significantly weaker than control subjects, even after correcting for the effects of age, height and weight. The severity of associated liver disease (cirrhosis vs no cirrhosis) did not influence muscle strength. Variation in plasma 25-(OH)D and albumin made an insignificant contribution to the difference in MVC observed between patients and control subjects. 5. We conclude that proximal muscle strength is reduced in chronic alcoholism but that this is not due to associated vitamin D [25-(OH)D] deficiency or alcoholic cirrhosis.\r"

Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) have been evaluated for their capacities to modulate neutrophil (PMN) migration and endothelial cell adherence using compounds prepared by total chemical synthesis. 2. Increased PMN migration was seen with concentrations of LXA4 from 10(-9) mol/l to 10(-7) mol/l. LXA4 was 100-fold less potent than leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and it elicited only one-half of the maximal response of LTB4. 3. The (5S,6S,15S)-isomer of LXA4 induced only a weak migratory response and LXB4 was inactive, suggesting that the activity of LXA4 was stereospecific. 4. Modified chequerboard analysis indicated that LXA4 was a chemokinetic agent. 5. Preincubation of PMN with increasing concentrations of LXA4 induced a very similar dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the subsequent response to 10(-7) mol/l LTB4 or 10(-7) mol/l N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP). The inhibition was observed at 10(-10) mol/l LXA4; the concentration which produced 50% inhibition was 10(-8) mol/l and 100% inhibition of PMN locomotion occurred at 10(-6) mol/l LXA4. 6. The (5S,6S,15S)-isomers of LXA4 and LXB4 were 5- and 100-fold less potent than LXA4, respectively, in suppressing LTB4- or FMLP-induced PMN migration. 7. Preincubation of PMN with LXA4 led to a suppression of calcium mobilization, as assessed by Quin2-AM fluorescence, when the cells were subsequently stimulated under optimal conditions by LTB4 or FMLP. 8. These results suggest that the inhibitory activity of lipoxins may be related to the capacity of these molecules to regulate calcium ion mobilization.\r"

  ".W": "1. Myographic and histological techniques were used to study the mechanical and morphological properties of oesophageal and mesenteric veins from rabbits subjected to 0, 4, 14 and 90 days of partial portal vein stenosis. 2. The stenosis caused an immediate increase in portal pressure from 10.5 mmHg (1.4 kPa) to 20.5 mmHg (2.7 kPa); the pressure returned to the control level by 90 days. 3. The lumen diameter of oesophageal veins was increased by 76% after 4 days and by 147% after 90 days, while that of the mesenteric veins was unchanged. The media thickness in both veins increased rapidly, reaching a maximum at 14 days (82%, oesophageal; 56%, mesenteric) and thereafter decreasing. 4. The contractility of oesophageal veins was transiently decreased (at 4 days), while that of the mesenteric veins was transiently increased (at 14 days). 5. In further experiments, sclerosing of the oesophagus, which is believed to restrict flow without reducing pressure, restricted the increase in lumen diameter of oesophageal veins caudal to the sclerosing site, but did not affect the media thickness. 6. The results suggest that, in oesophageal and mesenteric veins, portal pressure is a primary determinant of media thickness but not of lumen diameter.\r"

When the temperature was decreased to 20 degrees C and 9 degrees C, K+ passive permeability markedly increased and Na+ permeability remained unchanged in these patients. In contrast, in control subjects a reduction in temperature caused a marked reduction in Na+ and K+ passive permeability. 4. These findings could account for the marked increase in plasma K+ concentration observed at subphysiological temperatures. 5. The Na+-K+ co-transport pathway was reduced in all members of the family, but the Na+-K+ pump was reduced in only two of them. These alterations were independent from the pseudohyperkalaemic state.\r"

When compared with normotensive subjects, hypertensive patients in baseline conditions showed a reduced excretion of urinary prostaglandin E2 associated with an excessive prostaglandin F2 alpha production. 3. Potassium canrenoate significantly reduced mean blood pressure in hypertensive patients [from 118.9 +/- 8.7 mmHg (1.62 +/- 0.12 kPa) to a peak minimum value of 104.7 +/- 9.8 mmHg (1.42 +/- 0.13 kPa) on the seventh day of treatment; P less than 0.01 for the whole period] but not in control subjects [from 88 +/- 9.4 mmHg (1.20 +/- 0.13 kPa) to 84.3 +/- 8.3 mmHg (1.15 +/- 0.11 kPa) on the eighth day, NS] even though potassium canrenoate significantly increased sodium excretion in both groups. Renal prostaglandin excretion was affected differently in the two groups: in control subjects excretion of both prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha was increased after drug administration, whereas in hypertensive patients only prostaglandin E2 excretion was enhanced.\r"

Baroreflex sensitivity was measured in 48 untreated subjects of mean age 43 (range 20-71) years with blood pressures ranging from 104 to 202 mmHg (13.9 to 26.9 kPa) systolic and 52 to 120 mmHg (6.9 to 16.0 kPa) diastolic [average 142/87 mmHg (18.9/11.6 kPa)]. Both systolic and diastolic pressures correlated with age (r = 0.53, P less than 0.001 and r = 0.44, P less than 0.01). 4. Baroreflex sensitivity determined throughout respiration was log-normally distributed with a median value of 2.24 ms/mmHg, which declined with age (r = -0.63, P less than 0.001). 5. After allowing for the effects of age, baroreflex sensitivity throughout respiration was not independently related to either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.\r"

The strongest response was induced by the hemiketal form of 1-O-methyl-4,5-dihydroniveusin A. The STL content of 50 capitate glands was sufficient to elicit a remarkable response in the guinea pigs. Thus, touching a sunflower plant (with up to 1000 capitate glands per cm2) may lead to the release of sufficient STL to sensitize humans, and these substances can be considered to be responsible for the cases of allergic contact dermatitis described in sunflower growers since 1906.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of the natural permeability of the stratum corneum to water, and the changes in that permeability effected by a single patch test, were investigated as parameters to predict the susceptibility of the skin to repeated exposures of an irritant. One site on the forearm skin of 27 non-atopic healthy subjects was exposed to a 0.5% concentration of sodium lauryl sulphate by a single occlusive 24-h patch. Another site was exposed to a twice daily 4-day repeated occlusive patch with the same irritant solution. The effects were evaluated by transepidermal water loss measurements made prior to the applications (baseline) on day 1 (BASE), following the single 24-h patch on day 2 (SINGL), and following the 4-day repeated applications on day 5 (REPET). Individuals with higher BASE had higher SINGL (R = 0.80, P less than 0.001) and higher REPET (R = 0.76, P less than 0.001). There was also a significant linear correlation between SINGL and REPET (R = 0.63, P less than 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis of results, however, indicated that a high baseline TEWL is better indication of an individual's increased susceptibility (high REPET) to weak irritants than a high TEWL value following a single 24-h patch test. Baseline TEWL may therefore be used as a reasonably accurate preliminary \"predictive\" screening test for susceptibility to irritants.\r"

Prick tests performed on 16 different condom brands showed that 4 brands caused positive reactions in 52-67% of patients. The remaining 12 brands were not as allergenic and 1 brand was totally negative on prick testing. 1 highly allergenic condom brand was examined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), which showed similar protein profiles to those detectable in latex gloves and natural rubber. These results show that, in addition to rubber gloves and balloons, condoms should also be considered as possible sources of latex, and that patients with LGCU should be advised to avoid condoms.\r"

A comparison is made between the medical and employment status of a cohort of workers engaged, or who had been engaged, in the manufacture of prefabricated concrete building components in 1981 and in 1987. Workers who had allergic cement eczema in 1981 appeared to show no improvement 6 years after the reduction of chromate in the cement. Improvement was seen, however, in the eczema of those workers with irritant cement eczema. The 1987 study showed that a larger number of chromate-sensitized workers required medical services and topical steroid treatment than did those who were not sensitized to chromate. This difference was statistically significant. The worse medical prognosis of the chromate-sensitized workers could in part be due to the fact that some of these had secondary contact sensitivity to cobalt and rubber chemicals. The chromate-sensitized workers also took earlier retirement. Younger workers with allergic and irritant cement eczema continued to work and their employment status was not influenced by chromate sensitization.\r"

Parameters studied included spontaneous respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and PaO2/FiO2. Two hundred forty-one patients (mean age 80 yr) were successfully weaned while 28 patients (mean age 80 yr) required reinstitution of MVS within 48 h. MIP and pH were statistically lower in the unsuccessfully weaned group, although the mean absolute differences were small (-32 vs. -38 cm H2O and 7.42 vs. 7.44 cm H2O, respectively). All parameters had good positive predictive values but poor negative predictive values (less than or equal to 22%) and only marginal diagnostic accuracy (58% to 86%). We conclude that strict adherence to previously published weaning parameters may not be applicable in deciding when to discontinue MVS in elderly patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to obtain a more precise understanding of the rate of metabolic normalization or decrease of endogenously produced lactate in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The differential kinetics of lactate metabolism are of clinical interest. Male volunteer patients with hepatic cirrhosis (n = 7), who had survived acute hospitalization, were compared to healthy age-matched males with normal liver function (n = 7). After arterial cannulation, bicycle ergometry was performed at a workload of 25 watts (W); the load was increased by increments of 25 W at 2-min intervals to maximum aerobic capacity. Lactate was measured in arterial blood before, at 4-min intervals during, and on a minimum of 11 occasions in the 30 to 70 min after exercise. The time interval during which lactate declined linearly to half its maximal concentration (Lt50) was graphically computed. The Lt50 was 34.8 +/- 4.5 min (mean +/- SEM) in the experimental group and 14.1 +/- 1.3 min in the control subjects (p less than .005). Lactate disappears from the bloodstream almost three times more slowly in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The implication for interpretation of changes in lactate during circulatory shock in the presence of liver dysfunction is addressed.\r"

Flosequinan was added to conventional therapy at 3.8 +/- 0.5 days after infarction in the form of a single 100-mg oral dose. Hemodynamic measurements were performed every hour for 4 h after administration, without any other drug being added. The nitrate infusion rate was kept constant. Flosequinan produced hemodynamic improvement in this group. The effect peaked at 1 to 2 h and remained at this level at 4 h. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 27.2 +/- 5.4 to 16.4 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, and cardiac output increased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 to 4.1 +/- 0.4 L/min (p less than .001 for both). Cardiac index, stroke index, and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly increased. Pulmonary arterial and right atrial pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were also significantly reduced. Heart rate was not significantly altered. Mean systemic arterial pressure was slightly reduced. Flosequinan administration was not associated with symptomatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, or other adverse events, and the hemodynamic effect was not related to the pretreatment serum sodium concentration. We conclude that flosequinan is effective in producing acute hemodynamic improvement in patients with heart failure complicating acute MI resistant to conventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 77 consecutive patients submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV) for greater than 48 h in a respiratory ICU (RICU) were studied to investigate the incidence, etiology, and consequences of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Eighteen (23%) patients developed a bacterial pneumonia after 5.6 +/- 1.0 days (mean +/- SEM; range 2 to 17) of MV. Three additional cases were demonstrated at autopsy, raising the incidence to 27%. Overall, the mean duration of MV increased from 9.7 +/- 0.9 to 32.2 +/- 5.1 days (p less than .0001) when pneumonia developed. A longer period of hospital stay before RICU admission and the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significant characteristics of patients with pneumonia when compared to patients without nosocomial pulmonary infection. One or more etiological agents were identified in 14 patients from the pneumonia group by means of a highly specific technique (protected brush catheter, transthoracic needle aspiration, pleural fluid, and/or blood cultures). The predominant pathogens isolated were Gram-negative bacilli (Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp.). Half of the cases were polymicrobial. Compared to other series, our results may reflect with more accuracy the actual incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients, since we used highly accurate techniques along with autopsy findings which allowed us to confirm or discard the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.\r"

In surgical neonates with congenital malformations, prolonged intubation with a nasotracheal (NT) or NG tube is often necessary, but sinusitis with complicating sepsis is seldom reported. Sinus x-rays may confirm the diagnosis; in infancy, prolonged nasal intubation delays the pneumatization of the sinuses and the mastoids, resulting in additional diagnostic problems. In a 1-yr period, we saw three patients with multiple septic episodes in which the source of sepsis was undetectable. Despite the absence of clinical symptoms and radiologic evidence of sinusitis or mastoiditis, surgical drainage revealed pus and led to the disappearance of septic episodes and ear, nose, and throat problems. There is an association between prolonged NT and NG intubation, and sinusitis or mastoiditis as an unrecognized source of sepsis in young infants. Absence of radiologic evidence of sinusitis or mastoiditis causes pitfalls in diagnosis and is related to delayed pneumatization of the sinuses and the mastoid in prolonged nasal intubation in young infants.\r"

Our study indicates that: a) lower K and Cl levels and higher Na levels than those found in plasma are common to both nasal and bronchial secretions; b) variations of electrolyte levels in nasal secretions are interrelated; c) patients with lower values of free-water clearance show lower Na and higher Cl levels in nasal secretions, possibly due to increased epithelial transport; d) the amount of K in nasal secretions appears correlated with its urinary fractional excretion (this could be explained by the variations in intracellular K levels); and e) in hyperchloremic patients, plasma/secretion differences of Na are decreased, possibly due to decreased epithelial transport.\r"

Intravascular pressure, hemodynamic variables, and oxygen transport variables were measured simultaneously. During hemorrhage, PscO2 was the first of the PO2 measurements, and among the first set of hemodynamic variables that differed significantly from control values. During continuous bleeding, PscO2 and PcjO2 fell rapidly, the decline of PscO2 and PcjO2 was similar and significantly higher than that found for PtcO2. After reinfusion of shed blood, PscO2 was the last of PO2 measurements, and among the last set of hemodynamic variables, to return to control values. While PaO2 remained constant, PvO2 decreased significantly during hemorrhage and normalized during resuscitation. Unheated instruments for measuring PscO2 and PcjO2 are reliable indicators of peripheral perfusion during hemorrhage and resuscitation. Subcutaneous oxygen monitoring, in particular, seems capable of assessing early blood loss and adequacy of resuscitation after acute hemorrhage, and may be clinically useful.\r"

Lungs ventilated at a VT of 18 ml/kg gained significantly more weight at 30 through 90 min than did lungs ventilated at 6 ml/kg. These differences in weight gain were not associated with differences in the evolution of thromboxane B2 in the perfusate. The impact of VT on lung water and outcome in patients with lung injury deserves further study.\r"

Since HV and HT may contribute to significant patient morbidity, we evaluated the effects of these treatments in combination on CBF, CMRO2, and cross-brain oxygen extraction (CBO2) using the Kety-Schmidt technique before controlled bleeding to alter blood viscosity in 20 lightly anesthetized, paralyzed cats, and after bleeding in another 17 cats. The degree of HV (PaCO2 24 to 26 torr) and HT (32 degrees and 30 degrees C) used were representative of that employed in pediatric neurointensive care. HV at normothermia resulted in a significant decline in CBF (P less than .05) and an unchanged CMRO2. HV and HT together to 32 degrees C resulted in a further significant fall in CBF and CMRO2 (p less than .05), but an unchanged CBO2. Further cooling of the animal to 30 degrees C during HV, both before and after controlled bleeding, resulted in no further significant fall in CBF, CBO2, or CMRO2. This relationship was found despite a significant fall in Hgb (p less than .001), suggesting that blood viscosity did not significantly influence CBF at this temperature. Our data suggest that HT to 32 degrees C during HV may have therapeutic benefit by decreasing CBF and CMRO2, but further cooling to 30 degrees C may not result in further cerebral protective effects.\r"

Mean +/- SD accuracy values were -9.4 +/- 6.4% (range -29.1 to -0.7), 0.5 +/- 2.2% (range -4.2 to 6.3), and -0.5 +/- 4.7% (range -8.5 to 9.9) of the desired rate for the Abbott, IVAC, and Travenol devices, respectively. Back-pressure was the only factor to influence significantly flow accuracy for the Abbott device (r = .81). All factors significantly influenced accuracy for the Travenol device (r = .55). No factor influenced accuracy for the IVAC infusion pump. Both the IVAC 560 and Travenol 6200 have acceptable flow accuracy values within the range of study factors examined.

  ".W": "We describe the clinical course and pleural fluid findings in patients with AIDS-associated pleural KS and survival analysis of cases from the Colorado registry with and without pleuropulmonary KS. Twenty-one of 105 (20 percent) of AIDS cases with KS had pleuropulmonary involvement with KS and 13 (62 percent) had pleural effusions. All cases were homosexual males with cutaneous lesions of KS that antedated pleural involvement by several months. Clinical presentation and physical examination findings were nonspecific. Chest roentgenograms generally showed nonloculated bilateral pleural effusions; concurrent parenchymal infiltrates were present in 90 percent. Pleural fluid analysis showed that most effusions were serosanguineous, mononuclear cell-predominant exudates. Pleural fluid was visibly blood-tinged in nine of ten cases, with median RBC counts of 52,000/microliters (range 16,000 to 803,000/microliters). Cytologic examination of pleural fluid or needle biopsy of the parietal pleura failed to establish the diagnosis. In two cases the effusions were chylous. Postmortem examination of the lungs typically showed multiple cherry red to purple lesions on the visceral but not parietal pleural surface. In half the cases progressive pleural effusions led to significant morbidity or mortality. Systemic chemotherapy for disseminated KS was minimally effective; chest tube thoracostomy with attempted tetracycline sclerosis was unsuccessful in controlling pleural effusions in three cases. Median survival from diagnosis of KS to death was 205 and 338 days, respectively, for patients with and without pleuropulmonary KS (p less than 0.01). Pleural effusions are common in AIDS-associated pleuropulmonary KS, and finding a serosanguineous exudative effusion in an AIDS patient with cutaneous KS is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of pleural KS.\r"

The COS-5 appeared to respond appropriately at respiratory rates between 15 and 45, even when there were minimal pressure changes at the nose. There was an excellent correlation in PaO2 at equivalent flow settings during the exercise in the patients with COPD and IPF. There were six instances (in four patients) of the 31 comparisons in which the PaO2 differed by more than 5 mm Hg. The PaO2 was higher with continuous oxygen delivery on two occasions in a patient with COPD who utilized pursed-lip breathing during the exercise. The PaO2 was higher with COS-5 delivery on two occasions in a patient with IPF who was breathing at the highest respiratory rates (44 and 45/min) during the exercise.\r"

  ".W": "It is a common practice for some clinicians to obtain a chest roentgenogram immediately following FOB in an attempt to detect complications of the procedure, particularly pneumothorax; however, the roentgenogram adds substantially to the cost of FOB. It was our clinical impression that the diagnostic and therapeutic value of immediate chest roentgenography was minimal. Therefore, we reviewed 130 chest roentgenograms taken immediately after bronchoscopy that were obtained over 36 months. One hundred fourteen (88 percent) were unchanged from the most recent roentgenogram before bronchoscopy. Ten (8 percent) showed an increase in alveolar infiltrate due to bronchoalveolar lavage or hemorrhage. Five (4 percent) had changes presumably unrelated to the procedure. Only one patient had a pneumothorax on the roentgenogram taken immediately after bronchoscopy; however, the patient was symptomatic, and the pneumothorax was detected by fluoroscopy prior to the chest roentgenogram. Management of the patient's condition was not altered in a single case based upon findings on the chest roentgenogram. We conclude that the immediately postbronchoscopic chest roentgenogram rarely provides clinically useful information or detects a complication that is not suspected clinically; furthermore, it appears to have minimal impact, if any, on the management of a patient's condition.\r"

  ".U": "89356031\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the interaction between respiration and sleep in ten male outpatients with severe, stable, maximally treated congestive heart failure (CHF). Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), defined as periodic breathing with apnea or hypopnea, was found in all patients with a mean duration of 120 +/- 87 minutes [50.2 +/- 34.4 percent total sleep time (TST)]. The CSR was found predominantly during stage 1 (20.6 +/- 6.7 percent TST) and stage 2 (25.8 +/- 6 percent TST) NREM sleep and occurred rarely during slow wave sleep (SWS) (1.6 +/- 1 percent TST) and REM sleep (1.6 +/- 0.5 percent TST). All apneas and hypopneas were central. Despite normal awake arterial oxygenation (SaO2) (96.1 +/- 1.6 percent), significant, severe hypoxemia was found during sleep in seven patients with SaO2 less than 90 percent for 9 to 59 percent TST (mean +/- SD, 23 +/- 23 percent TST), and this was significantly related to the duration of CSR (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05). The mean minimum SaO2 for sleep stage was lowest during stage 1 (82.1 percent +/- 2.6 percent) and stage 2 (78.9 percent +/- 2.8 percent) NREM sleep, intermediate during REM sleep (84.5 percent +/- 1.8 percent) and highest during SWS (87.6 percent +/- 2.7 percent). Sleep was disrupted to a variable extent in all patients with a short mean TST (287 +/- 106 minutes), a high proportion of stage 1 sleep (26 +/- 19 percent TST), virtual absence of SWS (5 +/- 7 percent TST) which was found in only four patients, and a high number of sleep stage changes (30 +/- 27/hour) and arousals (28 +/- 25/hour). Arousals occurred predominantly during stage 1 (17 +/- 20/hour) and stage 2 (10 +/- 7/hour) NREM sleep and the majority immediately followed the hyperpneic phase of CSR. The amount of CSR (percent TST) was inversely related to the length of TST (r = -0.73, p less than 0.05), and directly related to the number of sleep stage changes (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01) and the number of arousals (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05). We conclude that in severe, stable CHF, CSR occurs predominantly during light sleep, that despite normal awake arterial oxygen saturation, significant hypoxemia may develop during sleep due to CSR, and that sleep is unstable and disrupted due to frequent arousals caused by the hyperpneic phase of CSR. These sequelae of CSR may be important determinants of the clinical status and outcome of patients with severe CHF.\r"

At week 6, if SDAP was greater than 95 mm Hg, minoxidil (M), 5.5 mg/day, was added. The patients were seen every two weeks to week 16 (end of drug titration) and then every four weeks to week 32. The dosages were increased to 200 mg/day for A, 80 mg/day for B, and 20 mg/day for M as needed. Physical examinations, chest x-ray films, ECGs, echocardiograms, spirometric studies, 24-h ambulatory arterial pressures (AAP), and blood chemistry analyses were done at baseline and during treatment. A and B combined with a diuretic (furosemide, F) and M decreased the arterial pressures and heart rates equally well by both clinical and AAP measurements (p less than .001). The IVS was decreased (p less than .05), whereas LVIDd, RVIDd, and cardiothoracic ratios were increased by both A and B (p less than .05, p less than .01). No changes were noted in LVPW, LVM, EF, FS, spirometric values, or blood chemistry analyses. Common side effects were weight gain, edema, and hypertrichosis. Once-daily administration of A or B in combination with F and M were effective in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension. Although effective, prolonged use of M may lead to volume overload and cardiomegaly. The significance of these latter findings is not yet known.\r"

Of 14 symptomatic family members, 12 had serum IgE concentrations less than 5 IU/ml. Four had values less than 1 IU/ml. Serum IgE was greater than 10 IU/ml in all nine asymptomatic individuals. Inheritance of low IgE appeared to be autosomal dominant, with variable penetrance. IgA was low normal (70-90 mg/dl) in three individuals. Two of these were IgE deficient. One symptomatic child had unmeasurable IgG2 (less than 10 mg/dl) and IgE (less than 0.5 IU/ml). This kindred demonstrates that IgE deficiency can be familial, and associated with sinopulmonary disease.\r"

C0 and C0.5 (Cdyn at the frequency of zero and 0.5 Hz, respectively) were computed using the regression line of Cdyn versus frequency measured at the fundamental and first three harmonics in each breathing cycle. First, the validity of this system was tested by comparing Rl, C0 and C0.5 during five consecutive breaths with those obtained by the conventional method. A good correlation was seen in Rl, C0 and C0.5 between the two methods. Second, we studied airway response to allergen inhalation before and after oral administration of a long-acting beta 2-stimulant (procaterol, 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms) or placebo in a double-blind crossover trial in six atopic asthmatic subjects. In control allergen inhalation tests by administration of placebo, Rl increased progressively, and C0.5, expressed as percentage of control compliance at zero frequency (C0.5/COcont), decreased progressively. After 100 micrograms procaterol, Rl response to allergen was almost completely inhibited. However, a decrease in C0.5/C0cont was still observed. These findings suggest that pretreatment of asthmatic patients with procaterol can release allergen-induced bronchoconstriction of the central airways, but cannot release that of the peripheral airways.\r"

Certain technical considerations were employed which resulted in a low complication rate of 4.8 percent. Pneumothorax occurred in only eight cases (4 percent). There were eight false-negative biopsies and no false-positives. The key advantage of large needle biopsy (LNB) over skinny needle biopsy (SNB) is that a large tissue core is obtained that allows for more specific histologic diagnosis. With proper technique and careful patient and lesion selection, LNB can be performed as safely as thin-needle biopsy.\r"

A recently developed cytotoxicity assay, specific for detection of TNF activity, was applied. This study demonstrates that (1) unstimulated mononuclear phagocytes released low levels of TNF with no differences between groups; (2) when effector cells were stimulated with LPS, AMs from patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis released more TNF than AMs recovered from normal subjects and from patients with inactive disease; (3) this increase was compartmentalized to the lungs, since comparisons of TNF production by LPS-stimulated BMs failed to show any difference between study groups. These results suggest that TNF might play a role in the pathogenesis of the alveolitis of pulmonary sarcoidosis.\r"

We compared the reproducibility of the two tests. There were no significant differences found in the mean max loads in the three incremental tests, or in the endurance times in the three tlim tests. However, the intraindividual coefficients of variation of max load in the incremental test (0 to 14 percent) were much smaller than the intraindividual coefficients of variation of endurance time in the tlim test (20 to 65 percent). We found that the large variability in endurance time in our tlim tests was most likely accounted for by variability in breathing pattern, inspiratory flow rate and breath-by-breath mouth pressure generation. Differences in these parameters did not, however, explain why in the tlim test a given subject could tolerate for 19 minutes a load only 100 g less than that which he was unable to tolerate for two minutes in the incremental test. These findings emphasize the differences between these two tests of respiratory muscle endurance. Since there was less intraindividual variability in the two-minute incremental threshold loading test, we suggest that this test may be more useful than the tlim test.\r"

The vasomotor mechanism is unknown. We suspected that decreased distensibility of the large pulmonary arteries was one probable effect of the drug. If present, reduced distensibility would explain many of the hemodynamic alterations produced by almitrine. To test this idea, we measured the diameter of the right pulmonary artery during systole and diastole both before and after almitrine administration in nine patients who were undergoing pulmonary cineangiography. Our calculations of the distensibility of the right pulmonary artery showed that almitrine caused a 60 percent decrease. This significant alteration in the stiffness of the large pulmonary arteries can account for the rise in systolic pressure, a change that would be expected to redistribute pulmonary blood flow upwards and thereby improve ventilation-perfusion balance.\r"

Ventilation was monitored using respiratory inductive plethysmography and swallowing was recorded by submental electromyogram. Swallowing occurred almost exclusively in expiration. Two hundred and seventy-one swallows were seen and only two occurred in inspiration. The mean expiratory duration (Te) of breaths containing a swallow was significantly greater than the mean Te of all breaths during the same period. There was no change in mean tidal volume (VT), inspiratory duration (Ti), expiratory duration (Te), mean inspiratory flow (VT/Ti) or minute ventilation (VE) between the periods of normal breathing, eating and drinking. However, breathing became more irregular during eating and drinking. The mean coefficient of variation of VT, Te, and VT/Ti was significantly greater during eating and drinking than at rest. The coefficient of variation for VT was 22 + 3 percent, 36 +/- 5 percent, and 41 +/- 5 percent during the initial period of resting breathing, eating and drinking. For VT/Ti it was 24 +/- 6 percent, 43 +/- 14 percent and 44 +/- 8 percent during resting breathing, eating and drinking. We conclude that swallowing is almost exclusively an expiratory activity. This may play a protective role in preventing aspiration. Although the level of ventilation is maintained constant during eating and drinking, the pattern of breathing becomes increasingly irregular. This may contribute to dyspnea during meals in some patients with lung disease.\r"

The present study was designed to replicate the previous one with a much larger population, analyze the perceptual characteristics of the speech quality, and determine the degree to which each of three descriptors of speech abnormality contributed to the perception of speech abnormality. Ten graduate students in speech pathology listened in two 1.5 hour sessions to 252 random speech samples presented on a master tape. There were 81 subjects comprised of 27 sleep apnea patients, 27 matched chronic obstructive pulmonary disease control patients, and 27 matched normal control subjects. Rating the speech along an equally-appearing interval scale from 1 to 7, the judges heard abnormal resonance, articulation or phonation in 74 percent of the sleep apnea subjects, 53 percent of the COPD subjects, and 7 percent of the normal subjects (significant difference by chi 2 test at the .01 level of confidence). Discriminant function equations based on these speech descriptors correctly identified 96.3 percent of the normal subjects and 63.0 percent of the sleep apnea subjects. Analysis of abnormal speech resonance, articulation and phonation may identify obstructive sleep apnea or may provide insight into its pathology.\r"

We studied the relationship of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the clinical severity of asthma in 54 asthmatic subjects. In order to find out whether measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness could be used to predict future symptomatic status and requirements for drugs, ten patients were followed for three months. We found that there was no correlation between the clinical severity of asthma and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and, also, that the latter could not be used as a prognostic indicator of future symptomatic status and drug requirements. Measurement of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, therefore, adds little to the assessment and management of asthma.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 was comprised of nine patients with a resting left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 140 ml or more, and group 2 was comprised of nine patients with a left ventricular end-diastolic volume less than 140 ml. The QS2 and heart rate had an linear inverse relation during exercise, and DT and heart rate had an nonlinear inverse relation (DT = e(7.27-0.0166 x heart rate) and DT = e(7.11-0.0142 x heart rate) for groups 1 and 2, respectively). Significant prolongation of the QS2 with consequent shortening of DT (p less than 0.05) was observed in group 1. Thus, in addition to a larger decrease in DT with a small change in heart rate, particularly during low-level exercise, patients with increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume have a potential for initiating subendocardial ischemia which results in further prolongation of systole and, hence, greater abbreviation of DT.\r"

Toxic oxygen metabolites have been implicated in this clinical condition and in animal models of pulmonary edema. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an oxygen metabolite, mediates tissue injury. We measured H2O2 levels by a spectrophotometric technique in the breath condensate of 68 mechanically ventilated patients; 13 patients with normal lungs undergoing elective surgery had no such detectable levels of H2O2. Fifty-five patients in the ICU meeting criteria for the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had a higher concentration of H2O2 in the expired breath condensate than ICU patients without pulmonary infiltrates (2.34 +/- 1.15 vs 0.99 +/- 0.72 mumol/L, p less than 0.005). This marker had a sensitivity of 87.5 percent and a specificity of 81.3 percent in separating the two patient populations. Patients with AHRF and focal pulmonary infiltrates who did not meet criteria for ARDS also had higher concentrations of H2O2 (2.45 +/- 1.55 mumol/L) than patients without pulmonary infiltrates (p less than 0.001). No difference was observed between the expired H2O2 concentrations of patients with ARDS or patients with focal pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with brain injury or sepsis tended to have higher levels of H2O2 regardless of lung pathology. Increased levels of H2O2 are detected in the expired breath of ICU patients with focal lung infiltrates and in ARDS patients, which is consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen metabolites participate in the pathogenesis of ARDS and other forms of AHRF.\r"

None of the patients had diabetes or hypertension, and all but one were cigarette smokers. The serum cholesterol level was 162 +/- 7 mg/dl. Four of the five patients who consented to coronary angiographic studies displayed normal coronary arteries, and one showed proximal stenosis of the right coronary artery. The cold pressor test was performed in seven patients; none had angina or ECG changes induced by cold stimulation. We conclude that T-wave infarction is a common form of an acute cardiac event related to cocaine abuse, and its pathogenesis may involve that of the cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm.\r"

This study reports results from a retrospective analysis of clinical, demographic, and treatment data collected during in-hospital CPR efforts in 123 patients in whom the initial rhythm was asystole. Twenty-eight (22.8 percent) of these patients were alive 24 h after CPR initiation. Patients who received norepinephrine drip (N = 43) were more likely to survive than those who did not (39.5 percent vs 14.1 percent; p less than .01), and those who received lidocaine drip were more likely to survive than those who did not (47.6 percent vs 18.2 percent; p less than .01). The best survival rate (57.1 percent) occurred among those who received both norepinephrine and lidocaine (N = 14). Survivors did not differ significantly from nonsurvivors in terms of age, gender, primary diagnosis, location of arrest, or duration of CPR efforts. The results suggest that aggressive resuscitation efforts which include the addition of norepinephrine and lidocaine drips to the AHA-recommended regimen of epinephrine and atropine may substantially increase the number of 24-h survivors. A pharmacologic mechanism involving norepinephrine-induced myocardial irritability and peripheral vasoconstriction, combined with lidocaine-induced suppression of abnormal automaticity, is offered as a possible explanation of the obtained results.\r"

There were eight deaths. Fifty patients had blunt trauma to the chest. These were mostly due to motor vehicle accidents (38 patients), crushing injuries (three patients), and falls (three patients). In addition, there were three patients with trauma to the neck. Physical and radiographic findings included pneumothorax (37 patients), subcutaneous emphysema (31), pulmonary contusion (22), hemothorax (21), mediastinal emphysema (16), flail chest (ten), atelectasis (ten), and hemoptysis (five). The FFB was of diagnostic use in 28 patients (53 percent) by revealing complete tracheal transection (one patient), tracheal laceration (three), complete bronchial transection (one), bronchial laceration (two), bronchial contusion (two), ongoing distal hemorrhage/pulmonary contusion (seven), aspirated material (three), mucous plugging/thick secretions (eight), and supraglottic lesions (three). One of the cases of tracheal laceration was not fully appreciated as a complete transection. We conclude that FFB has value in the short-term evaluation of patients with trauma.\r"

DESIGN: A single-blind prospective study evaluated arterial blood gas, blood pressure, heart rate, and arrhythmia changes during mechanical ventilation and manual transport ventilation. SETTING: University hospital ICUs and various diagnostic or treatment areas. PATIENTS: Twenty mechanically ventilated critically ill patients during intrahospital transport. INTERVENTION: Each patient received mechanical ventilation (MECH) with a volume ventilator while in the ICU and at the study/treatment area. They were manually ventilated (MAN) by a respiratory therapist during transport between areas. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The MECH settings were: VT = 0.75 +/- 0.17 L; f = 16 +/- 4; VE = 12.6 +/- 4.3 L/min; FIO2 = 0.46 +/- 0.2. Mean peak Paw = 31 +/- 12 cm H2O and mean effective Cst = 44 +/- 15 ml/cm H2O. No hemodynamic abnormalities were observed. Arterial blood gas values did not vary to any clinically significant degree, except in two patients: one patient had a reduced PaO2 and increased PaCO2 associated with an accidental O2 disconnection and clamped chest tube; another patient had an increased pH by 0.13 units with only a 9 mm Hg fall in PaCO2. CONCLUSIONS: Manual ventilation during intrahospital transport of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients is safe provided the person performing manual ventilation knows the inspired oxygen fraction and minute ventilation required before transport and is trained to approximate them during transport.\r"

Membrane potential and isometric force were simultaneously measured in isolated canine tracheal muscle using intracellular microelectrodes and a microforce transducer. Azelastine, at 1 microM, depressed the histamine-induced contractile force by more than 60 percent. The histamine-induced membrane depolarization was also inhibited, but to a much less extent, compared to the inhibition of contractile force. Similarly, contraction induced by ACh was inhibited by azelastine. In contrast to histamine, ACh elicited electrical oscillations concomitant with the membrane depolarization. Azelastine abolished these oscillations without affecting the depolarization. Azelastine inhibited the Ca2+-dependent slow action potentials (induced by 20 mM TEA) in a concentration-dependent manner; complete inhibition occurred at 30 microM. Such direct inhibitory effects of azelastine on agonist-induced airway muscle contraction may explain its ability to exert bronchodilatation in asthmatic patients. One of its mechanisms of action may involve inhibition of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ influx across the muscle cell membrane; however, additional actions intracellularly are possible.\r"

It is postulated that this was related to the hydrocholorothiazide component of the drug. Although 12 cases have been reported, the pathophysiology remains obscure. Mitogenic stimulation of the patient's lymphocytes to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen was assessed. Blastogenic responses to Staphylococcus aureus antigen, triamterene, and hydrochlorothiazide were also assessed. No hypersensitivity response could be demonstrated to either triamterene or hydrochlorothiazide. The initially low white blood cell count, associated with hemoconcentration, increased in the first 24 h in the hospital. This observation is consistent with intrapulmonary sequestration of granulocytes causing pulmonary edema.\r"

Acid secretion, both basally and in response to gastrin 17-I, was significantly greater in patients with Barrett's esophagus compared to normal individuals without reflux. Basal gastrin levels and meal-stimulated levels of the hormone were similar among all three groups. Sensitivity to gastrin, expressed as the concentration causing half-maximal acid secretion, was also similar among the study groups. It is speculated that elevated basal acid production in Barrett's esophagus may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder.\r"

During the period from January 1975 to December 1985, a total of 134 patients had endoscopically severe esophagitis and/or Barrett's esophagus. In these patients, 32 (24%) met the macroscopic and histologic criteria for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. A check-up study of these patients was performed in 1987. Adenocarcinoma developed in three patients during the follow-up period of 166.1 patient-years. Dysplasia in the columnar epithelium was found in two of these patients six and 15 months before the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The third patient with adenocarcinoma was detected in endoscopic follow-up in 1987. In addition, the endoscopic examination showed unchanged Barrett's epithelium in all but three patients despite the operative and/or medical treatment 3-12 years (mean 6.7 years) earlier. We conclude that Barrett's esophagus is a potential premalignant condition and careful endoscopic surveillance for dysplasia in the columnar epithelium of the distal esophagus is mandatory in patients with Barrett's esophagus.\r"

Our method was simultaneous esophageal manometry and pH monitoring. We observed a three-component esophageal manometric sequence (EMS). When this sequence recurred over and over, we termed this phenomenon \"cycling.\" We found cycling in 35% of the patients (18/52). Those with cycling had lower basal LES pressures, more acid exposure, and an increased incidence of endoscopic esophagitis. That cycling resulted from repeated reflux events and their esophageal clearance was documented by scintigraphy during simultaneous manometry and pH monitoring (N = 7 patients). Cycling was found on the routine esophageal manometry record of 25% of symptomatic patients (N = 112) with an abnormal 24-hr pH score. In conclusion, cycling represents an esophageal manometric phenomenon due to repetitive reflux events. Its recognition during esophageal manometry may denote a severe reflux diathesis.\r"

Increases in perfusion rate (range 0.3-22 ml/min) increased both alkalinization (3-15 mumol/cm hr) and intraluminal pressure (6-22 mm Hg). Increases in pressure (6-30 mm Hg) at constant perfusion rate (3 ml/min) did not change alkalinization. The effect of perfusion rate on alkalinization was rapid, reversible, and could be repeated several times. It was unaffected by indomethacin (10 mg/kg subcutaneously) or tetrodotoxin (1 mg/ml in perfusate). A limited in vitro study at two flow rates (0.3 and 22 ml/min) showed a similar enhancement of alkalinization. It is concluded that the rate of alkalinization is increased by raising the perfusion rate of the lumen both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism remains to be established but may involve the reduction of a diffusion barrier between the mucosa and luminal bulk fluid. These results may have implications for the movement of other substances across intestinal segments.\r"

Blood flow was measured by hydrogen gas clearance. Indomethacin given intragastrically reduced the blood flow in nonlesion areas and the levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the gastric mucosa and caused mucosal damage in a dose-related way. Indomethacin (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced the blood flow 30 min after administration, and the reduction increased until 90 min. Then the flow plateaued until 240 min. Gastric mucosal damage caused by 20 mg/kg of indomethacin and evaluated by only gross observations, began at 60 min and developed with time until 240 min after administration. 16,16-Dimethyl PGE2 (5 micrograms/kg) did not affect the reduction of blood flow caused by indomethacin during 240 min of measurements, but it significantly inhibited the indomethacin-induced mucosal damage evaluated by gross observations. These results suggest that prevention by 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 of grossly observed gastric mucosal damage caused by indomethacin was not related by preservation of the gastric mucosal blood flow in the areas without lesions.\r"

In this study, we evaluated health-related quality of life of 150 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (63 ulcerative colitis, 87 Crohn's disease). We used a standardized measure, the Sickness Impact Profile, and a questionnaire we developed that elicits and prioritizes the disease-related worries and concerns of patients with IBD. Our preliminary data indicate that: (1) IBD patients experience moderate functional impairment more in the social and psychological than in the physical dimensions; (2) Crohn's disease patients report psychosocial dysfunction to a greater degree than ulcerative colitis patients; (3) IBD patients report greatest concerns about having surgery, degree of energy, and body image issues such as having an ostomy bag; and (4) functional status and patient concerns correlate better with other measures of health status and previous health care utilization than the physician's rating of disease activity. We believe that questionnaires measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can be used in research and patient care to extend the clinical assessment of patients with IBD. Further work is needed to determine the role of HRQOL relative to disease activity and other physician-based assessments in predicting health outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cyclosporin A in acute and chronically active inflammatory bowel disease was tested in 11 patients with Crohn's disease and two with ulcerative colitis who had exhibited a poor response to at least eight weeks of conventional therapy. Trough levels of the drug in the therapeutic range were obtained in 12 of 13 patients. Cyclosporin A, which was usually added to the continued previous medication, including corticosteroids (11 of 13) or metronidazol (1 of 13), prompted an apparent clinical improvement in all but one patient. In six of the nine Crohn's disease patients with an initial Best index of greater than 150, a definite fall by at least 100 points was observed after 2-10 weeks of treatment, but the van Hees index declined only in two patients. All four patients with chronic perineal fistulation experienced symptomatic relief. Both patients with ulcerative colitis had a clinical remission. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or serum albumin improved in eight of 13 patients. However, two of the nine responders with Crohn's disease relapsed during cyclosporin A therapy and three immediately after the medication was discontinued. Common side effects included hypertrichosis, tremor, and hyperesthesia; hypertension and epigastric pain each occurred only in one patient.\r"

Normal values were established in five control calves and seven calves (principals) were inoculated with 1.0 x 10(8) Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. Hydrogen concentrations and wet fecal weights were measured at three stages: before Cryptosporidium sp. inoculation (stage 1), three days after the onset of diarrhea (stage 2), and after the resolution of diarrhea (stage 3). Mean end-breath and total-breath H2 concentrations in the principal calves were higher (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.05) for stage 2, when compared to control values. Both end-breath and total-breath H2 concentrations were increased (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.025, respectively) in the principal calves during stage 2 when compared to values obtained for stages 1 and 3. Concurrently, Cryptosporidium sp. infection was associated with increased (P = 0.06) fecal output during stage 2, only. The increased H2 concentrations and cumulative fecal output show that Cryptosporidium sp. caused malabsorption of fermentable nutrients.\r"

Starting 5 min after a phase 3 of the migrating motor complex, 18 healthy men received 5 or 10 mg cisapride or placebo orally in random double-blind fashion and ingested meals containing 1000 and 4200 kJ, respectively. Jejunal pressures were recorded pneumohydraulically with five catheter orifices 10-30 cm aboard the ligament of Treitz. After the 4200-kJ meal, total number and number of propagated contractions as well as area under the curve increased significantly more than after 1000 kJ. Following the 1000-kJ but not the 4200-kJ meal, 10 mg cisapride increased total number of contractions, number of propagated contractions, mean amplitude, and area under curve significantly more than placebo. Fed-pattern duration increased with the meal's caloric content but was not influenced systematically by cisapride. In conclusion, cisapride stimulates jejunal motor activity and induces a propagative pattern after a 1000-kJ but not after a 4200-kJ meal, suggesting that it can produce no further stimulation when motor activity is near maximally enhanced already.\r"

In this study we investigated the relationship between cholesterol gallstone formation, changes in biliary motility, and rates of gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis in prairie dogs receiving a 0.34% cholesterol diet for two, four, or six weeks. Gallstones did not occur until four weeks, when the incidence was 14%; after six weeks the incidence was 64%. Gallbladder emptying increased slightly at two weeks before becoming significantly decreased at four and six weeks. In contrast, there was a near linear increase in basal cystic duct resistance which began by two weeks of cholesterol feeding, although sphincter of Oddi resistances remained normal throughout the period of study. The synthesis of prostaglandins E and F2 alpha by the gallbladder was also increased beginning at two weeks and rose to a plateau at four and six weeks. In view of the potent effects of prostaglandins on biliary smooth muscle, these findings suggest that prostaglandins may mediate early changes in gallbladder and cystic duct motility which ultimately result in impaired gallbladder emptying.\r"

Recordings of fasting and postprandial myoelectrical activity were performed in three groups of animals in whom the following procedures had been performed: (1) electrode placement alone, intestinal continuity undisturbed (controls); (2) ileocolonic sphincter substitute fashioned in mid-jejunum; and (3) transection and reanastomosis at a similar location in mid-jejunum. Transection alone resulted in a decrease in slow-wave frequency, a shortening of the period of the interdigestive myoelectrical complex (IDMEC) and a prolongation of phase III of the IDMEC in the jejunum distal to the site of transection. The IDMEC period was also shorter at proximal electrode sites, but the incidence of IDMEC phase III complexes was similar on either side of the transection. However, in those animals in whom a sphincter substitute had been fashioned at the site of the transection, the incidence of IDMEC phase III complexes was significantly suppressed in the proximal intestine; IDMEC phase III frequency per hour (mean +/- SD transection vs sphincter substitute) was 0.59 +/- 0.20 vs 0.23 +/- 0.24, P less than 0.002; 0.61 +/- 0.24 vs 0.28 +/- 0.30, P less than 0.006; 0.61 +/- 0.24 vs 0.29 +/- 0.30, P = 0.008, at electrodes 10, 35, and 85 cm proximal to the sphincter substitute, respectively. In addition, the sphincter-substitute animals alone demonstrated, during fasting, recurrent propagated bursts of spike clusters and occasional prolonged spike bursts in electrodes proximal to the sphincter substitute.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the type-A infection anti-pHSA disappears after the acute phase; in the other two forms it persists all along as the infection develops. Specifically in non-A, non-B infection only the IgM type anti-pHSA is produced.\r"

The hemolytic anemia appeared at a mean of 10 years after the onset of colitis, apparently independent of the age of the patient. Although seven of the eight patients had active colitis at the time of diagnosis of anemia, there was no consistent relationship to the extent of the bowel disease. Seven of the eight patients survived. One patient showed a partial response to steroid therapy, two responded to splenectomy, but four required both colectomy and splenectomy. Steroids should be the first line of therapy followed by splenectomy, if necessary. For those patients who have severe colitis, which in itself would merit surgery, a total proctocolectomy combined with splenectomy seems advisable.\r"

ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in mice following i.p., oral, or i.v. administration. The ED50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v. ACC-9653 and 8 mg/kg for i.v. phenytoin sodium. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs. The total doses of ACC-9653 or phenytoin sodium necessary to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg, respectively. Only phenytoin sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig right atria. In anesthetized dogs, a high dose of ACC-9653 (31 mg/kg) was infused over 15, 20, and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of phenytoin sodium (21 mg/kg). The ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force (LVdP/dt). The maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum phenytoin sodium levels. Acute toxicity studies of ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium were carried out in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs by i.v., i.m., and i.p. routes of administration. The systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses.

The intermittent oral or rectal administration of diazepam is especially useful for acute home treatment of recurrent seizures. Phenytoin prodrug (ACC-9653), an investigational new drug, is promptly absorbed after intramuscular injection. Unlike phenytoin, it does not require propylene glycol and high alkalinity for solubility and therefore does not produce soft-tissue injury after parenteral administration.

Myelin vacuolation of the brain was observed. The vacuolation was limited to myelinated tracts and resulted from separation of the myelin sheath at the interperiod line. There was no evidence of demyelination, axonal degeneration, or damage uolation was histologically similar to that observed in association with other drugs such as triethyltin, isoniazid, or hexachlorophene. However, the distribution is limited to the brain and is reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Two postmortem and three operative specimens from humans have revealed no evidence of vacuolation of myelin.\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic action of vigabatrin (gamma vinyl GABA, GVG) has been reported to be mediated by GABAergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we evaluated different neurotransmitter systems in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with complex partial epilepsy, before and during GVG treatment. The markers of the GABAergic system (free GABA, total GABA, homocarnosine) showed a two- to threefold elevation. There was also an increase in glycine during the 6 months of GVG treatment. In contrast, we did not find any constant CSF changes in either excitatory amino acids or in markers of the cholinergic (acetylcholinesterase), dopaminergic (homovanillic acid), serotonergic (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), or peptidergic (somatostatin, prolactin, beta-endorphin) systems. This finding (except an elevation in glycine) was in agreement with previous studies which suggest a specific action of GVG on the GABAergic system. The role of glycine in antiepileptic efficacy of GVG needs further evaluation.\r"

Long-term animal toxicology studies have demonstrated that GVG can induce nonprogressive, reversible intramyelinic edema in central white matter tracts. The response to GVG varies among species, with rodents being the most dramatic and monkeys showing an equivocal effect even at high doses. The response in dogs is marked and measurable. The detection of these subtle findings requires the use of sophisticated technology. Evoked potentials are becoming reliable and sensitive tools in clinical neurology. This study, involving 54 patients for 11 months, was undertaken to assess the effect and safety of GVG in humans with refractory epilepsy. No data from this investigation indicate prolongation of neuronal conduction time in CNS pathways, suggesting that this agent is safe in humans.\r"

After 36 months, the median percentage of baseline seizures was less than 20%. GVG is a very potent antiepileptic drug. It is well tolerated in humans. The side effects are few.

  ".W": "The goal of management in epilepsy is to make patients completely seizure-free without side effects. Currently, this goal can be achieved fully in only about one-half of the 50,000,000 people in the world with epilepsy. Epilepsy is not a benign condition. Uncontrolled epilepsy produces significant morbidity and mortality. Even infrequent seizures put a patient at risk of sudden death and compromise employability and other social functions. The potential risk of a new antiepileptic drug has to be weighted against the potential risk of continuing seizures and the potential for the new drug to control those seizures. Vigabatrin (gamma vinyl GABA, GVG) is one of the promising new antiepileptic drugs now under development. In four large clinical trials half of the patients in each trial had a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in seizure frequency when GVG was added to existing antiepileptic drug. This represents a significant response rate in add-on trials, which are a severe test of a new antiepileptic drug. Although microvacuoles have been seen in the white matter of the brains of rats and dogs treated with GVG, such pathological changes have not yet been observed in humans. Evoked potential studies have failed to reveal any evidence of microvacuolization in humans. Because of the potential efficacy of GVG in controlling previously therapeutic-resistant seizures and of the absence of evidence of significant toxicity in humans, carefully monitored clinical trials of GVG in therapy-resistant patients with epilepsy should continue.\r"

Immunoglobulins were prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sepharose and subjected to isoelectric focusing for separation into 30 fractions. The fractions were tested for their ability to inhibit 125I-labeled insulin binding to human placental membranes, immunoprecipitate solubilized insulin receptor cross-linked with 125I-insulin, and mimic or inhibit the action of insulin in rat adipocytes. The results varied among the three patients. In the first patient, inhibition of 125I-insulin-binding activity (IBA) and insulin-receptor-precipitating activity (IPA) were distributed almost identically, but the distribution of insulinlike bioactivity (ILBA) was somewhat different. In the second patient, some fractions exhibited potent IBA without IPA, and these fractions inhibited the action of insulin in rat adipocytes. In the third patient, all of the isoelectric fractions showed IBA without IPA and were insulin antagonists. These observations indicate that some patients have antibodies with pure insulin-antagonist properties and provide further evidence that autoantibodies to insulin receptors are polyclonal and recognize different antigenic sites on insulin-receptor molecules. The findings also suggest that the ability of antibodies to elicit ILBA is linked to the ability to immunoprecipitate 125I-insulin-cross-linked and solubilized receptors, whereas antibodies that only inhibit insulin binding behave as insulin antagonists.\r"

Abnormal platelet function could contribute to the increased incidence of vascular disease in diabetes mellitus. The biochemical mechanism(s) for platelet hyperactivation is unknown. We examined the hypothesis that platelet phosphoinositide turnover, a key signal-transducing mechanism involved in platelet activation, was abnormal in diabetic subjects. Platelets were harvested from 16 subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 19 healthy, nondiabetic control subjects of comparable age. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TBG), a specific marker of platelet activity in vivo, was increased in IDDM (67.1 +/- 7.3 ng/ml) compared with control (41.0 +/- 6.0 ng/ml) subjects (P less than .005). [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi) incorporation into the individual phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid (PA) reached isotopic equilibrium by 120 min for IDDM and control subjects. Specific activity (dpm 32P/micrograms phosphorus) of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was not different between IDDM and control subjects. Under these conditions, basal 32Pi incorporation into PIP2 and PIP but not phosphatidylinositol (PI) or PA was significantly lower in IDDM subjects. There was significantly decreased [32P]PIP2 and [32P]PIP hydrolysis and decreased [32P]PA formation in IDDM after platelet stimulation with 4 U/ml human thrombin. There were no differences in [32P]PI hydrolysis between the two groups. The mass of PIP2 was reduced (P less than .005) in the platelets from IDDM (0.71 +/- 0.23 nmol/10(9) platelets) compared with control (1.65 +/- 0.53 nmol/10(9) platelets) subjects. Similarly, PIP was lower (P less than .001) in IDDM (0.66 +/- 0.09 nmol/10(9) platelets) than in control (2.92 +/- 0.43 nmol/10(9) platelets) subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within each diabetic group, subjects were selected for normal kidney function (urinary albumin excretion less than 40 mg/24 h, normal blood pressure, creatinine clearance greater than 90 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) or for nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion greater than 200 mg/24 h). Morphometric analysis of glomeruli revealed a significantly larger mean glomerular volume in subjects with nephropathy (group 2). Mesangial volumes were significantly greater in the nephropathic than the normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects in each group, but filtration surface per glomerulus was constant among all subjects. The percentage of sclerosed glomeruli was also significantly increased in the nephropathic subjects compared with the subjects with normal kidney function, in whom sclerosed glomeruli did not exceed 8%. In addition, there was a significant correlation between percentage of globally sclerosed glomeruli and glomerular volume in group 2 (rs = .79, P less than .01) but not group 1 (rs = -.20, NS) subjects. Thus, glomerular size or individual capacity for glomerular expansion may determine the rate of progression of the loss of kidney function in subjects destined to develop diabetic nephropathy.\r"

The ability of three serotonin-uptake blockers to reverse the performance deficit in learning induced by previous uncontrollable stress (learned-helplessness paradigm) was investigated in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Three weeks after induction of diabetes, rats were subjected to a session of 60 inescapable electric foot shocks and, after 48 h, to three daily sessions of two-way shuttle-box training. Three serotonin-uptake blockers were given intraperitoneally over 5 consecutive days. As with nondiabetic rats, citalopram (1 mg.kg-1. day-1), fluoxetine (2 and 4 mg.kg-1. day-1), and fluvoxamine (4 mg.kg-1.day-1) reduced the number of escape failures in diabetic rats. From these data, we suggest that it is unlikely that the impaired response of diabetic rats to tricyclic antidepressants is caused by serotonergic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoglycemia causes substantial morbidity and some mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is often the limiting factor in attempts to achieve euglycemia. The prevention or correction of hypoglycemia normally involves both dissipation of insulin and activation of glucose counterregulatory systems. Among the latter, glucagon plays a primary role initially, whereas epinephrine is not critical, although it becomes critical when glucagon is deficient. Growth hormone and cortisol play demonstrable roles in recovery from prolonged hypoglycemia. Glucose autoregulation may be involved in defense against severe hypoglycemia. With respect to pathophysiology, counterregulatory systems are involved in at least five clinical glucoregulatory syndromes. Defective glucose counterregulation is associated with, and best attributed to, combined deficiencies of the glucagon and epinephrine responses to plasma glucose decrements. Almost assuredly in concert with hypoglycemia unawareness, it results in a markedly increased frequency of severe hypoglycemia, at least during intensive therapy of IDDM. Defined as a night to morning increase in plasma glucose concentration, the dawn phenomenon is thought to result from dissipation of insulin plus the effects of nocturnal growth hormone secretion. Despite a sound rationale, the clinical relevance of the Somogyi phenomenon has been recently questioned. The clinical impression of altered glycemic thresholds for symptoms, i.e., patients with poorly controlled IDDM suffer symptoms of hypoglycemia at relatively high plasma glucose levels, whereas those with very well-controlled IDDM often tolerate subnormal glucose levels, has received experimental support. Clearly, hypoglycemia in IDDM is a problem that needs to be solved. Numerous issues need to be addressed through both basic and clinical research.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the surgical patients, complications, length of stay, and intensive care stay were all significantly greater than for patients treated by endoscopic laser. Mean total cost for surgery was $23,156 compared with $5333 for inpatient laser treatment (p less than 0.001) and $2263 for outpatient laser treatment (p less than 0.001). Lifetime cost calculated in patients with metastases treated by surgery was $22,900 compared with $12,154 for laser therapy (p less than 0.05). Mean survival in patients with metastases was 28 weeks in the surgery group and 36 weeks for laser treatment.

Results of biopsies were confirmed by surgery or the disease course in each of the 12 patients. Only one stone could not be fragmented and removed because the EHL probe could not be properly placed. The diagnosis of biliary stenosis may be markedly enhanced by using a UTE although at the risk of an endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent biliary infection.

Didactic teaching methods included 5 hours of videotapes, slides, endoscopic models, and the use of a photo atlas. Following a patient demonstration, each trainee completed 25 examinations supervised with a teaching attachment. Criteria used to assess trainee competence included unassisted length of scope insertion and examination duration. Mean depth of scope insertion was 35.9 cm for the first five examinations, increasing to a mean of 51.7 cm for the final five examinations. Average examination duration decreased from 19.1 min for examinations 1 through 5 to 17.0 min for examinations 21 through 25. Out of 1236 examinations, one or more polyps were found in 222 patients (18.0%). Carcinoma was found in 15 of 1236 examinations (1.4%). In summary, experienced endoscopists can teach primary care physicians to perform 60-cm FFS.

  ".W": "Use of small diameter, extraflexible pediatric colonoscopes has proved to be valuable in adult endoscopy practice, not only for passing strictures and stomas but also where either fixation due to diverticular disease or postoperative adhesions, or unavoidably painful looping made passage of adult colonoscopes impossible. In 70 of 78 (92%) of the cases where the adult colonoscope could not be passed through the sigmoid colon by an expert endoscopist, the pediatric colonoscope passed through, often very easily. Fifteen of these patients were considered to have been saved surgery by successful passage. The \"failure\" rate for all colonoscopy examinations was only 2%; this low failure rate was attributable to the use of pediatric instruments whenever passage through the sigmoid colon proved to be impossible with standard colonoscopes. In our opinion every unit performing frequent colonoscopies should have a pediatric colonoscope available for selected adult patients as well as for use in children.\r"

We prospectively evaluated 1600 patients undergoing colonoscopy at Virginia Mason Medical Center from December 1, 1986 to November 31, 1987. Thirty-one procedures (1.9%) failed to reach the splenic flexure because of functional or anatomic stenoses. Attempt at pancolonoscopy with a 9.8-mm diameter, 102-cm length endoscope (Olympus XQ) was successful to the right colon in 73% and cecum in 60% of these patients. Two thirds of the successfully intubated patients had clarification of radiographic abnormalities or delineation of additional colon pathology. There were no complications or instrument damages, but limitations included short scope length and small suction channel. We conclude that small diameter upper endoscopes can be used safely and effectively for colonoscopy in a subset of patients in whom conventional colonoscopy is unsuccessful.\r"

The majority of American elders who commit suicide use a firearm to do so. Most suicidal elders look to their primary care physician for help, although they may not directly express their plan. Therefore, physicians must be alert to clues. By far the principal risk factor for suicide is major depression. The risk is heightened by recent losses, alcohol or drug abuse, psychosis, cognitive decline, and chronic disease. Hopelessness, anhedonia, self-reproach, guilt, and a formed lethal plan are signs of a life-threatening suicidal crisis which requires urgent intervention. Physicians must act decisively in recognition of the fact that suicidality is a transient, treatable condition.\r"

The evaluation of gastrointestinal ailments is difficult in the aged due to variation in signs and symptoms, coexisting nutritional problems, lack of patient cooperation, presence of comorbidity, and effects of polypharmacy. Poor clinical histories are common and gastrointestinal ailments may be atypical. Non-compliance with therapy and testing is a common problem and unrealistic expectations from interventions are the rule rather than the exception. Iatrogenic disorders must be ruled out in all patients with gastrointestinal symptoms; an accurate drug and nutritional history is critical for achieving success in the management of the elderly.\r"

While candidiasis was the most common cause of symptoms (26 patients), discrete ulceration of the oesophagus occurred in 12 instances in 10 patients (four cytomegalovirus, four herpes simplex virus, three aphthous ulcer, one peptic ulcer). One patient had a diffuse oesophagitis caused by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. No cause was found for the oesophageal symptoms in four patients. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was found in seven patients associated with other pathology in four. All 26 patients with oesophageal candidiasis only, also had oral involvement. All the patients with herpes simplex virus (four) and aphthous ulcers (three) had obvious perioral involvement. Three of the four patients with cytomegalovirus ulceration had evidence of disease elsewhere (colon or retina). All patients with Kaposi's sarcoma lesions had skin and buccal cavity involvement. The cause of oesophageal disease was usually obvious at endoscopy. The appearance of candidiasis was typical and the various ulcerating lesions also had different macroscopic configurations. Cytomegalovirus infection produced deep linear ulcers in the distal oesophagus, herpes simplex oesophagitis is similar in appearance to the typical perioral lesions of fluid filled vesicles. Diagnostic radiology was not helpful in most patients. In nine of 17 patients with candidiasis, the barium swallow examination performed within 24 hours of presentation was normal. In only three of seven patients with oesophageal ulceration (three cytomegalovirus, two herpes simplex virus, one aphthous, one peptic) was there evidence of an abnormality. Treatment produces symptomatic relief.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Opinions differ, however, about the methods to review the extensive motility data and the definition of abnormal motility changes. We studied 30 patients (18 women, age 46 years) with suspected oesophageal chest pain using a portable recording system attached to a 4.5 mm catheter with pressure transducers 3 and 8 cm and pH probe 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). An event marker was triggered by the patient for chest pain. In the patient's diary, pain was recorded on a scale of increasing severity 1-10. Two methods of analysis were used to assess 24 hour motility data. The 24 hour technique sampled five minute asymptomatic baselines throughout the study to define the patient's normal range of oesophageal motility. The second technique used only the 10 minute period immediately before each chest pain episode as the asymptomatic baseline. Chest pain episodes were defined as abnormal if associated with pH less than 4 or motility changes not present during the asymptomatic baseline analysis: 135 chest pain episodes were recorded. The method of motility analysis significantly (p less than 0.01) changed the number of chest pain episodes associated with abnormal motility: 24 hour technique - 14 episodes (10%) versus a 2.5-fold increase with the 10 minute baseline technique - 33 episodes (24%). Acid related pain episodes were similar in both groups - 13%. The majority of chest pain episodes had no association with abnormal motility or acid reflux. Increasing chest pain severity was inversely correlated with the presence of abnormal oesophageal events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although this procedure carries a low incidence of early postoperative complications there is little information on either longer term follow up or the impact on nutritional status. The present study describes the outcome in 42 patients with morbid obesity who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty and were followed up in a special nutrition clinic between nine and 36 months postoperatively. Body mass index (BMI) fell from a preoperative value of 47.4 (6.7) kg/m2 (mean (SD] to 37.5 (5.8), 35 (6.2), 33.9 (6.1), and 33.1 (5.7) kg/m2 at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months respectively. Immediate postoperative complications were minimal but during follow up four patients developed stenosis of the gastroplasty stoma and required reoperation. Plasma albumen concentrations were maintained but three patients developed iron deficiency anaemia. Most patients were able to eat a normal diet in reduced quantities and noted a marked improvement in the quality of life. The benefits and safety of vertical banded gastroplasty suggest an important role for this operation in the management of morbid obesity.\r"

The knowledge that a balloon is present may influence the patients' eating patterns and reduce caloric intake and weight. In order to test whether the balloon or the secondary psychological effect caused weight loss, a double blind balloon versus sham procedure was devised with both groups receiving identical outpatient dietary advice (800 kcal/day). Twenty four obese women with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 from an obesity clinic were studied. Twelve had the balloon and 12 the sham procedure. The balloon was removed after three months and the patients were followed for a further three months. There was significantly greater weight loss in the balloon group, mean weight loss (SD) of 7.33 (6.12) kg compared with the sham group, mean weight loss (SD) of 3.33 (3.9) kg (p less than 0.05). Weight loss was not maintained in all patients after balloon removal. Side effects were more common in the balloon group (abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting) but resolved by the second week. We conclude that the intragastric balloon is a safe and effective method of inducing weight loss in well motivated obese patients.\r"

The presence of C pylori was detected in gastric mucosal biopsy specimens by the biopsy urease test, microscopy (Gram stained smears and histology) and culture. Two media were used for the biopsy urease test: Christensen's urea broth (for the first 600 patients) and the Christensen's urea broth modified by increasing the concentration of phenol red and omitting the nutrients, glucose and peptone (for the remaining patients). Both the Christensen's urea broth and modified urea broth were almost 100% specific when compared with detection of C pylori by Gram, culture and histopathology. The modified broth was more sensitive (96% sensitivity compared with culture) than the Christensen's broth (92% sensitivity) but this difference was not statistically significant. The modified broth gave significantly more positive results (58%) in less than 30 minutes than the Christensen's broth (48%). Seventy four per cent of positive results were available in less than two hours. Specimens from patients with extensive C pylori infection gave more rapid results: 86% of specimens that yielded a profuse growth of C pylori and 76% that contained numerous organisms on histological sections had a positive urease test in less than one hour. There was no significant difference between the specificity and sensitivity of our modified urea broth and the other modified broths described in the literature. This test is a cheap and rapid alternative to the diagnosis of C pylori by Gram stained smears or culture.\r"

With early dinner nocturnal pH was higher, than with late dinner (pH median: 1.67 and 1.39, p less than 0.001). During the remaining time periods, pH values were similar.

Chronic atrophic gastritis patients and patients with Billroth I or II gastric resections showed median concentrations of 2 ppm NO-2 which increased to 20 ppm (up to 200 ppm in one Billroth II patient) after administration of nitrate. Endogenous formation of N-nitrosoproline using the NPRO-test was determined in two groups with low (healthy control and proximal gastral vagotomy patients) and high (Billroth I and II patients) gastric nitrite concentrations. After 12 h fasting, 200 mg nitrate was orally administered, followed 30 min later by 500 mg L-proline. Endogenously formed N-nitrosoproline which is quantitatively excreted in urine was determined in urine over the following 24 hours. In over 80% of the urine samples collected from Billroth I and II patients no detectable NPRO was found whilst in over 85% of the healthy controls and proximal gastral vagotomy patients up to 33.5 micrograms NPRO was detected.

Most variables showed no significant difference between the organic and the functional group. The most important variables with predictive value were psychological factors, factors associated with the severity and factors associated with the duration of the complaints.\r"

We have evaluated 48 'normal' subjects over the age of 65 years and compared the results with those of 46 normal subjects under 65 from a previous study. Results were calculated as eight hour cumulative values and expressed as percentages of the administered dose. Reference ranges have been calculated separately for the following age groups: 65 years or less (201 to 460), 66 to 75 (182 to 405) and over 75 (141 to 336). A clear age related decline in eight hour cumulative values was noted. The values fell by 23% between the ages of 17 and 65 years and by 25% between the ages of 65 and 87 years. Pancreatic insufficiency or bacterial colonisation of the small bowel is unlikely, but delayed intestinal absorption or the effects of slower metabolic rate cannot be excluded. This test is simple and practicable in the elderly and the study emphasises the importance of age in the interpretation of results.\r"

In the excluded colorectum, the total bacterial count was only slightly lower than controls but the variety of the flora was significantly reduced. This reduction was confined to strict anaerobes, mainly the genus Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium. Among aerobes, enterobacteria were more often isolated than in controls. This altered microflora of excluded colorectum could be involved in the mucosal damage observed in some cases.\r"

A rise in the gastric pH above 4.0 for more than six hours between 1800 h and 0600 h was considered as sufficient effect (response) of the H2-receptor antagonists on gastric acidity. Among the patients with cirrhosis, there were significantly (p less than 0.005) more non-responders to ranitidine (16 of 27 patients) than in the control group (six of 32). When 13 of the 22 non-responders to ranitidine were subsequently treated with famotidine, only two showed a sufficient rise in their gastric pH. Of the 11 patients not responding to both H2-receptor antagonists, 10 were finally treated with cimetidine and eight did not respond. Plasma levels of all three drugs measured two and four hours after oral administration were not significantly different between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients as well as between responders and non-responders. In addition, in all patients plasma levels were far above the corresponding IC50 values. Therefore, differences in the absorption and plasma levels of these drugs cannot account for the frequent non-response in cirrhotics.\r"

The study was carried out in nine patients in whom the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis was established according to accepted criteria. After one year of UDCA therapy liver function tests significantly improved. Total serum bile acid concentration did not change significantly (29.2 (31.5) v 28.3 (26.4) microM). Total UDCA (1.7 (2.2) v 13.3 (14.5) microM) and glyco UDCA (0.8 (1.6) v 10.9 (11.4 microM) but not tauro UDCA levels increased significantly (p less than 0.01); UDCA (7.7 (12.6) v 40.2 (12.7)%) became the major species of the circulating bile acids. Primary bile acids (23 (28.3) v 11.2 (10.5) and their glycoconjugates fell significantly (p less than 0.01). There were no significant changes in the concentrations of conjugates of the secondary bile acids (4.5 (3.8) v 3.9 (3.0]. Our study shows that oral administration of UDCA to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis induced marked changes in the circulating pool of endogenous bile acids together with improvement in liver function test values. The data also suggest that the beneficial effect of longterm administration of UDCA in these patients might be mediated through changes in the circulating primary bile acids and UDCA rather than through changes in the circulating secondary bile acids, deoxycholate and lithocholate.\r"

The temporal relationship and magnitude of the IgM anti-HBc response is variable suggesting that the antibody is not directly involved in hepatocyte lysis, but is merely a marker of a changed state of immunity to the nucleocapsid proteins, induced by interferon. IgG 1, 2, 3, and 4 class anti-HBc did not change during therapy, but IgG 3 anti-HBc was significantly lower in responders than non-responders. IgG anti-HBc of all subclasses was absent in two Chinese HBV carriers. Lower than normal titres of anti-HBc (p less than 0.001) were detected in human immunodeficiency virus antibody positive (anti-HIV) HBV carriers. These data indicate the presence of altered immunity to the nucleocapsid antigens in these two types of chronic HBV carrier that are known to respond poorly to antiviral therapy.\r"

The patients have been followed on average for 32 months (range six to 72 months). Eighteen patients have subsequently required cholecystectomy (9.6%), with six major complications, but no deaths. There have been 27 natural deaths and 156 patients remain alive and symptom free.

This study was designed to determine the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in gall bladder contractions using a highly selective and potent CCK-receptor antagonist, CR-1505 (loxiglumide) in healthy men either infused with exogenous CCK in graded doses (1.56-50 pmol/kg/h) or subjected to modified sham feeding (MSF) and ordinary feeding tests. The gall bladder volume measured by real time ultrasonography showed dose dependent decrease in the gall bladder volume in 10 subjects when CCK8 was infused iv in graded doses reaching about 15% at 1.56 pmol/kg/h and 91% at 50 pmol/kg/h. Close correlation between the decrease in gall bladder volume and the dosage of CCK or the increments in plasma CCK-bioactivity was observed. After pretreatment with loxiglumide, CCK resulted in similar increments in plasma CCK-bioactivity but failed to affect the gall bladder volume at CCK doses up to 6.25 pmol/kg/h and caused only 53% reduction at 50 pmol/kg/h. Modified sham feeding and real feeding reduced the volume of gall bladder by 20% and 70%, respectively and loxiglumide decreased these values to 15% and 30%, respectively. This study provides evidence that loxiglumide is highly potent and selective CCK antagonist and that endogenous CCK plays an important role both in the postprandial contractions of gall bladder.\r"

Ten male volunteers were intubated with a 4-lumen jejunal tube to collect gastric and duodenal secretions separately via the first and third tube, to infuse PEG 4000 distal the pylorus via the second tube and to apply porcine pancreatic extracts via the fourth tube distal the ligament of Treitz. Pancreatic extracts were given four times at 40 minute intervals; the first two as active enzymes and subsequently as heat denatured proportions. Secretin was continuously infused intravenously (0.5 E/kg bw/h) to achieve minimal pancreatic flow. Lipase, amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, volume, and bicarbonate were measured in duodenal contents in eight pooled 15 minute fractions. Three subjects who received HEPES-Ringer buffer instead of pancreatic enzymes served as controls. Plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) was measured using a sensitive bioassay. Both active and heat denatured pancreatic extracts caused a small but significant increase in amylase and chymotrypsin secretion. Basal plasma CCK values were 0.85 (0.05) pM. After intrajejunal instillation of either active or heat denatured pancreatic extracts plasma CCK rose to 3.25 (0.30) pM and to 3.28 (0.36) pM respectively. In a second group of five volunteers, plasma CCK concentrations were measured after a test meal. On day 1, volunteers received a liquid fat and protein rich meal and on day 2, the same test meal containing porcine pancreatic extracts. In both cases, a similar increase in plasma CCK was observed. We conclude that therapy with pancreatic extracts stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion. This may be mediated through release of CCK.\r"
