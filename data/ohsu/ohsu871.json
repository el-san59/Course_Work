  ".W": "Primary malignant melanoma of the adrenal gland is an established entity despite early doubts. It originates in the adrenal medulla from cells derivative of the neural crest. Because of the high frequency of metastatic involvement of the adrenal by cutaneous and ocular melanomas, rigid diagnostic criteria should be followed. Only four cases of this lesion have been reported since 1946. Review of these four together with the two described in this article shows that primary adrenal melanoma is a highly malignant tumor of middle age that often manifests as a painful flank mass. Distant lymph node metastases can be seen as a presenting sign. Treatment is not effective with a mortality rate approaching 100 per cent within two years. Since the true melanocytic origin of primary adrenal melanoma has not been established and because of the similarity of its pathologic findings with the pheochromocytomas, we believe that adrenal melanoma arises from the pheochromocytes and should be called \"melanotic malignant pheochromocytoma.\"\r"

Pseudoaneurysms of the tibial vessels comprise only three to seven per cent of all pseudoaneurysms and only seven cases of anterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysms have been reported in the American and British literature since World War II. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for prompt detection of these lesions. Formerly, injuries of the tibial vessels were managed by nonoperative measures or exploration and arterial ligation. These approaches were met with varying results. The evolution of current vascular surgical techniques allows successful reconstruction of these vessels. We wish to report a successful method of repair of symptomatic pseudoaneurysm of the anterior tibial artery using a saphenous vein interposition graft. This technique restored arterial continuity and allowed maximal opportunity for limb salvage. Additional management techniques are discussed and compared in order to improve rapid diagnosis and provide efficient treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Local resection of an ampullary tumor with reimplantation of the pancreatic and bile ducts was first described by William S. Halsted in 1899. Technical hazard and unsuitability in malignant ampullary tumors have unfortunately led to a disregard for this operation that is unwarranted. Radical pancreaticoduodenectomy is now the most common method of resecting benign and malignant ampullary tumors. Experience was gained with two high-risk patients with benign adenomatous polyps obstructing the ampulla of Vater. Their medical unsuitability for radical pancreaticoduodenectomy led us to revive the procedure of wide local excision of these tumors with reimplantation of the pancreatic and bile ducts. Operative time and blood loss were substantially less than radical resection and postoperative recoveries were relatively uncomplicated. Radical resection of benign ampullary tumors may be appropriate for good-risk patients in whom the risk of local recurrence outweighs the operative risk. We suggest that local resection of benign ampullary tumors is the procedure of choice in high-risk patients and that it be considered in palliation of limited local malignancies of the ampulla in high-risk patients.\r"

In general, right thoracotomy was applied to patients with secundum ASD two years or older and without associated lesions, while median sternotomy was applied to patients with ostium primum lesions and/or associated lesions. Patients or their families perceived the cosmetic results superior to the right thoracotomy approach over the median sternotomy. We feel that a right thoracotomy and aortic cannulation is effective in females (2 years and older) with secundum ASD for a superior cosmetic result over median sternotomy. However, females with ostium primum and/or associated lesions should undergo median sternotomy for better cardiac access and safety.\r"

This situation has led to the development of a new technique which has been successful in four patients and consists of percutaneous cholecystostomy, direct stone visualization, and fragmentation of gallstones with a percutaneous lithotripter. All patients had a functioning gallbladder, stone diameter less than 30 mm, and abdominal pain secondary to cholelithiasis. The procedure was performed in a two day hospitalization. Initially, under general anesthesia, the gallbladder was intubated with a 21 gauge needle and guidewire and the tract dilated to #30 French. A nephroscope was advanced into the gallbladder through a rigid sheath. All gallstones were visualized, fragmented with a percutaneous lithotripter, and extracted. After a postoperative cholecystocholangiogram, an self-retaining catheter was placed in the gallbladder for an average of 2.5 days. Three of the four patients were discharged from the hospital in two days without any complications. A fourth patient had a small bile leak treated with antibiotics. After an average of 13 months follow-up, all patients had a normal ultrasound or oral cholecystogram and no biliary tract symptoms. This technique is safe and efficient in removing gallstones and has no recurrence of gallstones in the 13 month follow-up period.\r"

  ".W": "Choledochoscopy is an accepted technique in the operative exploration of the common bile duct, and is complimentary to operative cholangiography. Retrograde cholangiography can be achieved perorally in up to 97 per cent of patients and it is reasonable to assume that the use of complimentary cholangioscopy in such patients would help to improve the accuracy of bile duct examination just as it does when applied in the operative setting. We have had the opportunity to use a new technology in the endoscopic evaluation of the common bile duct. An endoscopic retrograde cholangioscopy (ERCP) is first performed and ductal anatomy outlined. When indicated, an endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed. If large stones are present they are removed with a balloon or basket. The standard side-viewing endoscope is then removed and replaced with the large channel, side-viewing scope. A \"baby\" scope is introduced through the \"mother\" scope and canulation of the common duct with the \"baby\" scope is performed. Biopsies and brushings of lesions may be obtained and numerous instruments are available for manipulation through the biopsy channel of the \"baby\" scope. The use of retrograde cholangioscopy as an adjunct to retrograde cholangiography should provide the same advantages that have been demonstrated with the use of operative choledochoscopy. Use of this instrument will allow the endoscopist to accurately identify questionable lesions seen on the cholangiogram, selectively canulate particular biliary radicals, biopsy lesions of the common duct, and perhaps intervene therapeutically in selected biliary tract lesions.\r"

Fourteen women were treated after sustaining traumatic injuries. Ten patients were managed without operation and 15 required surgical intervention as part of their treatment. Diagnostic studies that proved helpful included diagnostic peritoneal lavage, ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, and roentgenograms of the chest and abdomen. There were no maternal deaths, but two fetal deaths occurred as a result of traumatic injuries. Five women and one neonate developed major complications requiring prolonged hospitalization.

Septic complications occurred in 11.4 per cent of patients receiving oral antibiotics only, in 11.7 per cent of patients receiving intravenous cefoxitin alone, and in 7.8 per cent of patients receiving both oral and intravenous antibiotics. These differences were not statistically different. The greatest number of septic complications occurred in those patients with anastomotic disruptions. Two patients died (1.3%), both of whom had major anastomotic failures. There was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%).

The mean age was 61 years (range, 15-89); 63 per cent were more than 60 years of age and 44 per cent were more than 70 years of age. One third of patients had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease. Thirty-nine patients (44%) were taking ulcerogenic drugs (28 were using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 6 were using steroids alone, and 5 were using both). Twenty-eight patients (32%) were taking antacid/H2-blockers, including 15 patients with history of ulcer disease and 11 patients taking ulcerogenic drugs. Concurrent systemic diseases were present in 63 per cent of patients; 12 patients were hospitalized for other illnesses at the time of perforation. Abdominal pain was the chief complaint in 83 patients (94%) and 52 patients (59%) had peritonitis. Leukocytosis was present in 49 patients (56%). Pneumoperitoneum was noted in 65 per cent. The duodenal bulb was the site of perforation in 62 per cent, the pyloric region in 20 per cent, and the gastric body in 18 per cent. A definitive ulcer procedure (V + P, V + A) was performed in 32 patients (38%); 51 patients (58%) had plication, and the remaining five patients did not undergo surgery. A delay in diagnosis and therapy of less than 24 hours occurred in 20 (23%) patients. Mortality was 24 per cent, and correlated significantly with age more than 60 years, but not with treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The structures of the two acidic lipids have been elucidated as a new class of glycosphingolipids, termed sulfoglucuronyl glycolipids (SGGLs). SGGLs have been demonstrated to be present in myelin, axolemma, and other glia-related membranes in PNS of several animal species, as well as in human dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia. In rabbits sensitized with sulfoglucuronyl paragloboside (SGPG), a major SGGL in PNS, antibodies developed with reactivities toward SGPG and MAG. The animals also showed moderate weakness, a slowed nerve conduction velocity, and evidence of conduction block. Recently we also found SGPG in rat brain microvessels. This finding supports our hypothesis that autoantibodies may first interact with endothelial cell-bound antigens and that this might change the permeability of the blood-brain or blood-nerve barrier to permit the entry of these autoantibodies into the nervous system. Our data are consistent with the concept that an autoimmune response against the sulfoglucuronyl residue may participate in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated neuropathy.\r"

The antibodies were directed against ganglioside 3'-LM1, shown to be the major ganglioside of peripheral nerve (femoral nerve and cauda equina) in most of the positive GBS sera but also in a high proportion in the controls. No correlation was found between the severity or the course of the disease and the antibody titer. Daily parenteral administration of purified bovine brain-derived GM1 ganglioside for three months to 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not result in any antiganglioside GM1 antibodies. We have interpreted our findings in the following way. Human sera normally contain naturally occurring antibodies against gangliosides that in general do not cause any tissue damage. Thus, parenteral injection of gangliosides will not lead to any antibody formation.\r"

The antibodies might exert their effects at a number of sites, depending on the topographical distribution of the target antigens and on their accessibility. B-cells that express anti-GM1 antibodies are present at birth and are normally suppressed or rendered anergic.

Kinetics of these antibodies can be correlated with the changing clinical course; the appearance of activation products of the terminal complement cascade in cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and peripheral nerve of patients with GBS; and the ability of GBS serum to mediate complement-dependent demyelination of myelinating cultures of rodent dorsal root ganglion. Some of the anti-PNM Ab in all GBS serum tested thus far bind a neutral glycolipid of human PNM and cross react with Forssman antigen, a cross-species antigen found in many infectious agents. Studies suggest that an IgM antibody in GBS patients that could be triggered by multiple infectious agents binds a surface determinant of a Forssman-like lipid of human PNM and participates in demyelination of peripheral nerve through the activation of complement.\r"

Ann Neurol 1988;23:440-447) demonstrating the presence of high levels of antiganglioside ganglioside antibodies in the sera of 5 of 26 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) but not in control sera is summarized. The ganglioside antigens varied among the 5 patients with positive findings, and the antiganglioside antibodies decreased concurrently with clinical improvement in those patients for whom longitudinal samples were available for analysis. The results are discussed in the context of antibodies to acidic glycolipids in other types of neuropathy and other studies on antiglycolipid antibodies in GBS. Data showing the occurrence of lower levels of antibodies to P2 protein, P0 glycoprotein, and myelin-associated glycoprotein in some of the GBS patients are also summarized. The findings from our laboratory combined with the results of others make it unlikely that antiganglioside antibodies have a notable pathogenic effect in most patients with GBS, but the possibility remains that they are of pathogenic importance in some patients with the highest antibody titers.\r"

A recent workshop, in which twelve laboratories received a coded panel of sera containing anti-GM1 antibodies, demonstrated that the immunoassays varied widely in sensitivity and in criteria employed for a positive test. The fine specificity of anti-GSL antibodies should be characterized by analyzing their reactivity with a panel of GSLs with related structures. High-titer monoclonal IgM antibodies against gangliosides and sulfated carbohydrates appear to cause neuropathy in some patients. Low-titer polyclonal antibodies against gangliosides occur frequently in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases without neurological symptoms. It is unclear whether these polyclonal antibodies are a primary manifestation or a consequence of the disease, and their clinical importance is uncertain at present.\r"

In EAN the decisive role of T-lymphocytes in the initiation of immune-mediated nerve damage has been firmly established by adoptive transfer experiments. Macrophages but not Schwann cells express major histocompatibility complex class II gene products in situ and hence may function as antigen presenters. Macrophages are crucial in the amplification and effector phase and damage the myelin sheath by phagocytic attack and release of inflammatory mediators such as toxic oxygen radicals, arachidonic acid metabolites, complement, or hydrolases. Macrophage activation in EAN is achieved by interferon-gamma. Attempts to detect specific sensitization of T-lymphocytes to nerve antigens in patients with GBS have so far been unsuccessful. However, circulating activated T cells can be found in patients with GBS, as evidenced by augmented expression of HLA-DR antigen, the transferrin receptor, and the interleukin-2 receptor on the surface of peripheral blood T cells, and by increased serum concentrations of interleukin-2 and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor. In addition, we present data indicating macrophage activation in GBS.\r"

To provide a different means of evaluating macrophage behavior, we used immunostaining of teased nerve fibers and endoneurial blood vessels. We assessed the frequency with which macrophages were seen in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, their relationship to normal and demyelinating fibers, and their expression of major histocompatibility Class II markers (Ia antigen). In 6 patients with chronic inflammatory neuropathy and 1 with Guillain-Barre syndrome, we found regularly that macrophages were adherent to teased blood vessels. Cells presumed to be entering the nerve were elongated, often with a polarized appearance suggesting motility, and were Ia-positive. After entry into nerve, the Ia-positive macrophages were adherent to both normal and demyelinating fibers. They often retained their Ia positivity after penetrating into the nerve fiber and removing myelin. Foamy macrophages, judged to be postphagocytic, were Ia-negative. The foamy macrophages found adhering to blood vessels were presumed to be leaving the nerve. This pattern of entry as Ia-positive prephagocytic cells and evolution to Ia-negative foamy macrophages was compared with other experimental and human neuropathies.\r"

The reported incidence is influenced by the diagnostic criteria adopted as well as the thoroughness of case-finding. Variations in these account for some of the lack of uniformity between different studies. Data from the Mayo Clinic based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke diagnostic criteria and thorough ascertainment methods gave a crude incidence of 1.7 per 100,000 per year (x 10(-5]. Incidence was higher in females (2.3 x 10(-5] than males (1.2 x 10(-5] as well as in older compared to younger people (3.2 x 10(-5) over age 60 and 0.8 x 10(-5) under age 18, respectively). The disease reached a nadir after onset at 8 days on average, and the illness lasted an average of 12 weeks. Most patients (75%) recovered completely. Recent epidemiological studies of GBS suggest no clear secular trend. Incidence does fluctuate with time but not clearly with season. In virtually all studies \"triggering\" factors are implicated, but they appear to be diverse, making it less likely, from an epidemiological perspective, that a single antigen is of etiological importance in GBS.\r"

In the central nervous system, our studies have documented both active and passive mechanisms of edema formation and support the conclusion that cytokines may be involved in altered blood-brain barrier permeability and inflammation. We conclude that several mechanisms of barrier breakdown are activated in the inflammatory demyelinating diseases and that alteration in endothelial cell function is a major component of disease induction.\r"

Our current understanding of this disease has advanced little beyond Fitz's early description. While survival from pancreatitis has improved largely through advancements in critical care techniques, no medical or surgical therapy exists that can limit pancreatic autodigestion and inflammation. Recent investigations have suggested that pancreatitis may result from a disruption of normal stimulus-secretion coupling within the acinar cell. Future research based on these observations may ultimately result in successful therapy for this disease.\r"

Cancer is emerging as a disease in which individual molecules are either overproduced, mutated, expressed at inappropriate stages of development, or lost due to inheritance or aberrant mitotic division. The major players in this contest of cellular control are growth factors, growth factor receptors (GFRs), signal transducers, and dominant or suppressor/recessive oncogenes. The tumors most frequently removed by surgeons have been reported to have changes in one or another of these types of molecules. The concept of multistage carcinogenesis, whereby malignancy arises after a sequence of changes that are cumulative, and passed from progenitor to daughter cells, is also being defined as a sequence of molecular, genetic, and chromosomal alterations. Molecular antineoplastic therapy is in early stages of development at the laboratory bench. The future may see patients screened for cancer susceptibility, evaluated for adjuvant therapy, and chosen for particular treatment based on molecular analysis. The types of cancer operations and the scope of surgical resection may change as molecular techniques enhance oncologic treatment.\r"

The lymphocytic nuclei from patients with infectious mononucleosis were more lobated on visual inspection than those from normal subjects; the difference in mean form factor values was statistically significant. The simple histogram method was most discriminatory and distinguished patients with Sezary syndrome from patients with other types of lymphoid leukemias and reactive lymphocytosis, including infectious mononucleosis. The histogram method could not, however, distinguish patients with Sezary syndrome from patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Japanese T-cell leukemia. The use of bivariate graphic displays (plotting nuclear size and shape measurements) placed the lymphoid cells of the various types of lymphoproliferative disorders into distinct morphometric domains. Computerized morphometric techniques may, therefore, be of greater value when the range of possible diagnoses is large.\r"

All cases showed diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for S100 protein. Fourteen cases stained for myelin basic protein, Leu-7, or both. Immunostains for neurofilament protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein were negative in all cases. Stains for cathepsin B and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were positive in 21 and 15 cases, respectively. Cathepsin-B reactivity may reflect autodigestion of myelin, while the presence of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is less specific and may be related to cellular production of this product or to nonspecific uptake of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in serum during the formation of phagolysosomes. All tumors expressed vimentin, often in a distinctive peripheral cytoplasmic pattern. Focal desmin staining was seen in three separate specimens from the patients with the malignant GCT, but this tumor also expressed S100 protein, myelin basic protein, and Leu-7 and did not stain for muscle-specific actin. The desmin reactivity in this single case probably represents non-specific staining rather than myogenous differentiation, since the reactivity to other nerve sheath markers shows histogenetic similarity with the benign GCTs. These findings support a Schwann cell origin for nongingival GCTs and illustrate a useful panel of commercially available antibodies to diagnose these distinctive tumors.\r"

Similarly, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which reflect the presence of noradrenaline, were colocalized with neuropeptide Y. These fibers were predominantly found adjacent to and within blood vessel walls. Immunoreactivity to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was seen in varicose nerve terminals in the synoviocyte layer. Many were localized in vessel walls. There is accumulating evidence of an involvement of substance P and noradrenaline in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease and nociception.

Successful transfer of arthritis to BALB/c mice required the injection of lymphocytes from mice with arthritis, along with 50 micrograms of human fetal PG, or lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with either fetal human PG or with mouse cartilage PG. In addition, interleukin-2 or immune sera from animals with arthritis significantly reduced the time to onset of transferred disease. The onset of adoptively transferred arthritis, using cells and antigen, from the time of the first injection (38.2 +/- 18.2 days, mean +/- SD) was shortened if lymphocytes from mice with transferred arthritis were reinjected (retransferred) into other, irradiated syngeneic mice (6.1 +/- 2.6 days). The appearance of autoreactive antibodies to mouse cartilage PG in the sera of mice with adoptively transferred arthritis (secondary or tertiary) preceded the appearance of the first clinical symptoms by a few days. The transfer of arthritis was blocked by pretreatment of donor (arthritic) lymphocytes with either anti-T cell or anti-B cell antibodies and complement. Exposure of mononuclear cells from mice with arthritis to PG, and its removal prior to transfer, also resulted in transfer of the arthritis. PG-induced arthritis was not transferred to nonirradiated mice, nor to irradiated mice injected with lymphocytes from animals with primary arthritis without chondroitinase ABC-digested fetal human PG. Arthritis never developed after injection of immune sera from mice with arthritis (without cells), nor when cells of nonarthritic animals were used with chondroitinase ABC-digested fetal human PG, with or without interleukin-2.\r"

By definition, results of porphyrin studies are normal in this disease. We describe here a woman with naproxen-induced pseudoporphyria, and we review previously reported cases of pseudoporphyria. The increasing frequency of pseudoporphyria is a result of the current popularity of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Physicians need to be aware of this reversible skin disorder. Pseudoporphyria must be considered and an appropriate evaluation must be done when an individual who is taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs develops bullae and increased fragility of exposed skin.\r"

One group received ibuprofen and the other group ibuprofen plus a rib belt for analgesia. There were no statistically significant differences observed in pulmonary function testing between the groups at initial visit, 48 hours, or 5 days. Atelectasis developed in four patients, two in each treatment group; there were no cases of pneumonitis. Patients with displaced rib fractures experienced a higher rate of hemo- or pneumothorax than did those with nondisplaced fractures (5/10 v 1/10). Patients with displaced fractures who used rib belts experienced a higher rate of hemothorax than those using oral analgesia alone (4/6 v 1/4). Patients using rib belts uniformly reported a significant amount of additional pain relief. The clinician can use a rib belt to provide additional comfort to the patient with fractured ribs without apparent additional compromise to respiratory parameters. A further study stratifying displaced and nondisplaced fractures has been initiated to clarify the possible contributing roles of displaced rib fractures and the rib belt in patients with displaced fractures.\r"

To evaluate the frequency and magnitude of serum magnesium elevations after the use of repetitive magnesium catharsis, we prospectively evaluated 102 patients who received multiple doses of magnesium citrate as a part of treatment of an overdose. Commonly ingested substances for which repetitive cathartic was administered were tricyclic antidepressants in 47%, aspirin in 17%, and phenytoin in 10%. For each case, serial electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium and magnesium were obtained. Mean initial serum magnesium concentration was 1.8 +/- .03 mEq/L. After a mean 960 mL of magnesium citrate (9.22 g magnesium), final mean serum magnesium concentration was 2.5 +/- .05 mEq/L. Forty-seven patients (47%) developed an elevated (greater than 2.4 mEq/L) serum magnesium concentration, with 12 greater than 3.0 mEq/L. No correlation was found between total quantity of magnesium citrate administered and the increment in serum magnesium concentration. Our data indicate that serum magnesium concentrations consistently rise after repetitive magnesium citrate use. However, the magnitude of this rise appears modest. The elevation in serum magnesium concentration does not correlate with the quantity of magnesium administered. We conclude that with close monitoring, repetitive magnesium citrate can be administered without inducing severe hypermagnesemia (serum magnesium concentration greater than 5.0 mEq/L).\r"

Editors often blind reviewers to authors to reduce bias, but reviewers frequently recognize the author anyhow. Blinding authors to reviewers may protect the reviewer. Manuscripts rejected by one journal because of peer review are usually published in another. Since peer review serves to validate the quality of the biomedical literature, the process should be valid itself.\r"

In the patients with essential hypertension fasting insulinemia was significantly higher than in normotensive subjects (P less than .0005). The patients with secondary hypertension and the normotensive subjects had similar fasting insulinemia values. In each subgroup fasting insulinemia was higher in hypertensive patients than among normotensive subjects (P less than .05). A significant correlation between fasting insulinemia and mean blood pressure has been found in patients with essential hypertension (r = 0.408, P less than .05), but not in patients with renovascular hypertension. Our data suggest a possible direct relationship between fasting insulinemia and blood pressure, especially in obese patients or patients with impaired glucose metabolism, and that increased blood pressure per se is not an insulin resistant state.\r"

The patients were treated with spironolactone, 75 to 225 mg daily, and blood samples were withdrawn on days 7, 14, and 21 to 28 of drug administration. Plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) were not altered by spironolactone; however, significant increases were observed in plasma deoxycorticosterone on days 21 to 28 and in plasma corticosterone and cortisol on days 14 and 21 to 28. The suppressed PRA values were markedly increased on days 21 to 28 and low levels of serum potassium returned to the normal range on day 7. The lack of increase in PAC, despite a remarkable rise in PRA and serum potassium, suggests biosynthetic inhibition of spironolactone at the sites of 18-hydroxylation and/or 18-oxidation, because of the elevation of deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone.\r"

Results showed that wounds closed under the highest tension (60-mm excision group) had significantly wider scars than controls by all three measurement techniques.

A set of primers (outer set) was used in PCR to amplify a segment of the HIV-1 gag gene from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hybrids between the amplified DNA and a RNA probe were measured in a microtiter plate immunoassay using a beta-D-galactosidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody to DNA-RNA hybrids and a fluorescent substrate. A second set of primers (nested set) located within the outer set was used in PCR with a known template to prepare the probe. One primer of the nested set included the T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its 5' end allowing transcription of a single-stranded RNA probe. Ten copies of HIV-1 DNA could be detected by PCR-EIA (42 fluorescent units with a background of 18 fluorescent units) compared with a detection limit of 1000 copies by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. HIV-1 DNA was detected by PCR-EIA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 32 of 33 seropositive patients (range 54-810 fluorescent units), and 0 of 25 seronegative patients (range 20-40 fluorescent units) (sensitivity 97%; specificity 100%). PCR-EIA offers a practical and nonisotopic method to objectively measure PCR-amplified HIV-1 DNA and has the potential for the measurement of other microbial pathogens in human body fluids.\r"

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of plasma from animals that were given [3H]DS intravenously revealed an initial plasma half-life of about 30 min. Eleven percent of [3H]DS administered was recovered in the urine in 24 h; this material represented minor breakdown with a molecular weight of 4000 as determined by size exclusion HPLC analysis. When administered orally, the apparent bioavailability of [3H]DS was 6.8%, based on the recovered radioactivity; however, the molecular weight of the radioactive material obtained from the plasma was all less than 200, indicating that no detectable intact dextran sulfate was absorbed upon oral administration. Only 2% of orally administered [3H]DS was found in the 24-h urine; this material also had a molecular weight less than 200. Further less than 2300 had no anti-HIV effect and that in the presence of higher concentrations of human serum, more DS was required for antiviral effect. Although the pharmacokinetics of dextran sulfate in rats can differ from those in humans to some extent, these data suggest that oral administration of DS is unlikely to produce significant antiretroviral effect against HIV in vivo and higher plasma levels of DS may be necessary than those inferred from earlier in vitro data.\r"

The responses to the sulpha drugs were generally rapid, i.e. within 2 weeks, and the maximum doses used in any patient were 100 mg/day dapsone and 1.5 g/day of sulphapyridine or sulphamethoxypyridazine. Significant side-effects to dapsone occurred in six of the 17 patients. A trial of a sulphone or sulphonamide drug is warranted in bullous pemphigoid both as an initial treatment or in the treatment of relapse, particularly when there is a contraindication to the use of corticosteroids. Side-effects are common and therapy needs to be closely monitored.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 20 years contributions from many laboratories have led to the development of isolation procedures, delineation of primary structures, and more recently, to the expression of recombinant proteins associated with the coagulation cascade. In general, studies of coagulation proteins under defined conditions have demonstrated the prescience of Davie and Ratnoff and MacFarlane in their proposals of the coagulation cascade. The more recent discovery of thrombomodulin by Esmon et al has led to the identification and characterization of components of the vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant pathway. In this review we have attempted to analyze and compare the functional properties of each of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes associated with the procoagulant and anticoagulant phases of blood clotting. Although dissimilarities exist, the vitamin K-dependent complexes have analogous requirements and appear to function with a common general mode of organization. Membrane-bound cofactors serve as anchoring sites for the appropriate membrane-binding enzymes. This process localizes the complex on the membrane surface and increases the catalytic efficiency for substrate utilization. Complex formation provides extraordinary improvements in the catalytic efficiency for the complexes as compared with their soluble enzyme components. Membrane-bound complexes provide a mechanism that can be regulated at a site by membrane presentation, zymogen activation, and cofactor activation or presentation. The kinetic constants obtained for the various coagulation reactions determined in vitro provide some insights into how these pathways may function in vivo. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for factor X activation by factor VIIIa/factor IXa is far in excess of the catalytic efficiency of activation of factor X by tissue factor/factor VIIa (Table 3). This may provide a rational interpretation for the observation that patients with hemophilia A and B bleed even though they appear to have an alternative pathway to factor X activation. In addition, tissue factor is not ordinarily presented by the vascular tissue that has direct access to blood. However, it appears that extravascular constitutive tissue factor is available once the blood vessel becomes disrupted. The efforts to identify the initiating reactions of the blood coagulation process have not been unambiguously successful. We conclude that factor VII is most likely a zymogen, just as are the other proenzymes of the blood clotting process. In addition, it is difficult to rationalize the importance of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation involving factor XII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen since the congenital absence of any one of these factors does not result in abnormal bleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90304316\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) are characterized by the coexpression of CD5 and B-cell antigens, while hairy cell leukemias (HCL) typically express CD11c+CD5- B-cell immunophenotypes. In this report we describe the features of B-cell leukemias with CD11c+CD5+ immunophenotypes and the identification of novel circulating B-cell subsets defined by the expression of CD20, CD5, and CD11c antigens. Morphologic evaluation of 14CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias showed that they generally had larger cellular diameters (14 to 21 microns) and lower nuclear:cytoplasm ratios than typical small lymphocyte CLL. These cases did not exhibit the well-defined nucleoli characteristic of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). The presenting clinical features of CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias were most consistent with CLL or PLL, and none of the evaluated cases had pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and cytoplasmic villi characteristic of HCL. Examination of normal peripheral blood (n = 6) by three-color flow cytometry identified four novel B-cell subsets with the following immunophenotypes (mean percent of total CD20+ B cells +/- SE): CD20+CD5+CD11c+ (8.0 +/- 1.6); CD20+CD5-CD11c+ (12.0 +/- 2.0); CD20+CD5+CD11c- (35.0 +/- 4.9); and CD20+CD5-CD11c- (44.0 +/- 5.0). Our findings suggest that CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias with atypical morphologic features represent forms of CLL or PLL rather than HCL. In addition, we have identified novel subsets of circulating B cells defined by patterns of CD20, CD5, and CD11c expression that correspond to the immunophenotypes of chronic B-cell leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "Although the t(14;18) chromosome translocation has been demonstrated to be a highly consistent feature of follicular lymphomas, the underlying mechanism generating this fusion has remained uncertain. To examine this question further, a polymerase chain reaction strategy has been devised to permit the amplification and direct sequencing of the resultant 14q+ and 18q- reciprocal junctions. Direct sequence analysis of amplified 14q+ junctions established that 7 of 11 tumors contained a bcl-2 (mbr) sequence fused to an immunoglobulin JH region (five were J6 and two were J5). One of these junctions had an unusual configuration with the bcl-2 and JH sequences separated by a recognizable DH region. This finding suggests that at least some of the junctional sequences, previously thought of as N insertions, may be fragments of unrecognized DH regions. It was also possible to amplify and sequence 18q- junctions using a primer based on the DH recombination signal sequences. Several 18q- junctions were shown to consist of DH/bcl-2 (either mbr or mcr) fusions. In two tumors the 14q+ and 18q- junctions were fully sequenced, and it was demonstrated that the bcl-2 sequence was conserved during mbr and mcr translocations. This contrasts with previous analyses that demonstrated either loss or duplication of several bases at the breakpoints in the bcl-2 gene.\r"

  ".U": "90304318\r", 
  ".W": "Philadelphia (Ph')-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is highly associated with two forms of chimeric bcr-abl proteins: P190bcr-abl and P210bcr-abl. Whereas P210bcr-abl also occurs in chronic myeloid leukemia, P190bcr-abl is uniquely expressed in Ph'-positive ALL. As a consequence, P190bcr-abl is preeminently a tumor-specific marker in leukemic cells of ALL patients. Because P190bcr-abl is composed of the normal bcr and abl proteins, the major part of the P190bcr-abl molecule comprises nontumor-specific determinants. The joining region between bcr and abl, newly generated during the Ph' translocation, is exclusively a tumor-specific epitope on the P190bcr-abl molecule. Therefore, only antibodies against the bcr-abl joining region will detect the tumor-specificity of P190bcr-abl. In this study a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-ALL, was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the bcr-abl junction in P190bcr-abl. The reactivity of BP-ALL with native P190bcr-abl derived from a Ph'-positive ALL cell line (TOM-1) was tested using immunoprecipitation analysis. BP-ALL reacted highly specifically with P190bcr-abl but not with P210bcr-abl isolated from chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. Peptide inhibition studies further confirmed the fine specificity of BP-ALL. Our data indicate that the tumor-specific bcr-abl junction domain is exposed in an antigenic fashion on the P190bcr-abl molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin (B-CLL) is a disease with a variable clinical course, despite the fact that the neoplastic cells in this disorder are homogeneous with respect to morphology, immunophenotype, and cell cycle stage. To further investigate the heterogeneity observed in the clinical behavior of B-CLL, we determined the phenotype and growth requirements of clonogenic cells from 28 patients with B-CLL from low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups as defined by the Rai staging system. Using methyl-cellulose as a semi-solid media with feeder cells and/or growth factors, colonies were observed with one or more of the culture conditions tested in 25 of 28 CLLs. Phenotypic analysis of colonies demonstrated that the clonogenic cells uniformly expressed la, CD19, CD20, CD5, and the identical light chain as the original CLL cell cultured. However, heterogeneity was observed in clonogenic B-CLL cell growth among the three different CLL risk groups. Clonogenic cells from patients with low-risk CLL required either irradiated unstimulated T cells, with or without conditioned media (CM) or irradiated activated T cells alone for colony formation. Both the number of colonies (227 +/- 15) as well as the number of cells per colony (220 +/- 82) were large, with a mean cloning efficiency of 0.39%. In contrast, clonogenic cells from patients with intermediate- and high-risk CLL required the combination of both irradiated activated T cells and CM. As compared with the low-risk CLLs, both the number and size of the colonies formed by the intermediate- (74 +/- 17, 70 +/- 39) and high- (83 +/- 28, 40 +/- 14) risk groups were significantly lower (P less than .0001). Similarly, the mean cloning efficiency was significantly reduced to 0.15% and 0.14%, respectively. None of the recombinant cytokines (interleukin 1 [IL-1] to IL-7, tumor necrosis factor, alpha and gamma-interferon, B-cell growth factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) alone or in combination with each other could entirely replace the stimulatory effect of the activated T cells. These data suggest that clinical progression of B-CLL is associated with a loss of clonogenic potential in the circulating pool of neoplastic cells, which require as yet undefined factors provided by activated T cells and CM.\r"

  ".U": "90304325\r", 
  ".W": "We characterize the nature and regulation of a human neutrophil cell surface antigen recognized by monoclonal antibodies (the DREG series) against a human lymphocyte peripheral lymph node homing receptor. Human neutrophils express high levels of the DREG antigen, whose expression is downregulated after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate, or the chemotactic factors C5a and FMLP. Interestingly, C5a treatment also downregulated the monocyte DREG antigen, but had no effect on expression of the lymphocyte molecule. Within 3 minutes after treatment with C5a, greater than 80% of neutrophil DREG antigen expression is lost, and essentially the molecule is completely removed from the cell surface by 5 minutes. The human neutrophil DREG antigen is 10 Kd larger than the lymphocyte molecule. These features are similar to those of the mouse neutrophil MEL-14 antigen (murine peripheral lymph node homing receptor). The mannose-6-phosphate rich phosphomannan (PPME) binds human lymphocytes via the DREG antigen. PPME also binds neutrophils, but little difference in binding is seen between unactivated and activated cells. We show that PPME binding to unactivated neutrophils is mediated primarily by a cation- and DREG antigen-dependent mechanism, whereas activated neutrophil-PPME binding is DREG antigen- and cation-independent, and may be due to the translocation of lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate receptors to the cell surface. The DREG antibodies offer powerful tools for analyzing the role of homing receptors in human neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions, and also may prove valuable in the clinical assessment of neutrophil activation.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated 169 patients with a number of screening studies performed between 71 to 121 days after allogeneic marrow transplantation to detect the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Group 1 patients (n = 78) were asymptomatic and had normal physical examinations at the time of screening and, with a minimum of 8 years follow-up, have not developed chronic GVHD. Group 2 patients (n = 38) had signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD at time of testing. Group 3 patients (n = 53) were similar to those in group 1 in having no clinically evident GVHD at the time of testing, but later developed clinical chronic GVHD. Using time to an event analysis, we compared patients in groups 1 and 3 to determine which of 17 clinical and laboratory factors evaluated at screening accurately predicted the development of subsequent chronic GVHD. Multivariate analyses showed several factors to have independent predictive value. In the first model, results of oral biopsies were excluded since these were done only in one half of the patients. Predictive factors in this analysis included: (1) histologic findings of GVHD on skin biopsy, relative risk 3.23 (95% confidence interval 1.75 to 5.94), P = .0002; and (2) history of grade II through IV acute GVHD, relative risk 3.12 (95% confidence interval 1.72 to 5.64), P = .0002. When oral biopsy results were included in the second model, independent risk factors included: (1) histologic findings of GVHD on skin biopsy, relative risk 5.96 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 18.19), P = .0017; and (2) low numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-bearing plasma cells detected by direct immunofluorescence in salivary gland areas on oral biopsy, relative risk 11.53 (95% confidence interval 2.51 to 52.03), P = .0017. Our study demonstrates the value of day 100 screening studies for predicting subsequent development of clinical chronic GVHD.\r"

All patients were either in sensitive relapse or had adverse prognostic features, and five patients had a history of bone marrow involvement with disease. Patients received a median of 2 (1 to 3) prior chemotherapy regimens; 10 patients received local radiotherapy. After high-dose ablative therapy, greater than 500/mm3 granulocytes and greater than 20,000 untransfused platelets/mm3 were noted at a median of 23 (13 to 48) and 26 (15 to 43) days post-ABMT, respectively. Natural killer (NK) cells, T cells (predominantly T8+), and monocytes were noted within the first 1 to 2 months post-AMBT, as seen in other series. Disease-free survival was a median of 10.1 months, 5.9 months for patients with T acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma and 25.6 months for patients with T non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Toxicities were common and severe. Thirty-six percent of patients developed bacteremias early post-BMT. Late complications included a skin rash consistent with graft versus host disease; infections with Herpes zoster, hepatitis, and Pneumocystis carinii; and the development of Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative syndrome. Our findings suggest that patients who have undergone T-depleted ABMT have a profound immunodeficiency not reflected in the phenotypic reconstitution of the T and NK cells. Characterization of the functional deficiency may facilitate the development of methods to reduce the long-term toxicity of AMBT in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was evaluated in 37 patients with marrow graft failure after allogeneic (n = 15), autologous (n = 21), or syngeneic (n = 1) bone marrow transplantation. rhGM-CSF was administered by 2-hour infusion at doses between 60 and 1,000 micrograms/m2/d for 14 or 21 days. At doses of less than 500 micrograms/m2, rhGM-CSF was well-tolerated and did not exacerbate graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic transplant recipients. No patient with myelogenous leukemia relapsed while receiving rhGM-CSF. Twenty-one patients reached an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/L within 2 weeks of starting therapy while 16 did not. None of seven patients who received chemically purged autologous marrow grafts responded to rhGM-CSF. The survival rates of GM-CSF-treated patients were significantly better than those of a historical control group.\r"

The results obtained showed that anti-nef antibodies could not be detected in the sera tested independently of the appearance of antibodies specific to HIV structural proteins. Thus, the detection of anti-nef antibodies appears to be of little diagnostic value.\r"

  ".W": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by chronic refractory cytopenias resulting in increased risk of infection, bleeding, and conversion to acute leukemia. In an effort to improve these cytopenias we have treated 18 patients over a 6- to 8-week period with increasing daily subcutaneous doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Sixteen patients responded with improvement in neutrophil counts. On cessation of treatment these counts returned to baseline values over a 2- to 4-week period. To maintain these improved blood counts 11 patients were treated with G-CSF for more prolonged periods. Ten patients again responded with an increase in total leukocyte counts (1.6- to 6.4-fold) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) (3.6- to 16.3-fold), with responses persisting for 3 to 16 months. A significantly decreased risk of developing bacterial infections was noted during periods with ANC greater than 1,500/mm3 as compared with periods of time with ANC less than 1,500/mm3. Two anemic patients had a greater than 20% rise in hematocrit over the study period, and 2 additional patients had a decrease in red blood cell transfusion requirements during G-CSF treatment. Bone marrow myeloid maturation improved in 7 of 9 maintenance phase patients. Three patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia during treatment. The drug was generally well-tolerated and no severe toxicities were noted. These data demonstrated that G-CSF administered to MDS patients by daily subcutaneous administration was well-tolerated and effective in causing persistent improvement of the neutrophil levels and marrow myeloid maturation. These effects were associated with a decreased risk of infection and, in some patients, with decreased red blood cell transfusion requirements.\r"

However, migraine was significantly more common in the TGA patients than in either control group. A prospective longitudinal study using actuarial (life table) analysis confirmed that the prognosis of the TGA patients was strikingly better than that of the TIA controls. An important minority (7%) of TGA cases developed epilepsy, usually within one year of presentation. On the basis of this evidence, a thromboembolic aetiology for TGA can be confidently rejected, at least for the vast majority of cases. There are good theoretical reasons to link migraine and TGA casually, and occasionally epilepsy may masquerade as TGA. In the remaining cases the cause remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) containing neurons were characterized in human association cortex by a combination of Golgi impregnation and immunohistochemistry. Neurons were Golgi impregnated, gold toned, drawn and then classified on the basis of their dendritic and axonal arborization in layers I-VI. An antiserum to GABA was used to determine which of the impregnated neurons were immunopositive. Twenty-four GABA-positive cells were Golgi impregnated: 7 were bitufted with their dendrites predominantly radially oriented, and 17 were multipolar stellate cells. Three of the multipolar cells with large somata in the deep layers showed dendritic patterns similar to previously described basket cells. Nine of the multipolar stellate cells in layers III-VI showed characteristics of 'neurogliaform' neurons (Ramon y Cajal, 1899). The somata and the dendritic field of these cells were spherical, with diameters of about 10-15 microns and 200 microns, respectively. Their dendrites were smooth and slightly beaded. The axon collaterals were densely distributed in and around the dendritic field, in a spherical area with a diameter of at least 300 microns. The thin axon collaterals had only occasional 'en passant' swellings. Contacts between the axons of neurogliaform cells and the distal dendrites of Golgi-impregnated pyramidal cells were observed. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry revealed that GABA immunopositive nerve terminals formed symmetric synaptic contacts with somata, with GABA immunonegative and immunopositive dendritic shafts and with dendritic spines. The results show that GABAergic neurons are heterogeneous with respect to their dendritic and axonal patterns. In addition to the chandelier and basket cells, which have been shown in animal studies to contain GABA, other cell types, most prominently the neurogliaform cells, terminating on the distal parts of neurons, also contain GABA and may have a inhibitory function. Many of the GABAergic terminals make synapses on dendritic spines and shafts in the human cerebral cortex.\r"

The regimen consists of doxorubicin 32 mg/m2 i.v. and cyclophosphamide 320 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 followed by vinblastine (0.3 to 1.2 mg/m2/day), cisplatin (3 to 12 mg/m2/day), and vincristine (0.04 to 0.16 mg/m2/day) by continuous intravenous infusion on days 5 to 12. Courses are repeated every 28 days. Eighteen patients with advanced solid tumors received 37 courses of chemotherapy in a pilot study to determine safe drug concentrations for the three-drug infusion for 7 days. Dose limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. Patients who received prior mitomycin-C experienced more profound thrombocytopenia than those who did not. Nonhematologic toxicities included mild nausea, vomiting, and transient elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and serum creatinine. One patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who erroneously received vincristine 0.8 mg/m2 instead of 0.08 mg/m2 for 4 1/2 days developed transient myalgia, ileus, and a transient peripheral neuropathy; the patient achieved a sustained complete remission for 15 months and died of unrelated causes. Minor responses and stable disease were seen in two patients with renal cell carcinoma (1 and 2.5 months), three patients with colorectal carcinoma (1.5, 2, and 4 months), and one patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (2 months). The ViVACCy drug regimen can be given without undue toxicity and may be active in solid tumors.\r"

Median duration of complete response was 303 days with ten of 32 patients in continuing CR for periods varying from 44+ to 1210+ days. Apart from moderately prolonged hematologic suppression toxicity was mild and subjective side effects were tolerable. Mitoxantrone is an active agent in the treatment of acute leukemia and demonstrates incomplete cross resistance with duanorubicin. Mitoxantrone should be considered for first-line therapy in ANLL.\r"

  ".W": "Previous study has shown that the combination of mitoxantrone (Novantrone, NO) and Ara-C (AC) (NOAC) was active in refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) but myelosuppression was dose-limiting. In a pilot study, we investigated the effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) after NOAC chemotherapy in patients with refractory NHL. NO was applied at a dosage of 10 mg/m2/day on days 2 and 3 and AC at 3 g/m2/12h on days 1 and 2. RhGM-CSF was administered at 250 ug/m2/day as a continuous i.v. infusion from day 6 until the neutrophils were greater than 3.0/nl for 3 consecutive days. Twenty-three patients from five of the nine participating centers were treated with NOAC chemotherapy plus rhGM-CSF, whereas 14 patients from the other four centers received chemotherapy alone. With rhGM-CSF, the median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 0.5/nl) after NOAC was 8 days versus a median of 13 days without rhGM-CSF (P = 0.0058), and that of thrombocytopenia (less than 20.0/nl), 3 days versus 7 days (P greater than 0.4, NS). The rates of infections and stomatitis were 25% and 17%, respectively, for patients treated with rhGM-CSF as compared to 53% (P = 0.0547, NS) and 60% (P = 0.0078), respectively, without rhGM-CSF. The following side effects were associated with the administration of rhGM-CSF: pleural and/or pericardial effusions in five patients, thrombosis in two patients, bone pain in two patients, and respiratory distress syndrome in one patient. A complete remission was achieved in nine of the 23 patients treated with NOAC plus rhGM-CSF, and in two of the 14 patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The median survival of patients treated with rhGM-CSF was not reached at 400 days and seemed to be longer than that of patients treated with chemotherapy alone (median, 109 days; P = 0.036). RhGM-CSF after chemotherapy can be applied safely to patients with NHL, shorten the period of severe cytopenia, reduce the rates of stomatitis, and did not seem to cause adverse effects on response.\r"

All patients received lorazepam (1.5 mg/m2) and metoclopramide (2.0 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) 30 minutes before cisplatin, with the same dose of metoclopramide repeated 1.5, 3.5, 6.5, and 9.5 hours after the 30-minute cisplatin infusion. Patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo by slow bolus injection 30 minutes before cisplatin. All patients were hospitalized for 24 hours and evaluated by observation after cisplatin and a patient questionnaire before discharge. Eighteen patients received metoclopramide and lorazepam without dexamethasone: six (33%) reported no vomiting and four (22%) reported no nausea or vomiting. Nineteen patients also received dexamethasone: 14 (74%) had no vomiting and 13 (68%) reported no nausea or vomiting. These differences were statistically significantly different (P = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). The side effects attributable to the antiemetic regimen were somnolence (100%), confusion (8%), and diarrhea (46%), and were the same in both arms. Dexamethasone significantly improved the antiemetic efficacy of metoclopramide plus lorazepam without adding toxicity. This three-drug combination gave a high rate of control of acute emesis induced by high-dose cisplatin.\r"

Implant doses of 1500 to 2000 cGy were combined with 4500 to 5000 cGy of external irradiation. External irradiation was given preoperatively for larger lesions near bone or neurovascular structures, whereas it was used postoperatively for smaller, more resectable lesions or those that had previously been inadequately excised. There were 47 high-grade tumors, 34 tumors greater than 5 cm, and nine patients with recurrent lesions (five with previous irradiation). With mean follow-up of 20 months, conclusions on local control are tentative, but only two of 56 tumors (4%) with brachytherapy as part of initial management had recurred locally and three of nine recurrent tumors had re-recurred locally. Only one of five local recurrences was within the implanted volume. Only two of 40 implantations (5%) performed at initial resection followed by postoperative external irradiation led to wound complications, whereas four of 16 implantations (25%) performed at resection after preoperative external irradiation were associated with wound problems. This technique does not increase local morbidity and may enhance local tumor control in comparison with either external radiation or brachytherapy alone as an adjuvant to conservative resection.\r"

Abdominal CT scans within 90 days of death were reviewed twice by two radiologists blinded to the autopsy diagnosis. The likelihood of metastatic spread in each adrenal gland was scored on a five-level scale. Histopathologic findings at autopsy were used to establish the presence or absence of metastases. The sensitivity of CT was low. Among 53 adrenal glands with proven metastatic lesions, the proportion with positive CT scans varied from 20.0% to 41.1%, according to the positivity threshold. In contrast, the specificity of CT was high, even at relaxed positivity thresholds, from 84.5% to 99.4%. The relatively low sensitivity of CT to detect adrenal metastatic lesions is explained to a large extent by the lack of substantial structural changes in many adrenal glands found to have metastases at autopsy. With a strongly positive CT scan, the probability of an adrenal metastatic lesion is high, and confirmatory adrenal biopsy may not be needed in patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.\r"

The three types of SHCC are as follows: type I, noncapsule type; type II, capsule type; and type III, infiltrative type. Of the SHCC, 73.3% had diploid DNA content, and 84.6% of LHCC had aneuploid DNA content. The postoperative 5-year survival rate of patients with SHCC was 62.1%, which is higher than the rate of 27.7% of patients with LHCC. There was no correlation between tumor size and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The results suggest that the period when SHCC are 3 cm in size may be important as the changes of DNA stemlines and biological characteristics would occur then. The SHCC of less than 3 cm reflect relatively benign biological behavior of early hepatocellular carcinoma and this period is the best opportunity for the clinician to get the best prognosis. Currently determination of serum AFP is still one of the possible and effective methods to early finding SHCC.\r"

Lectin staining patterns of 22 colectomy specimens from patients with familial polyposis coli (FPC) and rectal biopsy specimens from 47 patients at risk for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (also known as Lynch syndromes I and II) were compared with rectal biopsy specimens from 27 sex-matched controls. The fluorescein-conjugated lectins included the agglutinins derived from peanut, Dolichos biflorus, Ulex europeus, and wheat germ (including the succinylated derivative). Using a technique for quantitating lectin binding on the tissue sections that provided a score from 0 to 400, labeling with certain lectins was found to vary slightly as a function of age and sex. Histologically normal mucosa from patients with FPC bound significantly less wheat germ agglutinin but significantly more U. europeus and succinylated wheat germ agglutinins than controls. Adenomas and dysplastic flat mucosa from the colectomy specimens of patients with FPC showed significantly less binding with D. biflorus, succinylated wheat germ, and wheat germ agglutinins than controls. Rectal tissues from patients at risk for HNPCC were found to bind significantly less peanut agglutinin and D. biflorus agglutinin than controls. Of interest, staining of the tissues by peanut and wheat germ lectins increased as a function of patient age; the control subjects were older than the patients with familial colon cancer, which could possibly account for the observations made with these two lectins. These results provide evidence that the premalignant colonic epithelium in familial polyposis and the hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndromes may be biologically different and indicate that glycoconjugate modifications are early events in the evolution of the neoplastic phenotype.\r"

The tumor specimens were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. The BrdU labeling index, S-phase fraction, was determined by counting the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the tissue sections. S-phase fraction correlates with the results of histologic tumor grade, Gleason score, and growth patterns. The higher S-phase fraction may indicate biologic malignancy. Moreover, the degree of heterogeneity concerning S-phase fraction distribution within prostate cancer tissue could be evaluated and the findings compared with the morphologic appearance. The authors results suggest that the measurement of BrdU labeling index in prostate cancer may prove to be a new objective and quantitative assay for biologic potential of individual tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant histiocytosis (MH) is a term that has been used to describe a syndrome in which there is a systemic proliferation of cells that have the cytologic appearance of atypical histiocytes. Biopsy materials from 15 patients with malignant lymphoma diagnosed as malignant histiocytosis in a previous study reported in 1975 were analyzed by a panel of antibodies and reclassified using current nosologic concepts of malignant lymphoma. The antibodies used comprised reagents detecting a formalin-resistant epitope on B-cells (L26), T-cells (anti-CD3, anti-leu 22 [CD43], and UCHL1 [CD45RO]), monocyte/macrophage-derived cells (KP1 [CD68]), as well as antibodies that detect leukocyte common antigen (PD7 [CD45RB]), and a formalin-resistant epitope of Ki-1 (Ber-H2 [CD30]). The authors found that nine lymphomas had a profile consistent with T-lineage, including six in which Ki-1 (CD30) was coexpressed, and two were B-lineage. Three lymphomas showed no specific lineage characteristics although two were Ki-1 (CD30) positive, and none had expression of KP1 (CD68). The 12 lymph node biopsy specimens showed a variety of patterns of involvement, including sinusoidal, paracortical, and diffuse; the spleens showed predominantly red pulp involvement. A 15th case was believed most consistent with a virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. These findings support previous suggestions that the majority of cases diagnosed as MH represent T-lineage-associated hematolymphoid neoplasms, and that only a rare case will be of monocyte/macrophage origin. It is suggested that the term MH be subsumed under the rubric of large cell lymphoma and unless there are compelling immunohistochemical data to support a histiocytic origin, that the term MH be abandoned in favor of a more accurate descriptive term, such as sinusoidal large cell lymphoma.\r"

Among those eligible for rescreening, BSE competence scores based on seven BSE criteria significantly improved over time and correlated directly with reported BSE frequencies. Among all participants, the proportion reporting BSE frequencies of greater than or equal to 12/year increased over time from approximately 20% on entry to 50% to 64% at final screen. Similarly, reports of zero frequency diminished from 50% to 10% to 15%. Variables such as educational status, age (fifth versus sixth decades), eligibility for mammography, smoking history, and ethnic origin had negligible or no influence on BSE competence. However, women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer had significantly higher BSE scores. NBSS experience suggests that most women who enter screening programs will upgrade their BSE skills if subjected to brief episodes of repeated BSE instruction.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the accuracy of angiographic methods for analysis of left ventricular regional wall motion, we measured the ability of a carefully performed subjective analysis (three independent observers) and that of three computer-assisted methods (centerline, radial, and area) to detect the presence of significant coronary artery disease. Normal ranges were established in 90 studies showing normal wall motion, and accuracy was tested in a second, consecutive series of 43 ventriculograms. The results show that the subjective method best separated those regions with from those without significant coronary disease. The subjective method also demonstrated sensitivity comparable to the centerline and radial methods. Among the computer-assisted methods, the area method was least sensitive but most specific for both anterior and inferior region coronary disease. The centerline and radial methods were highly sensitive, but less specific. When coronary disease was defined by electrocardiographic Q-waves, the area method had superior accuracy. Further analysis showed the following: 1) For the centerline and radial methods, long-axis reregistration of the end-systolic frame resulted in loss of sensitivity but increased specificity for anterior wall coronary disease, and little change in analysis of the inferior wall; 2) inclusion or exclusion of the apex had little effect on predictive accuracy for anterior wall coronary disease; 3) as expected, sensitivity and specificity results of all methods were dependent on the selection of a normal range cutoff value; but when performance was optimized, the subjective and area methods had a higher overall predictive accuracy than the centerline method; 4) It is likely that all three computer-assisted methods could be calibrated to give indications of degrees of hypokinesis, as their results correlated well with subjective observers' evaluations over the entire range of scores. These results should assist in selection of the optimal method for regional wall motion analysis in clinical and research applications. As currently applied, the area method is the most specific of the computer-assisted methods tested; the centerline and radial methods have highest sensitivity and therefore are most suited to detection of mild degrees of hypokinesis.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo endotoxin infusion produces neutrophil-mediated acute lung injury and increases superoxide anion release from phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated blood neutrophils collected 18-24 hours after the infusion. Because the turnover time of circulating blood neutrophils is only 6-8 hours, it was hypothesized that the prolonged increase in superoxide anion release from peripheral blood neutrophils is associated with increased superoxide anion release from bone marrow neutrophils. To test this hypothesis, two doses of Escherichia coli endotoxin (5.0 and 0.5 micrograms/kg) were infused into chronically instrumented awake sheep. Blood and bone marrow neutrophils were collected 24 hours after the infusion, and superoxide anion release from unstimulated and PMA-stimulated neutrophils was measured in vitro. Endotoxin infusion produced an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability, in intravascular activation (degranulation) of blood neutrophils, and in circulating blood neutrophils 24 hours after the infusion. High-dose endotoxin (5.0 micrograms/kg; n = 4) increased superoxide anion release from unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils (2.25 +/- 0.38 times baseline [p less than or equal to 0.05]) and from peripheral blood neutrophils stimulated with 10(-9) M PMA in vitro (1.46 +/- 0.55 times baseline). Low-dose endotoxin (0.5 micrograms/kg; n = 5), on the other hand, did not alter superoxide anion release from peripheral blood neutrophils. Bone marrow neutrophils could not be isolated reproducibly after high-dose endotoxin because of leukoaggregation. Bone marrow neutrophils were isolated after low-dose endotoxin infusion. Stimulation of these cells with 10(-9) M PMA in vitro resulted in a two- to fourfold increase above control release (p less than or equal to 0.05). Increased superoxide anion release from both peripheral blood and bone marrow neutrophils occurred in the absence of circulating endotoxin, as measured by a Limulus assay. These results show that the prolonged increase in superoxide anion release from peripheral blood neutrophils is associated with an increase in the superoxide anion release from bone marrow neutrophils. Furthermore, the recruitment of affected bone marrow neutrophils into peripheral blood may explain the increased superoxide anion release from blood neutrophils 24 hours after endotoxin infusion.\r"

The power ratio estimated the degree of stenosis within 10% of error. Ensemble average of the power ratio was computed to obtain the statistically averaged separated flow region.

We found that rat aortic smooth muscle cells attach to surfaces coated with fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I and IV. Cell attachment to these substrates appears to be mediated by members of the beta 1 integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Antibodies to the beta 1 subunit not only demonstrated the presence of integrin complexes in focal adhesion plaques but also blocked cell adhesion to the different substrates. Ligand-affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isolated a series of receptor complexes that were recognized by antisera to beta 1 integrin receptors. Each of the receptors appeared to be a heterodimer in which one of several alpha subunits shared a common 120-kDa (nonreduced) beta 1 subunit protein. The rat aortic smooth muscle cells had one alpha subunit (150 kDa nonreduced, 140 kDa reduced) that bound exclusively to fibronectin. There was a second alpha subunit (150 kDa nonreduced, 160 kDa reduced) that bound exclusively to collagen type I. In addition, there was a third alpha subunit (185 kDa nonreduced, 200 kDa reduced) that was promiscuous and bound to collagen types I and IV as well as to laminin; the 185-kDa alpha subunit appeared to bind to collagen more efficiently than it did to laminin. Thus, smooth muscle cells express multiple integrin receptors with different ligand specificities that appear to mediate cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.\r"

Calpain II, an endogenous cytosolic protease, was used to selectively degrade the high molecular weight protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, and its effects on the activity of the Ca2+ release channel and [3H]ryanodine binding sites were analyzed. Degradation of the high molecular weight protein was associated with appearance of 315,000 and 150,000 Da proteolytic fragments and with a change in the ultrastructure of the \"feet,\" extravesicular projections that protrude from the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The maximal number of [3H]ryanodine binding sites and the affinities of the sites for ryanodine were not remarkably affected by calpain II. Ca2+ release channels recorded from nondegraded cardiac and skeletal membrane vesicle preparations had slope conductances of 85 and 110 pS, respectively, measured with 1 microM cis-Ca2+ and 50 mM trans-Ba2+. Proteolysis did not alter the unitary channel conductances but did increase the percentage of channel open times from 36% to more than 90%. After proteolysis, channel opening remained dependent on micromolar cis-Ca2+, and high concentrations of ryanodine (300 microM) still blocked the channel. Our results suggest that proteolysis of the Ca2+ release channel with calpain II selectively impairs its inactivation, leaving its unitary conductance and the requirement for micromolar Ca2+ intact.\r"

To study whether low concentrations of endothelin-1 potentiate the effects of other vasoconstrictor hormones, we suspended isolated human internal mammary and left anterior descending coronary artery rings in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In mammary artery rings, the contractions to norepinephrine (3 x 10(-8) M) were potentiated by threshold (3 x 10(-10) M) and low concentrations (10(-9) M) of endothelin-1 (96 +/- 35% and 149 +/- 58% increase from control; p less than 0.01 and 0.001; n = 6). The inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide formation L-NG-monomethyl arginine did not affect the potentiating effects of the peptide. The calcium antagonist darodipine (10(-7) M) prevented the potentiation of the response to norepinephrine evoked by endothelin-1. Similarly, contractions to serotonin (10(-7) or 3 x 10(-8) M) were amplified by endothelin-1 (3 x 10(-10) M) in the mammary (30 +/- 9%) and in the coronary arteries (59 +/- 25%). Endothelin-1 (10(-9) M) further potentiated the response (57 +/- 23% in mammary and 87 +/- 26% in coronary arteries; p less than 0.05; n = 7 and 3).

  ".U": "90305098\r", 
  ".W": "Premature escape beats induced in conscious dogs with chronic complete atrioventricular block have been defined as escape beats occurring on cessation of overdrive pacing and having a coupling interval to the last paced beat shorter than the coupling interval between the premature escape beat and the second postpacing beat. Triggered activity has been proposed as the primary underlying mechanism. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study the effects of overdrive pacing on normal automatic canine Purkinje fibers to determine if premature escape beats could be induced and if so, to define the underlying cellular mechanism(s). For this purpose, we overdrive-paced Purkinje fibers for 10 and 50 seconds and for 10 and 50 beats at a pacing cycle length (PCL) of 1,000-200 msec. In addition, to help distinguish among major arrhythmogenic mechanisms, we used a matrix of drugs consisting of propranolol, nadolol, lidocaine, ethmozin, and doxorubicin. Fifty-second stimulation trains induced \"classic\" overdrive suppression of the first three postpacing impulses, whereas 10-second overdrive pacing induced significant overdrive suppression only at a PCL of 200 msec. With 50-beat overdrive pacing and a PCL of 1,000-600 msec, there was overdrive suppression of postpacing impulses, whereas reduced overdrive suppression was observed at a PCL of 400-200 msec. Ten-beat stimulation trains induced a \"flat response\" of postpacing impulses. Ten- and 50-beat overdrive pacing provoked premature escape beats in 66% of the fibers, with the higher incidence at a PCL of 200 msec for 50-beat stimulation trains. No shortening of the coupling interval of premature escape beats was observed at faster pacing rates. Only lidocaine (which suppresses normal automaticity) abolished premature escape beats. We conclude that normal automaticity is the most likely mechanism underlying premature escape beats in Purkinje fibers with high levels of membrane potential.\r"

  ".W": "The 5-year incidence of myocardial infarction and claudication was examined in a group of middle-aged patients (n = 133, 70 men and 63 women) with newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 144, 62 men and 82 women). The effects of general risk factors, plasma insulin level, and lipoprotein abnormalities on the incidence of myocardial infarction and claudication were also evaluated by univariate analyses in both diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects and by multivariate analyses combining both groups. The age-adjusted incidence of myocardial infarction was higher both in diabetic men (19.4%) and diabetic women (11.0%) than in nondiabetic men (3.2%, p = 0.009) and nondiabetic women (3.0%, p = 0.047). Similarly, the age-adjusted incidence of claudication was higher among the diabetic patients (20.3% vs. 8.0% for men, p = 0.06; 21.8% vs. 4.2% for women, p = 0.003). None of the general risk factors (i.e., low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, and high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol) showed an association with the risk of myocardial infarction either in the diabetic or nondiabetic groups of subjects, but an ischemic electrocardiographic abnormality at the baseline examination predicted myocardial infarction in diabetic men. In univariate analyses in diabetic subjects, high serum total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, high very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and high total, LDL and VLDL triglycerides, and in nondiabetic subjects, high VLDL cholesterol and LDL triglycerides were associated with the appearance of claudication. In multivariate analyses including both diabetic and control subjects, only diabetes had an independent association with myocardial infarction, whereas smoking, high LDL triglycerides or VLDL cholesterol, and high fasting plasma insulin showed independent relations to claudication. The present results indicate that changes in lipoprotein composition characteristic of non-insulin-dependent diabetes are atherogenic and increase the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Furthermore, high plasma insulin might also be involved in atherogenesis, independent of lipoprotein abnormalities.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene amplification is a sensitive, specific technique ideally suited for the diagnosis of viral disease in small tissue samples where low copy numbers of the viral genome may be present. Using PCR and high stringency condition, we screened biopsies taken from 48 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy. Five patients demonstrated positive enteroviral signals by PCR; two of them had myocarditis by pathology, whereas the other three had changes consistent with cardiomyopathy. Four other patients had myocarditis diagnosed by pathology from 3 months to 1 year earlier but were now negative by both PCR and pathology. Both pathology and PCR were negative for active myocarditis in all other patients. Ventricular samples taken from left ventricular myectomy in four additional patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, normal human ventricle samples, and uninfected monkey kidney cells were also negative by PCR. This study supports a link between viral infection and dilated cardiomyopathy in some patients. PCR gene amplification provides a new diagnostic approach to patients with suspected myocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Prospective evaluation of the one-stage procedure in 32 patients who suffered from 37 severe friction-avulsion injuries was carried out. Most injuries (81%) were in the lower extremity. Split-thickness skin excision was used for immediate diagnosis of flap vascularity and wound coverage. Split-thickness skin was harvested from the avulsed flap surfaces after they were temporarily sutured back to their original bed. Dermal capillary bleeding served as an indicator for tissue viability, thus delineating a clear line for debridement. All compartments were decompressed, and debridement of all devascularized tissues was performed. Most fractures were fixed with interfragmentary screws and external fixators. Viable parts of the avulsed flaps were sutured back to their original bed and exposed bones were covered with transposed muscles. Skin defects were grafted with the split-thickness skin that was harvested in the first stage and was meshed 1:3 to allow drainage. Most patients (26 out of 32) had only one surgical procedure for their extensive injuries. The split-thickness skin excision is effective in the establishment of debridement borders and helps in saving maximal viable flap area (49.4%). All wounds healed with no major wound complications. The split-thickness skin excision can be used immediately in the care of severe crush injuries, compartment syndromes, and open fractures as a one-stage procedure with the following advantages: (1) reliable diagnosis of flap vascularity, (2) immediate wound coverage with the possibility of drainage, (3) elimination of further debridements procedures, (4) elimination of distant skin donor wounds, and (5) less hospitalization.\r"

With the patients supine, their knees flexed 90 degrees, and their lower legs strapped in the vertical position, one scan only of the proximal femur was needed to measure the anteversion by ultrasound. The transducer was tilted until the desired measuring line appeared horizontal on the monitor screen. The angle of tilt of the transducer, which represented the AV angle, was measured with an attached clinometer. The correlation between ultrasound and roentgenographic AV angles was high, indicating that reliable results were obtained by ultrasound. The preferred reference line was the head-trochanter tangent, which is recommended for clinical use. Consistently greater AV values were measured by ultrasound than by roentgenography. Thus, 10 degrees should be subtracted from the ultrasound values in order to obtain the real AV angles. One of the benefits of ultrasound is the elimination of radiation hazards to the patients. Ultrasound is recommended as a screening technique for patients with rotational disorders of the femur.\r"

The implantation of a viable de novo cartilage plug into such defects may provide the appropriate cartilage presence necessary to inhibit the initial formation of bony bridges across the epiphysis and so maintain the growth potential. De novo cartilage plugs were prepared from ovine growth plates by culturing isolated epiphyseal chondrocytes from fetal lambs. After 14 days of culture, these de novo cartilage discs were composed of chondroitin sulfate, a small amount (5%) of dermatan sulfate, and cartilage-specific collagen. The cellular morphology and the histochemistry resembled resting zones of normal growth-plate cartilage. Those de novo cartilage discs, which had been embedded in gelled Type I collagen, retained their morphology and could be easily manipulated. On the other hand, Type II collagen and a polyuronic acid gauze (Surgicel) were not satisfactory substrates to facilitate subsequent transplantation into growth-plate defects. The use of 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CSFE) throughout the cultures of epiphyseal chondrocytes or prolonged incorporation of [3H]-thymidine appeared to label the cells with useful markers for following their fate subsequent to implantation in vivo.\r"

In that context, the article presents a comprehensive view of the need for feedback in myoelectric prostheses. The difficulties of designing transducers to meet the stringent demands of prosthetics applications are considered, and problems inherent in several alternatives are identified. Various means of conveying feedback information to the amputee are reviewed in some detail. The concept of feedback in control systems is introduced in the context of closed-loop control of a prosthesis. The surprisingly good performance of skilled users of myoelectric prostheses is noteworthy implying that the distinction between sensory and proprioceptive feedback may be somewhat artificial. By integrating these two feedback types a satisfactory feedback system may become an attainable goal.\r"

Prosthetic training techniques now take into account the amputee's recreational and sports needs and desires, using advanced athletic training concepts to achieve superior performance in a wide variety of activities. The surgeon, as a key member of the amputee team, should be aware of these profound changes so that they may contribute his or her skill in surgically crafting an optimally functional residual limb. This will allow the amputee to reach for the maximum in cardiopulmonary fitness while achieving social reintegration after amputation. The combination of skills, concepts, and techniques of the amputation surgeon, prosthetist, and therapist/trainer has led to a unique situation, in which for the first time, amputees are able to successfully compete in sports because of their prostheses, rather than in spite of them.\r"

The authors examined the hypothesis that objective data, available early in the evaluation of patients with severe skeletal/soft-tissue injuries of the lower extremity with vascular compromise, might discriminate the salvageable from the unsalvageable limbs. The Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) was developed by reviewing 25 trauma victims with 26 severe lower-extremity open fractures with vascular compromise. The four significant criteria (with increasing points for worsening prognosis) were skeletal/soft-tissue injury, limb ischemia, shock, and patient age. (There was a significant difference in the mean MESS scores; 4.88 in 17 limbs salvaged and 9.11 in nine limbs amputated; p less than 0.01). This scoring system was then prospectively evaluated in 26 lower-extremity open fractures with vascular injury over a 12-month period at two trauma centers. Again, there was a significant difference in the mean MESS scores; 4.00 for the 14 salvaged limbs and 8.83 for the 12 amputated limbs (p less than 0.01). In both the prospective and retrospective studies, a MESS score of greater than or equal to 7 had a 100% predictable value for amputation. This relatively simple, readily available scoring system of objective criteria was highly accurate in acutely discriminating between limbs that were salvageable and those that were unsalvageable and better managed by primary amputation.\r"

Low fT3, normal fT4, and normal or high rT3 as found in most patients were consistent with a variant of the euthyroid sick syndrome although TSH was elevated in some patients. Cortisol, insulin, and lactate levels were also normal or high. No correlation was found between low thyroid hormones and elevated lactate or the amount of vasopressor needed to sustain BP. No significant changes occurred in hormone or lactate levels after brain death.

  ".W": "Pulmonary dysfunction is a common complication of severe head injury. The degree of initial hypoxemia which develops appears to correspond with the location and magnitude of the head injury. If unrecognized and not aggressively treated, the hypoxic insult will magnify the cerebral insult. A severe postinjury hypermetabolic state also develops and, if unrecognized and not managed aggressively with nutritional support, can also lead to severe catabolism, increased infection, and further lung dysfunction. Although supportive care is the major treatment at present, pharmacologic manipulation of the increased catecholamine activity, which is considered to be causative, may be effective in controlling both the impaired gas exchange and the hypermetabolic state. A knowledge of the various lung dysfunction states which occur in the head-injured patient population is required to optimize recovery and minimize complications.\r"

A double-blind randomized crossover trial for individual ulcerative colitis patients (single-patient trial, or N of 1 clinical trial) was designed to study the safety, patient acceptance, and the effectiveness of nicotine gum in improving patient symptoms and proctoscopic appearance of involved colon. Seven nonsmoking patients chewed up to 10 squares/day (20 mg) of nicotine gum or placebo gum for two weeks. Therapy was crossed-over every two weeks over the eight-week trial. Effectiveness was judged from comparisons between nicotine-gum and placebo-gum periods of patient self-reported symptoms at the conclusion of each two-week period using visual analog scales and proctoscopic appearance using ordered categorical scales. Three of seven patients, all three of whom were former smokers, demonstrated sufficient improvement without adverse effects to warrant institution of nicotine gum into their drug treatment regimens. Three patients demonstrated an uncertain response, despite tolerating the drug, and have not had nicotine gum added to their regimens. One patient could not tolerate the medication and was withdrawn from the study. No serious side effects were noted. We conclude that a randomized trial for an individual patient is a useful method for evaluating treatment regimens for ulcerative colitis and that nicotine gum may be effective therapy for individual patients with ulcerative colitis who demonstrate an objective response with few adverse effects.\r"

Rats received 1 ml of saline, or 50% or 100% ethanol orally. After 30 min, tissue samples of the glandular stomach were retrieved, cryosectioned, and incubated with one of a panel of lectins. Another set of sections was preincubated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues. Qualitative evaluation of lectin binding showed that although several different sites stained, concanavalin A was the only lectin to stain the extracellular matrix, and soybean agglutinin the only lectin to stain chief cells. Neuraminidase preincubation enhanced lectin binding to both stained and previously unstained sites. Ethanol, both 50% and 100%, produced changes in both neuraminidase-treated and untreated tissues, increasing the specific binding of concanavalin A, Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, and wheat germ agglutinin, while decreasing Helix pomatia agglutinin and soybean agglutinin. These results suggest that ethanol can, through unknown mechanisms, alter carbohydrate binding affinity.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the \"mucoid cap\" of mucus, fibrin, and cellular debris that forms over sites of superficial gastric damage to provide a relatively high-pH microenvironment was investigated in the rat. Furthermore, the effects of administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or reduction of mucosal blood flow on this microenvironment were investigated. Superficial mucosal damage induced by a 2-minute exposure to hypertonic saline produces a mucoid cap that has a pH of 4-6 despite the presence in the lumen of a solution of acid with a pH of less than 1. This relatively high-pH microenvironment remained even when the exposure to 0.15-mol/L HCl was continued for as long as 1 hour. Intraperitoneal administration of indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or naproxen (10 mg/kg) resulted, within 10-25 minutes, in complete dissipation of this high-pH microenvironment, with the subsequent development of hemorrhagic erosions. These effects of indomethacin and naproxen occurred subsequent to significant inhibition of gastric prostaglandin synthesis by these agents. Rapid dissipation of the pH gradient could also be produced by brief (30-second) clamping of the arterial blood supply to the chambered mucosa or by systemic administration of a vasoconstrictor (endothelin-1), in both cases resulting in the development of hemorrhagic erosions. These results show that the mucoid cap over sites of superficial damage provides a relatively high-pH microenvironment and that dissipation of this microenvironment by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis or by reduction of mucosal blood flow can convert sites of superficial mucosal injury to hemorrhagic erosions. Such inhibitory effects might contribute to the ulcerogenic actions of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\r"

  ".W": "A prolonged randomized, prospective, double-blind, crossover study, including a sham-sham-treated group, was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 500-mL gastric bubble (Ballobes; DOT ApS, Rodovre, Denmark) as an adjunct to diet, physical training, and behavioral modification. Only supermorbidly obese patients who fulfilled the usual criteria for surgery were admitted. A weight loss of 38 kg in the first 17 weeks and another 12 kg in the second 18 weeks could be achieved. The body mass index, the percentage of overweight and the loss in percentage of initial weight, paralleled this impressive weight loss. In the second period, a plateau effect occurred after the massive changes in the first period, and only one third of the changes in all parameters was seen. Stratification into a sham-sham, sham-balloon, balloon-sham, and balloon-balloon group did not show any statistical difference for all parameters between the four groups. The double-blind nature of the study was affirmed by the patient's correct judgment of the presence or absence of a balloon in only 21% of the balloon and 44% of the sham procedures. Gastrointestinal complications were infrequent and consisted of erosions (three patients), asymptomatic reflux oesophagitis (one patient), and asymptomatic gastric ulcer (one patient). Only the latter patient had elevated gastrin levels. One patient could not tolerate the balloon. All balloons remained airtight during both parts of the study for a mean of 123 days. This study confirmed the safety of the balloon, but no additional benefit could be ascribed to the balloon compared with a very low-calorie diet and medical and dietary support.\r"

Costaining was also performed for joining chain, which is a key factor in the epithelial transport of secretory antibodies; its expression by immunoglobulin A2 cells was only marginally reduced in untreated patients (96%) compared with treated patients and controls (98%). Also, immunoglobulin A1 cells showed similar joining chain positivity (89%) in all three groups. Considering the expanded total jejunal immunoglobulin A-cell population and the subclass-associated joining chain expression, it could be calculated that the potential of immunoglobulin A2 cells for contribution to secretory immunity was increased 3.9 times in untreated (P less than 0.01) and 1.8 times in treated (P less than 0.05) patients and that of immunoglobulin A1 cells was increased 1.7 times in untreated (P less than 0.05) but remained unaltered in treated patients. The estimated relative contributions of locally produced immunoglobulin A2 to secretory immunoglobulin A would thus be 51% and 37% in the two patient categories, respectively, compared with 31% in the controls. These data suggested enhanced secretory immunity in celiac disease and might reflect a protective, possibly antimicrobial, immune response. It could not be excluded, however, that increased generation of secretory immunoglobulin A at the same time contributes to the gluten-induced pathogenesis of celiac disease.\r"

Within and around lymphoid follicles, most T cells expressed the restricted common leucocyte antigen (CD45R, displayed by unprimed T cells). Conversely, most lamina propria T cells were negative for CD45R but stained positively with UCHL1 (a monoclonal antibody recognizing an antigen displayed by primed T lymphocytes). The proportions of T-lymphocyte subpopulations in normal and inflamed mucosa were similar, except that CD6-negative, CD7-positive cells were significantly more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. A characteristic feature of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis was marked infiltration by CD45R+ lymphoid cells that did not coexpress T- or B-cell surface antigens; some stained positively with plasma cell reagents, suggesting that they may be activated B cells. The observations in the colitis sections are consistent with the interpretation that T and B cells alter their surface antigen expression as they emerge from follicles and enter the inflamed lamina propria.\r"

Because the alpha-fetoprotein level of the studied cases ranged from 60-1,500,000 ng/mL (60-1,500,000 micrograms/L), mostly greater than 200 ng/mL (200 micrograms/L), additional patients with lower levels of alpha-fetoprotein [16-177 ng/mL (16-177 micrograms/L) for 16 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis and 28-185 ng/mL (28-185 micrograms/L) for 17 cases of liver cirrhosis alone] were analyzed for alpha-fetoprotein-L3 and alpha-fetoprotein-P4. The resulting sensitivity for combined evaluation was still as high as 88% at the same high specificity of 99.7%, indicating that the simultaneous analysis of alpha-fetoprotein-L3 and alpha-fetoprotein-P4 is effective in monitoring the evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients.\r"

It is also the organ responsible for absorbing dietary and endogenously produced biliary cholesterol. Cholesterol metabolism in the intestine is regulated by factors that will alter cellular cholesterol requirements. Thus, during increased cholesterol flux, which occurs by bile acid-faciliated cholesterol absorption or by lipoprotein-mediated uptake of cholesterol, cholesterol synthetic rates decrease and esterification rates increase. The mechanisms by which dietary fats regulate intestinal cholesterol metabolism are complex. Dietary fats alter membrane fatty acid composition. Simultaneously, they also promote lipoprotein secretion and alter cholesterol absorption. Intestinal 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase activity is regulated by enzyme phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. The regulation of acylcoenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase activity by this mechanism remains controversial. Data on hormone regulation of intestinal cholesterol metabolism are not conclusive, although progesterone seems to be a potent inhibitor of acylcoenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in intestinal cell culture and isolated cells. In a manner similar to the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in other cells, the enterocyte responds appropriately to factors that alter cholesterol flux. Therefore, changes that occur in the rates of cholesterol synthesis and esterification will reflect the cholesterol requirements of the cell.\r"

However, the need for emergency surgical intervention was less frequent in the heat probe group (2 of 30) than among the controls (9 of 31) (p = 0.0243). Moreover, in the treatment group, those patients of advanced age (greater than 60 years), in shock, requiring blood transfusion of greater than 500 ml, and in whom blood or coffee ground material was seen in the stomach, thermocoagulation achieved statistically more effective hemostasis than that observed in the control group. For these high-risk subsets of patients with non-bleeding visible vessels, we recommend heat probe coagulation rather than mere observation.\r"

In both groups, blood flow was highest in the fundus, followed by the body and lowest in the antrum; the angularis had a high blood flow, second only to the fundus.

Strokes in these patients rarely occur in the same vascular distribution as the bruit. In prospective studies, an asymptomatic bruit does not identify patients at higher risk of perioperative stroke even in patients undergoing coronary bypass or other major vascular surgery. When a stroke occurs in the perioperative setting, it is much more likely due to embolism from the cross-clamped aorta or extraneous material from the bypass machine than from hypoperfusion of, or embolism from, the carotid arteries.\r"

Six autopsy cases (five women and one man) of primary biliary cirrhosis associated with hepatocellular carcinoma were obtained from several Japanese institutions and examined. All cases were in an established cirrhotic stage of primary biliary cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma was incidentally found at autopsy in four cases and, in these, the carcinomas were small in size and number. The other two cases showed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and one case showed extrahepatic metastasis. Histologically, all cases showed well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Fatty changes or bile plugs were frequently seen within the tumors. Mallory body clusters and focal deposition of copper-binding protein were consistently found in cirrhotic liver tissues and also in the carcinoma tissues of almost all cases. The presence of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia in the peripheries of some carcinomas suggested that hepatocellular carcinoma in primary biliary cirrhosis may evolve through multiple steps.\r"

  ".W": "A hypothesis has been proposed by this laboratory that endogenous gut-derived lipopolysaccharide is responsible for systemic endotoxemia in animals with acute liver injury particularly after partial (67%) hepatectomy. Systemic lipopolysaccharide and possibly fibrin aggregates or tissue debris then elicit release of cytokines from phagocytizing macrophages and/or monocytes that may be essential for normal liver regeneration. To test this hypothesis liver regeneration was assessed in germ-free euthymic mice that lack the gram-negative bacterial source of lipopolysaccharide, as well as being deficient in lymphoid tissue and relatively resistant to endotoxin. To complement the germ-free animals, conventional athymic nude BALB/c mice and conventional lipopolysaccharide-resistant C3H/HeJ mice were also examined. Liver regeneration, quantified by [3H] thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA after partial hepatectomy was performed on mice anesthetized with ether, was significantly depressed in germ-free euthymic and conventional athymic BALB/c mice and delayed in conventional lipopolysaccharide-resistant C3H/HeJ mice, as compared with conventional control BALB/c and C3H/HeN animals. Pretreatment of conventional euthymic control mice with lipopolysaccharide 24 hr before surgery significantly stimulated hepatic DNA synthesis after 67% liver resection. Germ-free euthymic, conventional athymic, and conventional lipopolysaccharide-resistant mice pretreated with endotoxin did not manifest significant stimulation of liver regeneration. Evidence is reviewed that cytokine release in response to endotoxin was depressed in germ-free euthymic, conventional athymic, and conventional lipopolysaccharide-resistant mice as compared with conventional euthymic controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to determine whether an amino acid solution enriched with branched-chain amino acids altered protein catabolic rates and plasma ammonia in patients with cirrhosis. Nine stable subjects were given two peripheral intravenous infusions: a standard amino acid solution (solution A) and a branched-chain-enriched solution containing 97% more leucine (solution B). Each solution was given for separate 9-day (group 1, n = 6) or 3-day (group 2, n = 3) periods. Amino acid solutions delivered 0.7 gm protein.kg-1.day-1. Diets provided an additional 0.3 gm protein plus maintenance calories. Protein turnover was assessed by a primed continuous infusion of [1-14C] leucine in six patients (three patients in group 1 and three patients in group 2). Nitrogen balance and urinary 3-methyl histidine excretion were determined in group 1 patients. Compared with solution A, solution B increased leucine flux and leucine oxidation but had no significant effect on protein synthesis or catabolism based on the plasma specific activity of either leucine or alpha-ketoisocaproic acid. The additional leucine infused with solution B was quantitatively oxidized. Nitrogen balance did not differ with the two solutions and there was also no difference in the urinary excretion of 3-methyl histidine, suggesting that muscle protein catabolism was unchanged. Plasma ammonia concentration decreased significantly during the infusion of solution B and was associated with a slight fall in plasma glucagon concentration. The results indicated that a branched-chain-enriched amino acid solution did not alter protein synthesis or catabolism although it did lower the plasma ammonia when compared with a standard amino acid formula in stable cirrhotic patients.\r"

In addition, we compared these 21 cases of hepatic vein thrombosis to our 24 cases of hepatic vein thrombosis caused by primary myeloproliferative disorders. In patients with Behcet's disease, a male predominance (male/female ratio, 19:1) contrasted with the female predominance found in patients with hepatic vein thrombosis complicating primary myeloproliferative disorders (sex ratio = 1:3). The mean age at clinical onset was younger in patients with Behcet's disease than in those with primary myeloproliferative disorders (29 vs. 35 yr). Obstruction of the inferior vena cava was found in 90% of patients with hepatic vein thrombosis caused by Behcet's disease. Inferior vena caval thrombosis appears to be the main pathophysiological mechanism of hepatic vein thrombosis in patients with Behcet's disease. Unlike patients with primary myeloproliferative disorders who often had a progressive course, one third of patients with Behcet's disease had acute liver failure and died within 2 wk of clinical onset. These findings suggest that, in patients with Behcet's disease, hepatic vein thrombosis is a sudden event usually related to the extension of a caval thrombus to the ostium of the hepatic veins.\r"

  ".W": "It is now widely recognized that a rigid stepped-care approach to antihypertensive therapy is not universally appropriate. Individualized treatment may result in good or better blood pressure control and a simpler regimen without troublesome side effects. Successful development of such a strategy depends on accurate characterization of a dose-response relation and quantitative assessment of the response in each individual. In the past such relations have proved to be hard to identify for antihypertensive drugs, often because of inappropriate study design during drug development. Despite failure of earlier studies to identify drug concentration-antihypertensive response relations, use of concentration-effect modeling, which recognizes and characterizes the temporal discrepancy between drug concentration and effect, has proved more successful. By using such approach, it has been possible to characterize the concentration-effect relations after acute and steady-state antihypertensive therapy with prazosin, doxazosin, nifedipine, verapamil, and enalapril. With enalapril and nifedipine, it has been demonstrated that the mathematical parameters of effect derived from the first dose can predict the response to these drugs after 4-6 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that the definition of individual concentration-effect relations may be of value in the rational choice of antihypertensive drug therapy and optimization of dose and dose frequency. In particular, the approach can provide valuable information on dose-effect relations and should optimize choice of dose intervals in drug development and practice.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of specific active immunization against renin were compared with those of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were immunized (SHR-I) (n = 10) against pure murine renin (four injections of 30 micrograms/kg s.c.) or received (SHR-P) (n = 11) a converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg/day per os for 4 weeks). Sham-immunized SHR (SHR-S) (n = 12) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY-S) (n = 12) rats served as controls. At 15 weeks of age, 24-hour average blood pressure was obtained in freely moving rats using intra-aortic pressure recording with computer analysis. Antirenin immunization induced high circulating titers of antibodies, a fall in plasma renin activity (-95%), and urinary excretion of mineralocorticoids. Perindopril abolished the pressor response to angiotensin I, whereas plasma ACE was only partly (-56%) decreased. It also increased plasma renin activity and did not alter the urinary excretion of steroids. Both immunization and perindopril allowed the blood pressure of SHR to return to the level of WKY-S rats and reduced the left ventricular weight. These decreases were associated with an elevated sympathetic nervous system activity as indicated by increases in the urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. It is conclude that, apart from an unaltered steroid synthesis, most of the cardiovascular effects of chronic ACE inhibition are similar to those of antirenin immunization, thus indicating that blockade of the circulating and renal renin-angiotensin system accounts for most of the effects of ACE inhibitors.\r"

We measured C3a (complement activation), platelets and beta-thromboglobulin (platelet activation), thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and fibrinopeptide A (coagulation activation), using C-Reactive Protein as a control for dilution effects. As previously shown, activation of complement was more important with CA than with AN 69 (p less than 0.01). In contrast, activation of coagulation (increase in fibrinopeptide A and thrombin-antithrombin III complexes) was more pronounced with AN 69 than with CA. This study emphasizes the need to consider different biological systems when the bioincompatibility of a hemodialysis membrane is evaluated.\r"

Multiple abnormalities were noted in thirty-four (25 per cent) of the wrists. The clinical signs and symptoms in the eighty-six wrists did not always correlate with the defects that were seen on the arthrograms. Three of five patients who had an isolated tear of the scapholunate ligament, six of thirteen who had an isolated tear of the lunotriquetral ligament, and seven of nineteen who had an isolated tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex also had signs and symptoms on the opposite side of the wrist. Many of the lesions that were seen on arthrography may have been serendipitous, degenerative, or unrelated to a specific injury. There was a high prevalence of positive ulnar variance in patients who had at least one ulnar abnormality. Capsular tears, most often seen on the radiovolar aspect of the wrist, were best outlined by contrast medium injected into the radiocarpal joint. The arthroscopic findings differed from the arthrographic findings in five of the twenty patients in whom both studies were done. The three-compartment technique of injection is a valuable diagnostic tool. Injections of contrast medium into the distal radio-ulnar joint outlined five of thirteen tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex that were not seen after injection into the radiocarpal joint. Of the eleven tears that were seen after injection into the radiocarpal joint, five were not seen when contrast medium was injected into the distal radio-ulnar joint.\r"

It has been hypothesized that the stress that is applied to the tendon as it passes under the medial malleolus may compromise the vascularity of the tendon in this area, a process that is similar to that described for the supraspinatus tendon. In order to evaluate this possibility, we studied the vascularity of the posterior tibial tendon. We injected twenty-eight cadaveric limbs with an India ink-gelatin mixture and cleared them using a modified Spalteholz technique. The gross external and internal vascularity were drawn, and the specimens were photographed. The vascularity of the tendons was noted to be abundant at the osseous insertion and the musculotendinous function of the tendon. There was a zone of hypovascularity posterior and distal to the medial malleolus in all specimens. The results of this study suggest that relative avascularity and resulting degenerative changes may be predisposing factors in rupture of the posterior tibial tendon, and that they have important implications in terms of the operative management of the rupture.\r"

An associated connective-tissue disorder involving elastin accounts for the most frequent musculoskeletal manifestations, which include severe flexible flat feet, excessive laxity of the joints, and scoliosis. At our institution, seventy-five (50 per cent) of the 150 male patients who had fragile-X syndrome had flat feet, eighty-five (57 per cent) had excessive laxity of the joints, and ten had scoliosis. Twenty-nine of the patients who had flat feet had been evaluated or treated, or both, by an orthopaedic surgeon before the diagnosis of fragile-X syndrome had been made. Only one of these patients had been referred for developmental and genetic evaluation, which suggests that the orthopaedic community is not familiar with this syndrome. The orthopaedist should consider the diagnosis of fragile-X syndrome in the evaluation of a mentally retarded boy or man who has a family history of mental retardation. The presence of flat feet and excessive laxity of the joints, associated with the characteristic facies, macro-orchidism, and behavior, justifies a referral for developmental and genetic evaluation. Early diagnosis is important for several reasons, including genetic counseling for the family, more efficacious medical treatment, and specialized education.\r"

Group I (double latex gloves) had a significantly higher rate of total inner-glove perforations per procedure (p less than 0.0001) than Group II (cloth and latex gloves). Furthermore, unrecognized perforations were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (p less than 0.01). In Group I, the number of punctures increased with the duration of the operation; a puncture was found in all procedures in which the operation lasted longer than three hours (p less than 0.01). In Group II, only two tears of the inner glove occurred. Both were unrecognized and were independent of the duration of the operation.\r"

Northern blot analysis demonstrated the coexpression of the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene and the PDGF-R gene in all astrocytomas examined. The majority of the tumors also expressed the PDGF-1 gene. There was no correlation between the expression of the two PDGF genes. Nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed the PDGF-R and PDGF-1 genes but not the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene. In situ hybridization of astrocytoma tissue localized the expression of the c-sis and PDGF-R mRNA's in tumor cells. Capillary endothelial cells also expressed c-sis mRNA. In contrast, nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed only PDGF-R mRNA but not c-sis/PDGF-2 mRNA. The coexpression of a potent mitogenic growth factor protooncogene (c-sis) and its receptor gene in astrocytoma tumor cells suggests the presence of an autocrine mechanism that may contribute to the development and maintenance of astrocytomas. The expression of c-sis mRNA in tumor cells but not in nonmalignant brain cells may serve as an additional diagnostic criterion for the detection of astrocytomas in small tissue specimen using in situ hybridization for the detection of c-sis mRNA and/or immunostaining for the recognition of its protein product.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictive peptide initially characterized as a product of endothelial cells. To examine the potential role of endothelin as a neuropeptide, we studied its distribution in the human central nervous system. RNA blot hybridization provided evidence of endothelin gene transcription in a variety of functional regions of the brain. In situ hybridization confirmed the widespread pattern of endothelin transcription and indicated that the highest density of cells containing endothelin mRNA is in the hypothalamus. This technique localized endothelin transcription to cells of the nervous system as well as the vascular endothelium. Immunocytochemical studies detected endothelin immunoreactivity in neurons, providing evidence of the synthesis of the peptide in this cell type and confirming that endothelin is a neuropeptide. Although the prominent expression of endothelin in the hypothalamus may indicate a central vasoregulatory role for the peptide, the widespread distribution of endothelin in neurons in other areas of the brain implies a more fundamental role in the regulation of nervous system function.\r"

Incubation of microvessels with either vehicle (control; C) or 10(-5) M forskolin (F) in media resulted in an increase in microvessel cAMP (0.67 +/- 0.13 vs. 22 +/- 4.6 pmol/min per mg protein) (P less than 0.005) and renin released into the culture media (1,026 +/- 98 vs. 1,552 +/- 159 pg angiotensin I/h per mg protein) (P = 0.008) (C vs. F). Renin mRNA levels in the newborn kidney microvessels increased 1.6-fold with forskolin treatment. Renin release by isolated, single microvascular cells (with or without forskolin) was assessed using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Forskolin administration resulted in an increase in the number of renin-secreting cells without changes in the amount of renin secreted by individual cells. In conclusion, newborn kidney microvessels and isolated renin-releasing microvascular cells possess a functionally active adenylate cyclase whose short-term stimulation results in accumulation of cAMP, a significant increase in renin release, and an enhancement of renin gene expression. The increase in renin release is due to recruitment of microvascular cells secreting renin. Recruitment of hormone-secreting cells in response to stimuli may prove to be a mechanism of general biological importance shared by many endocrine cell types.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypercholesterolemia on vascular function was studied in humans. To eliminate the potential confounding effects of atherosclerosis, vascular reactivity was measured in the forearm resistance vessels of 11 normal subjects (serum LDL cholesterol = 111 +/- 7 mg/dl) and 13 patients with hypercholesterolemia (serum LDL cholesterol = 211 +/- 19 mg/dl, P less than 0.05). Each subject received intrabrachial artery infusions of methacholine, which releases endothelium-derived relaxant factor, and nitroprusside which directly stimulates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle. Maximal vasodilatory potential was determined during reactive hyperemia. Vasoconstrictive responsiveness was examined during intra-arterial phenylephrine infusion. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Basal forearm blood flow in normal and hypercholesterolemic subjects was comparable. Similarly, reactive hyperemic blood flow did not differ between the two groups. In contrast, the maximal forearm blood flow response to methacholine in hypercholesterolemic subjects was less than that observed in normal subjects. In addition, the forearm blood flow response to nitroprusside was less in hypercholesterolemic subjects. There was no difference in the forearm vasoconstrictive response to phenylephrine in the two groups. Thus, the vasodilator responses to methacholine and nitroprusside were blunted in patients with hypercholesterolemia. We conclude that in humans with hypercholesterolemia, there is a decreased effect of nitrovasodilators, including endothelium-derived relaxing factor, on the vascular smooth muscle of resistance vessels.\r"

It might be studied in experimental diabetes to characterize it, elucidate its mechanisms, and determine whether it can be prevented or treated. The pilocarpine-induced sweat responses (SR) in the hind foot pads of groups of control and streptozocin diabetic rats, in good (GC) and in poor (PC) glycemic control and with a crossover design after 20 wk of diabetes, were evaluated with the silicone mold sweat test to determine the number of sweat droplets per group of foot pads. The SR was dose dependent and reproducible. The SR disappeared with denervation and reappeared with reinnervation; denervation hypersensitivity did not develop. In the GC group, euglycemia was achieved by regulating the caloric intake and using multiple daily injections of Ultralente insulin. The SR was not different from that of the control group for up to 136 d. In the PC group, the SR became abnormal (P less than 0.005) at 16 d and progressively worsened: 40% of baseline values at 14 wk (P less than 0.001). After restoring euglycemia in the PC group, a normal SR occurred at 12 d. These results show that one human neuropathic deficit, failure of sweating, can be prevented or ameliorated by good glycemic control.\r"

  ".W": "Prednisone treatment causes protein wasting and adds additional risks to a patient, whereas human growth hormone (hGH) treatment causes positive nitrogen balance. To determine whether concomitant administration of hGH prevents the protein catabolic effects of prednisone, four groups of eight healthy volunteers each were studied using isotope dilution and nitrogen balance techniques after 7 d of placebo, hGH alone (0.1 mg.kg-1.d-1), prednisone alone (0.8 mg.kg-1.d-1), or prednisone plus hGH (n = 8 in each group). Whether protein balance was calculated from the leucine kinetic data or nitrogen balance values, prednisone alone induced protein wasting (P less than 0.001), whereas hGH alone resulted in positive (P less than 0.001) protein balance, when compared to the placebo-treated subjects. When hGH was added to prednisone therapy, the glucocorticoid-induced protein catabolism was prevented. Using leucine kinetic data, negative protein balance during prednisone was due to increased (P less than 0.05) proteolysis, whereas hGH had no effect on proteolysis and increased (P less than 0.01) whole body protein synthesis. During combined treatment, estimates of proteolysis and protein synthesis were similar to those observed in the placebo treated control group. In conclusion, human growth hormone may have a distinct role in preventing the protein losses associated with the administration of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticosteroids in humans.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to a well-documented depletion of CD4+ T helper cells in later stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, evidence has been provided for a specific unresponsiveness to triggering either by specific antigen in the context of autologous major histocompatibility molecules (self + X) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) in both CD4 and CD8 cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. In the present study we analyzed this unresponsiveness using mitogenic antibodies to distinct T cell membrane receptors. T cells from HIV-infected men who had normal numbers of CD4+ T cells responded poorly to activation signals via the CD3 membrane antigen in both accessory cell-dependent as well as accessory cell-independent culture systems. A similar low response was observed in an anti-CD2-driven system. In contrast, proliferation induced by anti-CD3, anti-CD2, or the phorbol ester Phorbol myristate acetate could be normally enhanced by anti-CD28 MAb. We demonstrated that this unresponsiveness is not due to a failure to induce early events required for activation, such as increased intracellular concentration of free calcium and activation of protein kinase C, but is caused by an imbalance between naive and memory T cells. In HIV-infected asymptomatic men, CD29+ memory T cells are selectively depleted which results in a poor responsiveness to self + X. These findings provide new insights that may have implications for our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "90307987\r", 
  ".W": "The p53 gene initially was thought to be an oncogene, but recent evidence suggests that wild-type p53 can function as a tumor suppressor gene in lung, colon, and breast cancer as well as less common malignancies. This study reports the first identification of intronic point mutations as a mechanism for inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Abnormally sized p53 mRNAs found in a small cell and a non-small cell lung cancer cell line were characterized by sequence analysis of cDNA/PCR products, the RNase protection assay and immunoprecipitation. These mRNAs were found to represent aberrant splicing leading to the production of abnormal or no p53 protein. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA revealed that a point mutation at the splice acceptor site in the third intron or the splice donor site in the seventh intron accounts for the abnormal mRNA splicing. In one patient the same intronic point mutation was found in the tumor cell line derived from a bone marrow metastasis and in multiple liver metastases but not in normal DNA, indicating that it occurred as a somatic event before the development of these metastases. These findings further support the role of inactivation of the p53 gene in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and indicate the role of intronic point mutation in this process.\r"

Are components degraded and inserted along the length of the crypt-villus axis or selectively in the crypt region with subsequent migration of basement membrane from crypt to villus tip in concert with epithelium? We injected affinity-purified sheep anti-laminin IgG or sheep anti-laminin IgG complexed to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into mice to label basement membrane laminin in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy revealed linear fluorescence along the length of the jejunal epithelial basement membrane 1 d after anti-laminin IgG injection. By 1 wk, small nonfluorescent domains were interposed between larger fluorescent domains. Over the next 5 wk the lengths of nonfluorescent domains increased progressively whereas those of fluorescent domains decreased. Additionally, electron microscopy revealed HRP reaction product along the length of the epithelial basement membrane after 1 d whereas unlabeled or lightly labeled domains that increased in length with time were observed interposed between heavily labeled domains by 2 and 4 wk along the entire crypt-villus axis. We conclude that laminin turnover occurs focally in the epithelial basement membrane of mouse jejunum along the crypt-villus axis over a period of weeks and that this basement membrane does not comigrate in concert with its overlying epithelium.\r"

Edgar Hoover. Although fingerprints have been noted and used since antiquity, a 25-year burst of activity that secured adoption of their use for identification began in about 1880. New modifications and applications have continued to the present. The history of fingerprints offers an excellent example of how society adopts innovations. This story also includes a bitter struggle for appropriate credit for various crucial steps in developing and adopting this important tool. More recent technical advances, including computers and molecular biology, now supplement the ease and usefulness of fingerprints, although the word fingerprinting continues in use by metaphoric extension.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen patients (six women and 11 men) with Jessner's lymphocytic infiltration of the skin were studied. Nineteen biopsy specimens were analyzed with the following monoclonal antibodies: UCHL1 (T cells), 4KB5, L26 (B cells), LN1 (germinal center B cells), and BerH2 (Ki-1+ cells). Routine direct immunofluorescence was performed on 15 specimens. In 10 of 19 specimens both B and T cells were demonstrated; the B cells were in close proximity to small blood vessels. In 50% of these cases the B cell component expressed LN1 positivity. We use the term perivascular lymphocytoma to describe this pattern. Nine specimens showed T cells only. No Ki-1+ cells were detected. Routine immunofluorescence studies were performed on 15 specimens. In six of seven specimens in which there was a mixed cell population of B and T cells, results were completely negative. In contrast, six of the remaining eight specimens with a predominantly T cell population revealed weak, patchy, granular, positive labeling for immunocomponents, particularly IgM and C3 at the basement membrane. These findings suggest that Jessner's lymphocytic infiltration is a heterogeneous disorder with at least two separate immunophenotypes. The finding of perivascular follicular center differentiation in more than half the specimens suggests a possible relationship in these cases to other benign lymphoid hyperplasias (pseudolymphomas).\r"

The present study compared the perception of and preference for salt in persons 65 years and over and in persons aged 20 to 35 years. The subjects were free-living, had not been hospitalized in the past 12 months, and had never been on a sodium-restricted diet. Salt was introduced in suprathreshold concentrations of 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 0.9% in mashed potatoes and chicken broth. The 48 older adults in our study demonstrated higher preferences for the four salt concentrations in the potatoes (p = .0001) and the broth (p = .0004) than did the 53 younger adults. There were no significant differences in the two age groups' abilities to perceive the saltiness of the four concentrations. There were also no significant differences in salt perception among subgroups identified for age, gender, smoking behavior, and denture use. Both groups correctly ranked the concentrations in ascending order. Our study found that taste acuity for salt in older subjects was not different from that of younger adults when suprathreshold concentrations of salt in mashed potatoes and chicken broth were used as stimuli.\r"

Financial and personnel resources are limited, and foodservice managers are faced with the increasingly difficult task of efficiently and effectively meeting consumer demands. A wide variety of labor productivity measures have been reported in the foodservice literature. The most prevalent of those measures include labor minutes per meal and labor minutes per meal equivalent. A measurement technique that considers only one or a few of the resources used to produce goods and services may result in limitations and potentially inaccurate productivity measurement. A total-factor productivity model that relates organizational output to all input resources is recommended. Such a model has been used in several business firms. Aggregate and multiple partial-factor productivity ratios enabled business managers to identify the relationships and trade-offs among all resources not previously revealed in labor productivity measures. Such an expanded productivity model could be applied in food-service settings to provide additional information for enhanced decision making.\r"

In a double-blind, repeated measures, cross-over design, patients had three nights of treatment with placebo, 0.125 mg of triazolam, or 0.25 mg of triazolam following an adaptation night. Although total leg movements were not changed, the medication increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency while decreasing the number of stage changes. Generally, daytime performance and objective alertness were significantly improved following the use of triazolam. It was concluded that acute use of triazolam, particularly the 0.125 mg dose, could improve sleep and daytime function in older patients with periodic leg movements, fragmented sleep, and daytime sleepiness.\r"

The main theme of this review is that, in the future, studies of aging must better attempt to capture the interplay between disease and aging processes. A variety of research results, mostly from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, are used to support this argument. Topics covered include: the role of longitudinal studies in aging research; the complexity of the aging process; the significance of cohort and secular changes for understanding both aging and disease processes; age changes over the adult life span in the significance of risk factors for disease; and age-related increases in morbidity in a longevous group of men.\r"

Three hypotheses were tested with subjects ranging in age from 20 to 72 years of age: (1) blood pressure values predict neuropsychological test performance over a wide range of hypertensive and normotensive blood pressure values; (2) blood pressure predicts performance within the narrower range of normal and borderline values; (3) blood pressure X age interactions, when observed over this age and education range, are such that negative blood pressure effects on performance are larger for younger than older subjects. Regression analyses confirmed each of these hypotheses and indicated that strength of prediction was not reduced when participants free from hypertension-related complications and medication were tested. Blood pressure X age interactions were seen for Trailmaking-B Test and the Tactile Performance Test-Localization for the primary sample. However, only Blood Pressure main effects were observed for the Average Impairment Rating, the Categories Test, TPT-Memory and TPT-Localization when age, sex, and education were controlled. Implications of these findings for the role of blood pressure in aging research and for longitudinal studies with subjects free from the need for treatment with antihypertensive medications are discussed.\r"

First, the ability of aspartyl and thiol proteases to generate antigenic fragments of Ova in vitro was determined. It was found that cathepsin D, an aspartyl protease, digested OVA to fragments that could be recognized by Th cells without further processing by APC. Cathepsin B, a thiol protease, was unable to generate antigenic fragments of OVA in vitro. These results provide evidence that APC do not require thiol protease activity for processing OVA. In contrast, APC were unable to present OVA to Th cells when thiol protease inhibitors were added to the incubation. Taken together, these observations indicate that thiol proteases may be important, not for processing, OVA, but for presentation of processed fragments by APC. This conclusion is supported by evidence obtained from experiments in which APC were treated with thiol protease inhibitors before addition of the antigenic peptide, OVA323-339. Under these conditions, the capacity of I-Ad at the cell surface to present OVA323-339 to Th cells was reduced. The results of these experiments provide evidence that Ag presentation of OVA may be achieved through the action of two different classes of proteases: aspartyl proteases such as cathepsin D, which process OVA to antigenic fragments, and thiol proteases such as cathepsin B, which are important for expression of functional MHC II molecules by APC.\r"

CKS-17 coupled to a carrier protein, BSA or human serum albumin, inhibited the generation of anti-allo CTL in a dose-dependent manner. Controls consisting of BSA and human serum albumin, which had undergone the coupling procedure or neurotensin, an unrelated peptide, coupled to BSA in an identical manner as CKS-17 showed no such inhibitory action. The suppression was not restricted to the Ag specificity of the CTL activity. CKS-17 exerted inhibitory effects on the early afferent phase of CTL induction. Kinetic studies showed that the suppressive activity occurred when CKS-17 was introduced to the immunologically stimulating culture concomitant with or up to 48 h after initiation of culture. Analysis of the frequency of CTL precursor cells using limiting-dilution assays revealed that CKS-17 did act to reduce the number of precursor cells. Abrogation of the inhibition of CTL activity was observed when IL-2 was introduced to the culture together with the stimulator cells. Other lymphokines, such as IL-4, exerted a similar influence to counteract this suppression.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of monocytes with cultured large vessel venous and arterial endothelial cells (EC) and with cultured microvascular EC was studied. Analysis of time-lapse microcinematographic video recordings showed that monocytes adhere rapidly to the surface of EC and subsequently remain spherical and fixed to the initial site of adherence. Some monocytes adherent to EC stretch out within 30 to 90 min and migrate over the EC surface or become stretched for about 10 to 30 min and then detach from the EC surface and move rapidly over the EC monolayer. It was shown that the interaction of monocytes with EC is dynamic, that the morphology of monocytes adherent to EC changes constantly, and that stretching of the monocytes over the surface of the EC is not an inevitable and irreversible consequence of binding. A quantitative adherence assay was developed in which both the morphology and the number of monocytes bound to EC were determined. For each type of EC the number of monocytes bound to a single EC was found to be linearly related to the number of monocytes added and was lower for smaller EC. The adherence of monocytes to venous and arterial EC followed a different time course than the adherence to capillary EC and adherence to both types of macrovascular EC was higher than adherence to microvascular EC was higher than adherence to microvascular EC. The percentage of adherent monocytes with a stretched morphology was lower when these cells were adherent to capillary EC than to both types of macrovascular EC and increased upon addition of serum. Adherence of monocytes to venous, arterial, and capillary EC was partially inhibited by mAb directed against the alpha-chain of lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 or C3bi receptor (with mAb LM2/1, but not with mAb OKM1) and by mAb against the common beta-chain of the three leukocyte adhesion molecules. The degree of inhibition of monocyte adherence to EC by mAb against lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 alpha and the common beta-chain was dependent on the type of EC and was higher for venous EC (57 to 70% inhibition) than for arterial (40 to 44% inhibition) and capillary (44 to 49% inhibition) EC. Inhibition of monocyte adherence obtained with anti-C3bi receptor-alpha mAb was similar for each EC type. mAb against p150, 95 did not affect adherence. None of the mAb could block binding completely; combinations of the mAb also did not result in increased inhibition of monocyte adherence to EC.\r"

In a search for a cell source for the urinary IL-1 inhibitor, we tested three promyelocytic cell lines, H-161, AML-193, and HL-60, for their ability to produce this protein. Under normal culture conditions none of these cell lines produce detectable IL-1 inhibitory activity. The H-161 cells were treated with differentiation-inducing agents, i.e., sodium butyrate, hemin, retinoic acid, DMSO, vitamin D3, and PMA alone or in combination with IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, granulocyte-CSF, macrophage-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and Con A and tested for the production of IL-1 inhibitor. Production of IL-1 inhibitor was detected in cell supernatant, when H-161 cells were differentiated to adherent macrophage-like cells under the influence of PMA followed by a second signal provided by GM-CSF. Treatment of the other two cell lines, AML-193 and HL-60, with PMA plus GM-CSF also yielded similar IL-1 inhibitor protein. Partial purified H-161-derived IL-1 inhibitor showed specific binding to IL-1R-bearing cells and blocked the binding of IL-1 to its receptor and is thus similar to the urinary-derived molecule. We conclude the GM-CSF provides a signal to adherent macrophage-like cells to become \"inhibitory macrophages\" and to produce a competitive inhibitor of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human monocytes undergo a process of differentiation and maturation lasting 5 to 10 days that ultimately leads to the appearance of large macrophage-like cells. This differentiation is growth factor dependent: of all the cytokines tested, only macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and IL-3 proved capable of supporting the differentiation and the long term survival of the macrophage-like cells. Although all three cytokines yield cells with macrophage characteristics, cells developed in M-CSF have features distinct from those matured in either IL-3 or GM-CSF. At the morphologic level, the M-CSF-supported monocyte cultures yield elongated, spindle-shaped cells whereas those supported with IL-3 or GM-CSF yielded round cells with distinct nuclei. All three macrophage populations expressed similar levels of HLA-DR, CD11b, and CD11c, but the M-CSF-treated cultures yielded more CD14+ and CD16+ (Fc gamma RIII) cells. All three cell populations developed capacity for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as well as antibody-independent cytotoxicity with peak activity achieved after 8 to 12 days in culture. ADCC capacity developed earliest and the level of activity was usually greatest in the M-CSF-treated cultures, possibly correlating with the higher level of expression of CD16. Our findings indicate that any of these cytokines, but particularly M-CSF, may be useful clinically in enhancing the tumoricidal capacity of tumor-specific mAb through augmentation of macrophage capacity for ADCC.\r"

To gain insight into the pathogenesis and diversity of this antibody response we have used recombinant DNA technology to map the linear B cell epitopes on p70. A full length 1.7-kb cDNA clone encoding p70 was isolated from a human placental library and restriction fragments or polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments of the gene subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX. Purified fusion proteins representing specific regions of p70 were immunoblotted with a panel of 70 anti-(U1)RNP+ sera containing anti-p70 antibodies. Six epitopes, four major (A, B, C, and F) and two minor (D and E) were mapped and were located throughout the molecule. The anti-(U1)RNP sera displayed heterogeneity in their pattern of reactivity to the six epitopes although reactivity to epitope C was more frequently associated with SLE rather than mixed connective tissue disease. The identification of multiple B cell epitopes on p70 is consistent with the concept that this self Ag drives the autoantibody response.\r"

  ".U": "90308309\r", 
  ".W": "A variety of monocyte/neutrophil adhesive functions is coordinated by the CD11b/CD18 complex, a leukocyte-restricted member of integrin receptors. Previous studies have shown that the adenine nucleotide ADP produces a transient and high affinity recognition state of CD11b/CD18 for its complementary ligands fibrinogen and factor X. We have now characterized the process of intracellular signalling initiated in monocytes by ADP. Further, we have causally related these events to the qualitative upregulation of CD11b/CD18, as exemplified by its inducible binding of factor X. Micromolar concentrations of ADP or ATP produce dose-dependent increase in monocyte cytosolic free [Ca2+]i through mobilization from intracellular stores coupled with a sustained, EGTA-sensitive, influx of Ca2+ from the external compartment. This Ca2+ response was kinetically and quantitatively heterogeneous when analyzed at the single cell level. Ca2+ channel antagonists nifedipine or verapamil blocked the sustained phase of ADP-induced Ca2+ entry and inhibited 125I-factor X binding to CD11b/CD18 in a dose-dependent manner. Nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels are gated by variations in transmembrane potential in a variety of cells. In monocytes, depolarizing conditions by high external [K+] or by the Na+ ionophore gramicidin D mimicked the stimulatory effect of ADP, inducing increased cytosolic free [Ca2+]i and 125I-factor X binding to CD11b/CD18. In contrast, these responses were both abrogated by hyperpolarization with the K+ ionophore valinomycin. These data suggest that a sustained increase in monocyte cytosolic free [Ca2+]i coupled with variations in transmembrane potential regulate the high affinity receptor function of CD11b/CD18. Although prototypically exemplified for monocyte stimulation with adenine nucleotides, this pathway of intracellular signalling might provide a general mechanism for transient and qualitative functional upregulation of integrin receptors.\r"

  ".U": "90308314\r", 
  ".W": "Macrophage C3 receptors are normally immobilized in the plane of the cells' plasma membrane and are unable to promote phagocytosis even though they promote avid particle binding. We have previously identified a lymphokine that activates macrophage C3 receptors for phagocytosis both in vitro and in vivo, and others have found that certain types of nonimmunologically mediated inflammation are also able to activate mononuclear phagocyte C3 receptors. These findings raised the possibility that macrophage C3 receptor activation is a universal consequence of inflammation. We sought in the present experiments to determine whether or not inflammation induced by microbial infection in a nonimmune host resulted in activation of macrophage C3 receptors. We injected mice i.p. with either viable microorganisms, microbe-containing immune complexes, or bacterial LPS. Macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage 4 days later; nearly all lavage fluids grew the microorganism with which the mouse had been injected, indicating that an infection had been established. Monolayers of macrophages were established and their interaction with sheep E coated with C3 (EIgMC) was determined. All macrophages bound EIgMC, but only macrophages from mice injected with either very high concentrations of LPS or microbe-containing immune complexes ingested them. C3 receptors of macrophages that ingested EIgMC were mobile; others were not. Thus, inflammation induced by microbial infection does not commonly, if at all, activate macrophage C3 receptors; microbe-containing immune complexes and high concentrations of LPS do. The mechanism of receptor activation in each case is C3 receptor mobilization, which is probably mediated by a lymphokine.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibility of bacteria-infected fibroblasts to the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor was investigated. L cells infected with Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, or Listeria monocytogenes, had an enhanced susceptibility to the cytotoxic activity of TNF-alpha. This enhanced susceptibility was dependent upon the challenge dose of bacteria, the concentration of TNF, and upon the exposure time of bacteria-infected cells to TNF. L cells infected with S. flexneri were susceptible to the cytotoxic action of TNF at 2 to 6 h after bacterial infection. In contrast, L cells infected with S. typhimurium or L. monocytogenes did not show enhanced susceptibility to TNF until 14 h postbacterial infection and exposure to TNF. Enhanced susceptibility to TNF was dependent on bacterial invasion because fibroblasts pretreated with a noninvasive isogenic variant of S. flexneri, UV-treated invasive bacteria, bacterial cultural supernatant, or bacteria LPS were no more susceptible to TNF than untreated cells. Enhanced susceptibility to TNF by bacteria-infected cells was not unique to L cells. Mouse embryo fibroblasts and HeLa cells also showed similar reactivities after bacteria infection. Bacteria-infected cells were greatly suppressed in host cell protein synthesis that may play an important role in their enhanced susceptibility to TNF. These results suggest that an important role of TNF in host defense against bacterial infections is its cytotoxic activity against bacteria-infected cells.\r"

As shown by experiments in which B cells are polyclonally stimulated with anti-Ig antibody, this includes an early increase in c-myc gene expression. In our study a correlation between increases in the rate of gene transcription and the level of c-myc mRNA was observed both with the brief increase in c-myc expression that is induced by anti-Ig, as well as with the more intense and prolonged expression of c-myc that follows treatment with anti-Ig plus the cytoskeleton perturbing agent, cytochalasin. Elevation of the rate of initiation was detected with both stimulatory regimens although the combination of anti-Ig plus cytochalasin increased the rate of elongation in addition to the rate of initiation. These results suggest that stimulation of B lymphocytes alters expression of trans-acting factors that regulate transcription of the c-myc gene.\r"

The end product has been examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of thin sections, light microscopy, and lipid analysis using thin-layer chromatography. Light microscopic observation of hematoxylin-eosin stained, paraffin embedded cross-sections of the cell culture revealed a strong resemblance to its intact human counterpart, especially with respect to the morphologic organization in basal, spinous, granular, and horny layers. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy and TEM of thin sections generally confirmed the observed resemblances and additionally suggested the presence of lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum, and of lamellar (lipid) structures between the corneocytes. However, some imperfections were also observed, including some anomalous lipid structures in the intercellular space. Lipid analyses in conjunction with essential fatty acid enrichment studies suggested that the structural anomalies observed in the cultured system may be caused by a lack of linoleyl-ceramides resulting from \"immobilization\" of linoleyl moieties in the form of triglycerides and phospholipids. In its present form, the air-exposed cell culture already looks very promising as a model for studies of, e.g., skin differentiation disorders such as psoriasis or ichthyosis, studies of the percutaneous penetration and intra(epi)dermal biotransformation of drugs, and skin toxicity screenings. It is furthermore expected that the aforementioned imperfections in the air-exposed cell culture should be avoidable by changing culture conditions such as the relative humidity and the pH, the composition of the medium, or both.\r"

We found that the neo-dermis contained most of the major connective tissue elements early in the post-transplantation period. However, regardless of the time examined, there was a paucity of elastin fibers and poor organization of linkin (microthread-like fibers) in the neo-dermis beneath autografts. The perturbations of these connective tissue components in the neo-dermis may play a role in the poor recoil and elastic properties of burn wounds treated with autografts.\r"

Previous measurements of TGF-alpha in the urine were limited by the large volumes of urine required for detection. Sensitive assays are required to detect TGF-alpha in small urine samples from individual patients with melanoma. An assay which detects ng quantities of immunoreactive TGF-alpha in 10 ml of urine using dialysis, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and Western blot of the HPLC fractions was used to study the urine from 6 melanoma patients and 6 normal human volunteers. No TGF-alpha was detectable in the first voided urine specimens from the normal volunteers. In contrast, TGF-alpha was detected in the urine specimens of two of three patients with primary melanomas and two of three patients with metastatic melanoma. The sensitivity and reliability of the assay were most affected by methods of urine collection, sample preparation, and storage. TGF-alpha was less often found in randomly voided urine samples from melanoma patients (1 of 3 detectable) as compared to first voided morning urine samples (3 of 3 detectable). This data indicates urinary TGF-alpha assay may be useful in the diagnosis and management of patients with melanoma.\r"

In the present study, we show that both IL-1 alpha and beta immunoreactivities can be detected in all epidermal cell layers, provided optimal processing of tissue samples is used. The use of isolated epidermal cells showed that keratinocytes at various stages of maturation display both membrane-associated and cytosolic IL-1 alpha and beta immunoreactivities. After protease treatment of tissue sections, the IL-1 beta immunoreactivity of the granular cell layer was enhanced by some antibodies used, whereas in the other cell layers it was clearly lower. We a) suggest a different cellular localization, processing, and/or binding to subcellular structures of IL-1 during the differentiation process of human keratinocytes and b) outline the technical difficulties in any immunohistologic approach to IL-1 status in diseased skin.\r"

Flow cytometry showed that a population of surface GPIb-negative platelets was evident at 5 days and increased three- to fivefold by the tenth day. Tritium radiolabeling of surface GPIb showed a decrease over 10 days of 37% +/- 17%. The degree of loss of surface GPIb correlated well with other changes during storage: decreased ristocetin-induced agglutination, decreased responsiveness in the hypotonic shock test, lower plasma pH, and increased extracellular lactic dehydrogenase. Immunoblotting of total platelet GPIb with the SZ-2 antibody showed a decrease of 58% +/- 16% during the 10-day storage period. The effect of protease inhibitors or platelet activation inhibitors on the loss of GPIb during storage was studied in platelet concentrates paired with untreated controls. Only the platelet activation inhibitors prostaglandin E1 and theophylline retarded the loss of surface GPIb levels (93% +/- 5% GPIb remaining vs 65% +/- 16%). Total GPIb levels also decreased less in the presence of the activation inhibitors (45% +/- 22% lost vs 70% +/- 14% lost). These findings suggest that platelet activation, rather than plasma enzymatic activity, is responsible for the loss of platelet GPIb during storage of platelet concentrates.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify a mechanism of insulin resistance associated with myotonic dystrophy, we studied the insulin receptor by using three different types of cells--circulating erythrocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts, and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-transformed lymphocytes. In myotonic dystrophy, insulin binding to erythrocytes and fibroblasts was significantly decreased as a result of a reduction of the binding affinity. Insulin binding to EBV-transformed lymphocytes was normal. When the receptors were purified from fibroblasts with wheat germ agglutinin, we could not find a decrease in the binding affinity seen in the intact cells. No difference was observed in the magnitude of basal and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptors from EBV-transformed lymphocytes between the control and myotonic dystrophy. Southern blot analysis of the insulin receptor gene revealed no restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with myotonic dystrophy. These findings suggest that there is no primary defect of the insulin receptor per se in terms of insulin binding and autophosphorylation in myotonic dystrophy. The reduction of the insulin binding to erythrocytes and fibroblasts may be caused by the plasma membrane abnormality that affects the binding affinity of the receptor.\r"

Insulin resistance precedes development of overt diabetes, and some insulin bioeffects are known to be impaired at the postreceptor level in several target tissues of this rat model. We studied a possible contribution of altered insulin receptor function to the impaired insulin action in these animals. Activity of the insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase of receptors from kidney cortical basolateral membranes (BLMs) obtained from these nonobese, normoinsulinemic, insulin-resistant rats was examined at the age of 5 weeks (before overt hyperglycemia developed) and at 10 weeks (after NIDDM was fully manifested). In experimental animals, at both 5 and 10 weeks, binding of insulin labeled with iodine 125 to crude kidney BLM was higher than in their control littermates. However, no such difference was found with insulin binding to purified insulin receptors from BLM. The insulin receptor, tyrosine kinase activity (TKA), to an exogenous substrate was higher in diabetic tissue both at basal condition and after insulin stimulation at both 5 and 10 weeks of age. Autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor and the proportion of tyrosine-phosphorylated (\"active\") insulin receptors from BLM was also higher in diabetic rats. There was an age-related increase in the receptor TKA between 5 and 10 weeks in both diabetic and control animals. A 24-hour fast normalized insulin binding and nearly abolished the difference in TKA of the BLM receptors from 5-week-old insulin-resistant rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Timing of the operation is crucial: intervening too early can produce an additional strain on the patient and an increased risk, while waiting too long to evacuate the hematoma can be fatal. This dilemma may be a factor in the relatively high mortality and morbidity rates following both operative and conservative treatment that have been reported in the literature (42.5% and 30%, respectively). In long-term studies on 14 patients, the authors have shown that stereotactic puncture and fibrinolysis for cerebellar hemorrhage is a valuable alternative to treatments used currently. The method consists of computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic puncture and partial evacuation of the hematoma. After fibrinolysis with urokinase, the residual hematoma can be completely evacuated via a catheter introduced into the cavity of the hematoma. Only one of the 14 patients died in the direct postoperative phase; the remaining patients were enjoying a good to very good quality of life 6 months after the acute event. Two patients subsequently died as a result of pneumonia and cerebral infarction, respectively; both conditions were unrelated to the hemorrhage. The authors conclude that the CT-guided stereotactic method is simple, effective, and safe, and can be applied to patients of any age.\r"

While there was no significant change in total water content in the periventricular white matter at any stage of hydrocephalus, free water content was significantly elevated and bound water content was decreased at the acute and subacute stages, with a return to relatively normal levels at the chronic stage. It is concluded that in the periventricular white matter, free water enters the brain across the ependymal lining during the acute and subacute stages of experimental hydrocephalus with a simultaneous reduction in the bound water and that there is some recovery at the chronic stage. It is suggested that alternative drainage pathways may develop in chronic hydrocephalus allowing drainage of free water in the periventricular white matter, which in turn permits bound water to return to relatively normal levels.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a single injection of porcine insulin on free amino acid levels in plasma, erythrocytes, hepatopancreas and skeletal muscle were simultaneously monitored in common carp; the fish were force-fed a complete diet composed of crystalline amino acids as the sole protein precursors (amino acid diet) to study the dynamics of amino acid metabolism. The force-feeding of the amino acid diet caused surges in the concentrations of almost all amino acids in fish injected with saline, and amino acid levels reached peaks within 1 h in plasma as well as in hepatopancreas. It took more than 2.5 h for most amino acids to reach maximum levels in erythrocytes and skeletal muscle of the same fish. The injection of insulin stimulated drastic reductions of free amino acid levels in the plasma. At the same time, it facilitated reduction of free amino acid levels without elevating glutamine and ammonia levels in erythrocytes, hepatopancreas or skeletal muscle. These results suggest that exogenous insulin accelerated assimilation of dietary free amino acids and their deposition in these tissues.\r"

In this study, we examined the effects of 8 d of high fat feeding on brown fat mitochondrial GDP binding (an in vitro index of thermogenic activity) in lean (Fa/?) and obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats. Six-week-old female rats were fed a defined low fat control diet (9.5% of energy from fat) only during the dark cycle (1200-2400 h), and food intake was measured daily at 1200, 1600, 2300, and 2400 h for 7 d (the control period). For the next 8 d, half of the lean and obese rats were fed a high fat diet (65% of energy from fat), and the others remained on the low fat control diet. Each rat was fed the amount of energy equivalent to its average energy intake during the 7-d control period. Rats were killed at 0800-1000 h. In the lean rats, high fat feeding increased GDP binding. This increased binding in the lean rats appeared to reflect levels of dietary fat and carbohydrate and was independent of caloric intake. The blunted GDP binding of the obese rats failed to respond to dietary changes.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of feeding frequency on liver branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) activity are unknown. In the present study, rats were trained to consume their daily allotment of food in 6 h (meal-feeding). Rats were fed diets containing 0, 9, 25 or 50% casein and after 10 d were killed before or 3 h after the meal. The enzyme in rats fed diets containing 0, 9 and 25% casein was activated three- to sixfold after meal consumption. Previous studies showed that the liver enzyme is essentially fully activated in post-absorptive rats fed an adequate protein diet ad libitum. Meal-feeding an adequate protein (25% casein) diet resulted in a marked decrease in the postabsorptive percentage of active complex compared to ad libitum feeding of the same diet (29 +/- 6% vs. 93 +/- 6% active). Administration of alpha-ketoisocaproate (200 mumol/100 g body weight, an inhibitor of BCKAD kinase) reversed the meal-feeding-induced inactivation of the complex within 10 min. We conclude that the frequency of food intake, in addition to the level of dietary protein, influences the proportion of liver BCKAD in the active state. Inactivation of hepatic BCKAD in rats trained to feed once a day may be an adaptive mechanism that results in increased efficiency of branched-chain amino acid utilization between meals.\r"

  ".W": "The nef gene has been reported to be a silencer of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription that requires the presence of the negative regulatory element (NRE) located at the 5' end of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) to exert its negative effect. We have examined nuclear extracts from human, nontransformed T cells for factors that bind to the NRE of HIV-1 and to determine whether binding of factors to this region can be affected by the nef gene. Using gel retardation and methylation interference assays, we have observed several DNA binding factors that bind to a region between nucleotides -315 and -240 upstream of the cap site, within the NRE segment of the 5' LTR. Furthermore, the precise locations of the binding sites for two of these factors, termed here A1 and R, were determined. Factor A1 appears to belong to a family of cellular activation associated factors (called here A1-A4), but it is distinct in that it is the only DNA binding factor so far observed that appears to be downregulated by the nef gene or its product and that it has been found only in cells undergoing lymphokine-driven cell division. In contrast to the A factors, factor R appears to be associated with cellular quiescence and binds to a nearby but distinct site in the NRE. Experiments in which extracts were mixed before gel retardation suggest that the binding of factors R and A1 are mutually exclusive. Based on these observations we propose a model in which the nef gene aids in the maintenance of HIV latency by downregulating the binding of proliferation associated DNA binding factor, which we have called A1.\r"

  ".U": "90308696\r", 
  ".W": "By using a two-lever drug discrimination task, four groups of rats were trained to discriminate either a low (3.0 mg/kg) and a high (5.6 mg/kg) training dose of the kappa opioid agonist U50,488 [trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolindinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamine methanesulfonate hydrate] or a low (3.0 mg/kg) and a high (10 mg/kg) training dose of the mu opioid agonist morphine from water. The stimulus effects of the high training dose of U50,488 were shared by the kappa agonists bremazocine and ethylketocyclazocine (i.e., these drugs produced at least 80% drug-appropriate responding), but not by the mu agonists morphine, fentanyl and l-methadone or the nonopioid compounds d-amphetamine, pentobarbital and phencyclidine. Conversely, the stimulus effects of the high training dose of morphine were shared by other mu agonists, but not by the kappa agonists or the nonopioid compounds examined. Similarities in the stimulus effects of morphine and U50,488 occurred, however, when mu and kappa agonists were examined in rats trained to discriminate relatively low training doses of morphine or U50,488 from water. At the low training dose of morphine, complete substitution was obtained with the mu agonists tested as well as the kappa agonist ketocyclazocine. In these rats, intermediate (approximately 70% drug-appropriate responding) levels of substitution were obtained with the kappa agonists bremazocine and ethyylketocyclazocine. Similarly, at the low training dose of U50,488 both the mu and kappa agonists examined substituted completely. Asymmetrical substitution occurred between U50,488 and morphine at the low training doses, with morphine substituting completely for the low training dose of U50,488 and U50,488 failing to substitute for the low training dose of morphine. The rank order of potency for naloxone as an antagonist of the stimulus effects of morphine and U50,488 was; 3.0 mg/kg of morphine greater than 10 mg/kg of morphine greater than 3.0 mg/kg of U50,488 = 5.6 mg/kg of U50,488. The present results indicate that training dose is an important determinant of the different levels of cross-substitution obtained between mu and kappa agonists, and that a greater pharmacological specificity of drug-induced discriminative stimuli can be obtained when relatively high training doses of mu and kappa opioid agonists are used to establish the discrimination.\r"

  ".W": "Rhesus monkeys (n = 6), trained in a two-lever, food-reinforced paradigm to discriminate cocaine (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg, i.m.) from saline, received injections of cocaine (0.025-0.40 mg/kg, i.v. or i.m.) or various direct and indirect acting agonists (i.v.). Administration of cocaine resulted in a dose-related increase in the percentage of responses that occurred on the drug-appropriate lever. The indirect dopamine agonists GBR 12909 (0.2-1.6 mg/kg), mazindol (0.025-0.4 mg/kg), nomifensine (0.025-0.2 mg/kg) and bupropion (0.1-1.6 mg/kg) each produced dose-related increases in cocaine-appropriate responding, with complete substitution for cocaine achieved at the highest doses of each drug. In contrast, the norepinephrine re-uptake blockers tomoxetine (0.8-6.4 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0.4-1.6 mg/kg), the serotonin re-uptake blocker fluoxetine (1.6-12.8 mg/kg), the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (3.2-12.8 mg/kg) and the D2 agonist quinpirole (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) failed to engender cocaine-appropriate responding. Administration of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.05-0.2 mg/kg, i.m.) 20 min before cocaine resulted in a 4- to 8-fold parallel shift to the right in the cocaine dose-response function. Similarly, the D2 antagonist haloperidol (0.003-0.012 mg/kg, i.m.) produced at least a 2-fold shift to the right in the cocaine dose-response function. The results indicate that blockade of dopamine re-uptake is sufficient to mimic the cocaine discriminative stimulus and suggest that stimulation of either D1 or D2 receptors is necessary but not sufficient for the expression of the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine.\r"

These increases in NT concentration in the nucleus accumbens and caudate have been hypothesized to underlie the therapeutic and extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic drugs, respectively. The present study evaluates the effects of the putative antipsychotic and selective sigma receptor \"antagonist\" BMY 14802 on regional brain NT concentrations. NT concentrations in discrete brain regions of adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats were measured by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. Like haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.), acute and chronic treatment with BMY 14802 (35 mg/kg/day i.p.) produced significant increases in the concentrations of NT in the nucleus accumbens and anterior and posterior caudate. This effect was dose-dependent. Maximal increases in NT concentration were observed 18 hr after a single dose of BMY 14802. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with the sigma \"agonist\" (+)-SKF 10,047 (20 mg/kg i.p.), the N-methyl-D-aspartate-phencyclidine binding site antagonist MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) or the selective D2 antagonist sulpiride (100 mg/kg i.p.), produced the pattern of NT alterations observed after the administration of BMY 14802. These findings suggest that the blockade of sigma receptors modulates NT concentrations in these brain regions.\r"

However, the site or sites where PCP produces these effects is not known. This study sequentially examined the effects of PCP on the different components of the central nervous system-pituitary-adrenal axis. PCP did not produce corticosterone release in dispersed adrenal cells in vitro, nor did it stimulate the release of corticosterone in hypophysectomized rats, showing that PCP-induced corticosterone release in intact animals is secondary to the release of ACTH from the pituitary. PCP failed to alter either the basal or the corticotropin releasing factor-induced release of ACTH from superfused pituitaries in vitro, indicating that PCP does not act directly at the level of the pituitary. PCP increased plasma levels of ACTH in adrenalectomized rats, demonstrating that PCP does not stimulate the release of ACTH only by blocking glucocorticoid negative feedback mechanisms. PCP stimulated the release of both ACTH and corticosterone when given by injection directly into brain via the lateral cerebral ventricles. These results indicate that PCP activates the pituitary-adrenal axis by acting at a site or sites within the central nervous system, leading to the subsequent release of ACTH from the pituitary.\r"

MK-801 depressed the peak amplitude and accelerated the decay of end-plate currents. The drug (1-10 microM) decreased the frequency of activation of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced single-channel currents in addition to shortening the mean open and burst times of channels activated by either ACh or (+)anatoxin-a (AnTX). MK-801 (10-40 microM) depressed the single potentials and trains of ACh and AnTX-induced potentials in chronically denervated rat soleus muscles. MK-801 blocked the twitch responses (20-100 microM) of both frog sartorius and rat diaphragm muscles evoked by stimulation of their respective nerves. Also this drug (less than 1 microM) decreased the frequency of channels activated by AnTX or ACh in outside-out patch membranes of rat retinal ganglion cells with minimal changes in the channel open time. MK-801 (10-25 microM) depressed (-)nicotine-evoked gamma-amino[2,3-3H]butyric acid release from rat hippocampal synaptosomes; however, it failed to affect the binding of [3H](-)nicotine to brain membranes and also failed to interfere with the binding of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin to either frog muscle or Torpedo membranes. On the other hand, MK-801 inhibited the binding of [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin to Torpedo membranes and such an effect was more pronounced in the presence of carbamylcholine. Neither AnTX nor any other nicotinic agonist increased the binding of [3H]MK-801 to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ion channel complex. The actions of MK-801 were evident at concentrations comparable with those needed to block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These results demonstrate the existence of at least three different types of nicotinic AChR, all of which were blocked noncompetitively by MK-801.\r"

The proposed mu agonists, morphine and [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO), and the nonselective delta agonist, [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), produced a dose-related inhibition of gastrointestinal transit at the peak time and the i.p. doses producing a 50% reduction of the control values (A50) were 0.015, 0.006 and 0.023 mg/kg, respectively, for morphine, DAMGO and DADLE. The effect of the other nonselective delta agonist, [D-Ser2,L-Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr (DSLET), was not linearly related with the dose. The proposed selective delta agonist, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), and the selective kappa agonist, U-69,593, up to 2 and 15 mg/kg i.p., respectively, did not delay gastrointestinal transit. Naloxone (0.05 mg/kg i.p.) injected 1 min before each agonist produced a significant parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curves for morphine and DAMGO, but only partly antagonized the effects of DADLE and DSLET. The selective delta antagonist ICI 174,864 (1 mg/kg i.p., injected 1 min before each agonist) shifted the dose-response curve of DADLE, but not of the mu agonists, slightly, but significantly to the right, and had an inconsistent effect on DSLET. Naloxone prevented DADLE's effect on the gut with a nonlinear dose-response curve and much higher doses of naloxone were required to prevent fully DADLE-induced effects than to antagonize doses of morphine equiactive to DADLE on the gut.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although death rates in targeted hospitals were 5.0 to 10.9 higher per 100 admissions than in untargeted hospitals, 56% to 82% of the excess could result from purely random variation. Differences in the quality of the process of care (based on a medical record review) could not explain the remaining statistically significant differences in mortality. Comparing targeted hospitals with subsets of untargeted ones, eg, those with lower than expected death rates, did not affect this conclusion. Severity of illness explained up to 2.8 excess deaths per 100 admissions for patients with myocardial infarction. Identifying hospitals that provide poor-quality care based on administrative data and single-year death rates is unlikely; targeting based on time periods greater than 1 year may be better.\r"

For recurrent or continued bleeding, the mean rate in control patients was 0.39, and the pooled rate difference, or reduction due to therapy, was 0.27 +/- 0.15 (95% confidence interval) (69% relative reduction). For emergency surgery, the mean rate in control patients was 0.26, and the pooled rate difference was 0.16 +/- 0.05 (62% relative reduction). Most important, for overall mortality, the mean rate in control patients was 0.10, and the pooled rate difference was 0.03 +/- 0.02 (30% relative reduction). The effects were greatest in patients with spurting or visible blood vessels and equivocal when the ulcer showed only signs of recent bleeding. We conclude that endoscopic hemostasis is clearly effective but that data were insufficient for direct comparisons between modalities. Randomized control trials to compare the different modes of endoscopic therapy should continue.\r"

  ".U": "90308925\r", 
  ".W": "Soon after the discovery of radium, a school of practitioners arose who were interested primarily in the physiological rather than the tumoricidal powers of this new radioactive element. This treatment philosophy was called \"mild radium therapy\" and involved the oral or parenteral administration of microgram quantities of radium and its daughter isotopes, often as cures for rheumatic diseases, hypertension, and metabolic disorders. Manufacturers of patent medicines responded to this market by producing a variety of over-the-counter radioactive preparations including pills, elixirs, and salves. One such nostrum was Radithor, a popular and expensive mixture of radium 226 and radium 228 in distilled water. Radithor was advertised as an effective treatment for over 150 \"endocrinologic\" diseases, especially lassitude and sexual impotence. Over 400,000 bottles, each containing over 2 muCi (74 kBq) of radium, were apparently marketed and sold worldwide between 1925 and 1930. The death of the Pittsburgh millionaire sportsman Eben M. Byers, who was an avid Radithor user, by radium poisoning in 1932 brought an end to this era and prompted the development of regulatory controls for all radiopharmaceuticals.\r"

Alveolar surface tension was elevated by displacement of pulmonary surfactant from the alveolar hypophase by the aerosolized detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (OT). After measurement of baseline hemodynamics, arterial blood gases, and airway pressure, the dogs were separated into groups: Group I inhaled a 1% solution of OT (15 mg/kg) in a vehicle of equal parts saline and ethanol; group II inhaled the same volume of vehicle without OT. The pulmonary clearance of technetium 99m diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) (half-time in minutes) was studied immediately after aerosol (OT and vehicle) delivery and compared with that of historical control values. No change was seen in arterial blood gases and airway pressure after vehicle inhalation, whereas OT caused a marked fall in arterial oxygen tension and increase in airway pressure. Vehicle inhalation effected only a slight increase in DTPA clearance, whereas OT significantly reduced half-time over control and group II. These data suggest that high alveolar surface tension increases alveolar epithelial permeability.\r"

Seventy-two ewes, (six groups of 12 animals) had a 7 x 5 cm portion of the pericardium excised. Each group had either the defect left open, primarily resutured, replaced with coarse Dexon No. 2 mesh (American Cyanamid Co., Danbury, Conn.), replaced with fine Dexon No. 8 mesh, replaced with glutaraldehyde-preserved bovine pericardium, or replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene 0.1 mm surgical membrane. Six animals from each group were assessed at 3 months and the remaining six animals were assessed at 6 months. The open-defect and resutured groups served as control animals. None of the substitutes proved superior to the open-defect group in the prevention of chest wall/lung-to-pericardium adhesions at either 3 or 6 months. The limitations of the animal model in assessing this aspect of substitute performance are discussed. Whereas the bovine pericardium, polytetrafluorethylene, and Dexon No. 8 mesh groups were superior to the resutured group in the prevention of pericardium-to-epithelium adhesions in the area of the patch, this advantage was lost at 6 months when resuturing proved as effective as polytetrafluoroethylene and bovine pericardium. In all groups there was little tendency to produce generalized pericardial adhesions. At 3 months Dexon No. 8 mesh and bovine pericardium produced the least amount of significant epicardial reaction. In two animals in the 3-month polytetrafluoroethylene group and in one animal in the 6-month polytetrafluoroethylene group, a \"fibrous peel\" was encountered on the inner surface of the patch, which had also become adherent to the epicardium and had obscured the underlying anatomy. At 6 months the open-defect, resutured, and bovine pericardium groups had produced no significant epicardial reaction. In one animal at 6 months the bovine pericardium had become markedly thickened and degenerative. We do not recommend routine closure of the pericardium after coronary artery operations with any of the substitutes investigated in our study.\r"

To determine the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7-associated diarrhea in our patient population, we surveyed all submitted stool cultures for 6 months for this organism. Specimens were screened for non-sorbitol fermenting E. coli and confirmed by slide-agglutination and immobilization testing. Of 2,164 specimens, 10 yielded E. coli O157:H7. It was the fourth most common bacterial stool pathogen found. Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms of the infected patients. E. coli O157:H7 causes sporadic infections in our patient population and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic colitis.\r"

Evidence in favor of such a hypothesis, based on various genetic studies reported during the past few decades, is reviewed. We add to the existing literature our experience with six cases of familial testicular cancer encountered during a 10-year period, consisting of four father-and-son pairs, one pair of nontwin brothers, and a 23-year-old man who had a maternal uncle with a history of testicular cancer.\r"

Analysis of the clinical course of these five patients and our patient revealed the importance of long-term sulfonamide antibiotic therapy in combination with surgical pericardial drainage procedures. In our review, only patients who received antibiotics and underwent pericardiectomy survived. Our case substantiates the excellent penetration of sulfisoxazole into the pericardial fluid, even with oral administration of the drug, and provides evidence in support of aggressive management of Nocardia pericarditis.\r"

This review concentrates on disorders of motility that occur in conjunction with diseases of the extrinsic neural supply (from the level of the brain to the postganglionic fibers) and those generalized disorders that affect gut smooth muscle. Modern technology, such as gastrointestinal scintigraphy and manometric techniques that measure esophageal, gastroduodenal, and anorectal motility (intraluminal pressures), has provided better methods to study the pathophysiologic aspects of gut motility in diseases of the nervous system. Distinguishing the neuropathies of the extrinsic nervous system from those of the intrinsic (enteric) nervous system is not always possible because the available techniques evaluate only the end-organ--that is, the motor function of the gut. Degenerative or infiltrative (myopathic) disorders of gut smooth muscle, however, can be distinguished from such neuropathies, and careful and systematic evaluation of autonomic function can often identify the level of disordered function in the neural-gut axis.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1978 and 1988, three patients at our institution had an initial diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but later were correctly diagnosed as having pulmonary-renal syndrome and microscopic polyarteritis. These cases involved elderly patients with progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough, bilateral dry crackling rales, bilateral interstitial infiltrates evident on a chest roentgenogram, and restrictive findings on pulmonary function testing. In two patients, lung biopsy specimens were obtained, and an initial diagnosis of nonspecific pulmonary fibrosis was made. All three patients eventually had microhematuria and renal insufficiency. A revised diagnosis of small-vessel pulmonary-renal vasculitis was based on the demonstration of segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis in renal biopsy specimens in two patients, thrombotic microangiopathy consistent with healed vasculitis on postmortem examination of the kidney in one patient, and subsequent detection of small-vessel vasculitis on review of the two lung biopsy specimens. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies with perinuclear staining on indirect immunofluorescence microscopy were positive in the two patients in whom determinations were performed. The clinical manifestations of vasculitis were notably scarce--no involvement of the skin, nervous system, or gastrointestinal tract; no episodes of fever; and minimal or absent musculoskeletal symptoms. These cases illustrate the importance of a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis in elderly patients and the need to consider a vasculitis in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, especially if an active urinary sediment is present.\r"

The glomerular capillary hyperperfusion, hypertension, and hyperfiltration that occur in the surviving nephrons may play an important role in the natural tendency for renal function to deteriorate. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that these glomerular hemodynamic events may not be the final common pathway for the natural deterioration of renal function, as was once thought. With regard to the general management of patients with impaired renal function, recent evidence suggests that controlling systemic blood pressure, reducing dietary protein and phosphorus intake, and controlling hyperlipidemia may be effective in slowing the loss of renal function.\r"

Although infection has decreased in frequency and severity with the advent of antiviral and antibacterial agents, prevention, early diagnosis, and suitable treatment with appropriate antibiotic(s) will be necessary to obtain desirable results and to reduce morbidity and mortality.

  ".W": "Uric acid, as the end-product of purine metabolism in humans, presents a clinical problem because of its relative insolubility, particularly in the acid environment of the distal nephron of the kidney. As a result, states of enhanced purine catabolism increase the urate load on the kidney, leading to intrarenal precipitation. Major causes of increased purine metabolism are malignancies with rapid cell turnover, such as leukemias and lymphomas, and the added acceleration of cell lysis that occurs with chemotherapy and radiation. Serum urate levels rise rapidly, and acute renal failure occurs as a consequence of tubular deposition of urate and uric acid. The keys to the diagnosis of acute uric acid nephropathy are the appropriate clinical setting of increased cell lysis, oliguria, marked hyperuricemia, and hyperuricosuria. A urinary uric acid-to-creatinine ratio greater than 1 helps to distinguish acute uric acid nephropathy from other catabolic forms of acute renal failure in which serum urate is elevated. Preventive treatment involves pharmacologic xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol and alkaline diuresis. Occasionally, acute renal failure occurs despite allopurinol because of the tubular precipitation of the precursor metabolites, such as xanthine, which accumulate with xanthine oxidase inhibition. Dialysis therapy may be required both to correct azotemia and to reduce the body burden of urate. Hemodialysis is preferred because it can achieve greater clearance than other dialysis modes.\r"

The two categories of treatment for glomerulonephritis are (1) treatment for the pathophysiologic complications of glomerulonephritis, such as hypertension, fluid overload, and uremia, and (2) treatment for the inflammatory injury, which usually employs immunosuppression with steroids and cytotoxic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Drug-induced renal disease is a common problem. Drugs cause several renal syndromes, such as prerenal azotemia, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and chronic interstitial nephritis. Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis is the most common syndrome and is most frequently caused by aminoglycoside antibiotics, radiographic contrast agents, and amphotericin B. Avoidance of these drugs in volume-depleted or hypotensive patients with preexisting renal disease or in those receiving multiple nephrotoxic drugs is the most effective way to reduce nephrotoxicity. Acute interstitial nephritis is an immune process that is most commonly caused by penicillins, diuretics, allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cimetidine, and sulfonamides. Prompt recognition of the disease and cessation of the responsible drug are usually the only necessary therapy. Chronic interstitial nephritis is most often seen after prolonged use of several different types of analgesic agents, including aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These patients develop recurrent papillary necrosis and eventually chronic renal failure. They are also at risk of developing transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary collecting system. Some patients who are receiving cyclosporine also develop chronic renal failure due to interstitial fibrosis.\r"

The level of urinary tract obstruction is variable, dependent on the underlying disease, and may range from the loop of Henle to the urethral meatus. Clinical manifestations are most commonly due to renal failure, but the history and physical examination can aid in determining the localization and cause of the obstruction. Laboratory findings may suggest urinary tract obstruction as the etiology for acute renal failure. Radiologic procedures, most prominently ultrasonography, can establish the diagnosis. Treatment is variable, but patient management may need to be altered during the postobstructive phase of urinary tract obstruction owing to physiologic response to reestablishment of urine flow.\r"

The essential steps in the management of HRS are to identify and correct the precipitating factors leading to HRS and avoidance of potential hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic drugs. Patients with potentially reversible liver diseases should be treated aggressively. Volume expansion is important and should be tried first, even though hypovolemia may be not clinically evident.

Decreased calcium absorption from the GI tract, secondary to low calcitriol levels; hyperphosphatemia; skeletal resistance to the action of parathormone; and aluminum deposition on the surface of the bones are its main pathogenetic mechanisms. Its biochemical features include abnormalities in serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, calcitriol, and aluminum concentration. Radiographic methods are of little use in the characterization of the type of osteodystrophy present, but they may be of help in assessing mineral loss from the skeleton. Clinical manifestations are from bones (pain, deformities, fractures) or from metastatic calcifications. Bone biopsy is the definitive means of diagnosis. The main histologic types of osteodystrophy include osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia, mixed form (with features of both osteitis fibrosa and osteomalacia), and aluminum osteodystrophy (presenting as either osteomalacia or aplastic lesion). The management of renal osteodystrophy should address all the pathogenetic mechanisms. Correction of the abnormalities in calcium and phosphate metabolism and prevention of aluminum osteodystrophy are the cardinal rules of management. Specific measures (parathyroidectomy, chelation of aluminum) have clear-cut indications and usually require a bone biopsy.\r"

Most of the episodes of peritonitis are caused by touch contamination of the dialysis tubing or by extension of the catheter exit site or tunnel infection. Coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus are the two most common organisms, accounting for 50% or more of all CAPD peritonitis. Other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi account for the rest. Intraperitoneal antibiotic treatments are usually effective in eradicating the infection. The choice of antibiotics depends on organisms isolated from cultured dialysate. Fungal peritonitis and, occasionally, Pseudomonas peritonitis require removal of the catheter to eradicate the infection. Prompt identification and treatment of peritonitis are essential to ensure success of a CAPD program. Although with newer techniques, like Y-connector or ultraviolet light system, the rate of peritonitis has declined; however, it has still remained the major complication of the CAPD program.\r"

Among 6 patients examined within one week, 5 had antibody secreting cells in CSF, and all 19 patients examined 2-8 weeks after onset had such cells in CSF. Blood examined from 5 patients contained anti-BCG IgG or IgM antibody secreting cells, but usually at much lower numbers than in corresponding CSF, indicating that the specific antibody response is largely confined to CSF. Anti-BCG antibodies measured in parallel by ELISA were slightly raised in CSF in only 1 of the 6 patients examined within a week, whereas a good correspondence was seen between numbers of antibody secreting cells and antibody concentrations from the second week onwards. Detection of anti-BCG IgG antibody secreting cells has higher sensitivity and specificity than ELISA measurement of anti-BCG IgG antibodies, and represents a new, useful method for the early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.\r"

Excellent agreement was found between the initial challenges of apomorphine and levodopa. Apomorphine also accurately predicted the response to long-term levodopa in 90% of the patients. There were 8 false-negative results; 7 were in patients with mild deficits. The apomorphine test is a quick, safe, reliable indicator of dopaminergic responsiveness in parkinsonian syndromes. The test is especially helpful to reassess patients who seem to have become less responsive to levodopa and it also has some predictive value in the assessment of an untreated patient's likely response to dopaminergic therapy.\r"

Test results were correlated with strength in the tibialis anterior muscle as determined by measurement of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), using strain gauge tensiometers, and were also correlated with a clinical spasticity rating scale. Patients were tested every 6 to 8 weeks over more than 1 year. Compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAPa) from tibialis anterior correlated best with MVIC and also showed a strong linear correlation with time, as did MVIC. Other tests correlated poorly with MVIC on the average, although individual patients did show high correlations. In those patients where correlation between CMAPa and MVIC was low, MVIC did not show a high linear correlation with time and was also highly variable. This study suggests that the addition of CMAPa should be considered in ALS therapeutic trials if MVIC is not available. In addition, CMAPa can be useful in study samples where MVIC deterioration is not linear over time or is highly variable.\r"

The protein has homologies with a number of cytoskeletal proteins, is localized at the muscle sarcolemma and it may provide stability to the muscle plasma membrane. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we have studied dystrophin localization at the myotendinous junction, a region of membrane complexity that requires more stability because it is subjected to great mechanical stress during the transmission of contractile force to the tendon. The results showed subsarcolemmal deposits of dystrophin at the junctional folds of the myotendon as well as membrane-associated dystrophin at extrajunctional sarcolemma. The findings suggest that dystrophin may be one of the components linking terminal actin filaments to the subplasmalemmal surface of the junctional folds of the myotendon.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Although cachexia often accompanies advanced heart failure, little is known about the causes of the cachectic state. To assess the potential role of tumor necrosis factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac cachexia, we measured serum levels of the factor in 33 patients with chronic heart failure, 33 age-matched healthy controls, and 9 patients with chronic renal failure. RESULTS. Mean (+/- SEM) serum levels of tumor necrosis factor were higher in the patients with heart failure (115 +/- 25 U per milliliter) than in the healthy controls (9 +/- 3 U per milliliter; P less than 0.001). Nineteen of the patients with chronic heart failure had serum levels of tumor necrosis factor greater than or equal to 39 U per milliliter (greater than 2 SD above the mean value for the control group), whereas the remaining 14 patients had serum levels of tumor necrosis factor below this level. The patients with high levels of tumor necrosis factor were more cachectic than those with low levels (82 +/- 3 vs. 95 +/- 6 percent of ideal body weight, respectively; P less than 0.05) and had more advanced heart failure, as evidenced by their higher values for plasma renin activity (2.92 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.53 ng per liter per second [10.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.9 ng per milliliter per hour]; P less than 0.01) and lower serum sodium concentration (135 +/- 1 vs. 138 +/- 1 mmol per liter; P less than 0.05). The group with high levels of tumor necrosis factor also had lower hemoglobin levels (7.82 +/- 0.2 vs. 8.69 +/- 0.4 mmol per liter [12.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 14.0 +/- 0.6 g per deciliter]) and higher values for blood urea nitrogen (19.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 12.5 +/- 1.8 mmol per liter) than the group with low levels of tumor necrosis factor (P less than 0.05 for both). The high levels of tumor necrosis factor were not due solely to decreased renal clearance, however, since the levels in the patients with heart failure were considerably higher than those in the nine patients with chronic renal failure (115 +/- 25 vs. 45 +/- 25 U per milliliter; P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor are increased in cachectic patients with chronic heart failure and that this elevation is associated with the marked activation of the renin-angiotensin system seen in patients with end-stage cardiac disease.\r"

We compared the resistance to eight agents of Escherichia coli in stool samples from untreated, healthy children in cities on three continents. RESULTS. When screened by a selective method that detected 1 resistant colony in 10,000 colonies, nearly half the children in Boston (18 of 39) had no resistant colonies--a finding consistent with the findings of other surveys performed in developed countries. However, all but 1 of 41 children screened in Caracas, Venezuela, and all but 2 of 53 in Qin Pu, China, carried resistant strains. Only 1 child in Boston but 25 in Caracas and 34 in Qin Pu carried strains resistant to trimethoprim. None of the children in Boston or Caracas but 17 in Qin Pu carried strains resistant to gentamicin. Among 10 colonies selected randomly from each stool sample, the average frequency of resistance in Caracas was 3.6 times greater than in Boston, and that in Qin Pu was 5.3 times greater. There was resistance to five or more antimicrobial agents in 20 percent of the Qin Pu strains and in 6 percent of the Caracas strains but in none of the Boston strains. CONCLUSIONS. In addition to clinical isolates, as reported previously, the bacteria that colonize health children in the community may be resistant far more often in some regions than in others. A low rate of carriage of antimicrobial resistance in the community should become a public health goal.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Oral lichen planus is a relatively common disorder of the mouth that can be debilitating. It is frequently palliated with topical or systemic corticosteroids and retinoids. These treatments require prolonged use, however, and are not always effective. METHODS. In a double-blind trial, 16 patients with symptomatic oral lichen planus were randomly assigned to receive either topical cyclosporine or its vehicle. The patients swished and expectorated 5 ml of medication (containing 100 mg of cyclosporine per milliliter) three times daily. RESULTS. After eight weeks, the eight recipients of cyclosporine had marked improvement in erythema (P = 0.003), erosion (P = 0.02), reticulation (presence of white lacelike lesions; P = 0.007), and pain (P = 0.002), whereas the eight recipients of vehicle had no change or minimal improvement. After a switch to cyclosporine for eight weeks, the vehicle-treated patients had improvement similar to that seen in the patients who initially received cyclosporine. There were no systemic side effects. In most cases blood cyclosporine levels were low or undertectable. Cyclosporine levels present in specimens of oral mucosa at the end of therapy four hours after the patients swished were similar to the levels previously reported in psoriatic lesions after treatment with systemic cyclosporine (14 mg per kilogram of body weight per day). CONCLUSIONS. As a topical preparation, cyclosporine may be useful in the treatment of oral lichen planus and possibly other cutaneous disorders.\r"

  ".U": "90309929\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Chronic hepatitis B is a common and often progressive liver disorder for which there is no accepted therapy. To assess the efficacy of treatment with interferon, we randomly assigned patients with chronic hepatitis B to one of the following regimens: prednisone for 6 weeks followed by 5 million units of recombinant interferon alfa-2b daily for 16 weeks; placebo followed by 5 million units of interferon daily for 16 weeks; placebo followed by 1 million units of interferon daily for 16 weeks; or observation with no treatment. RESULTS. Hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B viral DNA disappeared from serum significantly more often in the patients given prednisone plus interferon (16 of 44 patients, or 36 percent) or 5 million units of interferon alone (15 of 41; 37 percent) than in the untreated controls (3 of 43; 7 percent; P less than 0.001); the difference between those given 1 million units of interferon (7 of 41; 17 percent) and the controls was not significant. The strongest independent predictor of a response to treatment was the amount of hepatitis B viral DNA in serum at entry (P less than 0.0001). Of the 38 patients who responded to interferon, 33 (87 percent) had normal serum aminotransferase levels after therapy; 11 patients who responded (29 percent), but no controls, lost the hepatitis B surface antigen. Blinded histologic assessment revealed a significant improvement in periportal necrosis in the treated patients (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. In chronic hepatitis B, treatment with interferon alfa-2b (5 million units per day for 16 weeks) was effective in inducing a sustained loss of viral replication and achieving remission, assessed biochemically and histologically, in over a third of patients. Moreover, in about 10 percent of the patients treated with interferon, hepatitis B surface antigen disappeared from serum.\r"

  ".U": "90309931\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Fetal macrosomia occurs despite nearly normal maternal blood glucose levels in women with diabetes treated with insulin. We examined the hypothesis that it may be caused by insulin transferred as an insulin-antibody complex from the mother to her fetus. We adapted and validated a method based on high-performance liquid chromatography and used it to quantitate insulin in small volumes (0.5 to 1.0 ml) of cord serum from 51 infants born to mothers with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS. In mothers receiving only human insulin (n = 6), only human insulin was detected in cord serum. Of the remaining 45 infants, whose mothers received animal insulin during pregnancy, 28 (group 1) had levels of animal (bovine or porcine) insulin (mean [+/- SE], 707 +/- 163 pmol per liter) that constituted 27.4 +/- 2.5 percent of the total insulin concentration (2393 +/- 500 pmol per liter) measured in the cord serum. The cord-serum insulin concentration in the remaining 17 infants (group 2), in whom only human insulin was detected (381 +/- 56 pmol per liter), was only 15 percent of that in group 1 (P less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the maternal and the cord-serum concentrations of anti-insulin antibody and the concentration of animal insulin in the baby (r = 0.77, P less than 0.01, and r = 0.76, P less than 0.001, respectively), suggesting that the animal insulin was transferred as an insulin-antibody complex. In group 1 the mean concentration of animal insulin in cord serum was higher in the 12 infants with macrosomia than in the 16 infants without the condition (1113 +/- 321 vs. 402 +/- 110 pmol per liter; P less than 0.05), and the concentration of animal insulin in cord serum correlated with birth weight (r = 0.39, P less than 0.05). The maternal glycosylated hemoglobin values and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome were similar in groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS. Considerable amounts of antibody-bound insulin are transferred from mother to fetus during pregnancy in some women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; the extent of transfer correlates with the maternal concentration of anti-insulin antibody. The correlation between macrosomia and the concentrations of animal insulin in cord serum indicates that the transferred insulin has biologic activity and suggests that the formation of antibody to insulin in the mother is a determinant of fetal outcome independent of maternal blood glucose levels.\r"

But the effect of these adaptations on fitness and the rapidity of their evolution is unknown, as is the extent to which they depend on pre-existing genetic variation rather than new mutations. We have begun a study of the evolutionary adaptation of Escherichia coli to different temperature regimes, taking advantage of the large population sizes and short generation times in experiments on this bacterial species. We report significant improvement in temperature-specific fitness of lines maintained at 42 degrees C for 200 generations (about one month). These changes in fitness are due to selection on de novo mutations and show that some biological systems can evolve rapidly in response to changes in environmental factors such as temperature.\r"

By contrast, the target of an acidic activating region is required both by acidic activators and by E1a.

  ".U": "90309991\r", 
  ".W": "Retroviruses are involved in several human neurological diseases with varying pathological features. Whether these diseases are due to a direct effect of the virus on nervous system cells is unknown. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of one retroviral neurological disease, we are studying the murine neurotropic retrovirus, Cas-Br-E, which causes lower motor neuron disease associated with spongiform degenerative changes in brain and spinal cord. Central nervous system (CNS) injury seems to be due to direct viral action, but the precise target cells of the virus are uncertain. After blood-borne virus enters the CNS it is found in capillary endothelial cells. No microscopic evidence for virus within glia or neurons has been found in some studies, whereas virus or incomplete particles have been observed in CNS cells in other studies. Here we identify the neuron as a major target for Cas-Br-E in the CNS, suggesting that this disease may be a direct result of viral infection of neurons. We also show that envelope protein (Env, encoded by the env gene), a major determinant of neurovirulence, cannot be detected in neurons but is present in non-neuronal cells, although spliced env messenger RNA is synthesized in CNS tissue. This suggests that a post-transcriptional step in Cas-Br-E Env protein synthesis is impaired and that the neurological disease may be a consequence of abortive replication of virus in neurons. This may explain the failure to find neuronal infection in other neurological diseases by conventional methods of virus detection.\r"

  ".U": "90310522\r", 
  ".W": "Arguments for routine total thyroidectomy or routine, less than total resection have been espoused for treatment of well-differentiated intrathyroidal carcinoma. Numerous reports in the literature support either approach. No prospective randomized studies have been performed, partly because of the indolent nature of the disease. Many reports are also complicated by the failure of the authors to divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups and to categorize and evaluate fully the histologic types of the resected tumors. Good evidence exists to show that in the majority of cases of intrathyroidal, well-differentiated lesions, bilateral subtotal resection yields results that compare favorably with total thyroidectomy. Logically, at least, a total thyroidectomy would seem to be preferable, because subtotal resection can be imprecise. Therefore, subtotal thyroidectomy can be recommended over total thyroidectomy, if only on the basis of comparison of complications. The type and rate of complications vary among surgeons. Each thyroid surgeon, therefore, must establish an individual complication rate. Total thyroidectomy in inexperienced hands is not recommended. We recommend, therefore, that total thyroidectomy be used selectively by surgeons who have the skill and experience necessary to make the decision intraoperatively. If, for example, during resection of the lobe that contains the primary tumor, the laryngeal nerves and parathyroid glands can be clearly identified and if there is minimal bleeding and trauma, the surgeon may proceed to side two to perform a total thyroidectomy. If the lesion is large, however, with distortion of anatomy, dissection may be difficult even for an experienced surgeon. Intracapsular parathyroids or undiscovered parathyroids on the side of initial resection should prompt the surgeon to perform a subtotal resection on side two. Under these circumstances, the surgeon should not feel that a total thyroidectomy justifies the increased risk. A unilateral resection, such as lobectomy plus isthmusectomy, can be performed with satisfactory long-term results in low-risk patients, that is, in those with small (less than 1.5 cm) unilateral intrathyroidal exposure and in those with no evidence of metastatic disease. Alternately, the AGES criteria of Hay et al can be used to identify patients in low- or high-risk groups. If the decision to perform a bilateral resection is based on the previous criteria, we recommend that a total thyroidectomy be performed only by an experienced surgeon. During surgery, if there is any suggestion that the laryngeal nerves or parathyroid glands would be at increased risk if a total resection were performed, it may be necessary to revert to a subtotal procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In such instances, we recommend that completion thyroidectomy be performed in the patient who has invasive carcinoma, is less than 70 years old, and has a reasonable life expectancy. The procedure should be carried out immediately if the error in diagnosis is discovered within a week; otherwise the procedure should be delayed until 3 to 4 months later. At that time, the recurrent laryngeal nerves and at least two parathyroid glands should be dissected and preserved. A paratracheal lymph node dissection should also be performed and the lower jugular lymph nodes should be sampled. If these jugular lymph nodes are found to be positive, a modified radical neck dissection should be added. The morbidity associated with the completion thyroidectomy is minimal. Postoperatively, a 131I scan of the neck should be carried out and ablative doses of radioactive iodine can be given if the uptake in the thyroid bed is greater than 1.5%. Subsequently, all patients are given thyroid suppressive therapy and are monitored closely. This approach will reduce the local recurrence rate and improve the long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "The approach to Hurthle cell neoplasms of the thyroid gland remains controversial because there is no consensus on the criteria used to establish malignancy. Invasion into the thyroid capsule, blood vessels, and contiguous structures in the neck and lymph nodes, or distant metastases establishes malignancy. Benign Hurthle cell lesions should be treated with total lobectomy and isthmusectomy. Total thyroidectomy is the recommended treatment for malignant Hurthle cell lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma, comprising approximately 7% of thyroid carcinoma, produces calcitonin, which can be monitored by immunoassay for diagnosis, at preclinical stages, and for persistent disease and its extent. It presents as sporadic and hereditary forms. The latter consists of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)-2A syndrome, which includes pheochromocytomas and hyperparathyroidism in some families, and the MEN-2B syndrome, which consistently includes mucosal neuromas and somatic features. The carcinoma, especially the MEN-2B variety, is more aggressive than well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. After the presence and management of a possible pheochromocytoma is resolved, treatment is by total thyroidectomy, the MEN-2 syndromes always indicating bilateral involvement. Gross evidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with metastases to regional lymph nodes, justifying removal of lymph nodes in the central neck, anterior superior mediastinum, and lateral neck. At operation, attention is given to preservation of parathyroid glands but also to removal of hyperplastic parathyroid glands; subtotal parathyroidectomy usually is needed if clinical hyperparathyroidism is evident. Diagnosis at the preclinical stage, C-cell hyperplasia, permits total thyroidectomy. Lateral cervical lymph node dissection is determined by biopsy of midjugular lymph nodes. In this situation, serum calcitonin levels are usually normal after operation, indicating cure. However, for palpable medullary thyroid carcinoma, serum calcitonin levels are often elevated after appropriate neck surgery. In this event, scanning techniques are used to monitor patients, and reoperation is performed if localization of medullary thyroid carcinoma is achieved. The mediastinum is particularly observed for recurrence. Reoperation is justified for recurrence in the neck and mediastinum. Early diagnosis and monitoring permits long-term survival. In the future it is anticipated that diagnostic genetic techniques will provide definitive and early diagnosis in the hereditary form, permitting earlier treatment with assurance of cure.\r"

  ".W": "Radioiodine is an important adjuvant treatment in the management of resectable papillary and follicular thyroid cancers in all patients except those with the best prognostic features. External radiation is also an important adjuvant therapy in these patients, especially those with tumors that extend beyond the thyroid gland and invade the trachea, esophagus, nerves, and blood vessels; it is especially important in treating patients whose tumors do not concentrate radioiodine. Radioiodine may be curative in patients with microscopic distant metastases demonstrated by radioiodine scanning. Even unresectable primary papillary and follicular cancers may be eradicated by combined therapy with radioiodine and radiotherapy. Radioiodine plays no significant role in the treatment of medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancers, but external radiation may eradicate microscopic thyroid bed or nodal disease when persistent disease is indicated by elevated calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer patients. Anaplastic thyroid cancers are usually unresectable and are not eradicated by conventional radiotherapy or by any of the novel radiation techniques, with or without chemotherapy. In all types of thyroid cancer, external radiotherapy may produce beneficial palliative results in patients with distant metastases, but the use of radioiodine should always be explored in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer patients.\r"
