  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest underwent baseline, early (after 2 weeks of therapy) and late (after 5 months, mean) electrophysiologic studies during oral amiodarone therapy. Inducible sustained VT was present in all patients at baseline study, in 21 of 22 at early and in 26 of 29 at late study. The cycle length of induced VT increased from 263 +/- 60 msec at baseline study to 305 +/- 58 msec at early follow-up study and to 318 +/- 64 msec at late study (p less than .05 = baseline vs late study). The ventricular effective refractory period increased from 237 +/- 22 msec at the baseline study to 253 +/- 26 msec at early and to 268 +/- 24 msec at late study (p less than 0.05 baseline vs early, baseline vs late and early vs late study). Twenty-four patients had no recurrent VT or cardiac arrest on amiodarone (group 1). Five patients had recurrent arrhythmia (group 2). In group 1, the ventricular effective refractory period increased by 39 +/- 19 msec, but in group 2 decreased by 4 +/- 27 from baseline to late follow-up study (p less than 0.05). Similarly, in group 1 the cycle length of induced VT increased by a mean of 75 +/- 56 msec but decreased in group 2 by a mean of 11 +/- 81 msec from baseline to late follow-up study (p less than 0.05). From the above findings we conclude: Chronic electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone are not completely manifest after 2 weeks of oral therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87073117\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics associated with spontaneous and inducible atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmia were assessed in 20 consecutive patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome undergoing surgical division (n = 12) or transcatheter electrical ablation (n = 8) of accessory pathways. Patients with spontaneous atrial fibrillation were characterized by the trend (not significant) of a shorter antegrade accessory pathway effective refractory period (256 +/- 26 vs 303 +/- 109 msec). However, patients with and without spontaneous atrial fibrillation did not differ with respect to prevalence of structural heart disease (3 of 11 vs 2 of 9), intra-atrial conduction time (34 +/- 10 vs 32 +/- 10 msec), or interatrial conduction time (86 +/- 21 vs 88 +/- 17 msec). Thus, atrial and accessory pathway electrophysiologic properties (per se) were not clear determinants of susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. Among the 20 patients, 10 to 35 beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (seven patients) or ventricular fibrillation (three patients) were induced at electrophysiologic study with one to three programmed extrastimuli. Clinically, a ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation during atrial fibrillation) had occurred in only one of these patients. The discordance of these observations was significant (p less than 0.01). Patients with and without inducible ventricular arrhythmias were not distinguished by clinical factors or by electrophysiologic properties of the accessory pathway or ventricles. Accessory pathway conduction was completely or partially eliminated by ablation procedures in 14 of 20 patients. During a mean follow-up of 27 months, atrial fibrillation recurred in two patients with failed ablation procedures and in one patient with left atrial enlargement (despite accessory pathway division) (p = 0.019 vs pre-ablation). Ventricular arrhythmias remained inducible in two patients in whom accessory pathway ablation failed (p = 0.01 vs initial study). However, spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias did not occur during follow-up. We conclude that susceptibility to spontaneous or inducible atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with WPW syndrome and no organic heart disease depends primarily on the existence of a functional accessory pathway. These susceptibilities are eliminated by interruption of accessory pathway conduction. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias remain infrequent spontaneous events in the WPW syndrome. Their more frequent induction at electrophysiologic study is not predictive of clinical occurrence.\r"

Seventeen men and five women, average age 63 years, completed this randomized parallel study. Twelve patients received mexiletine intravenously at (5 to 10 mg/min) until greater than or equal to 95% VPD suppression was achieved or a total of 450 mg of drug was given. The average loading dose of mexiletine was 4.4 mg/kg, at an infusion rate of 0.1 mg/kg/min. Ten patients received lidocaine (1 mg/kg) given over 3 minutes, with a second similar bolus given if after 10 minutes greater than or equal to 95% VPD suppression was not achieved. Total VPDs were determined for the 60 minutes before drug administration, during drug infusion, and 60 minutes thereafter. Eleven of 12 (92%) patients receiving mexiletine were full responders (greater than or equal to 95% suppression) and one was a partial responder (greater than or equal to 75% greater than or equal to 95% suppression). Five of 10 lidocaine patients (50%) were full responders, three (30%) were partial responders, and two failed to respond. At peak suppression, mexiletine reduced mean VPD from 37 +/- 33/5 minutes (mean +/- S.D.) to 0.8 +/- 0.9/5 minutes (p less than 0.01) and lidocaine decreased mean VPDs from 28 +/- 47/5 minutes to 4.7 +/- 2.2/5 minutes (p less than 0.01). Mexiletine resulted in greater suppression of VPDs than lidocaine in terms of mean percent reduction (96% vs 68%, p less than 0.01). All lidocaine patients had therapeutic plasma levels (range 1.6 to 3.5 micrograms/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients underwent therapy guided by serial electrophysiologic testing. Of the 47 patients, 19 used the telephone transmitter system and 28 did not. During follow-up, residual symptomatic and silent ventricular arrhythmia was documented in 78% of patients using telephone transmitters. Ventricular tachycardia was transmitted in six patients--all survived. During an average 15-month follow-up, 1 of 19 patients using the telephone transmitter system died vs 12 deaths among the 28 patients who did not use the system (p less than 0.005). These results were independent of ejection fraction, presence of congestive heart failure, amiodarone therapy, and the outcome on electrophysiologic therapy. Thus, patients with a history of out-of-hospital sudden death, discharged following electrophysiologic guided therapy, require repeated antiarrhythmic dose titration for side effects or residual ventricular arrhythmia. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of potentially fatal arrhythmia is crucial and feasible, especially with regular ECG checks through telephone transmission.\r"

To assess whether an antiarrhythmic management program could reduce mortality, we studied 20 consecutive patients with ventricular fibrillation (12) or ventricular tachycardia (eight) and heart failure. Coronary disease was the most common underlying cardiac disorder (85%). Heart failure was managed with digoxin (16), diuretics (16), and vasodilators (seven). All patients received antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by both noninvasive and invasive studies. This included single (10) or combination drug therapy (10). Beta blockers were used alone or in combination for arrhythmia control in 11 patients. One-year survival was 89%. We conclude that an effective program can be developed for patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias and heart failure. Combination antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often required. Despite impaired left ventricular function, beta-blocking drugs can be used, and may be important.\r"

  ".U": "87073121\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy of intravenous cibenzoline (3 mg/kg), propafenone (4 mg/kg), and procainamide (20 mg/kg) against inducible sustained and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias (VT) was evaluated in 12 conscious dogs with chronic isolated right ventricular (RV) infarction. RV infarct was caused by permanent occlusion of the right coronary artery in the closed-chest dog by intracoronary balloon inflation. Three to 10 days following the occlusion period, programmed electrical stimulation reproducibly induced sustained and/or nonsustained VT, allowing evaluation of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy. Propafenone was effective in preventing the induction of sustained VT in only one out of six dogs tested, but caused a significant (p less than 0.05) slowing of VT rate (269 +/- 13 to 230 +/- 10 bpm). Procainamide had effects similar to those seen with propafenone. Propafenone and procainamide were ineffective against nonsustained VT, and on established sustained VT once induced. Cibenzoline was effective in preventing the induction of sustained VT in two out of seven dogs, an effect which was not significantly different from either propafenone or procainamide. However, cibenzoline was significantly (p less than 0.05) more effective than either procainamide or propafenone in terminating an established induced sustained VT (four out of six dogs). Furthermore, cibenzoline converted nonsustained to sustained VT in four out of seven dogs tested. Histopathologic studies have shown infarction of the basal two thirds of the RV (38.5 +/- 7.8% of the RV) with no left ventricular involvement. It is concluded that the isolated RV infarction model is highly suitable for serial drug testing against inducible VT in conscious dogs, and this model of VT appears to be fairly resistant to standard and newer antiarrhythmic drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Although the blood substitute perfluorochemical Fluosol-DA has been shown to reduce experimental myocardial infarct size, the electrophysiologic properties of the surviving myocardium have not been assessed. Twenty-six dogs underwent closed-chest occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Prior to infarction animals were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: groups receiving blood exchange with either Fluosol-DA (F = 9) or autologous heparinized blood (H = 8), given 30 minutes following occlusion over the next 30 minutes (these animals were ventilated with 100% oxygen for 6 hours), or a control group (C = 9) receiving no exchange transfusion and ventilated with room air. On the third postmyocardial infarction day the animals underwent programmed stimulation. The area at risk was defined by injecting different colored microvascular dyes into the three coronary beds, and the area of necrosis was defined by sectioning ventricular slices and staining with Mallory's trichrome stain. Infarct size was significantly reduced in the Fluosol-DA-treated group as compared to the heparin-treated and control groups when expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (F = 53.3 +/- 10, H = 67.2 +/- 12.8, C = 73.6 +/- 11.4: F vs H p less than 0.05; F vs C p less than 0.01). Ventricular tachycardia was inducible and sustained in 16 animals (3F, 6H, and 7C), and there was morphologic correlation with greater endocardial necrosis and smaller viable epicardial regions. In the 10 animals (6F, 2H, and 2C) without sustained ventricular tachycardia, there was greater epicardial viability and sparing of the endocardial regions with irregularity of the borders between viable and necrotic myocardium. We conclude that Fluosol-DA not only decreases infarct size but also modifies infarct morphology to reduce electrical instability.\r"

Eighty-seven percent (403) of the patients were catheterized within one month of the acute event, and were followed for a mean of 43 months (range 21 to 69). Three-vessel disease was present in 96 cases (24%) and these patients form the study population. The primary goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of three-vessel disease and to identify predictors of survival and new coronary events among this subset of infarct survivors. During follow-up, 15 patients died, 17 had a recurrent nonfatal infarction, and 54 developed angina (4-year probability of each cardiac event being 0.20, 0.22, and 0.59, respectively). Cox's stepwise multivariate analysis identified the ejection fraction (EF) as the only predictor of survival (p less than 0.001). No predictors for nonfatal ischemic events were found among the independent variables considered. Patients were stratified in risk categories according to the EF. Four-year probability of survival was 1.0 in participants with EF = greater than 50% (n = 23), 0.77 for those with EF = 21% to 49% (n = 66), and 0.22 in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction, EF = less than 20% (n = 7). Probability of occurrence of nonfatal reinfarction or angina was similar in the three risk categories. Thus, our results indicate that a normal ejection fraction is found in 25% of infarct survivors with three-vessel disease, and that this subset of patients has a low incidence of early and intermediate range coronary events.\r"

Patients with anterior ST depression (n = 33) had depressed mean values for left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 2% [mean +/- S.E.M.] vs 59 +/- 2%; p = 0.02), cardiac index (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs 3.6 +/- 0.2 L/m2; p = 0.03), and ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume (2.0 +/- 0.1 vs 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg/ml; p = 0.04) compared to patients with no anterior ST depression (n = 34). Patients with anterior ST depression had (1) lower mean wall motion values for the inferior, apical, and inferior posterolateral segments (p less than 0.05) and (2) greater reductions in thallium-201 uptake in the inferior and posterolateral regions (p less than 0.05). However, anterior and septal (1) wall motion and (2) thallium-201 uptake were similar in patients with and without ST depression. Thus, anterior precordial ST segment depression in patients with acute inferior wall myocardial infarction represents more than a reciprocal electrical phenomenon. It identifies patients with more severe wall motion impairment and greater hypoperfusion of the inferior and adjacent segments. The poorer global left ventricular function in these patients is a result of more extensive inferior infarction and not of remote septal or anterior injury.\r"

However, underlying coronary stenosis has not been previously demonstrated to be a determinant of the rate of myocardial functional recovery. Thus, 12 open-chest dogs were studied to examine the influence of critical coronary stenosis (CCS) on functional recovery after transient CO. Regional functional recovery following 2-minute CO was examined under two different conditions in eight dogs: patent coronary artery stenosis and fixed CSS that exhausted coronary reserve but did not cause a deficit in resting coronary flow or regional function. Following reperfusion with the coronary artery patent, regional function in the ischemic zone was fully recovered (100 +/- 18.0% of pre-CO value) at 30 seconds and was significantly increased (postischemic hypercontraction) compared to pre-CO value at 1 and at 2 minutes after reperfusion. Following CO and reperfusion in the setting of CCS, regional functional recovery was delayed and regional function remained depressed until 2 minutes after reperfusion. No cumulative effect on functional recovery following repeated 2-minute CO was demonstrated in a control group of four dogs. We conclude that coronary artery patency is a determinant of the rate of myocardial function recovery after a transient ischemic episode, and postischemic hypercontractility was suppressed by the underlying CCS.\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of diltiazem on coronary reactive hyperemia were studied in 12 patients with flow-limiting coronary stenosis. Reactive hyperemia was elicited by injection of 8 ml contrast medium into the left coronary artery, while coronary sinus blood flow and left ventricular and aortic pressures were continuously recorded. Relative magnitude of hyperemia was estimated by the ratio of coronary flow at peak hyperemia to baseline flow (hyperemic ratio). Coronary resistance was calculated as the ratio between mean aortic pressure minus left ventricular mean diastolic pressure and coronary sinus blood flow. The 12 patients studied had flow-limiting coronary stenosis since their hyperemic ratio was significantly restrained when compared to that of seven control subjects (1.45 +/- 0.17 vs 2.02 +/- 0.24, respectively; p less than 0.001). The intravenous infusion of diltiazem (0.30 mg X kg-1) reduced heart rate, mean aortic pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption (all p less than 0.001). After diltiazem the hyperemic ratio was blunted when compared to the basal state (1.36 +/- 0.15 vs 1.45 +/- 0.17, respectively; p less than 0.05), and hyperemia volume was reduced (-33%; p less than 0.001). The decrease in coronary resistance at peak hyperemia was also reduced from -30 +/- 8% to -25 +/- 8% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that diltiazem blunts coronary reactive hyperemia in patients with demonstrated flow-limiting coronary stenosis. This reduction of coronary flow response to a hyperemic stimulus could favorably influence blood flow distribution in patients with significant coronary stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary artery reperfusion following acute myocardial ischemia may salvage ischemic jeopardized cells. We studied the effects of early brief reperfusion on totally ischemic and on partially ischemic myocardium of open-chest pigs. In 10 animals, coronary flow was reduced to 0% for 30 minutes and was followed by 10 minutes reperfusion (group A). In another 10 animals, coronary flow was reduced to 25% of the baseline value for 30 minutes followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion (group B). In another eight animals coronary flow was reduced to 25% of the baseline value for 60 minutes and followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion (group C). Results showed that a brief 10-minute period of reperfusion of ischemic myocardium after total occlusion caused abnormal diastolic wall thickening with only partial return of systolic wall thickening. However, reperfusion of ischemic myocardium after partial occlusion, whether 30 or 60 minutes, caused little diastolic wall thickening and a partial return of systolic thickening. A marked elevation of myocardial Ca2+, a decrease in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and cellular ATP concentration, and a reduction in the rate of Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles occurred in the totally ischemic myocardium but not in the partially ischemic myocardium. These results demonstrate that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium after 1 hour of coronary flow reduction to 25% of baseline is less damaging than reperfusion after a 30-minute total coronary occlusion, and suggest that preexisting states affecting coronary flow need to be evaluated in assessing the outcome of reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed heart size and mechanics at rest in highly trained distance runners. By means of two-dimensional echocardiography, we compared 62 runners (greater than 40 miles/week) and 84 nonrunners. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and mass index were larger in runners than in nonrunners (p less than 0.001) and in men than in women (p less than 0.001). However, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume/mass ratios were similar for runners and nonrunners. Noninvasive estimates of end-systolic and peak-systolic meridional and circumferential wall stresses were lower in runners than in nonrunners (p less than 0.001). Lower wall stress resulted from lower myocardial area/cavity area ratios, and thus 'average' radius/thickness ratios (measured from the parasternal short-axis view), in runners than in nonrunners (p less than 0.001). We detected a subtle change in ventricular shape among the distance runners. Basilar hypertrophy accounted for increased myocardial thickness with normal cavity size in the parasternal short-axis view, as might be expected in hearts working under sustained pressure elevations during prolonged training periods. However, cavity length and therefore ventricular volume were increased in the apical views, leading to a normal overall volume/mass ratio. These hearts have thus adjusted to periods of volume, as well as to pressure overload. Race performance is determined by a complex interaction between the heart, vascular, and skeletal muscle systems. In this study no parameter of myocardial size or function predicted 10 km or marathon race times, just as no physical characteristic or training record predicted left ventricular mass, end-diastolic or end-systolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the documentation of tachycardia in previous studies has been generally based on brief periods of observation. In the present study, we measured heart rates through a 24-hour period in 16 ambulatory mildly hypertensive subjects (ages 5 to 23 years). When compared with normal matched controls, significantly (p less than 0.05) higher heart rates were observed during the waking periods (99 +/- 9 vs 90 +/- 11) and sleep periods (72 +/- 12 vs 62 +/- 7). Similar observations were also made for 24 hours (90 +/- 8 vs 79 +/- 8). In addition, hypertensives also demonstrated thickened (during diastole) left ventricular posterior wall (0.96 +/- 0.17 vs 0.85 +/- 0.13 cm; p less than 0.05) and interventricular septum (0.98 +/- 0.17 vs 0.84 +/- 0.19 cm; p less than 0.05).

Age at operation was 1 to 8 months in seven patients (group I: infant group) and 2 to 9 years in the remaining 11 patients (group II: childhood group). The diagnosis was pulmonary atresia in eight patients, truncus arteriosus in seven, and transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis in three. Porcine-valved conduits were inserted in 17 patients and an aortic homograft in one. All but seven patients were free of symptoms at the time of postoperative study. Neither peak RV pressures nor RV to PA gradients were different between groups. RV ejection fraction (EF) was decreased in group II (0.43 +/- 0.11) but was normal (0.60 +/- 0.10) in group I. In addition, there was a significant inverse relationship between RVEF and age at repair (r = 0.714; p less than 0.005). RV end-diastolic volume (EDV) was normal or increased in all patients and did not differ between the two groups. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was also decreased in the older group (0.56 +/- 0.10 vs 0.68 +/- 0.08; p less than 0.05), and there was a decrease in RVEF and/or LVEF from pre- to postoperative studies in one of six group I patients compared with four of five group II patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten rabbits were treated daily with taurine (100 mg/kg by mouth) and eight with guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) (100 mg/kg by mouth) immediately after induction of aortic regurgitation. The cumulative mortality rate at 8 weeks in the taurine-treated CHF group was 10% (1 of 10) compared with 53% (16 of 30) in the nontreated CHF group and 75% (6 of 8) in the GES-treated CHF group (p less than 0.05). Although cardiac function (max dP/dt) in CHF rabbits was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001), taurine-treated CHF rabbits maintained the same values as control rabbits. Taurine content of the left ventricular tissue of the CHF rabbits was significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Administration of taurine and GES to control rabbits for 8 weeks affected neither the hemodynamics nor the taurine content of the heart. It was concluded that taurine slowed the rapid progression of heart failure and consequently prolonged life expectancy.\r"

The motion of the interventricular septum was abnormal in 41 of 93 patients (44%). Right-sided thrombi were seen in 13 patients within the right pulmonary artery (n = 11) and in the right ventricle (n = 3); in one patient they were found in the superior vena cava, in the innominate vein, and the right atrium. Two patients suffered from right-sided endocarditis. Thus echocardiographic changes were frequently found in patients with proved pulmonary emboli.

To further examine this, we identified 74 patients who were diagnosed as having infective endocarditis over a 54-month period. The 50 patients who underwent 2DE examination form the basis of this report. Definite vegetations were present in 21 (42%) patients and measured 1.2 +/- 0.2 cm2. The vegetation was localized to the aortic valve in 10 patients, the mitral valve in eight, and the tricuspid valve in three. A major complication, defined as death, new-onset congestive heart failure, major arterial embolus, or valve surgery occurred in 86% of the vegetative endocarditis patients compared to 62% of those without vegetations. Among those patients with vegetations, death occurred in 24%, heart failure in 38%, arterial embolus in 48%, and surgery in 43%. This compared to 7%, 21%, 21%, and 24%, respectively, in those patients without vegetations. These data support the concept that 2DE detection of a vegetation defines a high-risk subgroup of patients with infective endocarditis in whom careful monitoring and aggressive management are warranted.\r"

A total of 1046 consecutive autopsies performed between 1981 and 1983 were reviewed, and 210 patients with both premortem and autopsy diagnoses of cancer were found, in whom a recent (less than 3 months before death) ECG was available. Of these patients, 47 had cardiac metastases (group I) and 163 did not (group II). In group I, 19 patients had new ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia or injury, including either diffuse T wave inversion (10%), segmental (ECG pattern suggestive of a specific coronary distribution) T wave inversion (80%), or ST elevation (10%). None of these patients had symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia. In group II, six patients had ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia or injury: four patients with preterminal sepsis, one with myocardial infarction, and one with aspergillus nodules within the myocardium. New atrial arrhythmias (seven patients) and low voltage (10 patients) were found with greater frequency in group I patients (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.00001, respectively, vs group II). Patients with normal ECGs were unlikely to have cardiac metastases; however, the finding of nonspecific ST-T wave changes was not helpful in differentiating the two groups. In clinically stable patients with cancer and no cardiac symptoms suggestive of ischemia, any new ECG change should raise the suspicion of cardiac metastases. The ECG finding of myocardial ischemia or injury has high specificity (96%, p less than 0.000001) for cardiac metastases.\r"

A total of 345 subjects performed GXT and exercise training sessions with either the Bruce treadmill protocol and level ground ambulation (N = 154) or cycle ergometry (N = 191). Responses from 90% of each group were used to generate equations for predicting training pace (or power output) from the time (or power output) during the GXT when target HR was achieved. FAI was also included in the prediction of training pace (or power output). The remaining 10% of subjects in each group were used to cross-validate the prediction equations. The correlation between the time (or power output) during GXT when the training HR was observed and the pace of ambulation (or power output) was 0.70 for treadmill walking and 0.88 for cycle-cycle. Correlations were increased by the addition of FAI to the prediction equation. The results of this investigation suggest that the absolute intensity of exercise for training can be predicted accurately from GXT results.\r"

  ".W": "The antihypertensive efficacy of bevantolol, a selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, was evaluated in 17 patients with essential hypertension, using continuous ambulatory intraarterial blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The study compared a twice-daily regimen (titrated dose of 200 to 600 mg/day) with the same amount given in a single daily dose. Within-patient comparisons of mean hourly systolic and diastolic BPs and heart rate showed a highly significant effect with twice-daily therapy (p less than 0.001) for all of the 24 hours. Similar significant results were obtained with a single morning dose. There was no difference between the pattern or extent of BP reduction with the 2 regimens. The decrease in BP after bevantolol persisted during the physiologic tests (rest, tilt, isometric and dynamic exercise). Four patients developed minor side effects with the single morning dose, and only 1 patient with the twice-daily regimen. These effects included tiredness, fatigue and dizziness. Unlike pure beta-blocking agents, bevantolol controlled the early morning increase in BP, lending support to the belief that it possesses vasodilatory properties in addition to beta blockade. These results suggest that bevantolol may be useful as first-line therapy in a once-daily dosage for the treatment of essential hypertension.\r"

Patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1 had a creatinine clearance of 50 to 80 ml/min, group 2, 20 to 49 ml/min and group 3, less than 20 ml/min. After baseline inulin and paraaminohippuric acid clearance values were obtained, patients were given a single, 150-mg \"priming\" administration of bevantolol. The kinetics of the drug (including plasma drug levels, plasma half-life and plasma clearance) and its effects on renal function were observed for 24 hours. On days 4 to 6 of the study, patients received 150 mg of bevantolol twice daily, with only a single dose given on day 7. Bevantolol did not significantly affect either inulin or paraaminohippuric acid clearance in patients with differing degrees of renal function. In 50% of patients with a creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 50 ml/min, both the half-life and maximum trough serum levels were higher than the ranges seen in healthy subjects. However, neither value appears to be clinically relevant because bevantolol has a wide therapeutic range. Renal impairment did not change the percentages of the bevantolol dosage excreted unchanged or as conjugated drug in the urine, and no toxic or active drug metabolites accumulated in the blood. From these results, it appears that bevantolol may be used safely in short-term therapy of patients with renal impairment.\r"

Patients were then randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with either drug. Patients were evaluated at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks during the drug treatment period. Efficacy measurements were based on sitting and standing BP and heart rate. Adverse experiences were recorded on patient checklists, by spontaneous complaints and by 12-lead electrocardiography and funduscopy. A subgroup of 104 patients had heart rate and BP determinations every 24 to 26 hours after drug ingestion. Overall results showed both drugs to be comparably effective; no real difference was shown after 12 weeks of treatment. Bevantolol caused a more gradual BP decrease than atenolol. Both regimens were associated with decreased heart rate (less marked with bevantolol, p less than 0.001). Data from the 24-hour assessment subgroup showed similar results for both drugs, with a somewhat lower decrease in BP for bevantolol, which persisted throughout the study. Both drugs lowered sitting BP; the decrease was significantly less with bevantolol after the second week of therapy. The mean number of adverse experiences was similar for both drugs; cardiovascular side effects were less frequent with bevantolol. Patients taking bevantolol showed a higher incidence of digestive system side effects. Bevantolol maintained a 24-hour antihypertensive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Given once daily, 200 mg of bevantolol was compared with 200 mg of bevantolol given twice daily and with placebo, using a double-blind crossover technique. The mean exercise time with placebo was 7.4 +/- 0.6 minutes; this increased to 10.6 +/- 0.9 minutes (p less than 0.001) with once-daily bevantolol and to 9.4 +/- 0.9 minutes (p less than 0.001) with twice-daily bevantolol.

The maximum exercise heart rate of 118 +/- 6 beats/min with placebo was reduced to 99 +/- 4 beats/min (p less than 0.001) on once-daily and 101 +/- 4 beats/min (p less than 0.001) on twice-daily bevantolol. There was a corresponding decrease in the rate-pressure product. The corrected maximum ST-segment depression was reduced from 0.3 +/- 0.06 mm min-1 with placebo to 0.2 +/- 0.03 mm min-1 (p less than 0.02) with once-daily and 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm min-1 (p less than 0.05) with twice-daily bevantolol.

  ".W": "Bevantolol is a cardioselective, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, devoid of intrinsic beta sympathomimetic activity and with weak membrane-stabilizing and local anesthetic properties. The 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamino moiety, substituted on the side chain amine function, confers cardioselectivity, which has been confirmed by a number of experiments. In vitro, bevantolol demonstrated greater antagonism of atrial than tracheal responses to isoproterenol. In vivo, bevantolol preferentially inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardias in conscious and anesthetized dogs, compared with the nonselective agent propranolol. Conversely, its effect on blood pressure after isoproterenol was minimal compared with propranolol, reflecting its muted effect on beta 2 peripheral receptors. A functional difference between bevantolol and propranolol was demonstrated in histamine-challenged guinea pigs. Bevantolol had little effect on the antiasthmatic effect of isoproterenol, whereas propranolol blocked it totally. Bevantolol's lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity was demonstrated in normal and reserpinized dogs, where it was devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity at doses up to 10 mg/kg. Similarly, intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg had to be administered before direct myocardial depression occurred in the reserpinized animals. Metabolite 3, which is excreted in trace amounts in human urine, demonstrates intrinsic sympathomimetic activity when administered in pharmacologic doses to dogs; however, any clinical relevance remains to be established. Several laboratories have demonstrated that bevantolol interacts at alpha-adrenergic sites. These data require further investigation. The dose-related antihypertensive effect of bevantolol has been demonstrated in spontaneously hypertensive and 2 kidney, 1 clip renal hypertensive rats. Animal experiments also suggest that bevantolol may be useful in angina: It caused a favorable redistribution of blood flow in dogs in which the left circumflex artery had been stenosed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In doses of 0.5 to 3.0 mg/kg bevantolol caused dose-dependent decreases in cardiac output (10% to 35%), primarily due to negative chronotropic actions, as heart rate decreased by 10% to 25%. Stroke volume decreased after the highest dose (15%), due to a negative inotropic action (maximum left ventricular dP/dt decreased by 40%) and a mild vasoconstriction in systemic vascular beds. Decreases in perfusion of the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, stomach, muscles and adrenals were similar to those in cardiac output. However, blood flow to the brain and small intestine was not significantly affected. Bevantolol (0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg IV) gave full protection against ventricular fibrillation during the first period (10 minutes) of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion in the highest dose. After the third and last reperfusion period, 70% of these animals survived, while only 8% of the untreated and 15% of the animals treated with the lower dose survived. After permanent ligation of the LAD coronary artery at midpoint, bevantolol prevented ventricular fibrillation during the first phase of early ventricular arrhythmias but was unable to prevent it during the second phase of early arrhythmias. Administration of bevantolol (1.5 mg/kg) to animals in which the LAD coronary artery blood flow was reduced to 35% of baseline did not improve transmural myocardial blood flow to the ischemic zone. However, the drug caused a redistribution in favor of the endocardial layers. The changes in flow were accompanied by a narrowing of the arterial-coronary venous differences in pH and pCO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 24-hour continuous electrocardiographic recording was made 11 +/- 3 days after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 820 of the 867 participants in the Multicenter Post-Infarction Program. Ninety patients (11%) had unsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2 (0.2%) had sustained VT (more than 15 seconds). In 53 of the 92 patients (58%) with VT, only 1 episode of VT was in the recording. In 26 patients the longest episode of VT was 3 consecutive complexes (28%); in 56 patients (61%) it was 4 to 10 complexes; and in only 10 patients (11%) were there more than 10 consecutive complexes. The average rate of VT was 121 +/- 34 complexes per minute (range 75 to 240). Most episodes of VT started well after the T wave. Occurrence of VT was strongly related to the frequency of ventricular premature complexes in the 24-hour recording; 46% of the patients with at least 100 ventricular premature complexes per hour had VT. The 92 patients who had VT were compared to the 728 who did not with respect to relevant clinical characteristics. Several variables were significantly (p less than 0.05) more common in the VT group: age older than 60 years, previous AMI, history of angina pectoris, occurrence of VT or ventricular fibrillation in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%, rales greater than bibasilar in the coronary care unit, and use of antiarrhythmic drugs, digitalis or diuretics at the time of discharge from hospital. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the cumulative probability of surviving 3 years was 0.67 for patients with VT and 0.85 for patients without VT (p less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant associations between individual VT characteristics and mortality. However, patients with longer runs of VT tended to have a higher mortality rate, and both patients with sustained VT died in the first month after the index infarct. VT had a strong and statistically significant association (p less than 0.05) with all-cause and arrhythmic mortality independent of other risk variables that were associated with VT. Adjusted for other risk indicators, VT nearly doubled the risk of dying during an average follow-up of 31 months.\r"

Of 4 patients in whom recanalization failed with intracoronary streptokinase given first (group B), 2 had successful recanalization after addition of intracoronary PGE1. Immediately after successful recanalization, left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 50 +/- 9% to 62 +/- 10% (p less than 0.0008), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 20 +/- 10 to 16 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and stroke volume index increased from 34 +/- 10 to 44 +/- 12 ml/m2 (p less than 0.02).

Thus, intracoronary infusion of PGE1 was effective in establishing reperfusion in all patients when followed by streptokinase and was associated with immediately improved left ventricular global and regional function. PGE1 deserves further evaluation in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Exercise testing was considered positive when more than 1 mm of ST depression occurred 80 ms after the J point. Dobutamine stress testing was well tolerated; no complications and no significant arrhythmia were observed. Echocardiographic recordings were adequate in all patients during the entire test; the concordance in interpretation between the 2 observers was perfect for the prediction and location of ischemic segments during dobutamine infusion. In 15 of 17 patients without multivessel CAD, no asynergy was observed outside the infarct zone during dobutamine infusion (specificity 88%). In 11 of 13 patients with multivessel CAD, new wall motion abnormalities were identified in the segments corresponding to the arterial lesions diagnosed by angiography (sensitivity 85%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three radionuclide angiographic patterns were recognized in patients with non-Q infarction: no wall motion abnormalities (n = 8), single-segment wall motion abnormalities (n = 10) and multiple-segment wall motion abnormalities (n = 9). In contrast, only 2 radionuclide angiographic patterns were identified in patients with Q-wave infarction: multiple-segment wall motion abnormalities (n = 25) and single-segment wall motion abnormalities (n = 4). The Q-wave distributions of 14 of 18 patients with non-Q infarction with 0 or 1 wall motion abnormalities were normal; 2 patients had \"missed\" anterior; 1 patient had inferior; and 1 had posterior AMI patterns. Of 9 patients with non-Q infarction who had multiple-segment wall motion abnormalities, 8 had infarct Q waves on the posterior torso. Q-wave patterns in patients with anterior (n = 17) and inferior (n = 12) Q-wave infarctions were typical and homogeneous for each group. Quantitative analysis of minimum Q-zone integral, sigma Q-wave integrals, ST-integral maximum, wall motion abnormality score and ejection fraction revealed no differences between patients with non-Q-wave and those with inferior Q-wave infarction. In contrast, patients with anterior AMI had significantly more abnormal values of all variables than either of the other groups. Overall, the data support the concept of non-Q-wave AMI as a distinct, if heterogeneous, pathophysiologic entity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with patients with significant CAD, these patients had a lower frequency of traditional cardiac risk factors and abnormalities on the rest and exercise electrocardiogram. Cardiac survival was 99% at 5 years of follow-up and 98% at 10 years for patients with normal or insignificantly narrowed coronary arteries. Patients with normal coronary arteries differed from those with insignificant CAD in their myocardial infarction free survival rate: 99% at 5 years and 98% at 10 years for patients with normal coronary arteries, compared with 97% at 5 years and 90% at 10 years for patients with insignificant CAD. A strong relation occurred between the amount of insignificant CAD and follow-up cardiac events (chi 2 = 21.5, p less than 0.0001). Cardiac risk factors were statistically related to the risk of follow-up cardiovascular events when considered alone (chi 2 = 4.93, p = 0.026), but this relation lost significance after adjusting for the effect of coronary anatomy. Patients in both groups continued to have cardiac symptoms that resulted in frequent hospitalizations, medication use and job disability. Almost 50% in any given year of follow-up could not perform activities of high metabolic equivalent requirement and 70% had continuing symptoms of chest discomfort. Although these patients are at low risk of death, many remain functionally impaired for years.\r"

Heart rate increased as mean aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased in all patients. Cardiac output increased significantly, from 5.8 +/- 0.3 to 7.9 +/- 0.5 liters/min, 10 minutes after nisoldipine infusion. These trends were maintained over the 30-minute observation period. Coronary sinus blood flow increased from 103 +/- 11 to 139 +/- 13 ml/min immediately after nisoldipine, but had returned to the control level by 30 minutes, as had the reduction in coronary vascular resistance. Myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate-systolic blood pressure product did not change significantly. Nisoldipine is a potent peripheral and coronary vasodilator free of major myocardial depressant effects after acute intravenous administration. The systemic vasodilatory effects appear to outlast the coronary effects over 30 minutes.\r"

The aortic (36%) and mitral (33%) valves were most frequently involved, but in 21% of the cases the site of infection could not be localized. Streptococcal (50%) and staphylococcal (35%) species were the most frequently isolated pathogens. New or changing (\"unstable\") conduction abnormalities developed in 9% of the patients, while an additional 7% had conduction abnormalities of \"indeterminate\" age. Unstable conduction block was more likely to develop in patients with aortic valve infective endocarditis than in those with mitral infection. Surgery was performed in 23% of the patients. Unstable conduction abnormalities were significantly associated with valve replacement, but in a multivariate analysis, this effect could be explained by the site of valvular infection. The mortality rate was 20%. Patients with unstable conduction abnormalities had a significantly higher mortality rate, even after other significant predictors of death (age, type of causative organism) were taken into account. Patients whose conduction changes persisted had a worse prognosis than those with transient conduction abnormalities. Although more hemodynamically compromised, patients with unstable conduction block who underwent valve replacement did at least as well as those given medical therapy alone. Patients with native valve active infective endocarditis in whom persistent, unstable conduction abnormalities develop without other identifiable cause, especially in the presence of aortic valve infection, should be considered for valve replacement.\r"

Whereas LV filling normally occurs in 3 phases, in MS it is more uniform. Thus, in 13 patients the filling ratio was below the normal range of 2.21 to 2.88 (p less than 0.001). In 11 patients in atrial fibrillation, filling ratio divided by mean cardiac cycle length and by LV ejection fraction provided good correlation (r = 0.85) with modified Gorlin formula derived mitral area and excellent correlation with echocardiographic mitral area (r = 0.95). Significant MS can be detected using radionuclide angiocardiography to calculate filling ratio. In the absence of the confounding influence of atrial systole calculation of 0.14 (filling ratio divided by cardiac cycle length divided by LV ejection fraction) + 0.40 cm2 enables accurate prediction of mitral area (+/- 4%). Our data support the contention that the modified Gorlin formula, based on steady-state hemodynamics, provides less certain estimates of mitral area for patients with MS and atrial fibrillation, in whom echocardiography and radionuclide angiocardiography may be more accurate.\r"

Two types of excrescences, lamellar and filiform, were found. Lamellar excrescences are located along the lower boundary of the lunulas and occurred more often in those younger than 30 years. Filiform excrescences appear most often in the nodulus Arantius and in the free-margin of the cusps. The excrescences of the nodulus are the most numerous. Free-margin excrescences are the least numerous and occur more frequently in persons older than 40 years. The connective tissue core of the filiform excrescences contains abundant collagen fibrils and elastic material arranged in apposed layers with different collagen fibril orientation. A circular zone devoid of identifiable connective tissue is present at the center of the filiform excrescences.\r"

The pathologic anatomy was investigated by first fixing postmortem heart specimens in such a way as to preserve the 3-D relations. Next, a technique for postmortem 2-D echocardiography was developed to aid in selection of tomographic planes for sectioning the specimens. Subsequent adjustment of planes of section was made to better show particular facets of the anatomy. The material for this investigation was drawn from cases of hypoplastic left heart syndrome after surgical palliation by the Norwood procedure. Three potential hemodynamic sequelae--restrictive inter atrial communication, aortic obstruction at any level and distortion of the pulmonary artery confluence--served as the anatomic focus for this study. Careful preservation of 3-D topology and postmortem 2-D echocardiographic imaging coupled with tomographic sectioning of specimens led to development of new, clinically relevant echocardiographic views for imaging specific atrial septal and aortic arch anomalies. These techniques offer insight into the spectrum of anatomic sequelae of this type of surgery and may be applied to echocardiographic imaging of patients and refinement of surgical technique for other forms of complex congenital heart disease.\r"

In 30 children who had undergone balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV), QTc intervals were measured on standard electrocardiograms recorded before and 16 to 24 hours after the procedure and at follow-up during the next 1 to 15 months (mean 7). The QTc interval increased from 0.380 +/- 0.027 second before BPV to 0.429 +/- 0.027 second after BPV (p less than 0.002) and returned to 0.377 +/- 0.026 second at follow-up. To determine when during the catheterization-dilation procedure the QTc interval increased, QTc intervals were measured on monitor electrocardiograms recorded during cardiac catheterization. The baseline QTc was 0.382 +/- 0.041 second, was unchanged after angiography and increased to 0.427 +/- 0.043 second after BPV (p less than 0.002). A similar prolongation occurred in 3 of 4 children who had undergone balloon aortic valvuloplasty and in 4 of 5 who had undergone coarctation angioplasty. In control children, who had undergone catheterization without dilation, QTc was unchanged. Thus, transient increases in QTc interval occur after semilunar valvuloplasty and coarctation angioplasty. These dilation procedures are a cause of QTc prolongation; however, the mechanism is unknown. It is possible that the sudden unilateral increase in afterload affects the myocardium or myocardial sympathetic receptors. Because QTc prolongation may predispose children to the R-on-T phenomenon, postprocedure monitoring appears to be warranted.\r"

A control group of 7 children undergoing cardiovascular procedures without extracorporeal circulation or circulatory arrest also were studied.

The half-time of CK-BB differed significantly from that of CK-MB (149 +/- 15 vs 359 +/- 20 minutes).

  ".W": "Nineteen patients with syndrome X (typical exertional angina, positive exercise test response [at least 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression], no evidence of coronary spasm and angiographically normal coronary arteries) underwent continuous 48-hour electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring during unrestricted daily life. Fifty-eight ischemic episodes of at least 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression were observed in the same ECG leads that showed ST depression during stress testing: 28 (48%) were accompanied by anginal pain and 30 (52%) were asymptomatic. No significant differences were found between painful and silent ST-segment depression with regard to the number of episodes, their temporal distribution, magnitude, duration or heart rate (HR) at onset of ST-segment depression. In the minute preceding ischemic ST shifts, HR did not change in 33% of episodes or increased by less than 10 beats/min in 28%. HR at onset of ST depression was significantly lower during ambulatory ECG monitoring than during exercise testing (98 +/- 18 vs 117 +/- 18 beats/min, p less than 0.01). During ambulatory monitoring, 85 episodes of sinus tachycardia (exceeding by 10 to 80 beats/min the HR that triggered ischemia during exercise testing) occurred in the absence of angina or ST-segment shifts. The results of this study suggest that in patients with syndrome X, myocardial ischemia frequently develops during daily life; silent ischemia is an important component of this syndrome; and increased oxygen demand in the presence of impaired coronary vasodilatory capacity is not the only cause of myocardial ischemia. Active mechanisms that transiently reduce coronary flow may act and explain occurrence of angina at rest and with minimal exertion.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relation of echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) mass to reported physical activity, 2 groups of subjects with widely different physical activity levels were evaluated: 50 men with spinal cord injuries and 166 apparently healthy, active men. Multivariate analysis revealed that reported physical activity was a significant independent predictor of LV mass index (LV mass/body surface area) in both injured patients and healthy, active subjects after controlling for age and blood pressure. The relation between LV mass index and physical activity (linear regression) was similar for both groups; LV mass index = 0.00321 (physical activity) + 82.8 and LV mass index = 0.00335 (physical activity) +88.4 for patients and healthy active subjects, respectively. These results suggest that physical activity as assessed by self-report is associated with echocardiographically detectable differences in LV mass in groups with widely divergent physical activity levels. In addition, for each of these groups 1,000 kcal/week of physical activity apparently results in a change of approximately 3 g/m2 in LV mass index. This information may have practical use for correction of LV mass for the effects of physical activity.\r"

  ".W": "Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and asymmetric septal hypertrophy have both been described in weight lifters, but diastolic filling, which is abnormal in pathologically hypertrophied ventricles, has not been investigated in such subjects. Accordingly, pulsed Doppler examination of LV inflow, M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography were performed in 16 competitive weight lifters and 10 age-matched male control subjects. Peak and mean filling rates were determined in milliliters per second as the product of the cross-sectional area of the mitral anulus and the Doppler-derived peak early and mean transmitral inflow velocities, respectively. Rapid filling index was defined as peak filling rate divided by mean filling rate. Flow velocity integrals of the early and atrial diastolic filling phases were also measured. LV end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction were measured using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Weight lifters had significantly higher LV end-diastolic volume (181 +/- 50 vs 136 +/- 40 ml, p less than 0.05) and dimension (5.6 +/- 0.6 vs 5.1 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.05), and posterior wall thickness (0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 0.8 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05); however, after correction for body surface area there was no significant difference in these values. Weight lifters had significantly higher LV mass (241 +/- 70 vs 165 +/- 29, p less than 0.02) and LV mass index (114 +/- 29 vs 87 +/- 15 g/m2, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between the weight lifters and control subjects in rapid filling index, early to late integral ratio or ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects were treated according to a randomized, single-blind, crossover design with 150 mg of dipyridamole, 25 mg of ASA, the 2 drugs together or placebo twice a day for 3 days. Platelet adhesin was evaluated using an experimental model of adhesion to rat aorta subendothelium under controlled hemodynamic conditions in the presence of red blood cells. Dipyridamole significantly reduced platelet adhesion both alone and in combination with ASA. ASA by itself did not significantly modify platelet adhesion, but completely blocked serum thromboxane production and platelet aggregation by arachidonic acid. Thus, low-dose ASA and dipyridamole may have a complementary action, modifying at the same time 2 platelet functions, adhesion and aggregation, both relevant in the pathogenesis of thrombosis.\r"

The 6-mo and 15-mo exercising rats significantly increased their food intake in response to the training stimulus; the 27-mo trained animals were unable to increase their food consumption relative to controls. It was concluded that 27-mo old animals are capable of changes in body composition similar to those of their younger counterparts, however, physiological mechanisms responsible for these shifts are age dependent. Older animals do not compensate their dietary intake for the increased energy expenditure of exercise as do the younger animals.\r"

Carbohydrate cravers consume most or all snacks as carbohydrate-rich foods despite the equal accessibility of protein-rich snacks. Noncarbohydrate cravers consume about equal amounts of protein- and carbohydrate-rich snack foods. Using standardized self-report questionnaires, we measured mood before and 2 h after consumption of a high-carbohydrate lunch (104 g CHO). Responses to the meal differed significantly: noncarbohydrate cravers reported feeling considerably less alert, more fatigued and sleepy, while carbohydrate cravers described little or no change in these aspects of mood. Moreover, noncarbohydrate cravers experienced an increase in depression, while carbohydrate cravers reported feeling less depressed. Findings suggest that snacking habits of obese individuals may be related to subsequent mood states.\r"

In this study on a population of French children, no correlation was found between energy intake and individual corpulence (wt/ht2 index or skinfold thickness), but a higher proportion of overweight children was found in lower social classes where energy intake is traditionally higher. A hypothesis is proposed to account for this apparent contradiction: the typical lifestyle or diet in a given population challenges individual adaptive capacities; the more caloric the socially accepted diet, the higher the proportion of individuals who are challenged beyond their adaptive threshold. Socially determined factors such as a high calorie diet act in a permissive way in the development of obesity although the caloric intake of obese individuals may be no different from that of nonobese peers.\r"

Serum concentrations of smaller-LDL particles were also positively correlated with dietary-cholesterol intake and negatively correlated with crude-fiber consumption.

Due to high-fat diet feeding, erythrocyte membrane and leucocyte cholesterol and phospholipid contents were increased, cholesterol:phospholipid molar ratio was elevated, and erythrocyte enzymes (G6PD and 6PGD) and leucocyte enzymes (CEH and CES) were elevated. Erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein components showed marked increase, indicating possible alterations of membrane surfaces. The metabolic alterations were reversed slowly after resumption of the normal (low-fat) diet. Body weight plays an important role in the alterations in major lipoprotein cholesterol contents in response to changes in dietary fat composition. Cellular changes indicate alterations in structure and function of blood cells due to high-fat diet feeding.\r"

BCKA and gluconeogenic amino acids were liberated by peripheral tissues whereas BCAA were not. By analogy with the fate of alanine, a reduction in plasma BCKA associated with a high release by peripheral tissues might involve an increase in their hepatic metabolism. The BCKA would then give rise to ketone bodies used by the peripheral tissue. This step would complete the glucose-alanine cycle described by Cahill in hypercatabolic states where energy requirements are intense and similar to those found in burn injuries.\r"

Low-KICA diets reduced plasma-leucine level; higher KICA diets normalized plasma leucine and revealed branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) antagonism.

Bactericidal capacity was severely impaired prior to treatment. After 3-5 days of ferrous sulfate administration, there was no significant improvement. At day 15 it returned to normal ranges and remained so at days 30 and 90.

Results show that, in both the calcium- and placebo-supplemented groups, blood pressure values decreased slightly and no effect of oral-calcium supplementation on blood pressure could be demonstrated. In addition, at baseline neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure correlated with habitual calcium intake. Diastolic but not systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with body mass index (r = 0.31, p = 0.01).

Throughout hospitalization, mean serum-copper concentration was significantly depressed; lowest levels were found in patients with greater than 40% total body surface area burns. Serum ceruloplasmin was also depressed, an unexpected finding because this protein is a positive acute-phase reactant poststress. Mean urinary excretion of copper was elevated, reaching 2.5 times the upper limit of normal 2 wk postburn. Depressed serum-copper levels paralleled the serum-ceruloplasmin levels rather than the increased urinary-copper losses. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism(s) of this altered copper metabolism and whether physiological or biochemical evidence of copper deficiency accompanies the observed hypocupremia.\r"

Following bile duct ligation in one rat, TPGS promoted the absorption of alpha-tocopherol while absorption of gamma-tocopherol from soybean oil was decreased 30 fold, demonstrating that TPGS, which forms a micellar solution, delivers alpha-tocopherol through the unstirred water layer to enterocytes, while free tocopherol (alpha or gamma) absorption requires the presence of bile salts.\r"

Most of the children showed weight loss and serum proteins decrease during the acute stage of measles. Corneal lesions were observed in 3% of the children, and the lesions responded well to treatment. Serum vitamin A and RBP levels were significantly depressed during the acute stage of measles but were restored to normal 8 wk after recovery. There were no significant differences in the serum levels for those with and without eye lesions, which suggests that these lesions may not be mediated simply through the effect of infection on serum concentration of vitamin A.\r"

Low hemoglobin values were identified in 4.3%, low hematocrit in 6.9%, and elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin in 6.0% of children. The prevalence of elevated EP was significantly higher among Southeast Asian children than non-Southeast Asians and likely was due to iron deficiency.

Premenopausal Caucasians had 30-75% higher plasma estrone and estradiol levels than their age-matched cohorts in Hawaii, and the postmenopausal Caucasians had 3-fold higher plasma levels of estradiol. The Oriental women excreted more than twice the amount of estrogen in their feces but they excreted significantly less in their urine. Thus, the ratio of urinary-to-fecal excretion was approximately 3-5 times higher in young Caucasian women. Analysis of dietary components and plasma estrogens in premenopausal women showed a positive correlation between daily intake of total fat and saturated fat and plasma estrone and estradiol concentrations.\r"

During 48 h culture, increasing glucose alone or beta-hydroxybutyrate alone effected growth retardation and faulty neural and extraneural organogenesis in dose-dependent fashion. Synergistic dysmorphogenic effects occurred when minimally teratogenic concentrations of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate were combined. Sera from diabetic animals containing somatomedin inhibitor bioactivity were also able to produce growth retardation and major developmental lesions in presence of amounts of glucose and ketones which of themselves were not teratogenic. Thus, aberrant fuels and fuel-related products can impair growth and organogenesis in early post-implantation embryo. Such fuel-mediated teratogenesis may be multifactorial and include possibilities for synergistic and additive interactions.\r"

A variety of monoclonal anti-IgA-subclass reagents were applied, which proved to be specific in control experiments on blastoid cells generated by pokeweed mitogen stimulation of blood mononuclear cells and frozen tissue sections of normal jejunum. IgA1 is the major component in IgA deposits in liver (n = 83) and skin (n = 31) of patients with liver disease. Macromolecular IgA is detectable in only one-fifth of the cases. The authors' data do not indicate that hepatic IgA deposits in liver disease are of gastrointestinal origin.

The QMU reported significantly (P less than 0.001) more casts than the IUW method. This difference is related to at least a ninefold greater volume of untreated urine examined by the QMU method than the IUW method. The IUW method may provide a more accurate result than the QMU method at very low and high concentrations of particulate analytes. The result from 24 blind duplicate urines also analyzed by each of the three technologists with both methods showed comparable precision for particulate analytes between the two methods except for red blood cells; the QMU method had significantly (P less than 0.001) better precision for this analyte.\r"

MBO worked best with one- to two-year-long projects involving problem solving and innovation. The author expects maturity of his MBO application within three years. He recommends MBO for other academic medical center laboratories, provided executive management commits the necessary time and resources to install MBO carefully as a relatively loose, locally administered form of management philosophy, rather than management technology.\r"

Correlation with manual differential lymphocyte, mononuclear, and granulocyte percentages was 0.91, 0.54, and 0.94, respectively.

With the use of a combination of S-Plus V-generated flags and preset laboratory criteria, only 9% of abnormal manual differentials would have been undetected. Three-fourths of these undetected cases involved low-frequency abnormalities of questionable clinical significance.

A presumptive diagnosis of parathyroid cyst was made when characteristic water-clear fluid was aspirated. The diagnosis was then confirmed by parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay. The authors believe that the C-terminal/midmolecule determination should be the assay of choice, because the N-terminal-specific assay gave normal or slightly elevated results in all the cases studied. If only an N-terminal-specific PTH assay is obtained, potential for a false negative diagnosis exists. With a correct PTH assay, a specific diagnosis of parathyroid cyst can be rendered, which enables appropriate treatment of total fluid aspiration, which thereby eliminates the need for thyroid hormone treatment or surgery in most cases. A discussion of PTH assays is presented along with speculations concerning the secretion of PTH by the parathyroid gland. The previous literature detailing cytologic findings and the PTH assays of parathyroid cysts diagnosed by the fine-needle aspiration biopsy are reviewed.\r"

Concentrations of ADB were determined immunochemically in serial urine specimens from 12 children who were receiving chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors. There was no indication of increased ADB excretion after administration of two nonnephrotoxic drugs, etoposide and doxorubicin, but in patients given the recognized nephrotoxins, cisplatin and methotrexate, or an investigational drug, ifosfamide, urinary concentrations of ADB increased greater than fivefold relative to baseline values. Increased ADB concentrations preceded cisplatin- or ifosfamide-induced elevations of serum creatinine. Results of the ADB assay correlated well with those obtained by enzymatic assays for N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alanine aminopeptidase (r = 0.76 and 0.53; n = 142, P less than 0.001) and marginally with total proteinuria (r = 0.21; P less than 0.02). Hence, serial ADB measurements may be useful in screening investigational drugs for acute subclinical nephrotoxicity.\r"

Of the 186 samples containing dysmorphic erythrocytes, 55% had pathologic casts, 42% had proteinuria, 71% had RTCs, and 13% had no other abnormality. Renal hematuria can best be evaluated by examination of all four of these urinalysis abnormalities rather than using a single entity for diagnosis. Patients with urinalysis evidence of renal hematuria should be evaluated further for renal disease rather than lower urinary tract disorders.\r"

Electron microscopic examination revealed splitting and thinning of the GBM. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that there was no binding of Goodpasture's anti-GBM antibodies to the glomeruli. These findings are similar to those in patients with hereditary nephritis. The immunofluorescent examination of the fixation of the various anti-sera, including anti-types IV and V collagens, laminin, fibronectin, and actomyosin sera on the GBM, revealed normal reactivity.

Marked developmental delay (Bayley Mental Developmental Index, less than 70) or gross motor abnormality occurred in 2% of controls, 27% of VLBW infants, 33% of ventilator-treated infants, and 39% of ventilator-treated VLBW infants. Despite considerable effort to prevent attrition, 43% of high-risk survivors were unavailable for follow-up at the one-year visit. Even if all of these infants were assumed to be normal, the incidence of developmental delay exceeded that in 11 of 12 recent studies. Indigent high-risk infants deserve considerable follow-up attention because of their high rate of attrition and developmental delay.\r"

With a mean (+/- SD) follow-up period of 42.0 +/- 5.4 months after calcitriol had been administered for at least 12 months, the growth measurements were as follows: the percentile weight (mean +/- SD) remained unchanged, with the initial being 12.3% +/- 17.3% and the final being 15.3% +/- 18.6%, and the length/height percentiles were -2.7% +/- 5.9% and -2.4% +/- 4.4%. The growth velocity index showed a significant improvement from mean values of 61.7% (at age 2 years) to mean values of 101.2% (at age 11.2 years). Serum phosphate concentrations rose from the initial value of 2.9 +/- 0.6 to 3.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dL (0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L). The effects of calcitriol on renal function were tested by creatinine clearance values, which were 127 +/- 22 mL/min/1.73 m2 (2.12 +/- 0.37 mL/s/1.73 m2) at the conclusion of the study, compared with 128 +/- 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 (2.13 +/- 0.41 mL/s/1.73 m2) obtained at the initiation of calcitriol therapy. We conclude that calcitriol treatment of renal hypophosphatemic rickets in children results in improvement of growth velocity and serum phosphate concentration without deterioration of renal function.\r"

A 42-item questionnaire was administered to two patient populations: 97 youths from a drug abuse treatment program and 206 youths from a private pediatric practice. The questionnaire successfully discriminated between the two samples and appears capable of discriminating drug and alcohol risk within the samples. This research suggests that a simple paper-and-pencil questionnaire can successfully discriminate the degree of risk of substance abuse in adolescent patient populations and that such an instrument can be successfully integrated into the routine activities of pediatric practice.\r"

We analyzed prospectively collected pregnancy, perinatal, and subsequent developmental data for 19,117 children. As expected, sociohereditary and demographic factors had a large influence on IQ scores. Taking these latter influences into consideration, nothing that happened during labor, delivery, or the neonatal period affected subsequent IQ values. The same was true for early pregnancy disorders that can produce acute fetal hypoxia. By contrast, antenatal disorders and conditions that can produce subacute or chronic fetal hypoxia correlated with low IQ values. These antenatal disorders and conditions were maternal gestational anemia, relative gestational hypotension, hypertension, multiple births, and fetal growth retardation. All of these findings were the same whether neurologic abnormalities were absent or present, suggesting that the same factors were sometimes involved in the genesis of cognitive impairments and neurologic abnormalities.\r"

Periodic assessments of health and function yielded profiles of concerns. Over the first five years of life, 39% of the children had health concerns, 20% had cognitive concerns, 25% had motor concerns, 15% had social adjustment problems, and 12% had early attentional problems. Children at the highest risk of having reading and behavioral problems in second grade were those with early attentional disability. At the second-grade level, 31% of the children with early attention concerns were one full grade behind in reading and 38% had behavioral problems; among the youngsters without early attentional concerns, 6% demonstrated a reading delay and 8% had behavioral problems. In addition, children of highly educated mothers were more likely to benefit from the multidisciplinary program than were children of less educated mothers, for whom the intervention effected only a modest improvement when contrasted with randomly selected comparison children. For instance, among children with early cognitive problems and whose mothers had little education, 31% of these children had reading problems in second grade as opposed to 10% of those whose mothers had high educational attainment. Similarly, 39% of children with the combined risks of low maternal education and early attentional problems had reading problems in second grade compared with none of the attention-problem children of highly educated mothers. This study shows that while early identification of health and developmental problems can be carried out in a community-based project, strategies for the early intervention of developmental concerns among children of low socioeconomic status remain less than completely effective.\r"

By contrast, for infants who were born at term and of normal birth weight, mortality rates did not differ by level of perinatal care available at the hospital of birth. On the average, preterm and low-birth-weight infants were at a 24% higher risk of death if birth occurred outside of a level 3 center, regardless of whether birth occurred at a level 1 or level 2 hospital. Preterm and low-birth-weight infants, though constituting only 12% of births, accounted for 70% of neonatal deaths in New York City. The remaining infants, ie, those born at term and of normal birth weight, who experienced no measurable mortality advantage when born in a level 3 hospital, accounted for 88% of all births.\r"

He was initially treated with subcutaneous vasopressin injection but was switched to therapy with desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) before discharge. Because of his abnormal nasopharyngeal anatomy, we decided to administer the desmopressin acetate sublingually, and this was effective. A single daily dose of 2 micrograms (0.4 microgram/kg) resulted in a prompt antidiuresis, and the effect gradually lessened over a 24-hour period. Serum electrolyte values were restored to normal and have remained normal after three months of treatment. After additional study, the sublingual route might be considered for the administration of small-polypeptide therapeutic agents when other routes are impractical.\r"

Biventricular heart function was studied by multigated radionuclide angiography in 22 patients with beta-thalassemia major. Six patients were symptomatic. Congestive heart failure developed in five patients at the time of blood transfusions, and one other patient had been treated for multiple ventricular extrasystole. The mean (+/- SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was normal (63.0% +/- 7.6%). Only one patient had a left ventricular ejection fraction under the normal level (less than 50%). The mean (+/- SD) right ventricular fraction (RVEF) was 33.3% +/- 9.4%. In only three patients was the RVEF normal (greater than or equal to 40%); an RVEF under 30% was registered in six patients. We suggest that the early right ventricular dysfunction in patients with beta-thalassemia may be due to pulmonary hypertension secondary to iron overload and iron deposits in the ventricles.\r"

Patients in groups 1 and 2 required lower dosages and blood levels of theophylline to control their apnea than did those in group 3, who required higher dosages and blood levels of methylxanthines. Theophylline dosages and blood levels did not significantly differ between groups 1 and 2. In group 3, the theophylline requirement for control of apnea was significantly increased after initiation of phenobarbital therapy. There seems to be a direct correlation between the increased requirement for theophylline and concomitant phenobarbital administration. The data suggest that phenobarbital increases theophylline requirement when treating neonatal apnea.\r"

Nail guns are relatively new industrial tools that can produce severe or fatal injuries. The configuration of the nail on patients' radiographs after such injuries can be helpful in determining the cause of injury. Steel nails that are bent are due to a ricochet and thus indicate accidental injury. Straight-nail injuries to the co-workers of nail-gun users are most likely due to over-penetration of the substance being nailed or accidental mid-air firing; however, intentional injury cannot be ruled out. Extremity injuries caused by straight steel nails in nail gun users are the result of carelessness or poor technique, but suicide should be considered when straight nails cause wounds to the chest, head, or abdomen.\r"

Nevertheless, in 10 of 59 cases, the cause of death was completely different from the determined in the autopsy performed abroad or assumed from the information available.

The common clinical features were right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevation of the serum transaminases. Jaundice occasionally developed. These occurred in severe preeclampsia or eclampsia and their cause was usually recognized. However, hepatic symptoms and signs did result in inappropriate diagnoses and misdirected therapy. Such confusion occurred when these were the initial problems confronting the clinician in women presenting with advanced toxemia due to poor prenatal care. They were also likely to be misleading when other more classic parameters, such as blood pressure and proteinuria, were only midly abnormal. Central nervous system complications were the common cause of death but liver disease could be partially or wholly responsible. Extensive periportal lesions, hepatic hematomas, spontaneous rupture, and infarction all contributed to hepatic injury and to morbidity. Fibrin deposition, hemorrhage, or both in the periportal areas was characteristic of the histopathology. Scanning electron microscopy validated this spectrum of change. A toxemic vasculopathy related to severe vasospasm in the hepatic arterial circulation may be responsible.\r"

CRP resulted in decreased total sulfur and inorganic sulfate excretions. Although the nutritional therapy per se accentuated these results, a reduced ability to convert SAAs to inorganic sulfate was seen during the whole investigation. Initially, CRP patients showed a raised serum concentration of inorganic sulfate, implicating an altered renal handling of the compound. Increased outputs of SAAs, N-acetylcysteine and mercaptolactate were seen in CRP patients parallel to a raised leukocyte methionine level, probably a consequence of the catabolic state and a limited utilization of SAAs. During therapy a normalization was achieved. Reduced total and free glutathione concentrations in leukocytes were found in CRP, and it was more pronounced for the free form. This result could be due to a reduced synthesis and increased intracellular oxidation of glutathione as a result of the decrease in ethanol.\r"

It was concluded that: A consistent pattern of Ca++ uptake and resultant functional changes are attributable to the interactions of Ca++ with mitochondria during their isolation, unless specific measures are taken to prevent these interactions. The simplest approach to prevent in vitro Ca++ from occurring during isolation of mitochondria from injured tissues having high Ca++ levels is to include ruthenium red in the homogenizing solution used to prepare the mitochondria, although this will still permit some surface binding of Ca++ to mitochondria. By comparing mitochondrial Ca++ levels and functional parameters of mitochondria isolated after in vivo nephrotoxic injury with those of control mitochondria isolated at similar homogenate Ca++ levels, the components of mitochondrial Ca++ overload and functional deterioration solely attributable to in vivo events can be identified. These were detailed for gentamicin- and mercuric chloride-induced nephrotoxicity. Tissue and mitochondrial Ca++ overload are relatively late events during the development of renal tubule cell injury secondary to aminoglycosides or to mercuric chloride, occurring only when lethal cell injury is present by morphologic criteria. Since it correlates with lethal cell injury, the presence of tissue Ca++ overload can be of value in assessing this process, but care must be exercised in drawing conclusions about the extent of lethal cell injury, because the degree of Ca++ overload can be modified by factors, such as saline intake, independently of changes in the number of lethally injured cells.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of three different dosage schedules on kidney cortical accumulation of aminoglycosides was studied in rats. A daily dose of 10 mg/kg of gentamicin or tobramycin or 33.3 mg/kg of amikacin were given, either in single injections, three injections eight hours apart, or by continuous infusion. Kidney cortical levels of aminoglycosides were examined at regular intervals up to eight days. The pattern for cortical accumulation under different dose regimens was drug-dependent. Continuous infusion of gentamicin resulted in remarkably higher cortical concentrations than after intermittent administrations. In contrast, cortical levels of tobramycin were independent of the regimen used. For amikacin, higher accumulation resulted from continuous administration from the second day. However, the differences in tissue levels after one or the other dose regimen were less striking than for gentamicin. These observations were explained by differences in cortical uptake kinetics for aminoglycosides previously reported. Elevations in serum concentrations of gentamicin were associated with nonlinear uptake. Accordingly, uptake of gentamicin is more \"efficient\" at low serum concentrations. Uptake of tobramycin was linearly related to increases in serum levels. Amikacin showed a mixed kinetics pattern, saturation at low serum levels, and linear kinetics at high serum concentrations. This explains the higher cortical levels reached with continuous infusion of amikacin compared with intermittent administration. Uptake kinetics play an essential role in cortical aminoglycoside concentrations achieved after different dosing strategies. The design of regimens minimizing cortical uptake may decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity.\r"

The animals received a six-hour gentamicin infusion at a constant rate yielding steady-state serum concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 150 micrograms/mL. The renal cortical gentamicin concentrations were determined and related to the serum concentrations achieved. This relationship was nonlinear and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Gentamicin cortical uptake rate, however, did not show clear saturation in the range of gentamicin serum levels studied as was observed in rats with normal renal function. The Michaelis-Menten parameters determined by nonlinear regression were Km = 15.0, 73.9, and 135.7 micrograms/mL; and Vmax = 149.9, 213.7, and 239.2 micrograms/g cortex/h, respectively, for controls, rats with serum creatinine levels between 0.9 and 1.2 mg/dL, and those with levels between 1.3 and 1.8 mg/dL. It is concluded that at serum levels below 100 micrograms/mL, the gentamicin renal cortical uptake is diminished in rats with renal failure. This decrease in renal cortical uptake is more pronounced in the group of rats with more severe renal failure.\r"

We have established an animal model of cyclosporine-induced acute renal failure in the male Munich-Wistar rat by giving four daily doses of parenteral cyclosporine 60 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP). In this model, 20 minutes of bilateral renal ischemia preceding the first cyclosporine dose did not significantly increase the renal failure, but did increase mortality (65% v 17%), which was due in part to the CNS effect of cyclosporine. Pair-fed and pair-watered vehicle and saline controls were used. The renal morphologic changes induced by the castor oil vehicle of the commercial parenteral cyclosporine solution were quantitatively similar to those induced by cyclosporine, although the severity of the changes by light microscopy was considerably less in the vehicle-treated groups. However, by electron microscopy, pale lipid vacuoles were seen only in the cyclosporine-treated groups, whereas dense alterations in lysosomes and dilated endoplasmic reticulum were also seen in other groups. Renal blood flow determined by electromagnetic flow probe showed a significant decline during 2 hours after a single IP injection of cyclosporine (6.6 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.6 mL/min). A similar decline was seen following injection of the castor oil vehicle of the commercial cyclosporine parenteral preparation (6.6 +/- 0.5 to 5.1 +/- 0.5 mL/min), but not after an injection of a similar volume of mineral oil (6.7 +/- 0.3 to 6.3 +/- 0.2 mL/min). These studies suggest that brief renal ischemia does not increase cyclosporine nephrotoxicity significantly in this rat model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We summarize the results of a prospective uncontrolled trial of meclofenamate in severe steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome secondary to focal glomerular sclerosis and idiopathic membranous nephropathy. This study examined the effect of meclofenamate on proteinuria, serum albumin levels, serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, renal function, BP, liver function tests, and hematologic values. We also sought and evaluated adverse reactions due to this medication. We offer some suggestions for selective use and careful supervision of NSAIDs in the nephrotic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurological syndrome of considerable interest because homozygotes are highly predisposed to cancer. Vigorous casefinding in the United States in 1970-72 and 1980-84 identified 231 white, 29 black, and three Oriental A-T cases that provide information about the incidence and gene frequency of A-T. White patients identified in this study were born at the rate of 3.0 per million live births in the U.S. in the years 1965-69. The highest observed incidence was in the state of Michigan for 1965-69, where identified white A-T patients were born at the rate of 11.3 per million births. Based on the incidence data, the minimum frequency of a single hypothetical A-T gene in the U.S. white population was estimated to be .0017. Pedigree analysis, which estimates the gene frequency from the proportion of affected close blood relatives of homozygous probands, estimated the most likely gene frequency to be .007 on the assumption that A-T is a single homogeneous genetic syndrome, with 95% confidence limits of .0012-.02. Given that complementation analysis has demonstrated the genetic heterogeneity of A-T, the A-T heterozygote frequency will probably fall between 0.68% and 7.7%, with 2.8% being the most likely estimate.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic basis of cleft lip with or without cleft palate [CL(P)] remains unresolved. The controversy on the role of a major gene is confounded with possible population differences. This study examines the issue of population differences by comparing two contrasting populations: Caucasians and Japanese. Japanese are known to have higher population incidence of CL(P) and yet lower recurrence risks among relatives. The study subjects consist of 2,998 nuclear families of the Danish population and 627 families of the Japanese population. The uniformly coded data were subjected to complex segregation analysis based on the mixed model. The analysis has revealed that the Danish data can be best explained by a combination of major gene action and multifactorial inheritance. The best-fitting model is characterized by recessive gene with displacement effect (t) of 2.7 in the standardized unit and gene frequency of .035. The heritability is estimated as .97. The transmission probability of Aa----a for the major gene is consistent with 1/2. On the contrary, the Japanese data can be best accounted for only by multifactorial inheritance with the heritability estimate of .77. No major heterogeneity could be detected between subsets of the data within the populations as grouped by types of ascertainment or mating. It is thus concluded that the observed inconsistency between the two populations is explained by a significant role of major gene in the Caucasian population, but not in the Japanese population.\r"

Cocultivation of the patient's fibroblasts with either an immortal Chinese hamster cell line or with a human male fibroblast strain carrying a t(4;6)(p14;q21) translocation showed that the phenomenon was not corrected or induced by a diffusible factor or by cell-to-cell contact. In each experiment, only the patient's metaphase spreads revealed chromatid repulsion. In fusion hybrids between the patient's fibroblasts and an established Chinese hamster cell line, the human chromosomes behaved perfectly normally, suggesting that the gene product which is missing or mutant in Roberts/SC phocomelia syndrome is supplied by the Chinese hamster genome.\r"

The different alpha-thalassemia haplotypes are not evenly distributed throughout the country.

To circumvent problems inherent in such patient-control studies of complex diseases, we have now examined sharing of genes in the HLA and GM regions in 26 informative pairs of siblings who were both affected with IDDM. We found that: (1) in the total sample of affected sib-pairs, sharing of two HLA haplotypes was increased compared to Mendelian expectations, in agreement with many previous studies; (2) in the total sample, sharing of GM region genes (as measured by GM phenotype concordance) was not different from Mendelian expectations, given the distribution of parental mating types; and (3) affected sib-pairs who shared two HLA haplotypes showed significantly increased sharing of GM region genes compared to affected sib-pairs who shared one or zero HLA haplotypes (P = .018). These results provide new evidence for HLA-dependent effects of a locus at or near GM on susceptibility to IDDM.\r"

Several statistical techniques were used to evaluate the paternal-age-birth-defects associations for 86 groups of defects. Logistic regression analysis that controlled for maternal age and race indicated that older fathers had a somewhat higher risk for having babies with defects, when all types of defects were combined; an equivalent association for older mothers was not found. Logistic regression analyses also indicated modestly higher risks for older fathers for having babies with ventricular septal defects and atrial septal defects and substantially higher risks for having babies with defects classified in the category chondrodystrophy (largely sporadic achondroplasia) and babies with situs inversus. An association between elevated paternal age and situs inversus has not been reported before; the magnitude of the estimated increased risk for situs inversus was about the same as that found in this study for chondrodystrophy.\r"

Problems arise when attempts are made to use such data for other purposes. Specifically, spontaneous adverse drug reaction data, such as those published by the Food and Drug Administration, are inappropriate for calculating actual adverse drug reaction rates for specific drugs or for making safety comparisons among drugs. This is because these data are subject to numerous biases that can be easily identified and described but not easily corrected. As a result, data from spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting systems bear little relationship to the actual incidence of adverse drug reactions.\r"

A total of 137 laparoscopic biopsy specimens were taken of nonpigmented peritoneal lesions in 77 patients, among whom 70 were infertile. Seventy-three biopsy specimens showed endometrium-like glands and stroma, and another 12 showed only endometrioid stroma; no such histologic features of endometriosis were present in 10 biopsy specimens of normal uterosacral ligament peritoneum (p = 0.005, Fisher's test). Nonpigmented lesions that were commonly endometriotic were: white opacified peritoneum (endometriosis in 81% of n = 52 biopsy specimens), red flamelike lesions (81% of n = 16), and glandular lesions (resembling endometrium at hysteroscopy) (67% of n = 21). Lesions that were sometimes endometriotic were: subovarian adhesions (50% of n = 4), yellow-brown peritoneal patches (47% of n = 19), and circular peritoneal defects (45% of n = 11). However, thickened cribriform peritoneum usually was not endometriotic (9% of n = 11) and vesicular excrescences were, in every case, reactions to oil-based salpingographic medium (n = 5). Six patients underwent another laparoscopy within 6 to 24 months and each had developed pigmented endometriotic lesions in previously nonpigmented but abnormal areas. Visualization of pigment is not necessary to diagnose endometriosis, and definition of its early, nonpigmented appearance keeps the clinical category of \"unexplained infertility\" exclusive.\r"

During infusion of estradiol at 100 micrograms/24 hours, the frequency of events less than 180 seconds increased significantly in the myometrium but was unchanged in the mesometrium. Contracture activity (electromyographic events lasting more than 180 seconds) was significantly greater in the mesometrium than in the myometrium before estradiol administration. During estradiol infusion, contracture activity remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the mesometrial muscle may be a useful model to study the effects of various stimulators and inhibitors of uterine muscle function in the absence of stretch and local paracrine effects that occur in the uterus itself.\r"

Infrarenal obstruction of the inferior vena cava resulted in a moderate reduction in venous return and cardiac output with no change in arterial blood pressure, while suprarenal obstruction of the inferior vena cava caused a major decrease in cardiac output as well as in arterial pressure. Uterine blood flow varied in proportion with perfusion pressure at all levels of obstruction.

Amnion produced very little estrone from any substrate. Chorion utilized all substrates and decidua utilized estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate for estrone production. For both chorion and decidua, estrone sulfate was quantitatively the most important substrate. Chorionic tissues obtained after spontaneous labor produced greater levels of estrone than tissues obtained before labor (p less than 0.05). We could demonstrate no effect of cortisol, estriol, progesterone, prostaglandins, oxytocin, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate on estrogen production. We also measured endogenous concentrations of estrone and estradiol in fetal membranes. We found no significant difference in tissue concentrations between the two methods of delivery. There was no significant correlation between estrone and estradiol concentrations and distance from the placenta. We conclude that human chorion and decidua can produce estrogen, which may have some role in determining the timing of parturition.\r"

Cosignor analysis demonstrated persistence during gestation of the significant circadian rhythm of the nonpregnant state. As previously reported in control pregnancies, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased during gestation while the relative excursion of cortisol (expressed as the percent deviation from the 24-hour mean) was blunted. No significant difference was found between diabetic groups or when diabetic groups were compared with control subjects. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was common among diabetic women during pregnancy and post partum. Although these episodes were usually asymptomatic, the mean concomitant cortisol levels were increased over the corresponding cortisol levels of nonhypoglycemic diabetic and control subjects. We conclude that differences between control and type I and II diabetic subjects in carbohydrate tolerance or glycemic excursion are not explained by differences in cortisol levels or rhythm. The pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of cortisol is consistent with an autonomous source of adrenocorticotropin. Asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in insulin-requiring diabetic women and is associated with increased cortisol secretion.\r"

  ".U": "87073561\r", 
  ".W": "Antipyrine is commonly used to measure umbilical and uterine blood flow in the pregnant sheep. In the present experiment we investigated the effect of antipyrine on prostaglandin metabolism. Four pregnant ewes at 104 to 127 days' gestation were infused with either 1, 4, or 15 mg of antipyrine per minute via the fetal jugular vein. The 15 mg X min-1 dose was also infused into the maternal jugular vein in a fourth experiment. Prostaglandins in the uterine vein draining the pregnant horn were measured by radioimmunoassay and antipyrine by high-performance liquid chromatography. No change in the concentrations of either 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha or 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was observed with infusion of antipyrine at 1 mg X min-1. The 4 and 15 mg X min-1 infusion rates into the fetal jugular vein induced a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in maternal uterine vein 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha plasma concentrations. These concentrations decreased from 669.3 +/- 161.3 pg X ml-1 (mean +/- SD) before infusion to 306.5 +/- 104.0 pg X ml-1 after 3 hours of infusion at 4 mg X min-1 and from 744.2 +/- 256.8 to 105.0 +/- 24.2 pg X ml-1 at 15 mg X min-1. Significant changes in maternal uterine vein plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha/13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha ratio occurred only at the 15 mg X min-1 infusion of antipyrine into the fetal jugular vein (p less than 0.05). Maternal uterine vein 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha fell from 86.0 +/- 31.6 to 37.0 +/- 11.5 pg X ml-1 and the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha/13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha ratio rose from 0.14 +/- 0.10 to 0.35 +/- 0.10. We conclude that: antipyrine at doses currently used to measure uterine and umbilical blood flows inhibits 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha production and infusion rates of antipyrine less than 1 mg X min-1 probably do not affect maternal prostaglandin metabolism. We therefore recommend that if this method is to be used for measuring blood flow, antipyrine infusion rates should be less than 1 mg X min-1.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors ibuprofen and flurbiprofen can suppress postoperative adhesion formation, New Zealand White rabbits that had uterine tubal ligation underwent uterine tube reanastomosis and were given either saline solution (controls), 75 mg of ibuprofen intravenously every 6 hours, or 12.5 mg of flurbiprofen intravenously every 6 hours for 8 doses after operation. Both ibuprofen and flurbiprofen significantly reduced postoperative adhesions (p less than 0.025). With histologic indices of tissue reunion, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen were associated with significantly less scar thickness than controls (p less than 0.001) but did not have any significant effect on mucosal regeneration, foreign body reaction, and muscularis disruption. When all four histologic indices were compared, flurbiprofen but not ibuprofen had a significantly lower score than controls, indicating the greater potency of flurbiprofen over ibuprofen. Our findings show that ibuprofen and flurbiprofen can suppress perioperative and postoperative surgically induced inflammatory response associated with healing and thereby reduce adhesion formation and scar thickness.\r"

The intrauterine pressure cycles were analyzed for the maximum rate of rise, peak pressure, and active pressure area, together with the frequency of the cycles and the burst frequency, and related to the gap junction area. 17 beta-estradiol temporarily depressed uterine activity. The period of quiescence was followed by a pronounced increase in all variables of electrical and mechanical activity and also by a rise in gap junction area. The greatest increase in the maximum rate of rise of the intrauterine pressure cycles occurred 24 hours after estrogen and was associated with the maximum increase in gap junction area. These results indicate that a single dose of 17 beta-estradiol induces formation of myometrial gap junctions, which may facilitate the spread of electrical activity over the myometrium and improve coordination of uterine contractility.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the first study to correlate the ultrastructure of long-term monolayer cultures of human luteal cells with their secretion of relaxin and progesterone under basal and human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated conditions. In culture from 14 to 28 days, cells from both corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle and corpora lutea of pregnancy took on characteristics of granulosa luteal cells, particularly after exposure to human chorionic gonadotropin. Relaxin was detectable in the luteal cell cultures only at early time points. The effect of human chorionic gonadotropin on media relaxin levels differed in cells of the cycle and cells of pregnancy. In the cells of the cycle, relaxin was detectable only on day 2 and was decreased by human chorionic gonadotropin (p less than 0.01). In cells of pregnancy, relaxin was detectable for the first 4 days of culture and was not affected by human chorionic gonadotropin. Progesterone was detectable in all the luteal cell cultures and was enhanced by human chorionic gonadotropin (10 and 50 IU/ml) after 24 days of exposure. At earlier time points in both the luteal cells of the cycle and the luteal cells of pregnancy, the human chorionic gonadotropin-induced increases in progesterone levels were not as consistent. However, in all cases of progesterone enhancement, smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum was increased in the human chorionic gonadotropin-treated cells compared with corresponding controls, consistent with more active steroid production. In addition, gap junctions, considered to be responsive to trophic hormones, were increased in the treated cells. In conclusion, this long-term monolayer culture of human luteal cells, as monitored by ultrastructural and hormonal changes, retained the differentiated function of progesterone secretion and exhibited responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin. Therefore, morphologic and functional aspects of progesterone secretion may be investigated more closely with use of this long-term luteal cell culture system.\r"

Clomiphene citrate treatment (250 to 750 mg per cycle) decreased both endometrial estradiol and progesterone receptor concentrations. Estradiol receptor levels were nondetectable in seven tissue samples and progesterone receptor levels in four samples from the 12 subjects given clomiphene citrate compared to nondetectable estradiol receptor concentrations in one tissue sample and progesterone receptor concentrations in two samples from the 40 normal control subjects. In histologically dated endometrium, mean estradiol receptor concentrations on days 20 to 23 and progesterone receptor levels on days to 24 to 27 were lower than the values observed in the comparable dated endometrium of normal ovulatory women. Steroid receptor concentrations correlated negatively with the duration of clomiphene citrate therapy, which implies a time-dependent suppressive effect of clomiphene citrate on measurable cytosolic estradiol and progesterone receptor concentrations during the luteal phase of the cycle.\r"

When the study period was compared with the control period, there was an immediate significant decrease in the incidence of fetal breathing movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. Moreover the fetal breathing pattern was more irregular for the hour after the stimulus. There was also a significant but delayed increase in the incidence of gross fetal body movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. We hypothesize that an external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near-term healthy fetuses.\r"

The arterial pressure significantly increased during the constriction and postpartum phases (p less than 0.05). Blood volume remained relatively stable during the three pregnancy phases but significantly decreased in the postpartum phase (p less than 0.05).

Oocytes were placed in French straws containing Hepes-buffered Tyrode's medium and 2 mol/L of dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature (method 1) or at 0 degree C (method 2). They were cooled to -6 degrees C at a rate of -2 degrees C/min (method 1) or at -0.5 degree C/min (method 2). The freezing rate was -0.3 degree C/min to a temperature of -80 degrees C, and then it was plunged to -196 degrees C. After thawing 1 to 21 days later at 8 degrees C/min, 52% (method 1) and 64% (method 2) of the oocytes showed normal morphologic features, 87% (method 1) and 89% (method 2) were viable by trypan blue staining, and 56% (method 1) and 59% (method 2) were viable by fluorescein diacetate staining. Comparable values for freshly collected oocytes were 95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Frozen-thawed oocytes were fertilized in vitro at a level of 26% (17/66) compared with 76% (51/67) for freshly collected controls. When the penetration rate of human spermatozoa was examined, frozen-thawed oocytes were penetrated at about one third of the fresh controls (14% or 18/129 compared to 42% in method 1 and 22% or 21/95 compared to 58% in method 2). The ability of oocytes to tolerate storage at -196 degrees C could be important in regard to various genetic studies, supply for hamster egg penetration assay, and cryopreservation of human oocytes.\r"

Baseline estrone and estradiol levels (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in the group not receiving hormones (46.0 +/- 5.2 pg/ml and 28.4 +/- 3.1 pg/ml, respectively) than in the group in the Premarin phase of therapy (154 +/- 14 pg/ml and 79 +/- 13 pg/ml) and the group in the Premarin-Provera phase (135.1 +/- 8.3 pg/ml and 57.5 +/- 3.0 pg/ml) (p less than 0.005). Follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels were 118.7 +/- 5.3 mIU/ml, 118.7 +/- 9.5 mIU/ml, and 9.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, respectively, with no significant change after naloxone administration in untreated women. With hormone therapy the basal follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels decreased significantly while basal plasma estrone and estradiol increased significantly. In both the group in the Premarin phase of therapy and the group in the Premarin-Provera phase, luteinizing hormone levels increased significantly at 30 (135% +/- 10%, 144% +/- 8%), 45 (150% +/- 12%, 133% +/- 11%), 60 (149% +/- 15%, 128% +/- 11%), and 90 (139% +/- 15%, 132% +/- 13%) minutes after naloxone administration (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001). Follicle-stimulating hormone levels did not change significantly whereas prolactin levels showed a trend toward a decrease. These findings indicate that opioid inhibition of gonadotropins is reduced in postmenopausal women but increased with Premarin-Provera treatment. The effect of sex steroid on the opioid system in the postmenopausal women differs from that in the premenopausal women.\r"

Since dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is converted to estrogen, which is important in cervical softening, levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate together with those of estradiol, estriol, and progesterone were measured and compared in pregnant women undergoing induction of labor with ripe and unripe uterine cervices. While there were no differences between the levels of estradiol, estriol and progesterone in the two groups of women, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was significantly elevated in the group of women with ripe cervices. These findings suggest that cervical changes preceding the onset of labor are associated with a significant elevation of maternal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. Changes in maternal plasma estradiol, estriol, and progesterone levels do not appear to be clinically related to cervical ripeness.\r"

To analyze platelet aggregation five different parameters were evaluated in platelet-rich plasma and whole blood (by impedance aggregometry) with the use of four different aggregating agents: adenosine diphosphate, collagen, sodium arachidonate, and epinephrine. Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B2, and 1,6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were also analyzed. Platelet counts rose 19% after delivery. Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2 were not significantly changed during the two antepartum visits, but B-thromboglobulin levels were modestly elevated post partum. Levels of 1,6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha decreased significantly from a mean of 125 pg/ml before delivery to 50 pg/ml post partum. All antepartum parameters on whole blood aggregation that were significantly different from postpartum values showed enhanced antepartum reactivity. In platelet-rich plasma, pregnancy was associated with greater platelet reactivity except for two variables, time to half-maximal aggregation for epinephrine and the extent of aggregation by collagen, both noted during the first antepartum evaluation. When the patient cohort of 19 was subdivided according to smoking status, all aggregation parameters of significance (p less than 0.05) demonstrated increased platelet reactivity during pregnancy compared with postpartum values. Smoking women accounted for a disproportionate number of significantly enhanced reactivity (seven variables versus three).\r"

  ".W": "In responsive tissues the induction of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase activity is a marker of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol action. In this study we investigated the responsiveness of various malignant cells, which were derived from carcinomas of gynecologic origin, to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol; we did so because it has been demonstrated that replication of certain malignant human cells that are 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-responsive is inhibited by treatment with this substance. We found that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol treatment caused an increase in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase activity in gynecologic carcinoma cells that were maintained in monolayer culture. The cells were established from ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vaginal neoplasms. After treatment with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (10 nmol/L) for 18 hours, the specific activity of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase increased between 2,4- and 49-fold in these cells. This increase in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase activity is suggestive that certain gynecologic malignancies are responsive to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. We also found, however, that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol did not act to decrease the rate of replication of these cells; indeed in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol caused a decrease in doubling time; in the other cells of this study, there was no effect of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol on cell replication.\r"

We continuously monitored distal aortic blood flow by flowmeter, fetal heart rate, and amniotic fluid pressure in seven pregnant baboons near term. Four of the animals received a constant intravenous infusion of [7-3H]dehydroepiandrosterone and [4-14C]estradiol for 270 minutes. A 50% reduction in mean distal aortic blood flow was imposed after 60 minutes by means of partial occlusion of the aorta with a snare device and released at 180 minutes. Blood was collected at 10-minute intervals from 30 to 60 minutes, 120 to 180 minutes, and 240 to 270 minutes. Concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, and cortisol in maternal plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay. Metabolic clearance rates of dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol were calculated from plasma concentrations of [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone and [14C]estradiol. There was no significant change in maternal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or cortisol with alterations in distal aortic blood flow. Three animals exhibited no fetal heart rate evidence of fetal stress; estradiol levels declined during occlusion and returned toward control after release of the snare. Four animals exhibited repetitive late decelerations under conditions of reduced flow; estradiol was unchanged or rose slightly during occlusion but increased three- to 10-fold after release whereas the metabolic clearance rate of both dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol remained stable. We conclude that placental hypoperfusion without fetal stress results in decreased conversion of aromatizable substrate and elevated maternal estradiol levels during acute hypoxemic fetal stress probably represent increased production of fetal androgen.\r"

  ".W": "It has previously been reported that there is an increase in the concentration of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors as well as an increase in the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase stimulation by L-isoproterenol in fetal rabbit myocardial membranes from 21 to 31 days' gestation. To investigate whether a change in the catalytic component of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex is responsible for the observed increase in adenylate cyclase activity, I have measured the latter in the presence of forskolin and manganese chloride, compounds that can directly stimulate the catalytic component. Myocardial membranes were obtained from fetal rabbits at 21, 28, and 31 days' gestation and from pregnant adult animals. There was an increase in basal adenylate cyclase activity from the fetal to the adult stage. The percent of maximal stimulation by L-isoproterenol in fetuses from 21 through 28 to 31 days' gestation and in the adult animal. However, although forskolin was the most potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, the degree of stimulation was equivalent in all groups tested. Similar results were obtained with manganese chloride. We conclude that the catalytic component of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex in myocardial membranes is stimulated to an equivalent degree at all gestational ages in fetal and adult rabbits and shows no maturational changes.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of sustained hypoxemia with progressive acidemia on pituitary-adrenal endocrine function (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol) and on adrenal blood flow in fetal sheep. Hypoxemia was induced by the maternal sheep breathing a gas mixture containing 9% oxygen, with 3% carbon dioxide added. Induced hypoxemia resulted in a progressive fetal metabolic acidosis but with little change in maternal pH. During induced hypoxemia there was little change in maternal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone or cortisol level. Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol increased to peak values within 2.8 hours of induced hypoxia but by 7.2 hours had begun to fall to values that were not significantly different from those at 1.4 hours. Fetal adrenal blood flow (microsphere technique) also increased significantly and remained elevated throughout the duration (7.2 hours) of hypoxemia. The maximum fetal adrenal blood flow achieved during hypoxemia was significantly correlated with the basal (prehypoxemia) flow to the adrenals. We conclude that the changes in fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and adrenal blood flow seen in short-term hypoxemia are reproduced during sustained hypoxemia with acidemia. Furthermore, the noted rise in the fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone level may be an important factor contributing to the increase in adrenal blood flow during hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "Acute increases in maternal plasma osmolality can increase amniotic fluid osmolality. Amniotic fluid is primarily derived from fetal urine production, and arginine vasopressin infusion can affect both fetal urine production and amniotic fluid osmolality. To assess the effect of short-term changes in maternal osmolality on fetal arginine vasopressin secretion and renal function, six ewes of 126 +/- 1 days' gestation received intravenous infusions of 20% mannitol (500 ml/10 min). In response to mannitol infusion, both maternal and fetal plasma osmolality increased significantly (302 +/- 3 to 326 +/- 2 and 300 +/- 1 to 309 +/- 2 mosm, respectively). Increased fetal plasma and urine arginine vasopressin concentrations were associated with significant increases in fetal urine osmolality (146 +/- 12 to 262 +/- 30 mosm) and sodium concentration (35.8 +/- 2.8 to 76.5 +/- 20 mu Eq/ml), but fetal urine production rates did not change (0.68 +/- 0.11 to 0.62 +/- 0.15 ml/min). These conclusions were reached: Acute increases in maternal osmolality can affect fetal arginine vasopressin secretion; arginine vasopressin-induced increases in fetal urine osmolality may contribute to increased amniotic fluid osmolality in response to maternal hyperosmolality.\r"

Six healthy women volunteered to ingest a standard 1000 mg dose at 36 weeks' gestation and 6 weeks post partum. Mean maternal serum concentrations of acetaminophen were consistently less than but not significantly different from the postpartum values. The mean half-life of acetaminophen during pregnancy (3.7 hours) was not significantly different from the nonpregnant value (3.1 hours). The maximum plasma concentration occurred at 0.8 hours and was 20.8 +/- 6.9 micrograms/ml during pregnancy and 23.7 +/- 6.0 micrograms/ml in the nonpregnant state. The absorption, metabolism, and renal clearance of acetaminophen were unchanged. The decrease in the mean area under the curve during pregnancy may be explained by the increase in volume of distribution of acetaminophen. Potentially hepatotoxic metabolites were not measurable in the maternal serum. We conclude that the absorption and disposition of acetaminophen, when used in a standard oral dose, are not affected by pregnancy.\r"

Despite removal of large biopsy specimens, the retina has remained attached for 20 months postoperatively in one case and for three months in the other. In a third patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the clinical course and postmortem immunopathology were suggestive of a herpes simplex virus infection, initially affecting the retina and subsequently the optic nerves, chiasm, tracts, and central nervous system. These cases illustrate that the virus associated with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome is easily demonstrable using vitrectomy and endoretinal biopsy in the acute phase of the disease, but may be difficult to demonstrate in chronically detached atrophic retinas.\r"

Only patients with at least six months follow-up were considered for success. Twenty-five eyes (43%) were anatomically reattached. Factors associated with good anatomic outcome included greater mean preoperative pupillary dilation, absence of posterior synechiae, deep anterior chamber, partial detachment or open-funnel total detachment configuration, and adequate posterior membrane removal. Of the 25 eyes with attached retinas, 11 had fixing and following visual acuities or better. Three eyes with attached retinas had no light perception and 11 eyes with attached retinas had light perception only. To maximize anatomic and functional results we emphasize the need to operate early, when the retinal funnel is still open.\r"

The view to the fundus was superior to that obtained in our previous model of cyanoacrylate retinopexy in the air-filled eye. Glue delivery was consequently both easier and more precise through silicone oil relative to air. The chorioretinal adhesions produced with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive were compared with those produced by transscleral retinal cryopexy and were found to be more rapid in onset as well as stronger. An exaggerated tissue response adjacent to the cyanoacrylate site suggested a potential toxic chemical or thermal reaction, or both, to the tissue adhesive, but there was no evidence of any distant ocular effects.\r"

The patients had bilateral and total cataract in the first weeks of life, underwent cataract surgery, and developed nystagmus and strabismus. Corrected visual acuity was lower than 20/40 in aphakic eyes. Patients were mentally normal, and at school age they visited a school for blind and visually impaired children. The majority of the patients developed axial myopia with myopic fundus changes; aphakic refraction usually was lower than 10.0 diopters after the first decade. The cardiac myopathy was progressive and the cause of premature death. Three of the 12 patients died in the neonatal period and six patients died in early adulthood.\r"

  ".W": "The cytogenesis of giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) was assessed by immunohistochemical methods. Three GCT were analyzed by a sensitive immunoalkaline phosphatase technique with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including eight reacting with separate antigens previously found to be present on mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and one specific for the endothelial marker, coagulation Factor 8. Among the MP-associated antigens evaluated were leukocyte common antigen (LCA), HLA-DR, C3b receptor, and C3bi receptor. Also incorporated in the panel were antibodies to MP-associated antigens with well-characterized tissue distribution but of currently unknown function. Constituent cells of the tumors varied in their reactions with the antibodies of the panel. Although mononuclear cells in tumor stroma were labeled with all of the antibodies against the MP markers, giant cells reacted strongly only with antibodies to LCA and the MP-associated antigen recognized by the antibody EBM11. Giant cells were weakly and focally labeled with antibodies (KB90 and UCHM1) against two additional MP-associated determinants and were unreactive with the remaining antibodies in the panel. Spindled stromal cells, which appeared to produce collagen, were not labeled with any of the antibodies in the panel. Only endothelial cells reacted with antibody to Factor 8. The results of this study suggest that giant cells of GCT are derived from stromal cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and that the stromal precurser cells lose some, but not all, MP-associated antigens as they mature into giant cells.\r"

Microdensitometrically, all strains exhibited essentially the same patterns of age changes, that is, bone mass corrected by the diameter of the shaft reached the peak value when the mice were 4 or 5 months of age and then fell linearly with age up to over 20 months of age. Two strains, SAM-R/3 and SAM-P/6, which originated from the same ancestry on pedigree, had a significantly lower peak bone mass than other strains (SAM-R/1, SAM-R/2, SAM-P/1, and SAM-P/2). On the other hand, the strains with a low peak bone mass had the same rate of decrease as other strains. Mineral and collagen contents per dry weight of bone showed little difference among the strains. Histologic studies of tibia, femur, and lumbar spine revealed that the osteopenia was not due to osteomalacia but, rather, to osteoporosis. The elderly mice in these two strains were prone to fracture, thus should be important models for study of senile osteoporosis seen clinically.\r"

  ".W": "In diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, circulating monocytes adhere to the endothelium of the vessel wall and emigrate into the intima. Atherosclerotic lesions may develop, characterized by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages and proliferating smooth muscle cells recruited from the media. Using rat peritoneal macrophages, the authors examined the influence of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on several variables of macrophage function that may contribute to lesion formation, including adhesion to bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the production of chemoattractants and mitogens for VSMCs, and the release of the reactive oxygen species, superoxide. In general, a hypercholesterolemia-induced augmentation of macrophage function was observed. In comparison with macrophages from normal animals (N M phi s), macrophages from hypercholesterolemic animals (H M phi s) were 50-80% more adhesive to BAECs and VSMCs. H M phi-secreted products increased VSMC migration 6 to 7-fold, whereas N M0s only stimulated motility 2.5-fold. In addition, H M phi-conditioned media produced increased VSMC growth 5-fold, compared with a 2.5-fold increase produced by N M phi-conditioned media. Although the production of superoxide was found to be the same for both N M phi s and H M phi s, the release of superoxide by macrophages found in the intima of hypercholesterolemic animals may contribute to the necrosis of cells in the developing lesion. These results suggest that dietary cholesterol may accelerate atherosclerotic lesion formation by inducing specific changes in the properties of circulating monocytes and intimal macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the parathyroid glands from 100 previously healthy subjects who died suddenly and were admitted to the Dade County Medical Examiner's (ME) morgue and from 66 inpatients who died at Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH). Parathyroid glands in patients with diseases (JMH series) were heavier than those in healthy persons (ME series), and both groups of glands were significantly heavier than those previously reported. Mean glandular weight in white subjects was 42.6 +/- 20.3 mg, with a range of 22-103 mg. The 95% upper limit of gland weight for healthy white subjects was 73.1 mg and for black subjects, 91.6 mg. The size and weight exhibited a skewed distribution. Gland weight varied with age, increasing to a maximum in the 41-60 year old age group in all subsets except white women, in whom it continued to increase till after age 70. There was slight correlation (r2 = 0.15) of gland weight with body weight within series and race groups; parenchymal content of the glands was not constant but correlated positively with glandular weight. Glands from both series had a comparable fat content. Fat was unevenly distributed throughout the gland, and its amount was highly variable, ranging between 0 and 90%, with a mean of 26% for white subjects and 24% for black subjects in both series. Therefore, percentage fat may not be used as an index of hyperplasia. Healthy back subjects had heavier glands than healthy white subjects, unaccounted for by differences in body weights; this difference was not statistically significant in subjects with disease. Within the black race, glands were not significantly heavier in disease than in health, and in the few cases with serum calcium determinations, the gland weight did not vary inversely with serum calcium levels as in white subjects, suggesting a basic difference in parathyroid calcium metabolism between the two races.\r"

Histologic appearance, DNA synthetic activity, labeling count, and mitotic index were serially evaluated in both ligated and nonligated parts of the liver after interruption of the portal flow to one fourth, one third, and two thirds of the liver mass. The authors confirmed the presence of compensatory hyperplasia induced in the nonligated liver lobe(s) by PBL, and its intensity was roughly proportional to the amount of liver tissue devoid of portal perfusion. Portal-deprived liver tissue underwent a rapid and progressive atrophy, and, by the end of the first week, the weight of this part had decreased 10-fold. By a balance between atrophy and compensatory growth, the total liver weight was maintained at the level of sham-operated animals throughout the experiment. PBL invariably resulted in early centrilobular necrosis, which occupied 15-24% of the ligated lobe(s). However, already after 4 days it was almost totally resorbed and did not appear de novo. PBL was not followed by local collateralization.\r"

Parenchymal and meningeal inflammatory infiltrates were composed of T cells, with fewer natural killer and B cells, and variable numbers of granulocytes and macrophages. T4+ and T8+ cells were present in equal numbers. Inflammatory cells expressed interleukin-2 receptor, MHC Class I (HLA-alpha chain, beta-2 microglobulin), and MHC Class II (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ) molecules. There was increased MHC molecule expression in HSE on resident cells, including neurons and vascular endothelium, and vascular expression of HLA-DR was greater than that of HLA-DQ (P less than 0.01). No correlations between immune parameters with amount of corticosteroid therapy or duration of illness before biopsy was performed or outcome were found. T cell-mediated cytotoxic and delayed hypersensitivity mechanisms may contribute to tissue injury in HSE.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied xanthomatous skin in cholesterol-fed rabbits for changes in lipid content and in activities of enzymes regulating intracellular lipid content. After 80 days of hypercholesterolemic diet, xanthomas were widespread and changes in lipid metabolism were marked. In both tissue homogenates and cell membrane pellets, unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids increased 2-fold to 6-fold, and cholesteryl esters increased about 30-fold. Tissue triglycerides, however, decreased to half the levels found in control skin. Cholesterol esterification rates, measured by activity of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase, increased moderately to markedly; hydrolase activity against 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate also increased at both acid and neutral pH, but hydrolase activity against cholesterol oleate increased only at acid pH. Thus, hypercholesterolemia caused striking increases in intracellular cholesterol esterification rates, increases in lipase activity at both neutral and acid pH, and increases in cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity at acid pH. Increases in cholesterol-esterifying activity uniformly exceeded increases in cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in congruence with net accumulation of cholesteryl ester. Skin xanthoma grade, however, had no consistent relation to the cholesterol esterification rates. Instead, the enzyme data suggested that marked abnormalities of lipid metabolism are diffusely distributed through dermal tissue as a precondition for the focal emergence of xanthomas.\r"

The authors observed frequent occurrence of \"coated\" microdomains in the form of budding vesicles in the proliferated components of this network and suspected a potential role the proliferated membranes might have in the endocytosis of molecules into myotubes undergoing repair or regeneration. Five-day-old myotubes in culture were incubated at 37 C and between 2 and 4 C with two tracers, Lucifer yellow and ferritin, both known to enter other types of cells via a fluid-phase endocytotic pathway. The differential penetration of Lucifer yellow at 37 C and below 2-4 C was examined by fluorescence microscopy and by electron microscopy. Lucifer yellow was rendered electron-opaque by photoreacting it with an intense light in the presence of DAB. Ferritin penetration at 37 C and between 2 and 4 C was compared and quantitated ultrastructurally. The authors found that endocytosis of the tracers into myotubes and eventually into lysosomes took place after the tracers had diffused into the lumen of the proliferated SCIM network. These processes were inhibited below 4 C. This finding, coupled with the presence of \"coated\" microdomains in the proliferated membranes, led us to suspect that the SCIM network may have a role in membrane turnover of metabolically active diseased muscle cells undergoing regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "The adherence of circulating neutrophils to vascular endothelium represents a necessary step in the chemotactic emigration of neutrophils to extravascular inflammatory sites. Studies of neutrophil adherence induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were undertaken to determine the ability of a nonchemotactic neutrophil stimulus to provoke increased adherence. The authors found that the adherence of human neutrophils to plastic surfaces or confluent monolayers of endothelial cells is enhanced in a concentration-dependent fashion by exposure of neutrophils to PMA. The effect of PMA concentration (0.1-5.0 ng/ml) on increased neutrophil adherence parallels that observed for superoxide anion generation and release of lysosomal enzymes from specific granules. Whereas complement C5a-treated neutrophils exhibited a fourfold to fivefold increase in adherence to endothelial cells, PMA-treated neutrophils showed a 10-fold to 20-fold increase. The ability of PMA to cause increased neutrophil adherence to endothelium appeared to be directed primarily at the neutrophil. Pretreatment of neutrophils with PMA was as effective as coincubation in causing increased adherence to plastic surfaces or confluent cultured endothelial cells, but pretreatment of endothelial cells with PMA failed to promote neutrophil adherence. Alteration of neutrophil cytoskeletal structures by cytochalasin B treatment did not prevent subsequent PMA-stimulated neutrophil adherence. These results demonstrate that increased neutrophil adherence to surfaces can be induced by a nonchemotactic stimulus and that neutrophil adherence is independent of organized microfilaments.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have investigated early changes in liver cell gap and tight junctions that occur when rats are fed a carcinogenic diet. Animals were fed a choline-deficient diet that contained 0.1% ethionine (CDE) for periods up to 6 weeks. Short-term feeding of this diet results in the rapid proliferation of so-called \"oval cells\" within the liver, which is reversible upon returning the rats to a normal diet. Livers from animals fed the diet were removed at various times during feeding and during recovery from the diet and were analyzed by light and electron microscopy. The freeze-fracture technique was used to produce extended views of the internal structure of liver cell membranes at each stage under study. The characteristic junctional complex surrounding canalicular regions in normal liver disappears after only 2 weeks of the CDE regimen. Gap junctions were not found after 4 weeks of the diet, and tight junctions became increasingly disorganized. Tight junction elements were observed, however, between hepatocytes and oval cells, which indicated that these two cell types do interact directly. Changes occur in the structural complexity of tight junction elements between hepatocytes and between hepatocytes and oval cells. Recovery from the CDE diet results in a rapid increase in junctional complexity, and the large gap junction plaques characteristic of normal liver are visible within 2 weeks after cessation of the CDE regimen. These and other observations demonstrate that reversible alterations in hepatocyte gap and tight junctions occur as a result of administration of a diet that induces oval cell proliferation. The relationship of these changes to those that have been reported during other processes of cell proliferation are discussed.\r"

GBM CSs (known to consist mainly of heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycans) were stained in vivo and, in a separate group of animals by an in vitro method, with the cationic marker polyethyleneimine (PEI) studied by electron microscopic examination. Four hours after administration of PAN, there was a significant decrease in GBM lamina rara externa CSs: 18 +/- 0.7 versus 22.0 +/- 2.2 per 1000 nm GBM in controls by PEI injection and 17.2 +/- 2.7 versus 21.1 +/- 1.6 per 1000 nm GBM in controls by PEI in vitro staining. This CS alteration coincided with changes in glomerular epithelial cell morphologic characteristics (increased cytoplasmic organelles and rough endoplasmic reticulum) and preceded the detection of foot process broadening (at 24 hours) and increased urinary albuminuria (suggested at 12-24 hours, statistically significant at 36-48 hours). These results suggest that GBM CS-heparan sulfate proteoglycan alterations consisting of either decreased number and/or less anionic charge occur early in PAN and support a role for glomerular epithelial cell maintenance of GBM CS for normal glomerular function.\r"

Round and ovoid cells which are lymphocyte- and monocyte-like hematogenous cells account for less than 5% of the cell population. The bulk of the intimal population (over 95%) is made up of cells that can be described as elongated, stellate, elongated with side processes, and irregularly shaped. To identify these morphologic forms, the authors have used target electron microscopy. It has been established that elongated cells devoid of side processes possess all the ultrastructural features of differentiated smooth muscle cells: a developed contractile apparatus in the form of microfilament bundles with dense bodies occupying most of the cytoplasm, basal membrane surrounding the whole of the cell, and micropinocytotic vesicles along the plasma membrane. The other morphologic forms have an ultra-structure that allows us to identify them as so-called modified smooth muscle cells. They differ from the typical smooth muscle cells in that they have fewer contractile structures and a more developed biosynthetic apparatus. Some of stellate and irregular shaped cells are utterly devoid of contractile structures. To quantitate the number of cells of different morphologic forms, the authors used alcoholic-alkaline dissociation of prefixed intima. It was established that the intimal population is multiplied at the site of an atherosclerotic lesion, the number of stellate cells being increased much more substantially, compared with other morphologic cell forms. It was found that an increase in the number of stellate cells is related to such sequelae of atherosclerosis in aorta as intimal thickening, deposition of lipids, and an increased amount of collagen. There was a high positive correlation between the alteration in the stellate cell number occurring in the intima and the above-mentioned parameters (correlation coefficients were 0.732, 0.800 and 0.953, respectively). The correlations between these indexes and the total number of intimal cells or the number of cells belonging to each of the other morphologic forms were not so high. A multivariate analysis gave similar results. Thus, it may be suggested that stellate cells are the principal cell type involved in the disease. This report discusses the origin of stellate and other intimal cells and their role in atherogenesis.\r"

The modified foot allowed 12-15 degrees of dorsiflexion and reduced stiffness in the area of the metatarsal-phalangeal (MTP) joint. The amputees were allowed to vary the stiffness at the two joints to obtain what \"felt best.\" The amputees agreed that in comparison to the standard single-axis foot, the modified foot: a) offered a more comfortable gait while walking on level ground; b) made walking up inclines easier; c) affected knee stability while walking on declines; and d) made foot placement on stairs and ladders more critical due to potential knee instability. As well as qualitative reactions, changes in the gait cycle were measured quantitatively for different speeds and inclinations of walking on a treadmill. Measurements from normal subjects matched by age and sex were used for control purposes. All participants wore soft-soled shoes. The amputees selected a stiffness that allowed a degree of dorsiflexion which precisely matched on average that of the normal subjects. In contrast, they selected a stiffness at the MTP joint which allowed very little flexion of the toes. Significant changes also occurred in the pattern of hip movements, so that they became much more symmetrical on the two sides, although substantial differences remained between the hip movements of the amputees and the normal subjects. If modifications in the ankle joint can be coupled with improvements in the knee joint to prevent potential instability, a much improved gait should be possible for above-knee amputees.\r"

Patients at the severe end of this spectrum are best described as having an \"obsessive-compulsive psychosis.\" The authors discuss the implications of these considerations for DSM-III revisions.\r"

For the hangover condition, they flew 14 hours after drinking enough ethanol mixed with diet soft drinks to attain a blood alcohol concentration of 100 mg/dl. Pilot performance was worse in the hangover condition on virtually all measures but significantly worse on three of six variance measures and one of six performance measures. The results indicate that caution should be exercised when piloting an aircraft 14 hours or less after ingesting similar quantities of alcohol.\r"

Furthermore, panic attacks may have been the reason that many subjects with other disorders sought treatment.\r"

The residency differs from most U.S. residencies in having trainees responsible for patients wherever they are being treated (residents are not rotated between services), its strong team orientation, and the value placed on community work.\r"

  ".W": "Based on data from the five sites of the National Institute of Mental Health-sponsored Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Program, this paper examines the prevalence of psychiatric disorder among recent medical service users versus nonusers, with a particular focus on affective disorders, substance abuse/dependence, and phobias. The rate of current Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) disorders among medical users in all five ECA sites is 21.7 per cent (slightly higher than general population rates) versus 16.7 per cent among nonusers; there is generally no difference between users and nonusers with past DIS diagnoses. Affective disorders were among the most common mental disorders of medical service users, especially among females, with little variation between sites: females: users: 6.9 per cent to 9.3 per cent, nonusers: 3.4 per cent to 6.4 per cent, and males: users: 3.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent, nonusers: 1.2 per cent to 4.1 per cent. Rates of phobias among persons using medical services are also higher than among nonusers. Substance abuse disorders are at least as common among persons who use medical services (8 per cent to 14 per cent of male users) as among those who do not (9 per cent to 11 per cent of male nonusers). The high rates of affective disorders among women and of substance abuse among male medical service users underscore the need to increase the ability of general medical practitioners to recognize and manage or refer these conditions.\r"

Latino young women fall in between the extremely low rate of the Whites and the extremely high rate of the Blacks. Mexican and Puerto Rican young women have similar proportions of premarital first births, but the marital first birth rate for young Mexicans is twice that of the Puerto Ricans. The bulk of Mexican first births, like births to Whites, occur within marriage, while Puerto Rican first births are similar to those of Blacks, the majority being out-of-wedlock. These racial/ethnic differences in premarital first birth rates do not change greatly when socioeconomic status, and birthplace of respondents and respondents' parents are controlled.\r"

  ".U": "87073886\r", 
  ".W": "A survey was conducted to ascertain the risk of tuberculosis (TB) among migrant farm workers on the Delmarva peninsula. Relevant histories were obtained from 842 migrants; a total of 709 skin tests were completed, and 239 sputum specimens were examined for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture. No cases of infectious tuberculosis were ascertained by history or AFB examination. One sputum culture was positive for M. tuberculosis and 13 were positive for various species of nontuberculous mycobacteria. Thirty-seven per cent of migrants tested had significant skin test reactions of 10 mm or more. Reaction rates for men were 41 per cent and for women 25 per cent. Age specific rates ranged from 14 per cent in children aged 5-14 to 54 per cent for ages 45-54. Rates for the principal national/ethnic groups were Haitians 55 per cent, Mexicans 36 per cent, US Blacks 29 per cent and US-born Latinos 20 per cent. Based on these results and other information currently available, it is recommended that current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations for TB prophylaxis continue to be applied for migrant workers, but that mass screening by skin testing in camp populations not be emphasized. Other recommendations focus on: case finding of active disease, improving continuity and follow-up, increasing coordination among involved agencies, and actively supporting improved economic and living conditions for migrant farm workers.\r"

  ".W": "We compared ambulatory and inpatient surgery utilization by age level for procedures known to be frequently performed on an ambulatory basis. Our scope of data was the Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital in Syracuse, New York during 1984. The hospital operates one of the largest freestanding ambulatory surgery programs in the United States. The study included 8,348 ambulatory procedures, 42 per cent of all operations performed under the aegis of this institution. At the aggregate, the inpatient surgery included a somewhat lower proportion of young adults and a higher proportion of individuals aged 65 and over did outpatient surgery. For specific procedures, however, age distributions differed. Ambulatory procedures included lower percentages of elderly than did inpatient utilization for inguinal hernia repair, carpal tunnel release, destruction of larynx lesions, hernia repairs, destruction of skin lesions, and other operations, while ambulatory utilization for lens procedures included higher percentages of elderly patients than did inpatient utilization. Physician practice patterns also appeared to influence the setting of certain procedures. The study data suggested that persons involved in health planning should evaluate ambulatory surgery use on an age and procedure-specific basis, and utilization review should evaluate procedures on a case-by-case basis.\r"

  ".W": "Three nations carried out large surveys of their non-institutionalized populations during the period 1976-81, with essentially similar techniques for measuring height and weight. Using criteria previously published for the British survey, we analyzed the Canadian and United States data and compared the prevalence of excessive weight for ages 20-64 in the three countries. Overweight was defined as a Quetelet index value of 25.1-30, and obesity as a value exceeding 30. Compared to their Canadian and British counterparts, American men are more likely to be overweight or obese, especially at the lower age levels. The proportion of excessively heavy men reaches a plateau around age 50 in all three countries, possibly indicative of a survivor phenomenon. Among women, the US has the highest proportion of excessively heavy individuals at all ages except 20-24; this difference is especially marked at ages 45-54. Unlike men, there is no evidence that the proportion of overweight or obese women reaches a plateau by age 64.\r"

During this period of time, more than 74 per cent of human exposures to rabid animals involved raccoons. Reports of animal bites of humans, however, showed only a 2.6 per cent increase. The raccoon rabies epizootic has had significant public health impact in terms of human rabies postexposure prophylaxis and rabies control programs.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a public health and education screening program aimed at all 4,797 four to five year old children registering for kindergarten in three school districts of southern Ontario, Canada. Children received either the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) with a community health intervention program for positive screeness; the DDST with no intervention for positive screenees; or no screening test. The intervention program consisted of referral to the child's physician for assessment; a review conference between the child's teacher and the school health nurse; parent counseling; and monitoring of the child in school by the school health nurse. At the end of the third school year, no differences were found between positive screenees in the community health intervention group and the \"no intervention\" groups using individual academic achievement, cognitive, and developmental tests. Parents' reports revealed no differences between groups in children's mental, social, and behavioral well-being. However, parents of intervention program children had more worry about their child's school progress suggesting a potentially harmful labeling effect. In comparison to a random sample of children with normal DDST results, or a random sample of children who had randomly not been screened, the children with positive preschool DDSTs had substantially more school problems three years after screening.\r"

  ".W": "Local and federal government agencies are often asked to investigate apparent clusters of cancer in communities or workplaces. Often these investigations cannot utilize the methods that have been developed for evaluation of disease clusters because the clusters are too small, and the populations to be studied and the periods of time to be covered are determined in an a posteriori manner. Still, government investigators are called upon to render an official opinion of the apparent clusters. Application of a theoretical approach to cluster analysis must give way to a more pragmatic approach. A review of 61 investigations of apparent clusters conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) during the period 1978-84 showed that most of the clusters contained five or fewer cases and had no plausible occupational etiology. Despite the few clusters that were identified, these investigations generally provided a service to workers and employers who were concerned about occupational cancer.\r"
