Eight of 40 patients (20%) evaluable after the first course of BCNU showed partial or minor response. Only 18 patients were evaluable after the first course of cisplatin, and 5 were evaluable after the second course of BCNU. Median survival was 9 months (range, 2 weeks to 6 years). Cerebral or ocular toxicity unique to this method of chemotherapy administration and failure to show clinical improvement were the most common reasons for removal from study. Because of the high attrition rate, the authors were unable to determine a meaningful response to alternating sequential BCNU and cisplatin or to test the clinical degree of cross-resistance to these agents in human malignant glioma.\r"

To study the natural history and malignant potential of this tumor, the English literature was reviewed to obtain an additional 56 cases. Clinical characteristics include pain and a mass in most patients, although many are found incidentally. Jaundice, hemoperitoneum, nausea, and vomiting are unusual findings. Most patients are treated by wide resection with good results. These tumors appear to be indolent. However, 16% of patients had major organ or blood vessel invasion, and 7% had liver metastases at some time during the course of their disease, illustrating the malignant nature of this tumor. Long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of treatment, especially in the case of locally advanced and metastatic disease.\r"

The authors examined 22 cases of these tumors histologically and histochemically. In 12 malignant cases, the tumors inside the ducts consisted of cancerous lesions over small areas along with papillary or atypical hyperplasia. Tumors in ten benign cases mainly consisted of papillary hyperplasia. Except for three patients with carcinoma in situ, cancerous tumors infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma and, in some cases, were observed invading the bile duct or duodenum. A mucous histochemical study showed evidence of sialomucin in malignant cases; neutral mucin was dominant in benign cases. Characteristics of this disease were also compared with 13 cases of mucinous cystic neoplasm. From the results, it was concluded that these two diseases can be classified into the same conceptual category.\r"

Tumor-associated antigen expression was significantly higher in malignant ovarian neoplasms than in benign neoplasms (P less than 0.001 for all three antigens). SM3 was expressed more specifically in malignant than benign tumors but had a lower affinity than HMFG1 and HMFG2. Multi-parameter flow cytometric evaluation of a panel of monoclonal antibodies can be used to help in choosing the best antibody for immunohistochemistry, imaging, and eventually treatment of ovarian tumors.\r"

To gain insight into the clinical and cytogenetic implications of MDS patients in whom myelofibrosis develops, statistical analysis was done on 82 primary MDS patients with successful cytogenetic results. Seven patients had myelofibrosis during the course of the disease (8.5%, Group I), 34 had abnormal karyotypes without myelofibrosis (41.5%, Group II), and the other 41 had abnormal karyotypes without myelofibrosis (50%, Group III). All of the MDS patients except one with myelofibrosis had cytogenetic abnormalities, and four of them had multiple chromosome abnormalities. In univariant analysis, MDS patients with myelofibrosis showed no significant differences in age, sex, or peripheral blood data. In contrast, patients with chromosome abnormalities evolved into myelofibrosis with a high incidence compared with those with normal karyotypes (14.6% versus 2.4%, P = 0.054). The occurrence of myelofibrosis was higher during the first 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS than in the next 6 months (6.1% versus 0%, P = 0.045). Most of the MDS patients survived for less than 10 months after myelofibrosis was evident. Furthermore, survival was significantly shorter in Group I compared with Groups II (P less than 0.05) and III (P less than 0.01). Among the MDS patients in whom myelofibrosis developed, some were associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, indicating a heterogeneity of clinical features in MDS with myelofibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether the increase in disease-free survival and survival previously reported for women with melanomas with estrogen receptors (ER) was a reflection of the histopathology of the primary melanoma, the interrelationship of histopathologic characteristics of 143 patients with such tumors was examined. The ER was assayed in the primary tumor from 44 patients and in 99 metastatic deposits from the other patients. Tumor thickness, level of invasion, prognostic index, mitoses/mm2, ulceration, vascular invasion, necrosis, histologic grade, preexisting nevus, and predominant malignant cell type were examined. There was no relationship between ER presence and any histopathologic characteristic examined, irrespective of the tumor source (primary or metastatic). Examination of histopathologic characteristics as a function of sex and receptor status showed a slight but insignificant predominance of more well-differentiated, thinner tumors in women whose lesions were positive for the ER. These results suggest that the increased disease-free survival in patients with ER-positive lesions is not attributable to the pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor examined during this study.\r"

Second primary head and neck tumors were more likely to be diagnosed in a localized stage (47%) than if diagnosed as a single primary tumor (43%), but this difference was not significant. The tumor grade distribution was comparable in both groups. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with age, sex, race, and stage as covariates, the median survival of patients with first and second head and neck cancer was identical (50 months). The survival of patients with localized second head and neck cancer was shorter than that of patients with single localized tumors (55 versus 102 months, P less than 0.026). Survival for regional tumors was similar (18 versus 21 months, not significant). The 84 second head and neck cancers in which the first head and neck cancer received radiation therapy (RT) had a median survival of 20 months; the 98 cases without prior RT had a median survival of 35 months. The high incidence of localized second cancers was probably due to the more intense surveillance. The worse survival in this group may be a result of prior RT or biologic characteristics of the tumor.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the metabolism of the drug was evaluated in a case control study. The subjects were characterized by their ability to metabolize debrisoquine after receiving a test dose of the drug followed by the collection of an 8-hour urine sample. They were classified by laboratory analysis into one of the following three groups: extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers. Poor metabolizers comprise 10% of the population and are unable to hydroxylate the drug. This group was expected to be at highest risk for deleterious effects from this medication. A protocol was created that included patient education and blood pressure monitoring to administer this medication safely to a group of patients with cancer who were already compromised. Although poor metabolizers showed a small decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, no significant hypotensive episodes or clinical sequelae were observed in any of the groups. These data suggest that debrisoquine can be administered safely in a controlled clinical setting and will be useful for the characterization of lung cancer patients in biochemical epidemiology studies.\r"

Emphasis was placed on diagnostic reliability; 97% of cases were confirmed histologically, and of these, 86% were reviewed at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. For the years 1982 to 1985, Victorian Cancer Registry data were used. The incidence rose by a factor of 2.9 from 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.73) per 100,000 in 1950 to 1954 to 4.16 (95% CI, 3.73 to 4.59) per 100,000 in 1982 to 1985. Between 1950 to 1954 and 1965 to 1969, there was a sharp rise, followed by a plateau or dip, then a further rise. Among seminomas, the rates rose in most adult age groups, whereas among nonseminomas, the rise was concentrated in younger age groups. There was a significant trend to earlier age of occurrence among nonseminomas (P = 0.0004) but not among seminomas (P = 0.89). Cohort analysis revealed a trend toward increasing rates for both seminomas and nonseminomas, and confirmed the trend toward earlier age of onset for nonseminomas. Disproportionate increases were observed for the 1915 to 1924 cohort of seminomas and the 1930 to 1939 cohort of nonseminomas. Analysis of available data from other Australian states indicated comparable rising incidence in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia.\r"

All patients were given chemotherapy consisting of procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine (CCNU) (PVC). Half of the patients received whole-brain irradiation (RT) to a dose of 5800 cGy in the tumor-bearing hemisphere and 5000 cGy in the contralateral hemisphere. After diagnosis of progressive tumor growth, patients received individual treatment. The endpoint of the study was time to progression, but cases were followed until the patients died. Median time to progression (MTP) for the whole randomized population was 21 weeks. Median survival time (MST) was 53 weeks; 18% of patients survived for 2 years or longer. Survival analysis showed that patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer MTP (81 weeks) and MST (124 weeks) than all other patients. For patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC alone, MTP was 21 weeks and MST was 66 weeks. For patients more than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT, MTP was 23 weeks and MST was 51 weeks; in the PVC group, MTP was 17 weeks and MST was 39 weeks. Age, Karnofsky index, areas of Grade 2, and absence of extensive necrosis in the tumor were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analyses. Patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer survival (P = 0.037) when correcting for these factors in a multi-variate analysis.\r"

Median duration of response and survival were 12 months (range, 2 to 96+ months) and 15 months (range, 5 to 96+ months), respectively. Seven of the 16 complete remissions were pathologically confirmed at subsequent thoracotomy. Other chemotherapy combinations and radiation therapy have been applied as second-line treatment, achieving only minimal responses.

Considering 256 patients with measurable or evaluable disease, objective responses were seen in 48 (38%) of 126 TAM patients and 61 (47%) of 130 TAM plus PRDLN patients (chi-square, P = 0.15). Considering all 320 evaluated patients, median time to disease progression was 11 months for TAM and 10 months for TAM plus PRDLN (log rank, P = 0.81), and median survival time was 35 and 32 months, respectively (P = 0.40). Covariate analyses showed no significant association between treatment and outcome. Weight gain and edema were significantly greater with TAM plus PRDLN. The addition of PRDLN to TAM is not advocated for the management of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.\r"

Ninety-two courses of CBDCA were administered and one treatment-related death occurred. The main toxicity was myelosuppression. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (hemoglobin level, less than 8 g/dl; granulocyte count, less than 1900/microliters; and platelet count, less than 49,000/microliters) was observed as follows: neutropenia in 7 courses (8%) and in 7 patients (28%), decreased hemoglobin level in 13 courses (15%) and in 7 patients (28%), and decreased platelet count in 10 courses (11%) all Grade 3 and in 8 patients (32%). This study demonstrates that at this dose and schedule CBDCA is a highly active drug in ESSCLC and it has tolerable toxicity.\r"

In April 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) adopted for these patients an intensive treatment protocol (POG 8303) consisting of a four-drug systemic reinduction (prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase), a brief intensive consolidation phase with teniposide and cytarabine, and a 2-year program of continuation chemotherapy with weekly rotating drug pairs (vincristine/cyclophosphamide and teniposide/cytarabine) with or without (by randomization) four-drug reinforcement pulses every 16 weeks. Bilateral testicular radiation (2600 cGy) was administered during reinduction, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis was given every 4 to 6 weeks. Among 38 eligible study patients with OTR, 5 had prior or concominant extramedullary relapse in other sites. The median duration of complete remission before OTR was 27 months (range, 10 to 42 months). All 38 patients achieved clinical remission after reinduction. Three patients withdrew while in remission, 22 had another relapse (12 marrow, 5 central nervous system (CNS), 2 testicular, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 prostate, and 1 eye), and 13 (34%) remain in complete remission from 32+ to 74+ months after OTR (median, 53+ months). Eighteen patients had their therapy electively discontinued, and five relapses occurred thereafter. These results are superior to those observed in patients with first marrow relapse treated with the same protocol. Approximately one third of patients with OTR treated with POG protocol 8303 exhibit prolonged second remissions with the potential for cure.\r"

Therapeutic responses, obtained in 31.2% (SWOG) and 68.7% (TF) of patients, had a significant inverse correlation with myeloma cell mass, serum calcium, and bone status. Median survival time of Stage II and Stage III patients was 39 and 34 months, respectively. Serum B2 microglobulin greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml was the only variable correlating unfavorably with survival duration after multi-variate analysis (increased risk = 2.79), although therapeutic response as a time-dependent variable had no effect on survival. These data suggest no correlation between response and survival, partially because of inadequate response assessment criteria and partially because no existing treatment is curative (although current therapeutic approaches may prevent death from complications).\r"

The objective of the trial was to establish the optimal dose rate and cumulative dose for this treatment schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia observed. The optimal dose rate for the 5-day infusion was 75 mg/m2/d or a total cumulative dose of 375 mg/m2/d. The optimal dose rate for the 14-day infusion was 25 mg/m2/d or a total cumulative dose of 350 mg/m2/d. The times to nadir levels of leukocyte and platelet counts were 34 days and 25 days, respectively, with a median time to recovery of 14 days and 7 days, respectively, in patients with Grade 3 or greater marrow suppression. The pattern of hematologic toxicity with infusional CBDCA is comparable to that seen with bolus schedules. There is, therefore, no clinical advantage of the infusional schedule for CBDCA in terms of toxicity and the dose delivered per cycle, and the dose intensity is slightly less than with a bolus schedule. If there is a therapeutic advantage for the infusional schedule, a prospective comparative trial against the standard bolus schedule will be required to establish it. Bolus and infusional schedules for CBDCA are associated with a delayed pattern of thrombocytopenia and prolonged leukopenia, necessitating 5 or more weeks between treatment cycles.\r"

Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma. The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects. A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide. Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae. Death from irreversible encephalopathy has also been reported rarely. The authors believe that classic extrapyramidal symptoms should be considered to be a part of the neurotoxic profile of ifosfamide.\r"

The authors attempted to correlate changes in DNA content, tumor response to RT, and post-RT pathologic findings. Before RT, tumors from eight of 30 patients (26.7%) were diploid or near-diploid; tumors from 22 patients (73.3%) were aneuploid. After RT, diploid or near-diploid tumors were found in 23 patients (76.7%), and aneuploid tumors were observed in seven patients (23.3%). Aneuploidy disappeared in 15 of the patient tumors, and complete tumor response (CR) was observed in 13 of these 15 patients (86.7%). Pathologic examinations were negative in 12 of 15 cases and suspicious in one of 15 cases. Of the seven patients whose tumor aneuploidy did not change after RT, CR was observed in only two (28.7%). Pathologic examinations were positive in five of seven cases and suspicious in one of seven cases. The CR for the 22 patients with pre-RT aneuploid tumors was 15 of 22 (68.2%); the CR for the eight patients with pre-RT diploid tumors was two of eight (25%, P less than 0.01). From these data the authors conclude there is a direct correlation between DNA content and radiosensitivity in cervical carcinoma. Aneuploid tumors from these patients were more radiosensitive than diploid tumors, and they patients had a better clinical tumor response and improved pathologic findings.\r"

Because of the potential myelosuppressive side effects of 5-FC it was the aim of the current study to evaluate the recovery of hematopoietic cells after intensive antileukemic therapy in patients receiving ampho B and 5-FC treatment for proven or suspected systemic fungal infections. The study population comprised 87 patients who were treated by standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis or relapse. Twenty-two patients underwent systemic antifungal therapy consisting of ampho B (3 to 10 mg/kg/d) and 5-FC (150 mg/kg/d) for 3 to 33 days (median, 12 days). The remaining 65 patients served as controls to assess the hematologic recovery time (TR) as defined by the interval between the onset of chemotherapy and the post-treatment rise of granulocyte levels to greater than 500 cmm and thrombocyte levels to greater than 20,000 cmm. In patients receiving antifungal therapy, a significant prolongation of TR was observed with a median TR of 29 days compared with a median TR of 24 days (P = 0.0016) for the control group. No correlation was found between TR and the total dose of either ampho B or 5-FC or the type of antileukemic regimen. A possibly direct myelosuppressive effect of a fungal infection was unlikely to explain the findings because the ampho B/5-FC treatment was started in patients with proven or only suspected fungal infections, causing a similar delay of TR in both groups. The present data strongly suggest a myelosuppressive effect of ampho B/5-FC antifungal treatment in patients after intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemias.\r"

The CK8 was not detected in tumor cells of two cases of hepatic angiosarcoma, two of metastatic leiomyosarcomas, and one of metastatic fibrosarcoma, although vimentin stained positively in all these true sarcomas. It was concluded that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of liver carcinomas might derive from both HCC and CCC.

Eleven tumors reacted with vimentin antibodies, two with carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies, and ten with neuron-specific enolase (NSE) antibodies (four of which stained for bombesin, two for beta-endorphin, one for prealbumin, five for Leu7, and four for synaptophysin).

  ".W": "Medical therapy for obesity is still unsuccessful in the majority of patients at five-year follow-up. Physicians should not become discouraged, however, because the number of successful participants in weight loss programs is increasing. An effective medical weight loss program requires five basic elements: (1) an effective means of caloric restriction, either a balance of fuel sources in patients who are less than 30% above ideal body weight, or a very-low-calorie diet in patients with obesity that is a significant threat to their health; (2) extensive nutritional instruction, to enable the patient to make wise food choices that are varied and palatable; (3) an individual exercise program sufficient to maintain the patient's goal weight on maintenance food; (4) behavioral modification, to allow patients to control their food consumption; and (5) a mechanism for continuing support. Now that low-fat diets and very-low-calorie diets allow effective means of safe and rapid weight loss, progress must be made in preventing weight regain. Obesity is a lifelong disease, with remissions followed by relapses. Long-term therapeutic success depends on the rapid reinstitution of therapy by a nonjudgemental support team when a relapse occurs.\r"

Energy expenditure increases linearly with the extent of burn injury, reaching a plateau of twice resting energy expenditure when 50% of the total body surface area is involved. It is therefore essential to minimize other factors that may further augment postburn catabolism. Occlusive dressings, a warm ambient environment, analgesics, and timely closure of the burn wound are all important therapeutic measures in this regard. Furthermore, it is imperative to institute early nutritional support in order to offset the negative metabolic effects of severe burn injury.\r"

Serum laboratory findings included elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin. Radiographical evaluations showed no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral infections, and serum copper was normal. The patient's condition deteriorated over the ensuing 17 days, with hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia and a rapid fall in serum aminotransferases with a concomitant rise in bilirubin level and prothrombin time despite maximal medical support. The liver volume as shown by computed tomography fell from 1,290 cm3 to 680 cm3 over 6 days. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation 25 days after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of the resected liver showed submassive and massive necrosis, with a few foci of microvesicular steatosis and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Although we found insufficient evidence to prove that this case was caused by isoflurane anesthesia, the clinical course and histopathological findings are similar to those in hepatic injury caused by halothane anesthesia. Therefore we report this as a possible case of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from isoflurane anesthesia.\r"

Interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts and the immunoreactive protein were abundant in liver tissue and in particular in hepatocytes from patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection who subsequently recovered. In contrast interferon-alpha polypeptide was present in a significantly lower number of sinusoidal cells, mononuclear cells and hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Although a high proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection had cells that expressed interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts, the number of such cells was significantly less than in acute hepatitis B virus infection, indicating that the defect in the hepatic interferon-alpha synthesis is at the level of gene activation. Furthermore, using double immunohistochemical staining, the number of hepatocytes containing HBcAg correlated inversely with the proportion of neighboring sinusoidal cells expressing interferon-alpha. These data support previous observations that interferon-alpha production is reduced in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and are consistent with the view that this cytokine is important in the clearance of the virus.\r"

Twelve children received 10 MU of interferon-alpha 2b/m2 body surface area three times a week (group I); 12 children received 5 MU/m2 under the same conditions (group II); and 12 children served as controls (group III). During 6 mo of therapy, 12 of 24 (50%) treated patients (7 from group I, 58%, and 5 from group II, 42%) and 2 of 12 (17%) controls lost hepatitis B virus DNA from serum and subsequently remained negative. Comparison of the rate of response in group I vs. controls showed a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Eleven of 12 (92%) treated patients who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum lost HBeAg, seroconverted to anti-HBe and had improvement in liver histological findings with loss of hepatitis B virus DNA from liver. In 10, serum ALT levels became normal. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated and all children finished therapy. These findings indicate that a 6-mo course of interferon-alpha is effective in inducing a serological, biochemical and histological remission of disease in approximately 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B.\r"

This technique uses a high-affinity monoclonal antibody to HBs against an a domain epitope of HBsAg to capture the virion, followed by hepatitis B virus DNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 55 subjects without liver disease served as controls: Group 3 (n = 32) was negative for all hepatitis B virus markers; group 4 (n = 23) was positive for antibodies to HBs and HBc. We found 11 individuals in group 1 (31%) and 10 in group 2 (29%) harboring low levels of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. In contrast, no one in group 3 or group 4 was positive by this technique (p less than 0.0001). Using polymerase chain reaction primers spanning other regions of the hepatitis B virus genome and a method of restriction-fragment analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified sequences, we detected significant DNA sequence heterogeneity, suggesting infection with distinct hepatitis B virus strains. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded liver biopsy specimens of 42 patients from groups 1 and 2 was shown to contain hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in 11 of 12 patients with circulating virion DNA. More important, 18 additional patients whose sera were negative by HBs-antibody capture/polymerase chain reaction amplification had hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in their livers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the end of the 12-mo study, all patients were followed-up for 12 additional months. Normalization or decrease of more than 50% from baseline of serum ALT levels occurred in 42% of treated patients the fourth month of therapy, 26% the twelfth month and 3% the twenty-fourth month vs. 7%, 7% and 0%, respectively, in the control group. However, relapses occurred in 7 of 8 (87.5%) responders 1 to 10 mo (mean = 3.5 mo) after cessation of therapy. Liver biopsies were carried out at baseline and during the twelfth month of treatment. Histological improvement, mostly caused by decrease of portal inflammation, was observed in 57% of treated and 36% of untreated patients. Measures of antiviral activity (serum hepatitis delta virus RNA and intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen) showed similar levels in treated and control patients. In treated patients the percentage of patients who were negative for HDV RNA never exceeded that of baseline. Although interferon-alpha in the dosage given in this study had no antiviral effect on patients with chronic hepatitis D, it reduced hepatic inflammation as measured by ALT levels. Whether a longer duration or reinstitution of interferon-alpha therapy would achieve long-term control of ALT levels and prevent chronic liver damage is not known.\r"

A positive correlation was seen between the height of aminotransferase elevations and the percentage of large HBeAg. Three patients who progressed from histologically normal liver or nonspecific reactive hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis had dramatic increases in the percentage of large HBeAg. The finding that the presence of large HBeAg in serum correlated with the severity of hepatitis suggests that HBeAg may play an important role in determining the degree of liver injury in chronic hepatitis B.\r"

Ten patients had hilar involvement (group I), and seven patients had posterior localization (five of them had chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome) (group II). The delay between diagnosis and the orthotopic liver transplantation was more than 48 mo in group Ia (six patients), less than 24 mo in group Ib (four patients) and less than 48 mo in group II. Previous operations were more common in group Ia than in group Ib and II. Five patients have died-four in group I and one in group II. The actuarial survival rate at 15 mo was 75%. Early reoperations were frequent (69%), mainly caused by rebleeding. Bacterial and fungal infections occurred only in group Ia (four cases) and group II (three cases). In eight patients (palliative group), residual foci of infected nonhepatic tissue occurred after surgery. The titer of specific antibodies decreased during the first 3 mo in all the patients but one. In patients with radical liver transplantation, the complete disappearance of specific antibodies occurred within 2 yr in four cases. In the remaining five patients, specific antibodies remained detectable, but no evidence of recurrence has been obtained up to now. In the palliative group, a peak of specific IgM occurred at 3 mo; an increase of specific IgG was observed later. The growth of residual parasitic foci was relatively slow, and all these patients remained asymptomatic with a mean follow-up of 19 mo. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation is feasible in incurable alveolar echinococcosis and could be proposed without delay to patients with parasitic Budd-Chiari syndrome or complicated secondary biliary cirrhosis. In the other cases, the best time to perform an orthotopic liver transplantation is more difficult to determine. Nevertheless, in the perspective of an orthotopic liver transplantation, the management of these patients has to change, and repetitive laparotomies for palliative surgical procedures have to be replaced by interventional radiology.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the pathogenetic role of acetaldehyde in the development of alcoholic liver disease, genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes was performed and the clinical features of the alcoholic liver disease patients with different genotypes were compared. Genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 was performed in 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease using the polymerase chain reaction and slot-blot hybridization. Of the 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease, 40 were homozygous for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene and the remaining seven cases were heterozygous for the normal and mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. No homozygote was found for the mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. Daily alcohol intake was less than 100 gm in all heterozygotes without relation to the type of alcoholic liver disease. On the other hand, all but four patients homozygotic for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene drank more than 100 gm alcohol/day. The mean daily alcohol intake in the heterozygotes was significantly lower than that in the normal homozygotes. The incidence of alcoholic fibrosis tended to be lower in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes (14.2% vs. 52.5%). On the other hand, the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis tended to be higher in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes. These results indicate that alcoholic liver disease develops even with moderate amounts of alcohol intake in heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes, in which acetaldehyde metabolism in the liver is impaired and liver damage in the heterozygotes is more severe than that in the normal homozygotes, suggesting that habitual drinkers who are heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes may be at high risk for alcoholic liver disease.\r"

A detailed study of bile acid metabolism in this patient was carried out in the anicteric and icteric phases before and after ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) administration. Urinary, biliary and serum bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. During the anicteric phase the daily urinary excretion and serum concentrations of bile acids were within normal ranges, indicating normal hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids during the cholestasis-free period. Only slight qualitative differences from normal individuals were observed; the relative proportions of deoxycholic acid in the bile and serum were higher, and 12-oxo-lithocholic acid was the predominant urinary bile acid. During the icteric phase a marked increase in the urinary excretion of primary bile acids and C-1, C-2, C-4 and C-6 hydroxylated metabolites was found. Serum bile acid concentrations increased before the rise in bilirubin, suggesting an acute disturbance in bile acid transport at the onset of the cholestatic attack. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration in the anicteric phase, bile became enriched with the exogenous bile acid, but little qualitative change was found in the other metabolites present in the urine, serum or bile during the anicteric or icteric phases. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid failed to prevent recurrence of a cholestatic episode, suggesting that in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, oral ursodeoxycholic acid may be of little benefit in the treatment or prevention of cholestasis despite marked enrichment of the bile acid pool with this hydrophilic bile acid.\r"

Eighteen patients with pruritus that appeared during pregnancy and with elevated serum levels of bile salts (68.1 +/- 15.9 mumol/L; mean +/- S.E.M.) and ALT (226 +/- 50 KU/L) were enrolled in a prospective double-blind study comparing the effects of the drug with a placebo. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine, 900 mg, or placebo was administered in daily intravenous infusions for 20 days. Every 5 days liver function tests were done and pruritus was assessed using a preestablished score. No significant differences in pruritus or in serum levels of bile salts, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatases were seen during or after treatment between patients who received S-adenosyl-L-methionine (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9). No relevant adverse reactions were detected. Most patients had cesarean sections because of reasons unrelated to the therapeutic trial. All newborns had Apgar scores greater than 7 and normal postnatal development. Our patients had moderately severe to severe cholestasis of pregnancy as indicated by the onset of pruritus before wk 32 of pregnancy. Seven of nine multiparous patients had a past history of recurrent cholestasis of pregnancy. In this study, the administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine during 20 days did not improve intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relationship between selected variables of hepatic and pulmonary function in 47 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were participating in a prospective study to assess sequential pulmonary function at yearly intervals. An additional 20 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were liver transplant candidates awaiting transplantation, were studied. None of the 67 patients ever smoked cigarettes. Severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was characterized by histological stage and the Mayo risk score derived from a Cox regression model that used the following variables: serum bilirubin and serum albumin levels, age, prothrombin time and clinical severity of edema. Pulmonary function assessment included key variables describing expiratory airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec divided by forced vital capacity) and efficiency of gas exchange (steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide). We found a significant relationship between histological stage of primary biliary cirrhosis and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.02) and between the Mayo risk score for disease severity and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.03). Progressive deterioration of steady-state diffusing capacity was associated with increasing severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. No relationship existed between pulmonary function and the presence of sicca complex or Sjogren's syndrome or the clinical manifestations of portal hypertension (e.g., esophageal varices, ascites and splenomegaly). No significant relationship existed between expiratory airflow and severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. We conclude that in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who have never smoked, a statistically significant relationship exists between the severity of the liver disease and the efficiency of gas exchange measured by steady-state diffusing capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The changes in blood lymphocyte phenotype in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were similar and comprised elevated relative or absolute numbers of activated human leukocyte antigen-DR + T subset (CD4+ and CD8+) cells and DR+ natural killer-like (CD16+) cells. B cell (CD19+) numbers were normal. In primary biliary cirrhosis a selective reduction in T cells of suppressor-inducer (CD45RA + CD4 + ) type was registered. The human leukocyte antigen-DR expression among CD4+ T cell subsets was investigated further in primary biliary cirrhosis and healthy controls using triple antibody flow cytometric analysis. Phenotypical cell activation was confined to helper T cells of the primed, memory (CD45RO + CD4+) type. The decrease in suppressor-inducer T cells in primary biliary cirrhosis was paralleled by a reciprocal increase in primed memory T cells. Several significant differences were observed when blood and liver-infiltrating cells from primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared. In the liver tissue, the CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased, the relative activation of T-subset cells and NK cells was further increased, the suppressor-inducer T subset was further depressed and the primed memory T subset was increased. The cytotoxic T-cell subset (CD11b-) dominated within the CD8+ population. In liver tissue from other chronic liver disease subjects, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio was found compared with primary biliary cirrhosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Peak C in most hepatocellular carcinoma patients was higher than that in healthy controls. Similar profiles were detected with epidermal growth factor radioreceptor assay and cellular DNA synthesis assay. This result might indicate that transforming growth factors with low molecular weight were found in the urine of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. An exceptional HCC patient had an additional peak (A') that corresponded to the high molecular weight protein. We concluded that there were transforming growth factors with functional activity in the urine of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is known that eosinophils consistently infiltrate rejecting human liver allografts, their function is unknown. Infiltrating eosinophils can release a cytotoxic substance, eosinophil cationic protein. Furthermore, eosinophil cationic protein may be identified in biopsy specimens using immunoperoxidase staining of an eosinophil cationic protein-specific monoclonal antibody. To study a possible effector role of eosinophils in rejecting liver allografts, 38 serial allograft biopsy specimens from 12 patients with acute rejection, 54 biopsy specimens from 11 patients with allograft dysfunction caused by other causes and 22 biopsy specimens from 8 patients without allograft dysfunction were stained for extracellular eosinophil cationic protein. In addition, the absolute blood eosinophil counts and the portal tract eosinophil percent of the total number of portal tract inflammatory cells were tabulated in these patients until 30 days after transplantation. The blood absolute eosinophil count, portal tract eosinophil percent and incidence of positive extracellular eosinophil cationic protein staining were significantly increased in patients with rejection compared with patients with dysfunction from other causes (p less than 0.05 to 0.005, t test). Furthermore, each of these parameters predicted rejection with excellent sensitivity (75% to 92%) and specificity (91% to 100%). Of patients with rejection, 59% had significant elevation of all three parameters before or during rejection, and 92% had at least two parameters elevated. Conversely, of the patients with dysfunction from other causes, 0% had elevations of any parameter. The recognized cytotoxic properties of eosinophil cationic protein and its almost exclusive presence, along with eosinophils in the blood and allograft biopsy specimens of patients during acute rejection, support the role of the eosinophil as an effector cell in tissue injury during acute liver allograft rejection.\r"

Glucagon (10(-6) mol/L) increased endogenous ketone body production by 150%. This resulted from alterations in the partition of long-chain fatty acids from esterification toward oxidation. Glucagon or cyclic AMP enhanced (14C) oleate oxidation (basal = 45.8% +/- 5.0%; glucagon = 66.8% +/- 5.3%; cyclic AMP = 67.6% +/- 5.0% of metabolized oleate) at the expense of oleate esterification. Insulin (10(-7) mol/L) antagonized the glucagon-induced oleate oxidation. After 24 hr in basal culture conditions, the rate of lipogenesis decreased to the same low rate as in glucagon-treated cells. The presence of insulin did not restore a high rate of lipogenesis. These results are the first direct evidence of a control of ketone body production by glucagon in the human liver.\r"

Addition of interleukin-6 to the cultures resulted in strong induction of C-reactive protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin expression, whereas albumin expression was repressed. In contrast to interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta did not induce C-reactive protein expression. However, as in adult hepatocytes, fetal cells responded to transforming growth factor-beta by reduced albumin synthesis. We were able to show by virtue of fluorescein excretion into sealed clefts that fetal hepatocytes have the functional capacity to form bile. Our findings indicate that second-trimester hepatocytes can be regarded as fairly mature liver cells.\r"

A single intravenous injection of murine ascites containing a monoclonal antibody produced numerous hemorrhagic foci of degenerated and necrotic liver cells predominantly in zones 1 (the periportal area) and 2 (the area of transition between the periportal zone and the perivenular zone) of the liver lobule within 10 min. Massive hepatocellular necroses were observed 1 hr later, but no inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in and around the necrotic foci. Immunohistological study demonstrated marked deposition of the third component of the complement system in the necrotic area. Serum complement activity was sharply decreased immediately after the injection of the antibody, suggesting that the hepatic necrosis is ascribable to a complement-mediated immune attack on the liver cell membrane induced by the antigen-antibody reaction. The hepatic necrosis in response to monoclonal-antibody injection did not progress to a chronic disease and healed almost completely, changing to scar tissues within 2 wk. Although it is not clear whether this hepatic injury has any clinical relevance, this antibody/complement model may be useful for investigating the cause and therapy of hepatic diseases such as fulminant hepatitis.\r"

To test whether this improvement is related to better preservation of the endothelial cell, which is thought to be the most vulnerable cell type in cold storage, we compared time-related ultrastructural changes in rat livers stored in this solution or in Euro-Collins solution. Rat livers were harvested after combined arterial and portal perfusion with the cold-storage solution. They were then preserved for different lengths of time in the same solution at 4 degrees C before being perfusion-fixed and processed for light and electron microscopy. The first preservation damage was noted in endothelial cells; the time course of the lesions was similar in both solutions. After 2 hr of storage, enlarged and ruptured fenestrae with many gaps were observed. Swollen at 4 hr, the endothelial cells became stringlike at 10 hr, leading to stripped sinusoidal walls. Hepatocytes appeared better preserved in University of Wisconsin solution. The amount of glycogen, maintained near the control level at 24 hr in the latter, decreased dramatically between 0 and 4 hr in Euro-Collins solution, as ultrastructurally observed and biochemically confirmed. Furthermore, sinusoidal obstruction by blebs originating from the hepatocytes and quantified by image analysis on electron micrographs was markedly delayed. It was significantly less pronounced in University of Wisconsin solution at 24 hr than in Euro-Collins solution at 2 hr (p less than or equal to 0.05). Our findings confirm that endothelial cells are highly susceptible to preservation damage and show that University of Wisconsin solution does not improve preservation during storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with placebo-treated rats, linsidomine-treated animals were found to have a significant decrease in portal venous pressure (-18%, p less than 0.01) and in mean arterial pressure (-16%, p less than 0.01), smaller peripheral resistances (p less than 0.01), greater portal venous inflow (p less than 0.05), smaller splanchnic arteriolar resistances (p less than 0.01) and smaller protocol-lateral resistances (p less than 0.05). Cardiac output, hepatic arterial blood flow, portal blood flow and estimated hepatic blood flow were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Linsidomine-treated rats exhibited a trend toward greater collateral blood flow compared with controls, but this difference was not significant. We conclude that linsidomine decreases portal venous pressure by reducing portocollateral resistances without affecting liver blood flow. These effects should be beneficial for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\r"

However, ethanol may also induce changes in membrane fatty acid composition, which could reduce the risk of peroxidative damage. This study examined lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defense and fatty acid composition in livers from miniature pigs fed ethanol in diets containing 12% of their calories as fat for 20 mo. After 12 and 20 mo of feeding, ethanol-fed pigs had higher hepatic manganese-superoxide dismutase activity, lower hepatic copper concentrations and low hepatic copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities compared with controls. Lipid peroxidation as assessed by thiobarbituric acid reacting substance assay was lower in liver homogenate and mitochondrial and microsomal fractions from ethanol-fed pigs than in controls. The percentage contribution of highly unsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids in liver homogenates (after 12 mo of feeding) and microsome fractions (after 20 mo of feeding) was lower in the ethanol-fed pigs than in the controls, resulting in a lower peroxidizability index. Ethanol-fed pigs had minimal or no hepatic damage as assessed by histological methods. We suggest that the relative resistance of microsomes to lipid peroxidation is due to the lower peroxidizability index in the ethanol-fed pigs and may account in part for the absence of significant histopathological findings after 20 mo of ethanol feeding.\r"

Fat-storing cells were identified in cryostat sections by immunoperoxidase staining of desmin. The peroxidase label was visualized using diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide containing Ni2+ and Co(2+)-ions (Nico/diaminobenzidine method). In normal rats, we found 12.8 fat-storing cells/0.1 mm2 in periportal areas vs. 9.4 in pericentral fields. After one injection of CCl4, the number of pericentral cells increased gradually to reach a maximum of 39.4 cells/0.1 mm2 96 hr after injection. The desmin staining intensity of the pericentral fat-storing cells increased from 48 hr onward. At 72 to 120 hr, strongly stained cells were observed in pericentral areas and in bands of tissue between adjacent central veins, reminiscent of the connective tissue septa in fibrotic livers. In the periportal areas the number of fat-storing cells was not altered. After a second and third injection of CCl4, the number of cells increased further in the pericentral areas. When more than three injections were given, the pericentral fat-storing cell population reached a new steady state with the cell number being seven times higher than in control animals. Proliferation of fat-storing cells at different stages of CCl4 intoxication was studied by intravenous administration of 3H-thymidine, followed by combined desmin staining and autoradiography. Autoradiographical labeling of fat-storing cells was nearly absent in control animals and at 24 hr after a single CCl4 injection. At 48 to 96 hr, labeling indices of pericentral fat-storing cells were significantly higher than in control animals, with a maximum at 72 hr when 22.9% of the cells were labeled. After multiple injections of CCl4, labeling indices between 4.9% and 8.4% were found. We conclude that fibrogenesis is preceded by a strong expansion of the fat-storing cell population in the pericentral areas of the liver lobules and in bands of tissue between adjacent central veins. Local proliferation is an important mechanism underlying the expansion of this cell population.\r"

  ".W": "We used compartmental modeling to describe taurocholate transport by isolated rat liver cells in suspension. Cells are preincubated in the presence of unlabeled taurocholate. When a steady-state for taurocholate is reached, radiolabeled taurocholate is added to the medium and its exchange kinetics between the medium and the cells are followed over time. Because the studies are performed under steady-state conditions, the kinetics can be described by linear compartmental models. We found a closed two-compartment model sufficient to describe the steady-state transport data. Simulations reveal that if the pools of free and bound intracellular taurocholate exchange rapidly, the cells will behave as a single, kinetically homogeneous compartment and intracellular events will not influence the exchange kinetics of taurocholate between the medium and the cells. The two-compartment model was used to study the concentration dependence of taurocholate transport by isolated cells. Steady-state transport rates and taurocholate concentrations in the medium and the cells were calculated using the model equations. Taurocholate influx, accumulation and efflux processes were studied simultaneously by examining the relationship between appropriate combinations of these variables. Application of this approach to study the inhibition of taurocholate transport by taurochenodeoxycholate is illustrated. In conclusion, this method provides a complementary approach to initial rate studies, which are generally used to investigate bile acid transport by isolated cells.\r"

  ".W": "During studies of seasonal obesity, a high frequency of hepatic neoplasms was observed in Richardson's ground squirrels. Of 12 Richardson's ground squirrels examined thoroughly, 7 had mild or moderate degrees of chronic portal hepatitis and 6 (50%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serological tests for hepadnavirus surface antigen, anti-core antibody and virion DNA that recognize the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were uniformly negative. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI digests of liver cell DNA demonstrated 3.2 kb fragments that hybridized with a ground squirrel hepatitis virus-specific probe in nontumorous liver tissue from 6 of 10 ground squirrels and in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 2 of 5 squirrels indicating infection with a hepadnavirus related to ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Failure, however, to detect serum antibody to ground squirrel hepatitis core antigen suggested probable antigenic differences between the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels and the putative Richardson's ground squirrel agent. Further studies are required to fully characterize the hepadnavirus of Richardson's ground squirrels and to determine its relationship to hepatocarcinogenesis in this species.\r"

In this study, the glucuronidation of various bile acids after high-dose infusion into rats was examined and the effects of coinfusion of bile acids on the glucuronidation of a trace dose of [14C]deoxycholate were also studied. Sixty minutes after infusion of 14C-bile acids at a rate of 1 mumol/min/100 gm, the glucuronidation of the labeled bile acid in the bile was 31%, 15%, 8% and 3% for deoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate and cholate, respectively. The infusion of a trace dose of [14C] deoxycholate resulted in only 2% glucuronidation, and coinfusion of taurochenodeoxycholate or tauroursodeoxycholate at a rate of 1 mumol/min/100 gm did not change the percentage of glucuronidation of [14C]deoxycholate. However, coinfusion of chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate or cholate at the same rate markedly increased the percentage of the [14C]deoxycholate-glycuronide in the bile (35%, 18% and 36%, respectively). Thus glucuronidation of bile acids by high-dose infusion into rats occurs predominantly with deoxycholate and is not specific for ursodeoxycholate, and glucuronidation depends on the unconjugated bile acid load, which might be regulated by the capacity of amidation by the liver.\r"

Because the organochlorine compound mirex also causes liver cell growth, the purpose of this study was to investigate hepatic carbohydrate and oxygen metabolism in perfused livers from mirex-treated rats and to localize cell proliferation in this model. Pretreatment with mirex (100 mg/kg, intragastrically) increased liver/body weight ratios and DNA synthesis in livers of fed rats, effects that were markedly diminished in livers of fasted rats. This finding shows that liver growth caused by mirex, as is the case after partial hepatectomy, is hindered when animals are deprived of food. Furthermore, perfused livers from mirex-treated rats had depleted glycogen stores but significantly elevated oxygen uptake compared with livers from control rats. Increases in oxygen uptake and hepatocellular proliferation were observed mostly in periportal regions of the liver lobule. In regenerating livers, most DNA synthesis was reported to also occur in these regions of the liver lobule. Taken together, these data show that liver cell growth caused by mirex is accompanied by changes in hepatic intermediary metabolism and sublobular proliferation similar to those observed after partial hepatectomy.\r"

The pilot study indicated that the substance was effective mostly in patients who originally suffered from migraine. In a patient with tension headache the substance was less effective. In a second double-blind study on six migraine patients with severe drug-induced headache, the drug was highly effective in ameliorating headache and autonomic disturbances. Blood flow velocities measured in extracranial parts of internal and external carotid arteries by duplex-sonography and in middle cerebral and basilar arteries by transcranial Doppler showed no changes after administration of sumatriptan or placebo. This result suggests sumatriptan does not act primarily via constriction of the large cerebral arteries.\r"

This excitation may start as a consequence of information overload to a low threshold cortical area. The transient neuronal excitation is followed by a long-lasting period of reduced cortical flow, which involves a substantial component of active constriction of resistance vessels, even persisting for several hours during the headache phase. When the excitatory wave has reached and activated free pain fiber endings in sufficiently many cortical vessels, off-branching peripheral motor endings of these fibers may become activated via axon reflexes. These motor endings may be located in cortical microvessels or in small vessels around large dural vessels. This leads to a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel walls, experienced as headache by the sufferer. The wall of dural sinuses offers a rational explanation for the beneficial effect of most medications used in migraine.\r"

Results were compared with values measured among age-matched normal volunteers. LCBF values measured in five cluster patients while headache-free did not differ from similar measures among age-matched normal volunteers. In three patients during attacks of spontaneously occurring cluster headache, LCBF values for temporal cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical white matter were increased. Immediately after terminating attacks of cluster by 100% oxygen inhalation for five minutes, LCBF values for temporal cortex and basal ganglia became significantly decreased below normal values in five patients with spontaneously occurring cluster headache. Prompt relief of head pain by inhalation of 100% oxygen is associated with abolition of the hyperperfusion of both cortical and subcortical brain structures that occurs during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches and is followed by excessive cerebrovascular constriction. It remains to be determined whether the cerebral hyperemia occurring during cluster headaches is causally related to the head pain or is secondary to the pain itself. Rapid termination of head pain by hyperoxia associated with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction suggests that this vascular phenomenon is unique to cluster headache and offers clues to its pathogenesis.\r"

In adenylate cyclase studies in bovine substantia nigra, all four abortive anti-migraine agents dose-dependently inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, a biochemical effect mediated by 5-HT1D receptors. No agonist effect on cyclase activity is observed with the four prophylactic anti-migraine agents. These data support the hypothesis that abortive anti-migraine agents are 5-HT1D receptor agonists and that this effect may underlie their anti-migraine efficacy.\r"

We studied the EEG in symptom-free, otherwise healthy, unmedicated 18-28 year-old patients: 22 with common migraine, 20 with classic migraine, and 20 age-matched controls. The routine EEG findings in the three groups revealed mild non-specific slowing in 2 (9%), 3 (15%) and 2 (10%), respectively. Simultaneously, topographic EEG mapping and frequency analysis were performed in 13 consecutive patients with common migraine, 10 patients with classic migraine and 11 age-matched controls. EEG mapping showed minimal regional differences with lower power in the alpha range in patients with eyes closed. The peak alpha power, as well as its reactivity, were lower among patients than controls. This difference reached statistical significance only for patients with classic migraine versus controls in the left occipital region. Patients also had slightly faster peak alpha frequency. No frank right-left asymmetry was observed in the peak alpha power, neither among the controls, nor the patients. All the findings were rather minor. They may suggest some difference in the posterior background activity in the EEG in migraine patients as compared to the controls, but are not useful in differentiating migraine from non-migraine patients.\r"

Most work to date in this area has treated outcome as a dichotomous variable. The present report employed a regression approach which treats outcome (degree of headache relief) as a continuous variable in the study of 149 chronic headache patients and their accompanying psychological changes. Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced for headache patients regardless of degree of headache relief. With somatization, however, degree of headache relief had a significant effect; the greater the reduction in headache, the fewer somatic concerns were expressed, especially for mixed headache.\r"

  ".W": "Thermal injury results in pronounced physiologic alterations in microcirculation at the site of tissue damage. The consequence of these changes is an increase in microvascular permeability, leading to the accumulation of tissue edema, or subeschar tissue fluid (STF). One of the adverse properties of edema is its capacity in vitro to inhibit cell-mediated immune function. Since previous studies evaluated STF collected 5 to 7 days after thermal injury, the present study was designed to determine the time frame during which STF demonstrates its immune suppressive nature. Seven patients with severe thermal injury (30% to 100% total body surface area) were entered into the study. STF was collected in serial fashion, beginning as early as 9 hours after injury and continuing until fascial excision or patient death (maximum of 139 hours after injury). The addition of STF to cultures of lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors resulted in complete inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (MILP). Serum collected concomitantly from this group of patients was also capable of inhibiting MILP. From its inception, STF possesses the ability to inhibit MILP; this suppressive nature is stable, persisting for prolonged periods of time. The gradual absorption of STF likely contributes to the serologic evidence of cell-mediated immune suppression documented in victims of severe thermal injury.\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Polysporin Spray against various clinical isolates. Blood agar plates were inoculated with a pure culture of each isolate. Polysporin was then sprayed in an area approximately 30 mm in diameter. The area of inhibition was measured and recorded after 18 to 24 hours of incubation. A clear zone at least 20 mm in diameter with surrounding edges of growth indicated sensitivity. A zone less than 20 mm in diameter or growth over the whole plate indicated resistance. Three hundred fifty-three clinical isolates (202 gram positive and 151 gram negative) were tested. The results show that Polysporin inhibits the growth of all the gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus. The gram-negative organisms were also sensitive to Polysporin Spray, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis. This study suggests that Polysporin First Aid Antibiotic Spray may be effective for wounds contaminated with gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with burns are unusually susceptible to bacterial infections, but so far there is no satisfactory explanation for this lack of resistance. Since resistance to infection involves many different mechanisms, examination of individual components of the immune system may not sufficiently explain the underlying reasons for increased susceptibility. The use of whole blood for antibacterial tests has the advantage that all the immune systems present in that fluid compartment can take part in the bactericidal effect. Tests with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus showed no evidence that the bactericidal power of the blood and plasma of patients with burns was less than that of normal control plasma. This suggests that the solution to the problem of increased susceptibility to infection in patients with burns does not lie with the blood but must be looked for elsewhere.\r"

Beginning in November 1984, several modifications in the air-conditioning system and topical antimicrobial wound therapy were undertaken. Cleaning and 8Cu-quinolinolate treatment of air ducts every 2 months did not reliably clear Aspergillus species from the air in patient care areas. Several changes in topical therapeutic regimen failed to prevent both burn wound culture positivity and clinical aspergillosis. Finally, installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters, installation of new air ducts, and inception of wound irrigation with a solution of mafenide hydrochloride plus nystatin both during and after operation were associated with a reduction in wound culture positivity rate to one occurrence in 1988 (Poisson probability less than 0.01 versus the rate in 1984) and no occurrences during the 18 months after the false ceiling of the burn ward was sealed.\r"

Twenty-seven percent of patients were acutely intoxicated at the time of injury. Evidence for chronic alcohol abuse was apparent in 90% of intoxicated patients, compared to only 11% of nonintoxicated patients (p = 0.0001). Alcoholic patients with burns not only had an overall mortality rate three times that of nonalcoholics (p = 0.001) but also died of smaller burns (p less than 0.05). Surviving alcoholic patients with burns required significantly more intravenous antibiotics and a longer hospitalization. Social service evaluation of use of alcohol was made in 84% of the cases of surviving intoxicated burn victims. Further intervention was undertaken in two thirds of these cases, usually involving an outpatient treatment program.\r"

Multiple sclerosis is the leading cause of neurologic morbidity and death among young adults. It is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that involves the autonomic and somatic components and is characterized by a primary destruction of myelin. The demyelinated nerves exhibit an increased temperature sensitivity that accounts for the adverse effects of elevated core temperature on the neurologic signs and symptoms of this disease. Because burn injury, infection, and vigorous exercise elicit an elevation of core temperature with an accompanying deterioration in neurologic function, lowering the elevated core body temperature is mandatory. The dysautonomias of multiple sclerosis may be as devastating as their somatic counterparts and may have life-threatening implications. In recent years, advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of central nervous system dysfunction have enabled physicians to improve dramatically the management of symptoms in multiple sclerosis without significantly altering the progressive long-term course of the disease.\r"

State Insurance Fund records demonstrate that 81 grease-burn injuries were reported from 1982 through 1985, at an average burn care cost of $660 per patient. Causes of burn wounds included adding, filtering, or removing hot grease, dropping objects into hot grease, slipping on the floor, cleaning the grill or fryer, and splashing hot grease during cooking. Those treated as outpatients were off from work for as long as 10 days. These data identify an adolescent population at risk for work-related burn injury in fast-food restaurants.\r"

Immunohistochemical-positive reactions to neurofilament, cytokeratin, neuron-specific enolase, and epithelial membrane antigen were noted. Electron microscopically, membrane-bound, dense core granules that yielded a positive uranaffin reaction and intermediate filaments in the perinuclear area were observed in the cytoplasm of most tumor cells. Desmosome-like structure between them was also found. Approximately 6 months after local excision, metastatic lesions developed in the regional lymph nodes and liver.\r"

In addition, the IgA-class pemphigus antibodies in this patient were blocked by the IgG-class pemphigus antibodies in tests on guinea pig and monkey esophagus. This indicates that the IgA-class antibodies in this patient were directed either to the same antigen as the IgG-class pemphigus foliaceus antibodies or to one that is close enough to it to give steric hindrance. The skin lesions responded poorly to systemic corticosteroid therapy. Dapsone therapy initially produced dramatic improvement, but the condition flared to the point that plasmapheresis, in addition to high doses of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, had to be used to control it.\r"

Clonal marrow assays in agar demonstrated normal to increased colony-forming units of granulocytes/macrophages. In long-term liquid cultures containing mast cell growth factor (interleukin 3), his marrow cells proliferated after 3 weeks to produce abnormal myeloid precursors similar to those in the corresponding marrow aspirate specimen. Cells with basophilic-staining granules were less abundant in comparison with normal marrow specimens cultured similarly. These results suggest that the mast cells in this patient are not of the same clone as the preleukemic marrow cells, although the possible marrow-cell origin of urticaria pigmentosa mast cells cannot be excluded. Previous reports suggest that urticaria pigmentosa without systemic mastocytosis occurs as a nonspecific abnormality in a variety of myeloid, lymphoid, and nonhematologic malignancies. Our data also support this hypothesis that urticaria pigmentosa is a reactive process rather than a manifestation of clonal proliferation of the primary malignancy.\r"

Recent studies with fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose suggest inhomogeneity of myocardial glucose metabolism in the normal human heart, which may relate to substrate availability. Therefore, quantitative evaluation of myocardial oxidative metabolism and glucose metabolism, as derived by dynamic positron emission tomography with carbon-11 (C-11) acetate and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, was performed in nine healthy male volunteers. All were studied under tightly controlled metabolic conditions of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping with and without a concurrent lipid emulsion infusion. Significant inhomogeneity of regional glucose metabolism was noted although it was less than that described under fasting conditions. Glucose utilization was 13% lower in the septum compared with the lateral wall both without and with lipid infusion (0.34 vs. 0.39 mumol/g per min, respectively, p less than 0.05; and 0.33 vs. 0.38 mumol/g per min, respectively, (p less than 0.05). Relatively decreased septal glucose utilization could not be explained by decreased metabolic demand because C-11 clearance constants were marginally higher in the septum than in the lateral wall in both studies (0.055 vs. 0.054 per min, respectively, p = NS; and 0.061 vs. 0.056 per min, respectively, p less than 0.05). Relatively decreased septal glucose utilization could reflect regional variation in substrate use and possible preferential free fatty acid utilization by the septum. These data provide a useful framework for assessing altered cardiac metabolism in disease and support standardization of metabolic conditions during metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography.\r"

  ".W": "Although serial left ventricular ejection fraction and volumetric measurements using gated radionuclide angiography are commonly used to evaluate clinical changes and therapeutic outcomes in individual patients, criteria are not available for accurately interpreting whether a change in any of these hemodynamic measurements is clinically meaningful. Accordingly, the magnitude of inherent variability among sequential measurements of hemodynamic variables assessed by gated radionuclide angiography was investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion in 39 patients during two placebo periods separated by 6 weeks. All patients analyzed had remained clinically stable during the study period. Although the mean values for all hemodynamic variables between the two placebo periods were minimally changed, the differences in individual patients were striking. Criteria were developed to allow meaningful interpretation of changes in hemodynamic variables by estimating the likelihood that an observed change is due to variability alone. On the basis of this analysis of placebo radionuclide angiographic data, variation due to chance alone is unlikely to account for all variability if a change observed between the two rest gated studies in a patient is greater than or equal to 7% units for left ventricular ejection fraction, greater than or equal to 45 ml/m2 for end-diastolic volume index, greater than or equal to 35 ml/m2 for end-systolic volume index, greater than or equal to 20 ml/m2 for stroke volume index and greater than or equal to 1.25 liters/min per m2 for cardiac index. An observed 4% unit change in left ventricular ejection fraction (increase or decrease) after a medical intervention in an individual patient occurs by random variation greater than 25% of the time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have established abnormalities in systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A consistent feature of this disease is reduced diastolic function of the left ventricle, but little information is available regarding right ventricular function in this disease. Cine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been found to be effective for measuring right ventricular volumes and therefore was used to assess early diastolic filling of the right ventricle in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular time-volume curves were obtained from cine NMR images in 10 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 8 normal subjects. Right ventricular volume was calculated with use of Simpson's algorithm at approximately 18 phases of the cardiac cycle and, from the curve, peak filling rate and filling fraction during the first third of diastole were determined. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak filling rate tended to be less (176 +/- 46 vs. 305 +/- 50 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and filling fraction decreased (39.5 +/- 13.8 vs. 74.5 +/- 13.3%, p less than 0.01) in comparison with values in normal subjects. Thus, analysis of right ventricular time-volume curves obtained by using cine NMR imaging demonstrated diastolic dysfunction of the right ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial repolarization waves are opposite in direction to P waves, may have a magnitude of 100 to 200 mu V and may extend into the ST segment and T wave. It was postulated that exaggerated atrial repolarization waves during exercise could produce ST segment depression mimicking myocardial ischemia. The P waves, PR segments and ST segments were studied in leads II, III, aVF and V4 to V6 in 69 patients whose exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) suggested ischemia (100 mu V horizontal or 150 mu V upsloping ST depression 80 ms after the J point). All had a normal ECG at rest. The exercise test in 25 patients (52% male, mean age 53 years) was deemed false positive because of normal coronary arteriograms and left ventricular function (5 patients) or normal stress single photon emission computed tomographic thallium or gated blood pool scans (16 patients), or both (4 patients). Forty-four patients with a similar age and gender distribution, anginal chest pain and at least one coronary stenosis greater than or equal to 80% served as a true positive control group. The false positive group was characterized by 1) markedly downsloping PR segments at peak exercise, 2) longer exercise time and more rapid peak exercise heart rate than those of the true positive group, and 3) absence of exercise-induced chest pain. The false positive group also displayed significantly greater absolute P wave amplitudes at peak exercise and greater augmentation of P wave amplitude by exercise in all six ECG leads than were observed in the true positive group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a patient group at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the spontaneous variability of ventricular arrhythmias was assessed, with simultaneous consideration of single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The study included 100 patients who suffered from coronary heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for whom greater than 30 ventricular premature complexes/h and couplets had been demonstrated on the last Holter ECG before the study. Between 3 and 12 Holter recordings were made for each patient in a drug-free state; the mean follow-up period was 260 days (maximum 1,403). The mean hourly values of the ectopic events (EE) were assessed separately for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The spontaneous variability (SV) was calculated for single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos as SV = log (EEday 2 + 0.01/EEday 1 + 0.01) and linked in one, two and three dimensions. Compared with the consideration of only one type of arrhythmia (one-dimensional model), the simultaneous use of two or three types of arrhythmia (two- or three-dimensional model) resulted in considerably lower reduction and aggravation rates as sufficient proof of drug effects. With control intervals up to 1 week, the one-dimensional model yielded reduction rates for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos of -63%, -90% and -95%, respectively. In contrast, with the three-dimensional model, the rates were -28%, -72% and -88%. The corresponding aggravation values were +370, +1,114% and +2,189% versus +38%, +256% and +747%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if a device that provides both antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy can safely reduce the frequency of shocks after implantation, 46 consecutive patients undergoing initial implantation of a defibrillator were studied. In all patients, the implanted device provided antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy. Detected tachycardia characteristics and the results of therapy were stored in the device's memory. There were 42 men and 4 women, aged 26 to 71 years (mean 58.7 +/- 13.5). Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 13% to 67% (mean 32.2 +/- 13.4%) and 31 patients had experienced one or more episodes of cardiac arrest. Induced arrhythmias included sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 38 patients, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 and ventricular fibrillation in 4. Over a total follow-up period of 255 patient-months (range 1 to 13, mean 6.1), 25 patients experienced spontaneous arrhythmic events. In 22 patients, 909 episodes of tachycardia were treated by antitachycardia pacing, which was successful on 840 occasions (92.4%). Acceleration of ventricular tachycardia by pacing therapy was estimated to have occurred 39 times. Syncope occurred once during pacing-induced acceleration of ventricular tachycardia. Forty-four episodes of tachycardia in seven patients were treated directly by shocks because of short tachycardia cycle length; 88% of all detected tachycardias were treated without the need for shocks. Four patients died from cardiorespiratory failure and one patient died suddenly without any detected tachyarrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to determine the prognostic significance of arrhythmias and other findings with respect to mortality. The mean age at diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy was 4.96 +/- 5.3 years. The overall mortality rate was 16% over a 10 year follow-up period. Persistent congestive heart failure and ST-T wave changes correlated with increased mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variables affected outcome. Arrhythmias were found in 46% of the patients; of the arrhythmias, 48% were atrial arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was present in six patients. Death occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients with known arrhythmia; 1 of the 5 died suddenly. The remaining 6 deaths in the series occurred in the 34 patients without a documented arrhythmia. It is concluded that 1) arrhythmias are frequently seen in children with dilated cardiomyopathy but are not predictive of outcome; 2) sudden death in children with this disease is rare; and 3) persistent congestive heart failure portends a poor prognosis.\r"

In three patients, the valve could not be crossed and an aortopulmonary shunt was performed. In 35 patients, follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 30 months (average 12) after valvuloplasty. In 24 of these 35 patients (group A), the stenosis had been adequately palliated by valvuloplasty; the other 11 patients (group B) had required an aortopulmonary shunt 1 month (range 0 to 3 months) after valvuloplasty. The two groups were similar (p greater than 0.1) with respect to age at valvuloplasty, pulmonary anulus diameter, ratio of pulmonary artery to descending aorta diameter before valvuloplasty and interval to follow-up angiography. In contrast to patients in group B, patients in group A had a significant immediate improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in pulmonary anulus diameter at follow-up angiography (p less than 0.001). The growth of the branch pulmonary arteries was similar (p greater than 0.1) in the two groups. Among 42 patients who have had surgical correction, a transannular patch for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was used in 27 (64%); there was no difference between groups A and B with respect to its use. Eight patients died (three after repair) and death could not be directly attributed to valvuloplasty in any. Balloon valvuloplasty promotes growth of the pulmonary valve anulus and pulmonary arteries and is a useful alternative to an aortopulmonary shunt in patients with small pulmonary arteries or associated complex intracardiac defects.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with double-outlet right ventricle, aged 1 week to 29 years (median 5 months), were studied with a 1.5 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging scanner. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients. Thirteen patients underwent angiography, including nine who underwent subsequent surgical correction. Three patients underwent postmortem examination. Small children and infants were scanned inside a 32 cm diameter proton head coil. Multiple 5 mm thick sections separated by 0.5 mm and gated to the patient's electrocardiogram were acquired with a spin-echo sequence and an echo time of 30 ms. A combination of standard and oblique imaging planes was used. Imaging times were less than 90 min. The NMR images were technically unsuitable in one patient because of excessive motion artifact. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis of double outlet right ventricle was confirmed and correlated with surgical and postmortem findings. The NMR images were particularly valuable in demonstrating the interrelations between the great arteries and the anatomy of the outlet septum and the spatial relations between the ventricular septal defect and the great arteries. Although the atrioventricular (AV) valves were not consistently demonstrated, NMR imaging in two patients identified abnormalities of the mitral valve that were not seen with two-dimensional echocardiography. In one patient who had a superoinferior arrangement of the ventricles, NMR imaging was the most useful imaging technique for demonstrating the anatomy. In patients with double-outlet right ventricle, NMR imaging can provide clinically relevant and accurate morphologic information that may contribute to future improvement in patient management.\r"

The three patients were a 6 month old girl (Case 1), a 5 month old boy (Case 2) and a 22 year old woman (Case 3). The latter had a pacemaker inserted after surgical ablation of the AV node. The heart was hypertrophied and enlarged in all. In Case 1, the AV node was partly within the central fibrous body and there was a left-sided AV bundle with acute necrosis in the summit of the ventricular septum, adjacent to the AV node and bundle. In Case 2, the coronary sinus was displaced cranially close to the central fibrous body, resulting in abnormality of the latter, with entrapment, distortion and division of the AV node and bundle into two distinct components within the central fibrous body. In Case 3, a left-sided AV node was connected to the atrial septum. The right AV node was completely interrupted by sutures and the penetrating and branching bundle and bundle branches were markedly fibrosed. In addition, the atrial septum and summit of the ventricular septum showed marked inflammatory reaction with fibrosis, which was more marked on the right ventricular side. Histologic examination of the conduction system in all three cases demonstrated congenital abnormalities of the AV junction that may be related to the tachycardia. These findings emphasize the need to carefully evaluate the atrial septum and AV junctional area, including the coronary sinus, before ablative procedures are undertaken.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three patients were symptomatic. The left to right shunt ranged from 1.6 to 2.6:1. In six patients, the fistula was an isolated congenital anomaly; in one, it was acquired. The fistula arose from branches of the left (n = 5) and right (n = 2) coronary arteries and drained to the right ventricle (n = 2), right atrium (n = 2), coronary sinus (n = 1), pulmonary artery (n = 1) and a bronchial artery (n = 1). Different embolization techniques were used to occlude eight feeding arteries. The embolization materials included a detachable balloon (n = 3), coaxial embolization with platinum microcoils (n = 3), a combination of detachable balloon and microcoil (n = 1) and standard steel coils (n = 1). Satisfactory occlusion was achieved in six patients. In one case, the valve of the detachable balloon was damaged, resulting in early balloon deflation and a residual fistula. There were no associated complications in any patient. Follow-up investigation by Doppler ultrasound or coronary angiography 4 months to 4 years later showed that permanent occlusion was achieved in all six patients in whom embolization was initially successful. Transcatheter embolization should be considered the treatment of choice for coronary artery fistulas.\r"

Laser balloon angioplasty, was performed in 21 patients (aged 56 +/- 13 years), including 10 patients treated urgently after acute failure of conventional angioplasty and 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty. Immediately after conventional angioplasty, laser doses (1 to 10 doses of 205 to 380 J each) were delivered during inflation of the laser balloon to a pressure of 4 atm. Seven (70%) of 10 patients with acute failure of conventional angioplasty were successfully treated with laser balloon angioplasty, but 3 (30%) were unsuccessfully treated with the laser procedure and required emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. In all three failures, the 3 mm laser balloon angioplasty catheter was not the optimal size for the vessel. In the 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty (reference diameter 2.94 +/- 0.22 mm), the minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.45 +/- 0.25 to 1.85 +/- 0.46 mm after conventional angioplasty and to 2.44 +/- 0.29 mm after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). This corresponded to a decrease in diameter stenosis from 84 +/- 9% before to 35 +/- 16% after conventional angioplasty and to 15 +/- 10% after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery or death and no acute complications related to delivery of laser energy in this group. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed 5.5 +/- 1.1 months after laser balloon angioplasty in 18 patients discharged from the hospital after a successful procedure. Ten patients (56%) had angiographic restenosis, defined as recurrent diameter stenosis greater than 50%. Six patients were subsequently treated by directional coronary atherectomy, which revealed intimal proliferation indistinguishable from that in patients with restenosis after conventional angioplasty. In conclusion, laser balloon angioplasty may be effective in sealing severe coronary dissections and reversing abrupt closure associated with failed conventional angioplasty. After uncomplicated conventional angioplasty, laser balloon angioplasty improves immediate luminal dimensions, but restenosis appears to be mediated by intimal hyperplasia, similar to that seen after conventional angioplasty.\r"

Clinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcome after peripheral vascular surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patient-related factors and the nature of the peripheral vascular operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the peripheral vascular procedure. However, peripheral vascular surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential. All patients with peripheral vascular disease should be considered to be at lifelong risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and should undergo appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation and be treated accordingly.\r"

Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary oxygenated perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 +/- 2%, 6 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 1%, in control and unoxygenated and oxygenated perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus oxygenated perfluorochemical p less than 0.004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with oxygenated perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0.97 +/- 0.22 vs. control 0.39 +/- 0.08 ml/min per g; p less than 0.04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both oxygenated (5.9 +/- 1.4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5.4 +/- 0.8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18.9 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of superoxide dismutase treatment on infarct size, postischemic recovery of contractile function and tissue content of high energy phosphates were examined in a canine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Ischemia was induced by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery and reperfusion was achieved by intravenous thrombolysis. Average duration of ischemia was 90 min. Fifty closed chest anesthetized dogs were randomized to receive either superoxide dismutase (34,000 IU/min intravenously) or placebo, starting approximately 30 min before and continuing for 30 min into the reperfusion phase. Left ventricular ejection fraction and regional segmental shortening of the postischemic area were calculated from contrast angiograms after 4 h, 48 h and 1 week of reperfusion. Tissue content of high energy phosphates was determined from transmural biopsy after 4 h and 1 week. Infarct size was measured by planimetry of dye-stained heart slices. In the superoxide dismutase and placebo-treated groups, respectively, the mortality rate was 25% and 16%, collateral flow 20 +/- 10 and 23 +/- 18 ml/min per 100 g, area at risk 25 +/- 6% and 26 +/- 7% of the left ventricle and infarct size 28 +/- 19% and 36 +/- 27% of the area at risk. Multiple regression analysis failed to show any beneficial effect of superoxide dismutase treatment on infarct size. Left ventricular ejection fraction, regional segmental shortening of the postischemic area and tissue content of high energy phosphates recovered to a similar extent and at a similar rate in both treated and placebo groups up to 1 week after reperfusion. Thus, in this model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion superoxide dismutase treatment is of no benefit.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether a quantitative relation exists between pericardial pressure and respiratory variation in intracardiac blood flow velocities, a spontaneously breathing closed chest canine model of pericardial tamponade was created. In seven dogs, pericardial pressure was sequentially increased in stages from a mean of -4 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg while aortic and pulmonary Doppler flow velocities, pleural pressure changes (respiratory effort), blood pressure and cardiac output were measured. The variation in the Doppler-detected peak transaortic velocity (AV) during inspiration (IV) increased linearly from -5 +/- 3% at baseline (pericardial pressure -4 mm Hg) to -32 +/- 9% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg [IVAV = -2 (pericardial pressure)--13.1; r = 0.78, p less than 10(-6)]. The inspiratory variation in the peak transpulmonary velocity increased from 13 +/- 3% at baseline to 71 +/- 19% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg. The inspiratory variation in the pulmonary Doppler peak velocity (IVPV) was dependent on both pericardial pressure and degree of respiratory effort [IVPV = 3.8 (pericardial pressure) + 2.6 (respiratory effort) + 10.9; r = 0.88, p less than 10(-8)]. Thus, quantitative relations exist between increases in intrapericardial pressure and increases in inspiratory variation of peak aortic and pulmonary flow velocities. Additionally, pulmonary artery flow velocity is influenced more than aortic velocity by intrathoracic pressure.\r"

  ".U": "91268406\r", 
  ".W": "A hallmark of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus. However, the exact mechanism of pulsus paradoxus and the relation of left and right ventricular ejection dynamics remain controversial, with some studies suggesting an inverse relation in ventricular filling and ejection and others citing a more important role for the effects of right heart ejection dynamics delayed by transit through the pulmonary artery bed. To specifically reexamine this issue, six sedated but spontaneously breathing dogs were studied during experimental cardiac tamponade with use of extensive hemodynamic instrumentation and Doppler methods. During cardiac tamponade, left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 125.8 +/- 12.1 to 81.7 +/- 26.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and cardiac output from 5.86 +/- 1.48 to 2.34 +/- 0.98 liters/min (p less than 0.001); mean pericardial pressure increased from -1.2 +/- 0.8 to 10.5 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and pulsus paradoxus from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 10.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) compared with baseline values. An inverse relation in left and right ventricular ejection dynamics that was very close to 180 degrees out of phase was seen throughout the respiratory cycle in multiple hemodynamic and Doppler variables including peak systolic pressures, aortic and pulmonary flow velocities and ventricular ejection times. Simultaneous recording of the transmitral pressure gradient provided indirect evidence that the ventricular ejection dynamics were directly related to changes in ventricular filling. However, the magnitude of ventricular pressure or output flow velocity for each respiratory cycle was variable, depending on the exact timing of filling and ejection in relation to the phase of respiration. Variation in left ventricular output due to changes in right ventricular output delayed by transit through the pulmonary vasculature was not recognized in any animal. It is concluded that in spontaneously breathing dogs with acute cardiac tamponade, peak ventricular pressures, ventricular ejection times and pulmonary and aortic flow velocities have an inverse relation that is very close to 180 degrees out of phase.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography was used to image blood flow and metabolic tracers in risk zone myocardium after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion during synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion. Six control and seven intervention open chest dogs had occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Synchronized retroperfusion commenced 25 min later. Flow tracers (rubidium-82 and nitrogen-13 ammonia) were injected retrogradely. Three hours after coronary occlusion, fluorine-18 (F-18) deoxyglucose uptake in the control and treatment groups was compared. At 200 min of occlusion, infarct size was assessed. Retrograde flow tracer uptake was observed in the risk zone in the seven intervention dogs. Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose uptake in the risk zone was increased in five of the six intervention dogs but was reduced in five of the six control dogs. The risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was higher in the intervention than the control group (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.51; p less than 0.05). The endocardial subsegment risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was also significantly higher in the intervention group. Percent infarction in the risk zone was 70% lower in the group treated with synchronized retroperfusion than in the control group (18.4 +/- 22.6% vs. 61.2 +/- 25.4%; p less than 0.02). Thus, positron emission tomography revealed that retroperfusion could deliver oxygenated blood and maintain metabolism in risk zone myocardium. Infarct size was limited to 30% of that of control. In acute closure of the left anterior descending coronary artery, synchronized retroperfusion might be considered for maintaining viability of the jeopardized myocardium if the artery cannot be reopened rapidly.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the safety and efficacy of synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion during brief periods of ischemia, 30 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied. Each patient underwent a minimum of two angioplasty balloon inflations. Alternate dilations were supported with retroperfusion; the unsupported inflations served as the control inflations. Synchronized retroperfusion was performed by pumping autologous femoral artery blood by means of an electrocardiogram-triggered retroperfusion pump into the great cardiac vein through a triple lumen 8.5F balloon-tipped retroperfusion catheter inserted percutaneously from the right internal jugular vein. Clinical symptoms, hemodynamics and two-dimensional echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities were analyzed. Retroperfusion was associated with a lower angina severity score (0.8 +/- 1 vs. 1.2 +/- 1) and delay in onset of angina (53 +/- 31 vs. 37 +/- 14 s; p less than 0.05) compared with the control inflations. The magnitude of ST segment change was 0.11 +/- 0.14 mV with retroperfusion and 0.16 +/- 0.17 mV without treatment (p less than 0.05). The severity of left ventricular wall motion abnormality was also significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced with retroperfusion compared with control (0.7 +/- 1.4 [hypokinesia] vs. -0.3 +/- 1.6 [dyskinesia]). There were no significant changes in hemodynamics, except in mean coronary venous pressure, which increased from 8 +/- 3 mm Hg at baseline to 13 +/- 6 mm Hg with retroperfusion. Four patients required prolonged retroperfusion for treatment of angioplasty-induced complications. The mean retroperfusion duration in these patients was 4 +/- 2 h (range 2 to 7). In the three patients who underwent emergency bypass surgery, the coronary sinus was directly visualized during surgery and found to be without significant injury. There were no major complications. Minor adverse effects were transient atrial fibrillation (n = 2), jugular venous catheter insertion site hematomas (n = 4) and atrial wall staining (n = 1), all of which subsided spontaneously. Thus, retroperfusion significantly reduced and delayed the onset of coronary angioplasty-induced myocardial ischemia and provided effective supportive therapy for failed and complicated angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion was used during coronary balloon angioplasty to support the ischemic myocardium of 20 patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event. Hemodynamics and left ventricular function were the major end points of the study. Coronary venous catheterization and retroperfusion were successfully performed in 15 patients. The target vessel was an unprotected left main artery in 2, left anterior descending artery in 10, left circumflex coronary artery in 1 and right coronary artery in 2 patients. A nonsupported balloon inflation (mean 44 +/- 13 s) was compared with a later retroperfusion-supported inflation (mean 145 +/- 21 s). Right anterior oblique left ventriculograms, aortic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and thermodilution cardiac output were obtained before and during peak untreated and treated balloon inflations and on completion of angioplasty. All patients had either a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40 or greater than 40% of contracting myocardium estimated to be at risk for severe ischemia during angioplasty. The cardiac (liters/min per m2) and stroke work (g.m/m2) indexes decreased from mean baseline values of 2.5 +/- 0.52 and 52 +/- 15 to 1.7 +/- 0.47 and 27 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD), respectively, during nonsupported balloon inflations but decreased only to 2.1 +/- 0.52 (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported) and to 36 +/- 14 (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported), respectively, during retroperfusion-supported inflations. Ejection fraction (n = 8) decreased from a baseline value of 55 +/- 13% to 27 +/- 7.3% during nonsupported inflations but only to 39 +/- 10% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported). Regional wall motion (area change) in the ischemic (target) region was reduced from a baseline value of 49 +/- 17% to 11 +/- 16% during nonsupported inflations but only to 27 +/- 15% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported). All but two patients had a favorable hemodynamic response to retroperfusion. There were no serious adverse effects related to the procedures and no hospital deaths. It is concluded from this preliminary study that coronary venous retroperfusion appears to be safe, to provide hemodynamic support and to improve left ventricular function during angioplasty in patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event.\r"

Regional myocardial temperatures were measured by using needle-tipped thermistors stabbed in the 1) anterior wall distal to the occlusion site, 2) anterior wall proximal to the occlusion site, 3) left lateral wall, 4) posterior wall, and 5) right ventricular free wall. Rectal and pulmonary artery temperatures were also measured. In the hypothermic retroperfusion group, the anterior wall temperature decreased rapidly by 5 degrees C at 15 min of retroperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. normothermic retroperfusion or untreated control groups), whereas the temperature at other sites decreased with a linear trend over time. Myocardial temperatures in the ischemic area (distal anterior wall) were generally lower than those in the other sites during the first 60 min of hypothermic retroperfusion and the largest intramyocardial temperature difference (3.6 degrees C) was found at 15 min after retroperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the risk area was significantly smaller in the hypothermic retroperfusion group (6.2 +/- 3.3%) than in the control (64.9 +/- 14%) or normothermic retroperfusion groups (24.1 +/- 6.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-two normal subjects and seven patients with stable angina served as the control subjects. Endothelin-1 levels in patients with stable coronary disease were not different from those of normal subjects (0.62 +/- 0.56 and 0.76 +/- 0.38 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, plasma levels of endothelin-1 rose sharply after myocardial infarction, reaching a peak of 4.95 +/- 0.78 pg/ml at 6 h after the onset of chest pain (p less than 0.05 compared with values in control subjects) and returning rapidly toward the normal range by 24 h. Patients with complicated infarction (group II) demonstrated a similar rapid increase in plasma endothelin-1 to a peak value of 8.29 +/- 1.95 pg/ml; however, plasma endothelin-1 remained elevated in these patients, becoming significantly different from values in group I at 48 and 72 h. There was no correlation between peak increases in creatine kinase and peak endothelin-1 in either group, suggesting that the stimulus for elevation of endothelin-1 was not myocardial necrosis itself. Furthermore, left ventricular ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in endothelin-1 in group I patients, whereas there was a significant inverse relation between ventricular function and plasma endothelin-1 in group II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Separate analysis of each marker revealed the following respective values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value regarding prediction of coronary artery patency: CK peak less than or equal to 12 h: 84%, 95%, 98% and 64%; reduction of the ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 50%: 60%, 95%, 97% and 42%; and reperfusion arrhythmias: 63%, 89%, 95% and 43%. The combined analysis of all three markers utilizing a logistic regression procedure showed that CK peak (p = 0.0001) and resolution of the ST segment elevation (p = 0.005), but not the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias (p = 0.26), were independent predictors of vessel patency. From this logistic regression procedure, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 100% for prediction of coronary artery patency were obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The following formulas were used: 1) Aortic distensibility = 2(Changes in aortic diameter)/(Diastolic aortic diameter) (Pulse pressure); and 2) Aortic stiffness index = ln(Systolic blood pressure)/(Diastolic blood pressure)(Changes in aortic diameter)/Diastolic aortic diameter. Pulse wave velocity was also measured. Compared with normal subjects, patients with the Marfan syndrome had decreased aortic distensibility in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (2.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.4 cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001 and 4.5 +/- 2.1, vs. 7.7 +/- 2.5, cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001, respectively) and had an increased aortic stiffness index in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (10.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 5.9 +/- 2.2, p less than 0.005 and 7.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.005, respectively). Aortic diameters in the ascending aorta were larger in these patients than in normal subjects, but those in the abdominal aorta were similar in the two groups. Linear correlations for both aortic distensibility and stiffness index were found between the ascending and the abdominal aorta (r = 0.85 and 0.71, respectively). Pulse wave velocity was more rapid in the patients than in the normal subjects (11.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 1.4 m/s, respectively, p less than 0.01). Thus, aortic elastic properties are abnormal in patients with the Marfan syndrome irrespective of the aortic diameter, which suggests an intrinsic abnormality of the aortic arterial wall.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen normal subjects and five patients with atrial fibrillation underwent transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiographic studies to evaluate the normal pulmonary venous flow pattern, compare right and left pulmonary venous flow and assess the effect of sample volume location on pulmonary venous flow velocities. Best quality tracings were obtained by transesophageal echocardiography. Anterograde flow during systole and diastole was observed in all patients by both techniques. Reversed flow during atrial contraction was observed with transesophageal echocardiography in 18 of the 19 subjects in normal sinus rhythm, but in only 7 subjects with transthoracic echocardiography. Two forward peaks during ventricular systole were clearly identified in 14 subjects (73%) with transesophageal echocardiography, but in none with the transthoracic technique. The early systolic wave immediately followed the reversed flow during atrial contraction and was strongly related to the timing of atrial contraction (r = 0.78; p less than 0.001), but not to the timing of ventricular contraction, and appeared to be secondary to atrial relaxation. Conversely, the late systolic wave was temporally related to ventricular ejection (r = 0.66; p less than 0.001), peaking 100 ms before the end of the aortic valve closure and was unrelated to atrial contraction time. Quantitatively, significantly higher peak systolic flow velocities were obtained in the left upper pulmonary vein compared with the right upper pulmonary vein (60 +/- 17 vs. 52 +/- 15 cm/s; p less than 0.05) and by transesophageal echocardiography compared with transthoracic studies (60 +/- 17 vs. 50 +/- 14 cm/s; p less than 0.05). Increasing depth of interrogation beyond 1 cm from the vein orifice resulted in a significant decrease in the number of interpretable tracings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the effects of exercise-induced ischemia on Doppler-derived filling variables, 20 patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced electrocardiographic changes and regional wall motion abnormalities determined by two-dimensional echocardiography were evaluated and compared with 20 patients without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Doppler echocardiography was performed at rest and immediately after exercise before the resolution of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities. Peak E and A velocities increased from rest to postexercise in both the ischemic and nonischemic groups, although the ischemic group demonstrated a greater increase in peak E velocity (from 68 +/- 15 cm/s at rest to 88 +/- 22 cm/s after exercise) than the nonischemic group (70 +/- 13 to 77 +/- 18 cm/s) (p less than 0.05 for the difference in response between groups). Accompanying these changes was a slight increase in the peak E/A velocity ratio in the ischemic group (1.04 +/- 0.28 at rest to 1.13 +/- 0.42 after exercise) versus a decrease in the nonischemic group (1.07 +/- 0.30 to 0.90 +/- 0.28) (p less than 0.05 intergroup difference).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doppler color flow assessments were performed in both an in vitro model and in 30 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the experimental Doppler study using a circuit model, color jet width correlated well with actual orifice diameter (r = 0.99). In the clinical Doppler study, the mitral valve orifice was assumed to be elliptic and the mitral valve area was calculated from the following equation: (pi/4) (a x b), where a = color jet width at the mitral valve orifice in the apical long-axis view (short diameter) and b = the width in the 90 degrees rotated view (long diameter). Mitral valve area was also determined by two-dimensional echocardiography and the pressure half-time method, and the results for all three noninvasive methods were compared with those obtained at cardiac catheterization. By Doppler color flow imaging, mitral valve area could be determined in all patients and there was a significant correlation between the Doppler jet and catheterization estimates of mitral valve area (r = 0.93). Valve area determined by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated well with catheterization measurements in 26 patients (r = 0.84). However, the area could not be determined in 4 (13%) of the 30 patients because of technical problems. Although there was a fair correlation between the valve area determined by the pressure half-time method and catheterization (r = 0.79), this method tended to overestimate valve area in patients with aortic regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The evidence of myocardium at potential ischemic risk on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy was compared with that of manifest ischemia on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in 26 patients at high risk of a coronary event undergoing noncardiac surgery. The clinical outcome was also assessed. Induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were more common in patients and myocardial segments with, than in those without, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect (both p less than 0.05). Conversely, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect was more common in patients and segments with, than in those without, a new intraoperative wall motion abnormality (both p less than 0.05). Six patients, five with a reversible scintigraphic defect but only three with a new wall motion abnormality, had a hard perioperative ischemic event. Events occurred more often among patients with, than in those without, a reversible perioperative scintigraphic defect (5 [33%] of 15 vs. 1 [9%] of 11) but this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.14), probably owing to the sample size. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were all reversible and did not differentiate between risk groups; these findings were possibly influenced by treatment. These preliminary data support the known relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and perioperative events and identify another manifestation of ischemic risk in the relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities. The value of intraoperative echocardiography in identifying ischemia and guiding therapy in patients with a reversible scintigraphic abnormality should be further assessed.\r"

Multifilament and monofilament nylon sutures were selected for this evaluation because they are commonly used in wound closure. The mechanical performance of these sutures was judged by the following parameters: knot breakage force, configuration of secure knots, and knot run down force. During each test, tension was applied at either rapid or slow rates, which correlates with the physician's speed of tying knots. On the basis of these mechanical performance tests, four throw square (1 = 1 = 1 =1) knots and five throw square (1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1) knots are recommended for monofilament nylon and multifilament nylon sutures, respectively, in which the speed of application of forces to the knots is relatively slow. Because these tests can easily be replicated in any laboratory, manufacturers now have a scientific basis for recommending specific tying techniques for their surgical sutures.\r"

Interventional dialysis (ID), defined as emergent dialysis required to treat the patient's presenting complaint, was required for 30 patients, with the most common presenting complaints of these patients being shortness of breath, weakness, and chest pain. Only SOB was statistically significant in predicting the need for ID (P less than 0.001), with a positive predictive value of 0.63 and a negative predictive value of 0.85.

  ".W": "To facilitate documentation and assess the number and types of clinical procedures actually performed by resident physicians, we developed a microcomputer-based recording process. After completing a procedure, including resuscitations, residents recorded in a precoded book issued for each monthly rotation. At the end of each rotation, the books were collected and the information was transferred to a database program by the clerical staff. During 1989, 17 emergency medicine resident physicians at PGY levels 1 through 3 utilized this system. Completed procedure record books were submitted for 124 of 148 clinically active months for a compliance rate of 84%. Of 1,857 procedures recorded, the most frequent were resuscitation (20%), orotrachael intubation (12%), and percutaneous central vein cannulation (12%). Commonly recorded were lumbar puncture (7%), diagnostic peritoneal lavage (5%), nasotrachael intubation (4%), and newborn delivery (4%). The high compliance rate suggests resident physicians acceptance. This system enables residency directors to closely monitor individual and group procedure experiences and to make curriculum changes based on objective findings. It also provides a means of storing and retrieving data for review organizations and credentials committees.\r"

These objectives are designed to focus the resident's reading and study during a critical care rotation.\r"

Nevertheless, established zoonotic agents, newly discovered microorganisms, or new animal species not previously recognized as carriers of zoonotic microorganisms are encountered, and the potential for spread of infectious disease from animals to humans still exists. Active dialogue between veterinarians and physicians regarding the potential of zoonotic disease, the species of animals that are involved, and the methods of diagnosis, is an indispensable component of a successful preventive health program involving personnel who deal with laboratory animals.\r"

The use of biotinylated HTLV-I (biot-HTLV-I) in conjunction with mouse mAb specific for selected cell-surface molecules and flow cytometric analysis allowed us to positively identify virus-binding cells among a heterogeneous blood mononuclear cell population. Biot-HTLV-I efficiently bound not only to T cells, but also to B cells and monocytes. Preincubation of monocytes with excess of unlabeled HTLV-I significantly reduced the attachment of biot-HTLV-I. HTLV-I not only bound to, but also infected, B cells, as suggested by: i) in situ hybridization of a 35S-labeled full length HTLV-I DNA probe with EBV-transformed B cells, previously cocultured with HTLV-I-producing (G11MJ) T cells, and ii) hybridization of the same nick-translated 32P-labeled DNA probe with blotted DNA from similar HTLV-I-infected EBV-transformed B cells. HTLV-I infection did not affect the ability of B cells to secrete IgG. These findings suggest that HTLV-I cannot only infect cells of the T lineage, but can also infect B cells.\r"

To identify the factors that support it, IL-6, a cytokine with an important role in the differentiation of IgG-secreting cells, was studied in SLE patients. Higher than normal levels of IL-6 were found, by a B9 assay, in sera of 63 of 70 patients (p less than 0.05). IL-6 was detected in 36 of 37 active SLE sera in higher titers (p = 0.009) than those for inactive SLE (n = 33), which were higher (p less than 0.05) than healthy controls (n = 15). IL-6 mRNA was detected in freshly isolated PBMC of 11 of 11 patients but not in normal PBMC, whereas IL-1 mRNA was detected only in patients with active disease. IL-6 activity was recovered from PBMC of four SLE patients, but not from four normal donors. By immunoperoxidase, IL-6 was detected in the cytoplasm of SLE monocytes and lymphocytes. When SLE PBMC were grown in short term cultures with no deliberate stimulation, expression of the IL-6 gene declined rapidly. Accordingly, the spontaneous production of IgG by SLE PBMC could be enhanced by exogenous IL-6. Spontaneous IgG production was diminished by 20 to 65% in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-1. In contrast, neutralization of endogenous IL-4 increased production by approximately 40%. Anti-TNF-alpha treatment decreased IL-6 content of PBMC cultures, whereas anti-IL-4 augmented it, and exogenous IL-6 reversed anti-TNF-alpha effects on IgG production. Therefore, it is possible that the neutralization of TNF-alpha and IL-4 affected IgG production by modulating the synthesis/activity of IL-6. These results support the concept that SLE B cell hyperactivity is promoted by dysregulation of endogenous cytokines and suggest that IL-6, in particular, has an important pathogenic role.\r"

Immobilized rsELAM1 also binds human PMN, monocytes, NK cells, and T cells. T cell subset analyses indicate preferential binding of CD4+ T memory cells.

These studies also suggest that the EGF-like domain is important in maintaining the conformation of the neighbouring lectin domain. In functional studies, U937 cells bound to Cos cells expressing either ELAM-1 or ELAM-1 with the complement regulatory protein domains deleted. No adhesion was observed to Cos cells expressing ELAM-1 mutants lacking either the lectin or EGF-like domains. The fact that antibodies directed against the lectin domain can inhibit adhesion suggest that this domain is directly involved in cell binding.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we describe a 76-kDa glycoprotein recognized by mAb FMC46 that, by virtue of its concentration on cell protrusions involved in motility, may be important in lymphoid cell locomotion. FMC46 detects an epitope of the leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1), a member of the selecting family (LAM-1, Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecular-1 (ELAM-1), and Granule Membrane Protein-140 (GMP-140), that is expressed on LAM-1-transfected cell lines, is a glycosylation epitope based on its loss after culture in tunicamycin, and is closely related to the LAM-1.2 epitope. FMC46 is expressed at high density on the majority of CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ peripheral blood T cells (60 to 70%) and on a subset of thymocytes that includes the multinegative CD3- CD4- CD8- progenitor cells (100% FMC46hi) and the CD45R0- presumptive thymic generative lineage (70% FMC46hi). It appears at reduced density and frequency on CD45RA- thymocytes (50% FMC46lo), comprised mainly of death-committed thymocytes. Among thymic subsets defined by expression of CD4 and/or CD8, FMC46 is expressed at high density predominantly on a subset of single-positive cells and not on double-positive cells. These results suggest a fundamental role for LAM-1 in thymic development, with a high density preferentially expressed on cells involved in thymic generative processes and a low density on cells progressing to intrathymic death. A major subset of peripheral blood B cells and thymic B cells also express FMC46. Immunohistochemistry on frozen sections indicated strong staining in splenic follicles and around blood vessels, staining of the thymic medulla and subcapsular areas, and staining of the mantle zone of germinal centers of the lymph node. FMC46+ lymphocytes accumulated along high endothelial venules in the lymph node. On locomoting multinegative thymocytes, FMC46 is concentrated on the leading tip of extended processes, on pseudopods, and on ruffles, unlike the distribution of either CD44 or TQ1 (LAM 1.2), suggesting a role in locomotion. On dividing multinegative thymocytes, FMC46 was found almost exclusively along the cleavage furrow, implicating it in detachment processes. We conclude that the properties of the LAM-1 molecule recognized by FMC46 are consistent with a role in detachment phases of motility and of cell interactions.\r"

  ".U": "91268539\r", 
  ".W": "CD2 (T11, the T cell E receptor), a nonpolymorphic 47- to 55-kDa glycoprotein, is a T cell-specific surface protein that plays an important role in T lymphocyte adhesion, signal transduction, and differentiation. A natural ligand of CD2 is lymphocyte function associated Ag-3 (LFA-3 (CD58)), a widely expressed glycoprotein of 50 to 70 kDa. The physiologic interaction of CD2 with LFA-3 functions to increase intercellular adhesion and plays a role in T cell activation. This interaction, however, in the absence of other stimuli, has not previously been shown to induce intracellular signals such as Ca2+ mobilization or IL-2 production. To investigate whether cAMP may play a role in ligand-triggered CD2-mediated signal transduction, we have studied the ability of purified LFA-3 and anti-CD2 mAb to induce changes in intracellular cAMP content in murine Ag-specific T cell hybridomas that stably express wild-type and mutated human CD2 molecules. By using a RIA sensitive to the femtomolar range and specific for cAMP, we demonstrate that purified LFA-3, like anti-CD2 mAb, is capable of inducing marked, transient increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Presentation of purified LFA-3, like anti-CD2 mAb, is capable of inducing marked, transient increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Presentation of purified LFA-3 alone to CD2-expressing hybridoma cells, however, did not stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover nor IL-2 production. The cytoplasmic domain of CD2 is necessary for these ligand-induced cAMP changes, demonstrating that LFA-3 binding to CD2 transduces a signal to the cell. Experiments using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine showed that CD2-mediated regulation of cAMP levels occurs primarily by the stimulation of cAMP production rather than by the inhibition of cAMP degradation. These results demonstrate that the interaction of LFA-3 with CD2, in the absence of other stimuli, is capable of initiating intracellular biochemical changes and suggest that CD2/LFA-3 interactions may regulate T cell function at least in part through the generation of intracellular cAMP.\r"

Both protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters, e.g., PMA, and LPS induce IL-1 beta expression in these cells. Physiologic RA concentrations alone were not able to induce any IL-1 beta production, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta protein production and mRNA accumulation in both human monocytes and in THP-1 cells. Nuclear run-off analysis revealed that the enhancing effect was at the transcriptional level. RA also slightly potentiated LPS-induced IL-1 beta expression in THP-1 cells but not in human monocytes. These data suggest that RA can be a strong up-regulator of IL-1 production, but its strength varies depending on the nature of the activating signal.\r"

  ".W": "There are six known HLA-B alleles that share the HLA-B27 allospecificity, yet differ by one to six amino acid substitutions. Each of these B27 alleles can be readily assigned by one of the six representative IEF patterns. Two unrelated individuals, LH and HS, express B27 Ag that appear to be identical by IEF, but an HLA-B27 alloreactive CTL clone I-73 was found to react differently with these cells, suggesting these B27 molecules are not identical. We sequenced polymerase chain reaction-amplified B27 cDNA clones obtained from HS and compared its deduced amino acid sequence (B27-HS) with the B27 sequence of LH (B27-LH) which was previously designated the B*2701 allele. B27-HS and B27-LH differ by eight amino acids; three in alpha 1 domain and five in alpha 2 domain. These amino acid substitutions of B27-HS altered T cell recognition but not the B27 serologic epitope or IEF pattern. B27-HS differs from the six known B27 alleles by five to eight amino acid substitutions, and thus it represents the seventh allele of the HLA-B27 Ag family. This novel B27 allele might have been derived from a gene conversion event. Previously, two amino acid residues at positions 70 and 97 were suggested to be specific for B27 Ag family. B27-HS now reveals that Lys at position 70 is specific for B27 but Asn at position 97 is not. We propose that the region around position 70 might be crucial in determining the B27 serologic epitope and possibly in peptide Ag binding. This study also demonstrates that class I molecules of the same Ag specificity sharing an indistinguishable IEF pattern are not necessarily identical, and indicates that only the definitive determination of primary structure would identify all the class I alleles that are functionally relevant in regard to alloreactivity, T cell restriction, and disease association.\r"

Western blot analysis revealed that the major forms of IgA in human AmF contain secretory component (SC), but ranged in size between 170 and 200 kDa, unlike the 380-kDa size typical of previously described secretory (s)IgA. Preliminary characterization of these novel forms of sIgA suggests they may arise by reduction of selected disulfide bonds, rather than proteolytic cleavage, of 380-kDa sIgA. This study also shows that AmF contains SC in its free form. Free SC measured by ELISA in 30 AmF samples increased with gestational age of the fetus from 26 to 40 wk postconception. Late in gestation, the concentrations of free SC levels reached those of other external secretions. Both the fetal urogenital system and the amniotic membrane appear to contribute to both the free SC and sIgA in AmF. This report presents the initial description of a new form of sIgA and provides evidence that the AmF may be an early expression of the mucosal immune system in the developing fetus.\r"

In this study, sets of peptide analogues containing long chain-biotinylated lysine individually substituted for each amino acid in the sequence have been used to explore the structural requirements for the formation of peptide-MHC class II protein complexes. Based on the ability of the analogs to bind both the MHC protein and fluorescent streptavidin, receptor contact residues were identified and from their spacing the conformation of the bound peptides could be inferred. Six separate peptides were studied; three defined by HLA-DR1Dw1-restricted T cells, and three identified by T cells restricted through alleles other than HLA-DR1Dw1. The similar patterns of fluorescent signals observed when the former three peptides were studied indicated that they shared conformational features when bound to HLA-DR1Dw1. In contrast when the latter three peptides were examined, the data indicated that they shared some but not all of the conformational features characteristic of the peptides known to elicit HLA-DR1Dw1-restricted T cells. When the peptide sequences were aligned based on the critical contact residues, two positions of structural homology were apparent. In each sequence, an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain could be identified separated by four residues from a small amino acid. These minimal structural requirements were consistent with recent experiments demonstrating that only a small number of side chains in the peptide were necessary for binding to the MHC protein.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the interaction of the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) peptide 107-116 with the MHC class II molecule I-Ek, using truncated and single residue substitution analogues to measure activation of I-Ek-restricted, 107-116-specific T cell hybridomas and competition for Ag presentation by I-Ek molecules. These results have been compared with previous findings on the interaction of the same peptide with the I-Ed molecule. Stimulation of T cell hybridomas by truncated peptides defines the sequence 108-116 as the minimum epitope necessary for activation of both I-Ek- and I-Ed-restricted T cell hybridomas. Substitution analysis pinpoints three residues (V109, A110, and K116) in the sequence 108-116 as being critical for binding to I-Ek molecules and demonstrates the involvement of most other residues in recognition by T cells. Results previously obtained for binding of HEL 107-116 to I-Ed molecules indicated that peptide residues R112, R114, and K116 were critical for interaction with I-Ed. Comparison of these results indicates a difference in the likely MHC contact residues between the HEL sequence 108-116 and I-Ed or I-Ek molecules, suggesting that the same HEL peptide assumes a different conformation in the binding site of these two MHC molecules. This in turn affects residues interacting with the specific T cell receptor. According to the hypothetical tridimensional structure predicted for class II molecules, the difference in MHC contact residues observed within the sequence 108-116 can be related to polymorphic amino acids in the binding site of I-Ek and I-Ed molecules. A search through published binding data for a common pattern in this and other I-Ek-binding peptides has permitted us to derive a possible motif for predicting peptide binding to I-Ek molecules. This putative motif was tested by determining binding to I-Ek of an unbiased panel of about 150 synthetic peptides. Binding data indeed demonstrate the presence of this motif in the majority of good binders to I-Ek molecules.\r"

In the present study we have further characterized the cloned Poa p IX proteins, identified the corresponding proteins in KBG pollen extract, and determined their antigenic relationships with other known grass pollen allergens. A recombinant IgE-binding polypeptide rKBG7.2 that represents the C-terminal fragment, conserved in Poa p IX proteins, appeared to contain epitopes unique to these proteins and served as an immunosorbent for the isolation of the corresponding human IgE antibodies. On two-dimensional PAGE blots these IgE antibodies bound selectively to five distinct KBG pollen proteins with molecular mass 28 to 34 kDa and isoelectric point greater than 9.5. These proteins differ in size and charge from known allergens, but are very similar to those of the recombinant Poa p IX proteins. The rKBG3.1, which represents the N-terminal region of the Poa p IX clone KBG31, as well as the corresponding natural allergens were shown to possess epitopes that crossreact with the acidic group V allergens of Timothy. Comparison of amino acid sequences of recombinant Poa p IX proteins with those of Lol p I isoallergens revealed no significant sequence similarities. In contrast, partial homology was demonstrated between the N-terminal sequences of these proteins and the Phl p V proteins. Our results confirm that the Poa p IX clones represent a distinct and major group of allergens of KBG pollen, and demonstrate structural similarities and antigenic cross-reactivities among different groups of allergenic proteins in grass pollens.\r"

It is differentially expressed on B cell subpopulations, with no staining of the majority of small follicular mantle zone B cells but positive staining of the majority of marginal zone B cells of spleen. Like most CD45 antibodies, reactivity can be demonstrated in fresh frozen as well as in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. This reactivity clearly differs from all other published anti-CD45 antibodies. In immunoprecipitation and Western blot procedures, the antibody reacts with a major band with a molecular mass of 190 kDa and weak bands with molecular masses of 205 and 220 kDa. Compared to antibody PD7 that reacts with exon B-encoded sequences, the reactivity with the 205 and 220 bands is much weaker. This is reflected in MT3 reactivity with leukocyte common Ag transfectants that include exon B-encoded sequences, such as AB and B, but not with those that also include C-encoded sequences, such as ABC or BC. It can be concluded that MT3 recognizes additional heterogeneity in the leukocyte common Ag complex, that is based on the differential expression of sialic acid-dependent determinants associated with exon B-encoded sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Murine bone marrow cells expressing the cell surface Ag RB6-8C5 were identified by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis using a rat IgG mAb. The fluorescent intensity of RB6-8C5 was variable on bone marrow cells. This made it possible to separate bone marrow cells into distinct subpopulations, RB6-8C5neg, RB6-8C5lo, and RB6-8C5hi cells. Morphologic analysis of the sorted populations demonstrated that the Ag was expressed on myeloid cells. The expression of RB6-8C5 increases with granulocyte maturation, whereas expression is transient on cells in the monocytic lineage. The RB6-8C5hi sorted cells were enriched for end-stage neutrophils (75%), whereas the RB6-8C5lo sorted cells contained more immature myeloid cells and myelocytes (75%). Lymphocytes and macrophages were less than 5% in any RB6-8C5+ population, whereas the erythroid precursors were RB6-8C5neg. The colony forming unit culture (CFU-C) (greater than 90%) were found in the RB6-8C5neg and RB6-8C5lo populations, and all the CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, megakaryocyte, and macrophage (CFU-GEMM) and burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) were in the RB6-8C5neg population. Granulocyte-macrophage-CSFR (GM-CSFR) and IL-1 alpha R were expressed on RB6-8C5hi bone marrow cells, whereas no receptors could be detected on RB6-8C5neg and RB6-8C5lo cells. The expression of the RB6-8C5 Ag can be induced on RB6-8C5neg cells in liquid culture by IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF. Thus, RB6-8C5 is a myeloid differentiation Ag whose expression can be regulated by cytokines.\r"

Injection of mice with the mAb 7G6 prior to immunization with FITC haptenated Salmonella typhimurium (SH5771), Salmonella montevideo (SH5770), SRBC, or Ficoll dramatically decreased subsequent antibody responses to FITC. Although both IgM and IgG primary antibody responses were affected similarly, the antibody levels were most inhibited during early phases of the response. In contrast, down-modulation of the CR did not affect memory antibody responses, because injection of mice with 7G6 before a second immunization with FITC-SH5771 had no effect on subsequent anti-FITC antibody production. Moreover, polyclonal in vivo activation of the mouse immune system by anti-mouse IgD antibodies was not affected by previous administration of 7G6, because anti-IgD-induced increases in Ia expression and serum IgG1 levels were not affected. Taken together, these observations suggest that CR1 and CR2 may play an important role in enhancing primary antibody responses to many T-dependent and T-independent Ag and may contribute to a host's response to naturally occurring antigens such as bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "The phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent cell-derived bioactive molecule thought to be involved in diverse inflammatory processes. It has been shown that PAF can activate different leukocyte types and platelets, particularly in synergy with other agonists. In this study we examined the effect of PAF upon the release of histamine and leukotriene (LT) C4 by basophils when added alone and in combination with different agonists and cytokines. PAF by itself did neither induce histamine release nor the generation of LTC4 by basophils. However, basophils primed by the hematopoietic growth factors (hGF) IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, or IL-5 (10 ng/ml) released preformed and de novo synthesized mediators in response to PAF at 10 to 100 nM concentrations. The extent of mediator release by hGF primed basophils in response to PAF was similar to that induced by an optimal concentration of monoclonal anti-IgE. Thus, similar to NAP-1/IL-8 and C3a, PAF efficiently stimulates mediator release in hGF-primed basophils only. However, PAF was clearly a more potent trigger of LTC4 formation in IL-3-primed cells than NAP-1/IL-8 or C3a. When PAF was used as a second trigger, the priming effect of IL-5 was less than that of IL-3 or GM-CSF, whereas the response for other IgE-independent agonists (i.e., C5a or FMLP) was augmented equally by all three hGF. IL-1 beta-pretreated basophils released minimal amounts of histamine in response to PAF. Neither TNF-alpha nor PAF, nor the combination thereof, was able to induce basophil mediator release. The efficiency of the different cytokines to prime for PAF responsiveness was strikingly similar to their capacity to enhance anti-IgE-induced mediator release. Similar to other IgE-independent agonists, the kinetic of mediator release in response to PAF was very rapid. PAF pretreatment of basophils did not enhance mediator release in response to diverse agonists, such as C5a and FMLP, in contrast to the capacity of PAF to augment the response of other leukocyte types to appropriate stimuli. Thus, depending on the presence of IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-5, PAF is a potent basophil agonist capable of inducing histamine release as well as de novo synthesis of LTC4.\r"

The potent glucocorticosteroid, dexamethasone (DEX), inhibited the prolongation of eosinophil survival caused by culture in either VEC SUP or human rGM-CSF. DEX (10(-6) M) exerted a direct survival-inhibitory effect on the eosinophil by the 4th day in culture in VEC SUP. This survival-inhibitory effect was dependent on the concentration of DEX (10(-10)-10(-6) M). Other glucocorticoids, including prednisolone (10(-7), 10(-6) M) and hydrocortisone (10(-7), 10(-6) M) also inhibited survival. The rank order of potency of the steroids indicates that this effect is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor. This conclusion is supported by the failure of the sex steroids testosterone (10(-8)-10(-6) M) or beta-estradiol (10(-6) M) to inhibit eosinophil survival in the presence of VEC SUP. The effect of glucocorticoids on eosinophils is not a simple direct toxic effect because it was reversed by higher concentrations of GM-CSF. DEX shifted the GM-CSF dose-response curve for survival approximately fivefold to the right. GM-CSF induced a shift in eosinophil buoyant density which was partially blocked by DEX. These results suggest that glucocorticoids may inhibit elements of cytokine \"priming\" of eosinophils and that the eosinophilopenic effects of glucocorticoids may result in part from a direct effect on the eosinophil within a regulatory system involving cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of chemical oxidants to cells in culture has been shown to induce binding of low-molecular-weight thiols to reactive sulfhydryls on proteins in a process termed S-thiolation. We found that stimulation of the respiratory burst in mouse macrophages, with release of O2-, resulted in S-thiolation of several proteins, most prominently three with molecular weights of 74, 33, and 22 kDa. One protein (28 kDa) was S-thiolated without addition of an exogenous stimulus. Exposure of cells to concentrations of hydrogen peroxide like those released in the respiratory burst induced S-thiolation of these same proteins. S-thiolation and release of O2- began at approximately the same time. Stimulation of LPS-elicited macrophages induced prominent S-thiolation of three different proteins (38, 30, and 21 kDa). Under the conditions of these experiments, there was no detectable increase in glutathione disulfide and a negligible decrease in glutathione, which suggests that S-thiolation can occur without significant perturbation of the glutathione peroxidase/reductase cycle. S-thiolation of proteins could help protect the macrophage against the autoxidative damage associated with the respiratory burst. Modification of specific proteins by S-thiolation might serve to modulate cellular metabolic events.\r"

Culture supernatants obtained after 30-min incubation of adherent monocytes with EIgG, but not unopsonized sheep erythrocytes, markedly up-regulated the extent of PMN phagocytosis and enhanced the rate at which monocytes ingested EIgG. The presence of this factor(s) was first evident in phagocytic studies in which monocytes were prepared by a colloidal silica-based continuous gradient technique (Sepracell-Mn). After introduction of erythrocyte targets, there was a 20- to 30-min delay before initiation of phagocytosis that was not observed with monocytes prepared by the standard Percoll-gradient technique. Experiments suggest that, when compared with monocytes prepared by the Percoll-gradient method, Sepracell-Mn monocytes are closer to a base line state of activation with regard to the expression of Fc gamma RI and the ability to ingest EIgG. The mechanism of PMN upregulation by the monocyte factor(s) was explored. Monocyte supernatants did not induce an increase in the surface expression of PMN Fc gamma RI, II, or III. Neither anti-TNF, anti-IL-2, nor anti-GM-CSF had any significant effect on monocyte supernatant activity. Neutrophil activating protein-1 was not detected by ELISA. In contrast, anti-IL-1 completely blocked the effect of the supernatant on subsequent monocyte phagocytosis, and partially inhibited its effect on PMN phagocytosis. Furthermore, it was shown that RIL-1 as well as TNF markedly enhanced monocyte and PMN ingestion of EIgG. These results suggest that monocytes, after Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, release monokines, including at least IL-1, which enhance the phagocytic function of neighboring PMN and monocytes to augment the host defense process.\r"

This macrophage-activation process requires a serum factor. Fractionation studies with starch block electrophoresis of fetal calf and human sera revealed that alpha 2-globulin fraction contains a serum factor essential for macrophage activation. To identify the serum factor, human serum was precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and fractionated on a Sephadex G-100 column. A protein fraction with a lower m.w. than albumin had the capacity to support activation of macrophages. The active serum factor in this protein fraction was analyzed by immunoabsorption by using rabbit antisera against three major proteins of human alpha 2-globulin. This active serum factor was shown to be a vitamin D3-binding protein (group specific component, Gc). By using a monoclonal anti-Gc-absorbed active column fraction of human serum, we observed no enhanced macrophage activation over the results with serum fraction-free cultivation of lyso-Pc-treated peritoneal cells. Cultivation of lyso-Pc-treated peritoneal cells in a medium containing a low concentration of purified human Gc protein (0.1 to 2.6 ng/ml) produced a greatly enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages. When purified human Gc protein was used in a serum-free medium for stepwise cultivation of lyso-Pc-treated nonadherent cell types, a macrophage-activating factor was efficiently generated. Therefore, it is concluded that the vitamin D3-binding protein is the essential serum factor for the lyso-Pc-primed activation of macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study, we demonstrated that immunization of guinea pigs with the major secretory protein (MSP) of Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1 induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to MSP and protective immunity against lethal aerosol challenge with this serogroup of L. pneumophila. Although serogroup 1 L. pneumophila cause most cases of Legionnaires' disease, other serogroups of L. pneumophila and species of Legionella cause many cases. In this study, we have examined if immunization with MSP induces humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protective immunity across different serogroups of L. pneumophila and species of Legionella. By immunoblot analysis, MSP from L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1 MSP), L. pneumophila serogroup 6 (Lp6 MSP), and Legionella bozemanii (Lb MSP) shared common epitopes recognized by guinea pig anti-Lp1 MSP antiserum. These MSP molecules, however, were not identical as they had different apparent m.w. Immunization of guinea pigs with MSP induced strong cell-mediated immune responses across the different serogroups and species, as indicated by splenic lymphocyte proliferation and cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity in response to both homologous and heterologous MSP. Immunization with MSP induced strong protective immunity across two serogroups of L. pneumophila; overall, 9 survived aerosol challenge with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 compared to 0 of 12 (0%) sham-immunized control animals (p = 3 x 10(-4), Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel chi 2 statistic for pooled data). Immunization with MSP also induced protective immunity across species of Legionella but protection was species-specific. Whereas immunization with Lb MSP induced protective immunity against L. pneumophila, neither immunization with Lp1 MSP nor immunization with Lb MSP induced protective immunity against L. bozemanii, which produces MSP. Not surprisingly, immunization with MSP did not induce protective immunity against MSP-negative Legionella micdadei. In the case of both L. bozemanii and L. micdadei, immunization with a sublethal dose did confer protective immunity to aerosol challenge indicating that these species do contain immunoprotective components. This study demonstrates that immunization with MSP induces humoral and cell-mediated immune responses across different serogroups of L. pneumophila and species of Legionella, but that the capacity of MSP immunization to induce protective immunity is species-specific. Nevertheless, an MSP vaccine has the potential to induce protective immunity against the great majority of cases of Legionnaires' disease.\r"

  ".W": "The human T cell Ag CD27 belongs to a recently defined family of cell surface receptors, including the nerve growth factor receptor, two distinct tumor necrosis factor receptors, and the B cell specific molecule CD40. On resting T cells, CD27 is a transmembrane homodimer with subunits of 50 to 55 kDa (p55). T cell activation via the TCR/CD3 complex causes a strong enhancement of p55 expression. Concomitantly, an alternative form of the CD27 molecule with a molecular mass of 28 to 32 kDa (p32) appears at the cell surface. With the use of ELISA, we here show that a soluble form of CD27 (sCD27) can be detected in the supernatant of T cells activated with anti-CD3 or combinations of anti-CD2 mAb. Moreover, sCD27 is found in both serum and urine from healthy donors. sCD27, purified from either culture supernatant or urine, has a molecular mass of 28 to 32 kDa and is, according to peptide mapping, structurally homologous to the p55 membrane form of CD27. Quantification of sCD27 levels may be used as a marker for T lymphocyte activation in vivo.\r"

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was induced in Akata cells after stimulation with anti-IgG, as determined by immunoblotting with the PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. The frequency of phosphotyrosine-activated cells was also measured by immunofluorescence with the PY20 antibody. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, at non-cytotoxic doses blocked EBV activation, as measured in the induction of EBV Ag, EBV immediate early BZLF1 mRNA, and its protein product ZEBRA. Such inhibitions were reversed upon removing genistein from the cultures. Genistein inhibition of early Ag induction depended upon the time of addition of genistein after stimulation with anti-IgG. These findings indicate that activation of tyrosine kinase is required for EBV activation after cross-linking membrane IgG in Akata cells.\r"

Southern blot analysis of a positive clone identified a 4.4-kb fragment containing the entire coding region of the gene plus 2.4 kb upstream. Sequencing revealed the gene to encode a 621-amino acid protein, bearing 56% identity with the Escherichia coli dnaK gene product and 47% and 46% identity with the human and Caenorhabditis elegans hsp70, respectively. Comparison with the C-terminal 203 amino acids of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 71-kDa Ag yielded 70% identity. Recombinant M. leprae p70 was produced in E. coli as a fusion protein (rp70f) with a portion of the schistosomal glutathione-S-transferase, using the expression vector, pGEX-2T. Cleavage with thrombin resulted in the release of a 70.0-kDa protein (rp70c) from the glutathione-S-transferase. Examination of the proteins by immunoblotting demonstrated that anti-M. leprae mAb, L7, and sera from lepromatous leprosy patients bound to both the cleaved and fusion proteins. We compared the T cell reactivity of the M. leprae recombinant proteins with that of mAb affinity-purified bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 70-kDa Ag using proliferation assays. PBMC of BCG vaccinees responded to both M. leprae cleaved and fusion p70, though more subjects responded to the rp70c (18 of 20) than to rp70f (13 of 20). Responses were generally higher to rp70c than to rp70f, however all responses to the M. leprae recombinant proteins were lower than to mAb affinity-purified BCG p70. Thus, the M. leprae 70-kDa heat shock protein elicits T and B cell responses in subjects exposed to mycobacteria, despite its homology with the human hsp70.\r"

Therefore, the macaque monkey is proving to be an important model for testing the effectiveness of various AIDS vaccine approaches. A detailed analysis of the cellular immune responses is necessary for the evaluation of candidate vaccines. However, this has not been possible in macaques, due, in part, to the unknown nature of the MHC molecules that restrict their T lymphocytes. In our report we demonstrate that a particular MHC class I molecule involved in the rhesus monkey's effector T lymphocyte response to SIVmac is expressed at a high frequency in a colony of rhesus monkeys. SIVmac-infected monkeys that express this MHC class I molecule all develop CTL that are restricted by that molecule and recognize an identical nine amino acid epitope of the SIVmac gag protein. This MHC class I molecule has been defined as an HLA-A homolog by cDNA cloning and sequencing. It has also been expressed in an MHC class I-deficient cell line to demonstrate directly the cloned molecule's capacity to bind and present peptide Ag to CTL. These studies illustrate that AIDS virus-specific CTL can be characterized in detail in the rhesus monkey and lay the foundation for exploring novel approaches to AIDS virus vaccination in this species.\r"

In vitro studies have shown that lymphokine-activated mononuclear phagocytes inhibit intracellular replication of L. pneumophila. To determine if recovery from legionellosis is associated with activation of alveolar macrophages in vivo to resist L. pneumophila, we studied an animal model of Legionnaires' disease. Rats were exposed to aerosolized L. pneumophila and alveolar macrophages were harvested during the recovery phase of infection. We compared these alveolar exudate macrophages with normal resident alveolar macrophages for the capacity to support or inhibit the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. We also measured Ia expression as a marker of immunologic activation, and studied binding of bacteria, superoxide release, and the expression of transferrin receptors as potential mechanisms of resistance to L. pneumophila. For perspective on the specificity of these responses, we also studied alveolar exudate cells elicited by inhalation of heat-killed L. pneumophila, live Listeria monocytogenes, and live Escherichia coli. We found that alveolar exudate macrophages elicited by live L. pneumophila, but not heat-killed L. pneumophila, resisted the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Exudate macrophages in resolving legionellosis exhibited increased Ia expression, diminished superoxide production, and downregulation of transferrin receptors. Binding of L. pneumophila to exudate macrophages was indistinguishable from that to resident macrophages in the presence of normal serum, and augmented in the presence of immune serum. Alveolar exudate macrophages elicited by E. coli also inhibited growth of L. pneumophila, and exhibited a modest increase in Ia expression without change in transferrin receptors. Exudate cells induced by L. monocytogenes exhibited up-regulation of Ia without diminution of superoxide release. Alveolar cells harvested after inhalation of heat-killed L. pneumophila did not differ from resident alveolar macrophages in the expression of surface markers. These findings suggest that alveolar macrophages are immunologically activated in vivo to serve as effector cells in resolving legionellosis, and that live bacteria are required to induce this expression of immunity. The mechanism of resistance to parasitism by L. pneumophila may entail restriction of the intracellular availability of iron, but does not involve diminished bacterial binding or an augmented respiratory burst.\r"

  ".W": "Nine of eighteen chimpanzees inoculated with infective third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus developed patent infection with microfilariae in skin biopsies. In all infected chimpanzees the in vitro cellular reactivity to O. volvulus adult worm-derived Ag (OvAg) increased significantly after exposure to third-stage larvae. However, during prepatency the in vitro cellular responses to OvAg decreased gradually in subsequently mf positive (patent) animals, and returned with patency to values not different to those before infection. In non-patent chimpanzees cellular responses remained significantly higher than before infection. Stimulation of PBMC in vitro with bacterial Ag and mitogen did not show any differences between the experimental groups through 20 months p.i. The addition of exogenous IL-2 did not restore the impaired responses of PBMC to OvAg in patent animals. Exogenous IL-2 elicited an additive increase of the cellular response to OvAg in nonpatent, and a mitogenic effect to OvAg in patent animals. Selective depletion of adherent, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+), NK cells (CD16+) and the use of autologous serum had no effect on antigenic and mitogenic cellular responsiveness. OvAg-induced IL-2 production decreased after patency, whereas, IL-1 production was significantly greater in both patent and nonpatent than in control chimpanzees. In summary, these data demonstrate that experimental O. volvulus infection in chimpanzees stimulated a substantial cell-mediated immune response. In patent chimpanzees an OvAg-specific cellular hyporesponsiveness occurred before onset of patency, possibly due to decreased IL-2 production and responsiveness.\r"

Among these mAb, one group of mAb, represented by a mAb designated LAT-27, could neutralize the infectivity of HTLV-I, as determined by a HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion inhibition assay. LAT-27 also interfered with transformation of normal T lymphocytes by HTLV-I in vitro. An antibody-binding assay using overlapping synthetic oligopeptides showed that LAT-27 bound specifically to 10-mer peptides that contained the gp46 amino acid sequence 191-196 (Leu-Pro-His-Ser-Asn-Leu). Antibodies from HTLV-I+ humans interfered with the binding of LAT-27 to gp46 Ag. Sera from rabbits immunized with a LAT-27-reactive peptide, 190-199, conjugated with OVA, but not sera from OVA-immunized rabbits, reacted with gp46 Ag and neutralized infectivity of HTLV-I. These results show that the HTLV-I neutralization epitope recognized by LAT-27 locates to the gp46 amino acids 191-196, and that immunization with a peptide containing the LAT-27 epitope can elicit an HTLV-I neutralizing antibody response.\r"

Analysis of the properties of binding demonstrated that this does not simply result because only a fraction of the cells in the clonal population are capable of binding. Instead, the binding is shown to result from an equilibrium involving tightly bound and unbound (or weakly bound) cells. Thus, the cells cycle between a tightly bound and unbound state, despite continuous contact with the Ag-bearing surface. The results suggest that dissociation of the bound cells may be an actively signaled event. A model that could account for these results based on activated CD8 binding is discussed.\r"

LFA-1 consists of an alpha subunit (Mr = 180,000) and a beta subunit (Mr = 95,000). We report here the isolation and expression of the murine alpha subunit cDNA (GenBank accession no. M60778). The deduced sequence comprises a 1061 amino acid extracellular domain, a 29 amino acid transmembrane region, and a 50 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. It has a 72% amino acid identity with its human counterpart and 34% identity with the murine Mac-1 alpha subunit. The murine LFA-1 alpha subunit could be expressed on the cell surface of a fibroblastoid cell line, COS, by cotransfection with either the human or murine beta subunit cDNA.\r"

  ".U": "91268582\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate whether the retargeting of resting CTL can benefit from cooperative signaling between the TCR/CD3 complex and various accessory molecules, such as CD2, CD4, CD5, and CD8, we have constructed a series of trispecific F(ab')3 derivatives. Each derivative was designed to engage effector T lymphocytes with two Fab' arms, and tumor cells with a single Fab' arm. They were constructed by selective coupling of three mAb Fab' fragments, primarily via their hinge-region sulfhydryl groups, using the cross-linker o-phenylenedimaleimide. En route to the production of trispecific F(ab')3 antibodies a range of bispecific F(ab')2 derivatives was first prepared which could bind simultaneously to two different receptor molecules on T cells. Bispecific derivatives containing specificities for (CD2 (T11(1)) x CD3), (CD3 x CD4), (CD3 x CD8) or two epitopes on CD2, ((T11(1) x (T11(3)), all yielded two to three times the uptake of [3H]thymidine with fresh PBMC to that seen with intact IgG from anti-CD3 (OKT3). The exception to these findings was a bispecific F(ab')2 derivative with specificities for (CD3 x CD5) which caused slightly less proliferation than the control reagent, OKT3 IgG. When these bispecific antibodies were converted into trispecific antibodies (TsAb) by the addition of a Fab' from anti-CD37 they were then all able to retarget resting, unprimed, T cells from fresh PBMC for lysis of CD37+ tumor cells. However, the cytotoxic activity of these reagents fell into two distinct groups: group one, containing (anti-CD3 x anti-CD4 x anti-CD37), (anti-CD3 x anti-CD5 x anti-CD37), and (anti-CD3 x anti-CD8 x anti-CD37), gave minimal lysis and behaved in a similar way to the BsAb, (anti-CD3 x anti-CD37), i.e., no evidence of cooperative signaling for lysis; and group two, containing (anti-T11(1) x anti-CD3 x anti-CD37) and (anti-T11(1) x anti-T11(3) x anti-CD37), which were highly cytotoxic and gave up to 80% specific 51Cr-release. The failure of group one TsAb, in particular (anti-CD3 x anti-CD8 x anti-CD37) which should recruit CD8+ CTL, to give efficient lysis despite having anti-T cell arms that were mitogenic as a bispecific antibody, indicates that the cooperative signaling for proliferation is probably distinct from the signal(s) provided by group two TsAb that activate for both proliferation and lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The self-restriction of Ag-specific T cell responses is interpreted as the result of a positive selection of the individual's T cell specificities for their compatibility with self-MHC molecules. If the T cell receptor (TCR) specificities in any given individual have an affinity for syngeneic MHC molecules, it is unclear how they interact with allogeneic MHC structures. To approach this question, we analyzed 123 alloreactive HLA-DR4 Dw4 or Dw14 specific T cell clones that were generated from responder/stimulator combinations with defined disparities in the HLA-DR beta 1-chain. Sets of T cell clones were established from three different HLA-Dw4+ responders and compared for their fine specificities. The majority of HLA-DR4 Dw14 specific T cell clones co-recognized HLA-DR1 Dw1+ (33 to 36% of all T cell clones) or HLA-DRw14 Dw16+ (26 to 33%) stimulators, both of which share very similar sequences in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DR beta 1-chain with the HLA-DR4 alleles Dw4 and Dw14. These data suggest that sequence and structural similarities in the alpha-helical portions of the HLA-DR molecule impose a strong bias on the recognition of allotargets. The second haplotype of the responder did not appear to affect the typical fingerprint of T cell recognition except for the deletion of self-reactive TCR specificities. Nonrandom usage of TCR specificities in anti-HLA-DR responses was also found for HLA-DRw11/DRw13+ and HLA-DRw11/DR7+ T cell donors who did not share any obvious polymorphic sequence stretches with the allostimulators HLA-DR4 Dw4 or Dw14. T cell clones from an HLA-DRw11/DRw13+ responder functionally resembled the TCR specificities derived from the HLA-DR4 Dw4+ donors. T cell clones derived from an HLA-DRw11/DR7+ individual were characterized by a distinct cross-reactivity pattern preferring HLA-DRw13 Dw19+ (50 to 60%) and HLA-DR3+ (43 to 57%) stimulator cells. These findings suggest that the responder HLA-DR alleles influence the structural constraints in the recognition of allo-HLA-DR molecules in closely related and in completely disparate responder/stimulator combinations.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperacute rejection does not occur when vascularized organs are transplanted between rat and mouse, and this species combination is considered to be concordant. Since hyperacute rejection is believed to reflect the presence of pre-existing antibodies (usually of the IgM class), and lymphocytotoxic antibodies against rat cells have not been detected in normal mouse sera, it has previously been concluded that mouse anti-rat natural antibody (NAb) does not exist. However, studies have not been reported in which rat bone marrow cells (BMC) were used as targets for evaluation of normal mouse sera. Because previous work from our and other laboratories has shown that bone marrow chimerism in the rat into mouse species combination can be achieved only by transplanting large numbers of rat BMC, we have evaluated normal mouse sera for the presence of NAb against rat BMC that might explain these in vivo results. Fisher 344 rat BMC and spleen cells were incubated with serum from nonimmunized mice, then stained with fluoresceinated rat anti-mouse subclass-specific secondary reagents and analyzed using flow cytometry. NAb of the IgM and IgG3 classes were found that bound strongly to rat BMC but showed weak or absent binding to spleen cells. A low level of IgG2b binding was observed to both BMC and spleen cells. Cytotoxic activity was detected against rat BMC but not against spleen cells. The environment in which the animals were maintained played a significant role in determining the level of cytotoxic NAb in normal mouse sera. Our results are consistent with the possibility that bone marrow-specific NAb play a role in resisting engraftment of BMC across this species barrier.\r"

We now show that these primed B cells can be efficiently immortalized by fusion with a heterohybrid fusion partner to generate human, Ag-specific IgM or IgG antibody-producing heterohybridomas at a rate of 17 to 50 hybrids/10(6) lymphocytes fused. Approximately 50% of the Ig-secreting clones were stable with respect to Ig secretion. Levels of secretion attained with terminal cultures ranged from less than 1 to 100 micrograms/ml. Fusions of cells between 2 and 5 days after initiation of in vitro exposure to Ag produced more Ag-reactive and Ag-specific antibodies than fusions at 1 day or fusions performed after 5 days. Ag-reactive hybrids could be isolated at frequencies of 3 to 10%, depending on antigenicity of the immunogen. Foreign proteins, horse spleen ferritin, and a murine monoclonal Ig, induced higher percentages of Ag-reactive mAb than immunization with the human-derived ferritin. Ag-reactive IgG mAb were produced at relatively high frequency, depending on immunization conditions and the nature of the Ag. The strategy for identification of the best hybrids included early elimination of unstable hybridomas and of hybridomas producing broadly cross-reactive antibody, followed by evaluation of units of Ag reactivity/micrograms Ig. Ferritin-specific mAb selected according to these criteria showed immunocytochemical reactivity with ferritin-containing tissues and apparent affinities in the range of 10(7) to 10(8)/mol.\r"

  ".U": "91268587\r", 
  ".W": "Fungal infections of skin or nails are extremely common and often caused by dermatophyte fungi of the genus Trichophyton. These fungi are unusual in that they can give rise to delayed hypersensitivity (DH) or immediate hypersensitivity (IH) responses. Recently, IH to Trichophyton tonsurans has been demonstrated in patients by skin tests, serum IgE antibody test (RAST), and positive nasal and bronchial challenges. To further investigate the immunology of Trichophyton, a 30-kDa T. tonsurans allergen was isolated by gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This protein, Tri t I, gave a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the 30 amino-terminal amino acids have been determined. Among patients with positive IH skin tests, 34 of 48 (71%) had IgG antibody and 26 of 48 (54%) had IgE antibody to Tri t I. Among those who had positive responses to both skin tests and RAST, 22 of 30 (73%) had IgE antibodies to Tri t I; thus, this protein represents a major allergen. Twelve clones of murine IgG mAb antibodies were produced. Two clones, 2F2-F7 and 6B11-C2, were found to define separate epitopes on Tri t I and were used to develop an immunometric assay for the quantitation of Tri t I. Twenty-three of 38 volunteers with a history of athlete's foot were found to have either IH and/or DH to Trichophyton mix and underwent further testing with purified Tri t I. Of the nine found to have IH to the mix, eight were sensitive to Tri t I. Seven of these eight had IgG and IgE antibodies to Tri t I, by Ag-binding RIA, and all were RAST positive to the unpurified extract. An additional 14 had either DH alone (n = 7) or a wheal and flare response followed by DH at 48 h (n = 7). Of these 14 who had DH responses to Trichophyton mix, only one showed DH to an equivalent quantity of purified Tri t I; among this group, none showed IH or serum IgE antibodies and only one had detectable IgG antibody to Tri t I. The results suggest that the majority of subjects with DH to Trichophyton are responding to a protein other than Tri t I and that the wheal that precedes DH reactions is some patients is not associated with IgE antibodies.\r"

One school of thought, the \"eliminative materialistics,\" see FP as a misdirected and scientifically redundant approach to the mind which should be discarded; the \"functionalists,\" in contrast, consider FP categories, such as belief, to be essential. Between these extremes other neurophilosophical positions affect the way we view mental life. This paper extends the debate to include a consideration of abnormal mental states. It is argued that approaches to phenomenology and psychopathology cannot be immune from any conceptual reconfiguration of normal mental life which might occur. The manner and extent to which psychiatric theory and practice may be affected as a result of these developments is discussed.\r"

Scales were administered to a general population sample (N = 274) and a sample of patients with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder (N = 133). Scales demonstrated satisfactory levels of internal consistency. Some dimensions showed a low correlation with other dimensions defining the same diagnosis. These dimensions could be eliminated without affecting reliability. The structure underlying the dimensions delineating each diagnosis was evaluated using factor analysis. For each diagnosis, the structure was highly similar in the two samples. Based on these results, specific proposals are made for redefining diagnoses.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative abilities of four different approaches to the identification of borderlines and to differentiate a DSM-III-R BPD group from a control group of other diagnoses. The approaches were the Kernberg's Structural Interview, the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Personality Disorders (DIB), the Borderline Syndrome Index (BSI), and the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI). Sixty outpatient volunteers (27 men and 33 women) from a community mental health center served as subjects. The volunteers included 30 BPDs and 30 other diagnoses, including 11 non-BPD personality disorders. Point biserial correlations indicated that the best method for identifying DSM-III-R BPD was the DIB, and the second best was the Kernberg Structural Interview, although all four identified DSM-III-R BPDs at better than chance levels. Multiple regression results showed that the DIB accounted for 61.5% of the BPD variance, while the Kernberg approach added 4.9% more unique variance prediction. MCMI dimensions and personal history characteristics were used to identify differentiators of BPD from all other diagnoses and from other personality disorders.\r"

Both MMPI and Rorschach findings suggest a general trend for borderline groups to produce relatively unique findings. Their usefulness in yielding accurate individual diagnoses of BPD, however, has not yet been established. Furthermore, no supportive evidence was found for the commonly held hypothesis that BPD subjects show more impairment on unstructured measures than on objective measures.\r"

Greater intake increased net PDV removal of glucose and urea nitrogen and net PDV release of NH3N, alpha-amino nitrogen (AAN), alanine and lactate. Lower net PDV release of NH3N, liver removal of NH3N and AAN and liver release of urea nitrogen accompanied lower N intake and digestion in heifers fed the 75% concentrate vs. the 75% alfalfa diet. Lower net PDV glucose removal resulted in greater total splanchnic glucose release when heifers were fed the 75% concentrate vs. the 75% alfalfa diet. In addition, net PDV, liver and total splanchnic release of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) were lower when heifers were fed the 75% concentrate vs. the 75% alfalfa diet. Greater tissue energy retention in heifers fed the 75% concentrate vs. the 75% alfalfa diet at equal metabolizable energy intake accompanied differences in net PDV metabolism of glucose, NH3N and BOHB and liver metabolism of nitrogenous compounds, BOHB and lactate.\r"

Retinol and retinol-binding protein levels remained virtually constant throughout the study. Following absorption of vitamin A, retinyl esters as well as all-trans-retinoic acid and 13-cis-retinoic acid were transiently increased in plasma. 13-cis-4-Oxoretinoic acid increased gradually to a steady state level present on d 10 or 20. All-trans-4-oxoretinoic acid was not detected in plasma of the volunteers, with the exception of one on d 10 of the study. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of retinyl esters and polar metabolites of retinol displayed great interindividual differences (peak concentrations, time to peak, area-under-the-concentration-time curve values) among the volunteers. Because of the relatively high and consistent steady state concentrations of plasma 13-cis-4-oxoretinoic acid, we suggest that this compound be further investigated as a biochemical marker of vitamin A uptake in humans.\r"

Restriction of dietary copper (less than or equal to 1 mg/kg vs. 6 mg/kg in adequate diets) at weaning in both sexes for a 6-wk period produced cardiac hypertrophy. Male rats developed more severe copper-deficiency symptoms than their female counterparts. In both sexes of copper-deficient rats, there was an increase in cardiac length, width, free ventricular wall thickness and septum thickness. Electrocardiographic tracings revealed greater QRS height among male copper-deficient rats. Heart rate also was substantially reduced in this group. The increased volume of myocardium occupied by mitochondria in the copper-deficient male rats might result in increased electrical resistance that would increase the QRS height; hypertrophy or anemia also could be contributory. Some male copper-deficient rats had prolongation of the QRS in a bundle branch block pattern. Maximal rates of rise and fall for left ventricular pressure were reduced in male copper-deficient rats. The gross histology indicated that this type of heart failure was more concentric than eccentric. The copper-deficient male rat may serve as a useful model for studying the concentric cardiac hypertrophy that occurs in humans.\r"

However, there was wide variation in Mn turnover rates among tissues. Liver, kidney and whole body contained readily exchangeable manganese in much higher proportions than did bone.\r"

Heart carnitine tended to be lower in piglets fed Diet 3, but the differences were not significant. Longissimus muscle carnitine was not affected. In vitro palmitate oxidation was lower (P less than 0.05) on d 7 in the liver from piglets fed Diet 3 but not on d 3, 14 and 21.

Piglets receiving Diet 3 had reduced carnitine in plasma and certain tissues, and liver lipid oxidation was depressed on d 7 of age, compared with those receiving the other two diets.

  ".W": "A depletion-repletion model was used to study the effect of the level of dietary protein on the vitamin B-6 requirement of growing kittens. Twenty kittens were given a pyridoxine-free diet for 42 d to deplete vitamin B-6 reserves. They then were divided into four groups of five kittens each. Two groups were fed diets containing 30% casein with either 1.0 (Group 30-1) or 2.0 (Group 30-2) mg pyridoxine/kg diet and two groups were fed 60% casein diets with either 1.0 (Group 60-1) or 2.0 (Group 60-2) mg pyridoxine/kg diet for 44 d. During repletion, body weight gain of kittens from Group 30-2 was higher than that of kittens from the other groups. Body weight gains of kittens from Groups 30-1 and 60-2 were higher than that of kittens from Group 60-1, but there was no difference in body weight gain between Groups 30-1 and 60-2. At 44 d of repletion, kittens from Group 60-1 generally had higher plasma concentrations of free tyrosine and cystathionine, lower plasma B-6 vitamin concentrations and a higher urinary oxalate excretion than did kittens from the other groups. These findings indicate that the vitamin B-6 requirement of growing kittens--as is true of humans, chickens and mice--is positively related to the level of protein in the diet. For a 30% casein diet, the vitamin B-6 requirement was greater than or equal to 1.0 but less than 2.0 mg pyridoxine/kg diet; for a 60% casein diet, the requirement was greater than or equal to 2.0 mg pyridoxine/kg diet.\r"

The protocol consisted of a 5-d baseline period and four experimental periods during which the subjects successively received 0.003, 0.015, 0.0225 and 0.03375 mg of vitamin B-6/(kg body wt.d). Dietary protein was 1.2 or 0.8 g/(kg body wt.d). At 5- or 6-d intervals, xanthurenic acid (XA) after a 5-g L-tryptophan load and 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) in 24-h urine, erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity coefficient (EAST-AC) and plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) were measured. These measurements were abnormal during vitamin B-6 depletion but returned to normal during repletion. Men who ingested approximately 120 g protein/d required 1.96 +/- 0.11 mg of vitamin B-6 to normalize XA; women who ingested 78 g protein/d required 1.90 +/- 0.18 mg of vitamin B-6 to normalize XA. To attain normal levels of EAST-AC and 4-PA in men, 2.88 +/- 0.17 mg of vitamin B-6 were needed; to normalize PLP, 1.96 +/- 0.11 mg of vitamin B-6 were required. Women required 1.90 +/- 0.18 mg or more of vitamin B-6 to normalize these measurements. Vitamin B-6 requirements were not decreased in two of three subjects who ingested 54 g of protein daily. Thus, vitamin B-6 requirements of elderly men and women are about 1.96 and 1.90 mg/d, respectively.\r"

One low fat diet (low fat 1) was similar in texture to the control diet. The other low fat diet (low fat 2) was comparable to the high fat diet. Digestible energy was 92-95% of gross dietary energy in all diets. There was no effect of diet composition on energy intake of the rats. At the end of the study, animals given low fat diets weighed approximately 20 g more than those fed control or high fat diets, due to increased lean body mass. Diet had no significant effect on body fat content, gastrocnemius muscle weight or femur length. This study indicates that increasing the protein:energy ratio of the diet by replacing nonessential fat with a fat substitute may promote deposition of lean tissue rather than fat in growing animals.\r"

The effect of exercise in combination with the sucrose diet was also evaluated by exercising half of the sucrose-fed group on a motorized treadmill. Insulin-receptor function was assessed in vitro by measuring the binding capacity of [125I]-insulin to partially purified receptors of the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis. Tyrosine kinase activity was measured as an index of postreceptor function. Insulin-receptor number was significantly decreased in 24-mo-old sucrose-fed rats compared to 12-mo-old rats fed the sucrose or sucrose-free diets. The affinity of insulin for the receptor did not significantly differ among groups. Maximal tyrosine kinase activity in vastus lateralis was significantly decreased in 12-mo-old sucrose-fed rats compared with sedentary 24-mo-old rats fed the sucrose-free diet or 24-mo-old rats fed the sucrose diet in combination with exercise. Exercise prevented the decrease in receptor function in both 12- and 24-mo-old sucrose-fed rats as measured by insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activity. These data suggest that diet and/or exercise rather than aging per se has a greater influence on insulin-receptor function.\r"

Direct measurement of food intake by individual fish within a school is nearly impossible. We examined the relationship between growth and liver enzyme activity as a means of inferring the food intake of individual fish within a school. Trout, identified by passive integrated transponder implants, were fed either 0, 0.3, 1, or 2% body mass/d to produce a wide range of growth rates. The activities of five enzymes, predominantly localized in liver, were measured. Results showed that, although the magnitude of response differed, increases in total liver activities of all five enzymes measured were linearly related to growth. Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) increased at a rate below, and beta-D-glucose:NAD(P)+1-oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.47) increased at a rate equivalent to, observed increases in total liver mass. Malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) showed preferential increases in activity as food intake increased. Correlation of enzyme activities measured in fish fed restricted rations with either growth or nominal feeding rate showed that growth of individual fish was more closely related to liver enzyme activities than nominal feeding rate.\r"

We also studied the changes that occurred in response to 10 or 18 h of fasting at 5, 10, 16 and 28 d of age. Protein synthesis was measured in vivo using a flooding dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. Fractional protein synthesis rates (FSR, %/d) of stomach and small intestines increased nearly 80% during the period normally associated with weaning (d 18 to 28). Between birth and 28 d, the pancreas FSR increased approximately 6.5-fold from 46 to 302%/d. The increases in stomach, small intestinal and pancreatic FSR were largely due to increases in translational efficiency (gram protein synthesized per gram RNA). At 5, 10, 16 and 28 d postpartum, both the FSR and translational efficiency in pancreatic and small intestinal tissues were decreased after 10 h of fasting; however, measures in stomach tissue were largely unaffected. The magnitude of decline in FSR and translational efficiency in response to fasting was greater during the earlier than in the later stages of development. The results suggest that the FSR in the pancreas, small intestines and stomach of suckling rats increase during the period of development associated with weaning. Fasting affected protein synthetic activity more profoundly in pancreatic and small intestinal tissue in the early stages of development.\r"

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) were fed diets containing between 2 and 63% of energy as fat for 64 d. Inclusion of a substitute resulted in diets of different fat content but similar texture. When 10% corn oil (21% kJ-fat diet) was replaced with the substitute supplemented with linoleic acid (2% kJ-fat diet), rats increased food intake so that there was no effect on energy intake, body weight, body composition or serum lipid profile. Rats fed a diet containing 10% corn oil and 30% Crisco vegetable shortening (63% kJ-fat diet) became obese and hyperinsulinemic. When half (51% kJ-fat diet) or all (30% kJ-fat diet) of the Crisco was replaced with the fat substitute, the rats increased food intake and were fatter than controls but less obese than rats fed the 63% kJ-fat diet. Hepatic lipid oxidation and ketone synthesis were proportional to the percentage of dietary energy as fat. Adipocyte de novo lipid synthesis was inhibited by 51% kJ-fat and 63% kJ-fat diets. Partial or total replacement of Crisco prevented the hyperinsulinemia observed in 63% kJ-fat rats, suggesting a protective effect against the development of insulin resistance with diet-induced obesity.\r"

Alanine, hydroxyproline and lysine also increased plasma GIP, but insulin concentrations were unchanged. In contrast, threonine failed to affect either GIP or insulin concentrations. There was no correlation between either the incremental or integrated GIP and insulin responses, and none of the amino acids administered affected circulating glucose concentrations. The results indicate that a range of essential and nonessential neutral and basic amino acids stimulate the release of GIP in ob/ob mice. However, GIP made only a modest contribution to the stimulation of insulin secretion following administration of amino acids in the presence of basal glycemia.\r"

  ".W": "The activity, synthesis rate and mRNA level of pancreatic lipase increase with dietary fat intake. Ketones, intermediates of lipid metabolism, have been proposed to mediate this change. Therefore, we investigated their direct effect on cultured pancreatic acinar cells and examined their possible interactive effects with glucose and dietary fat. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (0.01 to 2 mmol/L) did not affect lipase activity in cells isolated from rats fed a commercial nonpurified (NP) diet and cultured in high glucose (HG, 27.8 mmol/L) or low glucose (LG, 6.9 mmol/L) medium. The effects of ketones were also examined in acinar cells isolated from rats fed purified high fat (HF, 67% of energy from fat) or low fat (LF, 11% of energy from fat) diet. Cellular lipase was significantly higher in cells from HF-fed rats at both 24 and 48 h (264% and 145% of LF values, respectively; P less than 0.0001). beta-Hydroxybutyrate significantly increased (P less than 0.04) lipase activity in LF cells at 48 h but did not affect lipase activity in HF cells. These studies suggest that ketones may be involved in the regulation of pancreatic lipase in rats fed a LF diet, but their role is complex and interactive with dietary carbohydrate and fat.\r"

The blood glucose level also was lowered in mice fed sorbose, but the serum insulin level was unchanged. Glucose was not detected in the urine of mice fed the sorbose diet during the experiment, but some mice in the control group excreted glucose in urine. Relative weights of the heart, liver and left kidney were significantly higher in mice fed the sorbose diet vs. those fed the control diet.

The animals were fed 7.5 or 15% (wt/wt) fat diets containing either polyunsaturated corn oil (CO), monounsaturated olive oil (OL) or saturated lard as the fat source. Dietary fat quality had a number of significant effects: animals fed the CO-based diet had lower plasma LDL levels and LDL particles of higher density with decreased ratios of core-to-surface components. Apoprotein B/E receptor-mediated binding of LDL to hepatic membranes was twofold higher for animals fed the CO-based diet. Animals fed the OL-based diet had lower hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and increased levels of hepatic cholesterol. Hepatic cholesteryl ester levels were lowest for animals fed the lard-based diet. Increasing dietary fat quantity resulted in increased plasma LDL levels and hepatic cholesterol, HMG-CoA reductase activity and receptor affinity for LDL. No changes were observed in LDL binding. These data demonstrate that, independent of dietary fat quantity, CO-based diets lower plasma LDL levels, modify LDL composition and increase hepatic apoprotein B/E receptor number.\r"

Addition of cholesterol to the diets caused even greater mean differences between the animals fed different types of protein, but the increased inter-animal variability of response to the added cholesterol resulted in less statistically significant differences. Although less responsive than the nonhybrid Golden Syrian hamsters, hybrid F1B hamsters showed similar effects of dietary casein vs. soybean protein on plasma lipids. These results indicate that the hamster may be a useful model to examine the effect of different types of protein and the interaction with dietary cholesterol on various plasma lipids and lipoproteins.\r"

Apparent absorption of 18:1(n-9) and polyunsaturated fatty acids was not dependent on the fatty acid profile of the dietary fat. Apparent absorption of 16:1(n-7) and saturated fatty acids was generally highest in the rats fed fish oil. Intake of fish oil or peanut oil significantly decreased plasma triglyceride content. Intake of fish oil resulted in substantially decreased contents of total cholesterol and cholesterolesters in plasma, but intake of peanut oil did not.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets containing varied ratios of corn oil/carbohydrate for 4 d. Rats fed diets with higher fat/carbohydrate ratios produced higher serum acetone levels and higher hepatic microsomal P450IIE1 content and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity than those fed diets with lower fat/carbohydrate ratios. This dietary fat/carbohydrate effect on P450IIE1 also was observed with modified semipurified AIN-76A diets. In addition, both the quantity and the extent of unsaturation of dietary lipids affected P450IIE1 regulation. At moderate fat levels (5 and 20% diet), rats fed corn oil and menhaden oil diets produced higher P450IIE1 activity than those fed lard and olive oil diets. Rats fed a diet containing 20% corn oil or an amount of linoleic acid equivalent to the 20% corn oil diet showed twofold to threefold increases in the level of P450IIE1 over those fed a fat-free diet. Rats fed a 25% corn oil diet showed twofold higher enflurane metabolism in vivo than those fed a 0.5% corn oil diet.

Formation of metabolites from labeled arachidonic acid (AA) by thrombocytes was similar in the S+E and S-E groups, yielding thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and hydroxy fatty acids as the major products. Collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation and TXB2 production were not significantly different in the S-E and S+E groups, but aggregation values and TXB2 synthesis were significantly less in the L-E group than in the ataxic S-E chicks. Prostaglandin E2 production by aortal rings was significantly influenced by the diet; S-E yielded the highest value and L-E the lowest.

The relative importance of urea cycle enzyme activities, substrate levels or the levels of urea cycle intermediates on urea production was investigated in a set of four experiments in which rats were fed a diet supplemented with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU, a thyroid inhibitor) and treated with triiodothyronine (T3). Compared with that of normal or control rats, the plasma level of T3 was significantly lower in rats fed a diet containing PTU only and elevated in rats given PTU + T3. Urinary excretion of urea and the liver content of ornithine in rats given PTU + T3 were significantly lower than in rats given PTU only. The liver level of ornithine was closely correlated to the excretion of urea in the present study. Fractional rates of protein synthesis in liver, kidney and small intestine were lower in the hypothyroid group. However, most free amino acid concentrations, except ornithine in liver and plasma and the activity of hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.5) of hypothyroid rats, were significantly reduced as compared with those of control or hyperthyroid rats. The results indicate that the increased hepatic ornithine content in the hypothyroid rats may be one of the regulatory factors causing changes in urea synthesis.\r"

Increasing all indispensable amino acids by 20% from their original levels improved weight gain and gain:feed ratio to levels equivalent to those of pigs fed a 20% protein corn-soybean meal-dried whey positive control diet. Replacing the glutamate-glycine-proline dispensable amino acid mixture with a complete mixture of dispensable amino acids (i.e., glutamate, glycine, proline, glutamine, serine, alanine, aspartate and asparagine) did not improve growth rate. A balance study showed that retention of nitrogen and energy (percentage of intake) from the final purified diet was superior to that of pigs fed the corn-soybean meal-dried whey diet. Metabolizable energy and metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen retention of the final purified amino acid diet were determined to be 14.43 and 13.96 MJ/kg diet, respectively. The chemically defined diet developed here for young pigs provides a means of studying nutrient utilization in the pig under conditions in which all nutrients are essentially 100% bioavailable.\r"

Soybean protein, casein, whole egg protein and egg albumen were used at the nitrogen level of 2.7 g/100 g diet. These experimental diets contained 0.354, 0.540, 0.945 and 1.22 g sulfur amino acids/100 g, respectively. In the rats fed fiber-free diets, a substantial quantity of glycine-conjugated bile acids was detected in the bile of immature rats fed soybean protein and casein (73 and 25% of total bile acids, respectively), but not in the other groups (less than 13%). Dietary pectin increased bile acid excretion both in immature (48-77%) and mature (34-114%) rats irrespective of the protein source, except in immature rats fed egg albumen and mature rats fed whole egg protein. Because a pectin-dependent increase in bile acid excretion was essentially attributed to the increase in glycine-conjugates, this dietary fiber significantly increased the ratio of glycine-conjugates to taurine-conjugates (2.4- to 6.5-fold). This increase was accompanied by a 40-50% decrease in the concentration of liver taurine, except in immature rats fed soybean protein and egg albumen. However, there was no consistent relationship between the extent of taurine conjugation and the activity of liver cysteine dioxygenase, one of the rate-limiting enzymes in taurine synthesis.\r"

Hepatitis B was associated with a fourfold risk for early progression and syphilis with a nearly threefold risk. Skin test anergy for Candida species was strikingly predictive: all of 17 tested in the early progression group were anergic, compared with only two of 12 tested in the late progression group. Although skin testing has been largely supplanted by assessment of T-cell subsets, Candida species skin testing may be of particular prognostic value in otherwise apparently healthy HIV-infected persons.\r"

All marrow examinations of patients with known or suspected HIV infection in which specimens were examined histopathologically and/or microbiologically for opportunistic pathogens or lymphoma were analyzed. Bone marrow examination resulted in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in 16% of the patients studied. Blood culture was 77% sensitive and bone marrow culture was 86% sensitive for detecting disseminated mycobacterial infection. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). Disseminated fungal infections occurred in less than 5% of the patients studied, and most were rapidly and accurately detected by examination of stained bone marrow samples. No case of lymphoma was diagnosed by bone marrow examination. Bone marrow examination may be useful for diagnosing opportunistic infections in patients with HIV infection. Mycobacterial blood cultures have a sensitivity comparable to bone marrow cultures in detecting disseminated mycobacterial infections, are less invasive, and may be less costly. Marrow examination is not useful for diagnosing lymphoma but can determine the extent of lymphoma that has been diagnosed by other means.\r"

  ".W": "Polyhydroxycarboxylates (MW: 3,800-14,000) derived from phenolic (PDP) compounds have been found to inhibit the cytopathicity of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT-4 cells at concentrations that are not toxic to the host cells. The PDP compounds also inhibited syncytium formation in cocultures of MOLT-4 cells with HIV-1- or HIV-2-infected HUT-78 cells. They also interfered with the binding of OKT4A/leu3a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the CD4 receptor, the binding of anti-gp120 mAb to HIV-1 gp120, and attachment of HIV-1 virions to MT-4 cells. The anti-HIV activity in this series of compounds can be ascribed to inhibition of the gp120-CD4 interaction and seems to depend on the presence of the anionic carboxylate groups. Their mechanism of action is similar to that of the heterogeneous polymer aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA).\r"

  ".W": "In addition to their properties as sequence-specific inhibitors of gene expression, sequence nonspecific phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides have been shown to protect against the cytopathic effects of HIV-1. Although these compounds are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in vitro, it is not certain that they exert their cytoprotective effect only in this manner. Initial binding of the HIV-1 virion to cells involves the interaction of the viral envelope protein gp120 with CD4. In this report, we describe flow cytometric data and a solid-phase ELISA assay that document the ability of a phosphorothioate deoxycytidine 28-mer to interfere with this interaction by competing with gp120 binding to CD4. The biological importance of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine inhibits syncytium formation resulting from HIV-1-induced cell fusion. These data suggest that phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides may exert their cytoprotective effects, perhaps at least in part, by interfering with the binding of HIV-1 to the target cells.\r"

These antibodies inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type IIIB (HIV-IIIB) infection of H9 cells in vitro; 5 micrograms/ml of antibodies against mannan from serotype A and 10 micrograms/ml of antibodies against serotype B mannan were sufficient to inhibit infection by almost 100 and 85%, respectively, after an incubation period of 4 days. During a prolonged incubation period (8-12 days), the amount of HIV particles (as measured by reverse transcriptase activity in the culture medium) increased again in assays with antibodies raised against serotype B, but only little in assays containing antibodies against serotype A. Applying the Western blotting technique and a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system it was established that the antibodies reacted with the gp120 of HIV-1 exclusively. Immunofluorescence inspection using a confocal laser scanning microscope revealed that the gp120 protein is exposed on the outer surface of H9 cells where it is recognized by the anti-mannan antibodies. These results indicate that mannan residues of C. albicans can serve as antigens to raise neutralizing antibodies against HIV infection.\r"

In participants with symptomatic HIV infection without AIDS and in those with less than 200 CD4 cells, ZDV use increased initially but then leveled off (from 6 to 25% and 24 to 55%, respectively). Zidovudine use with more than 500 CD4 cells increased from 0.5 to 4%. In 1989 AP use with less than 200 CD4 cells was 42% and with AIDS was 44%. Whereas 50% of participants with AIDS and less than 200 CD4 were using both ZDV and AP, only 14% of those without AIDS but with less than 200 CD4 cells were using both. Surprisingly few members of these cohorts are using therapies proven effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection.\r"

Abbott, Coulter, and Du Pont antigen kits were used to test 661 sera collected sequentially from 65 members of the Toronto Sexual Contact Study (TSCS). The sera had been collected at 3-month intervals over 4 years from nine persistently HIV-seronegative men, 14 seroconverters, and 42 seroprevalent participants. Antigen was not detected in any seronegative men. Two of 14 seroconverters were antigen positive in the specimen immediately preceding seroconversion (by all kits). Antigen was detected in 22 of 56 seropositive participants; of these, 16 of 22 demonstrated the emergence of antigen during observation. Discrepancies were noted in the time of detection of antigen (ranging from 3 months to more than 3 years) in nine participants. Although overall concordance among all kits for all specimens appears high (95.4%), when the bias introduced by testing multiple specimens from the same patient is removed, the lower bound of concordance among all three kits is estimated to be 80%. Similarly, after correction, the upper and lower bound of estimates of sensitivity are Abbott 96, 92%; Coulter 88, 63%; and Du Pont 88, 58%. There are significant differences in the performance characteristics of these commercial products for the detection of HIV antigen in serum.\r"

It is particularly difficult to set out precise limits on its duration. Many withdrawal symptoms are a result of pharmacodynamic tolerance to benzodiazepines, some mechanisms for which are discussed. Such tolerance develops unevenly in different brain systems and may be slow to reverse. Withdrawal symptoms occurring in the first week after cessation of drug use tend to merge with more persistent symptoms that may last for many months. These prolonged symptoms do not necessarily constitute \"true\" pharmacological withdrawal symptoms, but are nevertheless related to long-term benzodiazepine use. Such symptoms can include anxiety, which may partly result from a learning deficit imposed by the drugs, and a variety of sensory and motor neurological symptoms. The protracted nature of some of these symptoms raises the possibility that benzodiazepines can give rise not only to slowly reversible functional changes in the central nervous system, but may also occasionally cause structural neuronal damage.\r"

  ".W": "Benzodiazepines, which are among the safest and most effective drugs, possess all the characteristic of abuseable compounds. Although there appear to be differences in potency among compounds and variations in sensitivity among individuals, benzodiazepines have clear reinforcing properties. Tolerance to the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is rapid, but tolerance to the anxiolytic effects develops slowly and to a limited extent. Although abusers use very high doses, most long-term users persist at daily doses in the low therapeutic range (10-20 mg of diazepam or its equivalent) without dose escalation. Physical dependence is a risk associated with long-term use, even at therapeutic doses. The withdrawal syndrome is mild at low doses. Continued self-administration of low therapeutic doses is maintained to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The advances in the recent understanding of the molecular biology of the benzodiazepine receptor gives hope to the development of new anxiolytic compounds with less dependence liability than the present ones.\r"

The nonmedical use in medical populations is underestimated and underdiagnosed. The nonmedical use is also misdiagnosed in nonmedical populations as medical use.

The elderly appear to be more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, both because of changed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with aging and because of altered postreceptor cerebral response. All problems identified with benzodiazepines such as dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive and psychomotor impairment are proportionally greater among the elderly, who can least afford these risks. Review of the literature leads to the conclusion that benzodiazepine prescribing for the elderly should be undertaken with the greatest caution and only with the recognition of all potentially disastrous effects.\r"

The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) indicates they are the most mentioned benzodiazepines, and the National Household Survey indicates significant abuse of tranquilizers. Both drugs are rapidly absorbed and enter the brain tissue rapidly, leading to reinforcement. Alprazolam has a shorter half-life, which may lead to more withdrawal symptoms than diazepam. In experimental conditions, they are among the most reinforcing benzodiazepines. Each causes a withdrawal syndrome, but alprazolam withdrawal may be more severe and may occur after a shorter period of use. Adverse effects from their use are said to be rare, yet subtle negative consequences may be seen with some regularity. Alprazolam deserves special caution because of its relative newness, great popularity, reinforcing capabilities, relatively severe withdrawal syndrome, and reports of addiction and negative consequences of use.\r"

Usage of benzodiazepines increased dramatically during the 1960s and early 1970s; tranquilizer but not hypnotic usage has since declined. Both abuse and misuse were documented early, but the incidence was deemed low in view of the widespread prescription. Normal-dose physical dependence was first suspected in the early 1970s but it was not until the early 1980s that scientific evidence was adduced to establish its reality and frequency. Further studies have revealed the complex nature of the withdrawal syndrome. A reaction has set in against these drugs, with attempts to limit them to short-term use.\r"

Of the 24 dual-diagnosis patients admitted to our Day Treatment Center in 1988, 57% left treatment at or before 8 weeks following admission, as opposed to 21% of a nonsubstance abusing psychiatric control group. Their rate of absenteeism and suspensions for continuing abuse and infraction of the rules was four times that of the controls. In light of these data, it appears that these patients require highly specialized treatment strategies not generally available in a conventional psychiatric day hospital.\r"

  ".W": "Cocaine abuse can cause cardiovascular damage leading to hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and infarction. This might be partly due to the effects of cocaine on the microcirculation about which little is known, although its effects on the macrovessels are well documented. Accordingly, we used in vivo videomicroscopy to study the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine on arterioles of different diameter. They were classified into three orders (A2, A3, A4) according to their position in the microvascular network and their diameter. Since calcium antagonists have been reported to exert a protective effect against the cardiovascular disorders induced by cocaine, we tested the hypothesis that this protective action occurs in the microcirculation. We found that intra-arterial administration of the calcium antagonist Nitrendipine greatly inhibited the vasoconstriction induced by cocaine in all three arteriole orders. The degree of inhibition ranged from 44 to 56%. Combined administration of benzodiazepine and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has also been reported to protect rats against cocaine-induced hypertension and to increase survival rates after a toxic dose of cocaine. Since the mechanisms of this protection are not yet clear, we also studied the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Enalaprilat on cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Intra-arterial administration of Enalaprilat inhibited this vasoconstriction slightly but significantly in arteriole orders 2 and 3 by 27 and 24% respectively, but not in order 4. We concluded that Nitrendipine is a powerful inhibitor of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in the microcirculation. The small but significant inhibition found with Enalaprilat for the larger arterioles suggests that the local angiotensin II level may affect the response to cocaine. However, since the Enalaprilat-induced inhibition was very limited, we conclude that mechanisms other than those occurring in the peripheral microcirculation account for the protection afforded by Enalaprilat against the harmful effects of cocaine.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic antidepressant overdose is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in self-poisoned patients. The major cause of mortality with cyclic antidepressant overdose is cardiotoxicity. We determined plasma catecholamine levels in 41 symptomatic acute overdose patients to identify interactions between QRS duration (a marker for cardiotoxicity) and a presumed hyper-adrenergic state. Using a linear multivariable regression analysis, QRS duration correlated with the presence of cyclic antidepressant, plasma norepinephrine levels, the ratio of norepinephrine to epinephrine level, and pulse rate (p less than 0.001, r2 = 0.42). Commensurate physiologic changes were not found in the presence of elevated catecholamine levels in the cyclic antidepressant overdose group. One possible explanation for the blunted systemic response to the elevated catecholamine levels is adrenergic desensitization. Investigation of serial catecholamine levels during cyclic antidepressant overdose may lead to modification of our current theories of cardiotoxicity and therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution has been recommended as an adjunct to traditional overdose management. Although combined activated charcoal and whole bowel irrigation could enhance the efficacy of both modalities, this improvement remains largely speculative. An in vitro experiment was designed to determine whether polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution alters the adsorption of theophylline to activated charcoal. Theophylline was agitated with activated charcoal in either water or polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution, at each of three activated charcoal:theophylline ratios; 1:1, 3:1, and 10:1. The concentration in the supernatant was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the maximal adsorptive capacity of activated charcoal for theophylline was calculated from the Langmuir equation. The percent of theophylline adsorbed by activated charcoal in water was 16 +/- 4%, 67 +/- 5%, and 97 +/- 3% for the 1:1, 3:1, and 10:1 ratios, respectively. This was decreased to 17 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 3%, and 62 +/- 2% when polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution was added. A statistical difference (p less than 0.05) occurred at the 3:1 and 10:1 activated charcoal:theophylline ratios. Similarly the maximal adsorptive capacity was decreased 23% from 264 mg/g to 203 mg/g when polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution was added to activated charcoal prior to theophylline. Polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution significantly decreases adsorption of theophylline to activated charcoal in vitro. In vivo studies are required to confirm these findings. If activated charcoal is to be used clinically for theophylline toxicity, the authors suggest the possibility of larger quantities of activated charcoal, and administering activated charcoal in a slurry of water before the initiation of whole bowel irrigation.\r"

  ".W": "One hour after suicidal ingestion of about 20 mL of a 38% solution of bromofosmethyl, CAS: 2104-96-3 (bromophos), a 52 year-old female was admitted to the hospital with extreme miosis, hypersalivation, hyperperistalsis and muscular fibrillation. Gastric lavage was performed and activated charcoal administered. Cholinergic symptoms were antagonized by repeated doses of 0.5 mg atropine. Because of the high dose of bromophos, hemoperfusion was performed with amberlite XAD4. The bromophos clearance during hemoperfusion was 95 mL/min (flow 200 mL/min). The patient received two doses of 500 mg obidoxime for recurrent muscular fibrillation. The further clinical course was uneventful. On day 4, the patient was transferred to a psychiatric ward because of persistent suicidality. In contrast to poisoning by most organophosphates, red blood cell acetyl cholinesterase was only minimally depressed but the plasma butyryl cholinesterase was initially decreased and normalized within a few days. The records of 25 patients reported to our Poison Control Center with ingestion of more than 1 g bromophos were also evaluated. The most frequent symptoms were miosis, hyperperistalsis, hypersalivation, agitation, nausea/vomiting and convulsions. Nine of the patients had no symptoms. Bromophos is relatively less toxic than its phosphate derivative, parathion.\r"
