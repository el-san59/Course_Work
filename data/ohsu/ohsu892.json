  ".W": "A hamster model of schistosomiasis has provided the first opportunity to sequentially examine the early phases of the development of portal hypertension in a natural model of chronic liver disease. Groups of hamsters were infected with 50 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni and underwent hemodynamic evaluation at intervals of 5, 8, 12 and 20 wk after infection. A progressive rise in intrahepatic resistance (from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 8.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg min.ml-1.gm liver weight [p less than 0.01]) appeared to play a major role in the initial stages of evolving portal hypertension. A gradual decline in portal blood flow (from 2.1 +/- 0.3 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 ml.min-1.gm-1 liver weight [p less than 0.01]) was only partially compensated for by an increase in hepatic arterial flow. Accordingly, by week 20, total hepatic blood flow decreased 23%. Liver weight that increased markedly between 5 and 12 wk after infection, as a result of the acute accumulation of obstructing granulomas, stabilized between wk 12 and 20, while a gradual but progressive rise in hepatic collagen content was seen. Portal pressure increased 75% during the study period. Chronic examination of this natural model should help define the pathogenesis of the complications of portal hypertension and contribute to the basis for effective intervention in this disease process.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a hormone with the physiological characteristics of a regulator of body fluid volume. It is potent, has a short duration of action, and responds to a physiologically relevant stimulus in a negative feedback-controlled system. It can act directly or indirectly (via inhibition of aldosterone biosynthesis) on the kidney to alter sodium transport and may regulate fluid distribution within the extracellular space. The peptide circulates at low (nanomolar) levels, and recent studies with renal inner medullary cells document relevant receptor binding and second messenger activation in this concentration range. In vivo data support a direct action on the kidney to enhance natriuresis, and blockade of a primary catabolic pathway for ANF within the kidney results in augmented natriuresis at concurrent endogenous peptide concentrations. Long-term, low dose infusion directly into the renal artery of conscious dogs supports a physiological action of ANF to promote urinary sodium excretion. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, natriuresis does not occur even at high circulating levels of ANF. Apparently other factors such as renal perfusion pressure, volume status, and renal nerve activity are important in determining the natriuretic response to a given level of peptide. We hypothesize that the role played by ANF in volume regulation is highly complex, and the kidney responds with increased sodium excretion only when a constellation of variables is appropriately arrayed. That is, ANF is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to induce natriuresis.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiocytes were exposed for 24 hours to culture media containing 0-2.0 mM extracellular calcium. Both atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) messenger RNA (mRNA) and ANF secretion were increased approximately threefold in the presence of 2.0 mM CaCl2 (vs. Ca2(+)-free medium). When cardiocytes were treated with the calcium channel blockers diltiazem, nifedipine, or verapamil, both ANF synthesis and secretion fell to 25-40% of control values. The choice of transcription start site on the ANF gene was not altered by the calcium channel blockers. When exogenous calcium was added to cardiocytes treated with verapamil, secretion of ANF was partially restored to control levels. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of medium from cardiocytes exposed to varying extracellular calcium concentrations or treated with calcium channel blockers for 24 hours revealed that the majority of secreted immunoreactivity (60-70%) migrated with pro-ANF (17 kDa) and that none of the various experimental manipulations significantly changed the ratio of pro-ANF to ANF in the media. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis of the culture medium from the individual treatment groups. Treatment of cardiocytes for 24 hours with either the calcium ionophore A23187 or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate increased ANF secretion. The combined use of these agents resulted in stimulation of both ANF secretion and ANF mRNA accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "Although much experimental evidence is consistent with the concept that atrial natriuretic factor (atriopeptin) is an important physiological regulator of renal sodium excretion, this hypothesis remains unproven. Indeed, a rapidly expanding collection of experimental data appears to be more compatible with the opposite conclusion, namely that circulating atriopeptin exerts only a trivial effect on renal sodium excretion during normal day-to-day living conditions. In this review, the substantial evidence demonstrating that elevations of plasma atriopeptin from threefold to 13-fold produce only a slowly developing and relatively modest natriuresis is reassessed in light of recently published data indicating that the acute intake of food (the pathway by which essentially all sodium enters the body under normal living conditions) does not increase circulating atriopeptin. These considerations imply that atriopeptin does not contribute to the process that elicits a postprandial natriuresis, a process that presumably is of primary importance in the physiological regulation of sodium balance. In addition, consideration is given to a number of common physiological, experimental, and pathophysiological conditions in which circulating atriopeptin does not correlate with renal sodium excretion. This lack of correlation implies that atriopeptin is not an important regulator of sodium excretion in these situations.\r"

In lymphocytes suspended in a more physiological HCO3/CO2-buffered solution, pHi was again lower in the adult SHR than in the WKY rat (7.18 +/- 0.02, n = 16 and 7.31 +/- 0.02, n = 16, respectively, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The responses to incremental infusion rates of 1, 5, 10, and 50 ng.kg-1.min-1 synthetic human ANF and to 1-2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 SNP were examined in the in situ autoperfused lung lobe of open-chest anesthetized pigs under conditions of normal and elevated pulmonary vascular tone. During basal conditions, ANF and SNP caused small but significant reductions in pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) with no change in lobar vascular resistance (LVR). When pulmonary vascular tone was increased by prostaglandin F2 alpha (20 micrograms/min), ANF infusion at doses greater than 1 ng.kg-1.min-1 decreased Ppa and LVR in a dose-related fashion. Infusion of 50 ng.kg-1.min-1 ANF and of 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 SNP maximally decreased Ppa, from 33 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and from 31 +/- 4 to 18 +/- 1 mmHg (P less than 0.001), respectively. At these doses, ANF reduced systemic arterial pressure by only 11.5 +/- 3% compared with 34 +/- 4% decreased with SNP (P less than 0.001). The results indicate that ANF, similarly to SNP, exerts a direct potent vasodilator activity in the porcine pulmonary vascular bed, which is dependent on the existing level of vasoconstrictor tone.\r"

Both sodium bicarbonate and Carbicarb resulted in systemic alkalinization and comparable increases in the serum bicarbonate at 50 min (7.07 +/- 0.91 vs. 7.99 +/- 0.77, respectively; P = NS). Sodium bicarbonate infusion resulted in an increase in CO2 excretion that accounted for a fractional CO2 excretion of 0.20 +/- 0.09, whereas infusion of a bicarbonate-carbonate mixture resulted in a fractional CO2 excretion of -0.06 +/- 0.09 (P less than 0.01). The uncorrected volume of distribution of bicarbonate after sodium bicarbonate infusion was higher than that seen with the bicarbonate-carbonate mixture (0.60 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.03 l/kg; P less than 0.01). However, when the volume of bicarbonate distribution was corrected for expired CO2, there was no difference between treatment with sodium bicarbonate and the bicarbonate-carbonate mixture (0.44 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.04 l/kg; P = NS). These data demonstrate that, in this animal model of acidosis, sodium bicarbonate treatment of systemic acidosis is accompanied by a generation of a considerable amount of CO2, whereas treatment with a bicarbonate-carbonate mixture is not. This suggests that in states of impaired ventilation, a bicarbonate-carbonate mixture may offer more efficient systemic alkalinization and may be associated with less CO2 generation than sodium bicarbonate.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine whether hypocapnia causes bronchoconstriction by releasing tachykinins (TKs) from C-afferent nerves in airways. Hypocapnia-induced bronchoconstriction (HIBC) was induced in anesthetized vagotomized guina pigs by ventilating lungs with a heated humidified hypocapnic gas mixture for 15 min after sudden circulatory arrest. The intensity of bronchoconstriction was assessed by calculating changes in dynamic compliance and by measuring the relaxation lung volume at the completion of experiments. Visualization of the airways by tantalum bronchography showed constriction of segmental bronchi with relative sparing of more proximal airways. Hypocapnia-induced bronchoconstriction was prevented by prior administration of salbutamol aerosol. Three experimental interventions were used to investigate the role of TKs in HIBC: 1) repeated capsaicin injections to deplete airway sensory nerves of TKs, 2) treatment with phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of enkephalinase, the main enzyme responsible for TK inactivation, and 3) topical airway anesthesia. Capsaicin pretreatment markedly attenuated the hypocapnia-induced changes in dynamic compliance (P less than 0.0005) and relaxation lung volume (P less than 0.0002), whereas phosphoramidon augmented these changes (P less than 0.02, P less than 0.03, respectively). Topical anesthesia of airways with lignocaine postponed the onset of bronchoconstriction, whereas the longer-acting, more lipid-soluble local anesthetic, bupivacaine, almost completely prevented HIBC. We conclude that, in the guinea pig lung, HIBC is mediated by TKs that are released after the activation of bronchial axonal reflexes.\r"

As expected, the increase in specific airway resistance from base line provoked by exercise was greater in the asthmatic subjects (from 11.8 +/- 7.1 to 34.0 +/- 18.6 l.cmH2O.l-1.s-1) than in the healthy subjects (from 3.7 +/- 1.2 to 4.5 +/- 1.9 l.cmH2O.l-1.s-1). In both groups, exercise was associated with a similar and significant rise in plasma IR-ANP levels, ranging from 222 to 550% from base-line value in the healthy group and from 176 to 1,120% from base-line value in the asthmatic group. Peak plasma IR-ANP levels occurred from 3 to 15 min after completion of exercise with a return to base-line values within 60 min. Although eucapnic hyperpnea was associated with a similar increase in specific airway resistance as was exercise, it provoked an increase in circulating IR-ANP in only one subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the contribution of vascular and metabolic stimuli to the sustained hyperpnea after exercise, the respiratory effects of obstructing and then releasing the femoral blood flow were recorded in 15 normal volunteers during recovery from steady-state cycle exercise (80 W). Obstruction was achieved using cuffs around the upper thighs, inflated for the first 2 min of recovery to a pressure of 200 mmHg. Cuff inflation significantly reduced ventilation during recovery compared with control (P less than 0.001); the subsequent release of pressure was accompanied by an increase in ventilation (averaging 3.2 l/min), which began on the first breath after release. This preceded a rise in end-tidal CO2 (maximum 8.3 Torr increase), which first became significant on the fourth breath after release and led to a further rise in ventilation. The first-breath increase in ventilation after cuff release persisted, although slightly attenuated (averaging 2.5 l/min), in additional experiments with inspired O2 fraction of 1.0. The pattern of ventilatory response was also similar when the experiments were performed with 5% CO2 in air as the inspirate. The immediate rise in ventilation on cuff release, together with the persistent response on 100% O2, suggests that the vascular changes resulting from cuff release exert an influence on ventilation independent of the effects of released metabolites on the known chemoreceptors. The persistence of the response on 5% CO2 indicates that CO2-sensitive lung afferents do not have a major role in these responses.\r"

Mean base-line PtCO2 and PtcCO2 were comparable in the two groups. UNDW in normal subjects produced no significant changes in mean PtcCO2 and PtCO2. In asthmatics, the UNDW-induced decrease in mean PtcCO2 was greater and longer lasting, accompanied by a prolonged decrease in mean PtCO2. PtcCO2 and PtCO2 trends showed highly significant differences compared with healthy volunteers (P less than 0.001). Arterial blood gas measurements validated these changes. UNDW in asymptomatic asthmatics gives rise to a greater and more prolonged hyperventilation than in normal subjects and to gas-exchange abnormalities presumably reflecting a ventilation-perfusion mismatching.\r"

We examined the effects of the use of an eight-millimeter solid alignment rod, with and without venting; an eight-millimeter fluted alignment rod, with venting; and an eight-millimeter fluted or solid alignment rod, inserted through a 12.7-millimeter drill-hole, but without other venting. A statistically significant reduction in oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), and end-tidal carbon-dioxide tension (PETCO2) occurred after insertion of both solid and fluted eight-millimeter alignment rods through an eight-millimeter hold in both vented and unvented femoral canals, in association with a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in intramedullary pressure. Bone-marrow contents and fat were retrieved from samples of blood from the right atrium, indicating that embolization of marrow contents had occurred during insertion of the alignment rod. A small decrease in systemic blood pressure and heart rate also occurred. These changes were completely eliminated by the use of a 12.7-millimeter drill-hole as the entry site of the eight-millimeter fluted rod. We concluded that insertion of an intramedullary alignment rod in the femur causes embolization of marrow contents, which decreases arterial oxygen tension, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon-dioxide tension, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The best results were in patients who had a cartilaginous coalition and who were less than sixteen years old at the time of operation.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that chronic infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) instituted before hypoxic exposure attenuates the development of pulmonary hypertension in hypoxia adapted rats, ANP (0.2 and 1.0 microgram/h) or vehicle was administered intravenously via osmotic minipump for 4 wk beginning before exposure to 10% O2 or to room air. Low dose ANP increased plasma ANP levels by only 60% of vehicle controls after 4 wk and significantly decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) (P less than 0.01), the ratio of right ventricular weight to body weight (RV/BW) (P less than 0.01), and the wall thickness of small (50-100 microns) pulmonary arteries (P = 0.01) in hypoxia-adapted rats. ANP did not alter any of these parameters in air-control rats. High dose ANP increased plasma ANP levels by 230% of control and produced greater reductions in MPAP (P less than 0.001) and RV/BW) (P less than 0.05), but not in pulmonary arterial wall thickness, than the low dose. Neither dose of ANP altered mean systemic arterial pressure in either hypoxic or normoxic rats. The data demonstrate that chronic infusion of exogenous ANP at a dose that does not affect MPAP or RV weight in air-control rats attenuates the development of pulmonary hypertension and RV enlargement in rats adapted to chronic hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Diets that reduce atherosclerosis risk lower levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), but the significance of this is unclear. To better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon we studied the turnover of HDL apolipoproteins A-I and A-II in 13 subjects on two contrasting metabolic diets. Upon changing from high to low intake of saturated fat and cholesterol the mean HDL-C decreased 29% from 56 +/- 13 (SD) to 40 +/- 10 mg/dl, while apo A-I levels fell 23% from 139 +/- 22 to 107 +/- 22 mg/dl (both P less than 0.001). Mean apo A-II levels did not change. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apo A-I increased 11% from 0.228 +/- 0.048 to 0.254 +/- 0.063 pools/d, while its absolute transport rate (TR) decreased 14% from 12.0 +/- 2.7 to 10.3 +/- 3.4 mg/kg per d (both P = 0.005). The decrease in HDL-C and apo A-I levels correlated with the decrease in apo A-I TR (r = 0.79 and 0.83, respectively; P less than 0.001), but not with the increase in apo A-I FCR (r = -0.04 and -0.02, respectively). In contrast, within each diet the HDL-C and apo A-I levels were inversely correlated with apo A-I FCR both on the high-fat (r = -0.85 and -0.77, P less than 0.001 and = 0.002, respectively) and low-fat diets (r = -0.67 and -0.48, P = 0.012 and 0.098, respectively) but not with apo A-I TR. In summary, diet-induced changes in HDL-C levels correlate with and may result from changes in apo A-I TR. In contrast, differences in HDL-C levels between people on a given diet correlate with and may result from differences in apo A-I FCR. Therefore, the mechanism of dietary effects on HDL levels differs substantially from the mechanism explaining the differences in levels between individuals on a fixed diet. In assessing coronary heart disease risk, it may be inappropriate to conclude that diet-induced decreases in HDL are equivalent to low HDL within a given diet.\r"

The observation that lipid accumulates in this and other patients with complex I deficiency suggests impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. To investigate this mechanism we have shown impaired flux through beta-oxidation [( U-14C]hexadecanoate oxidation was 66% of control rate) and accumulation of specific acyl-CoA ester intermediates.

  ".W": "IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression is induced by LPS (endotoxin) in monocytes/macrophages and in some monocytic cell lines. IFN gamma and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3) are important macrophage-activating factors. They induce changes in the human monocyte cell line U937 that reflect cellular differentiation. We have studied the effect of IFN-gamma and of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the expression of IL-1 and TNF-alpha messenger RNA in response to LPS. The induction of these genes by LPS is immediate and transient, with a maximum in 3 h. Preincubation of the cells with IFN-gamma or with 1,25(OH)2D3 increases these mRNA responses to LPS about fourfold. More importantly, cells exposed to IFN-gamma for 72 h exhibit a drastically different and unexpected pattern of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta gene response to LPS. Instead of the normal transient response, one then observes a sustained increase in IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta gene expression over at least 16 h after LPS stimulation. This was measured both at the level of mRNA and by direct transcription assays (run-off). This striking effect of IFN-gamma on the kinetics of IL-1 gene response does not apply to the TNF-alpha gene. Interestingly, 1,25(OH)2D3, which shares with IFN-gamma a number of important effects on monocytes/macrophages, does not affect the kinetics of IL-1 gene response to LPS. In view of the biological relevance of endotoxin as a macrophage activator, the potential clinical implication of this prolonged induction of IL-1 gene expression is discussed.\r"

Phagocytosis of unopsonized Hc yeasts by monocyte-derived M phi and human alveolar M phi (AM) was rapid. After 60 min, 79% of cultured M phi and 59% of AM had ingested an average of 9.8 and 11 yeasts/M phi, respectively. In contrast, only 26% of monocytes ingested 4.5 yeasts/cell after 60 min. Phagocytosis of unopsonized microconidia by cultured M phi and by AM was equivalent. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha-chains and beta-chain of the CD18 family of adhesion receptors inhibited the binding of Hc yeasts and microconidia to cultured M phi and AM. Thus, the M phi CD18 complex mediates recognition of both phases of this dimorphic fungus. Disruption of actin microfilaments with cytochalasin D inhibited both attachment and ingestion of yeasts by M phi. In contrast, nocodazole, which prevents polymerization of microtubules, did not inhibit binding or ingestion. Both drugs inhibited ingestion, but neither drug inhibited binding of C3b- and C3bi-coated sheep erythrocytes to complement receptors type one (CR1) or type three (CR3), respectively. Therefore, different signal transducing mechanisms for phagocytosis appear to be triggered by the binding of Hc yeasts to CD18, and by the binding of EC3bi to CD11b/CD18, respectively.\r"

Because (a) NPY has been shown to be colocalized with noradrenaline in peripheral as well as central catecholaminergic neurons, and (b) alpha 2-adrenergic receptors of adipocytes play a major role in the regulation of lipolysis, we investigated the effect of NPY and PYY on isolated fat cells. In human fat cells NPY and PYY promoted a dose-dependent inhibition of lipolysis elicited by 2 micrograms/ml adenosine deaminase (removal of adenosine) whatever the lipolytic index used (glycerol or nonesterified fatty acids). In dog fat cells NPY and PYY inhibited adenosine deaminase-, isoproterenol- and forskolin-induced lipolysis. In humans and dogs the effects of NPY or PYY were abolished by treatment of cells with Bordetella pertussis toxin, clearly indicating the involvement of a Gi protein in the antilipolytic effects. This study indicates that, in addition to alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, NPY and PYY are also involved in the regulation of lipolysis in human and dog adipose tissue as powerful antilipolytic agents. Further studies are needed to characterize the pharmacological nature of the receptor mediating the inhibitory effect of NPY and PYY in fat cells.\r"

  ".W": "To study the proliferative response of hematopoietic cells to growth factors at the molecular level, we developed a cell-free system for growth factor-dependent initiation of genomic DNA replication. Nuclei were isolated from the IL-3-dependent cell line NFS/N1-H7 after a 10-h period of IL-3 deprivation. Cytosolic and membrane-containing subcellular fractions were prepared from proliferating NFS/N1-H7 cells. Nuclei from the nonproliferating cells (+/- IL-3) showed essentially no incorporation of [3H]thymidine during a 16-h incubation with a mixture of unlabeled GTP, ATP, UTP, CTP, dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and [3H]dTTP. When the combination of IL-3, a cytosolic fraction, and a membrane-containing fraction from proliferating cells was added to nuclei from nonproliferating cells, a burst of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA began after a 12-h lag period, attained a maximal rate at 16 h, and reached a level of 860 pmol thymidine/10(6) nuclei at 24 h (corresponding to replication of approximately 56% total mouse genomic DNA). This DNA synthesis was inhibited approximately 90% by the specific DNA polymerase alpha inhibitor aphidicolin. Deletion of a single cellular component or IL-3 from the system resulted in a marked reduction of DNA replication (-membrane, 80 +/- 4%; -cytosol, 90% +/- 4%; -IL-3, 74 +/- 7% inhibition). This model requires a growth factor (IL-3), a sedimentable cell fraction containing its receptor and possibly additional membrane-associated components, and a cytosolic fraction. It appears to recapitulate the molecular events required for progression from early G1 to S phase of the cell cycle induced by IL-3 binding to its receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Several common pulmonary disorders characterized by mucus hypersecretion and airway obstruction may relate to increased levels of inhaled or endogenously generated oxidants (O2 metabolites) in the respiratory tract. We found that O2 metabolites stimulated release of high-molecular-weight glycoconjugates (HMG) by respiratory epithelial cells in vitro through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid. Noncytolytic concentrations of chemically generated O2 metabolites (purine + xanthine oxidase) stimulated HMG release by cell and explant cultures of rodent airway epithelium, an effect which is inhibitable by coaddition of specific O2 metabolite scavengers or inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. Addition of O2 metabolites to epithelial cells provoked production of PGF2a, an effect also inhibitable by coaddition of O2 metabolite scavengers or inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. Finally, addition of exogenous PGF2a to cell cultures stimulated HMG release. We conclude that O2 metabolites increase release of respiratory HMG through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid with production mainly of PGF2a. This mechanism may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of a variety of lung diseases associated with hypersecretion of mucus and/or other epithelial fluids, as well as a basic cellular response to increased oxidants.\r"

We obtained a murine mAb produced against an IL-2-dependent human T cell clone defining a novel molecule sTA which is not expressed on resting human peripheral blood CD3+ cells but strongly expressed on a fraction of TCR-gamma delta-bearing clones. Like receptors for growth factors such as IL-2, the sTA Ag is present on clones and cell lines according on the cell cycle. SDS-PAGE analysis of sTA immunoprecipitates from 125I-labeled sTA+ clone lysate demonstrated a single band of molecular mass 110 kDa under reducing conditions. Triggering with anti-sTA mAb did not result in [Ca2+]i mobilization of sTA+ clones. Additionally, the presence of anti-sTA did not alter the cytotoxicity of these sTA+ clones neither against tumor target cells nor against specific PHA blast cells. Interestingly, due to the fact that most sTA+ clones fail to proliferate in response to CD3 triggering, it appears that sTA may serve as a useful marker to study the functional heterogeneity of TCR-gamma delta expressing cells.\r"

Increased uptake of [3H]thymidine could be detected within 36 h in vitro and its presence in astrocytes was confirmed by autoradiography. In contrast, neither IL-1 alpha nor IL-1 beta induced astrocyte proliferation in serum-free medium but showed some synergistic effect with serum after 72 h. The proliferative effect of TNF and IL-6 was confirmed by cell counting. None of the cytokines tested was toxic for astrocytes as measured by 51Cr release. No mitogenic effect for oligodendroglia, purified from the same source, was detected.

  ".W": "In the present study we have demonstrated that the murine IL-1 alpha precursor lacks a cleavable signal sequence and does not undergo cotranslational translocation across microsomal membranes in vitro. Culture supernatants of the murine macrophage cell line, P388D, or from normal peritoneal macrophages collected within 0.5 to 3 h after stimulation contained the 33,000 m.w. precursor as the predominant form of IL-1 alpha. Over an 18-h period, the level of low m.w. IL-1 alpha increased as the secreted precursor was processed by extracellular and/or cell surface-associated proteolytic enzymes. The calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin were found to dramatically enhance the release and processing of murine and human IL-1. The rapid release of IL-1 in response to a change in the intracellular level of calcium does not appear to be caused by release of a membrane-bound form of the protein, nor is there evidence that IL-1 is packaged and released from cytoskeletal associated secretory granules. In marked contrast, calcium ionophores do not induce secretion of IL-1 from a nonmacrophage cell line that synthesizes but does not normally secrete IL-1. Our results suggest that activated macrophages possess a novel processing independent, possibly calcium-dependent, mechanism that allows for the release of the precursor forms of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta.\r"

These activities suggest that CRP might interact with monocytes/macrophages via specific receptors in a manner analogous to the interaction of IgG with FcR. With the use of radio-labeled human CRP, we have observed specific binding of CRP to human blood monocytes and the human monocytic cell line U-937. Binding was saturable at a pathophysiologic concentration of CRP, with an estimated KD of 9.5 x 10(-8) M and 3.6 x 10(5) binding sites/cell. Specific binding was inhibited by polyclonal human IgG as well as an IgG1 myeloma. In the converse experiment, CRP failed to inhibit specific [125I]IgG binding. The mAb IV.3, which inhibits binding of IgG immune complexes to FcRII, did not inhibit CRP binding. A 100-fold excess of phosphorylcholine or the phosphorylcholine binding peptide of CRP (residues 47-63) failed to inhibit binding. Although human rIFN-gamma and PMA increased FcRI expression, these reagents had no affect on CRP receptor expression. A single membrane protein of 38 to 41 kDa from U-937 cells was chemically cross-linked to [125I]CRP; the cross-linking was inhibited by human IgG1 but not the IV.3 mAb. Furthermore, two membrane proteins with a Mr of 38 to 40 kDa and 58 to 60 kDa were isolated by CRP ligand-affinity chromatography. These proteins were of a distinct size from those isolated for FcRI from an IgG ligand matrix. These studies demonstrate specific binding of human CRP to a human monocytic cell line via receptors that are distinct from the IgG FcR and implicate CRP in nonspecific, preimmune host defense reaction mediated by cells of the monocytic lineage.\r"

  ".W": "As reported by other workers, the treatment of rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells with dexamethasone resulted in a marked decrease in responsiveness to Ag-stimulation. All responses measured, which included hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, increase in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+, release of arachidonic acid and the secretion of serotonin, were suppressed, but once the cells were permeabilized the inhibitory actions of dexamethasone were no longer apparent. This suggested that all the necessary components of the stimulatory cascade were intact in the dexamethasone-treated cells. The measurement of phospholipase C activity in cell extracts and studies with phorbol ester also indicated that the cells contained a normal complement of phospholipase C and protein kinase C activity. We had previously shown that both Ag and the adenosine analog, 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)-adenosine, can activate phospholipase C, but they do so through different G proteins. Interestingly, the activation of phospholipase C by 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)-adenosine and the ensuing stimulatory events were markedly enhanced in dexamethasone-treated cells. The treatment with dexamethasone thus did not result in direct suppression of effector systems, but instead resulted in the selective modulation of the coupling between receptors and the effector systems by mechanisms that require soluble cytosolic factors.\r"

All three agents suppressed the proliferation of splenic T cells triggered by lectins or antibodies to CD3 and Ly-6C. FK-506 or CsA also inhibited proliferation, IL-2 production, and IL-2R expression in splenic T cells activated with ionomycin + PMA. However, RAP minimally affected IL-2 production and IL-2R expression in these cells, although it reduced proliferation. Similarly, FK-506 and CsA, but not RAP, suppressed IL-2 production by activated DO.11.10 T hybridoma cells. In such a system, as well as in normal T cells stimulated with high ionomycin concentrations, FK-506 and CsA enhanced proliferation, indicating that they both abrogate negative signals associated with T cell activation. On the contrary, RAP diminished the autonomous proliferation of hybridoma cells, whereas FK-506 and CsA had little effect. The proliferative response induced in D10.G4 cells by IL-1 + ionomycin but not that induced by IL-1 + PMA was sensitive to inhibition by FK-506 and CsA. In contrast, RAP inhibited equally well both types of stimulation. Finally, T cell proliferation driven by IL-2 or IL-4 was found to be relatively resistant to FK-506 or CsA but sensitive to RAP. Altogether, these data demonstrate that FK-506 and CsA alter similar calcium-associated events of T cell activation and block T cell proliferation primarily by suppressing lymphokine production. RAP interferes with a different set of events and inhibits T cells by impairing their response to growth-promoting lymphokines.\r"

Metabolism of endogenous and exogenous AA by cultured m phi obtained from the peritoneum (PM), the pulmonary interstitium (IM), and the alveolar spaces (AM) was examined by using HPLC and RIA. Although PM and AM released similar amounts of endogenous AA in response to both ionophore A23187 and the particulate zymosan, PM metabolized AA predominantly to cyclooxygenase (CO) products, whereas AM produced predominantly 5-lypoxygenase (5-LO) metabolites. IM synthesized a profile of eicosanoids which more closely resembled that of PM. Studies of the metabolism of exogenously supplied AA demonstrated that AM indeed had less CO activity than did PM. PM, but not AM, CO activity decreased during prolonged culture in air, suggesting the possibility that oxidative inactivation of CO plays a role in the decline in CO capacity which accompanies m phi differentiation in the lung. In contrast, the greater expression of 5-LO metabolism in AM than PM did not reflect mere differences in enzyme capacity, since upon activation of protein kinase C with PMA or oleoylacetylglycerol, ionophore-stimulated PM produced amounts of 5-LO products which were comparable to the amounts produced by AM stimulated with A23187 alone. These results indicate that increases in 5-LO metabolism and decreases in CO metabolism accompany rat m phi differentiation in the lung, that these changes occur largely in the alveolar space, and that the increased 5-LO capacity and decreased CO capacity are independently regulated by different mechanisms.\r"

All of the clones tested responded to cells infected with the immunizing (Muguga) as well as heterologous stocks of T. parva, indicating that the T cells are specific for an Ag shared by several geographically diverse parasites. The response was apparently MHC-restricted, and induced by Ag expressed on the infected cell surface. In the presence of autologous APC, the clones were also stimulated by a soluble high speed supernatant (HSS), but not by a schizont membrane-enriched, subcellular fraction prepared from homogenates of infected cells. The clones produced IFN-gamma and T cell growth factor in response to HSS. The soluble Ag was absent in cells from which schizonts had been eliminated by treatment with the anti-theilerial drug, parvaquone. Fractionation of HSS by hydroxylapatite chromatography revealed two antigenic peaks that separated from the majority of the protein. Fractionation of HSS by gel filtration with the use of HPLC revealed several peaks of activity ranging in Mr from 270 kDa to less than 5 kDa. Further fractionation of HSS by both hydroxylapatite chromatography and gel filtration yielded three major peaks of activity (Mr 43, 12, 4.2 kDa). We conclude that a T cell-dependent schizont-associated soluble Ag is also expressed on the surface of T. parva-infected cells.\r"

This antileishmanial activity was suppressed in a dose dependent fashion by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMLA), a competitive inhibitor of nitrite, nitrate, nitric oxide and L-citrulline synthesis from L-arginine. Excess L-arginine added to infected macrophage cultures reversed the inhibitory effects of NGMMLA. Addition of arginase to culture media inhibited intracellular killing by IFN-gamma-treated cells. Similar effects were seen with macrophages obtained from BCG-infected C3H/HeN mice. Increased levels of nitrite, an oxidative product of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism, was measured in cultures of infected IFN gamma-treated macrophages as well as infected BCG-activated macrophages. Nitrite production correlated with development of antileishmanial activity. Nitrite production and microbicidal activity both decreased when in vivo or in vitro-activated macrophages were cultured in the presence of either arginase or NGMMLA. Nitric oxide synthesized from a terminal guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine and a precursor of the nitrite measured, may disrupt Fe-dependent enzymatic pathways vital to the survival of amastigotes within macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A (CsA) blocks production of IL-2 by lymphocytes in vitro, and impairs immune responses in vivo. During infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), IL-2 is produced by spleen lymphocytes with a time course corresponding to that of T cell activation and proliferation, but distinct from NK cell activation and proliferation. To evaluate the requirement for IL-2 in supporting lymphocyte proliferation in vivo, and to investigate the mechanisms of CsA-induced immunosuppression, the effects of CsA on LCMV-elicited responses were examined. CsA had profound effects on lymphocyte expansion and CTL activation on day 7 postinfection, the peak of the T cell response to LCMV. Proliferation of both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets was affected. Inhibition of T cell expansion was accompanied by the inhibition of IL-2 production and IL-2 responsiveness. In situ hybridization revealed a 50% reduction in the percentage of cells transcribing IL-2, suggesting that CsA blocked IL-2 production at the level of gene transcription. Transcripts of the gene for the IL-2R p55 chain are also normally elevated during infection, and CsA treatment resulted in an 80% reduction in the percentage of cells transcribing this gene. A reduced responsiveness of freshly isolated cells to rIL-2 in vitro correlated with the reduction of IL-2 receptor gene transcription positive cells. In contrast to effects of the drug on T cells, the level of NK cell activation was not decreased as a result of CsA treatment. These observations suggest that the IL-2 produced by lymphocytes in vivo in response to virus infection is required to promote the T cell response to LCMV, but do not support a role for IL-2 in NK cell activation under the conditions examined. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the profound inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation induced by CsA treatment during an in vivo immune response.\r"

The dose response of IL-2 was biphasic. The addition of MC from cord blood did not enhance IL-2-mediated survival. Because the effect of IL-2 alone, or IL-2 plus MC, was ablated by anti-IFN-gamma and human neonates have an IFN-gamma production defect, the protective effect of MC plus human IFN-gamma (HuIFN-gamma) was tested. MC from adults cultured for 5 days in HuIFN-gamma afforded protection. At least 1 x 10(6) HuIFN-gamma-treated MC were required with increasing survival to 1 x 10(7) MC. The effector cell activity was ablated by adherence, silica, L-leucine methyl ester treatment or treatment with Leu-M3 plus C (all macrophage markers), and OKT4 plus C treatment (CD4 marker). Use of Leu-11, Leu-7, OKT3, or OKT8 plus C did not inhibit protection and excluded NK or T cell participation. In addition to survival, the ability to produce anti-HSV antibody was reconstituted. For the first time protection was afforded by human cord blood MC after treatment with HuIFN in vitro. We have identified an IFN-gamma-driven protection system against murine neonatal HSV infection mediated by human adult- or cord blood-derived CD4-positive macrophages. Protection is associated with enhanced effector cell function and reconstitution of the neonatal antibody production defect.\r"

Conditioned medium from cultures of granulomas from euthymic mice stimulated fibroblast proliferation, chemotaxis, and synthesis of collagen, collagenase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, and hyaluronate, whereas those prepared from cultures of granulomas isolated from athymic mice were relatively or absolutely deficient in such activities. These observations provide a correlation between the presence of fibrosis in vivo and the production of fibrogenic factors and reinforce our hypothesis that granuloma-derived fibrogenic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest a central role of T lymphocytes in the fibrogenic process.\r"

In both cell lines, the 3' part of the V exon was markedly abnormal and contained several stop codons. Point mutations affected the JH6 donor splice site in the JBL2 gene, precluding normal splicing into C mu. Although the JH2 splice site was unmodified in Ly91, it was not used. As in JBL2, splicing occurred at an alternate splice site present 5' of these alterations, thus removing all these abnormalities from the mature transcripts.

On a theoretical basis, the absence of D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments in this strain should result in a 70% reduction of the diversity of the TCR repertoire. To experimentally assess the effects of this deletion, we bred the NZW TCR beta-chain allele onto a BALB/c background and tested the ability of this new congenic strain to respond to a panel of 22 random Ag. T cells from BALB/c.beta NZW mice responded to all 22 Ag tested but the magnitude of the response to a large proportion of these Ag (11 of 22) was markedly reduced when compared with T cells from BALB/c mice. Responses to the remaining Ag were either comparable (9 of 22) or occasionally even enhanced (2 of 22) compared with BALB/c mice. In addition, we found that the frequency of V beta 6- and V beta 8.1-bearing T cells was increased by approximately 20% in BALB/c.beta NZW mice. These results suggest that D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments are required to maintain a diverse T cell repertoire and that their deletion from the genome may confer a significant selective disadvantage in the wild.\r"

  ".W": "The precursors of murine lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) can be divided into two major subsets: NK-like (CD8-, NK1.1+, asialo GM1+) and T-like (CD8+, NK1.1-, asialo GM1+). LAK effectors have generally been characterized as being either CD8+ or NK1.1+. In this study, we divided each of these effector subsets further by virtue of their expression of B220 (as defined by the mAb 6B2) and Ly-24 (Pgp-1). Freshly obtained CD8+ and NK1.1+ cells were found, by fluorescence analysis, to be B220-. Lytically active LAK effector subsets were either CD8+ B220+ Ly-24+ or NK1.1+ B220+ Ly-24+. Most interestingly, a distinct NK1.1+ B220- Ly-24+ subset existed but had minimal lytic activity, suggesting that only a subset of NK cells is capable of acquiring the broad lytic activity of LAK. The acquisition of the B220 marker by the CD8+ subset closely paralleled its expression of lytic activity. However, classical MHC-restricted CD8+ CTL were Ly-24+ but remained B220- suggesting that the acquisition of the B220 marker, as defined by the 6B2 mAb, is not merely the result of cellular differentiation but may serve as a marker of MHC-nonrestricted killers. Three \"classes\" of target cells were examined for their susceptibility to lysis by the LAK effector subsets: YAC-1 (NK sensitive), CL27A (NK resistant), and autologous lymphoblasts that have been modified with 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. YAC-1 was lysed exclusively by the NK1.1+ B220+ Ly-24+ subset, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-self was lysed exclusively by the CD8+ B220+ Ly-24+ subset whereas CL27A was lysed by both subsets. This pattern of lysis was confirmed by the in vivo depletion of NK1.1+ cells. It, therefore, appears that LAK effector subsets may be more selective in their lytic repertoire than previously thought.\r"

  ".W": "Secretory heterohybrid clones from seven pristine human B cell lymphomas of diverse histologic types were established to investigate the question of tumor clonal diversity. We found that in six tumors, heterohybrid-derived Ig showed similar band patterns in IEF; families of anti-Id prepared from tumor Ig reacted uniformly with individual heterohybrids and original tumor; and the V gene loci displayed little variation on Southern analysis. In one patient who was followed with serial multiple site biopsies over a 14-mo period, clonal Id was preserved until the final stage of his disease, in spite of cytotoxic treatment. In a single follicular tumor (J.M.), each of the anti-Id reacted uniformly with the parent tumor and the individual heterohybrids, except that three of six clones failed to react with a single anti-Id family member. A Southern analysis of the VH gene locus revealed an identical gene rearrangement that was shared by the parent tumor and each heterohybrid. However, there was considerable heterogeneity of J.M. heterohybrid Ig in IEF gels, and we demonstrated the production of variant lambda L chains by the heterohybrid clones. One type of lambda L chain had a normal mobility in SDS-PAGE gels but larger lambda variants were produced by four of six heterohybrids. A Southern analysis of the VL gene displayed considerable variation in the type of lambda rearrangement present in the various heterohybrids, suggesting extensive diversity at the VL gene locus. In a second tumor (S.C.) that exhibited uniform anti-Id tumor reactivity we were also able to demonstrate the presence of a second minor tumor cell population (a biclonal tumor). Our data suggest that intraclonal VH variation may vary considerably with lymphoma subtype and mutagenic exposure and that an additional mechanism for generating spontaneous intraclonal heterogeneity is genetic variation at the VL locus.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported previously that spleen cells from (SJL x PL) F1 hybrid mice are not tolerant to SJL parental cells as assessed by a one-way MLR. The possibility that the F1 anti-SJL reaction was due to the effect of lymphokines produced by the irradiated SJL T cells in response to I-Eu expressed on the F1 hybrid cells was eliminated since inclusion of anti-I-E mAb was without effect. Cell separations showed the responder cells to be plastic and nylon wool nonadherent Ia- T cells. Separation of the SJL spleen cells showed that the stimulator cells were nonadherent, passed through a nylon wool column, and were Ia-. the F1-anti-SJL MLR was blocked 70 to 90% by inclusion of mAb KJ23a in the culture medium that indicated that the stimulatory cell population was V beta 17a+ T cells. This was confirmed by the use of V beta 17a+ and V beta 17a-T cell clones as stimulators. To determine whether failure to develop tolerance to this T cell subset in F1 hybrid mice might be responsible for the F1-anti-parent MLR, (SJL x PL)F1 mice were treated at birth and 48 h thereafter with anti-I-E mAb for 7 wk. Spleen cells from antibody-treated F1 mice were nonreactive with irradiated SJL parental cells in contrast to spleen cells from control mice which indicated that V beta 17a+ T cells were eliminated by negative selection before the development of tolerance.\r"

  ".U": "90111043\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has suggested that the generative lineage within the human thymus can be defined by the selective expression of CD45 isoforms and is CD45RO- and predominantly CD45RA+. In order to physically localize these cells we have stained frozen sections of human thymus with antibodies to CD45RO (p180), and CD45RA (p205/P220), as well as with CD1 and HLA class I to define cortical and medullary areas, respectively. In the cortex, 70 to 90% of thymocytes were CD45RO+, whereas only 0.5% expressed CD45RA. Medullary cells were 30% CD45RO+, 29% CD45RA+; approximately 40% did not express detectable levels of either isoform but did express CD45 common determinants. To assess the degree of proliferation of cells expressing CD45 isoforms, we stained adjacent sections, or used double staining, with Ki67, an antibody that detects a nuclear Ag on proliferating cells. We found that CD45RA+ thymocytes are predominantly a resting medullary population with a small component in cell cycle, consistent with our analysis of human thymocytes by immunofluorescence, and with data in murine systems defining the generative lineage. To confirm that the CD1- or low, CD45RO-CD45RA+ thymocytes defined by immunofluorescence analysis were likely to have a medullary location, we analyzed the CD4/CD8 subset distribution of CD1-cells. From 80 to 90% of CD1-thymocytes are CD4+ or CD8+ single positives or CD-8- double negatives. CD1-thymocytes also include 12 to 14% CD4+8+ cells with a probable medullary location. A similar analysis of lymphocytes expressing a high density of HLA class I, which have a medullary location, confirmed the existence of CD4+8+ thymocytes in the medulla. Purified CD3-4-8- cells, previously shown to be CD1-CD45RA+, were also shown to bear a high density of HLA class I, indicating a medullary location. Correlative localization of a panel of Ag thus supports the argument for a medullary location of the thymic generative lineage.\r"

  ".U": "90111046\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that both IFN-gamma and IFN-beta are produced in vivo and in vitro by spleen cells obtained from mice experiencing a chronic form of graft vs host disease (GVHD). Further, we have shown that in vitro production of IFN-beta by spleen cells from GVHD mice may play a role in the suppressed in vitro mitogen responsiveness of these cells. This study was undertaken to investigate if treatment of such mice with mAb to IFN-gamma or IFN-beta could alter the immunosuppression or lymphoid hypoplasia associated with chronic GVHD. GVHD was induced across minor histocompatibilities by the i.v. injection of B10.D2 spleen cells into sublethally irradiated BALB/c mice. These mice were given daily injections for 20 days of one of the following: 1) mAb to IFN-gamma, 2) mAb to IFN-beta, or 3) control IgG. Histologic examination of these mice at 21 to 22 days post transplantation revealed that mice treated with mAb to IFN-beta or control IgG had dramatic hypoplasia of the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes which was similar to untreated GVHD mice. Mice given mAb to IFN-gamma, however, had no lymphoid hypoplasia and had a near normal gross and histologic appearance of their thymus, spleen, and lymph node tissue when compared with syngeneic controls. In vitro mitogen-induced proliferative responses of spleen and lymph node cells obtained from GVHD mice or GVHD mice treated with mAb to IFN-beta were severely suppressed or absent. In contrast, spleen and lymph node cells from GVHD mice given mAb to IFN-gamma were capable of giving a significant in vitro proliferative response to Con A, PHA, and LPS. Further, natural suppressor cell activity and spontaneous production of IFN-beta, a characteristic of this form of GVHD, was absent in spleen cells obtained from GVHD mice treated with mAb to IFN-gamma. These results further identify the IFN as playing critical roles in the pathogenesis of GVHD.\r"

  ".U": "90111050\r", 
  ".W": "Mycoplasma arthritidis T cell mitogen (MAM), in association with its MHC ligand, is recognized by T cells that express TCR-alpha/beta assembled with a product(s) of the V beta 8 gene family. We show here that lymphocytes from mice which fail to express V beta 8 products can also be activated by MAM and the resulting cultures exhibit a marked increase in V beta 6 TCR-bearing cells. Evidence was also obtained that MAM can activate T cells that express all three V beta 8 TCR. The mAb, F23.1, which recognizes all V beta 8 gene products, was strongly inhibitory for MAM-induced proliferation of CBA cells whose T cell repertoire for MAM consists of T cells that express V beta 8.2 and 8.3 TCR. In contrast, the F23.1 mAb was only weakly inhibitory for BALB/c splenocytes which express V beta 6 TCR in addition to all three V beta 8 TCR. Involvement of V beta 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and V beta 6 in MAM-induced proliferation was confirmed by expanding lymphocyte cultures in the presence of MAM and phenotyping the activated cells for expression of individual V beta TCR. There was also evidence for a selective activation of T cells bearing specific V beta TCR because BALB/c T cell populations expanded with MAM were comprised of 46.2% V beta 8.2+ cells, 18.6% V beta 8.1+ cells, 7.6% V beta 8.3+ cells and 6.7% V beta 6+ cells. Recent studies suggest that the newly described \"superantigens\" including the staphylococcal enterotoxins and the self minor lymphocyte-stimulating Ag activate T cells in a manner similar to that described earlier for MAM. The discovery of shared recognition of these proteins by specific V beta TCR strongly suggests that MAM belongs to the superantigen protein family, the members of which may share cross-reactive epitopes. Inasmuch as MAM is produced by an organism which induces chronic joint disease, our findings provide the basis for a new model to study the role of superantigens in the development of chronic autoimmune type diseases.\r"

Anti-Ig-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis, elevations in [Ca2+]i, and induction of DNA synthesis were inhibited by PMA (a phorbol ester) as previously reported. In contrast, indolactam (an alkaloid PKC activator) inhibited PIP2 hydrolysis and elevations in [Ca2+]i, but stimulated rather than inhibited cellular proliferation. In order to examine whether the binding avidity of the PKC activators to PKC played a role in determining their activity to stimulate or inhibit B cell activation, we studied two other PKC activators, bryostatin and mezerein. Again, both inhibited anti-Ig mediated PIP2 hydrolysis and elevations in [Ca2+]i, whereas only the former inhibited induction of DNA synthesis. These data suggest that a) high levels of PIP2 hydrolysis and elevations in [Ca2+]i are not essential for anti-Ig-mediated induction of B cell DNA synthesis and b) activation of PKC may induce both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways of B cell activation, and whether stimulation or inhibition of cell activation is observed may depend on the combined intensity of these two signals.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of the staphylococcal enterotoxins to stimulate all T cells bearing certain (but not all) TCR has generated a great deal of interest. This stimulation appears to involve specific binding of the toxin to class II Ags and subsequent stimulation via the TCR. Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induces multiple T suppressor cell populations that inhibit both primary and secondary plaque-forming cell responses. Efforts to characterize these suppressor cell populations have demonstrated that the suppressor population active early in the antibody response expresses the Lyt-1-2+ cell surface phenotype, whereas depletion analysis suggests that the population active late in an ongoing response bears the Lyt-1+2+ cell-surface markers. In the present study, enrichment for this late acting effector population with the use of sequential panning with anti-Lyt mAb reveals significant suppressive activity at both the initiation and effector phases of a 5-day Mishell-Dutton coculture. Additional experiments using I-J disparate strains of mice have demonstrated a genetic restriction at the \"I-J\" gene locus between the cells mediating SEB-induced suppression and their target. Depletion of SEB-primed splenocytes with anti-I-J mAb suggests that both the early and late effector cells bear I-J molecules on their surface. Taken together, these results show that SEB induces suppressor cell populations with properties similar to those exhibited by Ag-specific cell circuits.\r"

The spleen cells from nude mice grafted with AKR/J thymus showed a significantly decreased level of primary cytotoxic T cell response when stimulated with AKR/J cells, although these cells lysed well target cells of a third party C57BL/6 when stimulated with C57BL/6 cells. Consistent with CTL responses, T cells bearing V beta 6, that is important for recognizing M1s1a-encoded products of the thymic phenotype, were virtually abolished in the spleen and lymph node cells of nude mice 8 wk after grafting with AKR/J thymus. However, a substantial number of V beta 6-bearing T cells were detected in the peripheral organs of nude mice 23 wk after grafting with AKR/J thymus and in those of nude mice grafted with AKR/J fetal thymus depleted of macrophages/dendritic cells by incubating with 2'-deoxyguanosine in vitro before grafting. On the other hand, T cells bearing V beta 3, which are selectively related to M1s2a-encoded products of the host phenotype, were expressed neither on the peripheral T cells of nude mice grafted with AKR/J thymus at any stage after grafting nor on those of nude mice grafted with 2'-deoxyguanosine-treated AKR/J thymus. These data suggested that both V beta 6 and V beta 3 T cells were eliminated in the thymus of nude mice grafted with AKR/J thymus, presumably on the basis of interaction with both of graft-derived persisting and host-derived hemopoietic cells in the thymus and that thymic epithelium appears to have little capacity to eliminate T cells reactive to minor lymphocyte stimulating-encoded products.\r"

  ".U": "90111058\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to simulate purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency by preincubating with guanosine (Guo) to minimize PNP activity while investigating the metabolism of [14C] deoxyguanosine (dGuo) at physiologic concentrations (10 microM) by unstimulated thymocytes, tonsil-derived T and B lymphocytes, and peripheral blood cells over short time periods. GTP was the principal metabolite formed from dGuo by all cell types with functional PNP and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, confirming formation via degradation to guanine with subsequent salvage by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Thymocytes also formed a small amount of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), presumably through direct phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase. Incorporation of dGuo into GTP was effectively inhibited in all instances under PNP deficiency conditions and dGTP levels increased up to 10-fold in thymocytes, but tonsil-derived B or T lymphocytes and unfractionated PBL still accumulated no detectable dGTP. E and platelets formed low amounts of dGTP under these conditions. Preincubation with adenine (50 microM) to reverse any Guo-induced toxicity reduced the incorporation of dGuo into GTP without inhibitor in all cell types with intact adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, but had no effect on dGTP accumulation in thymocytes, with or without inhibitor, thus excluding any indirect formation of dGTP via the de novo route. The rapid metabolism of dGuo to GTP, in the absence of PNP inhibition and subsequent effects of the altered GTP concentrations on cellular metabolism, may account for the differing responses reported by investigators with the use of low dGuo concentrations (enhancing), compared with high (inhibitory), concentrations in mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte studies. The exclusive ability of thymocytes to accumulate significant amounts of dGTP, and inability of B cells to do so, provides a logical explanation for the selective T cell immunodeficiency in PNP deficiency.\r"

In the thymuses of adult mice, gamma delta+ thymocytes were scattered throughout cortical and medullary areas of the thymus and most concentrated in the subcapsular areas of the thymus. Ultrastructural immunohistochemistry confirmed the close association between medullary thymic epithelial cells and gamma delta+ thymocytes in the neonatal thymus and also showed that some TCR-gamma delta molecules were patched to areas of contact with medullary epithelial cells. In contrast to the cellular distribution of either CD3 molecules or the TCR-alpha beta, where extensive intracellular labeling of thymocytes has been observed, cytoplasmic accumulation of delta-chain was not detected.\r"

  ".U": "90111060\r", 
  ".W": "IL-6 is a regulator of inflammatory and immunological processes and high levels of this cytokine have recently been shown to be present in synovial fluids from inflammatory and degenerative arthropathies. Synovial fluid IL-6 may in part be a product of synoviocytes that have previously been identified as a source of IL-6. To further define intraarticular sources of IL-6, we examined the ability of chondrocytes to produce IL-6 and studied its modulation by inflammatory cytokines and homeostatic regulators of chondrocyte function. Human articular chondrocytes isolated from normal and osteoarthritic joints released low levels of IL-6 when cultured in the presence of serum. The inflammatory cytokines IL-1, and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma increased IL-6 production. Among the growth factors known to act on chondrocytes, only transforming growth factor-beta, but not epidermal growth factor. fibroblast growth factor, insulin growth factor-1 and 2, platelet growth factor or insulin, was able to significantly increase IL-6 synthesis. Analysis of hormonal influences on chondrocyte IL-6 production showed that testosterone and estradiol synergized with IL-1 in the induction of IL-6. Hydrocortisone, at 10 ng/ml, reduced IL-1-induced IL-6 production by more than 50%. Chondrocyte-derived IL-6 stimulated acute phase protein synthesis and hybridoma cell proliferation. These biological activities were neutralized by a specific antibody to IL-6. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies showed that IL-1 induced de novo synthesis of IL-6 and that the IL-6 proteins secreted by chondrocytes were similar to those from fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that chondrocytes are able to produce IL-6 in response to physiologic and inflammatory stimuli. Chondrocytes probably contribute to the increased synovial fluid levels of IL-6 in inflammatory and degenerative conditions of cartilage, and IL-6 may serve as a mediator to coordinate responses to cartilage injury.\r"

  ".W": "mAb were used in an immunocytochemical assay to examine beta 2-microglobulin (b2-m) and class I MHC expression in human neuroblastoma cell lines. In lines with weak class I expression among the whole population, under ordinary assay conditions, strong b2-m and class I expression were concentrated in a small subpopulation. In positive cells, Ag was not restricted to any part of the cell body or processes. Strong expression was not required for establishment of any morphologic form or any type of cell contact. These findings complement studies in other experimental systems, where a nonimmunologic role for class I or b2-m in neural cell growth was not revealed. When the microscopic assay was modified to reveal Ag within the internal membrane system, b2-m was detected in every neuroblastoma cell. Most often, the Ag appeared as a ring around the nucleus, or in a punctate distribution in the juxtanuclear area. Internal expression of HLA chains and class I molecules was more difficult to detect, possibly reflecting a normal excess of b2-m. These findings increase understanding of MHC regulation in neural cell lines. They provide the technical and conceptual background for examination of internal MHC Ag in neural tissue.\r"

This interaction occurs in lymphoid tissues and inflammatory sites at post-capillary high endothelial venules, as opposed to large capacitance vessels lined with flat EC. Transient SV40 infection of mouse EC derived from lymph node stroma has resulted in a cell line, SVEC4-10, that retains morphological and functional characteristics of normal EC. SVEC4-10 cells grow efficiently on plastic as a monolayer with a characteristic epithelioid morphology. They require as little as 2% FCS and are independent of other exogenous growth factors or matrix components. When grown on a synthetic basement membrane, SVEC4-10 forms branching tube-like networks. SVEC4-10 expresses Factor VIII related Ag as measured by indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit antiserum to human FVIII-associated protein and incorporates acetylated low density lipoprotein. SVEC4-10 specifically binds mouse lymphocytes in vitro. IFN-gamma induces expression of MHC class II Ag in a time course identical to normal EC and the cell line is susceptible to lysis by anti SV40 H-2k CTL clones. Thus, this SV40 immortalized line retains much of the normal cellular physiology of EC.\r"

  ".U": "90111067\r", 
  ".W": "We have demonstrated recently that rIFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of murine bone marrow cells stimulated with rIL-3 or recombinant granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF. In light of this finding, three murine CD8+ CTL clones whose supernatants had been shown previously not to contain detectable levels of CSF activity but which contained a relatively high level of IFN-gamma were reassessed for their ability to secrete IL-3 and GM-CSF. Supernatants from CTL clones activated with anti-CD3 mAb failed to stimulate the IL-3-dependent cell line FDCP1. However, these supernatants were indeed able to stimulate the proliferation of FDCP1 cells if anti-IFN-gamma mAb was present. This stimulatory activity was specifically neutralized by anti-IL-3 mAb. Supernatants from two of the three clones stimulated the proliferation of a GM-CSF-responsive HT-2 cell line, and this activity was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antibody. The otherwise modest ability of CTL supernatants to stimulate the proliferation of fresh bone marrow cells was augmented considerably in the presence of anti-IFN-gamma mAb, and this activity was appropriately blocked by anti-IL-3 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. mRNA for IL-3 and GM-CSF, as well as for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, was detected in cells that secreted those lymphokines, and the time course of appearance of each mRNA correlated with secretion of the appropriate lymphokine activity. However, the time course of mRNA accumulation for each lymphokine was distinct, the order of expression of these genes apparently being TNF-alpha, then IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, and finally IL-3. Our results emphasize that potential interactions among lymphokines must be considered when interpreting data obtained from lymphokine bioassays and suggest an immunoregulatory role for CTL through the secretion of several of the same lymphokines produced by HTL.\r"

The secretion of IFN-gamma is vigorously triggered in MLC. Thus, IL-4-stimulated MLC represent a suitable model to characterize the functional antagonism between IL-4 and IFN-gamma. In this report, we show that rIL-4 consistently induced IgE synthesis when added to human primary MLC. IL-4-dependent IgE production required cognate T/B cell recognition, because it was inhibited by antibodies to CD3 and MHC class II (HlA-DR) Ag. A neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma mAb dramatically enhanced IL-4-dependent IgE synthesis by MLC, indicating that endogenous IFN-gamma is a major inhibitor of IgE production. More importantly, addition of rIL-4 markedly inhibited the release of IFN-gamma in supernatants of MLC and Con A-activated PBMC. The decrease in IFN-gamma protein was accompanied by a decreased expression of IFN-gamma mRNA transcripts. The downregulation of IFN-gamma by IL-4 is likely to play an important role in the IL-4-dependent induction of IgE synthesis.\r"

From a panel of antibodies that react specifically with permeabilized T lymphocytes but not with permeabilized B lymphocytes or native T cells, we have selected one, designated TIA-1, that reacts with 20 to 36% of digitonin permeabilized peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of purified CD4+ and CD8+ subsets showed TIA-1 to recognize a subpopulation of 49 to 64% of CD8+ lymphocytes. Little or no reactivity with CD4+ resting T lymphocytes was observed. TIA-1 did not react with any of a panel of T cell lines, B cell lines, or monocytoid cell lines. TIA-1 reacted strongly with NK cell clones and CD8+ cytolytic T cell clones, and less strongly with CD4+-activated T cell clones, suggesting a preferential expression in cells possessing cytolytic potential. Cell fractionation experiments showed TIA-1 to be membrane associated. Furthermore, Percoll gradient fractionation of a cytolytic T cell clone (T4T8C1) showed the majority of TIA-1 to be contained in a low density membrane fraction that also contained serine protease activity. Immunoelectron microscopy showed TIA-1 to decorate the membranes of electron lucent and electron dense cytoplasmic granules in this same cytolytic T cell clone. Biochemical analysis showed TIA-1 to be a 15-kDa protein in unstimulated T cells. Upon activation with Con A or anti-CD3 antibodies. TIA-1 was induced to form disulfide linked dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the basic 15-kDa unit. Taken together, our data suggest that TIA-1 is a cytolytic granule associated protein that may define a subpopulation of resting CD8+ T lymphocytes possessing cytolytic potential.\r"

  ".U": "90111073\r", 
  ".W": "A number of cell-surface proteins are anchored by a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-glycan moiety. These proteins can be released by PI-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLC). Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is such a cell-surface protein that protects cells from inadvertent complement attack by binding to and inactivating C3 and C5 convertases. We have studied the regulation of DAF synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), a cell that has the highest level of surface DAF among those human cells that have been studied. HUVEC DAF was measured by immunoradiometric assay of detergent extracts and of cell supernatants after treatment of cells with a bacterial (Bacillus thuringiensis) PI-PLC. Eighty percent of the HUVEC DAF (4 to 8 x 10(5) molecules/cell) was released by exogenously added PI-PLC, indicating that it is predominantly PI-anchored. The level of PI-PLC-sensitive HUVEC DAF was increased three- to fourfold by overnight treatment of cultures with the protein kinase C activators, PMA (1 to 10 nM), phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (10 to 100 nM), and teleocidin A (1 to 10 nM) under conditions where cell number, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase remain unchanged. This DAF synthesis was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor K-252a in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = 0.06 microM). The biologically inactive phorbols, 4-alpha-phorbol-12 myristate-13-acetate (1 microM) and 4-alpha-phorbol-12, 13-didecanoate (1 microM) did not increase DAF levels. The newly expressed DAF in PMA-stimulated cells was still largely PI-anchored. In contrast, another PI-anchored protein, alkaline phosphatase, was not altered by PMA treatment, demonstrating that the PMA effect is not uniform among all surface proteins. The increased expression of DAF only was evident 8 h after PMA addition and was blocked by the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that both transcription and translation are required for DAF synthesis induced by phorbol esters. It is concluded that protein kinase C activators cause selective induction of endothelial cell DAF and that DAF synthesis involves protein kinase C activation.\r"

A48 RI+ mAb derived from idiotypically manipulated mice molecularly resembled the A48 and UPC 10 prototypes of this system by utilizing a VHX24-Vk10 combination. Id expression by these antibodies was not restricted by a particular D region sequence, JH, or JK segment, but quantitative differences in Id expression were associated with utilization of different members of the VK10 germ-line gene families. The VL sequences of these A48 RI+ mAb has identified amino acid residues lying in four different idiotope-determining regions which may contribute to the structural correlate of this Id. A comparative sequence analysis of the VH regions of these VHX24 utilizing A48 RI+ mAb with several A48 RI+ mAb utilizing VHJ558 or VH7183 VH genes as well as a hybrid transfectoma antibody derived from two A48 RI-, VHJ558 utilizing hybridomas, all suggested that four nonconsecutive positions which lie outside the idiotope-determining regions may contribute structural elements toward expression of this Id. The VH and VL regions of the A48RI+, VHX24-Vk 10+ mAb showed low to moderate levels of somatic mutation which showed different patterns of distribution between the complementary determining region (CDR) and framework regions in the H and L chains. Although the VK sequences contained 50% of the replacement mutations in the CDR, with a replacement/silent mutation ratio of 10, the CDR of the VH sequences contained only 31% of the replacement mutations with a replacement/silent mutation ratio of 0.69.\r"

  ".U": "90111078\r", 
  ".W": "The activation of mononuclear phagocytes (M phi) and their generation of oxidative products is influenced by various cytokines as well as by normal maturational changes. We examined the effects of IL-4 on superoxide (O2-) production (cytochrome c reduction) by cultured M phi and the modulation of these effects by IFN-gamma and IL-1. Incubation of IL-4 (200 U/ml) with M phi inhibited M phi PMA (100 ng/ml)-stimulated O2-. production by 23% at 24 h, 34% at 48 h, and 70 to 85% at 72 to 96 h. IL-4 similarly inhibited M phi O2-. production in response to zymosan. IL-4 did not affect M phi viability, adherence to microtiter plates, or ability to phagocytose boiled yeast. In comparison with M phi, neutrophil O2-. production was not inhibited after 4 to 20 h incubation with IL-4. When IL-4 was washed out as early as 1 h after the initiation of M phi culture, significant inhibition of O2-. production was observed 4 days later. Sequential addition of either IL-4 or IFN-gamma to cultures demonstrated reciprocal cytokine effects on M phi; IL-4 partially inhibited O2-. production by M phi previously treated with rIFN-gamma whereas rIFN-gamma partially augmented O2-. production by M phi previously treated with IL-4. Because IL-4 has been reported to inhibit IL-1 production, add-back experiments were performed; addition of IL-1 only partly reconstituted O2-. production in IL-4-treated cells. Further characterization showed that although M phi protein synthesis was enhanced by both rIFN-gamma and IL-4 treatment, acid phosphatase, a marker of maturation to the macrophage phenotype, was markedly increased at an earlier time point in IL-4-treated M phi, and correlated with a decline in O2-. production. The ability of IL-4 to suppress M phi O2-. production implicates IL-4 as an important regulator of this aspect of the inflammatory response.\r"

Purified normodense eosinophils were incubated with cytokines (including rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-3, rIL-4, rIL-5, rIL-6, IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage CSF stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and TNF) for 1 to 3 h after which Ig-coupled Sepharose 4B beads were added as targets and the mixtures were incubated with the eosinophils at 37 degrees C for 4 h. The Ig used were secretory IgA (sIgA), serum IgA and IgG, and myeloma IgA and IgG. The release of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) was measured by RIA as an index of degranulation. rIL-5 was the most potent enhancer of Ig-induced degranulation and increased EDN release by 48% for sIgA and 136% for IgG. The effect of rIL-5 appeared as quickly as 15 min after incubation of eosinophils, sIgA beads and IL-5. GM-CSF and rIL-3 also enhanced Ig-induced EDN release but less potently than rIL-5. GM-CSF and rIL-5 by themselves induced a small but significant release of EDN from eosinophils in the absence of Ig-coated beads; rIL-3 did not. However, IFN-gamma suppressed sIgA-induced EDN release by 23%. The other cytokines did not have any effect on eosinophil degranulation. These results suggest that cytokines which induce eosinophil differentiation and proliferation during hematopoiesis also enhance the effector function of mature eosinophils and that IFN-gamma partially down-regulates eosinophil degranulation.\r"

Antibodies specific to IFN-gamma were affinity purified both from sera taken from healthy individuals and sera from viral-infected patients, by using a rIFN-gamma-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column. The antibodies were found to be of the IgG class, and maintained their ability to bind rIFN-gamma. They were then tested for neutralizing activity and none of the IgG preparations we analyzed impaired the antiviral activity of rIFN-gamma.

The effect of rIL-2 on cyclosporin A-treated cells was also tested. Whereas the Con A-induced proliferation of bovine lymph node cells was completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, the continuous growth of T. parva-infected cells was only partly inhibited. In both cases the inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in the level of IL-2R/Tac mRNA and surface IL-2R expression. The cyclosporin A-mediated inhibition of Con-A stimulated lymphoblasts was, over a period of 5 days, largely abrogated by human rIL-2. In the short term, rIL-2 could also alleviate the growth inhibition of T. parva-infected cells caused by treatment with cyclosporin A. In the long term, however, rIL-2 enhanced the cyclosporin A-mediated inhibition of T. parva-infected cells, gradually leading to their complete growth arrest. This enhanced inhibition was accompanied by a further reduction in surface IL-2R expression, but not by a further decrease in the levels of steady state IL-2R/Tac mRNA. The fact that IL-2 can enhance the inhibition caused by cyclosporin A could be of relevance for the immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporin A.\r"

Both the resistant C57BL/6J and the highly susceptible C3H/HeSnJ developed higher parasitemias and increased or earlier mortality when depleted of CD8+ T cells before infection with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi. CD8 depletion also affected the induction and expression of immunity to T. cruzi after vaccination with the avirulent Corpus Christi strain of T. cruzi. C57BL/6J mice depleted of CD8+ T cells either before or after vaccination showed a near total loss of vaccine induced protection. C3H mice were only partially protected by the vaccination procedure but the protection was totally reversed by anti-CD8 treatment. Chronically infected mice that had survived the acute infection were unaffected by CD8 depletion and showed neither a recrudescence of parasitemia nor an increased susceptibility to reinfection. These results suggest that CD8+ T cells play a role in immunity to T. cruzi in the acute phase but possibly not during the chronic phase of infection. Also, immunization with Corpus Christi strain T. cruzi induces an immunity that is distinct from that induced by survival of the acute phase of infection. The mechanism by which CD8+ T cells contribute to control of T. cruzi infection is not known. However, CD8 depletion had no effect on suppressed immune responses, suggesting their function in T. cruzi-infected mice is related more to the cytotoxic activity or cytokine-producing capacity of this subpopulation of T cells.\r"

We now report identification of a region 500-bp 5' of the human IFN-gamma TATAA box that has strong, PMA-inducible, enhancer-like activity when linked to a reporter gene (CAT) and transfected into a murine T cell line. However, when the same region of IFN-gamma genomic DNA was introduced into NIH-3T3 cells, no enhancer activity was detected either in the presence or absence of PMA. We have further found that an intronic region of the IFN-gamma genomic DNA (nucleotides 405-674) also contains enhancer activity that is functional in either fibroblasts or T cells. Enhancer activity of the intronic region is also PMA-inducible in the mouse T cells but constitutive in fibroblasts. Collectively, our observations suggest that control of human IFN-gamma gene expression is complex, involving noncontiguous regulatory domains in both 5' flanking and intronic regions of that gene.\r"

Recently, the expression of lck gene, one of the src family gene, has also been shown to be modulated during T cell activation. We, therefore, assessed the question of whether other src family genes are expressed during the activation of T cells and of whether cyclosporine, a potent immunosuppressive drug, affects expression of these genes. We examined the expression of four different src family genes (lck, c-src, fyn, and c-fgr) in addition to the expression of IL-2, c-fos, c-myc, and actin genes in murine T cells which were activated with PMA plus ionomycin or PMA plus anti-CD3 mAb. We found that T cell activation was associated with the up-regulation of these src family genes and that the expression of these genes was specifically blocked in the presence of cyclosporine indicating that these activation-related genes were coordinately regulated.\r"

  ".W": "A group of CD5(Ly-1) B cell lymphomas are described. They were derived from mice which received a common pool of syngeneic mouse spleen cells. Southern blot analysis revealed that the lymphomas exhibited an unusual set of Ig gene rearrangements. Six lymphomas analyzed had either of two rearrangement patterns. EcoRI restriction digests of tumor DNA probed for rearrangements in the JH region, resulted in restriction fragments of 4.7 and 5.6 kb or of 4.7 and 8.5 kb. Each had an identical HindIII restriction fragment identified when probed for kappa gene rearrangements. Inasmuch as several B cell lymphomas from mice receiving a common pool of spleen cells had identical kappa-rearrangements and one identical IgH rearrangement, it was important to determine the DNA sequence of expressed IgH and kappa-genes. Each tumor was found to have identical nucleotide sequences of VH-DH-JH and VK-JK. The nonproductive IgH rearrangements each consisted of incomplete DH-JH rearrangements. The 8.5-kb EcoRI fragment was generated from a DFL16 gene segment rearranged into JH3, and the 5.6-kb fragment was generated from DQ52 rearranged into JH)1. We conclude that these Ly-1 B tumors are most likely derived from a single clone of cells which underwent a secondary rearrangement on the nonproductive allele after kappa-rearrangement had occurred. The alternate possibility of independently arising lymphomas with identical expressed VH and VK sequences is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90111100\r", 
  ".W": "Macrophage activation for tumor cell killing is a multistep pathway in which responsive macrophages interact sequentially with priming and triggering stimuli in the acquisition of full tumoricidal activity. A number of mediators have been identified which have activating capability, including in particular IFN-gamma and bacterial LPS. Although the synergistic functional response of normal macrophages to sequential incubation with these activation signals has been well-established, characterization of the intermediate stages in the activation pathway has been difficult. We have developed a model system for examination of various aspects of macrophage activation, through the use of the murine macrophage tumor cell line, RAW 264.7. These cells, like normal macrophages, exhibit a strict requirement for interaction with both IFN-gamma and LPS in the development of tumor cytolytic activity. In addition, these cells can be stably primed by the administration of gamma-radiation. In the studies reported here, we have used RAW 264.7 cells treated with IFN-gamma alone or with IFN-gamma plus LPS to stimulate the production of rat mAb probes recognizing cell surface changes occurring during the activation process. In this way we have identified three Ag associated with intermediate stages of the activation process. One Ag, TM-1, is expressed on RAW 264.7 cells primed by IFN-gamma or gamma-radiation. This surface Ag thus identifies cells at the primed cell intermediate stage of the tumoricidal activation pathway regardless of the mechanism of activation. A second Ag, TM-2, is expressed on IFN-treated RAW 264.7 cells but not on RAW 264.7 cells primed with gamma-radiation alone. Expression of this Ag can be induced by treatment of irradiated cells with IFN-gamma, but is not induced by IFN-gamma treatment of a noncytolytic cell line, WEHI-3. This Ag thus appears to be an IFN-inducible cell surface protein associated specifically with macrophage activation for tumoricidal activity. Finally, Ag TM-3 is detectable on RAW 264.7 cells primed by either IFN-gamma or gamma-radiation, after subsequent triggering of the primed cells with LPS. The addition of the mAb recognizing this antigen to the function assay of tumor cell killing can inhibit they lytic activity of both triggered cells. Thus, this Ag may play a role in the antitumor effector functions of activated macrophages. Overall, the results suggest that these mAb can serve as useful tools for identification of molecules associated with the process of macrophage activation for tumor cell killing.\r"

From rat serum we now have isolated and purified a galactose-specific lectin by affinity chromatography. Comparative analysis of this serum galactose-binding protein with the galactose-particle receptor protein purified from rat liver macrophages and with C-reactive protein (CRP) reveals close relation or identity of these proteins. An apparent m.w. of 30,000 was determined for all three proteins by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and m.w. of about 130,000 by native PAGE. All three proteins exhibit the same pentameric, ring-shaped structure in electron microscopy after negative staining. Antibodies raised against the serum galactose-binding protein or against the macrophage receptor cross-react. A mAb specific for rat neo-CRP labels liver macrophages but not hepatocytes and reacts with the isolated protein in a Western blot assay. Furthermore, the galactose-particle receptor can be functionally replaced by purified CRP: the binding capacity for neuraminidase-treated E of receptor-depleted liver macrophages can be restored by preincubation with purified rat CRP. We therefore conclude that CRP occurs as a membrane-associated protein constitutively expressed on liver macrophages functioning as a receptor mediating galactose-specific binding of particulate ligands.\r"

The mAb2 performed as a molecular mimic of Ps as evidenced by 1) blocking of mAb1/mAb2 interaction by Ps, 2) blocking of mAb1/Ps binding by mAb2, 3) cross-species binding of mAb2 to human Ps antibodies from individuals immunized with the same immunotype 1 Ps, and 4) induction of anti-LPS antibody by immunization with mAb2 in syngeneic mice. Our studies thus show that an anti-idiotypic antibody may functionally mimic the O-polysaccharide of P. aeruginosa LPS, and bind to cross-reactive Id present in human Ps antibodies. We have further shown that this anti-idiotypic antibody induces anti-LPS antibody when used as an Ag in syngeneic mice, suggesting that this approach may eventually be used to successfully immunize humans.\r"

Four hours after instillation of 1.0 and 10.0 nmol of IL-1, the lavage samples consisted of 96.3 +/- 0.8% and 91.0 +/- 5.7% neutrophils, respectively. Alveolar neutrophils elicited with rbIL-1 beta and challenged with the calcium ionophore, A23187, released similar amounts of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and its nonenzymatic isomer LTB I, and significantly greater amounts of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and the nonenzymatic isomer LTB II, when compared with circulating neutrophils. The rbIL-1 beta did not, by itself, stimulate release of arachidonate metabolites from circulating neutrophils in quantities that were detectable by HPLC. Circulating neutrophils, preincubated with rbIL-1 beta and stimulated with A23187, released significantly greater amounts of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and total 5-lipoxygenase metabolites when compared with control cells not incubated with rbIL-1 beta. Incubation of circulating neutrophils with rbIL-1 beta and A23187 concurrently resulted in a significantly increased release of all 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonate. However, both the release of superoxide anion and bacterial killing by rbIL-1 beta-elicited bovine alveolar neutrophils did not differ from the values obtained for circulating neutrophils.\r"

Groups of weanling male rats were fed a diet containing 0.8% protein (PCM) or 24% protein (control). A third group (pair fed) was fed limited amounts of the control diet that matched the mean daily dietary intake of the PCM group. After 4 wk on the diets, alveolar macrophages from all three groups functioned similarly with respect to surface adherence, phagocytosis and killing of Listeria monocytogenes, release of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, and production of IL-1 and TNF. In contrast, Listeria-stimulated alveolar macrophages from the PCM group exhibited a marked shift in arachidonic acid metabolism, with impaired production of leukotriene B4 and enhanced release of thromboxane B2 and PGE2. The membrane arachidonic acid content and the uptake of [3H]arachidonate by alveolar macrophages did not differ among the three groups. The shift toward the cyclooxygenase pathway was not seen after 2 wk of dietary restriction and was reversed if PCM animals were fed the control diet for 1 wk. Thus, PCM does not affect the antimicrobial activity or cytokine production of alveolar macrophages, but causes alterations in arachidonic acid metabolism that may interfere with the modulatory functions of alveolar macrophages.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that immunity to the blood stage infection may be related to enhanced levels of class I MHC Ag on the parasitized reticulocyte surface and can be adoptively transferred to immunodeficient mice by immune CD8+ T cells in the absence of CD4+ T cells. To further examine the mechanisms of CD8+ T cell involvement in immunity to blood stage P. yoelii infection, we performed in vivo CD8 depletion and adoptive transfer experiments. Depletion of CD8+ T cells during primary blood stage infection in BALB/c mice did not diminish the ability of the mice to resolve their infections. Spleen cells from immune BALB/c and C57BL/10 mice were transferred to BALB/c-nu/nu and C57BL/10-nu/nu mice, respectively. The recipient mice were CD4 depleted in vivo to kill any transferred CD4+ T cells. The mice failed to control the infection. Populations of CD4-, CD8+ T cells were transferred from immune CBA/CaJ donors to in vivo CD4-depleted CBA/CaJ recipients. The mice were unable to control the infection. Although immune unfractionated spleen cells transferred rapid protection in all three mouse strains and immune CD4+ T cells transferred immunity in the two mouse strains studied, CD8+ T cells by themselves were neither protective nor did they enhance immunity.\r"

Evidence is presented that the teratocarcinoma Tera-2 stem cells express trace amounts of non-beta 2 microglobulin-associated classical HLA-A, -B, and -C Ag on their cell surface. The Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma cells derived from fetal trophoblast express normal levels of surface beta 2 microglobulin associated with 45-kDa and 41-kDa H chains that display unique isoelectric points in IEF gels. The HLA-6.0 or HLA-E genes may encode the lower molecular mass component on Jeg-3 cells, because these genes express molecules of about 38 kDa and 41 kDa, respectively, when transfected to appropriate host cells. Transcripts homologous to the HLA-6.0 gene are found to be constitutively expressed in the Jeg-3 cells but not in Tera-2 cells, whereas HLA-E is not significantly transcribed in either cell line. Transcription of class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and class I-like (HLA-E and HLA-6.0) genes is up-regulated after treatment with IFN-gamma in Tera-2 cells, whereas the corresponding genes in Jeg-3 cells remain essentially unresponsive. The biologic role of trophoblast class I(-like) molecules in the context of the maternal acceptance of the fetal semiallograft is discussed.\r"

In an effort to examine the molecular mechanism responsible for these V alpha-J alpha replacements, the structures of TCR-alpha cDNA prepared from both the parental and subcloned T cell lines have been determined. Here we report that: 1) the mechanism whereby the secondary rearrangements occur is a precise deletion event that involves germ-line V alpha genes 5' to the preexisting V alpha-J alpha complex joining to J alpha segments 3' of the preexisting complex deleting the region in between, 2) preexisting productive V alpha-J alpha rearrangements of the parental line do not allelically exclude productive and nonproductive secondary rearrangements, 3) both productively rearranged TCR-alpha alleles of the parental cell line can undergo secondary rearrangements, 4) the presence of unrearranged germline V alpha transcripts in the parental line support an \"accessibility\" model of regulated lymphocyte receptor gene rearrangement. In addition, we present data which suggests that one of the subcloned lines has undergone a third rearrangement of one of its TCR-alpha alleles. One interpretation of these results is that T cells may have the ability to circumvent allelic exclusion at the TCR-alpha locus early in their ontogeny. This could provide T cells with an additional mechanism for generating an Ag receptor repertoire which is not found in B cells.\r"

The presence of the conserved TCR beta-chain decanucleotide motif, an AP-1 consensus sequence and an inverted repeat in the deleted region, suggests their role as targets for transacting factors regulating transcription of the beta chain gene. Sequences between -343 and -85 increase transcription from the -85 fragment in T cells. The promoter is active in both T cells and fibroblasts. The enhancer was capable of enhancing TCR V beta 2 promoter activity in both T cells and fibroblasts. Sequences further upstream of the V beta 2 promoter down regulate V beta 2 promoter activity in the absence of the enhancer but its repressive influence is overcome in the presence of the TCR beta-chain enhancer.\r"

V delta 2 is typically used together with V gamma 2 on human peripheral blood gamma delta T lymphocytes. To examine whether V delta 2 can be used in conjunction with distinct V gamma segments, a TCR- mutant of the human gamma delta T cell line MOLT-13, which expresses parental TCR gamma (V gamma 1.3) but not TCR-delta protein, was transfected with plasmids containing full-length TCR-delta cDNA using either V delta 2 or V delta 3. TCR reconstitution was successful in both transfectants and resulted in TCR protein and RNA levels similar to that of the parental MOLT-13 cell line.

These studies imply that physical constraints cannot explain the observed chain pairing preferences. Other possible explanations are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the evolutionary pressures that drive the generation of polymorphism in primate MHC class I molecules, three cDNA that encode MHC class I alleles from a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), were cloned and sequenced. These tamarin MHC class I alleles contained amino acid substitutions not found in any of the previously sequenced human MHC class I alleles. Moreover, the majority of these unique amino acid substitutions was located in the Ag recognition site at positions that have been shown to be critical in the presentation of viral peptides to T cells in mice and humans. These data suggest that selective pressures on MHC class I molecules preferentially act on the Ag recognition site and that the peptide binding or presenting functions of these molecules may drive the generation of MHC class I polymorphism. The novel Ag recognition sites of the tamarin MHC class I molecules, in addition to their restricted polymorphism, might account for the unusual susceptibility of the cotton-top tamarin to human pathogens.\r"

The results show that V beta 5.1 is expressed predominantly by CD8+ T cells in mice of several MHC haplotypes. This finding suggests that V beta 5.1 may confer restriction to class 1 molecules present in these strains. Interestingly, however, T cells expressing V beta 5.1, like those expressing V beta 17a and V beta 11, are clonally deleted from both CD4 and CD8 subsets in mice that express MHC IE molecules. The latter result implies that V beta 5.1 confers reactivity to a class 2 molecule (IE). These results are discussed in terms of positive selection and clonal deletion. Finally we provide evidence that genes in the K or A regions of the MHC also control V beta 5.1 usage.\r"

Moreover, some mice (25%) at 2 mo after split-dose irradiation had already developed thymic lymphomas in their thymuses. To characterize these thymic prelymphoma cells, the thymocytes from B10 Thy-1.1 mice 1 mo after irradiation were stained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAb and were sorted into four subpopulations. These fractionated cells were injected into the recipient thymuses to examine which subpopulation contained thymic prelymphoma cells. The results indicated that thymic prelymphoma cells existed mainly in CD4- CD8- and CD4- CD8+ thymocyte subpopulations and also in CD4+ CD8+ subpopulation. T cell lymphomas derived from CD4- CD8- prelymphoma cells had mainly CD4- CD8- or CD4- CD8+ phenotypes. T cell lymphomas developed from CD4- CD8+ prelymphoma cells mainly expressed CD4- CD8+ or CD4+ CD8+ phenotype. T cell lymphomas originating from CD4+ CD8+ prelymphoma cells were mainly CD4+ CD8+ but some CD4- CD8+ or CD4+ CD8- cells were also present. These thymic prelymphoma cells were further characterized phenotypically in relation to their expression of the marker defined by the mAb against J11d marker and TL-2 (thymus-leukemia) Ag, which is not expressed on normal thymocytes of B10.Thy-1.2 or B10.Thy-1.1 strain, but appears on the thymocytes of lymphomagenic irradiated mice. The results indicated that the prelymphoma cells existed in J11d+, TL-2+ cells.\r"

  ".U": "90111135\r", 
  ".W": "A novel class of cell surface proteins are attached to the plasma membrane via a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-glycan anchoring structure, and these proteins can be selectively removed from the cell surface by the enzyme PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Enzyme treatment led to a prolonged reduction in cell surface expression of several PI-anchored proteins. Activation of T cells led to a marked decrease in the ability of PI-PLC to remove PI-anchored surface proteins from the activated T cells. This decrease in PI-PLC sensitivity may reflect an alteration in the PI-glycan anchoring structures, or in a general membrane property, which renders the PI-anchored proteins inaccessible to the enzyme. When murine T lymphocytes were treated with PI-PLC and then stimulated with either Con A, the calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA, or an anti-CD3 mAb, the response to Con A stimulation was inhibited by 90%, whereas the responses to ionophore and PMA or anti-CD3 were not affected. Removal of PI-anchored proteins inhibited an early event in the activation process in response to Con A because both IL-2 production and IL-2R expression were inhibited by the PI-PLC treatment. Inhibition of the Con A response was secondary to removal of a PI-linked protein from the responder T cell population because PI-PLC treatment of T-depleted spleen cells did not alter their ability to act as a source of accessory cells. It is unlikely that removal of the known PI-linked proteins on murine T cells, Thy-1 and Ly-6, can fully account for the inhibition of Con A response because the cell line M2B3, that lacks these surface proteins, responded normally to Con A stimulation. These studies demonstrate that one or more PI-anchored T cell proteins play an important role in an early step of Con A activation, perhaps involving T cell-accessory cell interactions. In contrast, the ability to stimulate T cells by direct cross-linking of TCR/CD3 complex is not dependent on the presence of these PI-anchored proteins.\r"

  ".W": "To study the potential immunologic functions of murine Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (Tdec), we used long term, IL-2-dependent, Tdec lines derived from the skin of C3H mice. Cells of the Tdec lines AU16 or AU4 were conjugated in vitro with the hapten FITC and injected s.c. into the footpad (ifp.) or i.v. into syngeneic recipient mice to assess their ability to induce or inhibit contact hypersensitivity (CHS). FITC-conjugated Tdec were unable to induce CHS after ifp. or i.v. injection. Furthermore, when mice were sensitized epicutaneously with FITC after the injection of FITC-conjugated Tdec, they were unable to mount a CHS response. These results indicated that hapten-conjugated Tdec are capable of inducing tolerance upon ifp. or i.v. injection. In contrast, ifp. injection of normal lymphocytes conjugated with FITC in vitro produced no impairment of the CHS response to FITC, although i.v. injection of these cells, as with that of FITC-conjugated Tdec, induced down-regulation of CHS. The immunologic tolerance induced by FITC-conjugated Tdec was Ag specific, but not H-2 restricted. Immunization with unconjugated Tdec either ifp. or i.v. did not induce tolerance, indicating that unconjugated Tdec by themselves are not suppressive. In addition, Tdec were unable to mediate a local graft-vs-host reaction in an F1 host. These results demonstrate that Tdec can induce immunologic tolerance and suggest that these cells may play a role in the down-regulation of cutaneous immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the responses of cloned T cell lines and of normal T cells to staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, and C1 (SEA, SEB, and SEC1). SEA, SEB, and SEC1 are all very potent mitogens for T cells in the presence of Ia+ APC. The minimal activating dose of all these SE varies from 1 to 100 ng/ml. As determined by mAb blocking of the responses of both normal T cells and cloned T cell lines, SEA required either the I-A or the I-E molecule on APC for stimulating T cells, whereas SEB required the I-E molecule predominantly over I-A molecule. The TCR:CD4 complex is also involved in the response to SE. The responses to SEB and SEC1 were inhibited by anti-V beta 8 antibody F23.1, whereas the response to SEA and to PHA was not affected by this antibody. Anti-CD4 effectively inhibited responses to all SE but not to PHA. The involvement of the TCR was also confirmed by flow microfluorimetry analysis of T cell blasts responding to SE and the responses of a panel of cloned T cell lines, both of which showed that V beta 8+ T cells preferentially responded to SEB, whereas V beta 8+ T cells failed to respond to SEA. By using fixed APC, it could be shown that processing is not required for the presentation of SE. Furthermore, pulsing experiments showed that SEB can bind to relevant sites on either B cells or T cells, whereas with conventional Ag only prepulsing of the APC has worked. In one case, SEB activates a cloned T cell line in the absence of APC, and this same clone also responds directly to anti-V beta 8 antibody. Thus, SEB appears to bring together V beta 8-expressing TCR with the I-E molecule, whereas SEA apparently has the same effect on TCR expressing different V beta with either the I-A or the I-E molecule, probably depending upon which TCR is bound. The close resemblance between T cell responses to SE and those to mixed-lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) locus suggests to us that a novel SE-like protein that binds both to class II MHC molecules on the APC surface and to V beta gene products on TCR could be the product of the Mls locus.\r"

We demonstrate that these donor-derived T cell clones, specifically reacting with the MHC Ag expressed on the recipient cells, do not produce IL-4 and do not express IL-4 mRNA upon Ag or polyclonal stimulations. In contrast, CD4+ tetanus toxin-specific T cell clones isolated from the same patient and having the same HLA phenotype produced normal amounts of IL-4 upon activation. These data suggest that the failure to produce IL-4 is a specific characteristic of these host-reactive clones and is not due to a genetic defect of the transplanted cells. Furthermore, different modes of activation resulted in simultaneous production of IL-5, IL-2, IFN-gamma, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, and transcription of the TNF-beta gene by the host-reactive clones, indicating that the lack of IL-4 production is not related to the mode of activation. The finding that some of these clones produce significant levels of IL-5 but no IL-4 indicates that the IL-4 and IL-5 genes are not always coexpressed in activated human T cells.\r"

Towards this end, surface markers on unseparated thymocytes and purified thymocyte subsets from age- and sex-matched diabetes-resistant (BBn) and diabetes-prone (BBd) rats were analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. The proportions of thymocytes falling into each of the four main phenotypic subsets were comparable in BBn (n = 9) and BBd (n = 8) rats: respectively, 4.6 +/- 0.6% and 4.4 +/- 0.8%, CD4-8-; 68.1 +/- 1.9% and 71.1 +/- 3.2%, CD4+8+; 18.3 +/- 1.5% and 15.4 +/- 2.3%, CD4+8-; 9.1 +/- 0.9% and 9.1 +/- 1.0%, CD4-8+. In addition, absolute numbers of thymocytes were not significantly different. The levels of expression of CD4, TCR-alpha beta within each thymocyte subset were comparable in BBn and BBd animals as were the anti-TCR-induced proliferative responses of their CD4+8- and CD4-8+ thymocytes. However, phenotypic abnormalities within the CD4-8+ thymocyte subset of the BBd rat were found. A very significant (p less than 0.005) deletion of mature CD4-8+, TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes and a proportional increase (p less than 0.005) of immature CD4-8+, TCR-alpha beta low thymocytes. Moreover, a twofold decrease of CD8 expression by mature CD4-8+ thymocytes was observed in BBd animals. These results suggest that an impaired thymic maturation contributes to the peripheral T lymphopenia of the BBd rat.\r"

PMA plus anti-CD3 up-regulated HC2 expression on T cells and IFN-gamma up-regulated expression on monocytes. On B cells, EBV transformation may result in HC2 expression, and antibody to HC2 has been found to inhibit B cell differentiation and proliferation.

  ".U": "90111155\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism whereby cytolytic lymphocytes protect themselves from killing mediated by their own cytotoxic protein, perforin, was studied. By using a competition assay, we demonstrated that the resistance of cells to perforin-mediated cytolysis is inversely correlated with their ability to absorb perforin, with tumor cells and noncytotoxic lymphocytes that are susceptible to perforin-mediated lysis being able to absorb perforin from the supernatant much better than CTL. The evidence implies that there is molecule on cytolytic lymphocytes that interferes with perforin-binding activity, resulting in the inability of perforin to lyse these cells. The molecule is most likely a surface protein or complex of proteins because its activity decreases after CTL treatment with the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and papain, and the activity can be recovered by incubation of the treated CTL cells at 37 degrees C for 6 h. The recovery can be blocked by emetine, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D, inhibitors of protein and RNA/DNA synthesis. The protein contains carbohydrate groups that play an important role in the function of the protein, as indicated by the fact that inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin and cleavage of sialic acid from the protein with neuraminidase result in a significant increase of perforin binding to CTL. Cross-linkage of CTL membrane proteins with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde and blockage of the functional domains of the protein with an antiserum against CTL also inhibit the activity of this protein. Temperature-dependence studies that allow for a dissociation of the binding and pore-forming stages of perforin-mediated hemolysis suggest that the protective protein interferes at the perforin-binding stage.\r"

Transmembrane pH and electrical gradients were determined using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In mitochondria, ubiquinones 9,10 and other redox components of the electron transport chain are reduced by anthralin; the proton motive force is increased. In the absence of ADP, anthralin slightly stimulates mitochondrial cyanide-insensitive oxygen consumption. It is suggested that increased cyanide-insensitive respiration is due to enhanced autoxidation of mitochondrial components and/or catalyzed oxidation of anthralin. In the presence of ADP mitochondrial respiration is decreased, and ATP synthesis is inhibited. Uncoupler-induced mitochondrial respiration is also decreased by anthralin, indicating inhibition of the electron transport chain. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6311 anthralin increases the pH gradient and decreases ATP levels. Thus, anthralin acts as an electron donor to membrane associated redox components and inhibits ATP synthesis in two different biologic systems. In human keratinocytes oxygen metabolism is influenced by anthralin in a similar pattern as in isolated mitochondria, and ATP content is decreased. Because anthralin reacts with redox components in different biologic membranes, alterations of subcellular/cellular redox status and energy metabolism might contribute significantly to its antiproliferative activity.\r"

  ".W": "In Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase (Bla) is typically associated with transducible plasmids that also encode metal resistance or with the more recently described conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. The beta-lactamase gene of Enterococcus faecalis, which has been shown to be highly homologous to bla from the S. aureus plasmid p1258, is also encoded on conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. To determine if the enterococcal Bla-encoding plasmids are similar to those from staphylococci, Bla-encoding plasmids from both species were compared by restriction endonuclease digestion followed by hybridization to Bla and gentamicin resistance gene probes and to one of the enterococcal Bla-encoding plasmids. Although similarities were noted in the restriction endonuclease digestion patterns among the transducible staphylococcal plasmids (pI524, pI258, and pII147) and among the conjugative Gmr staphylococcal plasmids, neither of these restriction patterns was similar to those of the enterococcal plasmids. Although the enterococcal plasmids showed extensive similarities by hybridization, the staphylococcal plasmids showed little or no similarity to the enterococcal plasmids except for bla and the gentamicin resistance genes. Whether enterococci acquired a different type of Bla-encoding plasmid or whether bla was acquired by transposition or by homologous recombination into enterococcal plasmids is unknown.\r"

Leucovorin was increased twofold and trimetrexate reduced by 50% or suspended briefly for various levels of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia until blood counts increased. Dosage-modifying hematologic toxicity occurred in 12 (46%), 8 (80%), 9 (75%), and 4 (67%) patients with the respective groups. Cytopenias were in each case reversible and other toxicities were well tolerated. All survivors but one were able to receive a full 21 doses of trimetrexate. Twenty-four (92%), 10 (100%), 7 (58%), and 4 (80%) of patients in the respective groups survived. Thus, the 45 mg/m2/day dosage of trimetrexate with 80 mg/m2/day of leucovorin resulted in the least dosage-modifying toxicity and excellent efficacy. This combination should be selected for studies to compare trimetrexate with other therapies for pneumocystis pneumonia.\r"

In this phase I study, 29 patients were treated with a 4-day continuous infusion ifosfamide to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and the nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity. Autologous bone marrow support was to have been used for the subsequent dose level if granulocytes were more than 500/microL for more than 14 days in two of two to five patients at a given dose level. Doses were escalated from 8 to 18 g/m2 ifosfamide. Mesna was given at an equivalent dose by continuous infusion for 5 days. At the 18 g/m2 dose level, dose-limiting renal insufficiency and a median of 11 days (range, 8 to 18 days) of granulocytopenia (less than 500/microL) were observed. Thus, autologous bone marrow reinfusion ws not used. The duration of myelosuppression, the frequency and severity of mucositis, and renal tubular acidosis were all dose-dependent. Mild to moderate CNS toxicity also appeared to be related to dose; however, severe CNS toxicity (transient confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence) was observed sporadically at both low- and high-dose levels. Transient hematuria (greater than 50 red blood cells [RBCs]/high power field) occurred once but did not affect treatment. There were nine responses (two complete) in 27 heavily pretreated assessable patients including seven responses in 20 patients with advanced refractory sarcoma. Ifosfamide with mesna uroprotection can undergo considerable dose escalation over the usual prescribed doses before nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity is encountered. Ifosfamide has broad cytotoxicity against solid tumors and may prove to be an important addition to high-dose combination chemotherapy regimens.\r"

  ".W": "In this randomized study involving patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCC), we compared treatment with either cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) or CAV plus etoposide (CAVE). All patients received identical thoracic radiation consisting of 3,750 cGy in 15 fractions and prophylactic cranial radiation (3,000 cGy in 10 fractions). Among 231 evaluable patients, the two treatment arms were well matched with respect to sex, age, performance score, and presence or absence of heart disease. A major regression (REGR) was observed in 83% of all patients and a complete response (CR) in 60%. There was no difference in the response rate between the two treatment regimens. The median time to progression is 10.4 months (95% confidence interval [Cl], 8.9 to 12 months) for CAVE versus 8.9 months (95% Cl, 7.9 to 10.4 months) for CAV (P = .04). The median survival is 15.1 months (95% Cl, 11.7 to 17.8 months) for CAVE versus 12.4 months (95% Cl, 11 to 14.4 months) for CAV. This difference is not significantly different (P = .13). Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression and was significantly greater for the four-drug regimen. Fatal treatment-related toxicity was observed in two patients on the CAVE regimen and no treatment-related deaths were observed on the CAV treatment. In conclusion, the addition of etoposide to the CAV regimen resulted in increased toxicity but did not lead to a meaningful improvement in survival.\r"

  ".W": "Conditioned media from two human malignant gliomas, C6 rat glioma, Walker 256 carcinosarcoma, and normal human glia were concentrated 50-fold to create a culture supernatant (SUP-C). The effect of SUP-C on rat brain capillary permeability was investigated by measuring the entry of 14C-aminoisobutyric acid (14C-AIB) by means of quantitative autoradiography. The SUP-C contained proteins with a molecular weight of 10 kD or greater. The SUP-C from all tumor cells markedly increased brain capillary permeability, indicating the presence of a permeability factor, whereas that from normal glial cells did not. Glioma cells produced more factor after incubation for 20 hours than 4 hours. The activity of capillary permeability factor in the SUP-C was inhibited by pretreatment of animals with BW755C (lipoxygenase inhibitor), but not with indomethacin (cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor). Pretreatment of animals with dexamethasone prior to intracerebral infusion of tumor SUP-C significantly reduced the factor-induced increase in capillary permeability. On the other hand, coincubating glioma cells with dexamethasone produced SUP-C with a permeability activity that was about one and a half times greater than that without dexamethasone. These results indicate that glucocorticoids produce their anti-edema effects by directly acting on capillary endothelial cells, possibly through the inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, resulting in a decrease of lipoxygenase rather than cyclo-oxygenase products. The production of capillary permeability factor by tumor cells was not inhibited, but rather enhanced, by administration of glucocorticoids.\r"

Prenatal exposure (indicated by umbilical cord serum PCB level) predicted poorer short-term memory function on both verbal and quantitative tests in a dose-dependent fashion. These effects cannot be attributed to a broad range of potential confounding variables, the impact of which was evaluated statistically. Although much larger quantities of PCBs are transferred postnatally via lactation than prenatally across the placenta, exposure from nursing was unrelated to cognitive performance. The data demonstrate the continuation of a toxic impact received in utero and observed initially during infancy on a dimension of cognitive functioning fundamental to learning.\r"

Significant correlations existed between urinary lead excretion (PbU) on the control day at 12- and 24-hour collection intervals and on the first day of chelation (p less than 0.0001). Published criteria for positive edetate disodium calcium provocative tests were used to calculate corresponding cutoff points for unstimulated 24-hour PbU. Resultant PbU values ranged from 10.4 to 35.6 micrograms (0.05 to 0.17 mumol).

Six patients had AIDS, one was seropositive and asymptomatic, and four had risk factors for HIV infection. While the annual number of cases of listeriosis in patients without risk factors for HIV infection was constant, 9 of the 11 patients with AIDS or with risk factors for HIV infection presented with listeriosis between 1985 and 1988, the last half of the survey period. These patients were male homosexuals or intravenous drug abusers, and all but one were black or Hispanic. Manifestations of listeriosis in patients with AIDS or with risk factors for HIV infection included bacteremia without apparent source in seven, meningitis in three, and endocarditis in one, syndromes that were similar to those in patients without risk factors for HIV infection. Ten of 11 patients were treated with penicillin or ampicillin, and 7 were also given an aminoglycoside. All patients responded well to therapy and no relapses were observed. Physicians should include antibiotics effective against L. monocytogenes when treating AIDS patients with meningitis of unknown origin and consider the diagnosis of listeriosis in patients with sepsis of unknown origin.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) was used for the treatment of 16 patients with various stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). All patients had been previously treated with standard topical and/or systemic therapies, and some had received experimental treatment with retinoids, recombinant human interferon alfa-2a (rIFN-alpha 2a), or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies; most patients had an advanced stage of disease. Objective partial responses (PRs) were noted in five patients (31%) and lasted 3 months to greater than 32 months (median, 10 mo). One of these five patients had previously had disease progression after an initial PR with rIFN-alpha 2a. Six other patients (38%) showed minor or mixed responses. The most common side effects of rIFN-gamma included fever, weight loss, mild neutropenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Additionally, one episode of nephrotic syndrome and one cutaneous allergic reaction were noted. None of the toxic effects were life threatening, and all were reversible. These results suggest that rIFN-gamma has efficacy in the treatment of CTCL refractory to rIFN-alpha 2a.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that exogenous expression of the mouse interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene augmented the cell-killing potential of a line of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific against a murine glioma line (203-glioma). In the present work, we further investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of the E gamma-6 and E gamma-9 sublines of this CTL line transfected with the IFN-gamma gene. Using the Winn assay to test the neutralization of subcutaneous gliomas, we determined that these CTL sublines were more effective than the E-4 parent CTL line and that suppression of the tumor growth was dependent on the number of effector cells (CTLs). Moreover, intravenous injection of E gamma-9 cells was more effective in suppressing the tumor growth than intravenous injection of E-4 cells. These results suggest that transfection of antitumor effector cells with the IFN-gamma gene could improve the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Dysfunctional monocytes (M phi), exerting their inhibitory functions via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been implicated in the depression of immune responses following major surgical, accidental, and burn trauma. A randomized prospective study of the PG-synthetase inhibitor indomethacin (Indo) was performed in 43 patients undergoing major surgical procedures, to evaluate its efficacy in correcting postoperative abnormalities of the cell-mediated immune system (CMI) and preventing infectious morbidity and mortality. Patients, following gastrectomy (GX) or reconstruction of the abdominal aorta (AG), in the treated group (PIndo), received 100 mg IV of Indo 6 hours postoperatively and 3 x 50 mg IV Indo over 24 hours on postoperative days (D) 1,2,3,4. The rate of infectious complications was recorded. Parameters of CMI evaluated preoperatively (D0) and on D1,D3,D5,D7 were: Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to recall antigens, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (LP), interleukin 2 (IL-2) synthesis, and phenotyping of mononuclear blood leukocytes (PBMC's) with the monoclonal antibodies for CD3+, CD4+, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)+ and LeuM3+ receptor sites. In contrast to the group of untreated patients (Pc), PIndo did not show a depression of their preoperative DTH responses, and they also showed a lower rate of early opportunistic infections. The in vitro test of CMI revealed that there was a higher LP capacity in PBMC's of PIndo (p less than 0.05); the postoperative profile of IL-2 synthesis was not statistically different between the groups. Indomethacin administration resulted in a considerable alleviation of postoperative monocytosis (p less than 0.05) and in a protective effect on lymphocyte receptor expression of CD3+, CD4+, and IL-2R+ cells. From these data it is concluded that in vivo cyclooxygenase inhibition may be useful to prevent impairment of CMI, a crucial predisposing factor of the high susceptibility to postoperative infection.\r"

We investigated the ability of iloprost to decrease skeletal muscle injury and platelet sequestration after ischemia-reperfusion injury in a canine bilateral isolated gracilis muscle model. Anesthesized animals (n = 13) were subjected to 6 hours of gracilis muscle ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Fifteen minutes before muscle reperfusion, the animals were infused with radium 111-labeled autogenous platelets. Experimental animals (n = 7) received a continuous preischemic intravenous infusion of iloprost (0.45 microgram/kg/hr) and two 0.45 microgram/kg intravenous injections of iloprost (10 minutes before the ischemic interval and 10 minutes before reperfusion). Muscle injury was measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining. Platelet sequestration within ischemic muscle specimens was determined by measuring indium 111 activity in a gamma counter. Iloprost infusion decreased muscle infarct size from 57.0% +/- 12.6% in control animals to 15.8% +/- 4.4% in experimental animals (p less than 0.05). Platelet uptake in experimental and control muscle was 1.2 +/- 0.21 x 10(7) and 2.17 +/- 0.48 x 10(7) platelets/gm ischemic muscle, respectively (p = 0.1). Although platelet sequestration was not altered significantly in this experiment, a reduction in skeletal muscle injury was confirmed. Further investigation on the mechanisms of action of iloprost in chronic and acute skeletal muscle ischemia is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of administered human growth hormone (hGH) on protein metabolism in septic rats was investigated. Fifty-three male Wistar rates with SVC cannulation were divided into four groups. Group I (n = 10) underwent sham-operation. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation in group II (n = 19), group III (n = 10), and group IV (n = 14). Isocaloric, isonitrogenous glucose/amino acids were infused for 4 days. hGH was administered in group III (100 mU/day) and group IV (200 mU/day) every day. Cumulative nitrogen balance (mg/kg) in group IV was significantly higher than in group II (p less than 0.01): group I, 1264 +/- 355; group II, 117 +/- 693; group III, 92 +/- 735; group IV, 1001 +/- 279. Cumulative urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH, mg/kg) did not differ between group II and group IV: group I, 6.2 +/- 0.9; group II, 12.0 +/- 2.2; group III, 13.4 +/- 2.9; group IV, 10.5 +/- 2.3. Serum albumin level in group IV (1.8 +/- 0.2 g/dl) was significantly higher than in group II (1.5 +/- 0.2 g/dl) (p less than 0.01). Blood urea nitrogen level in group IV (12.6 +/- 2.3 mg/dl) was significantly lower than in group II (18.8 +/- 7.4 mg/dl) (p less than 0.05). Although serum levels of glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and phospholipid were higher in sepsis groups than in sham-operated group, those levels did not differ among sepsis groups. Administration of hGH, 200 mU/day, resulted in marked nitrogen retention and had little effect on 3-MH excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An increased incidence of gallbladder disease is seen in patients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (PN). Stasis is thought to play a key role in the development of gallbladder sludge and gallstone formation. The highest incidence of gallbladder disease, by previous reports, is seen in patients with terminal ileal disease or resection. Since PN-dependent patients with severe short bowel syndrome secondary to mesenteric vascular accident have both gallbladder stasis and massive small bowel resection, a retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of symptomatic gallbladder disease in this group. Of 11 patients followed over 9 years, five met the inclusion criteria of less than 60 cm of bowel remaining, receiving PN for longer than 6 months and the initial presence of a gallbladder. All five patients developed symptomatic gallbladder disease manifested by cholecystitis or pancreatitis. Factors contributing to gallbladder stasis included poor oral intake and use of anticholinergic and analgesic drugs. Gastric hypersecretion indirectly contributed to decreased oral intake as a means to minimize stool output. As these patients often require several laparotomies during the initial hospitalization, consideration should be given to performing prophylactic cholecystectomy, especially when the potential mortality and morbidity of emergent cholecystectomy done for symptomatic gallbladder disease is taken into account.\r"

We compared Vivonex HN (810 mOsm) to Osmolite (300 mOsm) in two canine ileus models. After having bipolar electrodes implanted in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and colon, four dogs sequentially underwent operations to produce intestinal obstruction (SBO) or perforation/peritonitis (PER). The SBO was released and the perforation closed 24 hr later. GI myoelectric activity (MEA) was monitored during the first 4 postoperative days and again on the 10th day to determine steady-state MEA. Fasting MEA was recorded for 1 hr, followed by 1-hr recordings after intragastric cannula infusion of either Vivonex HN or Osmolite. There was no significant difference in MEA produced by Osmolite vs Vivonex at any recording site. The 24-hr postop gastric and small bowel MEA was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) vs postoperative days 2 to 4 and 10 under both fasting and fed conditions. The ileus operations had no effect on colonic MEA. These data show that SBO and PER cause significant decreases in gastrointestinal MEA for 24 hr. There was no difference in MEA response of Osmolite vs Vivonex HN. These results suggest that infusion of hypertonic enteral alimentation solutions does not produce increases in GI myoelectric responsiveness vs isotonic solutions.\r"

The patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Twelve patients (the \"glucose group\") received all 'nonprotein' calories as glucose, the remaining 12 (the \"fat-glucose group\") received 60% of 'nonprotein' calories as fat emulsion (Intralipid). Amino acids (FreAmine II) were supplied to give a calorie/nitrogen ratio of 150:1. Total calories were supplied at a rate of 1.4 times the measured resting energy expenditure of each patient. Body composition was measured using routine anthropometric techniques and in vivo neutron activation analysis. Significant increases in body fat and total body potassium (TBK) were recorded in the glucose group, but there was no significant change in total body water (TBW) or total body nitrogen (TBN) in either group. The initial value of the ratio of TBK:TBW had a significant negative correlation with the change of TBK in both groups, and with the change of TBN in the glucose group. The study demonstrates the importance of considering nutritional status when analyzing the effects of intravenous nutrition. Glucose as the sole source of calories induced an increase in body potassium independent of protein synthesis; this effect was not observed in patients who received 60% of their energy supply as lipid emulsion.\r"

Their catheter-related complications are compared to two control populations using the external catheter. Group I compares the 46 patients who all started HPN in the same 5-year period, group II compares 17 patients with experience of both types of venous access. For the entire 58 patients the average infusion time was 22 months (1 month-8.2 yr) and the average complication rate was about one complication every 2 years. Analyzing the separate groups however, group I implanted reservoir patients did better than those with the external catheter (p less than 0.05) and group II external catheter patients did better than those with the implanted reservoir (p less than 0.05). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the greater medical competence of group I patients selecting the reservoir. The data show a clear separation of patients into those who have minimal complications with either device and others who have several complications with both. Two-thirds of the complications were infectious, one third mechanical. The infectious complications were similar with both catheters; clotting was more common with the external catheter and skin erosion was seen only with the reservoir. Eighty % of patients with experience with both type of venous access preferred the implanted reservoir.\r"

One type of TPN was enriched in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine (45% BCAA content), and the other was conventional TPN (21% BCAA content). Burned rats received isocaloric and isonitrogeneous TPN solutions for 48 hr after resuscitation by saline infusion for 24 hr. Liver and rectus abdominis muscle were removed from the rats at 7, 24, 48, and 72 hr. The concentrations of adenine nucleotides, RNA, protein, glucose-6-phosphate, hepatic glycogen, muscle phosphocreatine, and 3-methylhistidine were determined. Metabolic alterations occurred during the period of saline resuscitation (0-24 hr). At 48 hr the RNA and protein levels were significantly more improved in the BCAA-TPN group than in the conventional TPN group. At 72 hr, however, the results for the two groups were similar in most metabolite levels. Thus, BCAA-TPN enriched in leucine rapidly stimulated protein synthesis in the liver and muscle. This rapid effect may make it useful during the initial nutritional management of severe trauma patients.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma lipid concentrations and high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass distributions were evaluated in 22 newborn infants nourished with intravenous (iv)-fat. The majority of infants were premature with respiratory distress syndrome. Based on baseline (prior to iv-fat) HDL subclass profiles determined by gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), infants fell into two classes, one with two or more pronounced peaks within the normal HDL spectrum (group I, 17 subjects) and the other with highly unusual HDL distribution (group II, five subjects). Total plasma cholesterol increased in both groups during low and high fat intravenous feeding. HDL-cholesterol, however, did not change with iv-fat where mean values for groups I and II at baseline, iv-low fat and -high fat were: group I, 31.2 +/- 7.1, 30.0 +/- 8.8, and 36.6 +/- 16.7 mg/dl, respectively; and group II, 20.0 +/- 7.8, 20.2 +/- 7.4, and 19.8 +/- 8.8 mg/dl, respectively. Unlike HDL-cholesterol levels that remained constant with iv-fat, apolipoprotein (apo) AI concentrations increased significantly: group I, 73.0 +/- 11.0, 88.3 +/- 15.9, and 93.1 +/- 21.9 mg/dl, respectively; and group II, 31.8 +/- 10.5, 41.0 +/- 12.8, and 59.3 +/- 18.5 mg/dl, respectively. In group I infants, iv-fat is associated with an increase in larger-sized particles, particularly in the (HDL2b)gge range; in group II there is an increase in (HDL3b)gge and (HDL3c)gge components and a disappearance of particles that fall outside of the size range of normal HDL. In both groups, enteral feeding is associated with a further normalization of HDL subclass distribution. The aberrant GGE profiles and very low apoAI levels of group II infants at baseline were associated with unusual HDL morphology determined by electron microscopy where discoidal structures were prominent. With iv-fat, discoidal particles decline in number while normal spherical structures increase. Prevalence of discoidal HDL at baseline was associated with low concentrations of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (1.12 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml); with iv-fat this enzyme rose to 1.61 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml. Increased LCAT is associated with the normalization of HDL morphology. It is likely that iv-fat improves the nutritional status of premature infants, thereby stimulating increased liver synthesis of important proteins, including apoAI and LCAT, associated with HDL metabolism.\r"

Drug concentrations were analyzed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. TNA/drug admixtures were pH tested and visually inspected before and after centrifugation in microhematocrit tubes, noting signs of emulsion stability at 1 and 6 hr. Emulsion particle size was determined at 1 and 6 hr using interference contrast microscopy. All three drugs retained their immunoreactivity in all TNAs for at least 6 hr. G and T were stable in all eight TNAs for at least 6 hr with no significant effect on emulsion particle size or stability after centrifugation. A was incompatible with all eight TNAs, resulting in visual breaking of all emulsions within 1 hr.

Following 7 days TPN plasma vitamin E status increased significantly (p less than 0.001). However, this was due mostly to increases in the circulating level of beta + gamma-tocopherols. RBC vitamin E status was also significantly increased (p less than 0.001) following TPN, however, this was again due to incorporation of non-alpha-tocopherols. In a second study a alpha-tocopherol supplement, Vitlipid N, (9.1 mg alpha-tocopherol/day) was included in the feed. In these patients, large increases in plasma concentrations of non-alpha-tocopherol isomers were accompanied by an apparent improvement in alpha-tocopherol status (0.64 vs 0.44 mg/dl after 7 days). However, RBC alpha-tocopherol concentration did not change appreciably in these patients following either 7 or 14 days feeding. It is concluded that RBC vitamin E status is markedly influenced by the available plasma tocopherol pool and that provision of a small supplement of alpha-tocopherol is not sufficient to compete with the high concentration of non-alpha-isomers present in Intralipid. TPN utilizing fat emulsions containing high levels of non-alpha-tocopherol isomers (even when accompanied by alpha-tocopherol supplements) does not improve alpha-tocopherol status.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five preterm infants with birth weights (BW) 540 to 2280 g (20 with birth weight less than 1500 g) and gestational ages 24 to 37 weeks, were studied to determine the response to 2 levels of aluminum (Al) loading from currently unavoidable contamination of various components of parenteral nutrition (PN) solution. High Al loading group (H) received solutions with measured Al content of 306 +/- 16 micrograms/liter and low A1 loading group (L) received solutions with 144 +/- 16 micrograms A1/liter. Urine Al:Creatinine (Al:Cr) ratios (micrograms:mg) became elevated and significantly higher in H (1.6 +/- 0.38 vs 0.5 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05) at the third sampling point (mean 19 days). Serum Al concentrations were highest at onset in both groups and stabilized with study but remained consistently higher than the normal median of 18 micrograms/liter. Calculated urine Al excretion were consistently low and were 34 +/- 6% vs 28 +/- 5% in the H and L groups, respectively. One infant in the L group who died 39 days after termination of above study showed the presence of A1 in bone trabeculae and the presence of excessive unmineralized osteoid along the trabeculae. We conclude that small preterm infants are able to increase urine Al excretion with increased Al load. However urine Al excretion is incomplete with bone deposition of Al and persistently elevated serum Al concentrations.\r"

The type and quantity of the formula were individually tailored to the patients' needs. Caloric intake (mean +/- SEM) amounted to 1564 +/- 97 kcal/day. Vitamins intake from the formulas, expressed as percent of Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA), was as follows: pantothenic acid, 222 +/- 44%; vitamin B12, 206 +/- 34%; vitamin C, 376 +/- 51%; thiamine, 207 +/- 34%; niacin, 207 +/- 34%; riboflavin, 207 +/- 34%; pyridoxine, 222 +/- 17%; biotin, 113 +/- 13%; vitamin A, 93 +/- 4%; and folic acid, 104 +/- 14%. Plasma levels of thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folic acid, and vitamin B12 were within normal limits in all patients. Two patients had lower than normal plasma levels of nicotinic acid despite the high intake. Plasma biotin levels were above normal in all patients, with a mean of 931 +/- 140 pg/ml (N: 200-500 pg/ml). Ascorbic acid levels were within or above normal, but no correlation with intake was found. Carotene levels were measured in five patients and found to be below the lower limit of normal, a reflection of lack of intake from the enteral formulas. The plasma vitamin A levels were normal in all patients. It is concluded that feeding with commercial enteral formulas results in normal plasma levels of vitamins in patients maintained on these formulas for over 6 months. The excessive amounts of vitamins in the formulas do not result in elevated plasma levels, except for Biotin.\r"

Computerized trend analysis of daily Apache II scores, corrected for the presence, number, and duration of major organ system failures was used to predict individual hospital outcome among 50 intensive care unit patients treated with TPN. Thirteen of the 18 deaths were correctly predicted without any false predictions. During the study, the results of predictions were not used to influence clinical decision making. If TPN was withheld in the five patients predicted to die before starting TPN, or withdrawn in the eight patients when they were predicted to die, $28,350 or 11.5% of the cost of TPN during the study period would have been saved. This hypothetical study shows that elimination of inappropriate treatment of patients with hopeless prognosis with the aim of avoiding the prolongation of the process of dying and unnecessary suffering is a compassionate patient-selection strategy that can result in major savings in healthcare resources.\r"

Three different infusions systems (A, B, and C) were tested and eight bags for each system were used. An elevated insulin adsorption resulted in each system. The maximal insulin recovery, expressed as percentage of the original theoretical 3333 microIU/ml insulin concentration, was 19.54% (at time 6), 20.93% (at time 4), and 16.95% (at time 22) for system A, B, and C, respectively. \"Dismissed insulin amount\" after 24-hr infusion was 1590 +/- 279.5 microIU, 1505.8 +/- 430.5 microIU, and 1253.3 +/- 369.8 microIU for system A, B, and C, respectively. Comparison of insulin concentration values at different times revealed significant differences only at time 18 (if compared with times 0,2.4,6,8,12,14,16) ant at time 20 (if compared with time 4,6,8,10) for system A, and at time 4 (if compared with time 12,14,16,18,20,22,24) for system B. We conclude that a constant but low insulin delivery can be achieved using 3-liter EVA systems and a 24-hr infusion.\r"

Large group studies, however, have demonstrated the efficacy of treating mild hypertension. Public health efforts during the past 16 years have increased the number of hypertensive patients made aware of their condition and brought into treatment. A major problem, however, is consistently maintaining patients on long-term therapy. A large number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments have become available for the management of hypertension. These treatments must be applied individually to enhance benefit, minimize potential harm, and increase the likelihood of long-term compliance for what is often a lifelong disorder. For accomplishing this goal, a thorough understanding of important characteristics of both the individual patient and the available therapeutic modalities is needed.\r"

Studies to date have generally failed to confirm the superiority of one form of treatment over another, although there is some evidence that high-dose 5-ASA enemas are superior to hydrocortisone enemas. Patients who fail to respond to one form of therapy may respond to another therapeutic modality. Continued evaluation of topical therapies provides not only an opportunity to improve the treatment prospects for patients but also allows for examination of potential mechanisms of action of therapeutically active compounds. Future research directions should also include assessment of combination therapy, the more widespread use of suppositories, and strategies to encourage patient compliance. Larger multicenter trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of some of the newer compounds. The role of topical therapy for patients with Crohn's disease confined to the left colon requires evaluation.\r"

Of fifteen chronic NANBH patients and one patient with chronic cryptogenic liver disease, ten were positive for anti-C100-3 and seven of the ten had viral sequences in their livers. However, two patients negative for anti-C100-3 also had substantial levels of HCV RNA in their livers. In acute post-transfusion NANBH (one surgical patient and two experimentally infected chimpanzees), HCV RNA was detected in the absence of anti-C100-3. In addition, infectious plasma from a seronegative patient with acute post-transfusion NANBH and a seronegative pool of plasma from a chimpanzee with chronic post-transfusion NANBH had high levels of HCV. These findings show that anti-C100-3-positive patients with chronic post-transfusion NANBH are likely to be viraemic; confirm that antibodies to C100-3 are a marker for infectivity; and suggest that the prevalence of HCV infections may be underestimated from the frequency of antibodies to C100-3 alone.\r"

Serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (S-Pro(III)-N-P) was used as an indicator of type III collagen synthesis and serum creatine kinase (S-CK) as a nonspecific muscular marker. S-CK, S-CA III, and S-GGT were increased immediately following the skiing relay by 870%, 640%, and 40%, respectively. No significant change was observed in the concentration of S-Pro(III)-N-P following the exercise. A high positive correlation (rs = 0.92, P less than 0.01) was found between the increase in S-CA III and S-CK, whereas no correlation was observed between these muscular markers and S-GGT. The results suggest leakage from type I skeletal muscle cells and collagen synthesizing cells as a consequence of prolonged cross-country skiing, but there seems to exist no dependence between acute responses in muscular and connective tissue cells to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of weakness was investigated in a patient with adynamia episodica hereditaria without myotonia. A pattern of exercise and rest produced episodes of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. In addition, local muscle weakness was induced by forearm cooling. Investigations on isolated intercostal muscle demonstrated that a high potassium concentration in the bathing solution triggered a noninactivating membrane current causing depolarization of the muscle fibers. This current was carried by sodium as it could be inhibited by tetrodotoxin. The abnormal sodium conductance led to an increase of sodium within the fibers. This was demonstrated directly by intracellular recordings. Weakness induced by rest after exercise and cold-induced weakness appeared to have different pathomechanisms. In the cold, the muscle fibers retained a normal resting potential, but their excitability was reduced and their mechanical threshold was increased. These findings also provide evidence that the mechanism of cold-induced weakness in adynamia episodica is distinctly different from the cold-induced weakness that occurs in paramyotonia congenita.\r"

In spite of the detailed understanding of phospholipase C structure and phosphatidyl inositol signalling, the identity of the GTP-binding protein involved is so far unknown. To address this issue, we have used the Xenopus oocyte in which muscarinic receptors couple to phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. In this cell, InsP3 mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ to evoke a Cl- current. The magnitude of this Cl- current is proportional to the amount of InsP3 in the cell, and therefore can be used as an assay for InsP3 production. We report here that the activated alpha-subunit of the GTP-binding protein GO, when directly injected into oocytes, evokes a Cl- current by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular InsP3-sensitive stores. We also show that holo-GO, when injected into oocytes, can specifically enhance the muscarinic receptor-stimulated Cl- current. These data indicate that GO can serve as the signal transducer of the receptor-regulated phospholipase C in Xenopus oocytes.\r"

Aberrant binding of the human factor to a mutant site has been implicated in one form of hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH; ref. 2). The complementary DNAs for both the chicken cEryf 1 (ref. 11) and mouse mEryf 1 (ref. 12) encoding genes have recently been cloned. We report here the cloning of the cDNA for the human Eryf 1 encoding gene. The central third of the hEryf 1 cDNA, containing two 'finger' motifs, is almost identical to that of chicken or mouse. The amino-and carboxy-terminal thirds of the human protein are similar to those of mouse, but are strikingly different from the corresponding domains in chicken. The evidence indicates that these erythroid regulatory factors evolved from a common precursor composed of two distinct kinds of repeated domains, which subsequently evolved at greatly different rates.\r"

The scrapie prion protein isoform (PrPSc) is the only macromolecule identified to date which is a component of the infectious prion particle. PrPSc is converted to PrP 27-30 by limited proteolysis while the cellular isoform, designated PrPC, is completely digested under the same conditions. ELISA studies demonstrated that native PrP 27-30 bound to plastic surfaces resisted proteolysis and exhibited little or no immunoreactivity but after denaturation with guanidinium thiocyanate (GdnSCN), immunoreactivity was greatly enhanced. PrPSc bound to nitrocellulose also exhibited enhanced immunoreactivity after denaturation. PrPSc was readily detected in brain extracts from scrapie-infected hamsters, mice, and sheep by dot-blot immunoassays using limited proteolysis followed by GdnSCN denaturation. The high sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay allowed detection of regional differences in PrPSc in sheep brain. CJD prion protein isoform (PrPCJD) was also detected in the brains of all 10 patients tested with neuropathologically confirmed CJD and in 1 patient with GSS. Enhanced immunoreactivity of PrPSc or PrPCJD after denaturation cannot only be used for immunodiagnosis of prion diseases but may also form the basis of new assays in experimental studies directed at the chemical structure of the prion particle.\r"

We then mapped seizure cortex and essential cortex using chronic ECoG arrays. Two ECoG patterns were similar in frontal and temporal seizures. Focal patterns were near lesions and resections. Regional patterns were distant from lesions but not associated with worse surgical outcome. \"Dipolar\" seizure patterns occurred in one-half of frontal patients with maps like somatosensory evoked responses, consistent with focal seizure anatomy and involvement of sensorimotor cortex. Dipole location estimates were near centers of seizure cortex determined by lesions, semiology, and outcome. Six temporal patients had focal excisions that gave significant seizure reduction in all. All frontocentral patients had focal excisions that significantly reduced seizures except in 1 patient with progressive disease. We conclude that dorsolateral frontocentral seizures have focal functional anatomy that can be predicted by ictal ECoG.\r"

During the same period, the concentrations in serum and saliva peaked and started to decline. Fifteen hours after intake, vaginal fluid contained more than 1 mg/L, whereas no activity was found in serum or saliva. During the 10-day course of treatment, vaginal concentrations ranged between 2-3 mg/L. The drug was not eliminated from the vagina until the second day after ceasing medication. The accumulation and slow pharmacokinetics of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the vagina may be explained by the countercurrent vascular system supplying the internal genitalia and upper vagina. The effect of the high concentrations of penicillin on the vaginal microflora is discussed.\r"

A national survey was conducted of firms offering health insurance to employees and their dependents. Data were collected concerning private health insurance coverage of services needed by chronically ill children, including basic medical care services, ancillary therapies, mental health services, and long-term care. Nearly all surveyed firms offered health insurance. Coverage of inpatient hospital care, outpatient physician services, medical supplies and equipment, x-ray studies, laboratory services, and prescription medications was widespread, but coverage of services such as physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and nutrition services was much less prevalent. More than two thirds of the firms covered comprehensive home health services but often with limits and only in lieu of more expensive inpatient care. Long-term care, such as skilled nursing home care, was covered by only one third of firms. Overall, the survey results, combined with information concerning recent trends in private health insurance, reveal increasing coverage of lower cost alternatives to hospital or institutional care and improved maximum lifetime benefits and stop-loss coverage but also increased cost-sharing requirements. These results suggest that, although families with chronically ill children may have access to a widening range of services such as home health care or individual benefits management, they may be forced to bear an increasing proportion of the cost.\r"

The incidence was low and constant until 1983, when an increase, attributable to infections in infants older than 7 days of age (late-onset), was noted. These infants were more premature (mean gestational age 29.5 vs 36.9 weeks) and had lower birth weights (mean 1250 vs 2700 g) than those with early-onset enterococcal sepsis, and in most the infections were characterized by a nosocomial origin. Infants with early-onset infection had a mild illness with respiratory distress typical of other etiologic agents or diarrhea without focal infection. By contrast, late-onset enterococcal sepsis was heralded by severe apnea, bradycardia, circulatory collapse, and increased ventilatory requirements. Focal infections, including scalp abscess or catheter-related infection (23% each), meningitis or pneumonia (15% each), were common. Rapid clinical improvement and clearance of bacteremia resulted from therapy with an aminoglycoside and either ampicillin or vancomycin, but only if abscesses were drained and intravascular catheters were removed. Mortality rates for early-onset, late-onset, and necrotizing enterocolitis-associated infection were 6, 8, and 17%, respectively. Enterococcus is a frequent cause of late-onset septicemia in premature neonates, and empiric therapy should include appropriate antimicrobial agents.\r"

Elective cardioversion should be strongly considered for every patient, chiefly to decrease the incidence of embolic stroke. Patients who remain in chronic atrial fibrillation require attention to rate control; digoxin (Lanoxin) alone may be a poor choice if they are vigorous and active. Many subgroups of patients benefit from long-term anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "The \"zinc finger\" model [Miller, J., McLachlan, A. D. & Klug, A. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1609-1614; Brown, R. S., Sander, C. & Argos, P. (1985) FEBS Lett. 186, 271-274] makes both specific structural and specific functional predictions about zinc finger consensus sequences that can be tested with a combination of genetic, molecular biological, and biophysical techniques. The yeast transcription factor ADR1 contains two adjacent zinc finger domains; genetic and deletion analyses showed that amino acid substitutions and deletions in the zinc finger domains resulted in the loss of protein activity. To test the structural and folding predictions of the zinc finger model, peptides encompassing each of the ADR1 fingers were synthesized (ADR1a and ADR1b) as well as a mutant finger peptide (del138) deleted for a single amino acid residue. The folding and metal-binding characteristics of these were assessed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and visible spectroscopy. While a single unique conformational species was detected for the two wild-type peptides upon tetrahedral binding of zinc, the deletion peptide did not bind zinc with tetrahedral geometry, nor did it fold into a zinc finger domain. The metal-binding and folding results found with the mutant peptide were similar to those obtained when thiol alkylation or imidazole protonation of the wild-type peptides was performed. These data indicate that ligand spacing and both thiol and imidazole participation in zinc binding are specific and necessary requirements for zinc finger folding, which provides direct support for the initial predictions of the model.\r"

  ".W": "The x-ray crystallographic structures of 12 zinc enzymes have been chosen as standards of reference to identify the ligands to the catalytic and structural zinc atoms of other members of their respective enzyme families. Universally, H2O is a ligand and critical component of the catalytically active zinc sites. In addition, three protein side chains bind to the catalytic zinc atom, whereas four protein ligands bind to the structural zinc atom. The geometry and coordination number of zinc can vary greatly to accommodate particular ligands. Zinc forms complexes with nitrogen and oxygen just as readily as with sulfur, and this is reflected in catalytic zinc sites having a binding frequency of His much greater than Glu greater than Asp = Cys, three of which bind to the metal atom. The systematic spacing between the ligands is striking. For all catalytic zinc sites except the coenzyme-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, the first two ligands are separated by a \"short-spacer\" consisting of 1 to 3 amino acids. These ligands are separated from the third ligand by a \"long spacer\" of approximately 20 to approximately 120 amino acids. The spacer enables formation of a primary bidentate zinc complex, whereas the long spacer contributes flexibility to the coordination sphere, which can poise the zinc for catalysis as well as bring other catalytic and substrate binding groups into apposition with the active site. The H2O is activated by ionization, polarization, or poised for displacement. Collectively, the data imply that the preferred mechanistic pathway for activating the water--e.g., zinc hydroxide or Lewis acid catalysis--will be determined by the identity of the other three ligands and their spacing.\r"

  ".U": "90115852\r", 
  ".W": "Albumin Redhill is an electrophoretically slow genetic variant of human serum albumin that does not bind 63Ni2+ and has a molecular mass 2.5 kDa higher than normal albumin. Its inability to bind Ni2+ was explained by the finding of an additional residue of Arg at position -1. This did not explain the molecular basis of the genetic variation (since proalbumin contains adjacent Arg residues at -1 and -2) or the increase in apparent molecular mass. Fractionation of tryptic digests on concanavalin A-Sepharose followed by peptide mapping of the bound and unbound fractions and sequence analysis of the glycopeptides identified a mutation of 320 Ala----Thr. This introduces an Asn-Tyr-Thr oligosaccharide attachment sequence centered on Asn-318 and explains the increase in molecular mass. This, however, did not satisfactorily explain the presence of the additional Arg residue at position -1. DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genomic DNA encoding the prepro sequence of albumin indicated an additional mutation of -2 Arg----Cys. This introduces a prepro sequence, Met-Lys-Trp-Val-Thr-Phe-Ile-Ser-Leu-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe-Ser-Ser-Ala-Tyr- Ser-Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Cys-Arg (cf.-Tyr-Ser-Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg- in normal human pre-proalbumin). We propose that the new Phe-Cys-Arg sequence in the propeptide is an aberrant signal peptidase cleavage site and that the signal peptidase cleaves the propeptide of albumin Redhill in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum before it reaches the Golgi vesicles, the site of the diarginyl-specific proalbumin convertase.\r"

  ".U": "90115863\r", 
  ".W": "Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), a single-chain polypeptide toxin of 613 amino acids, consists of three functional domains: an amino-terminal receptor-binding domain, a middle translocation domain, and a carboxyl-terminal ADP-ribosylation domain. Deletion of as few as 2 or as many as 11 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of PE does not affect ADP-ribosylation activity but produces noncytotoxic molecules. Deletions and substitutions between positions 602 and 611 of PE show that the last 5 amino acids of PE are very important for its cytotoxic action. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of PE is Arg-Glu-Asp-Leu-Lys. Mutational analysis indicates that a basic amino acid at 609, acidic amino acids at 610 and 611, and a leucine at 612 are required for full cytotoxic activity. Lysine at 613 can be deleted or replaced with arginine but not with several other amino acids. Mutant toxins are able to bind normally to target Swiss mouse 3T3 cells and are internalized by endocytosis, but apparently they do not penetrate into the cytosol. A PE molecule that ends with Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, which is a well defined endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence [Munro, S. and Pelham, R. B. (1987) Cell 48, 899-907], is fully cytotoxic, suggesting that a common factor may be involved in intoxication of cells by PE and retention of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Sequences similar to those at the carboxyl end of PE are also found at the end of Cholera toxin A chain and Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin A chain.\r"

The failure is associated with generalized T-cell lymphopenia and marked reduction in the frequency of CD8+ cells. The few remaining CD8+ cells are widely held to be natural killer cells rather than class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T lymphocytes. In this report we show that a detectable percentage of CD8+ lymphocytes express the T-cell receptor for antigen, thus identifying them as part of the T-cell lineage. The failure of these CD8+ T-cell-receptor-positive T cells to lyse target cells that are susceptible to T-cell mediated cytotoxicity is associated with markedly reduced expression of cell-surface CD8. Targets expressing higher than normal levels of class I major histocompatibility complex target antigen could be lysed, suggesting that reduction in CD8 has decreased T-cell activity for target antigen. We discuss the derivation of T cells that express low levels of CD8 and the role they could play in generating autoimmune diabetes.\r"

Transposon mutagenesis studies in E. coli indicate that the adhesion is a protein with a molecular mass of 36,000 Da. The gene encoding the 36-kDa protein is duplicated in MS11 since two transposon insertions were required to abolish expression of the gene in this bacterium. This protein is present on the surface of the gonococcus and is not associated with the pilus.\r"

  ".W": "We report in this study that, in the presence of magnesium, bath application of micromolar concentrations of glycine have prominent effects on synaptic events and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses in neonatal but not in adult hippocampal slices. Intracellular recordings were made from 71 rat CA3 hippocampal neurons in neonatal slices. In keeping with our earlier study, during the first postnatal week, CA3 neurons exhibited giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). These GDPs are mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting on type A GABA (GABAA) receptors and modulated presynaptically by NMDA receptors. In the majority of cells (18 out of 31), glycine (10-30 microM) increased the frequency of GDPs (from 0.14 to 0.29 Hz). This effect was mimicked by D-serine (10-20 microM) and blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonists D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 microM) and DL-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (50 microM) and by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 microM) but not by strychnine (1 microM). Subthreshold concentrations of glycine (or D-serine) and NMDA, when given together, enhanced synaptic noise and the frequency of GDPs. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM), glycine and D-serine (up to 50 microM) did not modify the NMDA-induced inward currents in CA3 pyramidal cells. However the reduction of NMDA-mediated currents by 7-chlorokynurenate (10-20 microM) was reversed by glycine and D-serine (100-200 microM). In contrast, glycine (up to 100 microM) had no effect on membrane potential, input resistance, or NMDA responses after postnatal day 10. It is concluded that GABA-mediated events are facilitated by glycine acting on presynaptically located NMDA receptors.\r"

Ypt1 antibodies block transport; this inhibition is alleviated by competition with excess purified Ypt1p produced in bacteria. Furthermore, extracts of cells carrying the mutation ypt1-1 are defective in transport, but transport is restored if a cytosolic fraction from wild-type cells is provided. The in vitro transport reaction also requires physiological levels of Ca2+. However, Ypt1p functions independently of Ca2+. First, buffering the free Ca2+ at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 10 microM does not relieve inhibition by Ypt1 antibodies. Second, consumption of a Ca2+-requiring intermediate that accumulates in Ca2+-deficient incubations is not inhibited by anti-Ypt1 antibodies, although completion of transport requires ATP and an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. Thus, Ypt1p and Ca2+ are required at distinct steps.\r"

  ".U": "90115877\r", 
  ".W": "Latent human fibroblast collagenase (HFC) can be activated by a variety of seemingly disparate means. In addition to the well-characterized activation by trypsin and organomercurial compounds, the enzyme can be activated to various extents by surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, by chaotropic ions such as SCN-, by disulfide compounds such as oxidized glutathione, by sulfhydryl alkylating agents such as N-ethylmaleimide, and by oxidants such as NaOCl. The underlying basis for these activations is the modification, exposure, or proteolytic release of the Cys73 residue from its habitat in the latent enzyme where it is thought to be complexed to the active-site zinc atom. This residue is not accessible for reaction with small molar excesses of dithionitrobenzoate in native, latent HFC. However, on addition of EDTA, this residue becomes fully exposed and is quantitatively labeled. All modes of activation of latent HFC are believed to involve the dissociation of Cys73 from the active-site zinc atom and its replacement by water, with the concomitant exposure of the active site. This is thought to be the primary event that precedes the well-known autolytic cleavages that are observed following the appearance of collagenase activity. The dissociation of Cys73 from the zinc atom in the latent enzyme \"switches\" the role of the zinc from a noncatalytic to a catalytic one. This \"cysteine switch\" mechanism of regulation may be applicable to the entire collagenase gene family.\r"

The virus inserts the Escherichia coli lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene into the genome of an infected cell; a histochemical stain marks the progeny of infected cells with a blue precipitate. We had previously shown that individual clones frequently contain diverse neuronal types. Now we asked whether individual clones contain glia as well as neurons. To this end, we constructed a virus in which lacZ is fused to a nuclear localization signal sequence from the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen. Cells infected with this virus are marked with blue nuclei instead of blue somata. In embryos injected with a mixture of the two retroviruses, individual clusters contained cells with only one label type (nuclear or cytoplasmic), thus verifying that clusters of cells were clones. Furthermore, it was possible to immunostain the somata of cells that had blue nuclei, whereas the blue cytoplasmic precipitate hampered immunostaining. Together, these methods allowed us to show that some clones contained neurons (neurofilament-positive) and two types of glia (glutamine synthetase-positive and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive). This result demonstrates the existence of a common progenitor for neurons and glia in optic tectum.\r"

To investigate the immunologic basis of the eosinophil response and directly assess the function of eosinophils in egg-induced pathology, mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni were injected with a monoclonal antibody produced against interleukin 5 (IL-5), a cytokine previously shown to stimulate eosinophil differentiation in vitro. This treatment suppressed the generation of eosinophil myelocyte precursors in the bone marrow and reduced to background levels the numbers of mature eosinophils in the marrow, in circulation, and within acute schistosome egg granulomas. Nevertheless, granulomas in the anti-IL-5-treated/eosinophil-depleted mice at 8 weeks of infection were only marginally smaller than those in animals injected with control monoclonal antibody, and hepatic fibrosis was comparable in the two groups. Additional parameters such as worm burden, egg output, and serum IgE levels were unaltered by the anti-IL-5 treatment. In contrast, infected animals injected with monoclonal antibody against gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) displayed circulating eosinophil levels that were elevated with respect to control mice, possibly because of an enhanced release of mature eosinophils from the marrow, and developed egg granulomas that were indistinguishable in size and cellular composition from those in control animals. Immunologic assays revealed that lymphocytes from acutely infected mice produce large quantities of IL-5 but minimal IFN-gamma when stimulated with either egg antigen or mitogen. Taken together, these results indicate that neither IL-5 nor eosinophils are essential for egg-induced pathology but suggest that lymphocytes that belong to the IL-5-producing TH2 subset predominate during acute infection and may induce granuloma formation by the production of other cytokines.\r"

Formylmethionyl peptides have been shown to comprise a significant portion of the chemotactic activity in bacterial culture filtrates; however, not all of the chemotactic agents in bacterial culture filtrates are formylated peptides. To examine whether nonformylated peptides derived from bacteria could act as chemotactic agents, we studied several nonformylated hepta- and octapeptide Enterococcus faecalis-derived sex pheromones, their modified derivatives, and their competitive inhibitors for activation of rat peritoneal neutrophils. Several of these peptides, in particular cAM373 and cPD1, proved to be potent chemotactic agents in submicromolar concentrations as well as inducers of lysosomal granule enzyme secretion. Moreover, the more biologically active peptides were able to compete with fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe for binding to the formyl peptide receptor. These studies demonstrate that the formylmethionyl moiety may be an absolute requirement only for the binding of di- and tripeptides to the formyl peptide receptor. Larger peptides that may have or that may allow for additional contact points between the peptide and receptor may require N-formylation only relatively. Indeed, by removing this structural restraint, the formyl peptide receptor may interact with an unlimited number of peptide fragments of both infectious and host origins to then modulate neutrophil responses to infection and inflammation.\r"

The effectiveness of antibiotic therapy is likewise difficult to assess. Serial computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained in 11 consecutive patients with malignant external otitis at time of diagnosis and periodically after conclusion of antibiotic therapy. All patients demonstrated abnormalities of the external auditory canal, with or without bone destruction. Soft tissue or fluid in the middle ear and mastoid, around the eustachian tube, and in the parapharyngeal space (both pre- and poststyloid) was seen in greater than 50% of the cases. While remineralization of bone was not seen, soft-tissue disease improved dramatically, and recurrence or persistence could be corroborated by detection of more extensive soft-tissue changes. By delineating the extra- and intracranial extent of disease, serial CT scans enable one to make the diagnosis, determine the extent of infection, document recurrence, exclude progression, and confirm resolution of malignant external otitis.\r"

As a group, patients with a segmental appearance on the pretherapy lung scans had more improvement in the perfusion reduction score than patients with a nonsegmental appearance (P less than .005). However, the correlation between segmental appearance and a favorable response to thrombolytic therapy was not strong enough to allow use of this appearance in the selection of patients for therapy.\r"

Using this model, data on HIV infection from published studies, and certain assumptions about blood donor behavior, we estimate that the probability of detecting an additional HIV-infective blood component is approximately 1 in 4,860,000. If this estimate is correct, adding HIV-Ag testing would prevent approximately 4 cases of primary transfusion-transmitted HIV infection annually in the United States. After adjustments for the median incubation period for AIDS, and for mortality due to primary illnesses, this estimate represents prevention of approximately 1 case of AIDS per year, within the 4 years after transfusion. A primary advantage of this model is its adaptability for recalculating cost-benefit analyses if more sensitive tests for HIV infection become available. In addition, we propose that comparing the anticipated costs and benefits of HIV-Ag testing to other possible uses of these funds should be an important factor in assessing the desirability of HIV-Ag testing.\r"

A regional distribution of neuropeptide Y was found; highest concentrations being present in the ureterovesical junction. Throughout the ureter, neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerve fibers were identified to surround the blood vessels and a few plexuses of neuropeptide Y-containing nerves were present within the muscle layers. Neuropeptide Y was not present within ganglion cells. Treatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine resulted in a significant reduction of neuropeptide Y concentrations in the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the ureter. This depletion in extractable neuropeptide Y was associated with morphologic changes typical of axonal degeneration of the neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers.\r"

  ".W": "Usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) is a chronic pulmonary process with a characteristic peripheral fibrotic pattern on gross pathologic lung sections and CT scans. This condition is often idiopathic, but asbestosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma may cause the same peripheral fibrosis in the lungs. UIP is associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary neoplasms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the size of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with UIP in whom no evidence was seen of malignancy or current active infection. CT scans of 14 patients (12 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and two with collagen vascular disorders) were assessed for lymph node location (American Thoracic Society mediastinal map) and size. In 13 of 14 patients, nodes measured greater than threshold size values. Nodes as large as 20 x 30 mm were identified in three patients. Nodal sites 10R, 4R, 2R, 5, and 6 were most commonly abnormal. We conclude that increase in the size of mediastinal lymph nodes as shown on chest CT scans is common in patients with UIP, occurs without superimposed infectious or malignant complications, and is thus presumably part of the chronic inflammatory process. Consequently, lymphadenopathy in these patients does not suggest that they have lung cancer also.\r"

For this reason, we reviewed CT records of 353 patients undergoing initial evaluation of lung cancer for the presence of calcification within the tumor, both to document this finding and to estimate its prevalence. Twenty patients (6%) whose records indicated that CT showed calcification were identified, and their chest radiographs and CT scans were analyzed. Patients were included in the study if calcium was seen within the tumor on noncontrast pretreatment CT scans and if pathologic data were available. There were 15 lung and five mediastinal tumors. Fourteen were 5 cm or greater in diameter; three were between 3 and 5 cm, and three were 2 cm or smaller. Cell types of the tumors included small-cell carcinoma (eight patients), squamous cell carcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma (four patients), and undifferentiated carcinoma (one patient). Patterns of calcification were amorphous (eight patients), punctate (10 patients), and reticular (two patients). Extent of tumor calcification and distribution (central, peripheral, or diffuse) did not correlate with cell type or size of the lesion. The visualization of calcium on chest radiographs and CT scans does not alone exclude the diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

This new film has been improved when compared with earlier T-Mat M film, including the introduction of an inert dye to reduce light crossover to essentially 0%. Mammogram pairs made with the dual-emulsion film combination and the standard single-emulsion film combination were obtained in 50 patients otherwise undergoing routine mammography. The image pairs were randomized and evaluated by three radiologists who used a three-point scale (better, same, or worse). Each pair was evaluated with regard to parenchymal contrast, sharpness, and latitude, as well as the number and sharpness of calcifications (n = 19) and sharpness of masses (n = 12) when present. All three observers found the dual-emulsion film combination to be better than or the same as the standard with regard to parenchymal sharpness (94-100%), the number and sharpness of calcifications (98-100%), and sharpness of masses (100%). Two observers found the dual-emulsion film combination to be significantly worse (p less than .05) than the standard with respect to parenchymal contrast (72%, 86%), and all three observers rated it significantly worse for film latitude (14 to 42%). Our results suggest that this new dual-emulsion film combination that allows mammography to be performed with less radiation exposure can be used without loss of image quality.\r"

The neoplasms of the internal viscera and head and neck were relatively advanced when detected. The neoplasms of the skin, vulva, uterine cervix, and urinary bladder were low-grade malignant tumors. Most of the cyclosporine-induced malignant lesions were lymphomas. The lymphomas in cyclosporine-treated recipients were characterized by early appearance after transplantation; more extensive organ involvement; multiple, homogeneous solid lesions without central low density on CT and sonography; and regression after reduction of cyclosporine dose. We conclude that malignant tumors occurring after transplantation are often advanced and that lymphoma induced by cyclosporine has characteristic features.\r"

A statistically significant association was found between three sonographic findings and perforation: loculated pericecal fluid, prominent pericecal fat, and circumferential loss of the submucosal layer of the appendix. No single finding had a specificity greater than 59%. By using a combination of one or more findings, the overall sensitivity of sonography for the diagnosis of perforation was 86%. The specificity, however, was only 60%. Our results suggest that in patients without a sonographically visible appendix, recognition of loculated pericecal fluid and prominent pericecal fat may be a useful indirect clue to the diagnosis of perforating appendicitis.\r"

Limitations in the CT diagnosis were related to (1) marked thickening of the colonic wall, between 1 and 3 cm in cross section simulating colonic neoplasm (all patients); (2) inability to visualize small amounts of fibropurulent exudate in the absence of pericolic inflammatory changes (eight patients); (3) failure to detect discrete intramural abscess (five patients). Resected surgical specimens available in 12 cases proved that colonic wall thickening was caused by muscular hypertrophy and various degrees of submucosal inflammation, edema, fibrosis, or focal organized inflammatory tissue. Contrast enema was useful in 10 out of 13 patients by excluding carcinoma of the colon and confirming the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis.\r"

The procedure averaged 98 +/- 32 min total time in the lithotripsy suite. This included an average of 22 +/- 6 min before the treatment, 70 +/- 28 min for administration of shock waves, and 6 +/- 2 min after the treatment. The time required to deliver the shock waves did not correlate with patient age, sex, or weight; the number of gallstones; or the number or date of the treatment. However, a trend was seen toward an association between shorter treatment times and larger stone volumes. On the average, the administration of shock waves was interrupted every 48 shock waves for various reasons. Electronically changing the imaging plane of the in-line sonographic transducer to retarget the stone in the focal zone was by far the most frequent reason for interrupting shock-wave delivery, averaging 56 shock waves between changes. We conclude that extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy of gallstones is a time consuming and technically demanding procedure that requires continuous monitoring and frequent interruption in order to optimize targeting and fragmentation of the stone(s) while maintaining the patient's comfort.\r"

  ".U": "90119337\r", 
  ".W": "The differentiation of a uterine leiomyoma from other solid pelvic masses on sonography is usually straightforward. Occasionally, the sonographic appearance of a pedunculated uterine leiomyoma may simulate that of a solid adnexal mass. The purpose of this study was to determine if MR imaging adds specificity to the diagnosis of indeterminate solid pelvic masses visualized with sonography. Nineteen patients were imaged with MR after sonography revealed the presence of a solid pelvic mass adjacent to the uterus but could not be used to determine whether the mass was a leiomyoma or some other type of tumor. The diagnostic criteria for a leiomyoma on MR imaging included (1) the presence of a mass adjacent to the uterus and (2) a mass that was predominantly low signal intensity or isointense compared with normal myometrium on T1-weighted images and predominantly low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In 11 of 13 patients, the masses that met these MR criteria for leiomyoma were proved to be uterine leiomyomas at surgery. Another mass that met the criteria was shown to be a leiomyoma in the broad ligament; the other was an ovarian fibroma. Of the six cases that did not meet the MR criteria for the diagnosis of leiomyoma, three were proved to be degenerated fibroids, one was squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, and two were ovarian malignant tumors. Because leiomyomas often have an MR appearance that is distinct from that of solid pelvic malignant tumors, MR imaging can be useful for the diagnosis of some indeterminate solid pelvic masses.\r"

  ".W": "A study was performed to determine the frequency of periosteal reaction associated with chondroblastoma, to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of the periosteal reaction, and to postulate the clinical importance of this radiographic observation. Two hundred fourteen histologically proved chondroblastomas were reviewed and observed for the presence or absence of periosteal reaction and for radiographic changes that might explain the cause of the periosteal reaction. A similar review was performed on 30 other epiphyseally centered lesions of various causes. A distinctive thick, solid periosteal reaction distal to the chondroblastoma was present in 47% of all chondroblastomas and 57% of chondroblastomas present in long bones (excluding the greater trochanter). No periosteal reaction was observed in any of the 30 epiphyseally centered lesions of other causes. When available for observation, plain films showed inflammatory changes in the joint surrounding the chondroblastoma, bone scintigraphy showed tracer uptake similar to that observed in inflammatory lesions and aggressive neoplasms, and MR images showed change in the marrow surrounding the chondroblastoma consistent with edema. This suggests an inflammatory reaction to the chondroblastoma, rather than mechanical stress across a weakened epiphysis, as the cause of the periostitis. We conclude that frequently the chondroblastoma produces a distinctive thick solid or layered periosteal response distant from the lesion along the diametaphyseal shaft. Observation of this unique periosteal response may help to distinguish chondroblastoma from other epiphyseally centered lesions.\r"

Twenty-five patients had a palpable mass. In an additional 13 patients an occult mass lesion was suspected as the cause of distal ulnar neuropathy. Twenty-two mass lesions (16 benign and six malignant) were detected by MR. All were correctly predicted to be benign or malignant. In nine (56%) of the 16 benign mass lesions, the specific diagnosis was suggested. In the remaining seven benign mass lesions and in the six malignant tumors, the MR findings were not specific enough to permit a diagnosis. Of the 14 patients referred for evaluation of a distal ulnar neuropathy, an occult ganglionic cyst compressing the ulnar nerve was revealed with MR imaging in three. MR imaging of the hand and wrist is accurate in the detection of mass lesions and can correctly distinguish benign from malignant tumors in the majority of cases. Specific diagnoses can be made in certain benign lesions. Occult mass lesions can be confirmed or excluded as the cause of distal ulnar neuropathy with MR imaging.\r"

Severe arthralgias recently have been reported as a significant side effect, and the cause of pain is unknown. Because interleukin-2 is an immune modulator, we reviewed the 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate scintigrams in nine patients who had developed shoulder arthralgias while receiving interleukin-2 for metastatic melanoma. In eight of the patients, the scintigrams showed diffuse increased uptake of radionuclide in the shoulders. Four patients had radiographs of their shoulders, all of which were normal. Bone scintigraphy in patients receiving interleukin-2 as immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma shows increased radionuclide activity in the shoulders. This process may relate to the role of interleukin-2 as a mediator in the inflammatory response.\r"

The duration of the disease at the time of the MR examination ranged from 1 to 58 months (mean, 18 months). A relationship was identified between the pattern of bone marrow alteration noted on long TR/TE MR sequences and the scintigraphic stage and clinical course of the disease. The dimensions of the osteonecrotic region could be identified as well or better on the short TR/TE MR images than on the radiographs in all patients. MR imaging also afforded evaluation of the hyaline cartilage overlying the osteonecrotic lesion, revealing secondary osteoarthrosis in seven patients. We conclude that MR imaging in patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee may provide information of value for determining the prognosis of the disease.\r"

We performed MR imaging and arthrography in 10 normal wrists of fresh cadavers ranging in age from 48 to 71 years, and compared the appearance of the interosseous ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex with findings on anatomic sections of the joints. In six of the specimens, relatively T1-weighted MR images, 800/20 (TR/TE), preceded three-compartment digital arthrography performed with standard contrast material. In the other four specimens, arthrography, using an MR solution of iodinated contrast material mixed with cupric sulfate and gelatin, was performed before MR imaging. This was done to mimic the intraarticular fluid that might be seen in an injured wrist. MR allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate ligament in eight of 10 cases. Consistent MR visualization of the lunotriquetral ligament was difficult. Three-compartment digital arthrography allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments in all 10 cases. We concluded that MR is useful but inferior to arthrography in the evaluation of interosseous ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex.\r"

With 80% or more area collapse as a criterion for the diagnosis of laryngomalacia and 50% or more for tracheomalacia, six patients had tracheomalacia, one had laryngomalacia, and two had both. Tracheomalacia was focal in four patients and diffuse, involving the thoracic trachea, in the other four. Associated bronchomalacia was present in two patients. The site and degree of abnormality were verified by endoscopy in five of nine patients. The degree of tracheal collapse did not always correlate with the size of the esophageal pouch or with the site of the tracheo-esophageal fistula. These findings support the concept that the larynx and/or tracheal walls are often abnormal in symptomatic infants with esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and airway obstruction. Ultrafast CT was a reliable technique for detecting and assessing the site, extent, severity, and dynamics of airway collapse in five of seven symptomatic infants with congenital tracheoesophageal anomalies when the imaging findings were compared with endoscopic findings and previously published normal standards.\r"

Medulloblastoma was the most frequent primary tumor (8/25, 32%). Four subgroups of loculated patterns were identified. Type A included mass(es) limited to the subarachnoid space without obvious direct parenchymal infiltration; this pattern occurred in 12 patients, of whom five had associated diffuse pattern. Type B was characterized by mass(es) still predominantly in the subarachnoid space but with minor transpinal parenchymal infiltration; this pattern was found in five patients. Type C comprised subarachnoid mass(es) with marked transpinal extension mimicking parenchymal lesion; this pattern was observed in three patients. Type D consisted of subarachnoid mass(es) growing along the perineural CSF space; this pattern was noted in two patients. Additionally, two patients presented with combined A and C patterns, and one patient had a combined B and C pattern. More than half the patients (14/25, 56%) presented with a single lesion. The most frequent locations were the suprasellar cistern, ventricular walls, and lateral recesses of the fourth ventricle, Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted MR images appeared best for demonstrating the site and extent of disease. Recognition of the loculated patterns of leptomeningeal metastases, which are less common than the diffuse pattern, is important to radiologists and clinicians for correct diagnosis and proper management of patients with this disease.\r"

The reversal sign, a striking CT finding, probably represents a diffuse, anoxic/ischemic cerebral injury. CT features of the reversal sign are diffusely decreased density of cerebral cortical gray and white matter with a decreased or lost gray/white matter interface, or reversal of the gray/white matter densities and relatively increased density of the thalami, brainstem, and cerebellum. Twenty children with the reversal sign were retrospectively analyzed. We divided the patients into three groups: (1) acute reversal, (2) intermediate group, and (3) chronic reversal. There were nine cases of trauma (seven of child abuse); nine hypoxia/anoxia incidents (birth asphyxia, drowning, status epilepticus); one bacterial meningitis; and one degenerative encephalitis. All acute- and intermediate-group patients had respiratory problems requiring ventilator support and intensive care. In five of seven patients who died, autopsy findings were consistent with anoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. Surviving patients have profound neurologic deficits with severe developmental delay. The CT reversal sign carries a poor prognosis and indicates irreversible brain damage.\r"

These lesions most often involved the globus pallidus and internal capsules in a bilateral and symmetric fashion, and extended across the anterior commissure resulting in a \"dumbbell\" configuration. Smaller and less prominent foci of increased signal also were present on corresponding T2-weighted images. These lesions did not exhibit mass effect, edema, or enhancement with gadolinium-DTPA. They were not visible on CT (performed in two patients) and demonstrated no progression during a 2-year interval in three patients. Their signal characteristics and morphology suggest that they represent heterotopias containing Schwann cells and/or melanin deposits. Migrational abnormalities of these neural crest derivatives are known to occur in neurofibromatosis, and the presence of such heterotopias has been documented pathologically in patients with this disorder. While recent reports discuss foci of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images in patients with neurofibromatosis, signal abnormalities on T1-weighted images have not yet been described. When lesions characterized by similar signal as well as morphologic characteristics are encountered on MR, the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis should be considered.\r"

This sequence maintains adequate signal-to-noise and image contrast similar to gradient-recalled echo two-dimensional Fourier transformation (2DFT) imaging. Thirty patients with radiculopathy were examined with 3DFT gradient-recalled echo imaging. The data set consisted of 60 contiguous 1.5- to 2.0-mm-thick axial slices with a total coverage of 9 to 12 cm. In 10 patients, comparison was made with 4-mm-thick axial T1-weighted spin-echo 2DFT or gradient-recalled echo 2DFT studies. With the use of a volume acquisition, adequate signal-to-noise and image contrast similar to T2-weighted gradient-recalled echo 2DFT acquisitions were obtainable. Coverage was improved despite the use of thinner sections without interslice gap. Thin-section 3DFT provided superior detail of acquired foraminal and spinal canal stenosis and disk morphology. Limitations included increased sensitivity to patient motion and \"wraparound\" artifact in the slice-select direction. Overall, diagnostic confidence was improved with 3DFT owing to the reduction of partial volume artifact. We have adopted this technique as the primary screening method for diagnosing cervical radiculopathy.\r"

The types of shunts examined included portacaval, five; mesocaval, eight; distal splenorenal (Warren), 14; and mesoatrial, five. Sonography was performed without knowledge of the status of the shunt, although the type of shunt was known before beginning the study. The sonographic studies were evaluated to determine their sensitivity and specificity on the basis of a prospective comparison with angiography or MR imaging (22 cases). The possible advantages of color Doppler over duplex Doppler sonography in evaluating portosystemic shunts were also investigated, as was the ability of color Doppler sonography to image specifically the shunt anastomoses. Color Doppler sonography successfully inferred shunt patency (17 cases) or thrombosis (five cases) in all 22 shunts for which correlative imaging was available (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 100%). In comparing duplex with color Doppler sonography in all 32 shunts, the two techniques were almost equally effective in establishing patency in portacaval, mesocaval, and mesoatrial shunts. Duplex Doppler sonography, however, provided useful diagnostic information in only four of 14 splenorenal shunts. Color Doppler correctly inferred patency or thrombosis in all 14. Among all 32 shunts, the anastomosis was shown clearly by color Doppler in 23, probably in four, and not all in five. Our results suggest that color Doppler sonography is an excellent method for the evaluation of all varieties of surgically created portosystemic shunts. In particular, color Doppler sonography appears to be superior to duplex Doppler sonography in imaging splenorenal communications.\r"

  ".W": "Color Doppler flow imaging with linear-array transducers was performed in 130 extremities in 91 patients with suspected upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis. Thrombi were detected in 39 studies (30%). Eighty-four patients had either imaging examinations (22 studies comprising venography in 20 patients, CT in one, and MR imaging in one) or clinical follow-up (99 studies) for correlation. In studies with imaging correlation, the sensitivity of the Doppler studies was 78% and the specificity was 92%. There were two false-negative examinations in which the proximal subclavian vein either could not be imaged or the anatomy was distorted. There was one false-positive color Doppler diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in a case of partial obstruction of the subclavian vein caused by extrinsic compression. There were no known additional errors in color Doppler imaging in patients who had clinical follow-up. Four cases of isolated superior vena cava or proximal innominate vein obstruction were missed by color Doppler imaging. Color Doppler flow imaging is an accurate, noninvasive method for the evaluation of upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis. Other imaging tests may be required when the color Doppler study is negative and central venous thrombosis is suspected.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients were examined with both abdominal CT and 67Ga scintigraphy for suspected synthetic vascular graft infection. Two patients were studied twice, yielding a total of 18 paired tests. A total of 25 grafts were analyzed. The results of CT and 67Ga scintigraphy were compared for grafts in specific anatomic locations including the retroperitoneum, groin, and abdominal wall, and for combined sites. When all locations were considered as a group, CT had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 72%; 67Ga scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 94%. 67Ga scintigraphy proved to be more specific than CT (p less than .05) for combined sites, but no significant difference in sensitivities was demonstrated, possibly because of the small number of infected grafts in our study. No differences in sensitivities or specificities were statistically significant when grafts in individual anatomic sites were analyzed. Since no significant difference between the sensitivities of CT and 67Ga scanning was demonstrated in our study, although the number of infected grafts was small, CT is recommended as the initial examination when graft infection is suspected because it can be performed immediately. 67Ga scintigraphy remains an important complementary test, adding specificity to the diagnostic workup.\r"

We performed sonography on 83 patients with palpable cervical lymph node metastases in the region of the carotid bifurcation to determine the relationship of the metastases to the carotid artery and jugular vein. In all patients, the sonographic results were proved by surgery. The wall of the carotid artery was hypo-echogenic in 11 of 12 patients with surgically proved tumor invasion of the artery. Four results were false-positive. Palpation or swallowing during real-time scanning showed mobility of the tumor relative to the wall of the artery in 47 patients (57%). In these patients, tumor invasion could be excluded. Bilateral compression or invasion of the internal jugular vein was identified correctly with sonography in all five patients in whom this was confirmed surgically. These results suggest that real-time sonography is a valuable method for determining the relationship between cervical lymph node metastases and the carotid artery and jugular vein.\r"

Epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary fish oil can reduce the development of cardiovascular disease in humans. Data are limited but suggest that laboratory animals, normal volunteers, and patients with hyperlipidemia show similar responses to the consumption of fish oil. The major effect of dietary fish oil on serum lipoproteins is a reduction in plasma triglyceride levels, with inconsistent effects on plasma cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. Dietary fish oil induces a significant reduction of platelet aggregation associated with a prolonged bleeding time. This antithrombotic effect may be partially related to a decreased thromboxane A2 and to an increased prostacyclin level. Dietary fish oil may also have anti-inflammatory and anti-immunologic effects through an elevation of prostaglandins and a reduction in the level of leukotriene B4. Recent experimental data suggest that either fish oil or verapamil can bring on a regression in atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits put on a normal diet; however, there was no additive effect of the combination of these agents. Overall, data suggest that fish oil may have a role in attenuating the development of atherosclerosis.\r"

Immunoreactivity for ANP was observed in the subendocardial cardiac cells of infarcted as well as noninfarcted segments of the left ventricles in all patients with myocardial infarction. In a case of biventricular infarcts, the subendocardial cardiac cells of the right ventricle were also stained. In a case of ventricular aneurysm, the viable hypertrophied cardiac cells were immunoreactive for ANP throughout the wall of the aneurysm. Immunoreactivity for ANP, however, was not detected in the working ventricular cardiac cells in any of the control subjects. Because ANP improves left ventricular function by reducing both preload and afterload, the appearance of ANP in the ventricles in patients with myocardial infarction may be one of the manifestations of the compensatory mechanism.\r"

Echocardiographic tracings, repeat determinations of mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (MPAWP) and mean right atrial pressure, and blood sampling from the pulmonary artery for measurements of ANF were performed at baseline, during atrial pacing (pacing rate of 125 beats/min for 5 minutes), and 5 minutes after the pacing protocol was completed. Baseline ANF levels were closely related to right atrial pressure (r = 0.89; p less than 0.001) and increased markedly after atrial pacing from 205.6 +/- 39.8 (SEM) to 343.9 +/- 57.9 (SEM) pg/ml. A similar pacing-induced increase was shown for MPAWP and left atrial size. Our data indicate that pacing-induced increases in atrial distention and intracavitary pressure further stimulate release of ANF. However, an independent effect of frequency of atrial pacing on plasma ANF in humans could not be identified.\r"

  ".W": "In 92 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator 2.3 +/- 1.2 hours after the onset of chest pain, echocardiography was performed at 11 +/- 14 hours (early) and, in 49 patients, again at 13 +/- 7 weeks (late). Infarct location and the left ventricular wall motion score index--the average score (normal = 1, hypokinetic = 2, akinetic = 3, dyskinetic = 4) for 20 segments--were determined by 2 observers unaware of clinical, angiographic or electrocardiographic data. Concordance between noninvasive infarct location by electrocardiography or echocardiography and infarct-related artery at angiography 4 +/- 2 days later (n = 85) was 76 and 81%, respectively. The early wall motion score index was worse for anterior (1.8 +/- 0.4) versus inferior (1.3 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.0001) or posterior-lateral (1.6 +/- 0.2, p = 0.0003) infarcts. Overall, the wall motion score index improved from early to late echocardiography (n = 49, 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.3 +/- 0.3, p = 0.0008). However, improvement was confined to those with time to treatment less than or equal to 2 hours (n = 22, 1.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.2 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.0001), and evidence of reperfusion at angiography (n = 38, 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.2 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.0001). The decrease in the wall motion score index was related to a decrease in the number of adjacent involved segments (5.5 +/- 3.0 to 3.7 +/- 3.9/patient, p = 0.0006). Thus, echocardiography early after AMI identifies infarct location. Improvement in regional wall motion is seen after early treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.\r"

Hemodynamics and left ventricular (LV) function (by digital subtraction angiography) were measured at baseline and during rapid atrial pacing (mean peak heart rate 135 beats/min), which induced chest pain or electrocardiographic changes in all patients. After a control pacing period, intravenous isradipine (0.01 mg/kg, n = 16) or placebo (n = 8) was administered in a double-blind fashion and all variables were measured again at baseline and during pacing to the same maximum heart rate. Before isradipine was given, pacing had no effect on systolic blood pressure, while increasing diastolic blood pressure (68 +/- 8 to 87 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) and LV end-diastolic pressure measured in the immediate postpacing period (13 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.03) and decreasing LV end-diastolic volume index (59 +/- 18 to 40 +/- 12 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), stroke volume index (37 +/- 11 to 23 +/- 10 ml/m2, p less than 0.0001), ejection fraction (0.64 +/- 0.07 to 0.53 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.0003) and percent regional shortening in 4 of 5 myocardial wall segments. During pacing after isradipine, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower, ejection fraction was higher and percent regional shortening decreased in only 2 of 5 myocardial segments. In comparison to placebo, isradipine increased baseline heart rate, ejection fraction and stroke volume index while it decreased arterial pressure and end-systolic volume index before the second pacing period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These unfortunate results were especially surprising in that the CAST population represented patients in whom the risk of arrhythmic death was only moderate and the risk of proarrhythmia was thought to be low. In contrast, the arrhythmic death rate of the CAST placebo group was unusually low, to the extent that it paralleled the arrhythmic death rate in previous clinical trials of patients surviving myocardial infarction with no ventricular arrhythmia. The excessive arrhythmic death rate in patients taking encainide and flecainide occurred over the duration of the CAST, implying a proarrhythmic effect that may be due to mechanisms that are unique in this population, and thus challenging traditional concepts of proarrhythmia. The existing knowledge regarding the proarrhythmic and negative inotropic effects of encainide and flecainide are reviewed. The previous pharmaceutical database experience with these 2 antiarrhythmic drugs exceeded 3,000 patients; however, there was no indication of this serious proarrhythmic effect. In contrast, the CAST population taking encainide and flecainide totaled only 725 patients who were followed for 10 months and had an extremely high proarrhythmic event rate. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The results of the CAST emphasize the power of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to uncover previously unsuspected benefits or liabilities of traditional therapies.\r"

  ".W": "For purposes of clinical management, ventricular arrhythmias have been divided into risk categories of benign, prognostically important (potentially malignant) and malignant. Benign arrhythmias occur in the setting of structurally normal hearts and do not require therapy unless associated with debilitating symptoms. Malignant arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation deserve aggressive therapy to prevent recurrence. Arrhythmias occurring in the presence of organic heart disease (often ischemic disease) are frequently asymptomatic but prognostically important as a risk factor for sudden death or cardiac arrest. The common empiric practice to treat such arrhythmias (by about 40 to 50% of cardiologists in the United States) needs to be reassessed in the face of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. For malignant arrhythmias, class IA agents (procainamide and quinidine) continue to be the standard of treatment, and class IB agents (e.g., mexiletine) may be used as alternative or additive therapy. Class IC agents are used as second-line therapy, especially in the setting of ischemic heart disease. Class III therapy with amiodarone is reserved for refractory patients because of potential toxicity. Sotalol, a new class II-III agent, may become a first-line drug. For prognostically important arrhythmias, beta blockers remain the agents of choice, class IC agents are contraindicated, and class IA or IB drugs, or both, should be used conservatively (i.e., only for symptomatic arrhythmias). For symptomatic but benign arrhythmias requiring treatment, beta blockers are safe although not always effective. Class IA, IB and IC agents may then be considered. In these patients, the proarrhythmic potential of quinidine and class IC agents remains a concern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Five male adult home patients were studied in a randomized order under continuous (24 h/d) and nocturnal cyclic (15 h/d) isocaloric, isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN). They received 2626 +/- 265 total kcal/d as 60% dextrose and 40% lipids; the 3-h lipid infusion was followed by the dextrose amino acid infusion on both regimens. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry during four periods on the fourth day of each regimen. During cyclic TPN net lipogenesis occurred with a nonproteic respiratory quotient (npRQ) greater than 1 during dextrose amino acid infusion followed by net lipolysis with an npRQ less than 1 during the nonnourishing phase. In contrast, during continuous TPN net lipogenesis persisted with an npRQ greater than 1 over the 21 h of dextrose amino acid infusion. During the 3-h lipid infusion, fat oxidation was observed during both regimens but was more pronounced during cyclic TPN (p less than 0.05). As a consequence, 24-h lipid oxidation was higher and 24-h dextrose utilization lower during cyclic vs continuous TPN (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that cyclic TPN when alternating between substrate storage and oxidation, mimics the physiological pattern of oral feeding.\r"

Their effect on the immune system is controversial, however. In this randomized, prospective study we investigated the possible differences between the effect of TPN with LCTs or medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) on T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Our study included 15 normal subjects, 20 patients receiving glucose-based TPN, and 40 patients receiving glucose-fat-based TPN. In the last group 20 patients received TPN that included LCTs and 20 received 50% MCTs and 50% LCTs. T-lymphocyte subpopulations, including total T cells and T-helper, T-suppressor, and NK cells, as well as the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells were determined before and 10 d after initiation of TPN. We found a significant decrease in the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells in the LCT group although no such difference was detected in the MCT-LCT group. No difference whatever was found in total T cells and helper, suppressor, and NK cells.\r"

  ".W": "Early weaning of piglets induces a rapid decrease in the concentration of all plasma lipoproteins within 2 d. The decline was more progressive when 20% saturated fatty acid (lard) (SF) was added to the diet; saturated fatty acid was more effective than unsaturated fatty acid (sunflower oil) (UF). Medium-chain triglycerides had no protective effect. Intestinal synthesis of apoprotein AI was twofold higher in preweaning piglets than in adults (12.9% of total synthesis vs 5.9%, p less than 0.01) when measured in intestinal mucosa. On day 4 of weaning, synthesis was still at the preweaning level in all groups but on day 7 was maintained only by the SF diet (11.7%). We conclude that long-chain lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, prevent a decrease in lipoproteins at weaning, mainly by maintaining intestinal apo AI synthesis at a high level.\r"

The two groups differed in that JHH infants had shorter gestations but were older when studied. Fecal 13C loss after [13C]glucose administration did not differ between the two groups. Compared with glucose, the metabolism of lactose appeared to involve more malabsorption and colonic fermentation in JHH infants than in CCH infants and resulted in higher fecal losses of substrate carbon. Maturation appeared to involve increased proximal intestinal absorption and greater retention of absorbed carbohydrate. Simultaneous absorption of substrate from the small and large intestine may limit the usefulness of breath tests for 13C in the premature infant.\r"

All patients had had sustained elevations in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (sGPT) levels for more than 6 months and were proven to have chronic hepatitis by liver biopsy. alpha-Interferon (IFN-alpha) or beta-interferon (IFN-beta) was administered in low doses of 3 to 6 mega international units (MIU) daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsies were taken from 13 CH-NANB and 14 CH-B subjects just before and immediately after treatment, and histological findings were assessed by the histology activity index (HAI) score. SGPT levels decreased much more rapidly and markedly in CH-NANB than in CH-B during IFN therapy (p less than 0.01). The HAI score decreased 3.5 points in CH-NANB and 1.0 point in CH-B between pretreatment and posttreatment. Serum beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG) increased in both types of chronic hepatitis during treatment, but the rate of elevation was significantly less in CH-NANB than in CH-B (p less than 0.001). beta 2-MG expression on hepatocytes stained by the PAP method was almost identical in CH-NANB before and after treatment, whereas it increased steadily in CH-B. The serum 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase level increased in both types of hepatitis on IFN administration. These results suggest that, in IFN treatment for CH-NANB, the antiviral actions of IFNs may play a very important role in reducing the activity of chronic hepatitis.\r"

Each patient received two doses of the agent, as well as an infusion of placebo. Six different doses were tested ranging from 0.015-0.300 microgram/kg/min. The infusions lasted for 2 hours and were flanked by both baseline and recovery periods. There was a significant effect of placebo on urinary sodium and chloride excretion rates but no effect on urine flow rate. In response to anaritide, the urine flow rate increased at 0.03, 0.06, 0.075, and 0.100 microgram/kg/min. The sodium and chloride excretion rates increased at all doses except the highest dose. There was no definite effect of anaritide on urinary potassium, calcium, and phosphate excretion rates. There was also no significant effect on creatinine clearance. The mean arterial pressure decreased in response to the 0.060, 0.075, and 0.100 microgram/kg/min doses. In addition, five of the patients receiving the highest dose (0.300 microgram/kg/min) had decreases in their systolic pressures to 90 mm Hg or less. In conclusion, anaritide is natriuretic and diuretic in patients with cirrhosis complicated by ascites and/or edema. Its effect, however, on arterial pressure may limit its therapeutic potential in this patient population.\r"

Both HETEs and HPETEs induced SCEs in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 microM. At each concentration, HETEs were more effective in producing SCEs than the corresponding HPETEs. Each of the isomeric forms used were equally effective in producing genetic damage. Antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase and mannitol) were protective suggesting an intermediate role for the hydroxyl radical. Iron chelation by desferrioxamine suppressed SCE induction by 45% and an additional 33% inhibition was observed upon the addition of the calcium chelator EGTA.\r"

One eye of each rabbit was treated with a 1% trifluorothymidine solution daily, starting on the third day after inoculation. The direct immunofluorescence assay showed lower sensitivity for herpes simplex virus detection than viral isolation in tissue culture for both untreated and partially treated eyes. The Herpchek ELISA demonstrated similar sensitivity to tissue culture in detecting herpes simplex virus in untreated eyes. In the treated group, however, the Herpchek ELISA showed a higher percentage of eyes positive for herpes simplex virus than did viral isolation in tissue culture. After the initiation of antiviral therapy, eyes that no longer harbor infectious virus that can be isolated in tissue culture may remain herpes simplex virus antigen-positive and thus be more amenable to laboratory diagnosis using the rapid ELISA method.\r"

  ".W": "The normal neuromuscular synapse is formed by the intimate association of nerve endings, postsynaptic end-plate foldings in the muscle fiber, and nonmyelinating Schwann cells (SC) sealing the synaptic ramifications. Because SC have been recognized recently to have an immunogenic potential inducible to present protein autoantigens to autoimmune T lymphocytes, and considering their close proximity to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-bearing postsynaptic membranes, presentation of soluble and membrane vesicle-bound AChR to appropriate T cells was investigated. Short-term monolayer cultures of SC isolated from neonatal rat sciatic nerves, as well as cells of an immortalized SC line of similar origin, were fully able to present the relevant molecular epitopes to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) compatible AChR-specific T line lymphocytes immunogenically. Presentation of AChR was restricted by RT1.B (I-A) MHC class II products. Both types of cultured rat SC were inducible to expression of MHC class I and II products, and they were able to phagocytose AChR-enriched membrane vesicles preferentially. In contrast, phagocytosis of latex particles by SC was negligible. These data qualify perisynaptic SC as potential presenter cells of autoimmunogenic AChR in myasthenia gravis. Thus, SC may play a critical and as-yet unpredicted regulatory role in the cellular pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis.\r"

In these enzyme-deficient animals, lysosomes, distended by fine fibrillar and granular storage material, are particularly prominent in the macrophage system but also occur in other tissues including the skeletal and central nervous systems. The clinical and pathologic abnormalities in these mutant mice closely parallel those identified in humans with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Therefore, these mice provide a well-defined genetic system for the analysis of the pathophysiology of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII, which has many features in common with the other MPS. The mutant mice provide an attractive animal model to test potential therapies for lysosomal storage disease.\r"

The results obtained show that TNF alpha enhances the effect of tau IFN on the expression of class I and II MHC antigens. IL-1 alpha did not affect tau IFN-induced class I expression but did inhibit tau IFN-induced class II expression. Finally, TNF alpha-induced class I MHC expression was inhibited strongly by IL-1 alpha. Pretreatment of endothelium with tau IFN did not potentiate the effects of IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha on the endothelial MHC antigen expression. These results suggest a possible anti-inflammatory role of IL-1 alpha via down-regulation of MHC antigen expression by the endothelium.\r"

Two-color flow cytometric analysis of the activated T cells demonstrated that a maximum of 60% CD8 but only 25% CD4 cells expressed LeuM5; the mean percentage of LeuM5+ CD8 cells was 44% compared with 12% LeuM5+ CD4 cells. A variable proportion of the neoplastic T cells in 19 of 73 (26%) T-cell neoplasms were LeuM5+. Twelve of 18 CD4-CD8+ (67%) but only 5 of 40 CD4+ CD8- T-cell neoplasms expressed LeuM5. These studies demonstrate that the LeuM5 antigen is 1) expressed in association with T-cell activation, 2) preferentially expressed by activated CD8 cells, and 3) variably expressed by neoplastic T cells, but particularly by those exhibiting the CD4- CD8+ phenotype.\r"

Each volunteer received one dose of fentanyl or sufentanil and no sooner than 48 h later, the corresponding equipotent dose of the other opioid. End-tidal CO2 and ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO2 rebreathing were used to measure drug-induced respiratory effects. Analgesic effects were assessed by changes in the pain threshold to electric shock applied to the forearm. Plasma levels of fentanyl and sufentanil were measured by radioimmunoassay. Testing and sampling intervals were 5, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 300, and 360 min after drug administration. The magnitude and duration of depression of the ventilatory and occlusion pressure response were significantly less with sufentanil compared with fentanyl, irrespective of dose. Ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses returned to control values by 30 and 30 min, respectively, after sufentanil and by 240 and 120 min, respectively, after fentanyl. Statistically significant elevations of the pain threshold were, however, greater and longer lasting after sufentanil compared with fentanyl. Pain threshold returned to control values 180 min after sufentanil but only 90 min after fentanyl. These results suggest that sufentanil may provide better patient comfort with less respiratory depression than does fentanyl.\r"

In six dogs the responses to flumazenil were measured during administration of midazolam (1.6 mg/kg followed by 1.25 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenously) given along with inhalational anesthesia, whereas in the other six dogs the responses to flumazenil were measured during inhalational anesthesia without midazolam. Vf and Ra were determined using ventriculocisternal perfusion, and EEG activity was evaluated using aperiodic analysis. Flumazenil, 0.0025 and 0.16 mg/kg, was administered both when CSF pressure was normal and when CSF pressure was increased to 36-38 cmH2O by continuous infusion of mock CSF. Flumazenil produced no statistically significant change in Vf. Flumazenil did produce inconsistent and relatively small changes in Ra. Quantitative aperiodic analysis indicated changes in EEG activity only when the larger dose of flumazenil was given to dogs receiving midazolam. At normal CSF pressure the changes were consistent and were comprised of decreases in theta, alpha, and total hemispheric power. At elevated CSF pressure the changes were less consistent. It is concluded that smaller doses of flumazenil (which cause no EEG changes with the present method of analysis) and larger doses of flumazenil (which reverse midazolam-induced increase of theta and alpha activity) produce no change of Vf and no consistent change of Ra. Although flumazenil given in the presence of midazolam may increase Ra, thereby increasing CSF pressure and impairing contraction of CSF volume, this effect is not likely to be clinically important.\r"

The bolus injection of dTc 0.6 mg/kg caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that was associated with a significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (P less than 0.05 in both). The maximum MAP decrease and plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increase were noted at 2 min after dTc administration. Pretreatment with aspirin DL-lysine (25 mg/kg) or diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the responses of MAP (P less than 0.05 in both) and plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha level (P less than 0.01 for aspirin group, P less than 0.05 for diphenhydramine group). There was a significant correlation between the changes in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and those in MAP (Kendall tau (tau) = -0.504, P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that a bolus injection of dTc induces a release of prostacyclin through H1 receptor, which is responsible for the dTc-induced transient decrease of blood pressure in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Breathing circuit cannisters containing functional CO2 absorbent are critical to prevent rebreathing CO2 during general anesthesia using closed or semiclosed breathing systems. Ethyl violet is the indicator dye added to Sodasorb to indicate impending exhaustion of the absorbent. A case of CO2 rebreathing due to failure of ethyl violet indicator in exhausted Sodasorb was encountered. Laboratory investigation demonstrated that dye failure could result from photodeactivation caused by fluorescent lights. Using a fixed intensity fluorescent light source and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis, a highly significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated between duration of light exposure and the decrease in ethyl violet concentration. After 24 h of fluorescent light exposure with a received flux density of 46 nwatts/cm2 at 254 nm, the concentration of functional ethyl violet remaining in pulverized Sodasorb was 16% of the baseline value. Furthermore, using multiple light sources of various intensities, the greater the intensity of light, the more rapid the rate of decline of the ethyl violet concentration. It is recommended to minimize the problem by using ultraviolet filters and incorporating additional ethyl violet in Sodasorb. Finally, ethyl violet undergoes temporal deactivation after a Sodasorb container is opened, even if it is stored in the dark.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (n = 63) or intracardiac (n = 23) surgery were randomly assigned with respect to the target value for PaCO2 during cardiopulmonary bypass. In 44 patients the target PaCO2 was 40 mmHg, measured at the standard electrode temperature of 37 degrees C, while in 42 patients the target PaCO2 was 40 mmHg, corrected to the patient's rectal temperature (lowest value reached: mean 30.1, SD 1.9 degrees C). Other salient features of bypass management include use of bubble oxygenators without arterial filtration, flows of 1.8-2.4 l.min-1.m-2, mean hematocrit of 23%, and mean arterial blood pressure of approximately 70 mmHg, achieved by infusion of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside. Neuropsychologic function was assessed with series of tests administered on the day prior to surgery, just before discharge from the hospital (mean 8.0, SD 5.8 days postoperatively, n = 82), and again 7 months later (mean 220.7, SD 54.4 days postoperatively, n = 75). The scores at 8 days showed wide variability and generalized impairment unrelated to the PaCO2 group or to hypotension during cardiopulmonary bypass. At 7 months no significant difference was observed in neuropsychologic performance between the PaCO2 groups. Regarding cardiac outcome, there were no significant differences between groups in the appearance of new Q-waves on the electrocardiogram, the postoperative creatine kinase-MB fraction, the need for inotropic or intraaortic balloon pump support, or the length of postoperative ventilation or intensive care unit stay. These findings support the hypothesis that CO2 management during cardiopulmonary bypass at moderate hypothermia has no clinically significant effect on either neurobehavioral or cardiac outcome.\r"

With the advent of cyclosporine, artificial organs, and organ-assist devices, the possibility of suitable patients with end-stage organ disease becoming successful transplant recipients has increased dramatically. Consequently, the need for donor organs has risen. The greatest source of potential organ-tissue donors exists in the acute care setting (ie, emergency departments and intensive care units). To meet the need for this increasing demand, emergency physicians must become familiar with the techniques of procurement. Part 1 defines the problem of procurement and presents financial, historic, organizational, legal, and psychosocial aspects of organ-tissue procurement. A synopsis of brain death concludes the discussion. Part 2 (February 1990) presents aspects of the evaluation, selection, maintenance, and management of the organ-tissue donor. Disease transmission and controversial issues in organ-tissue procurement also are discussed.\r"

No cross-reaction was observed with sera from 12 patients with active histoplasmosis or from five patients with active coccidioidomycosis or from 23 healthy persons. In contrast, all patients' sera cross-reacted in conventional EIAs based on commercial immunodiffusion antigens. The blastomycosis-specific EIA seems to offer sensitivity without compromising specificity. Rheumatoid factors, which could cause false-positive reactions, were controlled for.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the evidence on four questions about screening asymptomatic adults for arterial hypertension: Is hypertension a significant health problem? Is it detectable at an early, presymptomatic stage? Is treatment available and effective? Do the benefits of screening outweigh the costs and risks? DATA IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION: We did a computerized search of the MEDLARS data base to identify community-based trials of drug therapy for mild hypertension; other relevant citations are included when appropriate. DATA SYNTHESIS: We approached the preliminary questions in our analysis by narrative review and argument. The estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness of screening was addressed by formal mathematical modeling of the effect of screening on various U.S. populations. RESULTS OF ANALYSIS: Hypertension is clearly a significant health problem. It can be detected early, and effective treatment is available. Screening asymptomatic adults for hypertension has benefits that compare favorably to the risks and costs involved. According to our estimates, screening is most cost-effective for older adults compared with younger adults and for men compared with women and is highly sensitive to the cost of therapy for mild hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend hypertension screening for all adults. We also discuss the frequency and setting of screening activities. When a low-cost therapy is used, the cost-effectiveness of screening for hypertension compares favorably with other cardiovascular interventions.\r"

We screened strains of B. catarrhalis recovered in the United States since 1952 and identified the first beta-lactamase-positive isolate in August 1976. The prevalence of the enzymes among 394 clinical isolates from one Texas hospital has averaged 75% since testing began in 1983. Screening of isolates of Moraxella subgenus Moraxella revealed the BRO enzymes in two other human respiratory tract species, M. lacunata and M. nonliquefaciens, beginning in 1978. A different beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.4 predominated in other species of subgenus Moraxella. BRO-2 had a different isoelectric focusing pattern and was produced in lesser amounts than BRO-1, but the two enzymes were indistinguishable by substrate or inhibitor profile. BRO enzymes from B. catarrhalis, M. nonliquefaciens, and M. lacunata could be transferred by conjugation and, for B. catarrhalis, also by transformation to B. catarrhalis. Plasmid bands were demonstrated in 90% of M. nonliquefaciens and in one previously reported strain of B. catarrhalis, but no change in plasmid profiles was seen in beta-lactamase-positive recombinants, supporting previous studies that suggested the beta-lactamase genes are chromosomal.\r"

There was a remarkable similarity between antichloroplastic and antibacterial activities of DNA gyrase inhibitors. Quinolones produced 100% chloroplast-free cells in concentrations which do not affect cell viability. Optimal conditions were exponential growth, continuous illumination, and neutral or slightly alkaline pH. Coumarins were more toxic than quinolones. Among the quinolones, ofloxacin was the most potent in eliminating chloroplasts. Among the coumarins, coumermycin A1 was the most potent. New quinolones and coumermycin A1 were able to induce the complete inability of originally green cells to form green colonies after 24 h of drug exposure, while clorobiocin and novobiocin required several days of exposure. Darkness, heat shock (42 degrees C, 10 min), or simultaneous treatment with chloramphenicol or rifampin decreased the potency of DNA gyrase inhibitors for producing chloroplast-free cells. Remarkably, in cells in which division was blocked by three different methods (resting medium, hyperthermic conditions [37 degrees C], or addition of cycloheximide), new quinolones and coumermycin A1 nevertheless eliminated chloroplasts. The antichloroplastic activity of DNA gyrase inhibitors is additional data suggesting an evolutionary relationship between chloroplasts and eubacteria.\r"

Drug accumulation was unsaturable over a range of 5 to 80 micrograms/ml, suggesting that ciprofloxacin accumulates by diffusion in P. aeruginosa. Although all four strains accumulated two- to sevenfold more ciprofloxacin in the presence of the inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the cfxB mutants accumulated two- to fourfold less drug than either PAO2 or the cfxA2 mutant. Polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a protein common to cfxB mutants only, while all strains had similar lipopolysaccharide profiles. The results suggest that ciprofloxacin accumulation in P. aeruginosa is a complex phenomenon that may be affected by both an energy-dependent drug efflux process and outer envelope composition.\r"

  ".W": "Intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to phosphanilic acid (PA) than cells of Escherichia coli. In cell extracts, the dihydropteroate synthases of P. aeruginosa and E. coli were about equally susceptible to inhibition by PA. These results suggest that cells of P. aeruginosa are more permeable to PA than cells of E. coli. Although a weak inhibitor, PA acted on dihydropteroate synthase in the same manner as the sulfonamides with which PA is structurally related. Inhibition of E. coli by PA in a basal salts-glucose medium was prevented by p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA). However, pABA did not protect P. aeruginosa from PA under these conditions, possibly because pABA itself exhibited an inhibitory effect. PA also appeared to have a second mode of action. The mechanism was not elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro activity of dactimicin, a new pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside which possesses a formimidoyl group, was compared with those of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin against 500 isolates. Dactimicin inhibited 90% of isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. It was more active than amikacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter agglomerans, Yersinia species, and Salmonella species, with an MIC for 90% of the strains (MIC90) of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. Dactimicin did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci but had an MIC50 (MIC for 50% of strains tested) of 2 micrograms/ml against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Dactimicin in combination with piperacillin acted synergistically against 75% of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus isolates. It exhibited an excellent postantibiotic suppressive effect on E. coli. Dactimicin was active against organisms possessing aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(2')-b, AAC(3)-III, -IV, and -V, and AAC(6')-Ia, -Ib, Ic, -II, and -IV but was not active against isolates which contained AAC(3)-I and the bifunctional APH(2\")-AAC(6')-I. Its lack of activity against P. aeruginosa appeared to be permeability related since in the presence of EDTA P. aeruginosa was susceptible, as were mutant isolates resistant because of permeability barriers.\r"

  ".U": "90120687\r", 
  ".W": "Fourteen firemen exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their byproducts generated in a transformer fire and explosion had neurophysiological and neuropsychological tests 6 mo after the fire. They were re-studied 6 wk later after undergoing 2-3 wk of an experimental detoxification program consisting of medically supervised diet, exercise, and sauna. A case-control comparison with firemen matched from the same department, but who did not participate in controlling the transformer fire, had shown significant impairment of memory for stories, visual images, and digits backwards. Cognitive function was impaired for block design, identifying embedded figures, and design association and recognition using Culture Fair. Making of trails and choice reaction time, which measured cognitive function and perceptual motor speed, were also impaired. These signs of protracted neurobehavioral impairment were attributed to PCBs and heat-produced byproducts. No relationship, however, was found between the firemen's serum or fat levels of PCBs as Arochlor 1248 and their type or degree of neurobehavioral impairment. Retesting following the detoxification program showed significantly improved scores on: three memory tests, block design, trails B, and embedded figures. Thus, there was significant reversibility of impairment after the detoxification interval. However self-appraisal scores for depression, anger, and fatigue--which were initially elevated--and for vigor--which was reduced--did not change across this interval.\r"

Less chlorinated PCBs were quantitated as Aroclor 1242, and more highly chlorinated PCBs were quantitated as Aroclor 1254. The median half-life was 2.6 y for Aroclor 1242 and 4.8 y for Aroclor 1254. However, the half-life varied inversely with the initial serum concentration. This pattern may be a result of continued low-level exposure, variation in the time of exposure, or enzyme induction by PCBs.\r"

  ".U": "90120742\r", 
  ".W": "We performed a randomized study on patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting to examine whether postoperative infusion of nifedipine (n = 25) could reduce the incidence of isolated transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, or both. The control group (n = 25) received nitroglycerin. Hemodynamic and Holter monitoring and serial assessment of enzymatic and electrocardiographic changes were performed for all patients. Both groups showed comparable preoperative and operative data. The incidence of myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the nifedipine group (n = 1) as compared with the control group (n = 4), whereas the number of patients with isolated transient myocardial ischemia was similar in both groups (nifedipine, 3; control, 4). At the time of peak activity, levels of creatine kinase (350 +/- 129 versus 511 +/- 287 IU/mL), creatine kinase-MB (8.4 +/- 5.4 versus 17.1 +/- 11.0 IU/mL), and glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase (30.4 +/- 4.4 versus 41.0 +/- 7.9 IU/mL) were markedly lower in the nifedipine group (p less than 0.05). We conclude that infusion of nifedipine after elective coronary artery bypass grafting effectively decreases the incidence of myocardial infarction and the extent of myocardial necrosis during the early postoperative period.\r"
