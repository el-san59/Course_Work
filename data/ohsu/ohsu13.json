  ".W": "This analysis examined the relationship between life-strain (e.g., physical health problems, economic deprivation, and ADL impairment) and psychosomatic and emotional distress in old age, while taking into account the effects of age, race, sex, education, social support, and other measures of social resources. The data was drawn from a statewide household survey (N = 2,146) of noninstitutionalized older people. Using multiple regression analysis with tests for statistical interaction, the findings revealed that women, whites, those living alone, and those with less education had greater sources of strain. Individuals with greater sources of strain were also more likely to receive social support, although they tended to have smaller social networks and less social contact. Health status and ADL were the strongest predictors of distress. Social support was positively related whereas social contact was negatively related to distress. Social support had a moderating influence on the relationship between ADL impairment and psychosomatic symptoms of distress. Other measures of social resources, such as living arrangement and support network size, had neither main nor interactive effects on distress. The findings were discussed in light of their implications for future research.\r"

Two additional age-matched control groups were similarly handled and placed on the nonmoving treadmill for the same duration. Chronic exercise did not alter blood pressure in the adult group but lowered resting blood pressure in the aged rats during the midportion of the training period. On the other hand, the adult group demonstrated a significant decrease in the resting heart rate from Weeks 3 through 7 during training, whereas the aged group showed no change in resting heart rate during the entire study. These findings suggest that there may exist an age-related difference in the effect of exercise training on basal cardiovascular homeostasis, which is cardioinhibitory in the adult and vasodepressant in the aged.\r"

Assessment of vasopressin release from isolated hypothalamic-neurohypophysial units by means of an in vitro perifusion system demonstrated that hormone discharge increased as the animals aged, being evident by age 7 months. The increased vasopressin releasability could not be attributed to the greater vasopressin content present in the posterior pituitary of the older rats. The data suggest that increased vasopressin secretion is an early manifestation of aging in the rat and that the consequent hypervasopressinemia may affect the renal tubule with resultant diminished responsiveness to the hormone.\r"

MMS and mDRS at follow-up also predicted mortality during a subsequent year of follow-up (p less than .01). Estimated change in MMS and mDRS was significantly correlated with all transition variables, except for MMS and results suggest MMS, mDRS, and estimated change in them reflect these aspects of transitional health status in dementia.\r"

Older participants in the study tended to be lower in both Positive and Negative Affect, but longitudinal changes in these two subscales were not found, and Total Well-Being showed no significant age, birth cohort, or time effects in any of the analyses. Given the size and representativeness of the sample, this is strong evidence of the stability of mean levels of psychological well-being in adulthood, and points to the importance of enduring personality dispositions and processes of adaptation in determining levels of well-being.\r"

Data on 150 people, between the ages of 50 and 82, yielded high correlations between three measures of well-being (the MUNSH, the LSI-Z, and the PGC) and the Edwards Social Desirability Scale, but only moderate ones between well-being scales and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Part correlations between well-being measures and an external criterion of happiness, controlling for social desirability, failed to improve on the zero-order criterion/well-being relationship. Controlling for social desirability, therefore, does not enhance the construct validity of well-being scales. These and related results suggest that the high zero-order correlations between measures of well-being and the Edwards scale are more readily attributed to content similarity between the Edwards scale and measures of well-being than to a social desirability response bias in well-being measures.\r"

In contrast, nondepressed women attributed failure to bad luck and success to high ability. In the second part of the study, the reformulated model's hypothesis was tested regarding personal and universal helplessness. Although it only approached significance it was consistent with the hypothesis; depressed women saw themselves as personally helpless when compared with others for failure outcomes; nondepressed women saw themselves as universally helpless (i.e., everyone would fail the task). A revised clinical treatment model was proposed suggesting an interactionist strategy in treating depression.\r"

Following the pretest, one group participated in 7 weeks of videogame play, whereas a second group did not. All participants were posttested on the same two-choice RT task. The results of the analysis of covariance revealed that those elderly individuals who played videogames were faster than the control participants under both levels of S-R compatibility. The effect of videogame play, however, was greater for low compatibility. These results are taken as support for a potential to improve response selection through videogame play.\r"

The older women's performances declined at a more rapid rate as the retention interval was increased. When the older women practiced the auditory task, performances improved and gains transferred to the visual task. Gains by the younger women were equivalent, so that initial age differences were maintained. Signal detection analyses attributed age effects to differences in sensitivity rather than bias. For women of both ages, conservative bias was greater when the intervals were long and when the task was visual. The absence of age-bias effects was contrary to the hypothesis that older adults adopt more conservative decision strategies. The presence of sensitivity differences, even when the task was well practiced, suggests fundamental age differences in recognition memory.\r"

  ".W": "This paper analyzes the determinants of interstate inmigration and outmigration for persons aged 5 to 54 and for persons aged 55 and over. The paper finds several similarities between the sets of migration determinants, but several potentially important differences emerge as well. Perhaps most striking among these are that states with high earnings of workers tend to have high rates of outmigration of elderly adults and that states with high levels of unemployment have high levels of inmigration of elderly people--these relationships are generally the opposite of those found for the nonelderly. This suggests the possibility of continued divergence in the spatial distribution of younger and older populations and offers the potential for the continued reallocation of resources between states (through the federal government) to pay for programs earmarked for the older population.\r"

Response was 66% and 65%, respectively. Performance difficulty, frequency of use, and success rate were evaluated. The willingness of physicians to order, and paramedics to perform each procedure were compared. Physicians' and paramedics' difficulty ratings were significantly different (P less than .001) for only 3 of the 11 procedures. During the study period, paramedics successfully performed 455 procedures; 229 were performed by 15 (13%) of the responding paramedics. The reported success rate for all attempted procedures was 82% (455/557). The number of attempts and the success rate was significantly higher (P less than .05) for paramedics with secondary medically affiliated employment. Paramedics were significantly more willing to perform 7 of the 11 procedures (P less than .001) than physicians were willing to order. We conclude that paramedic and physician difficulty ratings were generally similar, that many types of ALS procedures are rarely performed, that a small percentage of paramedics perform the largest number of ALS procedures, that secondary employment increases paramedics' procedural attempts and improves success rates, and that they are more willing to perform ALS procedures than physicians are to order them.\r"

On the basis of this, we discuss ways to help reduce the effects of a major release of an irritant gas. People living in the vicinity of potential health hazards need information on how to behave in case of accidents. Rescue workers and medical personnel must be trained to operate under \"toxic conditions.\" There must be planning for treatment of thousands of patients at the same time, a circumstance that will often require temporary \"satellite hospitals\" to be opened. As symptoms and injuries are of the same kind, even if the magnitude and the effect may differ, treatment can, in many ways, be standardized. Therefore members of the health care team, irrespective of their daily different specialty fields, can work with the most urgent missions.\r"

This solution incorporates new methods, called dose-response surface assays and analysis (DRSA), which estimate cytolytic activity coefficients on a surface in a three-dimensional space with two dose variables (killers and targets) and one response variable (counts). These new methods based on dose-response surfaces are demonstrated to be more informative and reliable than classical methods based on dose-response curves. In a test of the methods' robustness (sensitivity of parameter estimates to changes in the dose levels of the assay design), cytolytic activity coefficients estimated by DRSA varied by less than or equal to 30% over a reduction of three to four orders of magnitude in the dose levels. This remarkable robustness should be compared with the corresponding figures of as much as 500% over less than 1 order of magnitude for previously published results of coefficients estimated by conventional methods. DRSA is distinguished from replot-of-plots methods such as those used for enzyme inhibition assays in biochemistry, and is recommended as a more efficient method that should replace replot-of-plot methods now antiquated by the advent of microcomputers. DRSA can be applied to any experimental system that requires an activity coefficient to be estimated on a dose-response surface in a space of greater than or equal to 3 dimensions (greater than or equal to 2 dose variables and one response variable), regardless of the mathematical model and statistical estimators used to analyze the dose-response interaction. Finally, DRSA is compared with the methods known as response surface methodology (RSM), and is described as a new class of methods to be added to those that constitute RSM.\r"

In the present study, we probe for exogenous antigens in the IC by examining the specificity of antisera raised against the IC. Anti-IC antisera demonstrated strong reactivity against the viral capsid antigen (VCA) of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), which was not explained by preimmune reactivity, polyclonal B cell activation, or Fc-mediated binding in the immunofluorescence or ELISA systems used to measure antibody titers. However, comparable anti-VCA reactivity was detected in antisera raised against non-rheumatoid SF. This phenomenon was not due to antigen since monoclonal anti-VCA antibody probing the IC by Western blot detected only IgG, nor to idiotype/anti-idiotype interaction since normal IgG absorbed out the anti-VCA reactivity. A monoclonal anti-VCA antibody competitively inhibited the binding of anti-IgG to IgG, and Fc fragment of IgG competitively inhibited the monoclonal antibody binding to VCA. No relationship between IgG anti-VCA antibody and IgG rheumatoid factor could be demonstrated. These data demonstrate an unexpected cross-reactivity of Fc fragment of IgG and VCA of EBV through the analysis of SF IC.\r"

Our previous findings suggested that the amelioration of CIA in mice by a fish oil diet was associated with macrophage accumulation and metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid and a subsequently altered prostaglandin (PG) profile. In these experiments, we examined the role of gender and found that macrophages from female arthritis-susceptible B10.RIII or B10.G mice synthesized more PG and thromboxane than macrophages isolated from the males. Compared with males, female mice had higher circulating anti-type II collagen antibodies but were less likely to develop CIA. Females, especially those on a fish oil diet, developed a much less severe disease than the males. This supports our hypothesis that the type and/or amount of eicosanoid produced from the macrophage may alter the course of experimentally induced arthritis.\r"

Purified polyclonal or monoclonal anti-idiotype (Id) antibodies were prepared against each of the isolated serum paraproteins. In all five individuals, the patient saliva samples inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled homologous Ig to the corresponding anti-Id antibodies, but normal saliva did not. The concentration of Id in patients' saliva varied from 1 to 400 micrograms/ml; i.e., 0.004 to 1.0% of the corresponding serum values. Saliva of a lymphoma patient whose IgM kappa protein exhibited rheumatoid factor (RF) activity also contained RF. The salivary Id-bearing molecules were found to have the same Ig isotype as the serum paraproteins. The myeloma IgA represented a minor component (0.4 and 3.9%) of the total salivary IgA. The salivary IgA myeloma proteins were associated at least in part with secretory component, but the salivary IgG paraproteins were not. In an IgA myeloma patient, a minority (17%) of the IgA+ plasma cells found in the lacrymal gland biopsy specimen were Id+, whereas the great majority (98%) of bone marrow IgA plasma cells were Id+. The results suggest active transport rather than passive transudation of myeloma IgA into the patients' saliva, and the integrity of the secretory immune system was not compromised by the neoplastic process.\r"

Of 20 SLE sera that had strong antibody activity for multiple intact histones, 17 showed minimal activity with any of the corresponding trypsin-resistant fragments. A markedly different pattern of reactivity was present in sera of patients with procainamide (Pr)-induced lupus in which antibodies to H2A, H2B, and the H2A-H2B complex had strong fragment activity. Interestingly, recognition of trypsin-resistant fragments was also noted in a small number of SLE sera that contained antibodies to the H2A-H2B complex. In contrast to both SLE and Pr-induced lupus, antibodies induced by hydralazine (Hy) reacted primarily with H3 and H4. Furthermore, these antibodies bound equally well to the corresponding trypsin-resistant regions that are thought to be relatively unexposed in native nucleosomes. Thus, the specificities of anti-histone antibodies in SLE, Pr-induced lupus, and Hy-induced lupus are markedly different, but in each disease reactivity appears to be restricted to a limited number of histone determinants. The data raise the possibility that autoantigen in the form of native nucleosomes may be recognized in SLE and possibly in Pr-induced lupus. In contrast, the propensity of Hy to induce autoantibodies to determinants usually not recognized in SLE or Pr-induced lupus may suggest a different immunogenic stimulus in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Functional domains on the recombinant interferon-alpha 2 (rIFN-alpha 2) molecule, which are involved in antiviral and NK enhancing activities, have been defined by immunochemical mapping with MAb, and their relationship with the IFN cellular receptor binding site has been studied. With 20 different anti-IFN-alpha 2 MAb selected by their binding to 125I-labeled IFN and by immunoprecipitation of the 20 Kd IFN molecule, we have defined three spatially separated epitopes (designated as sites A, B, and C) and two partially overlapping antigenic determinants on the IFN-alpha 2 molecule. Functional relation of IFN-alpha 2 A, B, and C epitopes have been determined by assaying the effect of various anti-IFN MAb on IFN-mediated biologic activities. MAb directed to sites A and B neutralized the antiviral activity of IFN. Furthermore, the MAb specific for site B displayed a neutralizing potency threefold higher than MAb directed to site A. Site B was also involved in the enhancing activity of IFN on NK-mediated cell cytotoxicity, whereas site A was not. MAb directed to site C partially affected the IFN-boosted NK activity but did not neutralize the IFN antiviral activity. Inhibition studies of 125I-IFN binding to human U-937 myelomonocytic cells by anti-IFN MAb demonstrated that MAb directed to site B blocked different IFN biologic functions by preventing its binding to the cellular receptor, whereas MAb directed to sites A and C caused no inhibition and partial inhibition of this binding, respectively.\r"

A highly significant correlation was found between these two series of inhibition constants when no correlation existed between the inhibition constants for the antibody and those for other receptors. This suggests that the binding site for tricyclic anti-depressants on the antibody mimics the binding site for these ligands on muscarinic receptors. Although nortriptyline reveals a noncompetitive inhibition of N-methyl-scopolamine binding to muscarinic receptors, muscarinic ligands display weak or no binding to the antibody. These findings indicate that the binding site for tricyclic anti-depressants on the receptor is distinct from that for the muscarinic ligands.\r"

  ".W": "Connective tissue-type mast cells (CTMC) and mast cells grown in vitro exhibit many differences in morphology, biochemistry, and function. When cultured mast cells of WBB6F1-+/+ mouse origin were injected into the peritoneal cavity of genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice, however, the cultured mast cells acquired characteristics similar to CTMC. In this study, we analyzed the changing process. When the density of the cultured mast cells was measured by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, the proportion of dense mast cells increased after injection into the peritoneal cavity. Because the increase in proportion of dense mast cells paralleled the increase in proportion of heparin-containing mast cells, both parameters may be used as an index for differentiation activity of cultured mast cells into CTMC. When proliferation activity of mast cells was estimated by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, the proliferation activity decreased after the i.p. transfer. Moreover, when cultured mast cells were recovered 10 wk after the i.p. transfer, the mast cells almost lost proliferation activity in the same culture condition that had been used for establishment of cultured mast cells from the bone marrow of WBB6F1-+/+ mice. These results demonstrate that the proliferation arrest and the acquisition of CTMC-like characters are associated after i.p. transfer of cultured mast cells.\r"

  ".U": "87084788\r", 
  ".W": "L-Arginine is required for expression of the activated macrophage cytotoxic effector mechanism that causes inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, aconitase activity, and DNA synthesis in tumor target cells. This effector mechanism is active in the presence of L-arginine even when the cocultivation medium lacks all other amino acids and serum. Cytotoxic activated macrophage-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in target cells is proportional to the concentration of L-arginine in the medium. L-Arginine must be present during the cocultivation period. Pretreatment of cytotoxic activated macrophages with L-arginine or posttreatment of the target cells after cocultivation is not effective. D-Arginine does not substitute for L-arginine and at high concentrations is a competitive inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism. Other analogues that could not replace L-arginine include agmatine, argininic acid, arginine hydroxamate, and tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester. L-homoarginine, however, can effectively substitute for L-arginine. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine is a potent competitive inhibitor of this effector mechanism. High concentrations of lipopolysaccharide do not reverse inhibition of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. However, inhibition of the effector mechanism by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine can be overridden by increasing the concentration of L-arginine in the culture medium. We compared NGNG-dimethyl-L-arginine and NGN1G-dimethyl-L-arginine with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine as inhibitors of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism. The results show that the inhibitory effect of these guanidino methylated derivatives of L-arginine is highly determined by structure. Guanidine is a weak competitive inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism. The requirement for L-arginine does not appear to be for protein synthesis, creatine biosynthesis, polyamine biosynthesis, or ADP ribosylation reactions. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide is effective as a second signal only when the cocultivation medium contains L-arginine, and this strict L-arginine dependency is not overridden by increasing the concentration of lipopolysaccharide. Bovine liver arginase, by competing for L-arginine in the cocultivation medium, inhibits the L-arginine-dependent activated macrophage cytotoxic effector mechanism.\r"

Because pathogens that achieve intracellular survival escape destruction by reactive oxidants, we investigated the relationship between the intracellular survival of H. capsulatum and the macrophage oxidative burst. H. capsulatum yeast failed to stimulate the release of reactive oxygen metabolites in unprimed murine macrophages despite extensive phagocytosis of the microorganisms. This effect was observed with live as well as heat-killed fungi over a wide range of yeast-to-macrophage ratios. Preincubation of murine macrophages with heat-killed H. capsulatum (but not with latex spheres), followed by incubation with unopsonized zymosan, resulted in inhibition of oxidative burst triggering without inhibition of zymosan phagocytosis. Ingestion of H. capsulatum yeast opsonized with the cognate mouse antibody resulted in significant oxidant release, suggesting that suppression of the respiratory burst may be circumvented through Fc-mediated phagocytosis.\r"

Antibodies to EBNA-1 can be detected by means of immunoblotting. Preincubation of antisera with purified EBNA-1 protein inhibits the binding of IgG antibodies in this system, indicating that those epitopes detected by immunoblots are also accessible on the native molecule. A number of synthetic peptides the sequences of which were derived from the glycine-alanine repeating region of EBNA-1 and from regions adjacent to it also inhibited antibody binding to EBNA-1. These showed, however, a 1000-fold variation in their inhibitory activities. Peptides containing only glycine and alanine were the most effective inhibitors. The anti-EBNA-1 antibodies did not react with several other peptides representing sequences from unrelated proteins. At saturating concentrations of peptide 85 to 100% of anti-EBNA-1, antibody binding was inhibited in all sera tested with one exception. Similar results are obtained when antibody binding is assayed by an enzyme immunosorbent assay by using partially purified EBNA-1 to coat the plates. Thus the glycine-alanine region, either through its primary structure or through conformations assumed by this region, forms the major epitope(s) of the EBNA-1 molecule.\r"

  ".W": "In most mouse strains, expression of a gene encoding sex-limited protein (Slp), an isotype of the fourth component of complement (C4), is induced by testosterone, or the gene is not expressed at all; however, in some wild-derived strains carrying H-2w7, H-2w16, or H-2w19 haplotype, Slp is expressed constitutively in the same way as C4. To examine the structural basis for the testosterone-independent expression of Slp, 41 overlapping clones together encoding the S region were isolated from C3H.W7 mouse (H-2w7) cosmid library. Five C4-related genes each spanning approximately 16 kb were identified among the cluster of cosmid clones and were isolated for structural study. One of the genes (C4w7) hybridized with the C4-specific oligonucleotide probe but not with the Slp-specific oligonucleotide probe, whereas the other genes (Slpw7a, Slpw7b, Slpw7c, and Slpw7d) hybridized only with the Slp-specific probe. Restriction mapping of these genes and sequencing of the selected regions of 5'-flanking regions of the genes were performed, and the results were compared with the data obtained with the C4 and Slp genes of FM (H-2d) and B10.BR (H-2k). These studies showed that three of the C4-related genes of C3H.W7 (Slpw7b, Slpw7c, and Slpw7d) are C4-Slp recombinant genes comprising a 5'-region derived from C4 gene and a 3'-region derived from Slp gene. It is suggested that 5'-flanking region derived from C4 in these C4-Slp recombinant genes accounts for testosterone-independent expression of Slp in C3H.W7 mouse.\r"

Both phenomena were hapten-specific. Decreased systemic reactivity in repeatedly painted guinea pigs is probably not due to receptor blockade or the development of hapten-specific antibodies, but rather to transient sequestration of hapten-specific effector cells within lymph nodes draining the site of hapten exposure. After discontinuation of allergen exposure, effector cells return into the circulation, as indicated by a reversal of systemic hyporesponsiveness within 5 weeks. The persistence of a cellular infiltrate at the site of repeated application and the hapten-specific unresponsiveness at this site suggest that suppressor cells play a role in local unresponsiveness. Upon discontinuation of allergen exposure, local unresponsiveness rapidly dissolves (within one week). Since the circulation is still depleted of effector cells, residual hyporesponsiveness may persist for longer periods.\r"

Epidermal basal cells (above 95%) obtained from human skin by trypsinization were cultivated statically on the beads in 96-well culture plates. Proliferation was rapid and great in synchronous waves during 2-7 days after inoculation. The growth rate depended on the inoculation cell population densities. When cells were inoculated at 7.75 X 10(4)/well, the maximum increase was 3.6-fold and at 1.69 X 10(4)/well and 0.32 X 10(4)/well, 2.5-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. Differentiation was assessed visually on a hemocytometer. The percentage of basal cells of the total cells present in each well was reduced from 98% (on inoculation) to approximately 25% in a week and thereafter. In 1 month after inoculation, cells with keratohyaline-like granules were observed at 12%. The attachment of cells to the beads was rather loose. Cells were supposed to be attached to denatured collagen on the beads via fibronectin contained in the serum of the medium, because denatured collagen had the property to bind strongly to fibronectin. Loose attachment made it possible to harvest intact cells without the use of trypsin. This cell culture system with such new characteristics will be a useful tool for studying epidermal cell biology and biochemistry.\r"

Ligand binding assays with saturating concentrations of all trans-[3H]retinol or of all trans-[11-3H]retinoic acid were used to quantitate amounts of binding proteins in cytosols prepared from these skin layers or cultured cells. The epidermal levels of CRABP and CRBP (60.9 +/- 14.4 and 7.3 +/- 1.7 pmol per mg cytosol protein, respectively) were markedly higher than that reported for adult epidermis but were comparable to levels in keratinocytes cultured from neonatal foreskin epidermis (61.8 +/- 7.8 and 10.7 +/- 2.5, respectively). The levels of CRABP were much lower in the foreskin dermis than in the epidermis and the levels measured in the fibroblasts cultured from this dermis were consistent with the dermal levels. However, CRBP levels in cultured dermal fibroblasts were very low and could not account for the dermal CRBP levels, suggesting that another dermal cell type has high levels of CRBP.\r"

After 21 days in organ culture, only basal cells in the fetal epidermis labeled with tritiated thymidine, while both basal and intermediate cells in the embryonic epidermis labeled and the total LI for fetal and embryonic epidermal cells was the same as the adult epidermal LI (7%). The LI for periderm decreased with increasing estimated gestational age (EGA) from 9.5% at 49 days EGA to 0.4% at 85 days EGA. A subpopulation of epithelial cells that retained tritiated thymidine label and that have some of the attributes associated with stem cells has been previously demonstrated in rodents. In order to examine human embryonic and fetal epidermis for the presence of such cells, epidermis from various gestational ages were labeled and grown in organ culture for 21 days. The mean percent label-retaining cells (LRCs) for embryonic and fetal epidermis was determined. Approximately 4% of the embryonic and 2% of the fetal epidermal cells retained label for 21 days in organ culture. Embryonic LRCs were found in the basal and suprabasal layers, but fetal LRCs were found only in the basal layer. The presence of LRCs in human embryonic and fetal epidermis suggests that epithelial cell proliferation in these tissues may be regulated via a stem cell pattern of proliferation.\r"

In attachment assays, the attachment of cells to laminin (137% of control) or to Matrix (158% of control) was significantly higher when compared with plastic (p less than 0.01), and the attachment to Matrix was higher than to laminin (p less than 0.05). Varying the amount of laminin or Matrix used as a substratum showed each enhanced cell attachment to the same maximum value (approximately 50% attached cells or 160% of control), but maximal attachment was achieved with lower amounts of Matrix (15 micrograms Matrix vs 15-30 micrograms laminin, p less than 0.05). Inhibition studies with anti-entactin and anti-laminin antibodies were used to assay the specific contribution of entactin to cell attachment to Matrix. Pretreatment of the substratum with increasing amounts of anti-entactin antibody decreased cell attachment to Matrix in a concentration-dependent manner, with cell attachment to Matrix eventually falling to the same level as that obtained with laminin. There was no effect with anti-entactin on cell attachment to laminin or to plastic controls, and nonspecific rabbit IgG had no effect on any group. Similar experiments were performed using 2 different concentrations of anti-laminin antibody. At a low concentration, anti-laminin antibody decreased attachment to laminin (to a level equivalent to the plastic control). At a higher concentration anti-laminin decreased attachment to Matrix, but to a level that was still greater than the plastic control. The anti-laminin antibody had no effect on attachment to the plastic control and nonspecific rat IgG in equivalent amounts had no effect on attachment to any of the substrata. These results indicate that Matrix, containing laminin and entactin, enhanced cell attachment above the level seen with laminin alone, and that this effect was probably due to the presence of entactin in the Matrix.\r"

  ".W": "A cell line (SCC-25) derived from a human squamous cell carcinoma was found to have a higher level of in situ thymidylate synthase activity when compared to a faster-growing cell line, L1210 leukemia, and approximately 5 times the level of activity of a cell line with the same growth rate, S91-A melanoma. These results led to an examination of the effects of both direct and indirect inhibitors of this enzyme using intact SCC-25 cells. It was found that drugs that have an indirect effect on this enzyme--methotrexate (MTX), hydroxyurea (HU), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine (3,4-DHBA)--acted as noncompetitive inhibitors and the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by these drugs did not result in the accumulation of its substrate, dUMP. This suggested that these drugs are also inhibiting steps leading to the formation of dUMP by a mechanism that is coordinated with the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), a competitive inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, did cause an increase in the dUMP pool size indicating that this drug did not affect the synthesis of this substrate. There was a good correlation for the inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis, and thymidylate synthase with HU, 3,4-DHBA, and FUDR. However, the results suggested fundamentally different mechanistic reasons for the close relationship among these three inhibitory effects. Finally the inhibition of growth by MTX did not appear to correlate with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The implication of these results for the therapy of epidermally derived proliferative disorders, especially with combinations such as MTX and 5-FU, is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87084896\r", 
  ".W": "Assay systems for the evaluation of carcinogen interaction with human tissues are essential for assessing cancer risk. Hair follicles are a readily available source of human epithelial tissue and offer an excellent system with which to study carcinogen metabolism in human populations. In this study freshly plucked human hair follicles were employed to measure the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene (BP), benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol (BP 7,8-diol), and the enzyme-mediated binding of [3H]-BP to DNA. The effect of human exposure to a crude coal tar (CCT)-containing shampoo, a preparation rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), on these parameters was also evaluated. Twelve healthy volunteers were studied before and after shampooing their hair daily for 4 days with the CCT-containing shampoo. Wide interindividual variation was observed in basal cytochrome P-450-dependent aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity which ranged from 0.6-17.6 fmol water-soluble BP metabolites/h/hair follicle (mean +/- SE of 32 individuals was 9.7 +/- 0.9). After use of the shampoo for 4 days AHH activity increased in 10 of the 12 volunteers (50-148%) and enhancement of enzyme-mediated binding of BP to DNA was detected in most subjects. Hair follicles were shown to convert BP to several metabolic species including BP 7,8-diol, a major precursor of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of BP. Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol itself was also metabolized by the human hair follicles in this system. Clotrimazole, a known inhibitor of the metabolism of BP as well as the carcinogenicity of the hydrocarbon in rodent skin, was found to inhibit AHH and the in vitro metabolism of BP and BP 7,8-diol in human hair follicles. Oral administration of a similar antifungal imidazole, ketoconazole at a dose of 200 mg daily for 5 days, to healthy volunteers also resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of hair follicle AHH activity. These studies indicate that hair follicles represent an accessible tissue suitable for assessing the extent of PAH carcinogen metabolism in human subjects. Furthermore, enzyme activity critical to cancer induction by PAHs was shown to be inducible following the use of a CCT-containing shampoo. This carcinogen-activating enzyme system was substantially inhibited by imidazole compounds, suggesting that they may prove effective as anticarcinogens in human populations.\r"

Topical application of 4-S-CAP on the skin of black guinea pigs revealed a marked depigmentation of black skin. 4-S-Cysteinylphenol also showed some depigmenting potency. 2-S-Cysteinylhydroquinone, which was made by combining cystine with HQ, on the other hand, did not show any depigmenting effect. Depigmentation of black skin by 4-S-CAP appeared to derive from: a decrease in the number of functioning melanocytes; a decrease in the number of melanosomes synthesized within the melanocytes and transferred to keratinocytes; and destruction of the membranous organelles of the melanocytes. None of these degenerative changes was observed in the keratinocytes, indicating the selective effect of 4-S-CAP on melanocytes.\r"

These changes are coupled with alterations in epidermal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase activities, despite the absence of erythema clinically. The use of a sunscreen did not completely prevent these changes. In this study, we have examined the effects of repeated irradiation of human skin with either UVB or UVA alone in order to compare the changes produced in the epidermis and to ascertain whether UVA irradiation could cause these. Irradiation with either UVB or UVA alone was found to increase the mean epidermal thickness, the mean stratum corneum thickness, and mean keratinocyte height significantly. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was significantly increased throughout the epidermis, and succinic dehydrogenase activity was significantly decreased. The autoradiographic labeling index was significantly increased following UVB irradiation but not following UVA irradiation. These results demonstrate that UVA alone can have a direct effect on epidermal morphology and metabolism, suggesting that protection of skin from UV radiation should include adequate protection from UVA.\r"

  ".W": "A new method is presented for controlled removal of the stratum corneum of human skin. An excimer laser (193 nm wavelength, 14 ns pulsewidth) was used to remove stratum corneum from in vitro human skin samples by an ablative process. The tritiated water (3H2O) permeability constant and electrical resistance of skin samples were measured in a diffusion chamber apparatus to quantify the enhancement of skin permeability. Each laser pulse ablates about a micrometer of stratum corneum, which allows controlled removal of tissue. The maximum specific enhancement of the 3H2O permeability constant obtained after complete stratum corneum removal depends on the laser pulse energy used. The most gentle laser ablation, achieved with a radiant exposure of 70 mJ/cm2 per pulse, produced a 124-fold enhancement, which is comparable to that achieved after stratum corneum removal by tape-stripping or removal of epidermis by mild heat treatment. Rapid tissue ablation occurred at higher radiant exposures of 170-480 mJ/cm2 per pulse, but only a 45-fold enhancement of permeability was achieved. The precision with which stratum corneum can be ablated using excimer laser pulses may allow further basic research on the internal structure of stratum corneum and on the re-epithelization in controlled wounds. The technique may prove useful clinically to enhance percutaneous transport in applications such as topical delivery of drugs, patch testing, and percutaneous blood gas monitoring.\r"

In rats with periodontal disease, extractions resulted in a 48% (14 of 29) incidence of bacterial endocarditis, most cases of which were due to Streptococcus spp. (one was caused by Staphylococcus aureus). In contrast, when the teeth with a healthy periodontium were extracted, only 6% (one of 15) of the rats developed endocarditis. When catheters were placed in animals with periodontal disease but no extractions were performed, no endocarditis occurred.\r"

The symptoms (fever, chills, malaise, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms) and signs (tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension) of septicemic plague are similar to those of other forms of gram-negative septicemia. Abdominal pain was reported in nearly half of the cases, and differential white blood cell counts revealed a marked shift to the left. The risk of developing septicemic plague was higher for persons greater than 40 years of age. Because of empirical antibiotic treatment of older persons, deaths from septicemic plague occurred primarily among persons less than 30 years old. Deaths from septicemic plague could be reduced by aggressive antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical presentation suggesting gram-negative septicemia, especially patients less than 30 years old.\r"

Free monomeric HBV DNA was present in three patients with AH and six with FH, and free oligomers were identified in three patients with AH. Results from two patients with AH and seven with FH suggested the presence of dimeric or multimeric HBV DNA. Thus, the various forms of HBV DNA previously described in chronic HBV carriers may be observed at the acute stage of the viral infection. After comparing serological and hybridization data, we found that nine of 19 patients (one with AH and eight with FH) lacking serum HBV surface antigen might have had acute hepatitis related to infection with HBV or HBV variants.\r"

  ".W": "Although metabolic acidosis produces calciuric, phosphaturic, and magnesiuric effects, the consequences of chronic respiratory acidosis are unclear. To examine the role of systemic pH on renal divalent metabolism, 4-day balance studies were performed in rats with both metabolic acidosis induced by adding 1.5% NH4Cl to the drinking water, and respiratory acidosis produced by exposure to 10% atmospheric CO2 in an environmental chamber, and in controls pair-fed with each group. By the fourth day, blood pH had decreased to an identical degree with both chronic metabolic and respiratory acidosis and averaged 7.28. As anticipated, chronic metabolic acidosis resulted in significant calciuria, magnesiuria, and phosphaturia. However, despite the similar decrement in blood pH, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium excretion was similar to that in the pair-fed controls with chronic respiratory acidosis. These findings indicate that a low systemic pH, per se, does not account for the modifications in urinary divalent ion handling that accompany chronic metabolic acidosis. However, additional observations suggest that differences in the intracellular pH of the proximal tubular epithelium may be an important regulatory variable.\r"

  ".W": "Acidification in the collecting tubule is thought to be mediated by a proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and is modulated by aldosterone. Using an enzymatic microassay, we measured N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive ATPase activity in isolated tubules obtained from control rats and rats receiving aldosterone by osmotic minipumps (5 micrograms/100 gm/day for 7 days). In control animals, enzyme activity was higher in cortical than in outer medullary collecting tubules (259 +/- 36 vs. 111 +/- 16 pmol/mm/hr, P less than 0.005, respectively). Prolonged aldosterone administration resulted in an increase in enzyme activity in the outer medullary collecting tubule (274 +/- 39 pmol/mm/hr, P less than 0.005), with no change in the cortical collecting tubule (255 +/- 47 pmol/mm/hr). These findings suggest that prolonged enhancement of acidification by mineralocorticoids is mediated by different mechanisms in the two segments of the rat collecting tubule. Whereas in the outer medullary segment an increase in the activity of NEM-sensitive ATPase facilitates the chronic enhancement in acidification, high basal enzyme activity in the cortical segment and institution of favorable voltage condition by mineralocorticoid treatment may obviate the need to increase enzyme activity.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of aluminum injections on bones of rats after intervals of 3, 6, and 9 weeks. To study reversibility, we allowed one group to recover for 3 weeks. Both weanling and adult rats were examined to determine the influence of age. The calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone levels were similar in aluminum-treated rats and controls. Aluminum could be seen by histochemical stain after 6 weeks, but at that time the bone was otherwise normal. By 9 weeks the bone formation (as measured by tetracycline labeling) in aluminum-treated rats was severely decreased on trabecular and endosteal surfaces. The periosteal surfaces showed normal formation. After 3 weeks of recovery, the bone formation rate in the young aluminum-treated rats was similar to that in the controls, although the serum and bone aluminum values had not significantly decreased. A higher percentage of aluminum was seen in the cement lines. In the adult rats, the bones had more stainable aluminum, and increased osteoid was noted along trabecular and periosteal surfaces. The doses of aluminum used in these rats greatly exceeded those that cause toxicity in humans; thus these findings may not directly apply to clinical practice. We conclude that aluminum administration can lead to decreased rates of bone formation in the rat, despite normal calcium level and renal function, and without decreased parathyroid hormone levels. The peritoneal route of administration could also have contributed to bone lesions by causing peritonitis, malabsorption, or both. Adult rats showed signs of early osteomalacia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dietary calcium (CA++) supplementation attenuates gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats. It has been proposed that this protective effect results from the ability of Ca++ to interfere with gentamicin binding to renal cell membranes. However, calcium supplementation also suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity, which may affect gentamicin nephrotoxicity by altering renal brush border phospholipid composition or renal calcium handling. We therefore compared gentamicin nephrotoxicity in PTH-stimulated control rats and parathyroidectomized (PTX) rats. Although their pretreatment serum ionized calcium concentration was significantly higher (1.27 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.06 mmol/L; P less than 0.001), PTH-stimulated rats had higher peak renal cortical gentamicin concentrations (543 +/- 20 vs. 395 +/- 49 micrograms/gm; P less than 0.025) and serum creatinine concentrations (3.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 mg/dl; P less than 0.05). Structural injury and depression of renal cortical slice uptake of p-aminohippurate were also less severe in PTX rats. Gentamicin treatment also caused increased urinary Ca++ excretion in control rats (from 2.12 +/- 0.64 mumol/mg creatinine per day [pretreatment] to 16.86 +/- 2.07 mumol/mg creatinine per day; P less than 0.001) but not in PTX rats. Control rats ingesting chow containing a standard Ca++ content (1.2%) resembled PTX rats. These results indicate that PTH stimulation exacerbates gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Increased peak renal cortical gentamicin concentrations in PTH-stimulated rats may be caused by increased gentamicin transport across the brush border as a consequence of PTH-mediated alteration of plasma membrane phospholipid composition, turnover, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coded sera were analyzed for P-III-P concentrations by both a standard radioimmunoassay and a recently developed and potentially more precise radioimmunoassay that uses Fab fragments rather than intact antibodies for binding antigen. As compared with conditions in 22 normal controls, P-III-P concentrations were elevated in 98% and 72% of patients with CAH by use of the standard and Fab radioimmunoassays, respectively. With treatment, P-III-P levels fell at remission to levels that were not significantly different from control values, as measured by both assays. The Fab radioimmunoassay, either alone or combined with the standard radioimmunoassay, provided no advantage over the standard radioimmunoassay alone. Serum P-III-P levels, as measured by either assay, correlated poorly or not at all with standard liver function tests and with histologic grade of disease. These data suggest that P-III-P serum levels are abnormal in severe CAH but normalize when remission of disease has been achieved. Consequently, serum P-III-P levels may be a diagnostic aid in the sequential evaluation of patients with severe CAH requiring treatment, and this test deserves further investigation. In this regard, the standard P-III-P assay has greater diagnostic accuracy than the Fab assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that even in the absence of steatorrhea, a majority of patients with advanced liver injury (alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or both) had abnormal TBT results that failed to correct with pancreatic extract. In contrast, patients with less severe lesions (steatosis) had results that were not significantly different from those in normal controls. Inasmuch as the abnormal TBT results in patients with advanced alcohol-induced lesions did not correct with pancreatic extract, the test may not accurately differentiate pancreatic from nonpancreatic steatorrhea in some alcoholics.\r"

Aliquots of the extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein were applied to 8% to 15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Similar aliquots were subjected to isoelectric focusing and to gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. All electrophoretic gels were autoradiographed. A concentration-dependent effect of ADR, ACT, and MIT on protein and on actin synthesis was found in cultured myocytes with decreased density of radiolabeled actin band in CMC exposed to either 10(-5) mol/L ADR, or from 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L ACT, or from 10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L MIT. Autoradiographs of two-dimensional gels focused actin isoforms but showed substantial decreases of all actin isoforms in CMC extracts from 10(-7) mol/L ACT. ACT and MIT each decreased CMC protein synthesis by 20% at 10(-8) mol/L. At 10(-6) mol/L ADR, synthesis of alpha-actin was diminished preferentially compared with beta and gamma. Synthesis of all actin isoforms was diminished at 10(-5) mol/L ADR.

To define the effects of hyponatremia on the hemodynamic response to volume depletion in the setting of uremia, isolated ultrafiltration was performed in acutely uremic dogs previously rendered hyponatremic (127 + 2.5 [SD] mEq/L) for 72 hours by dialyzing against a low-sodium dialysate. Response was compared with that of the same animals in the normonatremic (150 +/- 3.6 mEq/L) condition. Animals in the hyponatremic and normonatremic states had similar initial values of blood volume (hyponatremic 2284 +/- 338 ml, normonatremic 2306 +/- 372 ml, P not significant), mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance, but preultrafiltration body weight in the hyponatremic state was greater (hyponatremic 26.1 +/- 2.4 kg, normonatremic 24.6 +/- 1.7 kg, P less than 0.05). Isolated ultrafiltration was performed until a 30% fall in mean arterial pressure occurred. Body weight at the end of ultrafiltration in the hyponatremic state was still higher (24.7 +/- 2.4 kg) than in the normonatremic state (22.9 +/- 1.5 kg, P less than 0.05). At the end of ultrafiltration, similar values of blood volume (hyponatremic 1871 + 329 ml, normonatremic 1821 +/- 267, P not significant) cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were again found. The results suggest that, in this model, hyponatremia is associated with an alteration in the relationship between body water and blood volume. The excess body water is difficult to remove by isolated ultrafiltration because blood volume depletion ensues at a higher body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recently, however, immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies to growth hormone have been commercially introduced. This study compares growth hormone levels obtained with two new monoclonal assays with levels obtained with a standard polyclonal assay. In 20 patients, the polyclonal assay (National Pituitary Agency) measured a mean growth hormone concentration of 14.0 +/- 10 (SD) ng/dl compared with monoclonal assay 1 (Hybritech) measurement of 10.4 +/- 7.2 ng/dl (P less than 0.01) and monoclonal 2 (Wellcome Co.) measurement of 18.9 +/- 9.8 ng/dl (P less than 0.01). The Hybritech monoclonal assay measured lower growth hormone levels than the polyclonal assay in all 20 patients. The Wellcome assay measured higher growth hormone levels than the polyclonal assay in 17 of 20 patients. There is not complete agreement between polyclonal and monoclonal antibody growth hormone assays in their measurement of plasma growth hormone levels. Clinicians using the new monoclonal antibody growth hormone assays will need to carefully develop separate diagnostic criteria for growth hormone deficiency that takes into account the disparity between the polyclonal assays that were used in the development of the current diagnostic standards and the new monoclonal antibody assays.\r"

The concentrate, purified to homogeneity as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate--gel electrophoresis, was a 2:1 mixture of functional ATIII with heparin cofactor activity and dysfunctional ATIII incapable of binding enzymes or heparin. Each subject received intravenously a dose of 75 U/kg of ATIII activity together with iodine 125-labeled tracer. Daily fractional catabolic rates calculated from the three-exponential disappearance curves of plasma radioactivity were similar in all investigated subjects and were within the range obtained in studies using functionally homogeneous tracer. Although all subjects had markedly increased ATIII levels after injection of the concentrate, the relative sizes of their ATIII distribution pools resembled those reported previously for people with normal ATIII concentration. There was, however, a noticeably faster disappearance from plasma of excess functional ATIII compared with that of ATIII antigen, with mean half-lives of 47.5 +/- 9 hours and 62.3 +/- 8 hours, respectively. Assuming that antigenic ATIII represented both functional inhibitor and dysfunctional ATIII incapable of binding heparin, these data are consistent with the supposition that interaction with endogenous heparin or a similar substance may regulate a catabolic pathway marking ATIII for destruction.\r"

These changes in the caloric and rotation tests were statistically significant. Lidocaine also appeared to have altered the balance between the two sides in the vestibulo-spinal system as indicated by the results of the stepping test during craniocorpography.

For these patients bleeding from tumor represents a devastating complication that can abruptly terminate the course of an otherwise chronic disease, albeit a uniformly fatal one. The technique we describe renders a relatively safe and effective treatment that seems to control this problem. We report on our experience with three patients whose tumor bleeding was controlled by permanent intra-arterial embolization with Ivalon, a polyvinyl alcohol-based foam. The technique, indications, and complications are discussed.\r"

Close follow-up after primary treatment is essential since there is a high possibility of recurrent disease but which may respond well to salvage surgery if identified early.

Bronchitis patients were more likely to have a previous history of asthma, a personal history or diagnosis of atopic disease, and more previous and subsequent visits for acute bronchitis. The main finding of the study was a tenfold increase in the subsequent visit rate for asthma in the acute bronchitis group. Thirty percent of patients with acute bronchitis made return visits for unresolved cough despite an 83 percent rate of antibiotic use. These findings challenge the common belief that the symptoms of acute bronchitis are solely infectious in origin and suggest the involvement of occult bronchospasm.\r"

Sufficient clinical experience exists with both ceftriaxone and cefonicid to recommend these agents for selected patients having pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, or soft tissue infections. Cefonicid, perhaps in combination with erythromycin, will provide excellent coverage for complicated community-acquired pneumonias. Ceftriaxone is effective as single-dose therapy for even complicated gonococcal infections.

Sixty-nine percent of the patients received no treatment, 29 percent were treated with diet, and 7 percent with drug therapy. Family physicians were much more likely to recognize and somewhat more likely to treat hypercholesterolemia if the level was greater than 305 mg/dL and, therefore, marked as abnormal on the laboratory report. An educational program to improve physician management of hypercholesterolemia had no significant effect. Although further education using different teaching approaches may be helpful, the use of optimal rather than statistically \"normal\" cholesterol ranges by the laboratory may be a better way to improve physician performance.\r"

Family enrollment levels were documented during a study period from June 1981 to September 1982, and again in June 1984. Both before and after the intervention efforts, family enrollment levels remained the same. It was concluded that the educational interventions used were unsuccessful in both short-term and long-term follow-up. Only one subgroup that participated in a specific educational intervention (patient orientation groups) showed an increase in family enrollment.\r"

It is practiced by over two thirds of the second- and third-year residents in programs that monitor moonlighting. These residents spend an average of 28 hours each month moonlighting. The most commonly used moonlighting sites are hospital emergency rooms, followed by coverage for private practice physicians. Seventy percent of programs require approval for extracurricular work activity.

The degree of impairment was not related to severity of motor disability, but correlated strongly with the results of tests that measured visuospatial and visuoperceptive abilities. It is suggested that defective encoding and central processing of visuospatial information impairs memory for movement which is necessary for correct imitation of movements. Enhanced vulnerability to interference between successively presented items may cause further deterioration of performance in the copying of movement sequences.\r"

When normal subjects made movements through 60 degrees, the first agonist burst of EMG activity in the wrist flexor muscles was longer and larger than that seen in movements of 15 degrees. If a large opposing load of 2.2 Nm was added, this also increased the size and duration of the first agonist EMG burst. Although the movements made by the patients were slower than those of normals, the size and duration of the first agonist EMG burst changed with movement size and added load in the normal way. This shows that patients can produce large, long bursts of EMG activity, but that there is a failure to match these parameters appropriately to the size of movement required. The effect of levodopa therapy on the movements was not dramatic. Although patients produced faster wrist movements when on medication than when off, the change was relatively small compared with the change seen in their overall clinical rating. Changes in the velocity of movements at a single joint are not a good reflection of the overall clinical state of patients with Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Parkinson's disease patients have been shown to have abnormal visually evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) to pattern stimulation. Whereas dopamine is not an important neurotransmitter in the central visual pathways, the retina is rich in dopamine and, together with previous animal and human studies, this suggests that the abnormal VEPs in Parkinson's disease patients may be due to a biochemical and electrophysiological disorder in the retina. This hypothesis has been examined by studying the VEPs and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) of Parkinson's disease patients and matched control subjects. The amplitudes of the cortical and retinal evoked potentials were significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease patients compared with the control subjects and this could not be attributed to any particular feature of the disease or its treatment. There was a significant relationship between the VEP P100 latency and the PERG amplitude. Moreover for those subjects in whom there was an interocular difference in both cortical and retinal evoked potentials, the abnormality was more commonly found in the potentials from the same eye. These findings suggest that the abnormality of the VEP in Parkinson's disease patients is, at least in part, secondary to an abnormality of the retina itself.\r"

It was found that the relationship between the extra force generated by the twitch and the level of voluntary contraction was independent of the percentage of the muscle stimulated. The technique was used to study activation of the quadriceps and biceps in a group of young healthy adults, and quadriceps activation in patients with musculo-skeletal disorders. The majority of subjects could fully activate their muscles during brief isometric contractions. Inhibition was demonstrated in patients with muscle pain and joint pathology and in subjects with a previous history of knee or joint injury. The technique is easy to use and provides a simple way of detecting inhibition where it might not be anticipated, such as in the absence of pain. Where inhibition is demonstrated the technique can be used to predict approximately the maximum force available.\r"

The immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated the fascicular organization of pyramidal cell apical dendrites. Senile plaques were located between dendritic clusters with pyramidal cell apical dendritic shafts excluded from plaques. The close correlation between plaque diameter and interfascicular distances suggests that the boundaries of the vertically organized bundles may be an architectural constraint on plaque size.\r"

We report the morphologic and histochemical characteristics of these striatal neurons and their distribution with respect to the histochemical compartments as defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Sections of striatum were stained histochemically for NADPH-d and AChE and immunocytochemically for somatostatin and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity. The diaphorase end-product was contained within medium-sized neurons which corresponded morphologically to a category of aspiny interneurons. Combined techniques showed that NADPH-d, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y coexisted within the same neurons in controls and patients with HD. The density of these neurons was greater in the ventral putamen and the nucleus accumbens than in the remainder of the striatum. The distinctive AChE pattern of high and low enzyme activity was altered in HD. The AChE-rich matrix zone was markedly reduced in size, while the total area of zones of low enzyme activity was not different from that found in control striatum. The relation between these AChE chemical compartments and the distribution of preserved diaphorase neurons remained intact; NADPH-d neurons were predominantly observed in the matrix zone.\r"

Compared to age-matched controls, pyramidal neuronal RNA was depressed (p less than 0.0001) in all areas of the hippocampus examined in AD, viz., the endplate (33%), Rose's H2 field (30%), Rose's H1 field (37%) and the subiculum (46%). Significant neuronal loss was observed in Rose's H1 field and the subiculum but not in the endplate or Rose's H2 field. The frequency of neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons was enhanced in all four regions of AD brains, the number of involved neurons being markedly greater in Rose's H1 field and the subiculum than in the endplate and Rose's H2 field. Overall, the data indicate the existence of a generalized disturbance in RNA metabolism within pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus in AD, occurring in regions of minimal (endplate, Rose's H2 field) as well as those of extensive (Rose's H1 field, subiculum) pathological alterations. Although there is focal accentuation of RNA depletion in the latter, the marked RNA depletion in regions of minimal pathologic change suggests that this effect is largely unrelated to local neuronal loss or neurofibrillary degeneration.\r"

Their perikarya were usually smaller in size than those of normal-looking ones and almost invariably had central chromatolysis-like changes, suggesting an intimate pathomorphological relationship between the perikarya and their processes. Although it was difficult to determine whether these small processes were atrophic dendrites or shrunken axons, some were recognized as dendrites from their multiple branchings and some were identified as axons from their tapering configuration followed by widening of the distal portion. Aggregates of lipofuscin were almost always present in the perikaryal portion from which an atrophic process arose. In addition, the somewhat argentophilic slender cytoplasm which in normal neurons separates lipofuscin from the cell surface and merges with the proximal part of a process, was prominently attenuated. The small processes were more frequently observed in cases with many spheroids and chromatolytic neurons. The change in the proximal portion of the processes may implicate some disturbance of functional connection between the soma and the cell processes in ALS.\r"

There was no reaction with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) serum or anti-S-100 protein serum. In these neoplasms TEM displayed extracellular basement membrane-like material (BMLM), cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IF) associated with a dense body, dilated rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum containing BMLM, a small area of interdigitation of cell membranes, and a unique intercellular punctate or linear density. By SEM these tumors had intercellular shell-like or reticular structures and irregularly branched capillaries which were compressed by ellipsoidal- or carrot-shaped tumor cells. Short-term monolayer culture showed rapid and vigorous growth of tumor cells, and the formation of pseudolumens but not of whorls. The TEM of cultured cells also showed cytoplasmic IF associated with the dense body. By SEM the cultured cells were flat and had a discoid nucleus with conspicuous nucleolar hillocks. Our results show that HM are mainly poorly specialized mesenchyme-related tumors of the meninges; some possess a potential for aggressive growth and some for differentiation into smooth muscle cells. Further study is needed to determine their histogenesis.\r"

We have investigated axonal transport in experimental PNU (N-3-pyridylmethyl-N'-p-nitrophenylurea; Vacor) neuropathy, because of the rapid and synchronous degeneration of many terminal axons after a single dose of PNU. Almost all axon terminals at neuromuscular junctions in hindfoot muscles degenerated by 24 hours after the administration of PNU. Fewer affected axons were found in intramuscular nerve twigs, and fewer still in the posterior tibial nerves. No abnormal myelinated axons were found in the sciatic nerve in the thigh. Fast axonal transport in the sciatic nerve remained normal to the mid-thigh, but a reduced amount of labeled transported material reached the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle (27% reduction). Autoradiography showed that nearly no transported material reached the intramuscular nerves and neuromuscular junctions of the hindfeet. These results suggest that toxic impairment of fast anterograde axonal transport may contribute to the axonal degeneration produced by PNU.\r"

Previous techniques have assumed that the attenuation coefficient of water for 99mTc (0.15/cm) should be used for this correction. In this study, this assumption was tested directly by measuring attenuation of the activity of a radioactive source within the right and left cardiac chambers. The balloon of a flow-directed catheter, filled with 99mTc, was used as a source and its depth within the body was measured with biplane fluoroscopy. In ten patients, a total of 36 measurements of attenuation were made. With linear regression analysis, the overall calculated attenuation coefficient, mu, was 0.12/cm (standard error of slope = 0.01, R = 0.93). Although the mean value of mu varied from 0.08 to 0.13 for four different intracardiac locations these differences were not significant. These direct measurements indicate that the attenuation of photons in the heart is not equivalent to that of water and suggest that an attenuation coefficient of 0.12/cm should be used in analyzing ventricular activity.\r"

We prospectively studied 68 patients undergoing three-phase bone scintigraphy to evaluate the frequency and magnitude of this artifact. The results showed that when a blood-pressure cuff was applied virtually all patients demonstrated increased activity in the extremity of cuff application. When a simple rubber tourniquet was applied few patients demonstrated the artifact. Only one patient, a case of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, had increased uptake on blood-pool and skeletal-phase images. We recommend that in flow studies of the hands, wrists, and forearms, blood pressure cuffs not be employed and that at least 3 min should elapse between release of the occlusive device and injection. Asymmetry of flow under these conditions is unlikely to be artifact.\r"

In a very limited number of cases increased perfusion to the affected side has been noted. We report a case of metachronous torsion of both the appendices testis. In each instance, there was decreased tracer uptake on the affected side, suggestive of early torsion of the testicle. The sequential involvement of each testis with a nine month interval between respective torsions provides a unique example where each testis serves, sequentially, as a normal control for the torsed contralateral appendage.\r"

To evaluate [99mTc]CPI as a myocardial imaging agent in the human, we evaluated this tracer in three normals and in six patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In normals, [99mTc]CPI cleared quickly from the lungs and accumulated in the liver and heart. The liver activity peaked at 10-15 min and cleared through the hepatobiliary system. Planar images were of excellent technical quality with high myocardial to background ratios as early as 10 min after injection. Myocardial activity fell gradually to 76.1 +/- 2.9 (s.d.)% of initial activity by 60 min after injection. In six patients with CAD, myocardial defects were present on planar images up to 2 hr after exercise and injection. In one out of six patients, the defect was not seen 3 hr after injection. In five of the six patients, normal perfusion patterns were observed 1 hr after reinjection of CPI at rest (4 hr after the initial injection). In one patient who developed spontaneous angina prior to reinjection, the perfusion defects persisted. The repeat study 3 days later with injection of [99mTc]CPI at rest was normal. Technetium-99m CPI appears to have excellent physical and biologic properties for use in association with myocardial imaging with exercise.\r"

Each patient received a single. i.v. infusion of MoAb at concentrations ranging from 1 mg to 20 mg, coupled to 5 mCi 111In by the chelating agent DPTA. No toxicity was observed in any patient. Total-body and regions of interest scans performed at 4, 24, and 72 hr following MoAb administration revealed uptake in 63 out of 105 previously diagnosed metastases for an overall sensitivity of 60%. Uptake was consistently observed in liver/spleen, and less frequently in bowel, testes, axillae and bone. Sensitivity of detection increased significantly at doses of MoAb above 2.5 mg, with 74% of lesions imaging at 20 mg/5 mCi compared with 29% at 2.5 mg/5 mCi (p less than 0.005). A significant correlation was observed between tumor uptake of 111In-MoAb conjugate and increasing tumor size. Soft-tissue lesions such as skin and lymph node metastases were imaged to a greater extent (76%) than visceral metastases (19%). In five of six patients, biopsies obtained from 3 days to 14 days after MoAb administration showed antibody present on tumor cells as demonstrated by flow cytometry and/or radioimmunoassay. Human anti-murine immunoglobulin responses were observed in seven of 17 patients studied. Mean plasma clearance of ZME-018 was prolonged with a T1/2 of 24.7 hr and increased slightly with increasing MoAb dose. Urinary excretion of 111In averaged 12.4% of the injected dose over 48 hours. Radioimmunolocalization of melanoma with 111In-labeled ZME-018 appears feasible. The sensitivity of the technique was related to dose, tumor size, and disease site.\r"

Five patients had no metastases though one was image positive. Four other nondiseased inguinal node groups were image negative. A total of 28 tumored nodes and 110 normal nodes were removed, counted and histologically examined. All metastatic tumors expressed antigen against which the specific Fab was directed. The concentrations of both specific and nonspecific Fab were similar in tumored nodes and both were significantly greater than in normal nodes showed essentially identical intranodal spatial distribution of the specific and control Fab in areas containing tumor. These preliminary results suggest the increased concentration of murine immunoglobulin (Fab) retained in diseased nodes was a nonspecific phenomenon.\r"

Antibodies passed rapidly and very efficiently from the feet to the inguinal-femoral and iliac lymph nodes after s.c. administration. Contrasting patterns of uptake were seen in patients with different lymph node histology, but additional experience will be required to test the possible correlation with degree of lymph node involvement. This technique provides an efficient, noninvasive method for imaging normal and abnormal lymphoid elements in regional lymph nodes, and it may prove useful in the evaluation of patients with lymphoma or other lymph node disorders.\r"

The higher lipophilicity of brominated misonidazole increased its concentration in the hypoxic portion of tumors at 2 hr, but high blood levels contributed to excessive background, incompatible with imaging. Hydrogen-3-fluoromisonidazole diffused into tumors at a slower rate than misonidazole but it also cleared from normal tissues so that after 2 hr tumor-to-blood ratios favorable for imaging were achieved. In the compounds that were studied, fluorine at the end of the alkyl chain is more stable in vivo than bromine on the imidazole ring. Our results indicate that [18F] fluoromisonidazole may be a useful tracer for imaging hypoxia at approximately 4 hr after injection.\r"

Cholesterol content of diet is greater than average United States consumption per kilogram body weight but is very similar on a per-kilocalorie intake basis. Both beef and soy diets contained more cholesterol (0.09% by weight vs. 0%) and fat (40-50% of calories vs. 8-9%) than did conventional diets. Dried egg yolk was the source of cholesterol in the soy diets. Beef- and soy-fed pigs had greater plasma, HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations than did conventionally fed pigs; beef-fed pigs had greater plasma, HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations than did soy-fed pigs in trial 2 only. Final HDL-to-LDL cholesterol ratios did not differ. Neutral steroid and bile acid excretion was twofold greater in soy-fed than in conventionally or beef-fed pigs in trial 2 only. Differences in cholesterol concentrations were found in liver (soy, beef greater than conventional) and heart (soy greater than beef, conventional) in trial 1 and in liver (soy, beef greater than conventional), adipose tissue (soy greater than conventional greater than beef) and aorta and other viscera (conventional greater than soy, beef) in trial 2. In both trials, soy-fed pigs had greatest whole-body cholesterol concentrations. Thus, in both trials, disposition of cholesterol was similar in conventionally fed and beef-fed pigs, despite greater cholesterol intake in the latter, but was greater soy-fed pigs.\r"

  ".W": "Weanling rats were fed high fat diets containing 40% of energy as fat for 23 d. Diets were formulated to contain equivalent content of essential nutrients per calorie for the nonfat components. Four oil mixtures provided high dietary levels of either oleic, linoleic, linolenic or erucic acid. Effect of dietary fatty acid composition on the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin isolated from cardiac mitochondria was examined in conjunction with the effect of diet on the oxidative activity of cardiac mitochondria. Dietary treatments that reduced the content of C16:0 in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of phosphatidylcholine were associated with increased content of C20:1 and C22:1 fatty acids into the sn-2 position and resulted in decreased oxidative activity of cardiac mitochondria utilizing palmitylcarnitine as a substrate for oxidation. Diets high in linoleic acid did not increase membrane phospholipid content of omega 3 fatty acids, but resulted in decreased level of C20:4 omega 6. In a subsequent perfusion experiment, hearts were removed from animals fed either high erucic or high linoleic acid diets and were perfused to examine rates of fatty acid oxidation and simultaneous synthesis of high energy phosphate compounds in cardiac muscle. Diet did not affect the levels of creatine phosphate or adenine nucleotides present in the tissue on a per-gram-wet-weight basis, but production of 14CO2 from beta-oxidation of palmitic acid was lower for animals fed the high erucic acid diet than for those fed the high linoleic acid diet. Since this diet did not alter oxidation of palmitylcarnitine in vitro and as beta-oxidation of lauric acid was not decreased in the perfused heart, we conclude that mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acid was not altered by diet and that low rates observed for palmitate oxidation are attributable to reduced palmitylcarnitine synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the mineral composition of mare milk during lactation were studied. Milk samples were obtained from five Thoroughbred mares one to three times weekly from the first to the eighth week of lactation and from two of the mares for an additional 8 wk. Samples averaging 500 mL were obtained after oxytocin was administered to the mares. Each sample was analyzed for total solids, ash, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, copper and zinc. The concentration of all constituents except sodium and potassium decreased throughout lactation. The rates of decline of ash, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium concentration were similar, but the rates of decline of the other elements differed. Thus, the mineral composition of mare milk should be described in terms of the stage of lactation of the mare. The total solids and ash content of mare milk were 12 and 0.61% respectively, at the end of the first week of lactation, 10.5 and 0.45% at 4 wk, 10 and 0.38% at 8 wk and 10.2 and 0.32% at 16 wk. The calcium, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations at the end of the same periods were 1345, 943 and 118 micrograms/g of milk at 1 wk; 1070, 659 and 86 at 4 wk; 831, 574 and 58 at 8 wk and 700, 540 and 43 micrograms/g of milk at 16 wk. Copper and zinc concentrations were 0.85 and 3.1, 0.55 and 2.2, 0.29 and 1.9 and 0.28 and 1.8 microgram/g of milk at 1, 4, 8 and 16 wk, respectively.\r"

The hypothesis that zinc may be released from body tissues when the metabolic state is altered was further tested. Nonpregnant Sprague-Dawley females were injected with 65Zn; after equilibration, the two major pools of zinc, bone and muscle had different specific activities, muscle being much higher. Females were mated and fed diets adequate in zinc and calcium, deficient in zinc alone or deficient in both zinc and calcium. Calculations using weight loss, zinc content of maternal bone and muscle and total zinc content of the fetus at term indicated that most of the zinc in the fetus at term in both the zinc-deficient and zinc-calcium-deficient groups came from breakdown of maternal muscle in the last 3 d of pregnancy. The relatively small amount of additional zinc released from bone in the zinc-calcium-deficient rats early in pregnancy was sufficient to prevent abnormal organogenesis. Specific activity of zinc in the zinc-deficient and zinc-calcium-deficient fetuses was equal and high, indicating that most zinc in these fetuses came from maternal tissues and from the same maternal sources in both groups. In contrast, specific activity of zinc in the fetuses from rats fed adequate zinc and calcium was less than 30% of that in either of the deficient groups; this is consistent with the hypothesis that most zinc accrued by these fetuses came directly from the diet.\r"

Two pigs per treatment after either 5 (T5) or 10 (T10) wk and four pigs per treatment after 15 (T15) wk were slaughtered, and the femur (F) and third (MT3) and fourth (MT4) metatarsal bones were collected for evaluation of mechanical properties (force, stress and modulus of elasticity), ash weight (ASHW), percent ash (PASH) and bone mineral content (BMC) using photon absorptiometry. Stepwise regression analysis utilized to generate best-fit equations predicted that dietary Ca and P levels could reliably predict force (R2 = 0.83), ASHW (R2 = 0.93) and BMC (R2 = 0.89) of the MT3 bones but the prediction of force differed at the various time periods. Stress (R2 = 0.41), the modulus of elasticity (R2 = 0.29) and PASH (R2 = 0.17) were not reliably predicted by dietary mineral levels. The amount of force withstood by the MT3 bone could be reliably predicted by BMC (R2 = 0.90), but stress was not reliably predicted by BMC (R2 = 0.40) even if dietary Ca levels were considered. These results indicated that dietary Ca levels between 0.6% and 1.2% and dietary P levels between 0.6% and 0.8% did not adversely affect growth, efficiency or bone development. The BMC, as determined by photon absorptiometry, was not a reliable predictor of bone strength.\r"

  ".W": "The luminal phase of zinc intestinal absorption may be mediated by low-molecular-weight substances originated in digestive, metabolic or secretory processes. Amino acids are considered primary candidates for this role through the formation of complexes with zinc. However, structural characteristics that may be indispensable for this physiological function have not been explored in vivo. We investigated the comparative effectiveness of four amino acids and their respective chemically related homologues on the absorption of zinc by the jejunum, ileum and colon of the rat using a perfusion procedure. L-Tryptophan (Trp) allowed for significantly greater zinc absorption than tryptophol (Tpl) in all areas of the gut. L-Histidine (His) and imidazole (Imd) had similar effects in both the jejunum and the ileum. Imd allowed for much greater zinc absorption from the colon than did His (His, 388 +/- 31; Imd, 937 +/- 107 pmol/min X cm, P less than 0.001). Proline (Pro) was a more effective ligand than pyroglutamate (Pyr) in the ileum (Pro, 559 +/- 19; Pyr, 352 +/- 22 pmol/min X cm, P less than 0.001), but not in the jejunum or the colon. L-Cysteine was superior to N-acetyl-L-cysteine only in the ileum (508 +/- 45 vs. 348 +/- 25 pmol/min X cm, P less than 0.01). The greater zinc absorption achieved by amino acids than by non-amino acid homologues in the small intestine appeared to be due to the presence of both mediated and nonmediated transport mechanisms for amino acids but of only nonmediated zinc uptake for the homologues. In the colon, where amino acid absorption does not take place, high structural affinity for zinc, such as that exhibited by Imd, allowed for considerable absorption of the trace element.\r"

Carnitine affects ketogenesis (KG), which is a vital adaptation in the neonate. To determine if KG is impaired by low carnitine in Fe-deficient pup liver, ketone body synthesis was measured in liver mitochondria from 15-d-old pups. Litters from Fe-deficient (-Fe) and Fe-adequate (+Fe) dams were orally supplemented with water (W) as a control, 18 mM ferrous sulfate, or 10 mM L-carnitine from d 8 through d 15 of lactation. The amount of ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate + acetoacetate) synthesized was 68% less (P less than 0.05) in -FeW pups than in +FeW pups. Iron or carnitine supplementation increased KG in -Fe pups to +Fe KG levels, but carnitine did not affect KG in +Fe pups. Liver TG in +Fe pups was not altered by supplementation, but liver TG was -FeW pups. The data support the hypothesis that in the Fe-deficient suckling rat -FeW pups. The data support the hypothesis that in the Fe-deficient suckling rat, low carnitine levels may contribute to impaired ketogenesis and increased lipids in liver.\r"

Carnitine has been effective in reducing high triacylglycerol levels in humans and rats. This study examined tissue triacylglycerol concentrations of iron-deficient rats supplemented with carnitine or iron. Iron-adequate (C) and iron-deficient (D) pups were weaned to diets containing 38 ppm Fe (c) or 6 ppm Fe (d) with or without 0.2% DL-carnitine (Carn) resulting in six experimental treatments: CcCarn, DdCarn, Cc, Cd, Dc, Dd. Males received the diets for 2 wk and female littermates for 4. After 2 and 4 wk, carnitine supplementation significantly increased carnitine content in liver, heart and skeletal muscle by 30-60% in rats from control and Fe-deficient dams. Carnitine treatment significantly lowered the triacylglycerol level in liver of 49-d-old Fe-deficient females, but did not affect other tissues at either time point compared to other dietary treatments. Fe supplementation did not increase carnitine content in tissues, but did reduce triacylglycerol levels in liver by 4 wk and in skeletal muscle at both time points. Possible mechanisms by which iron and carnitine may lower lipids are discussed.\r"

Arterial BCAA concentrations were four- to fivefold and BCKA concentrations were twofold higher in rats fed HP diet than in rats fed basal diet. In rats fed basal diet, a higher proportion (45-58%) of BCKA was removed by the liver than of BCAA (7-12%). Thus, plasma BCKA were probably the major source of substrates for hepatic BCKA dehydrogenase. In rats fed HP diet, hepatic uptake of BCAA was 10 times greater than in rats fed basal diet, owing to their higher extraction; BCKA uptake was only twice as great; thus BCKA were a minor source of substrates for hepatic metabolism. In both diet groups, uptake of ketomethylvalerate (KMV) was less efficient than ketoisovalerate (KIV) or ketoisocaproate (KIC) uptake. Studies of metabolism of intraportal loads of BCKA showed that capacities for KIV and KIC uptake were high, KMV uptake plateaued at lower portal concentrations. With HP diets, the liver may be the major site of BCAA utilization; the interorgan transfer of the carbon moiety of BCAA to the liver as ketoacids does not keep pace with an increased availability of BCAA.\r"

All animal protein was replaced by soy isolate for a fifth 2-d period in two of the subjects. Ileostomy contents were collected in 2-h intervals during the day and in one portion during night and immediately deep-frozen. The fiber components and the phytic acid in the diet were almost completely recovered in the ileostomy contents, whereas unabsorbed starch was less than 2% of the intake. A significantly lower protein digestibility was observed when the diets containing soy protein were fed. No difference in protein digestibility was found between the different soy protein products. A 25% replacement by soy protein had no obvious effect on apparent mineral absorption. A low protein digestibility was also observed when soy was the main source of protein, and a negative apparent absorption of zinc was found in both subjects. Although 25% of soy protein in the diet does not seem to impair mineral absorption significantly, small intestinal net absorption of nitrogen is less from the soy diets than from the meat diet.\r"

  ".W": "Since the severity of copper deficiency has been shown to be enhanced by feeding diets containing fructose but ameliorated by diets containing starch, we decided to investigate the effect of fructose or starch on copper absorption. As copper transport has been reported to occur also from the stomach, it was possible that copper absorption is inhibited by fructose already from that tissue. Under anesthesia, stomachs of 72 rats fed copper-deficient or supplemented diets containing fructose or starch were ligated prior to the oral administration of 64Cu. Gastric absorption of 64Cu was studied when the isotope was administered by gastric tube either in diet containing fructose or starch or in water. 64Cu was not absorbed from the stomach regardless of the type of dietary treatment, copper status or whether the copper was administered either in diet or in water. In addition, the absorption of 64Cu from a diet containing either fructose or starch or from a saline solution was studied using the isolated ligated duodenal loop. When 64Cu was administered with dietary fructose 64Cu retention and absorption were impaired when compared to starch. When 64Cu was administered in saline solution, differences in retention and absorption between the four dietary groups disappeared. It is suggested that the requirements for copper rather than the decreased absorption of copper are responsible at least in part for the more pronounced severity of copper deficiency in rats fed fructose compared to those fed starch.\r"

In trial 2, steers were fed 4.5 kg of a 45:55 concentrate:roughage diet daily across a weight range of 134 to 390 kg. Glucose irreversible loss averaged 820 +/- 32 and 461 +/- 13 mg/min for trials 1 and 2 and was not affected by body size. Thus, glucose irreversible loss seems to be regulated by feed intake when intake is above maintenance. Body size had no effect on glucose total entry rate, recycling or pool size. Blood glucose concentration and glucose space decreased at 0.004 mg X ml-1 X kg-1 and 0.002 fractional units body wt X kg-1 as body size increased. Digestible energy and nitrogen balance were measured in trial 2. Digestibility of energy increased at 0.0054 Mcal X d-1 X kg-1 as body size increased. Nitrogen retention averaged 28.2 g X d-1 and was not influenced by body size even though energy intake approached maintenance amounts at the end of the trial. On the basis of urinary nitrogen excretion data, we conclude that the maximum net contribution of amino acid carbon to glucose synthesis was 8% of glucose carbon.\r"

The daily schedule of food accessibility differed among these three groups: a single meal during early darkness; a single meal during early light; six smaller meals at about 2-h intervals during darkness. Food restriction as such clearly prolonged life, but there were no statistically significant differences in overall mean life span or in 10th-decile life span among the three restricted groups. Telemetered body temperature data confirmed marked differences in the effects of these different restricted feeding schedules on circadian rhythms. The effect of food restriction on survival is probably not due to altered relations among circadian rhythmic variables. Possible contributing factors suggested by the results are a lower body temperature, a reduced overall metabolic rate and an increased circadian amplitude.\r"

The changes in the plasma and hepatic concentrations of various classes of lipid and carnitine were inversely related and were found to be progressive up to 0.8% DL-carnitine supplementation.

In the presence of Gypsophylla saponin, carrier-mediated galactose transport was inhibited, although the uptake of the passively transported L-isomer of glucose increased. The uptake of the extracellular space marker, polyethylene glycol 4000, was also higher, indicating that the saponin inhibited active transport by increasing the general permeability of the enterocytes. Gypsophylla saponin, in contact only with the mucosal surface of everted jejunal sacs, induced a rapid decline in glucose-stimulated transmural potential difference. The rate of decline increased as the saponin concentration was raised over the approximate range of 0.3 to 8 mM. Saponaria saponin and alpha-tomatine also reduced transmural potential difference, but soya saponins were much less effective. The results indicate that some saponins readily increase the permeability of the small intestinal mucosal cells, thereby inhibiting active nutrient transport, and facilitating the uptake of materials to which the gut would normally be impermeable.\r"

Although pulmonary specialists recorded fewer (55% of observations) abnormal findings than did medical students (74%), they were significantly (p = 0.008) less self-consistent than were the students. There was no clear trend in agreement between examiners (kappa = 0.20-0.49). Each examiner's findings were compared with those of physicians specially trained in pulmonary examination. Dichotomous variables (wheezes, crackles, rubs) were more reliably detected (kappa = 0.30-0.70) than graded variables (tympany, dullness, breath sound intensity), where kappa = 0.16-0.43. The authors suggest that dichotomous variables deserve greatest clinical reliance; that time in training, alone, does not improve clinical performance; and that there is a disconcertingly large amount of inter- and intraobserver disagreement in this fundamental clinical task.\r"

Of the 763 (4%) admitted with hyponatremia, 757 (99%) were matched by age, gender, and admitting date with normonatremic control patients. Hyponatremic patients were more than seven times as likely to die in the hospital than the control patients, and they were more than twice as likely to die after discharge (p less than 0.0001 for both). This relationship with in- and outpatient mortality held when controlling for the diagnoses found more often in the hyponatremic patients. Hyponatremia appears to be an indicator of increased risk of death regardless of the disease with which it is associated.\r"

It has been suggested that dyspnea is an example of a condition the causes of which cannot be easily distinguished based on identification in the history of stereotypical disease patterns presented in standard texts. To evaluate this assertion, faculty members independently interviewed 146 consecutively admitted patients with dyspnea, and following the history of the present illness, made a diagnosis. After discharge of the patients, another faculty member, using preselected criteria, independently reviewed each record to make a final diagnosis. History-based diagnoses predicted final diagnoses 74% of the time. Therefore, the history appeared to be useful in identifying the primary diagnosis for most dyspneic patients admitted to the hospital. However, it is not known whether this identification provides sufficient rationale for therapy or leads to more efficient use of laboratory tests.\r"

Sixty-eight residents were evaluated by 424 patients over a six-month period. Continuing residents with the lowest scores were assigned to a feedback or a non-feedback group. Residents in the feedback group were individually shown their mean scores on each item, as well as scores for all residents, and were then advised of physicians' behaviors that could increase patient satisfaction. During a subsequent six-month survey of new patients, scores in the feedback group improved more than those in the non-feedback group in art of care, technical quality, and total patient satisfaction (p less than 0.001).\r"

We offer some practical suggestions: Well-trained audiologists can help with both hearing aids and rehabilitation; groups for the hard of hearing can be supportive. The number and varieties of helpful devices increase steadily. Medical personnel, families, and the general public need to learn more about communicating with these people, who need help, often desperately.\r"

A randomized trial sufficiently large (power 80%) to detect a reduction in the incidence of umbilical artery (UA) catheter complications, including aortic thrombus formation, from 45% to 20% was conducted in 125 infants. The infants were monitored for complications possibly related to the use of a UA catheter, such as systemic hypertension and abnormalities of lower extremity perfusion. The presence of aortic thrombi was assessed by ultrasound study 3.5 +/- 1.2 (SD) days and 11.1 +/- 2.3 days after insertion of the catheter. The use of HB-PU umbilical catheters did not lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of complications and aortic thrombi compared with the use of PVC catheters. The lack of reduction may have been related to the prolonged duration of catheter use in both groups. A much larger study would have been required to detect a smaller, but perhaps clinically significant, reduction in catheter-associated complications.\r"

An essentially similar pattern of prenatal biochemical maturation was found in all four species. The developmental changes were characterized by (1) rapid elevations in fetal lung antioxidant enzyme levels during the final 10% to 15% of gestation, and (2) an essentially parallel rapid rise in lung surfactant content during the final 10% to 15% of gestation. The increase in the lung activity of the individual antioxidant enzymes prior to birth averaged approximately 150% to 200%. Our findings suggest that late gestational changes in the principal pulmonary antioxidant defense system (like the changes in the surfactant system) represents a normal \"preparation for birth,\" required to assure successful functioning of the neonatal lung in the relatively oxygen-rich ex utero environment.\r"

The infants were monitored continuously before and for 15 minutes after nebulization of metaproterenol during 3 consecutive days at mean age 34 days. There were significant increases in compliance, tidal volume, and tcPO2, and significant decreases in pulmonary resistance and tcPCO2. These data show that bronchospasm contributes significantly to the high pulmonary resistance in preterm infants with chronic lung disease and that metaproterenol is beneficial in the therapy of infants with chronic lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation.\r"

Six patients with idiopathic GH deficiency received GH 0.08 U/kg three times per week plus Cp 0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg/day for 4-month periods, alternating with 4-month periods of GH plus placebo, on average for 16 months. Overall, height velocity (HV) increased from 9.1 +/- 2.4 with GH alone to 12.1 +/- 2.1 cm/yr with GH-Cp (P = 0.01) and weight velocity (WV) increased substantially from 1.3 +/- 1.3 to 7.8 +/- 3.6 kg/yr (P = 0.01). For 10 of 11 8-month treatment intervals completed, HV was greater during GH-Cp treatment than during GH alone, and there was a good correlation between HV and WV for each 4-month observation period (r = 0.64, P less than 0.002). These findings should be considered preliminary because of the small number of patients, but suggest that weight gain induced by cyproheptadine results in improved linear growth in patients given GH and that this drug may be useful in optimizing the response to GH therapy.\r"

Both dosage schedules resulted in increased growth rate during the first 12 months of therapy; the tiw dosage was more effective in the first 6 months in patients with organic hypopituitarism, and in the second 6 months in patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism. There was no advantage to tiw therapy during the second year of therapy in either group. The additional increment in height after 1 year of therapy using tiw compared with biw therapy was 2 cm and 1 cm for the patients with organic and idiopathic hypopituitarism, respectively. This increment should be weighed against the cost, pain, and inconvenience of tiw versus biw doses of hGH in the treatment of hGH deficiency. With the dosages used in this study, tiw therapy was more effective during the first year, when patients are more responsive, and should be recommended. Twice weekly therapy could be considered for the second and possibly subsequent years of therapy. Other schedules of treatment may be more effective than either of these schedules.\r"

Overall, 59 (33%) of the group were known to seroconvert by age 10 years. This was a minimal figure because of loss to follow-up. Analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method indicated that the probability of remaining seronegative was 65% at age 6 years, and 58% at age 8 years. Variables positively related to seroconversion by multivariate analysis were order of birth, seroconversion in a family member, and breast-feeding. During the first year of life, acquisition of CMV antibody was related to the seroimmune status of the mother. The variables of socioeconomic status, race, age of the mother, and attendance in a day care center did not appear to be related to seroconversion in these children.\r"

  ".W": "A syndrome of periodic fever that resembles human cyclic neutropenia in its clinical presentation has been identified in 12 children observed at two major referral centers. Attacks characterized by abrupt onset of fever, malaise, chills, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, headache, and tender cervical adenopathy occur at 4- to 6-week intervals over periods of years. These episodes of illness resolve spontaneously in 4 to 5 days. Mild leukocytosis and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate during attacks are the only laboratory abnormalities. Affected children grow normally, are not unusually susceptible to infection, and exhibit no long-term sequelae. Attacks may be aborted by short courses of prednisone but do not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. This syndrome is sporadic and appears to be much more common than cyclic neutropenia.\r"

Prospective evaluation of these infants, including seven to age 60 months, revealed that acquisition of normal immunoglobulin levels was often delayed beyond infancy. In some cases the diminished immunoglobulin levels were a prodrome of selective lgA deficiency. These children seemed to experience frequent sinopulmonary infections early in life, but fewer with age. None of these children received exogenous gammaglobulin. The designation of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy is a misnomer, and the diagnosis, even if accepted, can be made only in retrospect. The alternative designation hypogammaglobulinemia of early childhood is suggested, to which can be added \"with recovery\" or \"with development of other dysgammaglobulinemia,\" depending on the eventual phenotype observed.\r"

  ".W": "Eight polymorphic sites for seven restriction endonucleases have been reported at the human phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. The composite profile of the presence or absence for each of the eight polymorphic sites within an allele defines the haplotype of the corresponding allele. Twelve such haplotypes associated with normal and mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles have been identified in 33 Danish families with children with phenylketonuria. Of the 66 mutant alleles analyzed, 59 (89%) were associated with only four haplotypes. The identification of individual phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles by haplotype analysis enables correlation of the hyperphenylalaninemic phenotypes of the patients with their genotypes. Patients who were either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutant alleles of haplotypes 2 and 3 had a severe clinical course. Patients who had a mutant allele of either haplotype 1 or 4 usually had a less severe clinical phenotype. The recent demonstration that the mutation responsible for classic phenylketonuria associated with haplotype 3 is not present in mutant alleles of other haplotypes provides unambiguous evidence that there are multiple mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and supports the hypothesis that different combinations of mutant alleles may be responsible for the clinical diversity of phenylketonuria.\r"

The striking similarity of both the distinctive dysmorphic features and the unique pattern of fractures in two unrelated individuals suggests that this is a previously unrecognized form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Despite the craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus, intellectual performance is unimpaired in both individuals. Bone biopsy in one patient revealed decreased bone volume and increased bone resorption without compensatory new bone formation. Extensive laboratory investigations have not identified a cause, nor have they clarified pathogenesis; further elucidation will require the identification and study of new cases.\r"

All three groups were similar for socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, and ethnicity. Maternal age of group 1 was similar to that of group 3, but group 2 mothers were significantly older. Gravidity was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3. No statistical difference was found in spontaneous abortion rate among the three groups, but the stillbirth rate was significantly higher in group 1 (chi 2 = 6.89, P less than or equal to 0.01). All stillbirths were related to abruptio placentae. Birth weight, length, and head circumference were significantly decreased in infants in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3 (P less than or equal to 0.0001), but no statistical difference was found between groups 1 and 2. The congenital malformation rate was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 3 (chi 2 = 7.07, P less than or equal to 0.01). We conclude that cocaine abuse in humans significantly reduces weight of the fetus, increases the stillbirth rate related to abruptio placentae, and is associated with a higher malformation rate.\r"

All infants had combinations of these defects. Infection was proved by viral isolation in each case; all isolates were HSV-2. Two infants died during the first week of life; 10 of the surviving infants had severe neurologic sequelae, and one infant was blind. Four mothers experienced an apparent primary genital HSV infection, and one had recurrent infection, at varying times during gestation. The remaining women denied a history of symptoms of genital HSV infection. These findings indicate that intrauterine HSV infection can occur as a consequence of either primary or recurrent maternal infection and has severe consequences for the fetus.\r"

These rings were pre-exposed to phenoxybenzamine to block tissue catecholamine uptake and alpha adrenoceptors. They were then contracted with high potassium, and beta adrenergic agonist dose-relaxation response curves were obtained in the presence and absence of beta antagonists. The orders of agonist potency in the arterial rings were the same as that in spontaneously beating guinea pig atria: isoproterenol (ISO) greater than norepinephrine (NE) greater than fenoterol (FE) greater than salbutamol (SA) and differed from that in the guinea pig trachea: ISO greater than FE greater than SA greater than NE. Schild analysis yielded propranolol pA2 values in the coronary artery rings which did not differ between the four agonists studied or between the proximal and distal ends of the coronary artery. Similar results were obtained with practolol and butoxamine with the exception that in the case of butoxamine, a higher pA2 value was obtained against ISO in the distal ring preparations. The practolol and butoxamine pA2 values in the artery rings matched the respective--log KB values obtained in the guinea pig atria using NE as the agonist but were the reverse of those obtained in the guinea pig trachea using either FE or SA as the agonist. It is concluded that the proximal and distal ends of the bovine anterior descending coronary artery possess a homogeneous population of beta-1 adrenergic receptors.\r"

After beta adrenoceptor blockade, left cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation produced frequency dependent decreases in LCX blood flow. Selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade with idazoxan produced a greater inhibition of this decrease in LCX blood flow than did selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin. In an additional population of dogs which were similarly prepared but were not spinally transectioned or pretreated with a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, left cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation produced an increase in LCX blood flow in all animals which reached a maximum within 40 sec, and then began to decline slowly. However, after beta adrenoceptor blockade, identical stimulation parameters produced only a decline in LCX blood flow which returned to the level of control resting blood flow by the end of the stimulation period. Both selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade with idazoxan and selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin produced an inhibition of the LCX blood flow decrease provoked by left cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation in dogs pretreated with beta adrenoceptor antagonists. Idazoxan produced a slightly greater inhibition of the LCX blood flow decrease than did prazosin, suggesting a greater role for postjunctional vascular alpha-2 adrenoceptors in LCX blood flow regulation during cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation. The presence of a severe coronary artery stenosis reduced, but did not inhibit, the increase in LCX blood flow in response to cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the dog, NE (0.1 microgram/kg i.v.), PE (1 microgram/kg i.v.), M (20 micrograms/kg i.v.) and B-HT 920 (1 microgram/kg i.v.) produced similar increases in mean arterial pressure (NE, 52 +/- 4 mmHg; PE, 42 +/- 4 mm Hg; M, 43 +/- 7 mm Hg; B-HT 920, 45 +/- 6 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (NE, 20.8 +/- 5.8 mm Hg/l/min; PE, 23.1 +/- 4.2 mm Hg/l/min; M, 18.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg/l/min; B-HT 920, 24.8 +/- 7.1 mm Hg/l/min).

  ".W": "The ability of the atypical agonists celiprolol and pindolol to induce sequestration and down regulation of beta adrenergic receptors was investigated in S49 lymphoma cells. Sequestration was measured as the loss of binding sites for [3H]CGP-12177, a hydrophilic radioligand that binds only to surface beta adrenergic receptors at 6 degrees C. Down regulation was measured as the loss of binding sites for [125I]iodopindolol, a lipophilic radioligand which at 37 degrees C binds to both surface and sequestered receptors. Pindolol and celiprolol do not stimulate adenylate cyclase in membranes from wild-type (WT) S49 cells or do they induce the sequestration of beta adrenergic receptors on intact cells. Incubation of WT S49 lymphoma cells with isoproterenol for 24 hr resulted in the loss of 75% of total cellular beta adrenergic receptors (down regulation). Exposure of WT S49 cells to pindolol or celiprolol for 24 hr resulted in the loss of approximately half of the total cellular beta adrenergic receptors. In mutant S49 cells [cyc- (variant of S49 lymphoma cells which lacks Ns activity) and UNC (variant of S49 lymphoma cells in which Ns is present but cannot interact with beta adrenergic receptors)] in which interaction of beta adrenergic receptors with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Ns) does not occur, a 24 hr incubation with isoproterenol caused the loss of approximately half of the beta adrenergic receptors, whereas pindolol and celiprolol caused no change in the number of receptors. These results suggest that there are two mechanisms of down regulation of beta adrenergic receptors in S49 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dextromethorphan (DM) was tested for its effect on the contractility of the guinea pig ileum in vitro. Comparisons were made with levomethorphan, levorphanol, codeine and loperamide. DM and codeine inhibited the contractions of the electrically stimulated ileum, with IC50 values of 15 and 8 microM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of DM, in contrast to codeine, was not blocked by the opiate antagonist naloxone. Pretreatment (8, 50 and 100 microM) with DM and its I-isomer levomethorphan reduced in a dose-dependent fashion both phasic and tonic contractions produced by maximally effective concentrations of carbachol and 80 mM KCl. Pretreatment (8, 50 and 100 microM) with codeine, dextrorphan or levorphanol, unlike DM, did not reduce carbachol or KCl-induced contractions. The concentration-response curves to calcium in K+ depolarized ileum were shifted to the right in a parallel manner suggesting competitive antagonism for DM (pA2 5.3), levomethorphan (pA2 5.3) and loperamide (pA2 6.6). Codeine and levorphanol (8, 50 and 100 microM) did not antagonize calcium-induced contractions. In two assays of calmodulin-dependent processes DM was inactive (IC50 greater than 1 mM), whereas trifluoperazine and calmidazolium (standard calmodulin antagonists) were active in the micromolar range. In summary, these data suggest that DM, through a nonopiate mechanism, antagonizes gut contractility possibly by \"stabilizing\" neuronal and/or muscle cell membranes.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that the carrier-mediated system capable of transporting small, N-tyrosinated peptides [e.g., Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (N-Tyr-MIF-1) and enkephalins] across the blood-brain barrier is modulated by intraventricularly administered leucine. This raises the possibility that the toxicity of amino acids on the central nervous system may be mediated in part by alterations in blood-brain barrier function. We further examined this action of leucine and extended the investigation to include other essential amino acids. High doses of leucine (30 nM and 100 nM/mouse intraventricularly) were found to inhibit significantly transport of iodinated Tyr-MIF-1 out of the brain. Less consistently, a low dose of leucine (1.0 nM/mouse) stimulated transport. Kinetic analysis indicated that leucine produced an uncompetitive type of modulation, probably interacting with the carrier-ligand complex. Among the other amino acids studied, D-leucine inhibited transport at both 1 nM and 100 nM/mouse, but stimulated transport at 0.1 nM/mouse. The only other significant changes occurred at the high (100 nM) dose of arginine, which stimulated, and methionine, which inhibited, transport. The possibility is proposed that derangements in amino acid metabolism might produce some of their effects on the central nervous system by modulating the blood-brain barrier transport systems for peptides and possibly other substances.\r"

Plasma disappearance of [3H]TCDD-labeled chylomicrons followed first-order decay kinetics, with two exponential components having half-lives of 0.8 and 30 min, respectively. Liver and adipose tissues together accounted for 74 to 81% of the total radioactivity distributed among various tissues. The i.p. route of administration was as effective as the oral route for uptake in 24 h by the adipose and liver tissues, whereas the s.c. route was less efficient. Adipose tissue exhibited a progressive accumulation of labeled TCDD during the first 24 h, whereas the liver showed an exponential disappearance of the newly absorbed TCDD with a half-life of 21.3 h. In contrast, long-term pharmacokinetics of TCDD in the adipose and liver tissues revealed exponential decay patterns with half-lives of 7.6 and 5.3 weeks, respectively. These results show that the adipose tissue and the liver are the major sites of TCDD storage.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors were examined in rat caudal artery using radioligand binding of [125I]labeled BE 2254 (125IBE) and in vitro contraction measurements. 125IBE bound rapidly and reversibly to a single class of high affinity binding sites in membrane preparations of caudal artery. Scatchard analysis gave an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 110 pM and a density of binding sites of 115 fmol/mg of protein. Antagonists inhibited 125IBE binding and phenylephrine-induced contractions competitively, with an order of potency of prazosin greater than ARC 239 greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine. pA2 values for inhibition of phenylephrine-induced contraction correlated well with KD values for inhibition of specific 125IBE binding. A number of other full and partial agonists also caused contraction of caudal arteries with an order of potency of epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. The order of potency of agonists and the potencies of antagonists suggests that the contractile responses of rat caudal artery were mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. The EC50 values of partial agonists in causing contraction correlated well with their KD values for inhibition of specific 125IBE binding. However, the EC50 values for full agonists were 30 to 200 times lower than their KD values. Treatment of caudal arteries in vitro with 0.1 microM phenoxybenzamine for 10 min to inactivate alpha adrenergic receptors decreased both the potency of full agonists in causing contraction and the maximal contractile response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With the use of cultured murine neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115), the authors studied the effects of chronic ethanol on prostaglandin E, (PGE1)-mediated cyclic AMP formation, adenylate cyclase activity and [3H]PGE1 binding. Whereas acute exposure of these cells to ethanol potentiates the PGE1 response, exposure of cells, for as little as 1 day, to 100 mM ethanol resulted in a diminished responsiveness to PGE1 compared with that in acutely treated cells. This apparent tolerance was well developed by day 4, and, by day 7, treated cells had a diminished response to PGE1 when assayed in the absence of ethanol. To achieve the same level of PGE1-mediated cyclic AMP synthesis as acutely exposed cells, chronically exposed cells required higher concentrations of ethanol. With 7 to 10 days of treatment, there was a modest (10-13%) increase in basal, PGE1- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranous preparations, a 28 to 40% increase in high-affinity [3H]PGE1 binding to membranes with no change in Kd or in the ability of 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate to reduce this binding and a 155% increase in [3H]PGE1 binding to intact cells with no change in Kd. Thus, chronic exposure of N1E-115 cells to ethanol resulted in tolerance to its effects on the PGE1 receptor system, and this tolerance was accompanied by apparently paradoxical changes in PGE1-stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis and [3H]PGE1 binding.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulus properties of caffeine were studied in separate groups of rats trained to discriminate between i.p. injections of saline and either 10 or 30 mg/kg of caffeine in a discrete-trial avoidance paradigm. Stimulus control of behavior (i.e., reliable completion of at least 18 of 20 trials on the appropriate choice lever after injection of saline or caffeine) was established in an average of 50 to 52 sessions. Novel drugs were tested over a range of doses for generalization to one (10 mg/kg) or both doses of caffeine. The methylxanthine derivatives, theophylline, theobromine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, 8-phenyltheophylline and 8-chlorotheophylline, were generalized to caffeine partially or not at all. Of the nonxanthine drugs, apomorphine, clonidine and picrotoxin occasioned responding only on the saline-appropriate choice lever, d-amphetamine and ephedrine generalized partially, and cocaine and methylphenidate generalized with caffeine completely, as did 2-(2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenylimino)imidazolidine an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. The discriminative effects of 10 mg/kg of caffeine were blocked dose-dependently and completely by alpha adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (phentolamine, prazosin and yohimbine) and were blocked partially by propranolol and by drugs having behavioral depressant properties (diazepam, pentobarbital and the adenosine analogs, R-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, cyclohexyladenosine, 2-chloroadenosine). The blockade by phentolamine could be surmounted by increasing the dose of caffeine, the partial blockade by diazepam and 2-chloroadenosine could not. Alpha adrenergic receptor blocking drugs also antagonized the caffeine-like discriminative effects of methylphenidate and 2-(2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenylimino)imidazolidine. The discriminative stimulus effects of caffeine in the rat appear to be mediated in part by alpha adrenergic mechanisms.\r"

We have examined the effects of the adenosine analog phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) on lipolysis in vivo in intact rats. PIA suppresses markedly serum-free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations when injected s.c. (-)-PIA is more potent than (+)-PIA in suppressing FFA concentrations; also, this effect of (-)-PIA is blocked by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline. (-)-PIA also suppressed plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations by approximately 50% in these rats. Utilizing Triton WR1339 injections, we found that the decrease in serum TG concentrations was associated with a marked fall in very low density lipoprotein secretion rate. We also examined the effects of (-)-PIA on FFA and TG concentrations in two models of hypertriglyceridemia in rats: stretozotocin-induced diabetes and sucrose feeding. Both groups had elevated FFA and TG concentrations compared with controls. An injection of (-)-PIA suppressed markedly FFA concentrations and essentially normalized the serum concentration of TG in these rats. We conclude that (-)-PIA suppresses markedly lipolysis and triglyceride secretion in control and hypertriglyceridemic rats suggesting that the activation of adenosine receptors may have major metabolic effects in vivo.\r"

The cumulative administration of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg i.v. decreased mean arterial pressure by 18 to 26 mm Hg from a pretreatment value of 106 +/- 6 mm Hg and slightly enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction. After 3.0 mg/kg of SCH 19927, sinoatrial (SA) conduction times were decreased, whereas intraventricular conduction was depressed slightly. SCH 19927, 10.0 mg/kg, reduced mean arterial pressure by 39 mm Hg and enhanced SA nodal conduction and recovery after overdrive pacing (decreased SA conduction time and corrected sinus node recovery times), whereas intraventricular conduction times and the rate-corrected QTc interval were prolonged. Sinus heart rate, atrial, ventricular and atrioventricular nodal functional and effective refractory periods were unaltered by SCH 19927, 0.3 to 10.0 mg/kg. The administration of SCH 19927 produced significant beta adrenergic receptor blockade, as determined by inhibition of the positive chronotropic and peripheral vasodilatory response to isoproterenol, but did not alter the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated vasopressor response to phenylephrine. The results indicate that SCH 19927, in beta adrenergic receptor blocking and hypotensive dosages, does not depress SA nodal or atrioventricular nodal function, thus suggesting an electrophysiologic spectrum of activity different from that of other beta adrenergic receptor antagonists.\r"

The in vivo brain extraction and salivary gland extraction of [3H] bupivacaine relative to [14C]butanol were determined with an intracarotid injection technique used on rats. The brain extraction varied inversely with the bovine serum albumin (0-7.5%) and AAG (0-3.0 mg/ml) concentrations. The salivary extraction only slightly varied inversely with the AAG concentration, whereas no significant effects of bovine albumin binding on salivary gland uptake were observed. The in vivo percentage of exchangeable drug in brain or salivary gland capillaries was severalfold greater than the in vitro percentage of unbound drug. The percent values of free drug, brain exchangeable drug and salivary exchangeable drug were 12 +/- 1, 81 +/- 7 and 93 +/- 18% for umbilical cord serum, 8.6 +/- 1.1, 73 +/- 6 and 103 +/- 3% for normal human serum, 5.9 +/- 0.5, 60 +/- 4 and 89 +/- 3% for serum of rheumatoid arthritis patients and 5.0 +/- 0.2, 45 +/- 2 and 83 +/- 3% for serum of metastatic cancer patients. These data indicate that bupivacaine is not transported through the brain capillary wall, i.e., the blood-brain barrier, from the bovine albumin-bound pool, but bupivacaine is partially available for transfer from the circulating AAG-bound pool. However, both bovine albumin-bound and AAG-bound bupivacaine are readily available for transport through salivary gland capillaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These responses are diminished profoundly when a second injection of HA is given within a short time after the first injection.

Blood pressure and heart rate were measured directly from indwelling carotid catheters, and drugs were administered in three consecutive intraventricular injections to conscious freely moving rats at 30-min intervals. HA, the H2 agonist, impromidine and the combined injection of pyridylethylamine and impromidine induced tachyphylaxis of the pressor response. The H1 agonist, pyridylethylamine and the HA-N-methyltransferase inhibitor, SKF-91488 (homodimaprit) did not show tachyphylaxis. Heart rate responses were more complex and only HA demonstrated tachyphylaxis of the bradycardia. It is concluded that the tachyphylaxis of the pressor response caused by repeated injections of HA results from the desensitization of central HA H2 receptors.\r"

AVP elicited a potent and concentration-dependent contraction in human mesenteric arterial rings with an EC50 value of 2.01 X 10(-9) M. The presence or absence of the vascular endothelium did not affect significantly AVP-induced contraction. AVP induced slight, although significant, tachyphylaxis in human mesenteric arteries. The selective vascular (V1) receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5 1Tyr(Me)2]AVP (SK&F 100273) shifted the concentration-response curves for AVP-induced vascular contraction to the right in a parallel manner (KB = 2.23 X 10(-9) M). A mixed V1/V2 receptor antagonist, [d(CH2)5 1D-Tyr(Et)2Val4desGly9]AVP (SK&F 101926), was also a potent antagonist of AVP-mediated vascular contraction; however, inhibition was marked by a nonparallel shift of the concentration-response curves with depression of maximum contraction. Furthermore, a relatively renal (V2) selective receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5 1D-Ile2Val4]AVP (SK&F 101485) was approximately 100-fold less potent at inhibiting AVP-induced vascular contraction (KB = 1.37 X 10(-7) M). These studies illustrate for the first time the in vitro effects of selective vasopressin receptor antagonists in isolated human blood vessels. Studies of other blood vessels and the design of therapeutically useful antagonists should proceed with the hypothesis that the vasopressin receptors mediating vascular contraction in human mesenteric arteries are of the V1 subtype.\r"

Electrical stimulation (5-80 Hz) produced a significant increase in the rate of release of met-enkephalin the magnitude of which was not dependent on the frequency of stimulation. Analysis of the release of met-enkephalin per pulse as a function of the frequency of stimulation indicated that the release of this opioid peptide from the myenteric plexus is inversely proportional to the frequency of stimulation. Electrically evoked release (40 Hz) of met-enkephalin was reduced by greater than 80% by substituting CoCl2 for CaCl2 or by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin (1 microgram/ml for 15 min). Evoked release was also reduced substantially by pretreatment with morphine (1 microM, 1.5 min). Alternatively, pretreatment of naive longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus strips with the opiate antagonist (-)-naloxone caused a significant increase in the rate of met-enkephalin release in the absence of electrical stimulation. In contrast, (+)-naloxone was devoid of any activity. These data, in combination with indirect pharmacological experiments, strongly indicate that met-enkephalin functions as a neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system. Moreover, the activity of neurons that transmit via met-enkephalin appears to be under opioid regulation.\r"

In filtering isolated kidneys perfused with 0.1 mM adenosine, 1 mM papaverine inhibited adenosine removal from the perfusate by 40% and elevated the fractional excretion of adenosine from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.0. Theophylline (10 mM) inhibited 0.1 mM adenosine removal in the filtering kidney by 18% and decreased the fractional excretion of adenosine to 0.2 +/- 0.1. In nonfiltering isolated kidneys perfused with 0.1 mM adenosine, 1 mM papaverine or 10 mM theophylline inhibited the rate of adenosine removal from the perfusate by 41 or 19%, respectively. Papaverine (50 or 100 microM) was a potent cis inhibitor of the initial (15 sec) rate of 1 microM [3H]adenosine influx into L and AL membrane vesicles. The influx of 1 microM [3H]adenosine was inhibited partially by 50 microM and inhibited completely by 100 microM papaverine. Papaverine at 10 microM trans stimulated the efflux of 50 microM [3H]adenosine preloaded into AL vesicles. However, theophylline (up to 100 microM) had no effect on the influx of 1 microM [3H]adenosine into L and AL vesicles. The data suggest that papaverine is a potent, direct inhibitor of adenosine transport across both L and AL membranes whereas it is likely that theophylline increases net adenosine influx across the L membrane and decreases adenosine influx across the AL membrane by indirect metabolic effects.\r"

The number of binding sites per AAG increased to 0.99 +/- 0.06 when the concentration of AAG was determined immunologically. On the other hand, delipidized AAG had a Kd of 28.0 microM, with an N of 1.72 based on the immunological assay. Various preparations of HSA had Kd/N values ranging from 4.3 to 17.3 mM. The number of binding sites per HSA molecule could not be determined because the maximum concentration of lidocaine that can be used is 10 mM, which is only approximately equal to the Kd. The Kd to HSA was so low and the capacity so high that, at therapeutic concentrations, the binding was in the linear range. Solutions containing both purified AAG and HSA had Kd values of 30.2 +/- 1.8 microM, with 2.01 +/- 0.04 binding sites per AAG molecule. With HSA and delipidized AAG, the Kd was 60 microM, with 3.16 sites per delipidized AAG molecule.

  ".W": "In canine cutaneous veins, cooling augments the contractile responses evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation despite a cooling-induced reduction in the release of norepinephrine. With exogenous norepinephrine, the increased responsiveness observed during cooling results from enhanced sensitivity of the postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The present experiments were performed to analyze the mechanism of the increased neurogenic response during cooling. Rings of canine saphenous vein were suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2. Cooling (from 37-24 degrees C) increased the contractile response evoked by nerve stimulation under control conditions, after alpha-1 adrenergic blockade with prazosin, alpha-2 adrenergic blockade with rauwolscine or the combination of both antagonists. The influence of cooling to enhance the neurogenic response was inhibited only by combined alpha adrenergic and purinergic-receptor blockade (alpha,beta-methylene ATP). Electrical stimulation failed to evoke a contractile response (either at 37 or 24 degrees C) in the presence of tetrodotoxin or after acute sympathetic denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP abolished the contractile response evoked by ATP but did not affect the concentration-effect curves to alpha-1 (phenylephrine) or alpha-2 (UK 14,304) adrenergic stimulation. Cooling augmented the contractile responses evoked by ATP. The results suggest that ATP released from sympathetic neurons in the vessel wall contributes to the cooling-induced augmentation of contractile responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in canine cutaneous veins. This may explain the increased prominence of purinergic mechanisms in cutaneous blood vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine in reducing potassium-induced enhancement of vascular responses to norepinephrine was studied in rabbit aorta and porcine coronary arteries. At multiple levels of external potassium concentration (4-28 mM), norepinephrine concentration-response curves were performed. Whereas the tissue was only slightly depolarized (about 5 mV) by an increase in external potassium to 20 mM, the norepinephrine response was markedly potentiated. For example, the EC50 of norepinephrine in aortic rings was reduced from 4.7 X 10(-8) M in 4 mM potassium to 4.7 X 10(-9) M in 20 mM potassium. Calcium channel blockers reduced potassium- and calcium-induced contractions, the IC50 being 6 X 10(-8) M for verapamil, 5 X 10(-7) M for diltiazem and 3 X 10(-9) M for nifedipine. These concentrations only minimally reduced norepinephrine contraction in 4 mM potassium but virtually abolished the depolarization-induced potentiation of the norepinephrine contraction. Even short exposures to levels of potassium, which resulted in little or no contraction by themselves, markedly potentiated the norepinephrine contraction. Therefore, the abolition of this potentiation by calcium channel blockers cannot be explained by a reduction of potassium-induced contraction. Similar observations were made in porcine coronary arteries. Thus, the potency of calcium channel blockers against norepinephrine-induced contractions is markedly increased in depolarized vascular smooth muscle. Calcium channel blockers may be especially effective in preventing enhanced vascular contractions resulting from physiological concentrations of catecholamines in partially depolarized vascular smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "87086340\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that opioid peptides, acting at mu-receptors in the brain, stimulate central sympathetic outflow thereby increasing plasma catecholamine concentrations in unstressed rats. Brain sites involved in opioid-mediated catecholamine secretion have not been characterized fully. Additionally, brain opioid effects on sympathoadrenal catecholamine secretion during stress have not been defined. Because the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) plays a central role in autonomic and cardiovascular regulation, we administered the mu-selective enkephalin analog, D-Ala2-NMe-Phe4-Gly(ol)5enkephalin (DAGO), directly into PVN in conscious, unstressed rats and determined the changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations, blood pressure and heart rate. Then, during the peak response, rats were subjected to restraint stress and the same parameters were again measured. Under basal conditions, picomolar doses of DAGO injected into PVN increased plasma concentrations of catecholamines, especially epinephrine, and raised blood pressure. These effects were dose-related (0.01-0.3 nmol) and antagonized by naloxone given either systemically or directly into PVN. Tachycardia was also observed except at the highest dose of DAGO (0.3 nmol). Thus, mu-receptor stimulation in PVN increases central sympathetic outflow in nonstressful situations, producing increased adreno-medullary catecholamine secretion, blood pressure and heart rate. During restraint stress, PVN microinjections of DAGO blunted stress-induced tachycardia, apparently by a vagal mechanism as this effect was blocked by atropine methyl nitrate. PVN DAGO had no significant effect on the plasma catecholamine responses to restraint stress. In contrast, naloxone injected into PVN augmented stress-induced epinephrine secretion. Thus, PVN mu-receptors may regulate heart rate during stress, and an endogenous opioid released during restraint stress may modulate adrenomedullary responses to stress.\r"

Chem. 260: 15639-15645, 1985), potently inhibits several PAF-induced in vivo responses in rats. Intravenously and p.o. administered L-652,731 gave a dose-response inhibition of PAF-induced lysosomal hydrolase secretion and extravasation with ED50 values of 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. Inhibitions of 87% were achieved with 50 mg/kg p.o. After a single 5-mg/kg p.o. dose, L-652,731 achieved 50 to 60% inhibition of PAF-induced lysosomal hydrolase secretion and extravasation by 0.5 to 1.5 hr with near maximum inhibition lasting through 6 hr. A 20-mg/kg p.o. dose of L-652,731 inhibited PAF-induced leukopenia and neutropenia by 96 and 73%, respectively. The most substantial inhibitions of the extravasation and lysosomal hydrolase secretion induced by PAF or soluble immune complexes were achieved by p.o. L-652,731 (20 mg/kg) with moderate inhibition by dexamethasone and little or no inhibition by antagonists/inhibitors of histamine H1 or H2 or serotonin receptors or cyclooxygenase. Intravenous infusion of a 0.4 mg of L-652,731 bolus inhibited the hypotensive responses from subsequent PAF infusions by a maximum of 72% and with a half-life duration of action of 2.5 hr. Intravenous infusion of L-652,731 results in an immediate 87% reversal of the extreme hypotension induced by a previous endotoxin injection. Thus, with its good p.o. activity, long duration of action and specificity in inhibiting PAF-induced responses in vivo, L-652,731 is a very useful tool in determining the role of PAF in mediating different pathophysiological processes.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of a low-affinity site activated by norepinephrine (NE), which is demonstrable in arterial smooth muscle pretreated with phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) to alkylate most alpha adrenoceptors were studied. Treatment with PBZ resulted in biphasic dose-response curves to NE. The initial phase associated with concentrations of NE up to 10(-5) M was due to its action in tissues where alpha adrenoceptors have been reduced to a number that would not support a maximum contraction. The second phase occurred with higher doses of NE. We postulate that this latter PBZ-resistant phase or contraction, which can represent more than 60% of the control maximal response, occurs at low-affinity sites for NE \"extraceptors\" distinct from alpha adrenoceptors in arterial smooth muscle. These residual responses to NE after PBZ treatment were inhibited selectively by prazosin and protected by prazosin from further inhibition by additional doses of PBZ. Effects due to prazosin at low-affinity sites were observed only with doses in excess of those required to competitively inhibit responses through alpha adrenoceptors in smooth muscle. The response to NE occurring through PBZ-resistant adrenoceptors was not dependent on the presence of the endothelium. This low-affinity site for NE was also evident after alkylation of alpha adrenoceptors with other irreversibly acting antagonists (e.g., benextramine and dibenamine). These observations are discussed in relation to the suggestion for a new adrenoceptor, the gamma-adrenoceptor. Differences and similarities of the extraceptor with this proposed adrenoceptor are discussed. Both sites have a high threshold to NE, and both may be influenced by prazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nicotine was administered by i.v. infusion through cannulas implanted in the right jugular veins of mice from the C3H and DBA mouse strains and their derived F1, F2 and backcross (F1 X C3H and F1 X DBA) generations. Nicotine-induced seizure sensitivity was assessed by infusing nicotine at a 2.0 mg/kg/min concentration until the onset of a clonic seizure. After seizure testing, mice were sacrificed and the binding of alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) was determined in three brain regions: cortex, midbrain and hippocampus. The pattern of results for the six generations for seizure sensitivity was similar to that observed for hippocampal BTX binding. Genetic analyses indicate that receptor concentrations in the hippocampus and seizure sensitivity are both influenced by a relatively simple genetic system which involves one or more genes acting in an additive fashion. In addition, the genetic correlation which is indicative of the extent to which two characters are influenced by the same genes, supports the relationship between nicotine-induced seizure sensitivity and hippocampal BTX binding. The results suggest that those animals which are sensitive to nicotine-induced seizures have a greater concentration of nicotinic receptors as determined by the binding of BTX than animals which are less sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine.\r"

  ".W": "Ouabain induced rapid and profound modifications of Na+ and K+ contents in mouse macrophages and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. In mouse macrophages, we found a one-to-one net Na+ gain and K+ depletion, with a maximal initial rate of 30 to 35 mmol (l X cells X hr)-1 and with an IC50 of about 100 microM. The one-to-one exchange results from at least two additive effects: inhibition of the Na+,K+-pump and stimulation of a furosemide-sensitive, outward Na+,K+-cotransport by the increase in internal Na+ content. The latter effect helps the cell to maintain a normal cell volume in spite of the large changes in internal cation content. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta, ouabain provoked net Na+ gain and stimulated a quinidine-sensitive, K+-efflux. This likely reflects the opening of Ca+-dependent, K+-channels in response to an increase in cytosolic-free Ca+ content. Canrenone, an antihypertensive drug, has been shown to behave like a partial agonist at the digitalisreceptor site of the Na+,K+-pump. We observed here in mouse macrophages and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells that: canrenone alone (or at low ouabain concentrations) induces slight Na+ gain and K+ depletion; canrenone partially counterbalances the very rapid cell Na+ gain (and K+ depletion) provoked by high ouabain concentrations, and canrenone reverses the secondary effects of ouabain on the Na+,K+-cotransport system and Ca+-dependent, K+-channels. It appears therefore that canrenone may partially reverse the disturbances of cation handling induced by high concentrations of ouabain in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Liver microsomes were isolated by calcium aggregation, and isolated hepatocytes from male Wistar rats were prepared according to a two-step Ca++-free collagenase perfusion method. With the hepatocytes maximal inhibition of glucuronidation (about 40%) was reached at 10 mM ethanol after incubation at 37 degrees C for 60 min. UDP-glucuronic acid concentration and energy charge in the hepatocytes also did decrease maximally (about 90 and 50%, respectively) and the amount of UDP-glucose was tripled in the presence of 10 mM and higher concentrations of ethanol. The alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole abolished ethanol-induced inhibition of morphine glucuronidation in the hepatocytes. Acetaldehyde (250-50 microM) and the pH decrease induced by ethanol did not reduce morphine-3-glucuronide formation by the cells. Cellular uptake of morphine and excretion of morphine metabolites were similar in the absence and presence of ethanol. Ethanol (60 mM) did not affect the glucuronidation of morphine (1.7 mM added) during a 30-min incubation at 37 degrees C with the microsomes (UDP-glucuronic acid, 5 mM). When the concentration of UDP-glucuronic acid in the microsomes was lowered from 1 to 0.1 mM, the decrease in morphine-3-glucuronide formation was similar to that observed in cells. The data indicate that the inhibition by ethanol of morphine glucuronidation was due to decreased levels of UDP-glucuronic acid. The mechanism is likely to be inhibition of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity by ethanol from increased intracellular NADH/NAD ratio accompanying ethanol oxidation.\r"

Female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to caffeine in their drinking water 7 days/week before, during and after pregnancy. The low exposure (0.15 mg/ml) corresponded to a level sometimes consumed by pregnant women (10-15 mg/kg/day) whereas the high exposure (0.35 mg/ml) was above average human consumption (25-30 mg/kg/day). Blood samples and 24-hr urine samples were collected every 2 weeks throughout dosing. Caffeine and metabolite concentrations in serum and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Before pregnancy, geometric mean serum caffeine concentrations were approximately 1.6 and 4.9 micrograms/ml and serum theophylline concentrations were 6.6 and 13.3 micrograms/ml for the low and high dose groups, respectively. During pregnancy, serum caffeine concentrations increased by approximately 100% for both dose groups and, after parturition, declined to prepregnancy concentrations. Serum theophylline concentrations were usually greater than serum caffeine concentrations and did not change during pregnancy. The amount of caffeine and theophylline excreted in the urine over 24 hr increased during pregnancy and returned to prepregnancy levels after parturition. The results of this study indicate that pregnancy decreased caffeine elimination, resulting in a significant increase in serum caffeine levels. The changes in caffeine elimination may be related to alterations in serum estrogen and progesterone levels.\r"

  ".W": "In order to find a model substrate for kinetic characterization of glutathione conjugation in vivo alpha-bromoisovalerylurea (BIU) was studied. After administration of racemic [14C]urea BIU to rats, two radioactive metabolites were found in bile by high-performance liquid chromatography. The identity of these metabolites was established by various methods. Based on the hydrolytic activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (presence of the gamma-glutamyl moiety), high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (isovaleryl and glutathionyl moieties) and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (molecular weight and fragmentation pattern), they were identified as glutathione conjugates of BIU. Because both conjugates in bile had these characteristics in common they must be diastereomers. Incubation of BIU with glutathione in the presence of rat liver cytosol resulted in formation of the same diastereomeric glutathione conjugates. Chemical synthesis of the diastereomers confirmed their identity. The major urinary excretion products of [14C]urea BIU in the rat were identified as diastereomeric mercapturates. A convenient chromatographic separation of the diastereomeric glutathione conjugates and the mercapturic acids is described. Electrochemical detection was used to determine the presence of the thioethers in both urine and bile. Pharmacokinetic results on BIU conjugation are described in the accompanying paper.\r"

  ".W": "The hypnotic drug alpha-bromoisovalerylurea (BIU) has been studied in the rat with respect to its potential use as model substrate to investigate the pharmacokinetics of glutathione conjugation in vivo. The major metabolites of racemic BIU are the diastereomeric glutathione conjugates (bile) and mercapturates (urine). BIU was metabolized mainly by glutathione conjugation: after i.v. administration of [14C]BIU to freely moving rats, 89% of the dose was recovered in urine within 24 hr, mostly as mercapturates. The rate-limiting step in the clearance of BIU from blood most likely is glutathione conjugation as it was shown that rate-limitation is not due to flow-limited clearance in the liver (the initial extraction ratio of BIU in the perfused liver preparation was low: hepatic extraction ratio = 0.23), protein binding (60% was unbound in plasma) or enzyme saturation (linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range studied: 22-270 mumol/kg). Water solubility of BIU was sufficient to allow its i.v. administration, whereas the absence of toxic effects enables animal as well as human studies. Thus, BIU is a promising model substrate for studies of glutathione conjugation in vivo. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats with a bile duct catheter, equal amounts of metabolites were excreted in bile (almost exclusively as the two diastereomeric BIU glutathione conjugates) and urine (mostly as the two diastereomeric mercapturates). Based on similar experiments with bile duct-ligated rats, it was concluded that the appearance of the mercapturates in urine could also occur without biliary excretion and subsequent gut metabolism of the BIU glutathione conjugates. The ability of the liver to metabolize BIU was studied in a hemoglobin-free, recirculating liver perfusion system. Of the recovered radioactivity 40% was excreted in bile within 2 hr, almost exclusively in the form of the two BIU glutathione conjugates. Also, glutathione conjugates were found in the perfusate (16% of the radioactivity present in the perfusate after 2 hr). A distinct stereoselectivity was observed in the metabolite excretion rates. The excretion half-lives of the two diastereomeric glutathione conjugates in bile differed 2- to 3-fold, both in anesthetized rats and in the perfused liver preparation. A similar difference in excretion half-lives was found for the urinary excretion of the diastereomeric mercapturates. Thus, BIU can be used to investigate in vivo the stereoselectivity of glutathione conjugation.\r"

Infusion of secretin, 16 clinical units X kg-1 X hr-1 caused a persistent increment in LV performance, due to arteriolar dilation as well as a modest inotropic effect. Heart rate was elevated slightly and LV end-diastolic pressure unchanged. Mean arterial pressure was unchanged initially, but decreased slightly at the end of the infusion period. Myocardial oxygen consumption was unaltered. It is concluded that secretin may be well suited for the treatment of acute LV failure.\r"

A threshold concentration parameter (Cth) was incorporated in the pharmacodynamic model. In the present study the influence of the initial endogenous hydrocortisone (HC) level (HCt = O) was investigated, particularly on Cth estimates. Five healthy subjects received a single p.o. dose of 30 mg of prednisolone on two separate occasions. One dose was given at 8:00 A.M. (data set A), the other at 8:00 P.M. (data set B). A second group of five subjects received 30 mg of prednisolone at 8:00 A.M. on 3 consecutive days, measurements being made after the third dose (data set C). Results from a previous experiment in five subjects who received 30 mg of prednisolone at 8:00 A.M. were reanalyzed in the present study (data set D). Blood samples were taken over a period of 12 hr after dosing for determination of corticosteroid levels and OKT4 positive lymphocyte counts. For data sets B and C, HCt = O tended to be lower and OKT4 counts at t = O tended to be higher in comparison with data sets A and D. Pharmacokinetic parameters of prednisolone were similar in the four experiments. The time course of the OKT4 counts after dosing could be fitted irrespective of the initial counts and HCt = O. The results support the postulate that Cth represents prednisolone replacing lost HC and the conclusion that HC and prednisolone are about equipotent with respect to the lymphocytopenic effect. On the basis of our results and literature data, suggestions are made for optimal immunosuppression with prednisolone.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the transport system of cimetidine, an organic cation, in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, the accumulation of cimetidine by the isolated rat choroid plexus was examined. Accumulation of cimetidine was against a concentration gradient via a saturable process (Km = 53 microM, Vmax = 12 nmol/ml/min) that was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents (p-hydroxymercuribenzoate), metabolic inhibitors (KCN and 2,4-dinitrophenol) and hypothermia (Q10 = 4.5), but did not require inward Na+ gradient. Organic cations such as 1N-methylnicotinamide, tetraethylammonium, choline, histamine and creatinine did not affect the accumulation of cimetidine at the concentration of 1 mM. Cimetidine did not affect the accumulation of tetraethylammonium. More lipophilic cations such as quinidine and quinine inhibited not only the accumulation of cimetidine but also that of an organic anion, benzylpenicillin, although the inhibitory mechanisms are not known. One millimolar of organic anions, such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, p-aminohippuric acid, homovanillic acid, salicylic acid and benzylpenicillin, inhibited the accumulation of cimetidine. Furthermore, the accumulation of organic anions (benzylpenicillin and salicylic acid) showed saturability and was inhibited by cimetidine. Cimetidine and the organic anions thus showed a mutual inhibition. Oligopeptides also inhibited the accumulation of cimetidine. These findings suggested that cimetidine transport in the choroid plexus is via carrier-mediated active transport process, but does not require inward Na+ gradient. This transport is inhibited by several compounds with different properties like oligopeptides, lipophilic cations and organic anions, although the inhibitory mechanism is not known.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of low doses of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on auditory-evoked potentials recorded from the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus were assessed during performance of an auditory two-tone discrimination task. Conditioned behavior was disrupted up to 2 hr after i.p. injections of delta 9-THC at 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg: responses to the rewarded stimulus decreased significantly and latency to respond increased significantly. Concurrent recordings indicated that these same doses of THC did not grossly distort the outer molecular layer averaged evoked potential waveform, but did produce opposing alterations in the amplitudes of the previously studied averaged evoked potential components N1 and N2. The amplitude of the N1 component was decreased significantly 0 to 2 hr after THC injection, whereas the amplitude of the N2 component increased significantly. THC injection at 0.5 mg/kg had no significant effects on performance or on N1 or N2 amplitudes. Recovery from the effects of 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg of delta 9-THC was essentially complete 2 to 4 hr after injection for both measures of performance and for both N1 and N2 amplitudes. The results demonstrate that low doses of delta 9-THC distort behaviorally relevant sensory information converging on the dentate gyrus and support the hypothesis that the psychoactive effects of marijuana may be mediated by action within the hippocampus.\r"

The effects of low doses of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) were assessed on the firing patterns of granule cells to the tone stimuli. Intraperitoneal injections of delta 9-THC at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg, produced a significant suppression of granule cell activity lasting up to 4 hr. This suppression was present in both the spontaneous (pretone) activity and tone-evoked responses of granule cells. The tone responses of cells recorded from the inferior colliculus were unaffected by THC injection at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, implicating further the hippocampus as a site of specific action of delta 9-THC. In the preceding paper it was demonstrated that such doses produced both impairment of discrimination behavior and modifications of sensory-evoked potentials recorded from the dentate gyrus. However, the influence of delta 9-THC on cell firing in the dentate gyrus was more severe both in magnitude and duration of suppression than were the effects on behavior and on sensory-evoked potentials.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to compare the response of the subclinically diseased kidney to the normal kidney when exposed to identical serum concentrations of gentamicin. This study used exponentially declining infusions based on preinfusion pharmacokinetics to achieve identical serum gentamicin concentration profiles in intact (intact-gentamicin) and subtotally nephrectomized (nephrectomized-gentamicin) beagle dogs. After 10 daily 12-hr infusions, relative nephrotoxicity was compared using serum chemistries and histopathologic analysis in intact- and nephrectomized-control (untreated) dogs. For intact-gentamicin and nephrectomized-gentamicin dogs, respectively, infusion steady-state serum concentrations were 5.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.5 (microgram/ml) and elimination rates were 0.19 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.01(hr-1) (mean +/- S.E.M.). Postinfusion histopath scoring of renal lesions (0-30, with 30 being most severe) were 11 +/- 5 (nephrectomized-gentamicin), 4 +/- 2 (nephrectomized-control), 2 +/- 2 (intact-gentamicin) and 0 +/- 0 (intact-control). Gentamicin-induced renal dysfunction in nephrectomized dogs was characterized further by administering nonindividualized multiple dosage regimens. Toxicity in the subclinical disease state was marked by oliguria and acute renal failure in contrast to the mild polyuria seen in intact animals. These findings support increased sensitivity to gentamicin nephrotoxicity in dogs with mild renal dysfunction secondary to subtotal surgical nephrectomy.\r"

  ".U": "87086361\r", 
  ".W": "Hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase is believed to exist as a complex consisting of a catalytic subunit, guanine nucleotide binding regulatory unit and a hormone or neurotransmitter receptor. The diterpene compound, forskolin, is a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase activity presumably interacting with a site directly on the catalytic subunit. Guanine nucleotides and sodium fluoride stimulate adenylate cyclase through a stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory subunit. In order to examine the role of the forskolin binding site in the rat brain, the distribution of [3H]forskolin binding sites has been compared with those of a radiolabeled guanine nucleotide analog. [3H]Forskolin densely labeled a few discrete brain regions including the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Specific [3H]guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate ([3H]Gpp(NH)p) binding sites were found in high densities in not only these areas but also in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain regions. In the hippocampal formation, guanine nucleotide binding sites were seen in the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum molecular and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. On the other hand, forskolin labeled the hilus and the pyramidal cell layer of CA3 and CA4 with high density, a region where guanine nucleotide binding was relatively low. Sodium fluoride and Gpp(NH)p were found to enhance forskolin binding in regions in which [3H]Gpp(NH)p binding sites were present. These results indicate that most, but not all forskolin binding sites in the brain, are allosterically coupled with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein. Conversely, it has also been demonstrated that some forskolin binding sites in the hippocampus are probably not guanine nucleotide regulated.\r"

We compared serial prolactin levels following perphenazine stimulation in 20 women with histologically documented tumors to those in 22 normal controls. In addition, seven women who were diagnosed as having functional (nontumor) hyperprolactinemia were tested. All subjects were given perphenazine, 8 mg orally. Baseline and hourly serum prolactins for six hours were compared. A 200% or greater response occurred in all control patients and functional hyperprolactinemic subjects within six hours following medication. Without exception, tumor patients exhibited a markedly blunted or absent response. This markedly diminished response pattern was compatible with the presence of a pituitary adenoma and suggests that the presence of a tumor interferes with normal pituitary secretory responsiveness.\r"

Still greater curtailment of endoscopic visualization can be expected when large, modified laser probes are used.

In the study reported here, the authors examined differences in attitudes toward and knowledge and treatment of alcoholism among physicians in three specialties. A questionnaire pertaining to alcoholism and alcoholics was mailed to 385 internists, surgeons, and psychiatrists at a teaching hospital. Half received a version concerning male alcoholics, and half received one concerning female alcoholics; the versions were identical except for the gender of the alcoholic referred to in the questionnaire. Fifty-three percent returned the questionnaire, and their responses showed that these physicians viewed male and female alcoholics similarly. Overall, the respondents considered them treatable but maintained negative perceptions of their personalities. The psychiatrists held the most positive views of the treatability of alcoholism and the most negative views of alcoholics' personalities, whereas the surgeons held the most positive views of alcoholics' personalities and the most negative views of treatability. The internists, surgeons, and psychiatrists reported significant differences in the adequacy of their education on alcoholism, in their methods of handling alcoholics, and in their desire to learn about alcoholism. These findings are discussed in terms of continuing education in alcoholism treatment for physicians.\r"

The PEP participants had lower scores on the Medical College Admission Test than minority nonparticipants admitted to the medical school. Analysis of the first-year performance of PEP participants, however, indicated that the participants had significantly higher proportions of pass and honors grades than minority nonparticipants in two courses and slightly higher (though not significant) proportions of pass and honors grades in six other courses of the nine courses in the first-year curriculum. In a related study, preliminary analysis showed that participation in the PEP was one of the consistent predictors of overall academic performance during the first year. Questionnaires completed by participants before and after the program and their responses to a survey at the end of their first year of medical school indicated the participants felt they had gained benefits from the program that enhanced their academic adjustment.\r"

We conducted a prospective randomized study of patients requiring tube thoracostomy for pneumo- and/or hemothorax complicating blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma in an attempt to assess the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Fifty-eight patients were included in the study. The control group (Group I) included 28 patients who received no antibiotic therapy: the experimental group (Group II) included 30 patients who received cefoxitin (1.0 gm IV q 6 h) commencing before tube thoracostomy and terminating 12 hours after its removal. The incidence of infectious complications (pneumonia and/or empyema) was recorded. Among the patients not receiving antibiotics, eight of 28 (29%) developed infectious chest complications. Of the patients receiving antibiotics, there was one infectious complication (3%). This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0227). Cultures demonstrated significant conversion from negative to positive both within each group and between groups. The organism most commonly recovered was S. aureus. Our findings strongly suggest that patients requiring tube thoracostomy for trauma, whether blunt or penetrating, should receive the benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotic therapy.\r"

Eighty patients underwent total splenectomy and 15 patients had splenic salvage operations performed. A group of 80 patients with no splenic trauma (N.S.T.) who had laparotomy for trauma, served as a control group. These N.S.T. patients had injury severity scores (ISS) similar to the patients who had splenectomy. The incidence and types of postoperative complications, mortality rates, and length of hospitalization were similar for both groups, indicating that splenectomy was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications or mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Renal imaging in the diagnostic evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma is a valuable adjunct, but its indications remain controversial. Classic indications for the use of emergency intravenous pyelography (IVP) have been liberal, but more recently the medical need, cost effectiveness, and potential risks of this approach have been questioned in favor of a more selective approach. This retrospective study was undertaken to reassess the value of emergency IVP in blunt abdominal trauma and to test the hypothesis that post-traumatic microscopic hematuria, without other physical or laboratory findings, can safely be managed by observation alone. With the aid of the computerized Trauma Registry at the University of Virginia Medical Center, 50 consecutive patients undergoing emergency IVP for blunt abdominal trauma were identified over a 1-year period. A significantly abnormal IVP was found in six of seven patients with gross hematuria (86%). No patient of 43 with microscopic hematuria had a clinically significant abnormality (p less than 0.001, Chi-square). Three patients in the latter group (7%) had IVP findings which were anatomically abnormal but clinically insignificant, while an equal number (7%) had IVP's which were inadequate or misleading. Emergency IVP is useful in patients with specific indications and gross hematuria, but patients with post-traumatic microscopic hematuria alone may be safely followed by observation. Abdominal CT scanning is emerging as a more useful study than IVP for renal imaging in the stable patient with blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic injury has the potential to alter the hepatic clearance and hence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs by a variety of mechanisms. These include changes in hepatic microsomal enzyme activity, hepatic blood flow rate, and plasma protein binding. Unfortunately, there have been few pharmacokinetic studies in trauma patients. Thus, few data are available to provide guidance in drug regimen design for these individuals. Meperidine clearance was therefore evaluated in patients with traumatic injury and an effort was made to identify physiologic and/or clinical predictors of clearance which could facilitate initial dosage selection. Meperidine total body clearance (TBC) was determined on 12 occasions at steady state following IM administration of meperidine to nine severely injured nonseptic trauma patients with normal renal and hepatic function. TBC of this drug averaged 684 +/- 206 ml/min (mean +/- SD) and was highly correlated with ideal body weight (IBW) (r2 = 0.735; F = 27.75; n = 12; p less than 0.01). The serum concentration of the acute phase reactant protein, alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), which binds meperidine and many other basic drugs increased strikingly in an apparent linear manner at a rate of 27 mg/dl/day up to 9 days after the traumatic event (r2 = 0.828; F = 42.30; n = 12; p less than 0.01). However, this increase in binding protein concentration was not associated with an alteration in meperidine TBC as has been reported for other drugs. It is concluded that IBW may be a useful guide initial dosage selection of meperidine in acute trauma patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In some patients prolonged tissue ischemia may be a problem because of delays in treatment caused by associated injuries. In order to minimize tissue ischemia times, temporary arterial shunting was used in selected patients with injuries requiring fracture fixation or extensive debridement. Forty-two patients with major peripheral arterial injuries were seen in 27 months. Thirteen patients, including ten of the 12 with popliteal artery injuries, had placement of a temporary arterial shunt. All shunted patients had successful revascularization and no complications of the shunting occurred. In the total group of 42 there was one death and one below-knee amputation. In patients with extensive but salvageable injuries occurring with peripheral arterial injuries we feel that the use of a temporary arterial shunt is safe and may prevent prolonged severe ischemia.\r"

Two hundred forty (29%) of the 825 identified burns were known to be work-related. Our findings suggest that the workplace is a major contributor to hospitalized burn injury among employed males, accounting for 60% of their burns. Young workers and black workers experienced the highest rates of burning, with rates two and four times higher than their older and white counterparts, respectively. Scalds were the most common type of work-related burn injury for individuals in each age category, accounting for 45% of the burns overall.\r"

Several cases of compartment syndromes (CS) caused by PASG application, and with sequelae such as limb loss, myoglobinuric renal failure, and death have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the amount of PASG pressure needed to produce tissue anoxia. Twelve normotensive subjects were investigated, and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) was measured beneath a full-length pneumatic splint at the following pressures applied: 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mm Hg. Without imposed pressure, mean TcPO2 was 70.6 mm Hg. TcPO2 decreased by increasing pneumatic pressure, expressed by the equation: TcPO2 = 2.3x + 65.7, where x is applied pressure in mm Hg. TcPO2 became zero at a mean applied pressure of 28 mm Hg (25-35). It is concluded that PASG pressures of 30 mm Hg or more applied to the whole limb stop microcirculation and result in tissue anoxia. Even low PASG pressures carry a high risk of precipitating CS. To avoid ischemic injury new guidelines for PASG application are discussed.\r"

In 32 cases the fracture was closed and in the remaining 28 cases the fracture was open. Forty-eight of the 52 fractures united in an average time of 16.8 weeks and there were no cases of deep infection or osteomyelitis. Nonunion in four patients required a secondary procedure to obtain union. Flexible medullary nailing is an excellent method for fixation of tibial shaft fractures because it combines the benefits of closed nailing and functional bracing while minimizing the disadvantages of each. Three-point fixation within the medullary canal maintains length alignment and avoids rotational problems. Nailing is done by closed methods without reaming. The technique allows early weight-bearing in a patellar tendon bearing cast or functional brace. Dynamic controlled motion at the fracture site leads to early callus formation which is biomechanically and biologically favorable. The procedure is relatively easy to perform, short in duration, and requires little specialized equipment. Flexible medullary nailing is an alternative treatment modality for selected open and closed displaced tibial shaft fractures.\r"

The frequency of each type of fracture decreases from (1) to (3), but the neurologic implications increase. However, treatment for the three types should be conservative, since neurologic deficit at this level tends to improve spontaneously.\r"

These fractures fall both prognostically and therapeutically into different categories based upon whether the primary mechanism of injury is rotational or compressive. The severity of the fracture, the degree of contamination, and the severity of concomitant soft-tissue injury in large part appear to determine the morbidity of surgical therapy in these patients. If rigid internal fixation can be performed in those patients with closed injuries that are primarily of the rotational type and performed with a minimum of soft-tissue trauma, this appears to be a reliable alternative in the hands of surgeons experienced with A-O technique and with this type of fracture specifically. In the presence of severe comminution and open wounds, however, the efficacy of rigid internal fixation performed by surgeons without great experience with these types of fracture is dubious.\r"

The risks of morbidity and mortality amongst alcoholics increased for chronic alcoholics (60%) regardless of sex or age differences. Mortality of occasional drinkers was 13.3%, 51% of the offenders were chronic alcoholics. Chronic alcoholism in polytraumatology appears to be a serious element since 59% of multiple injured patients had blood alcohol concentration greater than 1.20 gm/L, 65% greater than 0.80 gm/L, and 70% greater than 0.50 gm/L. Thus chronic alcoholism is a serious index in traumatology.\r"

All fracture/dislocations, with the exception of a scapula fracture, anterior dislocation of a thumb interphalangeal joint, and a fractured coronoid process of the ulna, required open reduction with internal fixation. Three patients required split-thickness skin grafting for extensive skin degloving. Two patients required immediate amputation. Late sequelae included prolonged edema, nutritional depletion, neuroma formation of the superficial branch of the radial nerve, late carpal tunnel syndrome, and partial brachial plexus palsy. Industrial roller injuries continue to be an occupational hazard associated with more severe crushing trauma than the low-energy wringer washer injuries first described by MacCollum (11). Attention must be paid to the treatment of crushed skin, muscle, and nerves, fracture stabilization, nutritional support, and occupational therapy. Concurrent monitoring for signs of a developing compartment syndrome and complications of rhabdomyolysis is essential.\r"

Review of the records at Milwaukee Children's Hospital between the years 1973 and 1983 revealed that of the 99 wringer injuries seen, 80 of 99 patients were radiographed and only five fractures were diagnosed. Of these fractures only two were attributable to the wringer device and these two required therapy. Criteria are developed to identify which patients should undergo radiologic studies. Using the criteria of localized pain or tenderness, crepitation, obvious deformity, or abnormal movement in the extremity, the two serious fractures would have been identified, and these two patients would have been radiographed. The other 78 patients would not have been radiographed.\r"
