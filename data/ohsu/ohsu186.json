At an average eighteen-year follow-up of the eleven patients in Group I, four (36 per cent) were asymptomatic, six (55 per cent) had mild symptoms, and only one had significant symptoms. Five (45 per cent) had one or more neurological findings, but none were incontinent. All of the patients in this group led an active life, and all had required only minor adjustments in their life-style. At an average twenty-four-year follow-up of the twenty-one patients in Group II, twelve (57 per cent) were asymptomatic, eight (38 per cent) had mild symptoms, and only one had significant symptoms. Nine (50 per cent) of the eighteen patients who had a physical examination had one or more neurological findings. Roentgenographically demonstrated failure of fusion did not adversely affect the results, and the patients remained asymptomatic despite the development of pseudarthrosis in one patient and bending of the fusion mass in three (14 per cent). In situ arthrodesis provides acceptable results for the patient who has Grade-III or IV spondylolisthesis and pain that interferes with life-style and that is unresponsive to non-operative treatment. In the skeletally immature patient, in situ fusion is recommended for disturbances of gait secondary to tight hamstrings and when the spondylolisthesis progresses.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and eleven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and persistent synovitis of the knee were treated with intra-articular injection of 270 millicuries of dysprosium-165 bound to ferric hydroxide macroaggregates. A two-year follow-up was available for fifty-nine of the treated knees. Thirty-nine had a good result; nine, a fair result; and eleven, a poor result. Of the twenty-five knees that had Stage-I radiographic changes, nineteen had a good result. Of the thirty-four knees that had Stage-II radiographic changes, twenty showed a good result. Systemic spread of the radioactivity from the injected joint was minimum. The mean whole-body dose was calculated to be 0.3 rad and that to the liver twenty-four hours after injection, 3.2 rads. The results indicated that dysprosium-165-ferric hydroxide macroaggregate is an effective agent for performing radiation synovectomy, particularly in knees that have Stage-I radiographic changes. Because of the minimum rate of systemic spread of the dysprosium-165, it offers a definite advantage over agents that previously have been used.\r"

The knees of most classes of tetrapods exhibit similar morphological characteristics, including a bicondylar cam-shaped distal part of the femur, intra-articular ligaments, menisci, and asymmetrical collateral ligaments. The functional characteristics are also similar, with the dynamic point of femorotibial contact moving posteriorly on the tibia in flexion, approximating a four-bar linkage system. The common design and function among knees of tetrapods imply a profound underlying similarity of kinematic principles. Despite the over-all similarity of the design of knees in tetrapods, no ideal animal model exists for the human knee. The human is the only known species that is both plantigrade and biped. By taking into account the retained complex asymmetry of motion of the human knee, such as the differentially greater femoral rollback of the lateral compartment as compared with the medial compartment, external bracing systems and designs for total knee replacement might be improved.\r"

The length of follow-up ranged from twenty-four to sixty-six months, with a mean of forty months. A 100-point scoring system was used to evaluate the outcome. Muscle imbalance developed in five wrists, the carpal component became loose in three wrists, and two prostheses dislocated. In five patients six arthroplasties (33 per cent) were considered to have failed because one reoperation or more was required for loosening of the components in two wrists, dislocation in two wrists, and muscle imbalance in two wrists. Of the remaining twelve arthroplasties (eleven patients) eight (45 per cent) had an excellent result; two (11 per cent), a good; and two (11 per cent), a poor result. The over-all rate of complications was 44 per cent. Patients who had significant preoperative deformity did poorly postoperatively. The surgeon should be prepared to perform other types of arthroplasty or an arthrodesis if the extensor tendons are structurally inadequate, as this may lead to progressive flexion deformity postoperatively.\r"

Haloperidol causes a relative imbalance of dopaminergic and cholinergic neuronal activity in the basal ganglia with a relative increase in cholinergic activity being responsible for EPS. The burn patient may be more prone to extrapyramidal symptoms because of increased sensitivity of skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions to acetylcholine after thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "As survival rates of patients with major burns increase, it is becoming more important to study the course and quality of their recovery. Few studies of the recovery of these patients exist that use a prospective design and standardized measures. This paper describes a preliminary study of the self-reported health of patients three months after sustaining a major burn. An initial analysis was conducted on selected data gathered from 29 patients as part of a more comprehensive, prospective study of burn rehabilitation outcome. Measurements analyzed included the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Health-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HLC), and the total body surface area burned (TBSA). Findings showed that TBSA was related to the degree to which patients perceived they had control over their health, but few correlations were found between TBSA, and HLC scale, and the SIP scale. On the SIP, most patients reported few or no problems, but a significant minority reported major problems in one or more areas of their lives. The problems that were reported tended to cluster in the areas of vocation and emotional adjustment. These results suggest that patients with major burns should not be considered a homogeneous group with respect to rehabilitation outcome.\r"

Also, the severely burned patient is exquisitely responsive, both constructively and destructively, to behavioral nuances in his or her \"significant other,\" typically, the spouse. Two variables, type of regression and marital status, provide an empirically derived rationale for the psychiatric treatment of behavioral problems affecting patient management, including especially (1) pain-related behavior, (2) intrusive reexperiencing of the trauma, (3) depletion/despair phenomena, and (4) problems related to scarring. Results are more favorable when regression is of the dependent type rather than primitive type. Treatment is enhanced when the partner in a committed relationship is included in the treatment program.\r"

We considered 17 possible predictors of depression (including the severity and placement of the burn and the patient's age, educational background, medical history, employment status, income level, and emotional and psychiatric history). We found that it is the person, rather than the injury, that best predicts postburn depression. The factor most strongly linked with depression was a past history of emotional disturbance. However, after being burned, a significant number of even previously well-adjusted patients show clinical postburn depression.\r"

Contrary to expectation, however, reframing ability and attitudes about burn care were not related. Staff members are quite positive about burn treatment and agree that the staff instills hope. The staff's endorsement of providing accurate information, while behaving optimistically even if pessimistic about the patient's condition, does represent possible double-binding communication patterns. Nursing managers with high reframing ability may facilitate staff coping with these issues.\r"

Long-term survival of elective resections was significantly reduced by age (0.01 less than p less than 0.025) and concomitant heart disease (0.025 less than p less than 0.05). Compensated renal insufficiency and chronic obstructive pneumopathy were not enough individually to preclude elective resection. In the emergency procedures the correlation of pre-, per- and postoperative factors to mortality was assessed: patient age (p = 0.01) and preoperative duration of symptoms less than 6 hours (p = 0.0076), arterial hypotension at the outset, during and at the end of operation (p = 0.0195; 0.0076 and 0.005 respectively), blood loss (p = 0.003), suprarenal extension of aneurysm (p = 0.0098) and intraperitoneal hemorrhage (p = 0.0094) were significant predictive factors in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis peroperative duration of hypotension greater than 30 minutes was the strongest single independent discriminator (p = 0.0076), death being caused by myocardial ischemia in elderly patients, secondary to poorly tolerated severe hypovolemia.\r"

The most frequent location both of primary and secondary aortic-enteric fistulas (AEF) is the end part of the duodenum (60-70%). In the group of secondary AEF the paraprosthetic type represents the most frequent morphological finding. The best diagnostic approach should be seen in a gastroduodenoscopy. The choice of surgical repair is still controversal. Most of the surgeons insist on a radical repair (Type A: restoration of the intestinal tract, complete removal of the vascular prosthesis, blind closure of the infrarenal aortic stump, axillo-bifemoral bypass). Type A repair is loaded with a high operative mortality (52%) and a number of secondary complications (e.g. recurrent AEF; bleeding from the aortic stump). As an alternative surgical approach the author present an in-situ-repair (Type B: closing of the intestinal defect, partial exchange of inserted vascular prosthesis, an encircling omentum sleeve covering the prosthesis and anastomoses). The Type B repair offers a time saving procedure with a reduced operative mortality (26%) and a better outcome for the patients. This method is only contraindicated in the presence of a spread infection of the retroperitoneal space including the vascular prosthesis.\r"

This study evaluated the compliance changes with time of microporous Replamineform silicone rubber prostheses. The compliance of 15 canine femoral artery interpositions (4 mm internal diameter X 6 cm length) was measured by in-vivo electromagnetic rheoangiometry immediately following implantation and at intervals to eight months. At implantation, silicone rubber grafts were overcompliant (15.0 +/- 1.1% radial change/mmHg X 10(-2); mean +/- S.E.) compared to the proximal artery (7.7 +/- .6%). The compliance of the prostheses decreased within two weeks (6.3 +/- .9%) and remained isocompliant to the proximal artery for eight months. The compliance determinations for the silicone rubber grafts were compared with those from PTFE prostheses and vein grafts acquired by the same method in a previous study. The analysis demonstrates the preservation of isocompliance of the silicone rubber prostheses compared to the native arteries. In contrast, the minimally compliant vein grafts and PTFE prostheses continued to decrease in compliance following implantation. This microporous silicone rubber graft may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstructions by eliminating failures caused by compliance mismatch between the artery and the prosthesis.\r"

Treatment by exclusion and bypass was successful. Fifteen other such cases have been reported in the literature in the last 15 years. While cardiomegaly is reversible once the AVF has been closed, arteriomegaly continues to increase or may begin only after closure. The mechanism for this phenomenon is debated. All arterial dilatations discovered during or after closure of AVF must be treated because of the risk of rupture. Prevention implies early treatment of all AVF. If the AVF is long-standing, the caliber of the artery proximal to the site of repair must be carefully measured and all dilated segments replaced. The patient should be warned of the possibility of late arteriomegaly proximal to the site of closure.\r"

The test was acceptable to the patients and easy to perform but has not in this study proven sensitive enough, as described, to detect asymptomatic (but angiographically verified) arterial lesions. The test is found valuable, however, especially in patients with inconclusive resting pressure recordings i.e. with an ankle to brachial pressure index close to 0.9. A pressure drop of 30% or more in this group of patients seems to indicate functionally important arterial disease.\r"

Ultrastructural preservation of the myocardium was studied using transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the cation contents of the myocardium were studied by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (calcium, magnesium) or electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (copper). After 120 minutes of ischaemia, areas of moderate or severe ultrastructural myocardial cell damage were observed in both groups but severe damage was more extensive and commoner in the group with no access to magnesium. Preservation of the capillary endothelium was also worse in that group. There was a highly significant increase in magnesium content, a decrease in calcium content and an increase in the magnesium/calcium ratio following magnesium-potassium fluorocarbon infusion. The copper content remained unchanged. A protective effect of magnesium was observed. The electrolyte content of cardioplegic solutions also alters the electrolyte content of the myocardium. This may be important in reperfusion.\r"

The segments were incubated in cell culture medium for 45 minutes at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C respectively. They were then perfused with cell culture medium at a flow rate of 100 ml/min, with a pressure of 85 mmHg and a temperature of 20 degrees C. After termination of perfusion the percentage of luminal surface without endothelial cells was determined by morphometry with scanning electron microscopy. The veins that were exposed to 4 degrees C had a significantly higher degree of endothelial cell detachment than those exposed to 20 degrees C (p less than 0.003). This study indicates that cooling to 4 degrees C may be harmful to the endothelial lining of veins which are prepared for grafting into the arterial system. Such cooling should therefore probably be avoided.\r"

The mean 3 alpha-diol G level in the women with IH was 487 +/- 192 (+/- SD) ng/dL compared to 119 +/- 37 ng/dL in normal women (n = 50), and only 1 patient had a value overlapping with the normal range. Since 3 alpha-diol G appears to be formed entirely in target organs and has a long serum half-life, we studied its clinical usefulness by following women with IH during treatment. In 15 of 17 women with IH treated for 1-4 yr with glucocorticoids, contraceptives, or spironolactone, serum 3 alpha-diol G levels changed concordantly with clinical responses, in contrast to the poor concordance of serum testosterone (5 of 17), free testosterone (7 of 17), and androstenedione (7 of 17). Specifically, in IH patients treated with spironolactone, serum testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione levels changed little, yet clinical improvement frequently occurred, and this improvement was reflected by concomitantly lowered 3 alpha-diol G levels. Further, in 4 IH patients, discontinuation of effective therapy resulted in prompt increases in serum 3 alpha-diol G as harbingers of worsening hair growth. We, thus, conclude that serum 3 alpha-diol G measurements are clinically useful in evaluating hirsute women and correlate with the clinical responses to therapy.\r"

We studied the serum GH and IGF-I of two such patients to determine whether these peptide hormones are normal in this clinical situation. The serum GH of these patients was found to bind normally to receptors of the IM-9 lymphocyte. The elution pattern of IGF-I extracted from the patients' serum was similar to that of (Thr59) human IGF-I after passage through a Bio-Rad P-60 column in 0.5 M acetic acid. The IGF-I was further characterized by isoelectric focusing and C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isoelectric points of the IGF-I components were similar to those of IGF-I in normal serum. The IGF-I in one patient had two components by HPLC, while that of the other patient had only one major component. The IGF-I components isolated by HPLC were normally active in stimulating [3H] alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by normal human fibroblasts. The elevated serum IGF-I concentrations of these two patients were GH dependent. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy in one patient resulted in a decline in serum IGF-I to a high normal concentration. Lowering the serum GH to subnormal concentrations by the administration of the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz) restored normal IGF-I concentrations in the second patient. We conclude that the GH and IGF-I of these two patients cannot account for their apparent enhanced GH responsiveness.\r"

The results indicate the presence of an active T4 uptake process with two saturable sites with apparent Km values of 1.9 and 141 nM, respectively, and an active T3 uptake process with two saturable sites with Km values of 29 and 650 nM. The uptake of both hormones was energy dependent, i.e. inhibited by KCN or by incubation of the cells in the absence of glucose. By analogy with similar findings in rat hepatocytes we postulate that the high affinity systems represent active transport of thyroid hormone into the cell. Preincubation of the cells with 2 mM ouabain resulted in a decrease in the uptake of both T3 and T4, suggesting that a sodium gradient is necessary for transport. Similar to that in rat hepatocytes, uptake of T3 was inhibited by high concentrations of T4, and uptake of T4 was inhibited by high concentrations of T3. These data indicate that regulation of thyroid hormone uptake at the level of the plasma membrane may be operative in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to examine whether at least a subgroup of patients with toxic multinodular goiter may have autoimmune thyroid disease. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) activity, measured by a sensitive bioassay employing cultured human thyroid cells, was determined in patients with toxic multinodular goiter and other thyroid disorders. All patients with active Graves' disease (n = 47) had detectable serum TSI activity, whereas TSI was undetectable in patients with thyroid disease not believed to be of autoimmune origin: toxic adenoma (n = 13), cold nodule (n = 5), and nontoxic goiter (n = 19), with a single exception in the latter group. Toxic multinodular goiter (n = 26) was diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory evidence of hyperthyroidism associated with a multinodular goiter on palpation and scintiscan. The toxic multinodular goiter group was then subclassified according to scintiscan pattern (type A, diffuse but uneven distribution of technetium uptake; type B, multiple discrete nodules of varying size and function). All but 1 of the 11 TSI-positive toxic multinodular goiter patients had a type A scintiscan pattern. The patients with the type A scintiscan pattern were younger and more often had elevated antithyroid antibody titers, ophthalmopathy, and concurrent development of goiter and hyperthyroidism (rather than long-standing goiter preceding hyperthyroidism) compared to the type B patients. Thus, a subgroup of patients with clinically defined toxic multinodular goiter (type A) probably have autoimmune hyperthyroidism (a variant of Graves' disease), while in another subgroup (type B) hyperthyroidism is not related to an autoimmune etiology (a variant of toxic adenoma).\r"

Although extraocular muscles have been extensively studied as a target for autoimmune attack in the disease, no system has been available to study retroocular fibroblasts in GO. We developed a technique to isolate fibroblasts from minced explants of connective tissue removed in the course of transantral orbital decompression surgery for GO. Postmortem specimens from individuals without evidence of thyroid disease were obtained from the same anatomical site. Confluent cells could be passaged at least 10 times with stable morphology and frozen with greater than 75% viability. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to study the in vitro binding of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to these cells. We found no difference in the degree of specific binding between GO cells and cells from normal individuals. However, there was significantly greater binding of IgG from GO sera than of that from normal serum to retroocular GO fibroblasts. These results suggest that serum IgG autoantibodies against normal retroocular fibroblasts are present in some GO patients.\r"

Their initial serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II responses to GH were compared with their 1-yr growth response to therapy. In the prepubertal group (n = 18) the growth rate of all but two children increased 3.4 +/- 0.2 (+/- SEM) cm (from 4.1 +/- 0.2 to 7.5 +/- 0.3 cm/yr). The mean increment in the growth rate of the pubertal group was 5.2 +/- 0.5 cm. In both groups the growth increase was strongly correlated with both the percent increase in serum IGF-I and the percent increase in serum IGF-II during the first 10 days of treatment. No correlation was found between the basal growth rate and basal serum IGF-I or IGF-II levels. In the prepubertal group of children, both the percent increase in serum IGF-I levels in response to GH and the age at start of treatment were predictors of long term growth. We conclude that this subgroup of normal short children with low spontaneous GH secretion and high percent increase in serum IGF values benefits from GH treatment with an increased growth rate.\r"

We measured thyroid size; body weight; serum T3, T4, and free T4 concentrations; and antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibody levels at monthly intervals. Based on the effects of the therapy, the patients were divided into 3 groups: 6 patients had excellent responses with return of serum thyroid hormone levels to normal (group A); 12 patients had fair responses, but 1 thyroid hormone test remained elevated (group B); and 22 patients had minimal benefit (group C) with only slight clinical improvement and transient reduction of serum T3 concentration. Mean serum T3 levels decreased significantly after 1 month of therapy in all 3 groups and became normal in groups A and B, but the reduction in group C was not sustained. Mean serum T4 and free T4 levels remained above normal during the course of therapy in groups B and C. Sixty-eight percent of patients in group C had large goiters compared with 33% of group A and 25% of group B, and those in group C tended to have more severe biochemical hyperthyroidism initially. There were no significant changes in antibody titers during therapy. These data indicate that iopanoic acid is not effective therapy for many hyperthyroid patients.\r"

The effects of synthetic PHM on anterior pituitary hormone secretion also were studied. Immunoreactive PHM was found in all tissues studied; high concentrations were found in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and parotid gland. Subsequent but smaller amounts of PHM were found in the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, olfactory lobe, and cerebral cortex. The distribution of immunoreactive PHM in human tissues was very similar to that of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and PHM and VIP were in equimolar concentrations. Immunoreactive PHM was also detectable in plasma of normal subjects, and similar plasma concentrations were found in patients with prolactinomas. Molecular sieve chromatography of extracts of nonneural tissues and plasma extracts revealed only one peak, eluting in the position of synthetic PHM. Two peaks of immunoreactive PHM were found in brain tissue; one coeluted with synthetic PHM, and the other eluted in the high mol wt region. Bolus injections of synthetic PHM significantly increased plasma PRL levels in a dose-dependent manner. However, PHM did not alter plasma GH, TSH, ACTH, LH, or FSH levels. These results indicate that PHM is distributed widely in human tissues, and posttranslational processing of the VIP-PHM precursor molecule may be different in different tissues. The finding of equimolar distributions of PHM and VIP is consistent with the notion that these two peptides are synthesized from a common precursor. The presence of immunoreactive PHM in human hypothalamic and pituitary stalk tissue and its specific in vivo PRL-releasing activity suggest that PHM may play an important role in the regulation of PRL secretion.\r"

Women of the same age but different menopausal status had significantly different bone masses, whereas a 5-yr difference in age had no effect on bone mass in women with the same menopausal status. At the menopause the hormone changes (low serum estrogen and high serum gonadotropin levels) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of biochemical indices of increased bone turnover. Neither biochemical values nor bone measurements indicated significant bone loss before the menopause. We conclude that the menopause has a greater effect on bone loss than does chronological age.\r"

After hydrolysis of incubation medium with glucuronidase, followed by extraction and sequential chromatography, constant 3H to 14C ratios of 3 alpha diol confirmed the production of DHT glucuronide and 3 alpha diol-g. The conversion of DHT to 3 alpha diol-G was higher than the conversion from testosterone (P less than 0.05), and conversion was higher in men than in women.

Sequential 24-h infusions of naloxone (10-mg iv bolus dose followed by an infusion of 30 micrograms/kg . h) or NaCl were administered randomly. Pulsatile LH activity was assessed for 48 h. Sleep was confirmed by electroencephalogram monitoring during the night hours (2300-0700 h). Significant sleep-associated decreases in LH pulse frequency (P less than 0.01) and mean serum LH levels (P less than 0.01) were found during the NaCl control studies. While naloxone infusion had no effect on LH pulse frequency during the waking hours, it prevented the sleep-associated decrease in pulse frequency and, in fact, significantly (P less than 0.001) increased the LH pulse frequency during the sleeping hours. These observations provide evidence that a diurnal variation of naloxone sensitivity exists in early follicular phase women and that the decrease in LH pulse frequency normally found during sleep is based at least in part on increased opioidergic inhibition.\r"

Firstly, the duration of action of the drugs was studied by the perchlorate discharge test, which was performed 2, 12, or 24 h after administering a single dose of 15 mg MMI or 300 mg PTU. After 2 h, the 9 MMI-treated patients who were tested had marked discharge (mean +/- SD, 65.0 +/- 15.8%), as did the 6 patients treated with PTU (57.6 +/- 26.6%). The mean values for the percent discharge 12 and 24 h after drug administration were 34.9 +/- 31.9% (4 patients) and 36.5 +/- 26.9% (69 patients), respectively, in the MMI group and 19.1 +/- 11.7% (11 patients) and 8.6 +/- 10.5% (7 patients) in the PTU group, indicating that the effect of MMI lasted longer. Secondly, the clinical effects of long term administration of the drugs were compared in a different group of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Within 5 weeks after the onset of treatment, 34 (52%) of 66 patients treated with MMI (10 mg, 3 times daily) were euthyroid, while only 1 of 17 patients treated with PTU (100 mg, 3 times daily) was euthyroid. The average time required to achieve euthyroidism, namely normal serum T3 and T4 levels, was significantly shorter in the MMI group [6.7 +/- 4.6 (+/-SD) weeks] than in the PTU group (16.8 +/- 13.7). In spite of the well known effect of PTU on the extrathyroidal conversion of iodothyronines, the serum T3 level normalized much faster with MMI than with PTU. These results indicate that in our patient population 15 mg MMI had a longer inhibitory effect on the organification of iodide than did 300 mg PTU, and that MMI was more rapidly effective in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.\r"

Serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) was measured with two well characterized antisera; an amino (N)-terminal antiserum which cross-reacts with the biologically active domain (1-34) and recognizes intact hormone, and a midregion (44-68) antiserum which cross-reacts with intact hormone and biologically inactive midregion/C-terminal fragments. Serum iPTH in both RIAs was significantly increased in the elderly population. An age-related increase was also found for total urinary cAMP and serum alkaline phosphatase, whereas the tubular reabsorptive maximum for phosphate (TmP/GFR) decreased with age. No difference was found between men and women of the same age group for serum iPTH, urinary cAMP, or serum alkaline phosphatase. TmP/GFR declined with age in men, but not women. Correspondingly, serum phosphate was significantly lower in elderly men than in elderly women. Urinary calcium excretion was higher in elderly women than in men of the same age group. Neither serum total or ionized calcium decreased with age. In conclusion, the age-related increase in N-terminal PTH and alterations in associated parameters of phosphate and calcium metabolism are consistent with increased parathyroid function as men and women age. Factors other than PTH are responsible for the sex-related differences observed in TmP/GFR, calcium excretion, and serum phosphate. The cause of the increased circulating levels of apparently biologically active PTH is unclear, but extends beyond the age-related decrease in renal function.\r"

The IGFs inhibited fat cell glycerol release and stimulated adipocyte 3-O-methylglucose transport and adipose tissue glucose oxidation as effectively as did insulin, but the biological potencies of the IGFs, on a molar basis, were 600-1000 times less than that of insulin. The insulin dose-response curve for antilipolysis gradually shifted to the left in the presence of submaximally and maximally effective IGF-I concentrations, whereas no additive response was found when fat cells were incubated with maximally effective concentrations of insulin and the IGFs. Adipocyte [125I]IGF-I and -II binding was low and was not inhibited by excess unlabeled IGF. In contrast, IGF-I inhibited [125I]insulin binding with a molar potency 1600 times lower than that of native insulin. In adipose tissue segments obtained from patients with untreated noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IGF-I and insulin inhibited glycerol release in a normal way. Conversely, neither insulin nor IGF-I increased the rate of glucose oxidation significantly above the nonhormone-stimulated level. We conclude that human fat cells lack specific cell surface IGF-binding sites. However, the IGFs definitely produce acute insulin-like effects in the human adipocyte, which seems to be mediated via the insulin receptor.\r"

The presence of CT and CT receptors has been demonstrated in many extrathyroidal tissues, including the male genital tract. CT immunoreactivity has also been found in human seminal fluid, and an inhibitory effect of salmon CT on human sperm motility in vitro was recently reported. In this study the presence of specific binding sites for synthetic salmon CT in intact human spermatozoa was investigated using [125I]salmon CT. Binding experiments demonstrated a CT-sperm interaction involving a receptor-mediated mechanism. The binding was very rapid and minimally reversible, with the maximal site saturation occurring at approximately 2 nM labeled peptide. The dissociation of the CT-receptor complex was only slightly influenced by the addition of unlabeled hormone. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled salmon, eel, and human CT produced a dose-dependent inhibition of [125I]salmon CT binding. These data fulfill the major criteria for demonstration of specific receptors for salmon CT in human spermatozoa. Owing to the key role of calcium ions in regulating sperm motility and the onset of the acrosomal reaction, CT receptors could be important in male gamete physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Slices of human corpora lutea (CL) obtained at varying stages of the luteal phase from 21 women were used to study the effect of hCG on progesterone (P4) production. Slices obtained from mid- and late CL incubated with 10 IU/mL hCG exhibited a significant increase in net P4 production (P less than 0.001), whereas slices from early CL did not. Mid-CL slices were the most sensitive to hCG (4.2-fold increase in P4 production compared to 1.2-fold for early CL and 2.7-fold for late CL). To investigate the unresponsiveness of early CL to hCG, [125I]hCG binding was studied. All early CL had LH/hCG-specific receptors, and the apparent Kd for this binding was 1.95 X 10(-10) M. Dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM), cholera toxin (0.84 mM), and forskolin (50 microM) stimulated net P4 production (P less than 0.05) in slices of early CL tissue incubated in the presence of methylisobutylxanthine (0.1 mM). Cholera toxin and forskolin stimulated cAMP formation by the early CL, but hCG failed to do so. These results confirm that hCG has an age-dependent stimulatory effect on CL P4 synthesis. Our findings suggest that there is inadequate coupling of the LH/hCG receptor and adenylate cyclase in the early human CL, which explains in part the relative insensitivity of this tissue to the steroidogenic action of hCG.\r"

In this study strong evidence is presented for the substantial synthesis from P5 of the sex pheromone precursor androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol (ADL) in human, but not rat, testicular homogenates. The 16-unsaturated C19 steroid ADL appeared after 1 min of incubation, and within 5 min reached values (17-23% of total radioactivity added as [4-14C]P5) comparable to those of the major delta 5-steroids 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Thus, in humans, as in boars, the sex attractant precursor ADL is a major early testicular metabolite of P5.\r"

Serum LH levels were determined every 10 min for 8-12 h in 6 normal cycling women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, in 9 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and in 8 postmenopausal women. A striking linear correlation (r = 0.98; P less than 0.00001) was found between the mean LH value during the study period (range, 11.1-137.7 IU/L) and the product of the mean LH pulse amplitude and frequency. The interdependence of these variables was further explored using a mathematical model which identifies two main determinants of the slope of the regression line relating the mean LH value to the product of mean pulse amplitude and frequency: 1) the set of constants that specify the biexponential disappearance pattern of LH from serum and 2) the fraction of LH associated with a given pulse which is released from the anterior pituitary after the peak peripheral LH level is reached. Our data, viewed in the light of this model, suggest that 1) the rate at which LH is cleared from the peripheral circulation (expressed as percentage removed per unit time) is independent of both LH concentrations and the sex steroid milieu, and 2) most circulating LH is released in discrete pulses and little, if any, is released in a nonpulsatile or \"tonic\" mode.\r"

  ".W": "An improved formulation of calcium citrate with higher aqueous solubility and bioavailability was sought. Mixtures of calcium hydroxide and citric acid, with a calcium to citrate molar ratio ranging from 0.67-1.5, dissolved rapidly in water, creating a metastably supersaturated solution. The presence of an excess of citrate in the mixture delayed the precipitation of calcium citrate and kept calcium in solution longer. Thus, the mixture with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25, containing 500 mg elemental calcium, dissolved in 300 mL water within 2 min and could be kept in solution for 1 h at a wide pH range between 2 and 7. Intestinal calcium absorption, measured from the increment in urinary calcium during the second 2 h following an oral calcium load (500 mg) in 15 normal subjects was significantly higher from the mixtures (calcium to citrate molar ratios of 1.5 and 1.25) than from tricalcium dicitrate. The fractional calcium absorption, obtained from fecal recovery of radiocalcium after oral administration of 500 mg calcium prelabeled with 47Ca in 11 normal subjects, was also higher for the mixture with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25. The most efficient calcium absorption was obtained with the mixture of calcium hydroxide and citric acid with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25. The increment in urinary calcium after an oral load with this mixture was 62.4% greater than that obtained with tricalcium dicitrate [0.138 +/- 0.056 (+/- SD) vs. 0.085 +/- 0.086 mg/dL glomerular filtrate; P less than 0.05]. The fractional calcium absorption was 88.4% higher (0.324 +/- 0.107 vs. 0.172 +/- 0.061; P less than 0.05). This mixture provided the highest concentration of ionic calcium, indicating that calcium (rather than calcium-citrate complex) is the fraction absorbed from the intestinal tract. This study, therefore, suggests that a liquid calcium preparation formulated from the mixture of calcium hydroxide and citric acid is more effective than a solid preparation of tricalcium dicitrate in providing soluble and bioavailable calcium.\r"

The molecule contains 4 O-linked sugar chains. In an effort to identify cancer markers, the structures of these sugar units on the hCG produced in pregnancy and choriocarcinoma were compared. hCG molecules in patient urines were purified by immuno-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. beta-elimination was used to cleave the O-linked sugar units, radioactive sodium borohydride to label them, and gel filtration on Bio-Gel P4 to size them and compare their elution volumes with those of standard oligosaccharides of known structure. A trisaccharide, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-, was found to be the principal unit attached to urinary hCG from pregnant women (10 samples). A hexasaccharide, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3(NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc-, which accounted for just 6% (mean, range 0-14%) of the O-linked sugar units on pregnancy hCG, was the principal unit (mean 52% of total, range 50-56%) attached to the hCG from choriocarcinoma patient urines (3 samples). These results indicate that hexasaccharide-abundant hCG is an indicator of choriocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "We recently described a specific, high affinity binding protein (BP) for growth hormone (GH) in normal human plasma. Little is known about the source, regulation and biological role of this BP. Because its specificity is similar to that of the GH receptor, we considered the possibility that it represented a circulating receptor subunit or fragment. Laron-type dwarfism is a rare disorder characterized by severe growth failure, resistance to GH, and GH receptor deficiency. To probe the relationship between the receptor and the circulating binding protein, we measured the binding of GH to plasma from a child with Laron-type dwarfism and compared it with that in plasma of normal children and adults. Normal plasma samples were supplemented with unlabeled GH to the endogenous GH level in the plasma of the Laron patient to yield comparable saturation of the BP. After incubation of plasma with radiolabeled GH, bound GH was separated from free GH by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. There was no detectable binding (less than 1.5%) of GH in the plasma of the Laron-type dwarf, whereas in normal children the bound GH fraction averaged 24.0 +/- 6.1% (mean +/- SD). Thus, the GH-BP is either absent or functionally abnormal in Laron-type dwarfism. This finding suggests that the circulating GH-BP is related to and/or may be derived from the GH receptor. Alternatively, it is possible that the BP plays an as yet poorly understood pivotal role in the promotion of somatic growth.\r"

Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that human livers microsomes contained several proteins related to these rat P-450s. A human liver P-450, termed HLx, was purified and found by immunochemical assays to resemble rat P-450g. Analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of HLx indicates that it is related to rat P-450s f-i and human liver P-450MP. A monoclonal antibody was used to measure the amounts of HLx in 21 human liver specimens. No correlation between the levels of HLx protein in these specimens and the patients' environmental histories was observed. However, statistical analysis of the data suggests that the distribution of HLx is at least bimodal. We conclude that HLx is a member of a family of human liver P-450s that resembles in its structure, and possibly in its distribution, several liver P-450s found in other animals.\r"

In rat enterocytes, we found two dexamethasone-inducible proteins related to the steroid-inducible liver cytochromes P-450. Induction of these proteins in enterocytes was associated with increases in the amount of a P-450p-related messenger RNA and of erythromycin demethylase, an activity highly characteristic of P-450p and HLp. Similar studies on human jejunal enterocytes revealed a microsomal protein indistinguishable from HLp on immunoblots and an abundance of RNA hybridizing with HLp cDNA. In human enterocytes the specific concentration of the HLp-related cytochrome (measured immunochemically or as erythromycin demethylase activity) was similar to that found in human liver and could account for all of the CO-binding hemo-protein detected. We conclude that the intestinal mucosa contains prominent form(s) of cytochromes P-450 similar to liver cytochrome P-450p in their structure, function, and some regulatory characteristics.\r"

Diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater for the obese (mean +/- SEM, 82 +/- 2 mmHg) than the normal (71 +/- 2) and overweight lean (72 +/- 2) groups, as were low density lipoprotein levels (131 +/- 9 vs. 98 + 11 and 98 + 14 mg/dl), the ratio of high density lipoprotein to total cholesterol (0.207 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.308 +/- 0.03 and 0.302 +/- 0.03), fasting plasma insulin (22 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1 and 13 +/- 2 microU/ml), and the estradiol/testosterone ratio (0.076 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.042 +/- 0.02 and 0.052 +/- 0.02); P less than 0.05. Estradiol was 25% greater for the overweight lean group (40 +/- 5 pg/ml) than the obese (30 +/- 3 pg/ml) and normal groups (29 +/- 2 pg/ml), P = 0.08, whereas total testosterone was significantly lower in the obese (499 +/- 33 ng/dl) compared with the normal and overweight, lean groups (759 +/- 98 and 797 +/- 82 ng/dl). Estradiol was uncorrelated with risk factors and the estradiol/testosterone ratio appeared to be a function of the reduced testosterone levels in obesity, not independently correlated with lipid levels after adjustment for body fat content. Furthermore, no risk factors were significantly different between the normal and overweight lean groups. We conclude that (a) body composition, rather than body weight per se, is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk factors; and (b) sex steroid alterations are related to body composition and are not an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor.\r"

After a fat-rich meal, the strongest known stimulus of neurotensin release, plasma neurotensin-like immunoreactivity (NTLI) was elevated from 7.6 +/- 1.9 to 15.5 +/- 2.5 pM. Plasma NTLI was measured with antiserum L170, which requires the biologically active carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide of the neurotensin molecule for recognition and does not crossreact significantly with any known natural catabolite in human plasma. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 25 pmol X kg-1 h-1 resulted in a plasma level of 14.7 +/- 2.1 pM, similar to the maximal physiological level observed after the fat-rich meal. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 25 pmol X kg-1 h-1 during 2 h, however, failed to significantly inhibit peptone meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion measured by intragastric titration. The 2-h acid output to peptone was 40.8 +/- 6.2 and 41.3 +/- 6.9 mmol during the vehicle and the neurotensin infusion, respectively. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 100 or 400 pmol X kg-1 h-1 did not affect acid output, whereas at 1,600 pmol X kg-1 h-1, which resulted in a plasma neurotensin concentration of 725 +/- 80 pM, significantly reduced peptone meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The neurotensin-induced inhibition of acid output was independent of the hormone gastrin. The present results provide evidence against a hormonal role for neurotensin in the regulation of meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in man.\r"

Plasma catecholamine levels, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary function, surfactant secretion, and release of free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose were compared in control and adrenalectomized animals. Plasma epinephrine increased rapidly at birth in controls but was undetectable in adrenalectomized animals. Norepinephrine levels were not statistically different. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and contractility increased abruptly after cord cutting in controls but did not increase in adrenalectomized animals. Lung compliance, pulmonary function, surfactant pool size, glucose and FFA levels were significantly decreased in adrenalectomized animals. These results suggest that adrenal epinephrine secretion is vital to many of the adaptive events at birth.\r"

An organic substance that has the characteristics of 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine as supported by the retardation factor values on thin-layer chromatograms, retention times of high performance liquid chromatograms, fluorescence emission spectra, and mass spectrum has been demonstrated to be present in the majority of the neonatal sera studied. A strong positive correlation between the levels of the binding inhibitor and the extent of binding defects for nafcillin has been observed. The substance could effectively reduce the total bilirubin concentration when added to the cord sera specimens. It is concluded that 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine plays an important role in drug binding defects observed in the newborn, and the inhibitor may also play a part in the precipitation of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in neonates when the substance is abnormally elevated.\r"

The bolus-constant infusion technique produced a steady state in maternal plasma of immunoprecipitable label, measured using excess insulin or C-peptide antiserum. In animals infused with 125I-proinsulin, analysis of umbilical venous plasma revealed no apparent transfer to the fetus of immunoprecipitable label. In animals infused with 125I-tyr-CP, 3-13% of the umbilical venous plasma radioactivity was immunoprecipitable, representing 1.4-5.8% of the immunoprecipitable radioactivity in maternal plasma at delivery. Gel filtration chromatography of umbilical venous plasma revealed that the immunoprecipitated moiety was a fragment of 125I-tyr-CP. Analysis of maternal plasma showed that the predominant peak of radioactivity represented intact C-peptide. A peak corresponding to the fetal immunoprecipitable peak was also present. Analysis of simultaneous maternal arterial and uterine vein plasma samples showed that degradation of 125I-tyr-CP occurred across the uterus. Studies in one nonpregnant and three postpartum animals indicated that pregnancy increased the rate of metabolism of 125I-tyr-CP. When 125I-tyr-CP was incubated with trophoblastic cells in culture, degradation to a species corresponding on gel filtration to the immunoprecipitable fetal metabolite was found. We conclude that proinsulin, like insulin, does not traverse the placenta. Immunoreactive fragments of C-peptide do cross, however, and pregnancy alters the metabolism of 125I-tyr-CP, probably owing to placental degradation.\r"

Using immunocytochemical techniques with antibodies to an alpha-granule membrane protein, GMP-140, we identified the membranes of intracellular vesicles in gray platelets as alpha-granule membranes. Gray platelets contained normal amounts of GMP-140 as measured by electroimmunoassay. The activation of gray platelets with thrombin caused GMP-140 to be redistributed to the plasma membrane surface, as in normal platelets. In agreement with previous studies, an endogenously synthesized secretory protein, platelet factor 4, was undetectable in gray platelets. However, the alpha-granule proteins albumin and IgG, which are thought to be derived from endocytosis of plasma proteins into megakaryocytes, were present in substantial quantities and were secreted efficiently from gray platelets. Therefore, the fundamental defect in the gray platelet syndrome may be in the targeting of endogenously synthesized secretory proteins to developing alpha granules in megakaryocytes.\r"

  ".U": "88008358\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported that in healthy men, changes in the production rate (PR) of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] accounted for the 80% increase and the 30% decrease in its serum concentration that was induced by restriction and supplementation, respectively, of dietary phosphorus. These changes in PR and serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D could be mediated by changes in serum concentrations of phosphorus that occur after the morning fasting period. To examine this hypothesis, we measured serum concentrations of phosphorus in blood drawn at hourly intervals for 24 h in six healthy men in whom dietary phosphorus was initially maintained at 1,500 mg/70 kg body weight per day for 9 d, then restricted to 500 mg/d (coupled with orally administered aluminum hydroxide) for 10 d, and then supplemented to 3,000 mg/d for 10 d. When dietary phosphorus was normal, the serum concentration of phosphorus exhibited the normal circadian rhythm: a rapid decrease in early morning to a nadir at 1100, followed by an increase to plateau at 1600 h and a further increase to an acrophase (peak) at 0030 h. The variation in serum levels of phosphorus can be described as the sum of sinusoidal functions with periodicities of 24 and 12 h. Phosphorus restriction for 10 d induced a 40% reduction in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus, abolished the early afternoon rise in its serum level (i.e., the 12-h periodic component of the time series), and delayed the acrophase by 3 h to 0330 h. Phosphorus supplementation for 10 d induced a 14% increase in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus but no significant change in its morning fasting level, exaggerated the early afternoon rise in serum phosphorus, and advanced the acrophase by 9 h to 1530 h. The changes in the PR of 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction and supplementation of dietary phosphorus varied inversely and significantly with those induced in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus (R = -0.88, P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that in healthy men, dietary phosphorus is an important determinant of the serum concentration of phosphorus throughout most of the day. The data suggest that diet-induced changes in serum levels of phosphorus mediate the changes in PR and serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D.\r"

In order to examine directly the effect of adrenalectomy on transport, medullary thick ascending limb (Mtal) segments were isolated from Adx, Adx replaced with aldosterone (Adx + Ald, 0.5 micrograms X 100 g X body wt X d), and control Sprague-Dawley rats. Both net sodium and net chloride fluxes were significantly less in the Mtal segments from Adx rats compared with those in the control or Adx + Ald group. Physiologic levels of exogenous aldosterone increased net sodium chloride flux toward control values in the Adx + Ald group. Net potassium flux was not different among the three groups. We conclude that adrenalectomy impairs reabsorptive NaCl but not K transport in the Mtal, and that aldosterone restores this process. This reabsorptive defect may contribute to the urinary concentrating and diluting abnormality associated with adrenal insufficiency.\r"

Myocardial energy requirements were increased with paired stimulation. The capacity of rapid paired stimulation to increase mechanical energy consumption was demonstrated in the presence of increased perfusion with the rate X pressure product and oxygen consumption increasing 86 and 148%, respectively, compared with control values. In contrast, rapid paired stimulation under constant, basal flow conditions did not alter the rate X pressure product, while oxygen extraction and consumption increased only 40% relative to control. Myocardial ATP, creatine-phosphate, and lactate content were identical under control and constant flow-paired stimulation conditions. The results of this study indicate that no detectable energy imbalance was produced by rapid paired stimulation with flow held constant at basal rates. These results suggest that the myocardium does not increase mechanical energy expenditure in response to inotropic or rate stimulation in the presence of restricted flow reserve and are inconsistent with the concept of \"demand-induced\" or \"relative\" myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), the mammalian homologue of the amphibian peptide bombesin, is present in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and appears to be a growth factor for both normal and neoplastic pulmonary cells. Previously we have reported the cloning of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and gene that encode human GRP. We now report that GRP mRNAs are markedly elevated in human fetal lung during the canalicular phase of pulmonary development (from approximately 16 to 30 wk gestation). By RNA blot and in situ hybridization analyses, GRP mRNAs were first detectable in fetal lung at 9-10 wk, plateaued at levels 25-fold higher than in adult lungs from 16 to approximately 30 wk and then declined to near adult levels by 34 wk gestation. By contrast, GRP peptide levels remain elevated until several months after birth. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies showed that GRP mRNA and peptide consistently colocalized in early gestation lung but that in neonatal lung, many cells that contained GRP peptide no longer contained GRP mRNA. The transient expression of high levels of GRP mRNAs during an approximately 12-wk phase of fetal lung development suggests that the secretion of GRP or its COOH-terminal peptides from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells may play a role in normal lung development.\r"

In the cultured cells, as in the adult heart in vivo, expression of cardiac alpha-actin (cACT) predominated over that of skeletal alpha-actin (sACT) mRNA, the fetal/neonatal isoform. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptor stimulation induced hypertrophy of these cells, increasing total RNA and cytoskeletal actin mRNA by 1.8-fold over control, and total alpha-actin mRNA by 4.3 fold. This disproportionate increase in total alpha-actin mRNA was produced by a preferential induction of sACT mRNA, which increased by 10.6-fold over control versus only 2.6-fold for cACT mRNA.

Ceruloplasmin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were therefore examined in five patients with Wilson's disease and five controls with other types of hepatic disease. Northern and dot blot hybridizations showed that detectable ceruloplasmin mRNA was present in all of the patients with Wilson's disease, including one patient with no detectable serum ceruloplasmin. However, the ceruloplasmin mRNA levels in the Wilson's disease patients were only 33% that of controls (P less than 0.001). In contrast, albumin mRNA levels in the Wilson's disease patients averaged 161% that of controls. In an attempt to better delineate the level of gene expression responsible for this decrease in ceruloplasmin mRNA, the nuclear run-on assay was used to analyze transcriptional rates. The amount of ceruloplasmin gene transcription in four Wilson's patients was decreased to 44% that of three controls. These results indicate that the diminished serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients with Wilson's disease are due at least in part to a decrease in ceruloplasmin gene transcription.\r"

We screened a human thyroid cDNA library constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11 with anti-107-kD monoclonal antibodies. Of five clones obtained, the recombinant beta-galactosidase fusion protein from one clone (PM-5) was confirmed to react with the monoclonal antiserum. The complementary DNA (cDNA) insert from PM-5 (0.8 kb) was used as a probe on Northern blot analysis to estimate the size of the mRNA coding for the MSA. The 2.9-kb messenger RNA (mRNA) species observed was the same size as that coding for human thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The probe did not bind to human liver mRNA, indicating the thyroid-specific nature of the PM-5-related mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of PM-5 (842 bp) was determined and consisted of a single open reading frame. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of PM-5 with that presently available for pig TPO indicates 84% homology. In conclusion, a cDNA clone representing part of the microsomal antigen has been isolated. Sequence homology with porcine TPO, as well as identity in the size of the mRNA species for both the microsomal antigen and TPO, indicate that the microsomal antigen is, at least in part, TPO.\r"

Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured with the pH dye, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Steady state pHi in S3 tubules in nominally HCO3(-)-free solutions was 7.08 +/- 0.03. Removal of Na+ (lumen) caused a decrease in pHi of 0.34 +/- 0.06 pH/min. The decrease in pHi was inhibited 62% by 1 mM amiloride (lumen) and was unaffected by 50 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (lumen) and Cl- removal (lumen, bath). After a brief exposure to 20 mM NH4Cl, pHi fell by approximately 0.7 and recovered at a rate of 0.89 +/- 0.15 pH/min in the nominal absence of Na+, HCO3-, organic anions, and SO4(2-) (lumen, bath). 1 mM N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (lumen), 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (lumen), 0.5 mM colchicine (bath), and 0.5 mM iodoacetic acid (lumen, bath) inhibited the Na+-independent pHi recovery rate by 73%, 55%, 77%, and 86%, respectively, whereas 1 mM KCN (lumen, bath) did not inhibit pHi recovery. Reduction of intracellular, but not extracellular chloride, also decreased the Na+-independent pHi recovery rate. In conclusion, the S3 proximal tubule has an apical Na+/H+ antiporter with a Michaelis constant for Na+ of 29 mM and a maximum velocity of 0.47 pH/min. S3 tubules also possess a plasma membrane H+-ATPase that can regulate pHi, has a requirement for intracellular chloride, and utilizes ATP derived primarily from glycolysis.\r"

Bicarbonate absorption was inhibited 29, 46, and 47% by 0.9 mM or 4.3 mM amiloride, or 1 mM t-butylamiloride, respectively. Sensitivity of the Na+/H+ antiporter to these compounds in vivo was examined using fluorescent measurements of intracellular pH with (2', 7')-bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Amiloride and t-butylamiloride were shown to be as potent against the antiporter in vivo as in brush border membrane vesicles. A model of proximal tubule bicarbonate absorption was used to correct for changes in the luminal profiles for pH and inhibitor concentration, and for changes in luminal flow rate in the various series. We conclude that the majority of apical membrane proton secretion involved in transepithelial bicarbonate absorption is mediated by the Na+-dependent, amiloride-sensitive Na+H+ antiporter. However, a second mechanism of proton secretion contributes significantly to bicarbonate absorption. This mechanism is Na+-independent and amiloride-insensitive.\r"

Isolates of the methicillin resistant strain prevalent in south east England (EMRSA) showed a low expression of protein A compared with the other strains of methicillin resistant S aureus (MRSA), other multiple resistant strains, and sensitive strains. Protein A and coagulase expression in 27 strains of MRSA from 15 countries associated with hospital outbreaks were compared with 27 strains of MRSA from 11 countries reported to be sporadic isolates. Twenty four of the 27 outbreak associated MRSA showed low expression of protein A and high expression of coagulase. Conversely, sporadic strains generally gave higher levels of protein A and a wide variety of coagulase reactions. The results suggest that many epidemic strains of MRSA may have phenotypic characteristics that distinguish them from sporadic strains.\r"

Estimates of pH on samples of fasting gastric juice from 55 of the patients were performed, and mucosal biopsy specimens from 33 patients were also cultured for C pyloridis. Active duodenitis was seen in 34 duodenal biopsy specimens. Thirty (88%) of the patients with active duodenitis had both greater than 5% gastric metaplasia in the duodenal specimen and C pyloridis associated gastritis. These two factors coexisted in only 0.43% of patients with no duodenal inflammation. When C pyloridis were seen histologically in duodenal biopsy specimens they were confined to areas of gastric metaplasia and never occurred in the absence of a polymorph infiltrate. Of the 55 patients with measurements of gastric juice pH, gastric metaplasia was present in the duodenum in 20 of 42 with a pH of less than 2.5, and in 0 of 13 with a pH of greater than 2.5. These results suggest that acid induced gastric metaplasia in the duodenum and C pyloridis associated gastritis may be synergistic in the pathogenesis of duodenitis; the metaplastic gastric epithelium allows C pyloridis to colonise the duodenal mucosa, where it produces an acute inflammatory response.\r"

The assay was compared with an established system using polyclonal antisera at both the capture and antigen detection stages. A good correlation was found, with 97.3% (125 of 128) of sera giving the same classification in both assays. Three sera were positive only in the polyclonal system.

The first problem was investigated by assessing the efficiency of various tissue adhesives individually and in combination. The second problem was addressed by optimising conditions for DNA unmasking, hybridisation, and biotinylated probe detection. Sensitivity of the final in situ procedure developed was assessed by using the detection of pHY2.1 repeats as a built-in control. Extrapolation of data showed that less than 10 copies of HPV DNA can be visualised by these procedures. HPV nucleic acid, mainly in the form of DNA, was detected not only in koilocytic nuclei but also in suprabasal cells in condylomas and CIN lesions. HPV mRNA was also visualised in the cytoplasm (and probably also nuclei) of the same cell types. These non-isotopic in situ procedures give results comparable to those obtained with radiolabelled probes, but they are less time consuming and provide better morphological resolution.\r"

The choice of enzyme used for proteolytic digestion of tissue seems to be important, and increasing the temperature of denaturation of tissue and probe DNA to above 100 degrees C greatly increased the sensitivity of the method. Difficulties in achieving such high temperatures in a controlled manner were overcome by the use of a rapid microwave heating method that can be used routinely in laboratories. This technique detected cytomegalovirus infections in formalin fixed, paraffin processed tissue sections within a single working day.\r"

Dose response relations were apparent in current smokers in terms of the white cell count and two haematological variables, the packed and mean cell volumes. These long term correlations probably reflect the toxicity of other agents in tobacco smoke besides nicotine and carbon monoxide, which act only in the short term. Identification of these agents may further our understanding of the mechanism by which cigarette smoking is associated with atherosclerotic disease.\r"

This caused the eruption to seem to \"wander.\" Patch testing with 1% acetaminophen in alcohol (300 mg/30 ml alcohol) confirmed the causative agent in one patient. Although patch testing was negative in the other patient, oral reexposure caused a flare. Acetaminophen appears to be an uncommon cause of fixed drug eruption, with a tendency for lesions to appear at the same or at different sites in flares, perhaps because of a prolonged refractory period and the tendency to become completely refractory in some locations.\r"

Characteristically, the lesions are large, symmetrical, well-circumscribed tender erythematous plaques that suddenly appear and reappear in exactly the same sites. They fade without pigmentation or any other trace over a 2- to 3-week period. Management requires recognition and avoidance of the responsible drug. Acute attacks may call for short-term systemic steroid therapy. Three examples of this overlooked reaction pattern are presented. The first case was associated with Night-Time cold formula and was proved by specific component challenge to be due to d-pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The second case was due to PediaCare 3 Children's Cough Syrup, also containing d-pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The third case was due to Visine eye drops, which contain an imidazole derivative, tetrahydrozoline. There is a need to increase our awareness that fixed drug eruptions come in two very different clinical forms: the classic pigmenting asymmetrical form, and the nonpigmenting symmetrical erythematous plaque form, in both of which the patient will give a history of the eruption being recurrent in the same area.\r"

A 0.6% incidence rate corresponds to 330 congenital melanocytic nevi in Denmark each year (range, 55-1265; 95% confidence limits).

Although these patients responded to high-dose prednisone therapy during the initial stages of acute disease, the addition of azathioprine failed to allow lower steroid doses and did not result in prolonged, complete remission. Indeed, the disease was exacerbated during azathioprine therapy, and significant side effects from prolonged high-dose steroid therapy were observed. Both clinical and serologic remission resulted from the addition of cyclophosphamide and dapsone to prednisone therapy. Thus, when azathioprine fails to produce remission or a steroid-sparing effect, cyclophosphamide may be an effective alternative. During a prolonged follow-up period, no recurrences of pemphigus have been observed, and no significant side effects of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) have been encountered. The addition of dapsone produced enhanced anti-inflammatory effects without increasing the existing or potential side effects of steroid therapy. Dapsone was easily withdrawn at the onset of remission. Thus the anti-inflammatory effect of dapsone may prove valuable in patients for whom steroids are contraindicated, who develop significant side effects during long-term steroid therapy, or for whom increases of dose threaten to enhance the possibility of catastrophic side effects.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 121 melanoma patients and 139 control subjects from the University of California, San Francisco clinics was conducted among whites to examine the relationship between number of melanocytic nevi and cutaneous melanoma. Nevi that measured 2 mm or more in diameter were counted over the body by a dermatologist and a dermatology fellow. The average number of nondysplastic melanocytic nevi that were 2 mm or greater in diameter was 97 for melanoma patients and 36 for control subjects (p less than 0.001). Relative risks were 1.6 (p = 0.43) for 11 to 25 nevi, 4.4 (p = 0.01) for 26 to 50 nevi, 5.4 (p = 0.008) for 51 to 100 nevi, and 9.8 (p = 0.001) for more than 100 nondysplastic melanocytic nevi. Relative risks were 3.8 (p = 0.001) for 1 to 5 dysplastic nevi and 6.3 (p = 0.003) for 6 or more of these lesions. Report of blistering sunburns or of a previous skin cancer and having red or blond hair at the age of 20 were also independently associated with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma. If confirmed in larger studies, the results presented on number of nevi and melanoma risk suggest a readily identifiable melanoma-prone group that could be followed to detect early malignant melanoma.\r"

Ten intradermal nevi were found among 76 new cases of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (13%); three additional examples of the combined malformation were seen in consultation. Clinically, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma associated with an intradermal nevus was typically a small, firm or hard, sometimes annular, nodule on the face, particularly the cheek, of a relatively young woman. Microscopically, the combined malformation contained narrow strands of basaloid cells and keratinous cysts in a desmoplastic stroma, intimately mixed with intradermal nests of nevocytes. Melanocytic nevi have been associated with epidermal hyperplasia resembling seborrheic keratoses, follicular cysts, trichostasis spinulosa, syringomas, basal cell carcinomas, and hair follicle formation on the soles. The frequency of the occurrence of intradermal nevus with desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and the close anatomic association of the two elements may indicate that this combined malformation is another example of epithelial induction by melanocytic nevi.\r"

We found only two previous reports of solitary fibrofolliculoma and only one of multiple fibrofolliculomas without associated lesions; a few publications describe multiple fibrofolliculomas in patients with perifollicular fibromas, trichodiscomas, acrochordons, and connective tissue nevus. We studied five new cases of solitary nonhereditary fibrofolliculomas and one of multiple familial fibrofolliculomas without associated lesions. Clinically, fibrofolliculomas were typically small growths with a central dilated follicle containing horny material. Histologically, there was characteristically a hyperplastic follicular infundibulum with a central keratinous plug, and anastomosing strands of basaloid cells branching into an angiofibromatous stroma. Fibrofolliculoma is thus another skin tumor in which patients with multiple growths showing autosomal dominant inheritance sometimes have associated abnormalities, while solitary lesions with identical clinical and microscopic features are relatively trivial and nonhereditary.\r"

A case of extramammary Paget's disease of the scrotum was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. Prior to surgery, 5-fluorouracil was applied topically for 10 days. This resulted in a sharply delineated, erythematous patch of biopsy-proved extramammary Paget's disease well beyond the original clinical borders. This increased the visible area of disease by 60%. Mohs micrographic surgery detected microscopic extramammary Paget's disease approximately 1 cm beyond the erythematous borders. The location of disease farthest from the margins was in the direction toward which this erythema was most advanced when the application of 5-fluorouracil was discontinued. At the time of writing, 3.5 years after treatment, the patient was free of disease. Topical 5-fluorouracil may have a role as an adjunct to surgery by highlighting subclinical areas of extramammary Paget's disease. It may also be useful postoperatively to detect early disease recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease in which symptoms may frequently result from impaired left ventricular relaxation, filling and compliance. In the present investigation, Doppler echocardiography was utilized to measure transmitral flow velocity and thereby assess left ventricular diastolic performance noninvasively in a group of 111 patients representative of the broad clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, all Doppler indexes of diastolic relaxation and filling differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from those obtained in 86 control subjects without heart disease, namely, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation (94 +/- 24 versus 78 +/- 12 ms) and of the early diastolic peak of flow velocity (244 +/- 55 versus 220 +/- 28 ms), as well as slower deceleration (3.4 +/- 1.4 versus 4.9 +/- 1.3 m/s2) and reduced maximal flow velocity in early diastole (0.5 +/- 0.2 versus 0.6 +/- 0.1 m/s). As an apparent compensation for impaired relaxation and early diastolic filling, the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling was increased, as shown by increased late diastolic flow velocity (0.4 +/- 0.3 versus 0.3 +/- 0.1 m/s) and reduced ratio of maximal flow velocity in early diastole to that in late diastole (1.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.9). The vast majority of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (91 [82%] of 111) showed evidence of impaired left ventricular diastolic performance, as assessed from the Doppler waveform. Abnormal Doppler diastolic indexes were identified with similar frequency in patients with (78%) or without (83%) left ventricular outflow obstruction, as well as in patients with (84%) or without (80%) cardiac symptoms. However, patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed more severe alterations in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function than did patients with obstruction. Thus, abnormal diastolic performance as assessed by Doppler echocardiography was apparent in the vast majority of the study patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, independent of the presence or absence of cardiac symptoms or a subaortic pressure gradient. The high frequency with which diastolic abnormalities are identified in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that impaired diastolic performance may be present at a time in the natural history of the disease when functional limitation is not yet evident.\r"

Of the 228 regions evaluated by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, 135 had abnormal regional wall motion and 102 (76%) of these 135 regions had evidence of myocardial infarction at autopsy. The overall sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of regional wall motion abnormality for regional necrosis or scar were 69, 59 and 76%, respectively. Of the 33 false positive regions, 20 (61%) had severe narrowing of the coronary artery supplying that region, 13 (39%) were adjacent to a region with a myocardial infarction and almost half (16 [48%]) were in the lateral wall. Eighty-three (36%) of the 228 regions were akinetic or dyskinetic, 52 (23%) were hypokinetic and 93 (41%) were normal. Sixty-three (76%) of the 83 akinetic/dyskinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction at autopsy, 14 (17%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and only 6 (7%) contained no necrosis or scar. In contrast, 14 (27%) of 52 hypokinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction, 11 (21%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and 27 (52%) were normal. Thus, the most severe regional wall motion abnormality (akinesia/dyskinesia) almost always indicates regional myocardial infarction which is usually transmural whereas less severe dysfunction (hypokinesia) is not necessarily associated with regional necrosis or scar. The severity of regional dysfunction must be considered if equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography is used to evaluate the presence and mural extent of myocardial infarction within a region.\r"

To further investigate these changes as well as their relation to common clinical variables (electrocardiographic [ECG] changes and chest pain), 32 patients were evaluated with Doppler echocardiography during coronary angioplasty. Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic function included the ratios of peak early to late and peak early to mean diastolic velocities as well as the ratios of early to late and first third to total velocity integral (one-third filling fraction). All diastolic indexes showed significant impairment by 15 seconds after coronary occlusion (ratio peak early to late filling velocity: 1.11 versus 0.96, p less than 0.01; ratio peak early to mean filling velocity: 1.9 versus 1.7, p less than 0.01; ratio early to late velocity integral: 1.58 versus 1.25, p less than 0.01; one-third filling fraction: 41.2 versus 37.7, p less than 0.01). Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated during coronary occlusion both qualitatively, as assessed by the appearance of a new wall motion abnormality on two-dimensional echocardiography (mean 28.8 seconds), and quantitatively by measurement of systolic percent area change on the two-dimensional short-axis view as well as the Doppler echocardiographic stroke integral index. Systolic indexes did not show significant change until 30 seconds after balloon inflation (percent area change: 42.8 versus 29.2, p less than 0.01; stroke integral index: 11.04 versus 9.36, p less than 0.01).

The presence and the extent of silent ischemia have been correlated with an increased risk of early (1 month) unfavorable outcome including myocardial infarction and need for coronary revascularization for persistent symptoms. Seventy patients with unstable angina who had undergone continuous ECG monitoring for silent ischemia were followed up for 2 years; 37 patients (Group I) had Holter ECG evidence of silent ischemia at bed rest in the coronary care unit during medical treatment with nitrates, beta-receptor blockers and calcium channel antagonists; the other 33 patients (Group II) had no ischemic ST segment changes (symptomatic or silent) on Holter monitoring. Over a 2 year follow-up period, myocardial infarction occurred in 10 patients in Group I (in 2 it was fatal) compared with one nonfatal infarction in Group II (p less than 0.01 by Kaplan-Meier analysis); revascularization with either coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty for symptomatic ischemia was performed in 11 Group I and 5 Group II patients (p less than 0.05). Multivariate Cox's hazard analysis demonstrated that the presence of silent ischemia was the best predictor of 2 year outcome. Therefore, persistent silent myocardial ischemia despite medical therapy in patients with unstable angina carries adverse prognostic implications that persist over a 2 year period.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was undertaken to elucidate the underlying electrophysiologic substrate in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and to identify possible predictors of sudden death in this patient population. Programmed stimulation was performed in 18 patients aged 14 to 64 years (mean 36) believed to be at high risk for sudden death on the basis of prior cardiac arrest or syncope, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring or a family history of frequent sudden death. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation was reproducibly induced in 8 (44%) of the 18 patients (Group A). This rhythm was induced in all three patients with a history of cardiac arrest. No sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced. Group B comprised the 10 patients in whom a sustained arrhythmia could not be reproducibly initiated. The electrophysiologic substrate was distinctly different in patients with, than in those without, inducible sustained arrhythmia. The refractory period was shorter at the right ventricular outflow tract (232 +/- 22 ms) compared with the apex (264 +/- 12 ms) in Group A (p less than 0.005) whereas there was no difference in Group B (271 +/- 25 ms versus 271 +/- 13 ms). The local ventricular electrogram of most patients in both groups was prolonged and markedly multiphasic. However, 5 of the 8 Group A patients exhibited a double electrogram (V-V') with premature stimulation compared with 1 of the 10 patients in Group B (p less than 0.02). A positive R wave in lead aVR of the scalar ECG and poor R wave progression in the precordial leads were more common in Group A than in Group B (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively). The reason for the distinctly different electrophysiologic substrate and the high prevalence of inducible polymorphic arrhythmia is unclear. It may relate to the underlying myocardial architecture in these patients, characterized by myocardial cellular disarray and fibrosis.\r"

An abnormal root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 ms was the most significant distinguishing variable, being present in 83% of Group I patients and in only 14% of Group II patients (p less than 0.005). The QRS vector duration was prolonged in 58% of Group I patients, but in only 9% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05).

Previous work has shown that NMR imaging will result in asynchronous pacing of the pulse generator within a given distance of the magnet. The radiofrequency signal generated by the system may also result in rapid cardiac pacing, which may have deleterious effects. This study utilized a 1.5 tesla unit in an in vivo laboratory animal to evaluate the unit's effects on eight different pulse generators from two manufacturers. All pacemakers functioned in an asynchronous mode when placed within a certain distance of the magnet. In addition, transient reed switch inhibition was observed. Seven of the eight pulse generators paced rapidly when exposed to the radiofrequency signal and there was a dramatic decrease in arterial blood pressure. Whether effective rapid cardiac pacing would occur could not be predicted before exposure to the magnetic resonance unit. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with high magnetic fields in patients with a pacemaker should continue to be avoided until the mechanism of the rapid cardiac pacing can be further delineated and either predicted or prevented.\r"

The response of aortic blood flow velocity and acceleration to exercise was determined in 102 subjects (28 young control subjects and 74 older patients) who underwent continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic examination before, during and immediately after near maximal treadmill exercise. Patients were grouped according to the results of thallium perfusion imaging: Group I = normal, Group II = ischemia with or without prior infarction and Group III = prior infarction only. A significant decrease in the level of velocity and acceleration achieved with exercise was observed both in patients in Group I (normal thallium study) (1.2 +/- 0.3 m/s and 36.8 +/- 14 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.005) and in patients in Group II (ischemia) (1.1 +/- 0.3 m/s and 27.7 +/- 11 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.0005) compared with values in young control subjects (1.4 +/- 0.2 m/s and 52.7 +/- 16 m/s per s). When groups of patients of similar age who differed in the presence (Group II) or absence (Group I) of ischemia on thallium scintigraphy were compared, no difference was found for maximal velocity (1.1 +/- 0.3 versus 1.2 +/- 0.3 m/s, p = NS), but acceleration was significantly lower in Group II (27.7 +/- 11 versus 36.8 +/- 14 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sample volume was located in the center of the mitral anulus, at the tips of the mitral leaflets and in the center of the aortic anulus. Circular cross-sectional areas of the mitral anulus, aortic anulus and aortic bulbus were calculated from M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic diameters. The varying short axis of the elliptical mitral opening area was obtained from the diastolic leaflet separation in the M-mode, and the long axis was derived from the maximal mitral orifice area or mitral anulus diameter. Cardiac output was calculated by multiplying time-velocity integrals with the different areas and heart rate. Doppler flow measurements correlated significantly with the thermodilution method (r = 0.79 to 0.93). Flow measurements at the aortic anulus were most accurate (r = 0.93, SEE = 0.589 liter/min) if the annular area was derived from the M-mode tracing. Measurement of the anulus in the apical five chamber view yielded a significant underestimation and the area of the aortic bulbus provided an overestimation of cardiac output. Left ventricular inflow was underestimated at the mitral leaflet tips and overestimated at the mitral anulus. The accuracy of pulsed Doppler cardiac output measurements strongly depends on the assumed flow area and sampling site. Both should be determined at the same level in the inflow or outflow tract of the left ventricle. Measurement of cardiac output in the center of the aortic anulus provided the highest accuracy.\r"

The previously successful use of phenytoin to treat serious ventricular arrhythmias led to the investigation for an alternative antiarrhythmic agent, in the same antiarrhythmic drug class, for those patients who develop side effects or become intolerant to phenytoin's antiarrhythmic effect. Forty-two children and young adults (age range 5 months to 34 years, mean 15.5 years) were treated with mexiletine. Arrhythmias treated were ventricular tachycardia (25), ventricular couplets (8), multiform ventricular premature beats (4) and frequent uniform ventricular premature beats (5). Anatomic diagnoses included congenital heart disease (postoperative in 26, unoperated in 2), cardiomyopathy (7), no heart disease (4) and other (3). Thirty-three patients had been previously treated with 1 to 5 (mean 1.6) antiarrhythmic drugs. In the short term, ventricular arrhythmias were effectively suppressed in 30 (71%) of all 42 patients treated. During follow-up (ranging to 42 months, median 10.6), 18 (60%) of the 30 acute responders continued to have excellent control. Early suppression of ventricular arrhythmias was more effective in patients with congenital heart disease (89%) than in those with cardiomyopathy (29%) or no heart disease (43%) (p less than 0.01). Initial complexity of ventricular ectopic activity had no effect on treatment results. Of 25 patients previously treated with phenytoin, in whom alternative antiarrhythmic therapy was required, 40% had long-term arrhythmia control when treated with mexiletine. Mexiletine therapy was terminated for side effects in only five patients (12%). Mexiletine is recommended for young patients with congenital heart disease and serious ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Hemodynamic data were obtained by angina-limited supine multistage bicycle ergometer exercise testing before and after a single 6 mg dose of nilvadipine. Compared with chest pain during control exercise testing, pain at peak exercise disappeared or abated and the ST segment at peak exercise also showed less significant depression after administration of nilvadipine. At rest and at peak exercise, mean blood pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly, whereas heart rate and cardiac index increased significantly after nilvadipine. Rate-pressure product and stroke volume index did not change significantly. Coronary sinus flow at peak exercise increased significantly and total coronary vascular resistance at rest and at peak exercise decreased significantly after nilvadipine. The plasma concentrations of nilvadipine 1.5 hours after administration ranged from 1.15 to 8.23 ng/ml. These data suggest that the principal factors in the antianginal actions of nilvadipine are an increase in myocardial oxygen supply due to increased coronary blood flow and a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand mainly by a decrease in afterload and additionally by a decrease in preload.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional echocardiography successfully displayed the location and extent of aortic root complications, annular abscess or mycotic aneurysm in nine patients with aortic valve endocarditis. Five of the nine patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis and four had native valve endocarditis. The infective process extended into the paravalvular structures, including the interventricular septum (seven patients), right ventricular outflow tract (three patients), interatrial septum (one patient) and anterior mitral valve leaflet (four patients). The amount of aorto-left ventricular discontinuity caused by these complications was quantitated in degrees of annular circumference on the parasternal short axis image and in distance on the parasternal long axis image. The echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery and were helpful in the preoperative anticipation of the type of surgical procedure required: aortic valve replacement or composite aortic valve and root replacement. Five patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis with calculated aorto-left ventricular discontinuity of 173 +/- 55 degrees on parasternal short axis images and 1.36 +/- 0.72 cm on parasternal long axis images. Initial surgical repair included three composite aortic root-valve prosthesis implants, one reconstructive procedure with valve replacement and one simple aortic valve replacement. During a follow-up period of 18 months (range 1 to 35), a second reparative procedure was required for only one patient to repair an aortic conduit to coronary artery venous bypass graft. Four patients had native valve endocarditis with calculated aorto-left ventricular discontinuity of 100 +/- 17 degrees on parasternal short axis images and 0.88 +/- 63 cm on parasternal long axis images. Initial surgical repair included two reconstructive procedures with valve replacement and two simple aortic valve replacements. During a follow-up period of 30 months (range 16 to 42), three of these four patients required a second reparative procedure: one each for repair of a paraprosthetic leak, a ventricular septal defect and persistent aorto-left ventricular discontinuity. Two-dimensional echocardiography accurately detected aortic annular abscess and mycotic aneurysm complicating aortic valve endocarditis and the resultant degree of aorto-left ventricular discontinuity. Circumferential aorto-left ventricular discontinuity with these complications is greater for prosthetic than native valve endocarditis and predicts a more extensive surgical repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The questions consisted of 12 lead ECGs with lead II and V1 rhythm strips, accompanied by brief clinical statements. Examinees chose their answers from a comprehensive list of 129 choices; the list was the same for each question. The score from the ECG examination was combined with scores from the other sections of the examination to derive a single score for the Cardiovascular Board examination using a norm-referenced method for determining the passing score. An additional trial was conducted to study the feasibility of testing for a minimal level of competence; the trial used a subset of \"core\" ECGs and a criterion-referenced scoring method based on a consensus of members of the Cardiovascular Board on the level of performance that should be expected of certified cardiologists. Fifty examinees (2.7%) failed the core ECG examination. If examinees had been required to pass both the core ECG examination and the remainder of the examination, 164 examinees (9%) would have changed their pass-fail status on the overall examination. The examination appeared to be a valid test for a minimal level of skill in this area of cardiology. The minimal level of competence was met by a large majority but not all of the examinees.\r"

In 24 anesthetized open chest dogs, Monastral blue dye (10 ml) was injected by way of a balloon catheter in the distal great cardiac vein as a marker for retrograde flow distribution. The injection rate (0.6 to 2.4 ml/s) was adjusted such that systolic pressure in the anterior interventricular vein ranged between 60 and 85 mm Hg. In 11 dogs with no ischemia and normal myocardial perfusion pressure (96 +/- 8 mm Hg), no myocardial staining occurred despite retrograde filling of epicardial veins. One minute after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, dye injections caused selective staining of the cyanotic area in 15 of 18 episodes, sparing the normal myocardium within the zone of retroperfused veins. In five dogs, with the arterial pressure less than 55 mm Hg, retroinjection resulted in homogeneous staining of all the myocardium drained by the retroperfused veins. Selective staining of the ischemic myocardium caused by retroinjection was associated with the following pressure gradients: during systole from the anterior interventricular vein to the occluded coronary artery, 31 to 58 mm Hg, and during diastole from the retroperfused veins to the left ventricular chamber, 9 to 28 mm Hg. There was no diastolic venoarterial gradient in the ischemic myocardium. In normal myocardium, retroinjection did not reverse the arteriovenous pressure gradient. In conclusion, retrograde flow is primarily directed to myocardium with low anterograde perfusion pressure. Selective retrograde penetration of acutely ischemic myocardium can thus be achieved by a mechanism consistent with the development of venoarterial and venoventricular pressure gradients.\r"

  ".W": "It is hypothesized that myocardium subjected to a 5 minute period of coronary occlusion and a 30 minute period of reperfusion has latent abnormalities that become overt when the reperfused myocardium is \"challenged\" by a subsequent coronary occlusion. This hypothesis is clinically relevant because reperfused myocardium is frequently subjected to recurrent ischemia, as in patients with unstable angina, vasospastic angina or recurrent thrombosis after initial coronary occlusion and thrombolysis. In 19 open chest dogs, the response of regional myocardial function to brief coronary occlusions was studied. Systolic wall thickening and diastolic thinning were measured using a specially developed miniature 5 MHz echocardiographic transducer fixed to the epicardium by suction. All 19 dogs underwent an initial \"challenge\" coronary occlusion (30 seconds). Thereafter, the control group (n = 8) underwent no intervention for 30 minutes, while the intervention group (n = 11) underwent 5 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. All dogs were then subjected to a second \"challenge\" coronary occlusion (30 seconds). In the control group, responses to the second challenge occlusion were the same as to the first occlusion. In the intervention group, regional and global systolic function and myocardial perfusion after the 5 minute coronary occlusion intervention returned to baseline levels, but the response to the second challenge coronary occlusion was significantly different in the intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-six pigs were randomly allocated to treatment with diltiazem (15 micrograms/kg per min) or saline solution and to a 60 or 120 minute coronary occlusion period followed by reperfusion. The treatment was begun 15 minutes before coronary occlusion and terminated 75 minutes after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the heart was sliced and incubated in triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The infarct area and the maximal transmural area of extension of the infarct were calculated by planimetry. The total number of red blood cells in a transmural section was also counted. In the pigs with a 60 minute coronary occlusion, diltiazem (compared with saline solution) significantly reduced infarct size from 9.7 +/- 1.5% of left ventricular mass to 5.9 +/- 0.6% (p less than 0.05) and the percent transmural extension from 0.72 +/- 0.05 to 0.61 +/- 0.05% (p less than 0.05). Red blood cell extravasation in the infarcted area was reduced from 161,934 +/- 59,905 to 78,525 +/- 46,484 cells/mm3 (p less than 0.05) with diltiazem and the percent transmural extension of the hemorrhagic necrosis from 70 +/- 10 to 36 +/- 15% (p less than 0.05). No such differences were observed in the 120 minute coronary occlusion groups. Mean red blood cell counts and the extent of hemorrhagic necrosis did not correlate with either infarct size or transmural extension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88008728\r", 
  ".W": "The identification of obesity as a pathological diagnosis depends on an accurate assessment of body fatness and a correlation of fatness with pathological consequences. Because total body fat varies with body weight, the proportion of body weight that is fat is probably a more reliable indicator of risk. Among obese children and adolescents, several problems have hindered the development of accurate clinical measures of percent body fat and total body fat. First, the use of direct methods to measure body composition is limited by expense and labor. Second, the relationship between anthropometric indexes and body composition in obese children and adolescents has not been intensively studied. Third, sample sizes of normal weight children have been too small to permit the development of diagnostic criteria. Fourth, the triceps skinfold is less reproducible in overweight subjects. Increases in lean body mass in obese adolescents may confound the use of the body mass index as a measure of adiposity. Current laboratory methods for the measurement of body composition include: (1) underwater weighing, (2) 40K counting, (3) isotopic dilution measures, (4) neutron activation, and (5) electrical impedance. This article examines relationships between those methods and anthropometry in the measurement of fatness in children and adolescents, as well as the difficulties in measuring body fatness and the importance of body fat distribution and its relationship to morbidity in children. Current evidence suggests an association of morbidity and upper segment obesity in adults. Corresponding studies in children and adolescents are yet to be carried out.\r"

  ".W": "From 1979 to 1985, the University of Arizona's Household Refuse Analysis Project recorded packaging and food debris in household refuse to track the purchase of red meat and the discard of separable fat in sample neighborhoods with different income and age characteristics. From 1979 to 1982, the discard rate of meat fat remained relatively constant; in 1983, the rate of discard of meat fat nearly doubled and has remained stable in all neighborhoods measured. During the same period, the purchase of red meat with separable fat (steaks, roasts, and chops) declined, while the purchase of red meat with hidden, non-separable fat (hamburger, lunch meats, sausage, and bacon) held constant or increased. Thus, two \"fat\" trends have been identified at the household level: first, the purchase of less red meat with separable fat and the discard of a greater percentage of that fat, and second, the purchase of a greater percentage of red meat with substantial quantities of non-separable fat. Whether these seemingly contradictory choices are being made by a fully informed public is unclear. It is suggested that health promoters need to communicate the fat content of all types of red meat, especially those with hidden fat, more clearly.\r"

  ".W": "Food, supplements, and fortified foods can all be appropriate sources of nutrients. It is the responsibility of nutrition educators to help consumers use those nutrient sources appropriately. Consumers should consider at least six factors when they select foods, supplements, and fortified foods: flavor, convenience, cost, nutrient content, toxic factors, and bioavailability of nutrients. Consumers are often less concerned about the latter two factors than they should be. For example, many case histories have been published on the symptoms caused by overconsumption of vitamins A, B-6, C, and D and nicotinic acid. Generally those toxic symptoms were caused by the ingestion of supplements, not foods. Current widespread use of supplements containing one or two nutrients may not only cause overt toxicity symptoms but also adversely affect the bioavailability of other nutrients. For example, ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin C appears to interfere with copper metabolism in human subjects; ingestion of high levels of zinc impairs immune function, depresses copper absorption, and induces anemia; consumption of supplemental calcium as calcium phosphate dibasic is associated with renal calcification in rats; and ingestion of supplemental magnesium depresses the apparent absorption of calcium and retention of calcium in bone by rats.\r"

Subjects had previously completed one diary and one FFQ with respect to their usual diets. FFQs and diaries were analyzed for calories, protein, fat, cholesterol, calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C. All nutrients were underestimated by the FFQ (all p less than .05). Subjects omitted foods from the FFQ and incorrectly reported consumption frequencies. Vitamin A (p less than .001) and calories (p less than .05) were underestimated by the food diary. It is concluded that factors such as frequency of eating, pairing of foods, and explicitness of FFQ items affect recall accuracy. Those factors could influence the choice of FFQ design and administration.\r"

Furthermore, the directors were asked to state the types of questions asked most frequently, the rationale for asking those questions, and the procedure used to evaluate applicants' responses. Finally, the directors were asked to rate the level of influence of selected factors that might be used in the decision regarding admission to CUP. The overall response rate was 81%. Results indicated that an interview is used in 80% of the programs. Difficulty in scheduling and in achieving a standardized method of evaluating an interview were the most frequently cited reasons for not using one. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents ranked an interview as high in influencing the decision regarding admission to CUP. In contrast, 90% of the respondents ranked completion of prerequisite courses and 86% ranked overall GPA as highly influential factors.\r"

  ".W": "The results of the current study indicate that data obtained by the dietary recall correlate highly with the children's weighed food intake if a parent or the primary caretaker providing the child's food responds to the interview. Meredith et al. found parents to be poor reporters of children's consumption outside the home. It is encouraging to note that parents can be reliable reporters of their children's food intake in the home environment. When errors did occur, they were errors in portion size, as 96% of foods eaten by the children were correctly identified by the parents. Parents under-reported only 4% of the time. This slight tendency to under-report is consistent with other reports of the validity of the 24-hour dietary recall. In younger children, parents appear to be reliable reporters of their children's in-home dietary intake. As children become older, they appear to be able to recall their own intake both within and outside the home. There are several possible explanations for these findings. First, several factors could have influenced the accuracy of parental reports of the child's intake during the day that we weighed foods. Because food was weighed in the homes, the parents undoubtedly attended more closely to their child's diet. Additionally, the dietary recalls were collected at the end of the day of observation. This was closer in time than most 24-hour recalls and may have reflected less memory decay than usual. Also, since our sample was primarily middle-class families who were well educated, the correspondence between actual vs. reported dietary intake may have been artificially enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the mortality rate for the coronary care unit group as a whole (including those patients later transferred to the general ward) was 35 versus 46% in the ward group. Congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock were the most frequent complications in both groups (47 and 30%, respectively), and they were the main cause of death. Patients with these complications were less likely to be successfully resuscitated, even in the coronary care unit. The overall incidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias and complete heart block was similar to that reported for younger patients. Eleven patients in the coronary care unit group were successfully resuscitated from these arrhythmias and eight survived to be discharged from hospital. In contrast, only two patients in the ward group were successfully resuscitated and eight (9%) patients died suddenly and the fatal event could not be diagnosed. We concluded that elderly patients with an acute myocardial infarction can benefit from early admission to a coronary care unit.\r"

Two hundred consecutive, ambulatory, outpatient, incontinent women 55 years of age and over who were seen at the Continence Program Clinic and completed a medical and urodynamic protocol are included in this paper. After a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination, urodynamic tests were performed. The urodynamic results showed that 77% of incontinent women had an incompetent urethra. Twenty-five percent had a hyperactive bladder, 8% had \"other\" types, and 7% had a normal study. Comparison of the clinical diagnosis with the actual urodynamic diagnosis for stress incontinence revealed a 78% accuracy and only a 6% false negative. In contrast, a similar comparison for urge incontinence found only 44% accurate and 45% false negative. Analysis of the urodynamic tests revealed that the simple provocative full-bladder stress test was as effective as the radiographic or electronic pressure measurement in detecting incompetent urethra producing stress urinary incontinence. Provocative upright cystometry was helpful in uncovering 33% of hyperactive bladders not provoked in the supine position. Complex urodynamic tests should be reserved for unexplained incontinence or when symptomatology is complex.\r"

Patients were randomly given 400 mg cimetidine q.i.d. or a suspension of 1 g sucralfate q.i.d. for a period of 8 weeks. Forty patients were evaluated after 8 weeks. Symptomatic improvement was good and was comparable in both groups. We saw side-effects in only three patients, two on sucralfate and one on cimetidine, and these did not necessitate withdrawal from the study. Endoscopy showed improvement of esophagitis in 53% and healing in 31% of patients after sucralfate treatment. With cimetidine, improvement was seen in 67% and healing in 14%. One patient on cimetidine developed a stricture during treatment. We conclude that treatment with sucralfate improves symptoms and lessens severity of reflux esophagitis and that the results with sucralfate appear to be comparable to those obtained with cimetidine. Sucralfate is a valid alternative to H2-receptor antagonist therapy.\r"

After randomization, the patients either recorded pain intensity (VAS) or pain intensity and duration (DIBS) four times daily during a 4-week period for 1 preliminary week without medication, followed by 3 weeks of antacid treatment. For both scales there was a high degree of compliance, and they seemed equally reliable and sensitive to changes in pain experience. Since DIBS yields more clinically useful information, this scale appears to be preferable for the monitoring of gastrointestinal pain.\r"

Radionuclide uptake by the gut was seen in 84% of the patients with active inflammation. We compared the extent of the disease displayed by IAS with the findings obtained by either radiological or endoscopic studies or at surgery. In two-thirds of the patients, the IAS gave an accurate evaluation of the extent of the disease (sensitivity 68%). False-positive IASs were not seen in small bowel disease (specificity 100%), but were observed on 4 occasions on the colon (specificity 86%). The intensity of the radionuclide uptake could not be correlated with the clinical activity of the disease as evaluated by the Crohn's disease activity index. These results suggest that IAS is not superior to the standard procedures used to detect and localize inflammatory bowel disease and that IAS cannot replace these techniques. However, the simplicity of IAS and the complete lack of complications associated with its use render it useful in the evaluation of the extent and distribution of inflammation in some patients, mainly those with severe disease in whom standard diagnostic procedures would be contraindicated.\r"

Laxative intake increased with age, so that habitual consumption was more frequent in patients with long-standing (greater than 10 years) constipation. Although habitual laxative users had a consistent trend toward lower bowel frequency and prolonged TGITT, no relationship was found among intake and observed bowel frequency, TGITT, or large bowel segmental transit time. Although laxatives induced more satisfactory or less difficult evacuations, they also caused diarrhea and mucus in the stool. Laxative consumption did not bring about any detectable improvement in the abdominal or extraabdominal symptoms usually associated with constipation.\r"

All four cases showed sinusoidal infiltration by myeloid cells (from very mild to obvious) and an increased perisinusoidal collagen network. Under electron microscopy we observed (a) the collagenization of the Disse space, (b) myeloid cells in the lumen and the Disse space, (c) the transformation of perisinusoidal cells into transitional cells, and (d) fragments of basement membrane-like material. It is possible that all these abnormalities, and not only sinusoidal infiltration, contribute to increase vascular resistance, even when there is no clinical evidence of portal hypertension unrelated to vascular thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "The normal steady state production of natural killer (NK) cells in the bone marrow and spleen was characterized with cytokinetic technics. We developed a protocol to enrich for NK cells in bone marrow and demonstrate that target binding can be used as a criterion for marrow NK cells if nonspecifically \"sticky\" cells are eliminated. The selected population of B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphoid cells was comprised mainly of lymphocytes, of which 80% were NK-1.1+. B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphocytes that bound to YAC-1 could be characterized as two populations on the basis of morphology and proliferative status: large, proliferating target-binding cells (TBC), of which 25% were in S phase of the mitotic cycle, and small postmitotic TBC. Pulse and chase studies indicated that the small TBC in bone marrow were derived from an immediate proliferating precursor, presumably the large TBC, which were, in turn, derived from a precursor population that was more rapidly proliferating. In contrast, few if any splenic TBC were labeled after a 30-min pulse with [3H]TdR and significant numbers of labeled TBC did not appear in the spleen until 2 or more days after the pulse label. Surprisingly, some of the splenic TBC were relatively long lived and survived 2 mo or longer. These studies are the first to directly characterize the production of NK cells in situ in normal marrow. We demonstrate that the marrow is the primary site of production of NK cells and that little, if any, proliferation of NK cells occurs in the periphery of unstimulated mice. The data suggest the existence in the bone marrow of at least three compartments in the NK lineage: a rapidly proliferating NK precursor population, a less rapidly proliferating population of large TBC, and a population of small postmitotic TBC.\r"

In the current study, we compared the capacity of normal adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cord blood mononuclear cells to produce IgM RF. Although both populations of cells consistently produced IgM RF in response to SAC, the quantity of RF produced by cord blood cells (128 +/- 18 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) greatly exceeded that of adult cells (37 +/- 5 ng/ml, p less than 0.0005) even though both populations of cells demonstrated comparable total IgM responses. Remarkably, 16.7% of total IgM produced by cord blood cells in response to SAC showed RF activity compared to only 3.4% (p less than 0.0001) of the total IgM produced by SAC-stimulated adult cells. Thus, precursors of IgM RF-secreting cells are not only a consistent feature of the normal adult human B cell repertoire, but they are especially represented at the time of birth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IgM RF originates from germ line genes and underscore the utility of SAC as a probe for analyzing the production of this autoantibody.\r"

Of a panel of six individual lymphokines and monokines tested for effects in this system, both murine and human forms of the lymphokines colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma, and human B cell growth factor significantly arrested embryonic development over a wide concentration range. The monokines, interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, also had significant effects but only at high doses. These results indicate that products of activated lymphocytes and macrophages can have detrimental effects on preimplantation embryos. Early abortion could result from local (intrauterine) production of such embryotoxic factors by activated lymphocytes and macrophages in response to stimulation by microorganisms or reproductive tissue antigens.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antiadenosine receptor antibodies have been raised by an auto-anti-idiotypic approach. BALB/c mice were immunized with adenosine 6-aminocaproyl-bovine serum albumin. Hybridoma cell lines were raised and lines that secreted antibodies that bound to rabbit antiadenosine antibodies were obtained. Two such monoclonal antibodies, AA18 and AA21, were studied in detail and found to be directed at adenosine receptors by the following criteria. They inhibited the binding of [3H] adenosine to rabbit antiadenosine antibodies that had binding characteristics similar to those of adenosine receptors. They bound to rat brain membranes and binding could be inhibited by N6-cyclohexyladenosine and L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, both adenosine receptor agonists. They also inhibited the binding of [3H]L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine to rat brain membranes. In functional assays, they inhibited adenylate cyclase of rat brain membranes, but had no effect on adenylate cyclase of rat hepatic membranes, indicating that they mimic agonists of the A1 receptor, therefore, carrying an \"internal image\" of the adenosine molecule. When adenosine receptors of rat brain membranes were solubilized with 1% cholic acid, partially purified on an adenosine 6-aminocaproyl AH-Sepharose column and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, both AA18 and AA21 recognized a 62,000 band under nonreducing conditions, and a major band of 36,000 under reducing conditions. We conclude that the auto-anti-idiotypic route has yielded specific antibodies that recognize the A1 adenosine receptor.\r"

  ".W": "High affinity murine A/J anti-digoxin monoclonal antibodies exhibit diversity in binding specificity for structurally related cardiac glycosides. They utilize several VH and VL genes. Among this diverse set, however, five antibodies share V region amino-terminal sequences that are remarkably homologous. The five antibodies were divided into three subsets based on different fine specificity-binding patterns. Therefore, complete V region sequences were determined by Edman degradation and by nucleotide sequence analysis. The VH region homology among the five antibodies was 84 to 100% and the VL region homology was 89 to 99%. The sequence data are consistent with the use of single (or closely related) VH and VL genes encoding the five antibodies. Four antibodies, derived from the same fusion (40-40, 40-120, 40-140, and 40-160), use identical D, JH2, and JK5 gene segments and identical junctions suggesting that they are clonally related. The fifth antibody (35-20) uses different D and JH1 gene segments but the same JK5 gene segment. All five antibodies share a cross-reactive idiotype. The three antibodies that exhibit the greatest degree of homology (40-40, 40-120, and 40-140) also share indistinguishable antigen-binding patterns as well as private idiotopes not present on the other two antibodies. Antibody 40-160, which has the next most homologous sequence, shares idiotopes with the first set but binds preferentially to different sites on the hapten, whereas antibody 35-20 has the most divergent sequence. In general, the degree of sequence homology among the five antibodies correlates with their hierarchical order based on hapten and idiotype fine specificity patterns.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro model system was used to define the mechanism of interaction between human neutrophils and lymphocytes. Blood mononuclear leukocytes were exposed to purified neutrophils in the presence of a neutrophil-activating agent (phorbol ester, lectin, or opsonized particle). The treated mononuclear cells displayed a marked decrease in both natural killer activity and mitogen-dependent DNA synthesis, but no change in viability. This functional suppression was dependent on neutrophil number, stimulus concentration, and duration of exposure. Lymphocytes were protected by addition of catalase, but not superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils defective in oxidative metabolism (chronic granulomatous disease) failed to suppress lymphocyte function unless an H2O2-generating system, glucose oxidase plus glucose, was added. The patients' neutrophils provided a factor, possibly myeloperoxidase, which interacted with the glucose oxidase system. The immunosuppressive effect of normal neutrophils was diminished when chloride was omitted from the cultures and was enhanced when chloride was replaced by iodide. Myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils were partially defective in suppressing lymphocytes and this was corrected by addition of purified myeloperoxidase. Paradoxically, azide caused enhancement of suppression that depended on the neutrophil oxidative burst, but not on myeloperoxidase and was mediated at least in part by an effect of azide on the target mononuclear leukocytes. These data indicate that suppression of lymphocyte function by activated neutrophils is mediated by the secretion of myeloperoxidase and H2O2 that react with halides to form immunosuppressive products. Moreover, the mononuclear leukocytes contain an azide-sensitive factor, probably catalase, which provides partial protection against injury by neutrophil products. These dynamic interactions may be important local determinants of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the clotting associated with IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the mouse by injecting monoclonal mouse anti-dintrophenyl IgE antibodies i.d. and, the next day, administering 125I-guinea pig fibrinogen i.v. 10 to 30 min before i.v. antigen (2,4-dinitrophenylated human serum albumin) challenge. In normal mice, 2-hr passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reactions were associated with substantial leakage of 125I-fibrinogen and deposition of 125I-fibrin. Thus, ears injected with IgE contained up to six times the total cpm of 125I and up to 30 times the cross-linked 125I-fibrin-associated cpm of 125I than did control ears. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 125I-fibrin deposition associated with the PCA reactions was dependent on the activity of mast cells: 1) Mast cell degranulation occurred at sites of PCA reactions. 2) Antigen-induced influx of 125I-fibrinogen and deposition of 125I-fibrin were virtually abolished by heating the IgE (56 degrees C, 1 hr) before i.d. injection. 3) Little or no IgE-dependent 125I-fibrinogen influx or 125I-fibrin deposition occurred in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv or WCB6F1-S1/S1d mice X 4) Adoptive transfer of cutaneous mast cell populations into WBB6F1-W/Wv mice (by each of three approaches: i.v. transplantation of normal bone marrow cells or local i.d. injection of cultured, growth factor-dependent mast cells 2 days or 9 to 10 wk before antigen challenge) conferred on the recipients the ability to express the 125I-fibrinogen influx and 125I-fibrin deposition associated with PCA reactions. These data demonstrate that 125I-fibrinogen influx and 125I-fibrin deposition occurs in association with PCA reactions in the mouse, and that the reaction is largely or entirely dependent on the function of cutaneous mast cells. The experiments also demonstrate the utility of a novel model system for the analysis of mast cell function in vivo: WBB6F1-W/Wv mice locally reconstituted with mast cells by the injection of mast cell populations generated in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (mAb), B16G, was raised from BALB/c mice immunized with affinity-purified T suppressor factors (TsF) specific for the murine mastocytoma P815. This mAb was found to bind to polyclonal TsF isolated from the spleens of tumor-bearing animals, and to the TsF released from a P815-specific T cell hybridoma. In this study, B16G was tested for its reactivity with TsF produced in the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl hapten system. The factors from three types of suppressor T cell hybridomas, each representing the immortalized analogues of the inducer T suppressor cell (Ts1), transducer suppressor cell (Ts2), and effector suppressor cell (Ts3) network populations, were tested. B16G was found to be reactive with two sources of TsF1 as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and delayed-type hypersensitivity bioassay. By contrast, TsF2 and TsF3 were nonreactive with B16G. These results indicate that B16G recognizes class-specific suppressor factor determinants, and that the transducer/effector factors of the network are apparently serologically distinct. Because the B16G mAb fails to recognize 4-hydroxy-3-nitro-phenyl acetyl-specific TsF3 that share idiotype-related determinants with TsF1 yet binds to TsF1 molecules that have interacted with antigen, the binding is apparently independent of the site of antigen recognition. Additionally, the results show that the tumor-specific TsF1 raised in one suppressor system share serologic determinants with anti-hapten TsF1 raised in another.\r"

  ".W": "Conditions necessary for in vitro chain recombination of high affinity (10(9) to 10(12) M-1) antidigoxin monoclonal antibodies resulted in decreased affinity for both intact \"native\" and chain recombinant molecules. Chain recombination by somatic cell fusion was used instead to study the effects on antigen specificity and idiotypy of recombinants in which an homologous light (L) chain substituted for the parental L chain. The antidigoxin antibody 26-10 utilizes a VL sequence highly homologous to that of antibody 40-20, an antidigoxin antibody which uses a different VH gene than does 26-10 and lacks significant reactivity with an anti-26-10 idiotypic serum. The drug-marked antidigoxin cell line 26-10 (gamma 2a, kappa) and a drug-marked light chain producing variant of antidigoxin hybridoma 45-20 (lambda 1) which lacks both digoxin binding and idiotypy were fused. The fusion progeny (gamma 2a, kappa, lambda 1) which binds digoxin and is idiotype-positive, was selected for kappa loss (resulting in loss of digoxin and idiotype binding) and then fused with a heavy (H) chain loss variant of antidigoxin hybridoma 40-20 (kappa, digoxin nonbinding, idiotype negative). The resultant cell line CR-57 (gamma 2a, kappa, lambda) secretes antibodies which assemble the 26-10 H chain with both the 40-20 kappa-chain and the 45-20 lambda 1-chain. The affinity purified recombinant species consisting of 26-10 H chain and 40-20 kappa-chain expresses complete 26-10 idiotypic determinants. However, this recombinant antibody binds digoxin with decreased affinity and altered specificity relative to native 26-10. The binding specificity pattern nonetheless is most similar to the H chain donor. Amino acid and nucleotide sequence analyses of the respective light chains demonstrate six variable region differences between them, two of which are in complementarity-determining regions and the remainder in the framework. Hybridoma-hybridoma fusion provides an alternative to in vitro chain recombination for studying the contribution of chain combinational diversity to antibody diversity, antigen binding, and idiotypy.\r"

  ".W": "Using a high performance liquid chromatography assay that detects the cleavage of the C-terminal leucine from angiotensin I, we have identified a carboxypeptidase activity in mast cells from human lung and in dispersed mast cell preparations from human skin. The enzyme activity was detected in a preparation of dispersed human mast cells from lung of greater than 99% purity and was released with histamine after stimulation with goat anti-human IgE. In nine preparations of dispersed human mast cells from lung of 10 to 99% purity, net percentage of release of carboxypeptidase correlated with the release of histamine, localizing carboxypeptidase to mast cell secretory granules. The enzyme activity was also detected in preparations of dispersed human mast cells from skin and in extracts of whole skin. The inhibitor profile and m.w. of carboxypeptidase activity from preparations of dispersed mast cells from skin was similar to that from dispersed mast cells from lung. Mast cell carboxypeptidase had a m.w. on gel filtration of 30,000 to 35,000. The enzyme in crude lysates of dispersed mast cell preparations had optimal activity between pH 8.5 and 9.5 and was inhibited by potato inhibitor, which distinguished it from carboxypeptidase in cultured human foreskin keratinocytes and adult fibroblasts, and from other proteolytic mast cell enzymes. The enzyme activity was also inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and, to a small extent, by 8-OH quinoline, but not by Captopril, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or pepstatin. These findings demonstrate that human mast cell secretory granules contain carboxypeptidase in addition to tryptase and chymase. It appears that mast cells from skin may have a higher content of carboxypeptidase than do mast cells from lung.\r"

The chamber fluids were sampled over a 6-hr period for histamine and activated Hageman factor and plasma kallikrein which were complexed to C1 inhibitor. In 9 of 10 subjects significantly (p less than 0.01) increased histamine levels (74 +/- 11 ng/ml vs 1.5 +/- 0.55 ng/ml) and kallikrein-C1 inhibitor complexes (2.15 +/- 0.78 ng/ml/hr vs 0.51 +/- 0.09 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.25) were detected at antigen sites compared with buffer sites, respectively. Increased levels of activated Hageman factor (ng/ml/hr) were detected at antigen sites (1.35 +/- 0.60) compared with buffer sites (0.11 +/- 0.05), (p less than 0.01), in 8 of 10 subjects. Whereas peak levels of histamine were obtained after 1 hr of challenge, both Hageman factor and kallikrein activation, as assessed by complex formation, tended to peak later from the 2nd to the 5th hr. This represents the first demonstration that cutaneous IgE-mediated allergic responses are associated with local activation of the intrinsic plasma coagulation-kinin pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Bordetella pertussis and the other Bordetella species produce a novel adenylate cyclase toxin which enters target cells to catalyze the production of supraphysiologic levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In these studies, dialyzed extracts from B. pertussis containing the adenylate cyclase toxin, a partially purified preparation of adenylate cyclase toxin, and extracts from transposon Tn5 mutants of B. pertussis lacking the adenylate cyclase toxin, were used to assess the effects of adenylate cyclase toxin on human peripheral blood monocyte activities. Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of monocytes stimulated with opsonized zymosan was inhibited greater than 96% by exposure to adenylate cyclase toxin-containing extract, but not by extracts from adenylate cyclase toxin-deficient mutants. The chemiluminescence responses to particulate (opsonized zymosan, Leishmania donovani, and Staphylococcus aureus) and soluble (phorbol myristate acetate) stimuli were inhibited equivalently. The superoxide anion generation elicited by opsonized zymosan was inhibited 92% whereas that produced by phorbol myristate acetate was inhibited only 32% by B. pertussis extract. Inhibition of oxidative activity was associated with a greater than 500-fold increase in monocyte cAMP levels, but treated monocytes remained viable as assessed by their ability to exclude trypan blue and continued to ingest particulate stimuli. The major role of the adenylate cyclase toxin in the inhibition of monocyte oxidative responses was demonstrated by: 1) little or no inhibition by extracts from B. pertussis mutants lacking adenylate cyclase toxin; 2) high level inhibition with extract from B. parapertussis, a related species lacking pertussis toxin; and 3) a reciprocal relationship between monocyte cAMP levels and inhibition of opsonized zymosan-induced chemiluminescence using both crude extract and partially purified adenylate cyclase toxin. Pertussis toxin, which has been shown to inhibit phagocyte responses to some stimuli by a cAMP-independent mechanism, had only a small (less than 20%) inhibitory effect when added at concentrations up to 100-fold in excess of those present in B. pertussis extract. These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that B. pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin can increase cAMP levels in monocytes without compromising target cell viability or impairing ingestion of particles and that the resultant accumulated cAMP is responsible for the inhibition of oxidative responses to a variety of stimuli.\r"

In the present study we determined whether NK cell-mediated lysis of other herpesvirus-infected targets also requires HLA-DR+ cells. Depletion of either cluster designation (CD)16+ NK cells or HLA-DR+ cells from NPBMC significantly reduced their ability to lyse herpes simplex virus (HSV)- and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-infected fibroblasts. When CD16- and HLA-DR- populations were mixed, lysis of both HSV- and VZV-infected targets was virtually completely restored, indicating that NK cells and HLA-DR+ cells were required for lysis to occur. Cell-free supernatants, obtained by incubating NPBMC or CD16- cells with HSV-o-VZV-infected targets, contained antiviral activity and stimulated HLA-DR-cells to mediate lysis of corresponding virus-infected targets. The addition of anti-interferon-alpha to supernatants abolished their ability to stimulate lysis. Thus, secretion of interferon-alpha by HLA-DR+ cells contributes to NK cell-mediated lysis of herpesvirus-infected targets.\r"

We grew 28 strains of P. shigelloides and the type strain in an iron-depleted medium, and sterile filtrates were examined in CHO cell culture. Filtrates from 24 of the 29 strains produced elongation of CHO cells. These changes could be prevented by heating or by preincubation of the filtrate with cholera antitoxin.

The role of glycocalyx in retarding sterilization was tested by in vivo administration of dextranase, an endohydrolase that attacks internally situated alpha (1-6) linkages. Dextranase and penicillin, either singly or in combination, were used to treat experimental endocarditis. After two days of therapy, 100% of animals treated with penicillin or dextranase alone had infected vegetations, whereas only 25% treated with penicillin and dextranase had infected vegetations (P less than .01). After five days of therapy, 100% of the animals treated with penicillin had infected vegetations, versus none that were treated with penicillin and dextranase (P less than .01). We conclude that glycocalyx acts to retard antibiotic activity in vegetations and that partial enzymatic digestion of the glycocalyx facilitates penicillin sterilization of the infected valve.\r"

  ".W": "A 220-kilodalton (kDa) protein with lectin properties was isolated from Entamoeba histolytica strain HM1:IMSS and was purified by Sepharose 4B chromatography and electroelution from 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein contains 9% carbohydrate by weight; is rich in hydrophobic residues; and is very immunogenic in mice, hamsters, and rabbits. The protein binds to fixed monolayers of MDCK cells and inhibits trophozoite attachment to the cultured cells. The 220-kDa protein agglutinates human erythrocytes, and agglutination is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of hyaluronic acid, chitin, chitin-derived products (chitotriose), and antibodies to the purified protein. The 220-kDa protein is recognized by an antibody to the membrane but not by antibodies to other subcellular fractions. We therefore suggest that this 220-kDa protein with lectin properties is a component of the plasma membrane and could be one of the putative \"receptor\" molecules involved in cell and/or matrix attachment.\r"

Three serologically distinct HCV strains, UK1, UK2, and Japan, were demonstrated by IEM, as was evidence for two additional strains, UK3 and UK4. Although HCV strains and Norwalk virus were distinct by IEM, 12 of 20 patients with gastroenteritis due to HCV UK4 and two of eight with gastroenteritis due to UK2 showed seroconversions to Norwalk virus by RIA. These naturally occurring antibody responses in humans, as detected by RIA, support the concept that Norwalk virus belongs to the family Caliciviridae. An RIA for HCV Japan antigen also detected HCV UK1, UK2, and UK4 and thus appears to identify a group-specific antigen for these viruses. An RIA for antibody to HCV Japan failed to identify seroconversions in 45 of 47 patients with gastroenteritis due to HCV UK. These results may reflect different reactivities of various immunologic tests for the identification of infections due to small gastroenteritis viruses.\r"

In mice, ERA vaccine, but not an equal concentration of PM vaccine, conferred protection against a lethal challenge infection with DUV6 virus. This result indicated that the protective activity correlated with the vaccine's ability to induce immunologic memory. A vaccine prepared from a sequentially selected, neutralization-resistant, multiple-variant virus conferred protection against challenge with the parental strain, a result indicating that antigenic variation of the glycoprotein may not be the sole factor in determining the relative efficacy of rabies prophylaxis. We found no correlation between titers of neutralizing antibody and mortality rates in mice immunized with purified glycoprotein from these viruses.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium salts are the major components of pigment gallstones. The calcium species in bile that is critical for Ca++ precipitation is free ionized calcium, [Ca++]. Factors that regulate biliary [Ca++] in bile are therefore of great importance in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones. The fate of biliary Ca++ on entry into the gallbladder has not previously been studied. We here report that a minimum of 51.3% +/- 8.8% (SEM) of Ca++ is absorbed from the canine gallbladder on concentration of bile during a 24-hour fast. In addition, there was absorption of least 70.9% +/- 6.2% of Na+, 56.5% +/- 8.6% of K+, and nearly all (greater than 98%) of Cl-. Absorption, neutralization, or both, of HCO3- was also nearly complete (greater than 98%). During concentration of bile by the gallbladder, the concentrations of all biliary cations increased as total bile salt concentration increased, whereas anion concentrations declined. These results are consistent with a Gibbs-Donnan effect induced by impermeable, negatively charged bile salt molecules. Comparison of bile/plasma [Ca++] ratios with those for [K+], a passively distributed ion, was also consistent with, although not proof of, the passive absorption and distribution of Ca++ across the gallbladder epithelium. The absorption of Ca++ by the gallbladder may be a factor in the prevention of pigment gallstones, because it limits free Ca++ ion in bile, and thus decreases the likelihood of precipitation of calcium.\r"

  ".U": "88009476\r", 
  ".W": "Ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) in humans typically results from hypoperfusion, not total blood flow interruption. However, experimental studies of ischemic ARF have relied on total blood flow cessation models because no reliable hypoperfusion model has been described. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a hypoperfusion model of ischemic ARF and then to contrast it to a blood flow cessation model (renal artery occlusion). Rats were uninephrectomized, and then temporary (30 or 45 minute) partial aortic ligation (PAL) was created just above the left renal artery, yielding a renal perfusion pressure of 15 to 20 mm Hg and a renal blood flow of 0.1 to 0.2 ml/min. The severity of renal injury was assessed 24 hours later. Azotemia (30-minute PAL: BUN 47 +/- 5 mg/dl; 45-minute PAL: 118 +/- 11 mg/dl), depressed inulin clearances, and extensive pars recta proximal tubular necrosis resulted. Comparing 30 minutes of PAL with 30 minutes of renal artery occlusion revealed far less severe ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion (P less than 0.001), less azotemia (P less than 0.05), less medullary vascular congestion (P less than 0.05), and less cast formation (P less than 0.05) with PAL. However, both models induced comparable degrees of tubular necrosis, oxidant tissue stress (as assessed by oxidized-reduced glutathione tissue assay), and post-ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion. Both similarities and differences exist between hypoperfusion and blood flow cessation-induced experimental ARF. The difference indicate that blood flow cessation models may not closely simulate clinical ischemic renal injury.\r"

  ".W": "The intrarenal injection of contrast media results in a transient fall in renal blood flow (RBF) and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These effects are enhanced by dietary sodium restriction and attenuated by sodium loading. A similar sodium-dependent response of RBF and GFR occurs with the intrarenal injection of adenosine. In view of these similarities, we sought to determine whether endogenous adenosine is involved in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media. The intrarenal injection of contrast media (meglumine-Na diatrizoate, 76%) in six sodium-depleted, anesthetized dogs resulted in a 17% +/- 4% decrease in RBF and a 31% +/- 5% decrease in GFR. The infusion of the adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline (5 mumol/min), reduced the decrease in RBF to 6% +/- 2% and in GFR to 12% +/- 3% of control values. During the intrarenal infusion of dipyridamole (24 micrograms/kg/min), a potentiator of adenosine through its action to inhibit the cellular uptake of nucleosides, the hemodynamic response to contrast media was greater; RBF fell 25% +/- 4% and GFR fell 44% +/- 7%. In addition, the urinary excretion of endogenous adenosine increased after the injection of contrast media (388 +/- 79 vs. 830 +/- 231 nmol/min). In summary, the contrast media-induced fall in RBF and GFR was attenuated by theophylline and augmented by dipyridamole, and the administration of contrast media resulted in an increase in the excretion of endogenous adenosine. These results support the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine is involved in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media.\r"

  ".W": "Potassium depletion often accompanies clinically significant magnesium depletion, and magnesium replacement is most frequently undertaken with magnesium sulfate. However, inorganic sulfate acts as a nonreabsorbable anion in the distal nephron, an effect that could potentially interfere with the correction of any associated potassium deficiency. We have investigated the effect of a variety of magnesium salts, including sulfate and nonsulfate forms, on cation balance and skeletal muscle ion composition in normal and magnesium-depleted rats. Even modest amounts of dietary sulfate increased the urinary excretion of potassium in both normal and magnesium-depleted rats. During a 7-day feeding period, diets containing MgSO4 or MgO with an equivalent amount of Na2SO4 resulted in significantly greater urinary excretion of potassium than diets without sulfate. In normal animals, this kaliuresis did not produce hypokalemia or muscle potassium depletion. Magnesium-deficient feeding produced magnesium depletion, kaliuresis, and a decline in both plasma and muscle potassium content. When magnesium was restored to the diet without sulfate, urinary potassium excretion decreased, and both magnesium and potassium deficits were corrected. However, when magnesium refeeding included sulfate salts, magnesium stores returned to normal, whereas the kaliuresis and potassium depletion persisted. When accompanied by a high sodium intake, the kaliuretic effect of sulfate was increased.\r"

The quantity of iron within mucosal cells was proportionate to the degree of iron repletion. Although the quantity of iron-binding substances was similar in iron-deficient and iron-loaded animals, the unsaturated iron-binding capacity of mucosal cells varied inversely with the state of iron repletion of animals in ultrastructural, biochemical, and immunologic observations. Although only certain mucosal cells contained iron-binding substances, their number was not increased in iron-deficient animals. Greater quantities of iron and iron-binding substances were observed in duodenal mucosa than in ileal mucosa. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the quantity of unsaturated iron-binding substances within intestinal mucosal cells regulates iron absorption. These findings are only partially explained by changes observed in the concentration of ferritin and transferrin within intestinal mucosa and suggest that other iron-binding substances may also participate in the regulation of iron absorption.\r"

The three hormones in combination delayed the expression of CMV-induced Fc receptors in this cell line. However, similar effects on Fc receptor expression were observed at both first trimester and third trimester concentrations of the hormones. CMV grew well in a primary cell line derived from endometrial stromal cells. However, in this female genital line, as in the (male somatic) human embryonic lung cells, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone had little effect on CMV replication. CMV-induced Fc receptors could not be demonstrated in endometrial stromal cells. These results suggest that the variation in cervical CMV excretion during gestation is mediated by some mechanism other than a direct effect of sex hormones on viral replication or Fc receptor expression.\r"

When Staphylococcus aureus was used alone, the 50% infective dose (ID50) and the 100% infective dose (ID100) were 400 and 25,000 colony-forming units (CFU), respectively. When Bacteroides fragilis was inoculated alone, the ID50 was 150,000 organisms, and the ID100 was not confidently determined. Subinfectious numbers of B. fragilis added to the staphylococcal inocula yielded an ID100 as low as 20 staphylococci. Mixed inocula with 20 or 200 staphylococci and increasing numbers of B. fragilis yielded a dose-dependent increase in the number of staphylococci isolated from osteomyelitic tibiae. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the two inocula and their interaction to be significantly predictive of the 21-day quantitative assessment of staphylococci (r = 0.80). Synergy was most striking at low bacterial inocula. When even large numbers of S. aureus were added to B. fragilis, the B. fragilis inoculum required to initiate B. fragilis osteomyelitis was essentially unchanged. We conclude that small numbers of B. fragilis allow remarkably low numbers of S. aureus (20 or 200 CFU) to establish osteomyelitis in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether the viscera contribute to the system of membranes used in peritoneal dialysis, dialysis rate studies were performed comparing control rats (n = 9, mean peritoneal area 509 +/- 38 cm2) with eviscerated rats (n = 12, mean peritoneal area 200 +/- 123 cm2). The mass transfer coefficient (MTC) and absorption from the peritoneal cavity were calculated for urea, creatinine, and inulin, which had been added to commercially available 1.5% hydrous dextrose dialysate. Rates of peritoneal blood flow to the peritoneal membranes remaining after evisceration were similar for both groups. Urea, creatinine, glucose, and inulin were used as markers to compare control and eviscerated animals. The MTC results were (in milliliters per minute, mean +/- SEM): urea 3.0 +/- 0.3, 4.1 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01); creatinine 1.4 +/- 0.2, 2.0 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05); glucose 1.2 +/- 0.3, 1.7 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.09); inulin 0.3 +/- 0.02, 0.6 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.01); and MTC inulin/MTC urea 0.16 +/- 0.01, 0.14 +/- 0.01. Absorption of urea, creatinine, glucose, and inulin from the peritoneal cavity was only 10% to 23% greater among control animals. Whether the results were caused by nonparticipation of the intestinal viscera or other mechanisms, such as improved contact between dialysate and membrane, awaits further study.\r"

Prior studies have used relatively leaky epithelia in which the flow rate-dependent transport phenomena can be explained in terms of alterations in axial and radial concentration profiles. In this study, the flow rate dependence of either vasopressin or cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated water flux (Jv), hydraulic conductivity (Lp), and osmotic permeability (Pf) were measured in isolated perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules. Increasing perfusion rate from 6.0 +/- 0.4 to 20.7 +/- 1.2 nl/min results in highly significant increases in Jv (131%) and in Lp and Pf (120%). In this relatively tight epithelium, osmotic equilibrium did not occur. Although the mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated, the present results mandate maintenance of constant flow rates when examining the perfused cortical collecting tubular response to vasopressin.\r"

Whether Bence Jones protein (BJP) is directly nephrotoxic and how and whether hypercalcemia might contribute to this putative nephrotoxicity is currently unclear. To examine this issue, we studied the effect of modest hypercalcemia on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of rats exposed to a BJP that by itself had been found to be nonnephrotoxic. Three groups of rats were studied. All were anesthetized and underwent a baseline measurement of inulin clearance (Cin). After this, group 1 (n = 13) rats were given 2 ml of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline solution [PBS]) and were then made hypercalcemic with an infusion containing 0.048 mol/L CaCl2. At the end of 2 hours a second Cin was measured. Group 2 rats (n = 8) were given 100 mg BJP in 2 ml PBS and a non-calcium-containing infusate. Group 3 (n = 11) rats were given 100 mg of the BJP in 2 ml PBS and then the calcium-containing infusate used in group 1 rats. Rats in groups 2 and 3 also had a second Cin measured at the end of 2 hours. Renal blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. At the completion of the second clearance, kidneys were processed for renal histologic assessment. The serum calcium level measured during the second Cin period was 13.5 mg/dl for group 1, 7.9 mg/dl for group 2, and 13.7 mg/dl for group 3. No significant decrement in GFR was observed in group 1 or 2 rats. In contrast, group 3 rats had a 46% fall in GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the photodynamic effects of porphyrins, known photosensitizers, on proteins of cytosol and plasma that bind them and are implicated in their transport. Their susceptibility to photodecomposition by porphyrins was found to be higher than that of proteins with low or no affinity for tetrapyrroles. Inhibition of porphyrin binding by the addition of equimolar amounts of heme had no effect, indicating that protein photodecomposition may be induced, in part, by free or nonspecifically bound porphyrins. HBP, a heme-binding Z protein of liver cytosol, exhibited the highest susceptibility of all proteins tested, including glutathione S-transferases, albumin, hemopexin, and apotransferrin. HBP was extensively photo-oxidized, as evidenced by a decrease in its antigenicity and electrophoretic mobility, and it was cross-linked by naturally occurring porphyrins as well as by the synthetic tin-protoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin derivative. The water-soluble singlet oxygen scavengers L-histidine (50 mmol/L) and sodium azide (100 mmol/L) completely prevented the photodynamic effects of uroporphyrin (100 mumol/L) on HBP. Hydroxyl radical scavengers such as manitol and benzoate were partially effective, whereas water-insoluble singlet oxygen scavengers such as beta-carotene were totally ineffective. Preferential inhibition of cross-linking over other photodynamic effects of uroporphyrin was consistent with previous reports that cross-linking occurs subsequently to amino acid oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "A filter aspiration technique for the measurement of red cell membrane deformability described by Brailsford et al. (Blood Cells 1977;3:25) was evaluated. Pore diameters of 0.6 and 1.0 micron were used. Portions of red cells were aspirated with various hydrostatic pressures between 1 and 9 mm H2O. After fixation the filter was removed and the length and radius of the pressure-induced tongues measured by scanning electron microscopy. One to several tongues per cell were observed. The number of tongues had no influence on the measurements at pressures less than or equal to 7 mm H2O. The elastic modulus of the red cell membrane was calculated; it yielded 2.9 (+/- 0.4) X 10(-3) dynes/cm. Data obtained with filter aspiration were compared with the results obtained concurrently with the micropipette technique. A good correlation was found for normal red cells (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001). Stomatocytes produced by chlorpromazine in vitro had an increased elastic modulus with both methods. For echinocytes produced by salicylate or adenosine triphosphate depletion, the elastic modulus as determined by filter aspiration was normal, but the modulus as measured by micropipette aspiration was increased. Possible reasons for the difference are discussed. We conclude that the filter aspiration is a valid technique to measure elastic properties of red cell membranes, except when there are surface irregularities, such as those in the echinocytes.\r"

Because tubing from arterial lines and central venous catheters are composed of similar materials and are used when blood is withdrawn from patients for complement assays, a study was undertaken to assess the degree of complement activation in blood obtained from these sites. Complement activation was determined by a terminal complement complex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), C1rC1s-C1 inhibitor complex ELISA, and 50% complement hemolytic activity (CH50) assay. Blood simultaneously obtained from the arterial lines and central venous catheters had identical terminal complement complex, C1rC1s-C1 inhibitor complex, and CH50 levels when compared with blood withdrawn by antecubital phlebotomy. Because blood may be obtained from the arterial lines and central venous catheters for complement assays, the pain and possible bruising from antecubital phlebotomy could be eliminated. Furthermore, blood may now be withdrawn from indwelling catheters without fear of in vitro complement activation causing a misinterpretation of results.\r"

Temporal bones and attached external auditory meatuses were dissected, tissues were fixed in 10 per cent buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA, and embedded in JB4 plastic for sectioning at 4 micron. The proliferative activity in the epidermis of the bony meatus and in the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane was obtained by deriving the mitotic indices. After both types of ear drops there was a statistically significant reduction in mitotic indices, the values being about half the control values. The proliferative activity in the tympanic membrane was too low to permit statistical analysis, but no differences were apparent between the groups. The thicknesses of the epidermis and dermis of the bony canal, and of the tympanic membrane, were measured using a Kontron MOP-AMO3 analyser. Although the dermis was thinner as a result of the administration of ear drops, both the epidermis of the bony meatus and that of the tympanic membrane were thicker, all these changes being statistically significant.\r"

In previous studies the CDISS was used primarily by pharmacists in hospital settings to screen for interactions after the prescription had been written. This study tests the feasibility of family physicians using CDISS before writing the prescription to allow for changes in the prescription while the patient is still in the office. In a 30-day period, 103 patients were screened by family physicians for potential drug-drug, drug-alcohol, and drug-food interactions. Potential drug interactions of varying clinical significance were detected for 71 patients (68.9 percent). The prescription plan was changed for 16 patients (15.5 percent) as a result of using the CDISS. Participating physicians reported that they gained new information in 45.8 percent of the patient encounters, that their awareness of the potential for drug interactions was heightened by participation in this study, and that their exposure to the CDISS was worthwhile as an educational tool. While a few problems, mainly logistic, were noted with the CDISS as used in this study, the authors conclude that with modifications a CDISS can be of great educational and clinical value to the family physician and his or her patients.\r"

Physicians caring for nursing home patients (1) live in smaller communities, (2) spend more days each week in the office, (3) are not residency trained, (4) are board certified, and (5) have a greater percentage of patients in the geriatric age group. Physician nonparticipation in nursing homes was due to (1) too few nursing home patients in the practice, (2) inconvenience, and (3) excessive paperwork.\r"

Approximately 10 to 15 individuals die from snakebites each year, with bites from diamondback rattlesnakes accounting for 95 percent of fatalities. The identification of the two endogenous classes of venomous snakes are discussed in detail to aid in determining the proper treatment for each class. Approximately 25 percent of all pit viper bites are \"dry\" and result in no envenomation. The best first aid is a set of car keys to get the victim to a facility where antivenin is obtainable. Incision and suction should be limited to very special situations; cryotherapy and use of tourniquets applied by laymen should be avoided. Proper medical management at a health care facility requires establishing whether envenomation has occurred and to what extent, followed by appropriate dosing of antivenin. The use of corticosteroids and antibiotics is controversial. Tetanus immunization should be updated, if necessary. Although research in developing a more purified antivenin is under way, the best treatment for snakebite is prevention.\r"

Reading aloud differed from baseline measures under all treatment conditions (p less than .001) Reading quietly and interacting with a pet were slightly below baseline for all dependent variables with a slightly greater effect by reading quietly than interacting with a pet. Examination of interactions between variables revealed no significant differences. Effects on State anxiety level mirrored cardiovascular responses (p less than .001). Trait anxiety levels remained relatively constant throughout the treatments. Results indicated that interacting with a pet does affect physiological and psychological responses by lowering response levels. A parallel effect was also demonstrated by reading quietly. Given the effect of pet interaction upon selected indicators of health in well college students, these data suggest the relevance of examining this treatment with an \"at-risk\" group.\r"

Financial and emotional burdens were substantial, with ongoing stressful life events, aversive patient behaviors, and poor treatment histories. In rating family coping strategies, mental health professionals showed a high degree of concordance with nonprofessional family members in assigning priority to education on symptoms, medications, and patient management techniques. Involvement with self-help groups and physical separation from patients were rated higher than individual or family therapy as aids in coping for families of the mentally ill.\r"

Research that adequately describes the person in context as well as the influence of situations on mental state has proved difficult. Methods such as the diary and Experience-Sampling Method that explore experiences in daily life overcome some of the shortcomings of previous psychiatric research strategies, such as reliance on retrospective recall and the failure to take the variability of mental state more fully into account.

To illustrate the method, we present several examples from a secondary analysis of the Multinational Comparative Time-Budget data, based on over 25,000, 24-hour, time use diaries collected in 12 countries during 1965 through 1966. Activities that represent a small fraction of the overall time budget of a population may nevertheless yield valuable insights into a culture or group. Analyses of such mundane events as doing the laundry, transporting children, and taking a walk indicate marked differences among the countries surveyed in terms of frequencies, durations, by whom, and with whom these activities were typically performed. In the future, time use studies can be expected to contribute to the understanding of mental disorders in natural contexts. In contrasting specific diagnostic groups with normal subjects, analyses of specific activities (e.g., personal care, social interaction) or contexts (e.g., alone vs. with others, at home vs. away) may be particularly relevant. Strategies that combine continuous recording (diary) with repeated, instantaneous experience-sampling methods are likely to be the most useful in such studies of mental disorders.\r"

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.\r"

The subjects, although diagnostically heterogeneous, were representative of Dutch chronic mental patients. The Experience-Sampling Method was used to signal subjects randomly 10 times a day for 6 consecutive days to fill out self-rating forms assessing mental state and contextual information at the moment of the signal. Compliance was good. In time-allocation comparisons with nonpsychiatric subjects the patients were found to live relatively \"normal\" lives. As expected, their psychopathology was influenced by social environments such as being alone, at home, or in society at large. Contrary to other studies that stress the social isolation of such individuals, the chronic subjects reported feeling better away from home and among people than normal subjects. When alone, chronic patients reported daydreaming more and noted a tendency to drift away from thoughts about current activities. Mental state fluctuations and daily interactions, characteristic of this group, are examined in relation to theories of vulnerability and coping style of chronic mental patients, with an eye to individualized treatment applications.\r"

The Experience-Sampling Method was used on a sample of 47 Italian adolescent students to measure fluctuations in their experience. We found that the ratio of subjectively experienced challenges and skills was a fundamental parameter that predicted optimal experience as well as boredom and anxiety. In contrast, \"low\" experience in daily life was viewed as a risk factor that could be minimized to increase the quality of life. Monitoring fluctuations in optimal and low experience may therefore be an important tool in developing personalized psychiatric rehabilitation plans.\r"

The interaction between anxiety symptoms and the environment in which they occurred is explored in a case study that points to possibilities for future research and the establishment of therapeutic approaches that are optimally suited to the individual patient.\r"

  ".U": "88010011\r", 
  ".W": "Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal controls kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.\r"

The method involves the selection of samples utilizing \"insider\" knowledge and referral chains among subjects who possess common traits that are of research interest. It is especially useful in generating samples for which clinical sampling frames may be difficult to obtain or are biased in some way. In this paper, snowball samples of heroin users in two Dutch cities have been analyzed for the purpose of providing descriptions and limited inferences about the temporal and social contexts of their lifestyles. Two distinct heroin-using populations have been discovered who are distinguished by their life cycle stage. Significant contextual explanations have been found involving the passage from adolescent peer group to criminal occupation, the functioning of network \"knots\" and \"outcroppings,\" and the frequency of social contact. It is suggested that the snowball sampling method may have utility in studying the temporal and social contexts of other populations of clinical interest.\r"

The case has methodological significance in that it demonstrates that the descriptive time-sampling method can provide useful information about individuals, and also has significance in our understanding of schizophrenia, in that it exemplifies in detail the everyday distortions of inner experience in schizophrenia.\r"

Intra-cystic haemorrhage, masking the presence of an arachnoid cyst on computed tomography (CT) is highlighted. Repeat of CT scanning in young patients with subdural haematomas in the absence of severe trauma is recommended. Two theories are proposed to account for the observed susceptibility to the development of subdural haematomas in these patients.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging has made the anatomical localisation of intramedullary spinal lesions more exact and probably more specific than previous methods of investigation. Syrinx length, diameters, cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios have been studied in 12 patients with syringomyelia to assess whether the dimensions of the syrinx relate to the clinical findings. The length of syrinx appeared to be related to cyst diameter, cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios. Patients with a small syrinx tended to have a small cyst diameter, and small cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios. No significant relationship was found between muscle wasting or weakness, distribution of sensory loss, degree of disability or distress and the dimensions of the syrinx. These findings should be borne in mind when surgical management is being considered.\r"

  ".U": "88010045\r", 
  ".W": "Conventional vestibular rotation testing with the head centered on the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0.1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with head centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with head eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with head eccentric in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with head eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus with respect to the gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses with head eccentric. We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with dystrophia myotonica were investigated using neurophysiological combined with histochemical techniques to elucidate motor unit properties in foot extensor muscles, which are often involved in the early stages of this disorder. For the 25 extensor digitorum brevis motor units studied the axonal conduction velocity, the axonal refractory period and the voluntary firing properties were within normal limits. However, high threshold motor units were not observed and the mean value of the axonal conduction velocities was lower (p less than 0.02) for the dystrophia myotonica motor units when compared with corresponding data from healthy subjects. There were also signs of impaired impulse propagation in the terminal part of the motor unit. In muscle biopsy specimens from the anterior tibial muscle, fibre type composition and structure were demonstrated using enzyme histochemical techniques for adenosine-triphosphate and immunohistochemical techniques for identification of the types of myosin isoform present. The histochemical findings indicated a type I fibre dominance, which was most obvious in the more seriously affected muscles. Neonatal myosin was observed preferentially in small but also in some normal sized fibres. Furthermore, some ring fibres were present and these showed staining with antineonatal myosin in their superficial portion. This indicates that an abnormal regeneration is one cause of the myopathic appearance of the muscle fibres in dystrophia myotonica. These investigations show that there is a reduced proportion of type II motor units in foot extensor muscles involved in the myopathy in dystrophia myotonica although it cannot definitely be established whether this is due to a loss of high threshold type II motor units or type II to type I transformation.\r"
