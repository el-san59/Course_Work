Not surprisingly, then, many professionals believe this type of research is less rigorous and less useful than experimental research. Contrary to this belief, the planning and decision making involved in survey research is as technical as that of other types of research. Ten practical principles for survey research are presented. These principles describe the major issues researchers should address in planning and conducting a questionnaire survey study.\r"

This instrument was developed for use in primary care research. We have tested its value in a primary care setting among individuals with suspected increased risk of health problems. In a group of 65 white adults with high life changes and weak social supports, this scale produced relatively stable functional status scores over fifteen months. In addition, functional status scores derived from this instrument were strongly correlated with cumulative six-month self-reported morbidity. These findings suggest that the Duke-UNC Health Profile is an acceptably reliable and valid measure of health status for adults with high psychosocial risk of health impairment.\r"

Only patients in a continuity relationship (minimum 5 visits) were studied. Utilizing a previously validated Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ), the dimensions of access, availability, continuity, finances, physician humaneness, and physician quality/competence were measured. Although there was little discriminant power between the measures of physician humaneness and quality/competence of care, overall internal validity was high. Availability and finances created the most dissatisfaction. Residents' care was reported to be as satisfying as that delivered by faculty physicians. Differentiation between system dependent factors and physician-dependent factors may be difficult among patients with a demonstrated continuity relationship. Nevertheless this study demonstrated a high internal validity for the short form of the PSQ in yet another practice setting. This instrument is available for further investigation in clinical settings.\r"

Of these, 233 (31 percent of all patients with acute myocardial infarction) were judged to be suitable streptokinase candidates by virtue of being 75 years of age or younger, showing evidence of acute transmural infarction, having no contraindications to anticoagulation, and presenting to the Emergency Room within six hours or less after onset of chest pain. It is concluded that approximately one-third of all acute myocardial infarction patients in this population were eligible for streptokinase thrombolysis and that there is therefore a significant continuing role for traditional acute myocardial infarction management.\r"

Of the 30 participants in the study, 16 had a history of knee injury or surgery. All participants performed randomly ordered trials of the SLR and QS exercises while the EMG data were recorded from surface electrodes and normalized to values derived from maximal effort isometric contraction trials. An analysis of variance demonstrated significantly greater activity (p less than .05) of the vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius muscles during QS exercises than during SLR exercises. The rectus femoris muscle was significantly more active (p less than .05) during SLR exercises than during QS exercises. The study demonstrated remarkably different degrees of muscle activation between the SLR and QS exercises, indicating that the exercise selected will affect the therapeutic intention.\r"

Cardiac output changed linearly (cardiac output = 0.3 X height -0.99 liter/min), and cardiac index was validated as a means for standardizing cardiac output in infants younger than 10 to 13 months of age. Infants younger than 2 months had lower cardiac indexes and stroke volume indexes (2.6 +/- 0.7 liters/min/m2 and 19 +/- 5 ml/m2, respectively) compared with those aged 12 months (3.2 +/- 0.7 liter/min/m2 and 25 +/- 5 ml/m2, respectively).

  ".U": "88053262\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the quantitative influence of carefully controlled alterations in end-diastolic volume and afterload resistance on multiple simultaneously determined ejection and isovolumetric phase indexes of left ventricular contractile function in 23 isolated supported canine ventricles. The influence of load change on each index was compared with its sensitivity to inotropic stimulation, and this sensitivity was in turn contrasted to the response of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR). Experimental data demonstrated various degrees of load sensitivity among the indexes, with a generally curvilinear relationship between load and index response for both preload and afterload alterations. The curvilinear nature of these relationships meant that over a select range of loading, many indexes demonstrated relative load independence. They also often displayed greater sensitivity to inotropic change than the ESPVR, and both factors help explain their enduring clinical utility. To further explore the influence of load and contractile state on several of the indexes, we developed a theoretical analysis, using variables common to pressure-volume relationships, in which these dependencies could be derived. The theoretical models fit very well with the experimental data, and reaffirmed the frequently curvilinear nature of the relationships. We conclude that while many clinical indexes of ventricular contractile function show significant load dependence, the information they provide can be reasonably interpreted within defined ranges of load and inotropic alteration. Any advantage of the ESPVR will derive not from the magnitude of its response to inotropic change, which is smaller than most other indexes, but from its relative insensitivity to load alteration over a wider range of load.\r"

The two resuscitation groups were subdivided into patients less than or equal to 3 years old and children greater than 3 years old. The children under 3 years old required significantly more fluid and sodium during the first 48 h when calculations were made using body weight as the indexing factor. When fluid and sodium needs of paediatric age groups were calculated using body surface area as the indexing factor, significant differences in fluid and sodium requirements were no longer present between age groups. This suggests that these observed differences may reflect the difference in surface area to mass ratio for these age groups. Children resuscitated with HLS require 23 per cent less fluid in the first 24 h. If body weight is used for estimating fluid needs, clinicians should be aware of the differences in fluid requirements for children less than or equal to 3 years old compared with older paediatric patients. Formulas for estimating fluid needs are presented.\r"

Split thickness skin samples were obtained from several pigs using an air-powered dermatome. Alternate segments of these skin slices were processed for skin water content determination and for histopathologic measurements of skin thickness. Tissue samples were weighed, dried and subsequently weighed again using standardized methods to determine tissue water content. In some instances the volume of tissue was also determined to allow the calculation of tissue density. Given a table of measured values of water content as a function of skin thickness, a least-squares cubic polynomial was fitted to the data and water content as a function of depth was computed from the following formula: w(T-d) = T/d x (WT-WT-d)+WT-d where T is the total thickness of a skin slice, WT is the fraction of water computed from the cubic equation, d is the thickness of the skin slice at a depth T-d, and WT-d is the fraction of water above the thin slice. Stratum corneum hydration was calculated from measured ambient relative humidity based on a relationship previously described by Rushmer et al. (1966). Skin thermal properties as a function of depth were calculated using the formulation of Cooper and Trezek (1971).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Factor analysis showed that four factors could explain 60% of the overall variance in responses. Analysis of variance using these four request categories (Psychosocial, Medical Explanation, Supportive Communication, Test Results/Reassurance) as dependent variables indicated significant differences in the requests of patients from various socio-economic backgrounds. Individuals who were single, divorced, Medicaid users, or recipients of free health-care service requested more psychosocial assistance than others.

First, the six components of adult learning theory studied were independent of one another, suggesting a lack of consistent attitudes toward these components. Second, faculty who had taken teaching courses or workshops on teaching showed attitudes different than their peers, and used different types of teaching activities. This finding suggests that educational experiences can in fact affect the attitudes and teaching practices used by medical faculty, at least with respect to principles of adult learning theory.\r"

This pilot study evaluates a systematic approach to identifying and reducing medication-related problems in a population averaging five chronic medical problems and taking an average of eleven medications. The approach is unique in its use of an in-depth home medication history and a comprehensive review of therapy. In spite of close medical supervision, an average of ten potentially medication-related problems were identified among seventeen therapeutically complex patients. Recommendations to eliminate these problems were developed by pharmacists who reviewed the patient information. These recommendations were presented to the patient's physician who accepted 67% of the suggestions.\r"

In this study we examine whether the outcome of treatment for chronic pain in a pain clinic exerts a significant effect on the eventual social functioning. The findings indicate that a more favorable outcome is associated with increased marital satisfaction, a heightened desire for sex, and an increased desire and ability for recreational activities. These findings have implications for family practitioners as they assess social functioning after treatment for chronic pain.\r"

Three groups of patients were studied: 144 family practice patients who had not visited an urgent care center; 220 family practice patients who had visited one of three urgent care centers; and 180 other urgent care center patients. The findings suggest that people do have varying perceptions of urgency for the same symptoms and that physicians might benefit from considering this when scheduling hours. The analysis also shows a discrepancy among patients as to problems they perceive as appropriate for urgent care centers. The results can be used to provide a profile of patients who are using urgent care centers and to show how family practice physicians can better accommodate patients who might seek medical care elsewhere.\r"

Eighty-four percent of participants offered house calls, averaging 2.68 house calls per physician over the two week study period. Most house calls were to the elderly or homebound for management purposes. Physicians thought house calls were important, but often an inefficient use of their time. Financial and time constraints were the most commonly cited limiting factors. The decision to make a house call is based on clinical judgment regarding the individual case and broader issues involving the physician's whole practice. Unless external constraints change, house calls will continue to be an uncommon event.\r"

Ten months after the course 33 (63.4%) were using the flexible sigmoidoscope; four additional respondents were expecting to begin using the instrument. Twenty three of these (69.7%) had only attended the course without additional training. Those who found the instrument more difficult to use, or decided immediately after the course that more education was necessary, were less likely to use the instrument. Those not using the instrument also were older, more likely to be in solo practice and more likely to be surgeons. The course altered the educational plans of 23.1% of the respondents. This one-day format combining didactic and laboratory work with the instrument proved to be an efficient and effective means of education for using the instrument.\r"

Results indicated that residents acquired information-gathering skills, but remained deficient in incorporating data into assessment and treatment. Implications for training are discussed, with the conclusion that a collaborative effort between behavioral science faculty and family physician faculty, including an emphasis on direct observation and supervision, appears to be the most promising approach to training family practice residents in behavioral science.\r"

In all age groups, the percentages of clear liquid treatments prescribed by physicians with pediatric training were higher than the percentages prescribed by physicians without pediatric training (NPT). The opposite pattern was shown for prescribed milk and drug treatments. Treatments other than clear liquid can be ineffective or dangerous, especially to children less than 1. More information about treatment of children with vomiting may be needed by all physicians, particularly those without pediatric training.\r"

The following year the same patient suffered an apparent reinfection, once again realizing prompt and total recovery upon receiving erythromycin therapy. Although not commonly reported, the possibility of reinfection with the Legionella bacterium is a reality. The source of human innoculation need not necessarily be a common water supply or large cooling system reservoir (as was previously thought). Erythromycin continues to be widely regarded as the treatment of choice for infections with the Legionella bacterium even though this case demonstrates that it does not prevent reinfection.\r"

There was no significant difference in the rate of enrollment for care in the Family Practice Clinic among the three groups (power = .95). Demographic data suggested that older soldiers who had higher military rank, smaller families, and those who had received care from a family physician in the past were more likely to enroll in family practice. The study demonstrated that the attitudes and knowledge of enrollees and non-enrollees toward the clinical skills of a family physician were similar. A study like this is relatively easy to perform and can be very useful market research for an individual practice.\r"

Fifty-eight percent of women experiencing symptoms took medication for their symptoms, with over-the-counter medication being the most frequent treatment. Only 14% of the total sample had discussed these symptoms with their physician. Sixty-nine percent of the sample believed they had premenstrual syndrome (PMS). There was a significant relationship between women's belief that they had PMS and the degree of incapacitation experienced from their symptoms.\r"

However, many of these previous studies have been conducted in obstetric clinics; relatively little research in this area has been done in a family practice setting. The first objective of this study was to note the prevalence of depressive symptomatology in a family practice clinic's pregnant patients. The second purpose was to evaluate the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptomatology during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Each subject (n = 27) was given a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at three times: second trimester, third trimester, and three weeks postpartum. Each subject also completed a life events scale for obstetric patients after delivery; both weighted and unweighted life events scores were calculated. The correlation between the weighted and unweighted life events scores was 0.85. Postpartum BDI scores were significantly related to life events scores: 0.47 (n = 27, p = .0133) for unweighted scores and 0.58 (n = 27, p = .0015) for weighted scores. Weighted life events scores were more highly correlated with BDI scores at each of the three administration. Finally, 19% of these subjects showed BDI scores consistent with mild depression after delivery. Each of these results is consistent with findings from studies done in other settings.\r"

Parental perception of urgency may be one factor that influences utilization of pediatric emergency services, yet little is understood about factors influencing this perception. The goal of this study was to determine if the perception of urgency is a critical factor in the decision of a parent to seek care in an emergency room, if demographic and access factors influence parental perception of urgency, and whether there is agreement of urgency rating by parent and physician. One hundred and one parents were interviewed to determine background demographic and access factors and perception of urgency. Physician and parental urgency was evaluated on a 5 level scale. Chi-square analysis was used to determine association between demographic and access factors and parental urgency ratings. Pearson product moment correlation was used to determine agreement between parent and physician urgency ratings. The majority of visits were acknowledged by both parents and physicians to be non-emergent. Fourteen (13.9%) and 10 (9.9%) of parents and physicians rated the visits as emergent (levels 1 and 2) while 65 (64.4%) parents and 76 (75.3%) physicians rated the visits as nonemergent.

Patients who reported common symptoms such as blackouts, tremors, temper outbursts, chest pain, unsteadiness, loss of appetite, vomiting, sadness and \"stomach pain\" had significantly higher rates of alcoholism than those who did not report these symptoms.

The mean duration of telephone calls was 4.6 minutes. Residents talked three times longer than the caller. History taking completeness was highly correlated with telephone call duration and particularly with time spent talking by the caller. Significant questions, such as asking about hydration status, were frequently omitted. Most questions were closed (84 percent). Time spent talking by the caller was longer, and more listener feedback was given, with year 1 than with year 3 residents.\r"

  ".W": "Fatigue is one of the 10 most common reasons for visiting a physician. Yet little is known about its course or impact, from the patient's perspective, on quality of life or utilization of medical care. The Dartmouth COOP Project, a primary care research network, conducted a one-year prospective study comparing chief complaint fatigue (CCF) patients with two age/sex matched comparison groups (N = 243). Results show that almost 67% of the CCF patients improved over one year; however, they had much higher utilization rates and substantial limitations in physical and emotional function. Fatigue was associated with physical symptoms and interference with many aspects of daily life. We conclude that fatigue has a powerful, adverse effect on quality of life. We hope the findings may help physicians to better understand and treat patients who seek care for fatigue.\r"

Most practitioners' attitudes reflect published American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines regarding using commercial formula for bottle-feeding babies rather than evaporated milk-based formulations. Ninety-two per cent agreed with recommendations relating to the need for fluoride supplementation when fluoride was unavailable in the water supply and 93% agreed that whole cow's milk was inappropriate in the infant's first year. Another 68% felt similarly about evaporated milk formulas. However, 32% of board certified and 53% of nonboard certified physicians continue to believe that early solid foods will reduce night waking. In 80% of the cases, practice recommendations disagreed with AAP guidelines by prescribing vitamin supplements for bottle-feeding babies receiving proprietary infant formulas. Additionally, two-thirds of the practitioners recommended unnecessary water complements and 62% suggested formula supplementation for breastfeeding babies. Solid foods and whole cow's milk for both breastfeeding and bottle-feeding babies often were recommended earlier than the second half of the first year.\r"

Patients were also asked whether they understood, agreed with, and changed any of their dietary practices as a result of the consultation. Responses are examined in light of the self-reported physical condition of the patient. Patients without nutrition-related conditions were just as likely to be asked about their eating habits as patients with nutrition-related conditions. Patients with nutrition-related conditions were far more likely to report being asked to change their practices than patients with no nutrition-related conditions (p less than .001). However, self-reported change in dietary practices as a result of physician counseling did not vary by nutrition related condition.\r"

We studied the impact of prior depression history and symptomatology on diagnosis and use of antidepressant therapy. Office visits made by 67 women diagnosed as depressed were coded for vegetative, psychological, and somatic depression-related symptoms. One third of patients diagnosed within the study period had a prior history of depression. Depressed mood and sleep disturbance were the most common symptoms on the diagnostic visit, although symptoms were heterogeneous. Most patients presented with a combination of vegetative, psychological, and/or somatic symptoms. Medication use was associated with prior history and with vegetative symptoms. Further research is needed to compare symptom presentation in recognized depressed patients to patients in whom depression is unrecognized by physicians, and to discriminate patient presentation from interview-elicited data.\r"

Rank orders of diagnoses using a Spearman's rho comparison of ranks were significantly correlated with national data as were most student-to-group comparisons. Students tended to see more patients of their own age group, and female students tended to see more female patients of child bearing age. Students with preceptors in the university setting saw patients who were older than those patients seen by students in nonuniversity preceptorship settings. Students in the university setting also saw fewer patients and performed fewer procedures during the three week preceptorship but had a higher level of participation in patient care. Females reported a lower level of participation in patient care than male students, and students who subsequently went into family practice residencies reported a higher level of participation than those students who entered other specialties.\r"

One third of all tests were judged excessive. Of multiple demographic and clinical variables studied, only patient age and severity were related to test ordering behavior. Six months after an administrative change caused by review of these findings, a repeat audit of sixty patient records revealed significantly fewer tests ordered (p less than .05) and significantly fewer excessive tests (p less than .05). The projected annual savings in laboratory charges for these patients were $14,838. Simple distribution of the base-year findings, by assisting a change in policy, have effected substantial reductions in excessive laboratory testing.\r"

Valid arguments can be made for both direct and inverse relationships. We analyzed data from a survey of Missouri family physicians using hypothetical cases to test for significant relationships between resource utilization, access to referral, and use of referral. No significant association between these variables was found using Pearson correlation coefficients. To determine whether physician characteristics other than utilization could explain referral behavior, multiple and logistic regressions were used with several physician personal and professional background factors as independent variables. No dominant factor emerged to explain differences in referral use by physicians. We conclude that the decision to initiate the referral process is complex and not easily explained, even with the aid of sophisticated statistical techniques.\r"

Encounter data were collected before and after the resident education phase and a follow-up phone call was made to patients to obtain information on their current health. Cost measures included 1) physician's fee, 2) laboratory fees and 3) total ambulatory costs. Costs were lowered only in the both-educated group for laboratory costs. It was not sufficient to educate only residents, the group generally targeted for education about cost. This finding suggests that the most effective educational programs may involve patients as well as physicians.\r"

Though there was a substantial drop in residents' utilization between their first and second year, the drop was not significant. While most residents reduced their test utilization as they progressed through residency, several who were extremely low utilization in there first year of training actually increase test utilization in the second year. There was substantial variation in residents' test utilization, most marked in the first year but persisting for all three years. Although test utilization progressively fell through the three years of training, the residents who were high utilizers during their first year of training remained high utilizers for the remainder of their training. Though the variation in resident test utilization apparent in PGYI was maintained throughout residency, the degree of variation was reduced and greater uniformity was achieved as training progressed.\r"

It is postulated that complement activation and glomerulonephritis in staphylococcal endocarditis may be the direct result of a bacterial product.

Both groups were identified by family screening using serum calcitonin determinations before and after pentagastrin stimulation. Pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism were associated both with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a and some cases of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma was invariably associated with C-cell hyperplasia, but C-cell hyperplasia was also associated with some sporadic tumours. All tumours were positive for calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (by immunohistological staining) (CEA) and most tumours stained for somatostatin. C-cell hyperplasia also stained for calcitonin, CEA and somatostatin. We conclude that sporadic and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma cannot always be discriminated by clinical or immunohistological methods. Family screening is essential in the diagnosis of hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma.\r"

No patient had progressive renal stone or parathyroid bone disease. Hypertension was defined as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than one standard deviation from the age-sex mean, or if hypotensive drugs were required. Thirty-nine per cent were hypertensive at presentation and 42 per cent became hypertensive later. Four patients died from causes unrelated to hypercalcaemia and three required parathyroidectomy when serum calcium concentration rose above 3.0 mmol/l. Patients over 55 with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism may be managed conservatively for several years without significant renal impairment, progressive stone disease, parathyroid bone disease or worsening hypercalcaemia. We suggest that observation in these patients could be restricted to six-monthly checks of physical state, blood pressure and serum biochemistry, particularly concentration of calcium creatinine and alkaline phosphatase.\r"

Twenty-three received desferrioxamine because of aluminum-related bone disease, and 16 because of iron overload. A control group of 193 patients on maintenance hemodialysis but without desferrioxamine was used. No difference was found in the incidence of septicemia or of all bacterial infections between the patients with aluminum-related bone disease treated with desferrioxamine and the control patients (0.12 vs. 0.12 septicemia per patient-therapy-year, p greater than 0.05; 0.23 vs. 0.26 bacterial infections per patient-therapy-year, p greater than 0.05). The incidence of septicemia in patients treated with desferrioxamine for iron overload, however, was almost three times that in the control patients (0.36 vs. 0.12 septicemia per patient-therapy-year, p less than 0.01). To assess the effect of iron overload itself, we determined the frequency of bacterial infection in patients on regular hemodialysis who have never received desferrioxamine. These were subdivided into three groups according to serum ferritin level which indicated normal or low iron stores (Group I: serum ferritin 10-330 micrograms/l, n = 125), moderate (Group II: serum ferritin 331-1000 micrograms/l, n = 49) or more advanced iron overload (Group III: serum ferritin 1001-2000 micrograms/l, n = 10). Compared to patients with normal or low serum ferritin levels (Group I), we found a significantly higher rate of bacterial infection among patients in Group II compared with Group I (0.18 vs. 0.34 infections per patient-therapy-year, p less than 0.05) and Group III compared with Group I (0.18 vs. 0.58 infections per patient-therapy-year, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that treatment with desferrioxamine does not favour the development of septicemia or bacterial infection independently of iron overload and that iron overload itself may predispose patients on regular hemodialysis to bacterial infection.\r"

As indicators of fibrinolysis and coagulation, plasmin and thrombin activity were assessed by assay of the fibrinogen peptide derivatives B beta 15-42 and fibrinopeptide A respectively in 60 diabetic patients and 50 control subjects in a cross-sectional study. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) correlated with B beta 15-42 (r = -0.26, p less than 0.05) and fibrinopeptide A (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05) in the diabetic patients suggesting that poor glycaemic control (i.e. high HbA1 levels) was associated with depressed plasmin and enhanced thrombin activity. Compared to controls, fibrinopeptide A levels were increased in diabetics (p less than 0.001) irrespective of sex or type of diabetes. B beta 15-42 levels were normal in diabetic females but increased in diabetic men (p less than 0.001) possibly secondary to the activation of coagulation. These results suggest that in diabetes mellitus activation of coagulation is the dominant haemostatic abnormality and that better glycaemic control could influence in-vivo plasmin and thrombin activity favourably.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether detailed interpretation of rectal histology can enable this distinction to be made early in the course of the illness. Seventy-two rectal biopsies, taken at the time of presentation from patients with undiagnosed colitis, were reviewed independently by two observers without access to clinical information. Distorted crypt architecture, crypt atrophy, basal lymphoid aggregates and dense lymphocytic infiltrates each emerged as features with a 76 to 86 per cent probability of predicting idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, but their discriminant value was limited by inter-observer disagreement (16-29 per cent). Isolated basal giant cells, epithelial surface erosions and epithelioid granulomas were found to be the most reliable histological features in the early diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, and their interpretation was associated with the lowest inter-observer disagreement (6 per cent).\r"

  ".W": "The role of fine needle aspiration cytology was examined in a series of 115 euthyroid patients referred with thyroid enlargement presenting consecutively to a joint medical and surgical thyroid clinic from April 1985 to December 1986. Needle aspiration was performed at first clinic attendance and repeated two to six months later in 39 subjects. Patients were classified according to cytological features of the thyroid aspirate. A diagnosis of benign colloid goitre was made in 59 patients, lymphocytic thyroiditis in 11, thyroid cyst in 32 and in addition there were 13 reports of suspicious or malignant cytological features. Malignancy was confirmed histologically in six patients in this group and five more had follicular adenomata. There were two false positive reports of 'suspicious' cytological features. During a median period of observation of 11.4 months one false negative cytological diagnosis has emerged in a further patient with follicular adenoma. Accuracy in the diagnosis of thyroid neoplasia of 97 per cent has thus been achieved. Fine needle aspiration cytology has replaced isotope and ultrasound scanning in our practice. The number of 99mTc scans performed in the investigation of goitre fell from 77 in 1984 to three in 1986. Neoplastic tissue was removed at operation in 40 per cent of cases proceeding to surgery (20 subjects), compared with a predicted rate of 9.6 per cent if all solitary nodules had been removed. Aspiration cytology performed at first clinic attendance has led to improved selection of patients for surgery and hence economy in their management.\r"

  ".W": "In a rat model (BNML) for human acute myelocytic leukemia the distribution of leukemic cells in bone marrow samples from various sites was investigated, using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and flow cytometry. Rats were studied before chemotherapy as well as thereafter, ie, in the \"minimal residual disease\" (MRD) phase. Bone marrow from different types of bones was analyzed from each animal. Before treatment, the ratio of the measured extreme values (ie, highest/lowest value) for leukemic cell frequencies in bones from individual rats ranged from 3.7 to 11.7. During the MRD phase the ratios of the extremes ranged from a factor of 36 to more than 13,000 from one rat to another. The variability between bones of comparable size was estimated by studying the ribs from each individual animal. Within individuals the extremes differed by a factor of 1.2 to 4.0 before chemotherapy and from 2.4 to greater than 320 after chemotherapy. The variability within the marrow cavity of a single bone was determined by analyzing multiple samples from femoral bones cut into slices. The leukemic cell frequency appeared to vary considerably, ie, before treatment from 1.7 to 7.3 and during MRD from 4 to 28,000. The presented data may contribute to understanding the sometimes conflicting observations in leukemic patients. Improvement of methods for detecting MRD will not automatically lead to a more accurate estimation of the total tumor burden. The reliability of diagnoses based on the analysis of single bone marrow aspirates appears to be highly questionable.\r"

Blast cells obtained from both initial diagnosis and relapse were immunophenotyped using a variety of monoclonal antibodies; simultaneously we hybridized Southern blots of respective cell samples to immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chain as well as to T-cell receptor beta-chain (T beta) sequences. While similar phenotypes were observed in both states of nine cases, comparison of Ig gene rearrangements revealed clonal variations, ie, appearance of an evoluted or novel leukemic cell clone in relapse beside identical leukemic populations in both states. One pre-T (ALL) patient, presenting with germline configuration of T beta gene sequences at diagnosis, exhibited a rearrangement of T beta gene sequences in recurrent disease. Another patient displayed T-ALL phenotype and T beta gene rearrangement at diagnosis but relapsed with a very immature phenotype and germline configuration for T beta sequences. Our results emphasize the value of molecular analyses in order to unravel the nature of leukemic relapse.\r"

  ".W": "The initiation and maintenance of cellular differentiation for a variety of cell types has been shown to be influenced by the microenvironment. To investigate the influence of bone marrow stroma on leukemic cell differentiation, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were grown in the presence of Triton-treated extracellular matrix derived from normal human bone marrow stromal cells. This bone marrow matrix microenvironment had a dramatic impact on the phenotypic expression of this malignant line. HL-60 cellular proliferation, morphology, nonspecific esterase activity, formation of Fc rosettes, and sensitivity to induction by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were all influenced by the presence of matrix molecules. In contrast, stromal cell-conditioned media did not alter HL-60 phenotype. Thus, HL-60 cells appear to retain responsiveness to a human bone marrow stromal cell-derived matrix despite their ability to grow autonomously. Studies of the interaction of leukemic cells and marrow stroma in vitro may provide important information concerning the regulation of leukemic cell behavior.\r"

However, following an analysis of clinical and hematological findings in leukemia occurring in irradiated cervical cancer patients, adult Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, and spondylitics treated with x-ray, striking differences were noted. Acute leukemias in cervical cancer patients and Japanese survivors were similar in type to acute de novo leukemias in adults. Cell types among spondylitics were very dissimilar; rare forms, eg, acute erythromyelocytic leukemia (AEL) and acute megakaryocytic leukemia, were increased. Pancytopenia occurred in 25 of 35 cases and erythromyelodysplastic disorders were noted in seven of 35 acute cases. The leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders closely resembled those occurring in patients treated with alkylating agents. This similarity suggests a common pathogenesis involving marrow stem cell injury and extra-medullary mediators of hematopoiesis. Investigation of early acute leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders with newer techniques may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of leukemia in humans.\r"

We have isolated a cDNA probe for lactoferrin and used it to study the synthesis of lactoferrin mRNA by normal and leukemic granulocyte precursors. The probe pHL-41 has been subcloned in phage m13 and characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleic acid sequencing. pHL-41 contains approximately 40% of the coding sequence of the lactoferrin gene. The 3' untranslated region includes a stop codon and a possible polyadenylation signal. There is a greater than 98% agreement between the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence and that determined by analysis of the protein. Myeloid cells from normal bone marrow and circulating leukocytes from patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia contain lactoferrin mRNA transcripts that are indistinguishable in size and relative quantity. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 contains no lactoferrin mRNA. Induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation fails to induce the synthesis of detectable lactoferrin message. Similarly, studies with the human myeloblastic leukemia cell line PLB-985 reveal the inability of these cells to produce lactoferrin mRNA even under conditions that bring about morphologically demonstrable granulocytic differentiation. These data suggest that granulocytic differentiation in the leukemic cell lines is incomplete or defective. The presence of lactoferrin may play a role in the orderly expression of the genetic program leading to the development of the normal mature granulocyte.\r"

Course 2 was given starting on day 24 with the addition of cyclophosphamide 1 g/22. Overall nine patients achieved complete remission (30%) and three attained a partial remission (10%), for an overall response rate of 40%. Four patients expired during induction whereas 14 had resistant disease. Response rate was significantly higher for patients with lymphoid compared to undifferentiated morphology (55% versus 10%; P = 0.05). In lymphoid blast crisis, Calla-positive disease was associated with a higher response rate compared to Calla-negative disease (75% versus 25%; P = 0.08). Eleven patients developed infections, and seven had fever without documented infections. The median overall survival was 29 weeks. Median survival was 43 weeks for patients achieving complete remission and 20 weeks for those with resistant disease. Remission duration was 39 weeks. After primary and salvage therapy, nine patients are alive, six of them in continuous remission for 19+ to 112+ weeks. The authors conclude that VAD chemotherapy is an effective regimen with acceptable toxicity in patients with lymphoid blast crisis especially those with Calla-positive disease. Alternate induction regimens for undifferentiated disease and for maintenance therapy are currently being investigated.\r"

On this latter agent, a dramatic response has been noted with a decrease in the pulmonary symptoms, and a marked reduction in the size of the lymph nodes and lung nodules. The authors report this case because it represents a rare presentation of an uncommon disease and because of the striking improvement that followed the initiation of a novel therapeutic modality.\r"

The damage due to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion increases with age; therefore, one would expect to find more xanthine oxidase in adult than in young hearts. Consequently, we studied the age-dependence of xanthine oxidoreductase activity in hearts, in addition to the localization of the enzyme in cultured rat-heart cells. We measured xanthine oxidase plus dehydrogenase activity in homogenates of hearts and in homogenates of cultured neonatal myocytes and nonmuscular cells. In rat heart homogenates, xanthine oxidoreductase increased from 0.5 +/- 0.1 mU/g wet wt (newborn, mean +/- SD) to 25 +/- 4 mU/g (age 15 weeks, p less than 0.001). The value for adult rabbit heart was more than 1,000 times lower and hardly detectable. Therefore, we did not study young rabbit hearts. In rat myocyte cultures, xanthine oxidoreductase activity increased from 4.2 +/- 1.6 mU/g protein (2nd day of culture) to 17 +/- 4 mU/g (4th day, p less than 0.005). The activity in nonmuscular cells increased much more, from 10.1 +/- 1.1 to 117 +/- 25 mU/g (p less than 0.002). The age-related increase of xanthine oxidoreductase activity in rat heart is in agreement with the implied role in reperfusion damage by the enzyme. Whether myocytes, in which the enzyme has a low activity, could be damaged in this way, remains to be studied.\r"

Six healthy volunteers were given somatostatin analog intravenously at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/hr. At the same time, jejunal water and ion movement and transit time were measured using the triple-lumen tube technique [perfusion of a plasma-like electrolyte solution with PEG as a nonabsorbable marker at a rate of 15 ml/min; dye dilution curves ([3H]mannitol, [14C]PEG, BSP) for determination of jejunal transit time]. During somatostatin analog administration, transit time through a 30-cm segment of perfused jejunum increased from 4.0 min to 17.0 min. While the somatostatin analog increased jejunal transit time, it had no effect on net water and electrolyte absorption under steady-state conditions. The effect of somatostatin analog on the proximal small bowel is similar to the action of an eight-times higher dose of intravenous native somatostatin previously studied. The effect of the analog on transit time suggests a potentially beneficial effect in patients with large-volume diarrhea in which no tumor or circulating secretagogue can be identified, such as in pseudopancreatic cholera syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Substance P (SP) and substance K (SK) are mammalian tachykinin peptides derived from a single preprotachykinin-A (PPT-A) gene and are widely but selectively distributed in neural and endocrine tissues. SP is present in the rat anterior pituitary, and its content there varies with the thyroid status of the animal. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the PPT-A gene is expressed in the anterior pituitary and if so, whether PPT-A messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance is regulated by thyroid hormone status. Male rats were surgically or chemically thyroidectomized or made hyperthyroid by thyroid hormone (T3) injection. Total RNA was isolated from individual anterior pituitaries, and PPT-A mRNA abundance was determined by dot blot procedures. In parallel groups of rats, anterior pituitaries were extracted for measurement of SP and SK by specific RIAs. Surgical or chemical thyroidectomy increased PPT-A mRNA abundance 4 to 6-fold and increased both SP and SK content in the anterior pituitary. Administration of T3 to thyroidectomized rats reversed the increase in both PPT-A mRNA abundance and SP and SK content in the adenohypophysis. T3 administration to euthyroid rats also decreased PPT-A mRNA abundance and SP and SK content in the anterior pituitary. The coordinate presence of PPT-A mRNA with SP and SK in the anterior pituitary strongly suggests that these peptides are synthesized within this gland.\r"

Immature diethylstilbestrol-primed rats were treated for 3 days prior to sacrifice with or without FSH. Their ovaries were either fixed in formaldehyde for immunohistochemistry or the RNA was extracted for northern blot analysis. Hybridization with a rat TGF-alpha cDNA probe revealed a 4.5 kilobase mRNA whose abundance was markedly stimulated in the rats treated with FSH. Immunohistochemical staining, using a sequence specific monoclonal antibody to TGF-alpha, MF9, detected immunoreactive TGF-alpha only in the interstitial and theca cells. FSH treatment resulted in no appreciable change in the immunostaining. These results suggest that TGF-alpha is synthesized in the ovary, perhaps in the theca-interstitial compartment.\r"

O2 consumption decreased by 15% on the 1st day of fasting and then by an additional 15% on the 2nd day. On the 3rd day, when rats were fed again, energy intake increased by 30% above control (prefasting) values, whereas energy expenditure rapidly increased but no more than control values. On the other hand, when ad libitum fed animals were offered a sucrose solution (32%) for 2 days, energy intake increased by 30% and energy expenditure by 9-12%. On the 3rd day, when the rats were fed with their normal diet, energy intake significantly decreased under control (preoverfeeding) values during one day, but energy expenditure rapidly returned to normal values. The results show that fasting decreases, whereas hyperphagia increases 24-h energy expenditure during the treatments. When the treatments are terminated, energy expenditure rapidly returns to normal values, but fasting induces a postfasting increase of energy intake (during 2 days), whereas hyperphagia, on the contrary, results in a transient decrease of appetite. This indicates that alterations of food intake induce compensatory changes of energy expenditure during the treatments, but that after the treatments, energy balance is normalized via regulatory adjustments in the ratio of energy expenditure over energy intake.\r"

The remaining neurons did not show any responsiveness to PGE2. Moreover, we also examined the effects of PGE2 on the hypothalamic neurons both in normal Krebs-Ringer solution and synaptic blocking medium (low Ca2+, high Mg2+). Most of the neurons (12/15) retained their responsiveness to PGE2 in the synaptic blocking medium, indicating that PGE2 has a direct action on the hypothalamic neuron. Therefore, it is conceivable that neurons in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic region that respond to PGE2 might play an important role in the development of fever. However, characteristics of neurons responding to PGE2 were not determined based on their thermoresponsiveness.\r"

Genomic DNA from patients and normal subjects was digested with the restriction endonuclease Bg1 II, transferred to nylon membranes using the Southern blot technique, and hybridized with a TCR beta probe. A significant increase in the frequency of the 10.0; 9.2-kilobase heterozygous phenotype was found in GD (68.6%) vs. 42.1% in normal subjects (P = 0.003). Using the complex phenotype TCR homozygote (hetero) DR3 as a reference (odds ratio = 1.00), we found that the risk for Graves' disease was restricted to TCR beta heterozygote/DR3+ individuals (odds ratio = 8.31; chi 2 = 11.82; P = 0.0009); in the absence of TCR beta heterozygosity, DR3 was not significantly associated with the disease. These results suggest that TCR beta chain genes also are associated with susceptibility to GD and that the association is most pronounced in (or restricted to) those individuals who are HLA DR3 positive.\r"

  ".U": "88008209\r", 
  ".W": "Recent data are consistent with the presence of two 17 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (17 beta-HOR) activities in placental homogenates. One is localized to intracellular membrane fractions. The conversion of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to estrone (E1) by this enzyme can be completely inhibited in vitro by C19 and C21 steroids. The second activity is detected in microsomes, but is recovered principally in the cytosol. It also has 20 alpha-HOR activity, but has a high affinity only for C18 steroids. We used this difference to estimate the relative contributions of the two enzymes to E2, E1, and testosterone (T) metabolism by villous tissue in vitro. Fragments of tissue from vaginally delivered placentas (38-40 weeks) were incubated with [3H]E2, [3H]E1, or [3H]T as substrates and various unlabeled steroids as potential inhibitors. Approximately 40% of the E2 to E1 reaction was not inhibited by C19 steroids at 100-200 microM, whereas the conversion of T to androstenedione was inhibited by 90% or more under similar conditions. In contrast, the metabolizable C19 and C21 steroids, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, which inhibited the conversion of E1 to E2 by microsomes, stimulated E2 formation from E1 by villi. We conclude that nonspecific 17 beta-HOR accounts for approximately 60% of the E2 to E1 conversion and nearly all of the T to androstenedione conversion in villous tissue fragments. The data also suggest that net E2 formation in villi is catalyzed principally by the C18-specific 17 beta-HOR.\r"

  ".U": "88008218\r", 
  ".W": "Ten acromegalic patients, four previously untreated, were studied before and at regular intervals during treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (200-300 micrograms daily for 2 or 3 sc injections for 16-108 weeks). All patients had rapid clinical improvement, with disappearance of excessive perspiration, paresthesias, and headache within the first 6 weeks of therapy. The mean 24-h serum GH concentrations fell from 44.0 +/- 7.8 (+/-SE) micrograms/L before to 5.9 +/- 1.0 microgram/L at the end of therapy. The GH levels from 2-6 h after the acute administration of 50 micrograms SMS 201-995 before the start of therapy correlated significantly with the mean 24-h GH concentrations after 16-108 weeks of treatment (P less than 0.05). The initially increased serum somatomedin-C (Sm-C) levels normalized in 5 of these 10 patients; the mean values were 7.3 +/- 0.9 U/mL before and 2.9 +/- 0.7 U/mL at the end of therapy. The Sm-C and mean GH levels continuously decreased during long term therapy; the concentrations after 1.5-2 yr of therapy were significantly lower than those after 6-12 months of therapy (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.01, respectively). A slight decrease in the size of the pituitary tumor was noted by computed tomography in three of six patients. Transient clinically detectable steatorrhea occurred in two patients. Postprandial hyperglycemia occurred during therapy in eight patients, while in two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus carbohydrate tolerance improved in one and deteriorated in the other. SMS 201-995 is a highly effective medical treatment for acromegaly. Clinically improvement occurs rapidly, and the inhibition of serum GH and Sm-C levels persisted even after more than 1 yr of therapy. No important subjective side-effects were noted. SMS 201-995 is an excellent drug in patients in whom acromegaly persists after surgery and for interim treatment to shorten the period of clinical activity after irradiation.\r"

Two peptides with apparent molecular weights of 10,000 and 13,000 D were derived from hyperplastic tissue, whereas a single moiety of 10,000 D was obtained from malignant tissue. These entities increased cell numbers and alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastlike cells consistent with effects on both growth and differentiation. Prostatic peptides did not stimulate adenylate cyclase in osteosarcoma cells. Mitogenic activity selective for osteoblastlike cells was identified in postpubertal but not prepubertal normal prostate. The results demonstrate the existence of osteoblastic growth factors in prostatic tissue whose presence may accompany postpubertal development.\r"

The increases in [Ca+2]i reached a peak within 15-90 s, attained 50% of the maximum level at 1.2 nM LTD4 and 60 nM LTC4, were greater in maximal magnitude for LTD4 than LTC4, and subsided in 5-7 min. Flow cytometric evaluation of the LTD4-induced increases in [Ca+2]i, reflected in increases in the fluorescence of intracellular indo-1, revealed that a mean of 77% of differentiated HL-60 cells responded, as contrasted with lesser increases in only 50% of undifferentiated HL-60 cells. The capacity of pretreatment of HL-60 cells with LTD4 to prevent subsequent responses of [Ca+2]i to LTC4 and LTD4, and the finding that the serine-borate inhibitor of conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 suppressed concurrently both LTC4-induced rises in [Ca+2]i and increases in adherence to Sephadex G-25 indicated that the responses of HL-60 cells to LTC4 required conversion to LTD4. That pertussis toxin and a chemical antagonist of LTD4 reduced the [Ca+2]i response suggested a dependence on LTD4 receptors. The LTD4-induced increases in [Ca+2]i were dependent on extracellular calcium and diminished by lanthanum, but not affected by nifedipine nor associated with changes in membrane potential, as measured with the fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine. Thus, the increase in [Ca+2]i in HL-60 cells, which is coupled to an increase in adherence, appears to involve LTD4 receptor-specific and voltage-independent calcium channels in the plasma membrane.\r"

This assay can detect HIV RNA in 10(2) cultured lymphoblastoid cells infected with HIV; it only weakly crossreacts with the RNA of HTLV-I or HTLV-II. For 39 (80%) of 49 seropositive subjects, we detected HIV sequences in the RNA from 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, we could not detect HIV DNA in samples of DNA from the same number of cells from any of 39 seropositive individuals tested. Three of 33 seronegative individuals had false-positive results. Nevertheless, because we found an excellent correlation between results from our assay and culture of HIV from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seropositive subjects, it is unlikely that positive cultures of HIV from these cells reflect latent infection. Nucleic acid hybridization offers a more rapid, simple, and inexpensive alternative to culture for detecting HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\r"

  ".W": "The antitumor compound ACNU (1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitroso ure a hydrochloride) is widely used for treatment of malignant brain tumors. The authors have investigated the mechanism of acquisition of ACNU resistance at the cellular level by isolating ACNU-resistant mutants from V79 Chinese hamster cells and C6 rat glioma cells after treatment of the cells with ACNU or other alkylating agents. In V79 Chinese hamster cells, ACNU at 1 to 4 micrograms/ml caused dose-dependent induction of drug-resistant mutants to ACNU (10 micrograms/ml) and 8-azaguanine (20 micrograms/ml), but not to ouabain (1 mM). Values for the mean lethal dose of ACNU-resistant mutants were 2.4 to 17.2 times those of the parent V79 cells. The ACNU-resistant phenotype was stable during an observation period of 13 weeks. The ACNU seemed to have a specific effect in inducing ACNU-resistant mutations, because no ACNU-resistant mutations were induced by treatment of the cells with other known mutagens, such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, methylmethanesulfonate, and ethylmethanesulfonate. The C6 rat glioma cells also showed a significant mutagenic response to ACNU, producing ACNU- and 5-fluorouracil-resistant mutants. The present results have the important therapeutic and mechanistic implication that ACNU is a potent mutagen and induces mutants that are resistant to ACNU and to other drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the in vitro contractile responses of canine basilar artery to KCl, prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, and hemoglobin. Hypoxia was induced by changing the bubbling gas mixture in the chamber from 95% O2/5% CO2 to 95% N2/5% CO2. Hypoxia augmented the contractile response developed at 95% O2 to 25 mM and 50 mM KCl, 3 X 10(-7) M and 10(-5) M PGF2 alpha, and 10(-6) M hemoglobin. No significant alteration of the hypoxic augmentation in any preparation exposed to 25 mM KCl, 3 X 10(-7) M PGF2 alpha, or 10(-6) M hemoglobin was observed with guanethidine (10(-5) M), prazosin (10(-5) M), methysergide (10(-5) M), or diphenhydramine (10(-5) M). Endothelial denudation did not affect hypoxic augmentation. Hypoxia did not cause any alteration of the contractile response to 10(-6) M PGF2 alpha in Ca++-free media. Pretreatment with a calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, significantly inhibited the hypoxic potentiation of the contractile response to 25 mM KCl, 3 X 10(-7) M PGF2 alpha, and 10(-6) M hemoglobin. These results suggest that hypoxia augments the contractile response to these agonists by a direct action on the smooth-muscle cells, facilitating the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium. Hypoxia of smooth-muscle cells in the major cerebral arteries might be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm.\r"

Intravenous labetalol (1 mg/kg), acebutolol (0.25 mg/kg), lidocaine (2 mg/kg), and saline (1 ml), injected prior to anesthesia, were compared with respect to their effect on the hemodynamic consequences of direct laryngoscopy followed by the passage of an endotracheal tube. A pre-induction dose of labetalol was found to be more effective than acebutolol and lidocaine in attenuating the pressor response to instrumentation and intubation. Labetalol should prove most useful for those patients at risk from the transient hypertension and tachycardia following instrumentation and intubation.\r"

A cephalometric head-holder was designed to position the TMJ in an accurate and reproducible manner and multisection parasagittal images were obtained perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the condyle. MR images depicted anterior disc position in 32% of the asymptomatic joints (8/24 males, 5/18 females). Anterior disc position in asymptomatic subjects may be a predisposing factor to TMJ dysfunction or simply an anatomic variant whose prevalence must be considered when evaluating TMJ dysfunction.\r"

Using polyethylene tubes, the ointment was implanted subcutaneously in the pouches surgically created on the backs of the experimental group. Empty tube implants, tubes with the vehicle (vaseline/lanolin), and a sham operation (surgical pouches with no implant) served as controls. The animals were killed on day 14 and tissue blocks were taken containing the tubes and a generous amount of the peripheral connective tissue. The connective tissue surrounding the tube opening furthest from the surgical incision was histologically examined for the severity of tissue reaction (STR), the number of inflammatory cell infiltrates (II), and the spread of the reaction area (RSI). The data were statistically analyzed. The sham operation group showed minimal inflammatory response. All three parameters (STR, II, RSI) were significantly greater in the tetracycline group when compared with the empty tube group at 0.05 level of significance. There were significant differences between the mean values of the STR and RSI scores in the tetracycline and vehicle groups (groups 1 and 2). The vehicle group (group 2) had significantly higher STR and II values than the empty tube group (group 3); however, the RSI scores were not statistically different. Necrosis was observed in the reaction site in group 1 and vacuole-containing macrophages were noted in groups 1 and 2. This study, although an animal investigation, questions the use of topical 3% tetracycline ointment on sutured surgical flaps.\r"

No evidence for recombination was observed between the 5' end of met and previously described met markers. We present examples of the use of the met markers in the clinical diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and summarize our analysis of 29 clinical cases including eight prenatal diagnoses.

Exposure to the 5-HT autoreceptor antagonist methiothepin (0.1-1 microM) increased in a concentration-dependent manner the K+ stimulation-evoked overflow of [3H]-5-HT and a similar increase was observed under conditions of electrical stimulation. In contrast, exposure to the nontricyclic 5-HT uptake inhibitor citalopram (0.1-1 microM) did not modify by itself the electrically evoked overflow of [3H]-5-HT, but increased in a concentration-dependent manner the release of 3H-transmitter elicited by K+ stimulation. This effect of citalopram on transmitter release was potentiated when the endogenous stores of 5-HT were depleted by pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (300 mg/kg i.p.). Citalopram was shown previously to antagonize the inhibition by lysergic acid diethylamide of the electrically evoked release of [3H]-5-HT in rat hypothalamic slices. Yet, this inhibitor of neuronal uptake of 5-HT did not antagonize the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide when the release of [3H]-5-HT was evoked by K+ depolarization. Electrical stimulation represents a more physiological experimental model for transmitter release than exposure to high K+, and therefore the interaction between 5-HT uptake blockade and presynaptic inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptors, observed in the hypothalamus with electrical stimulation but not with K+ depolarization, remains of biological relevance.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of activated protein kinase C in vascular smooth muscle contraction, phorbol dibutyrate was used to stimulate this enzyme in order to evaluate the source(s) of Ca++ (10(-8) to 3 X 10(-6) M) elicited a concentration-dependent sustained contraction which was slow in onset but progressive in developed tension. The maximal contractile response induced by phorbol dibutyrate was only partly dependent on influx of extracellular Ca++ as shown by similar reductions (40%) produced by Ca++-free buffer, LaCl3 (1 mM) or nifedipine (10(-6) M). These data suggest that phorbol dibutyrate is able to open Ca++ channels which are sensitive to nifedipine blockade. However, unlike norepinephrine or K+-depolarization, phorbol dibutyrate evoked a slow 45Ca++ influx which occurred only after extended contact time. Pretreatment with nifedipine again abolished this response. In contrast to norepinephrine, phorbol dibutyrate did not cause 45Ca++ efflux indicating that intracellular Ca++ was not mobilized. It is concluded that the residual 60% contraction to phorbol dibutyrate most likely occurs via a mechanism independent of the Ca-calmodulin pathway.\r"

The results show that only 37.5 percent of all responding teaching hospitals specifically informed patients that students would be involved in care. Only 51 percent of the responding medical schools that specifically gave their students instruction or guidance on initial patient interaction as a matter of policy insisted that their students introduce themselves as students and clarify their role in patient care.

In addition, bladder tissue histamine content, urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion rates, and serum and urinary major basic protein levels were determined. A strong relationship among detrusor mast cell density, especially degranulated, and degree of epithelial loss, submucosal inflammation, epithelial ulceration, urinary pyuria and response to treatment was noted. Bladder tissue histamine content and urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion were increased in the interstitial cystitis patients. Eosinophil density in bladder biopsies was low uniformly, and interstitial cystitis and control patients showed no statistical difference. In addition, serum and urinary major basic protein levels were below the accepted normal lower limits for this protein. Therefore, our study demonstrates a relationship between the mast cell and the inflammatory process of interstitial cystitis. No similar relationship was noted for the eosinophil.\r"

The epitope recognized by LICR-LON-M18 is a prominent component of luminal plasma membranes of nonneoplastic resting and lactating human breast epithelial cells but is rarely expressed by human breast carcinomas. With the use of competitive binding-inhibition studies, the immunodominant portion of the LICR-LON-M18 epitope was shown to be the following oligosaccharide sequence [with galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)]: Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----. This structure was distinct from Gal beta 1----3GalNac, which was bound by peanut agglutinin (PNA) and was not recognized by LICR-LON-M18 [corrected]. With the use of biochemical techniques, the present data not only confirmed sialylation and consequent \"masking\" of the LICR-LON-M18 epitope and PNA determinants in human breast carcinomas but also identified the particular groups of glycoproteins involved in this process. These studies provided additional support for the thesis that sialylation of human breast carcinoma glycoproteins represented an enhancement of specific differentiation events normally regulated in the morphogenesis of nonneoplastic human breast epithelium and that specific glycoproteins became masked during the genesis of primary human breast cancer.\r"

On a log-log scale, incidence increased linearly between the ages 35 and 64, with a slope that was not different between males and females or among registries but that varied by histologic type. The estimated slopes were 0.4 for ependymomas, 1.0 for oligodendrogliomas, 1.7 for astrocytomas, 2.8 for meningiomas, and 3.9 for glioblastomas. The rate at which incidence increased with age was significantly higher for glioblastomas than for other glial tumors. This finding suggests a different mechanism of carcinogenesis for glioblastomas than for other glial tumors.\r"

This finding was obtained after accounting for disappearance data for tobacco (P less than .0001), the dominant risk factor for lung cancer, and total nonfat calories (P less than .002). Other covariates included per capita gross national product and proportion of calories from fruits, vegetables, roots, tubers, and pulses.

A personal interview was used to obtain lifetime occupational and smoking histories and self-reported history of exposures to specific agents. High-risk jobs were identified in advance of data analysis and linked with industrial and occupational codes for hypothesis testing. For females, lung cancer risk was not associated with employment history, but power was limited. For males, elevated risks were found for the uranium mining industry [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9; 95% confidence internal (CI) = 0.8-4.9], underground miners (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1-3.7), painters (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 0.8-8.9), and welders (OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.4-7.4).

HPV typing by DNA hybridization revealed HPV 6 and HPV 11 sequences in metaplastic squamous epithelia, CIN I, and CIN II, but not in CIN III lesions or invasive carcinomas. HPV 16 was detected in metaplastic epithelium and in nearly half of the invasive squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. It was present in 31% of CIN lesions, increasing in frequency with the severity of CIN from 20% of CIN I to 50% of CIN III. HPV 16 showed a striking difference in geographic distribution, being detected in 36% of the carcinomas from the United States compared to 64% of the carcinomas from Brazil and Peru. HPV 18 was found in metaplastic epithelia and in 17% of carcinomas but in only 1% of CIN lesions. HPV 31 was not found in metaplastic epithelium but was present in 6% of carcinomas and in 18% of CIN lesions. In addition, a group of uncharacterized HPVs, not corresponding to any of the probes used, was found in 5% of normal and metaplastic epithelia and in 18% of CIN and 19% of invasive cancers. These results suggest that individual HPV types that infect the cervix have varying degrees of oncogenic association. HPV 6 and HPV 11 appear to have very little oncogenic association, HPV 31 has low oncogenic association, and HPV 16 and HPV 18 have high oncogenic association.\r"

  ".U": "88012012\r", 
  ".W": "A randomized double-blind intervention trial was done in Huixian, People's Republic of China, a population with a high incidence of esophageal cancer. The aim of the trial was to determine whether a once-a-week treatment with retinol (15 mg or 50,000 IU), riboflavin (200 mg), and zinc (50 mg) could result, after 1 year, in a lower prevalence of precancerous lesions of the esophagus in the group receiving the active treatment as compared with the prevalence in the group receiving a placebo. The results of the trial, published elsewhere, indicated that the treatment had no effect on the prevalence of precancerous lesions of the esophagus. In determining whether an effect could be detected when earlier end points are used, the prevalence of micronuclei was evaluated in exfoliated cells from the esophagus and from the buccal mucosa in the present study. In a subsample of 200 out of the original 610 study subjects, smears were taken from the buccal mucosa before and after treatment, and in 170 subjects esophageal smears were obtained during endoscopy only after treatment. The smears were fixed and kept at room temperature over 1 year before being evaluated for the presence of micronuclei by means of 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescent staining. Smears from approximately half of the subjects were considered suitable for evaluation. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of micronuclei in the buccal mucosa cells was observed before and after treatment (the mean percentage of micronucleated cells in the vitamin group upon first examination, before treatment started, 0.35%; 1 year after treatment, 0.31%) or between the treatment and the placebo group at the final examination. (The mean percentage of micronucleated cells in the vitamin-treated group was 0.31 and 0.39% in the placebo group.) However, a statistically significant reduction (P = .04) was observed in the prevalence of micronuclei in esophageal cells in the treatment group as compared to the placebo. (The mean percentage of micronucleated cells in the vitamin-treated group was 0.19%; it was 0.31% in the placebo group.\r"

The view that ependymal cells and astrocytes share a common precursor is also partly supported by the observations.\r"

  ".U": "88012016\r", 
  ".W": "SL/Ni mice were found to be highly polymorphic in the expression of endogenous ecotropic virus (ETV). By selective mating of the mice with either high-virus or virus-free phenotypes, the following stably virus-positive and virus-negative sublines were obtained: SL/Ni-Eco+ and SL/Ni-Eco-, respectively. This polymorphism was produced by an epigenetic factor transmitted by SL/Ni-Eco- female mice via milk. F1 hybrids between SL/Ni-Eco- females with males of high-virus strains did not express ETV, whereas reciprocal F1 hybrids did. On the other hand, F1 mice between females of low-virus strains or of NFS mice lacking the ETV proviral genome and SL/Ni-Eco- males expressed a high level of ETV. Foster-nursing of newborn mice of high-virus strains by SL/Ni-Eco- foster-mothers or injection of pooled sera of SL/Ni-Eco mice resulted in intense inhibition of virus expression. On the contrary, nursing of SL/Ni-Eco- newborns by NFS/N foster-mothers resulted in high virus expression. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that failure to express ETV by SL/Ni-Eco- mice is due to a milk-transmitted maternal resistance factor, but probably not due to genetic heterogeneity among SL/Ni sublines. This factor caused strong, long-lasting, and selective suppression of endogenous ETV, but it did not confer resistance to exogenous infection of ETV. This activity was present also in the sera of SL/Ni-Eco- mice, since neonatal injection of the sera into high-virus strains of mice, SL/Ni-Eco+, SL/Kh, and AKR/Ms, caused strong selective suppression of ETV expression. By this procedure, the spontaneous occurrence of nonthymic lymphomas in SL/Kh mice was suppressed.\r"

Three samples of chrysotile asbestos (mean length: 3.2, 2.1, and 1.2 micron) induced mesotheliomas at a rate of 48, 52, and 19%, respectively. The first sample was acid leached prior to intrapleural injection; in that group, the percentage of mesotheliomas was reduced to 25%. Treatment with amosite and crocidolite resulted in the occurrence of 57 and 56% of mesotheliomas. Acid-treatment of amphiboles did not significantly modify the percentage of mesotheliomas. When the Stanton's fiber dimensions were taken into consideration to correlate with mesothelioma incidence, the observed number of mesotheliomas in the chrysotile-treated animals was much lower than that expected, suggesting that other fiber parameters (chemistry, physicochemistry) play a role in the carcinogenicity. Attapulgite fibers (mean length: 0.77 micron) did not induce tumor, and the mean survival time was of the same order as that observed in the control groups. The injection of quartz resulted in no mesothelioma but did result in 6 malignant histiocytic lymphomas (17%) and 2 malignant schwannomas (6%). In vitro experiments did not show strong correlation between cytotoxicity and the carcinogenic potency of these minerals, but the qualitative cellular responses might give some indications on the fiber's potency. In addition, the in vitro effects of the fibers seem to be modulated by their size.\r"

These results are concluded to be consistent with the proposal that host tissues of tumor-bearing animals may become \"dedifferentiated,\" and in this example the mechanism of the expression of the dedifferentiation involved the significant decrease in specific enzyme production.\r"

  ".W": "The combined cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide [(CYC) CAS: 50-18-0] and glutathione [(GSH) CAS: 70-18-8] depletion by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) toward EMT6/SF tumors and mouse bone marrow was studied in male BALB/c mice. Tumor GSH was depleted to 28.7 and 7.8% of control by 1 or 2 doses of BSO (5 mmol/kg), respectively, administered ip at 12-hour intervals prior to assay. Tumor GSH could be maintained at a level 8% of control by daily dosing with BSO for 3 days. The same BSO administration schedule lowered bone marrow cell GSH to 31% of control for the 3-day period studied. Tumor growth and bone marrow cell counts were unaffected by all BSO treatments studied. However, BSO pretreatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of CYC to tumor cells, as measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay, but it did not enhance the depletion of bone marrow cells in CYC-treated mice. The magnitude of the enhancement of CYC cytotoxicity by BSO depended on the extent of GSH depletion, tumor size, and the CYC dosing schedule: Single and double doses of BSO enhanced the cytotoxicity of a single dose of CYC by factors of 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, in 7-day-old tumors, based on the dose of CYC required to produce a surviving fraction of 4 X 10(-3). The response of 9-day-old tumors to CYC suggested the presence of a subpopulation of cells that were relatively resistant to CYC. There was no evidence for this subpopulation in BSO-pretreated tumors. Multiple doses of BSO and CYC also combined to give enhanced (1.65-fold) tumor cell killing compared to tumors treated with CYC alone. The data suggest a possible role for BSO as a clinical chemosensitizer, which could be combined with fractionated doses of CYC and may be effective on small cancerous lesions.\r"

The fluorescence of intracellular anthracycline measured on a flow cytometer was used as a marker to distinguish P388/S and P388/R cells. The proportions of low-fluorescent P388/R cells and high-fluorescent P388/S cells were determined from fluorescence histograms. Selective toxicity for multidrug-resistant P388/R cells was indicated by the decreased proportion of these cells in the mixed cultures. In untreated cultures grown from suspensions containing equal proportions of P388/R and P388/S cells, the mean proportion of P388/R cells after 4 days' growth was 34.4%. DOX eliminated P388/S cells from mixed cultures. Nitrogen mustard [(HN2) NCS-762] and x-rays were selectively toxic to P388/R cells. The selectivity of HN2 and x-rays was observed in a narrow dose range by the absence of selective inhibition at low doses, the decreased proportion of P388/R cells at moderate doses, and the killing of all cells in mixed cultures at high doses. Combination treatment of mixed cultures with DOX plus x-rays, or HN2 plus x-rays, produced complete inhibition of growth. Mixed cultures recovered after treatment with DOX plus HN2 contained only P388/R cells. Results obtained by colony-formation assay showed the same patterns of relative sensitivity for P388/R and P388/S cells as the data obtained by flow cytometry (FCM) selectivity assay. FCM analysis of mixed cultures detected selective toxicity for P388/R cells after treatments, characterized by approximately 1 log higher cell killing of P388/R cells than of P388/S cells. It was concluded that FCM analysis of mixed cultures provided a sensitive and reliable assay for fast screening of drugs for selective toxicity to multidrug-resistant cells.\r"

Growth and metastasis of these implants were examined and compared with those occurring following sc tumor implantation in the flank. Corneal implants did not grow well or metastasize. Iridial implants grew well, and tumor typically filled the eye within a few weeks. If tumor-filled eyes were left intact, all rats died or became moribund 7-9 weeks later. Metastasis was seen in the lungs (11/11), cervical lymph nodes (7/11), body wall (5/11), heart (4/11), kidney (4/11), and liver (3/11). Removal (enucleation) of tumor-filled eyes prior to spread to the orbit prevented the development of overt metastatic disease for 1-2 years (11/11). When healthy enucleated rats were necropsied 0 days to 26 weeks post enucleation, small nodules were seen in the lung (9/13), liver (3/13), or spleen (1/13). Nodules were not seen in rats that had been housed in our animal facility for 1-2 years (16/16), had eye surgery with tumor implanted on the posterior surface of the cornea (6/6), or had been subjected to the surgical procedures of corneal implantation and enucleation (3/3). When tumors were implanted sc, rats died after 6-7 weeks. Metastasis was seen in the lung (12/12), lymph nodes (12/12), spleen (1/12), and liver (1/12). Removal of very small flank tumors failed to prevent animals from dying 7-8 weeks later with pulmonary and lymph node metastasis (10/10). In summary, iridial implantation resulted in an altered pattern of metastasis. Animals that had iridial implants and enucleation failed to develop overt metastatic disease and had small nodules in the lung, liver, or spleen.\r"

  ".W": "A 2.5-year epidemiologic study of a breeding group of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which is a focus of endemic simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS), demonstrated a strong association between the occurrence of SAIDS and infection with a type D retrovirus, SAIDS retrovirus serotype 1 (SRV-1). Of 23 healthy \"tracer\" juvenile rhesus monkeys, 19 (83%) died with SAIDS within 9 months of introduction into the resident SAIDS-endemic population. In contrast, 21 healthy \"sentinel\" juvenile rhesus monkeys placed in the same outdoor enclosure but denied physical contact with the SAIDS-affected group by a 10-foot-wide \"buffer zone\" remained free of SRV-1, SRV-1 antibody, and disease for 2.5 years. The SAIDS-specific mortality rate was significantly higher in juveniles than in adults. In repeated serologic testing, the overall prevalence of SRV-1 antibody ranged from 68 to 85%. Antibody prevalence increased with age. Seroconversion was found to be a poor indicator of infection rate, as approximately 50% of virus-positive juvenile monkeys had no antibody detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Repeated viral isolations from all animals revealed 1) SRV-1 viremia with clinical SAIDS; 2) persistent viremia and viral shedding in apparently healthy animals; 3) transient viremia and clinical recovery; 4) intermittent viremia, suggesting activation of latent infections; and 5) viremia in a 1-day-old infant, suggesting transplacental transmission. The prevalence of SRV-1 antibody in SAIDS-free breeding groups of rhesus monkeys was 4%. The seroprevalence of antibodies against human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV; formerly STLV-III) was uniformly low or absent in both SAIDS-free and SAIDS-affected groups of rhesus monkeys, demonstrating that these retroviruses are not etiologically linked to SAIDS at the California Primate Research Center.\r"

Six weeks of PTU treatment resulted in a significant increase in pituitary gland weight and in the percentage of pituitary prolactin (PRL) cells. The percentage of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) cells was slightly increased in PTU-treated rats. DES treatment produced a thirteenfold increase in pituitary gland weight and a significant increase in the percentage of PRL cells as well as in serum PRL levels. Combined PTU-DES treatment increased pituitary gland weight and serum PRL levels, but this increase was less than that observed with only DES treatment. A relative decrease in the percentage of TSH cells was seen after both DES and PTU-DES treatment. Ultrastructural immunohistochemical studies showed two types of PRL cells in the pituitary of all groups. Classical PRL cells with granule diameters of 150-800 nm were most abundant in DES-treated groups, whereas cells with smaller granules, 100-350 nm in diameter, were equally prominent in control groups and after PTU treatment. The results of this study show that while PTU causes a slight increase in pituitary gland weight and in PRL cell numbers, it inhibits estrogen-induced PRL cell hyperplasia. This model can be used to study the effects of PTU on pituitary PRL cell morphology and on the regulation of PRL cell hyperplasia.\r"

We examined the importance of fecal bile acid dilution by wheat bran (WB) in inhibiting colonic tumorigenesis in an experimental animal model. Male F344 rats received oral doses of the colon carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine [CAS: 540-73-8] and were assigned randomly to groups fed one of four semipurified diets for 26 weeks. The diets were fiber-free (FF), 10% WB, FF + bile salts, or WB + bile salts. The amount of bile salts added was adjusted to produce a fecal bile acid concentration in the group fed WB + bile salts equal to that found in the FF groups. Fecal bile acid concentrations at 12 and 24 weeks in the WB + bile salts group were similar to those in the FF group. Gross and microscopic findings at necropsy revealed a reduced total number and multiplicity of colon tumors in both bran-fed groups. Although the fecal bile acid concentrations of the FF and WB + bile salts groups were equal, the latter showed a significant reduction in tumor yield.\r"

  ".W": "For the study of the effects of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on early mammalian cell differentiation, a complementary DNA (cDNA) library was constructed on the poly(A)+RNAs extracted from undifferentiated F9 cells derived from a 129/Sv mouse teratocarcinoma OTT6050, and screening was done for the cNDA sequences corresponding to the mRNAs, the levels of which decreased significantly in the F9 cells after the TPA treatment. From about 80,000 clones screened, 3 different cDNA clones, pFT27, pFT43, and pFT60, were isolated and characterized. Levels of the RNAs hybridizable to these clones were decreased by fourfold to more than fiftyfold within 1-10 hours in the presence of TPA. Northern blotting experiments identified transcripts corresponding to these clones: pFT27 hybridized to 3.0 kb RNA, pFT43 hybridized to 1.5 kb RNA, and pFT60 hybridized to 1.0 kb RNA. The levels of these 3 transcripts were also decreased after treatment of the undifferentiated F9 cells with retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP). The TPA-induced as well as the RA- and cAMP-induced decreases in the RNAs hybridizable to pFT27 were regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas similar decreases in the RNAs hybridizable to pFT43 and pFT60 were regulated at the post-transcriptional level. These findings show that TPA treatment shares common effects with RA and cAMP on the undifferentiated F9 cells.\r"

  ".W": "The abilities of 4 established human pancreatic tumor cell lines (PANC-1, CAPAN-1, AsPc-1, and BxPc-3) to synthesize and to maintain laminin-containing basement membranes when grown in the nude mouse have been examined and compared with synthesis of the glycoprotein laminin by these tumor cells when grown in culture. Immunohistochemical visualization of basement membrane integrity within the transplanted tumors employed a monoclonal antibody specific for human laminin to clearly distinguish between human tumor-produced laminin and murine basement membranes. This technique demonstrated strikingly different degrees of basement membrane formation and laminin distribution for the 4 biologically diverse pancreatic tumors. Basement membranes were present within the differentiated, less invasive tumors, whereas structure basement membranes were absent in the poorly differentiated, invasive tumors. Regardless of their propensity to produce basement membranes in vivo, all 4 pancreatic tumor cell lines continued to synthesize laminin in culture, as was determined by immunologic assays. The most invasive cell line, AsPc-1, released large quantities of soluble laminin into conditioned culture medium. The less invasive, well-differentiated tumor cells did not release laminin into the medium, but they retained the laminin produced by them within the cell layer. The combination of in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that the extent of basement membrane loss by these human pancreatic tumors is not due to an inherent inability of the tumor cells to synthesize the structural component laminin.\r"

No couple with a prenatal prediction of CF decided to continue with the pregnancy. 1 pregnancy was terminated because of a 50:50 chance of an affected fetus. In 1 twin pregnancy the affected fetus was selectively aborted, and the other baby was confirmed after birth to be unaffected, as predicted. In the other twin pregnancy the two chorionic plates could not be samples separately; the pregnancy was continued on the basis of normal findings for the lower plate, and both twins have turned out to be normal. Many couples at risk see early prenatal diagnosis as a way to help them have an unaffected child.\r"

This study in seven normal subjects given liquorice showed that sodium retention is associated with a significant change in cortisol metabolism indicating inhibition of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD). Congenital deficiency of this enzyme produces a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. It is suggested that in both conditions there is a defect in the renal conversion of cortisol to cortisone by 11 beta-OHSD which results in high intrarenal cortisol levels, acting on type 1 mineralocorticoid receptors to cause sodium retention.\r"

Every 4 to 10 months a clinical and laboratory examination was performed and serum samples were tested for three HIV markers: HIV antigen, antibody to p24, and antibody to gp41. Twenty-two subjects (23 percent) were found to be positive for HIV antigen: 8 were positive upon entry and remained so (Group 1), and 14 became positive during the study, 4 to 26 months after HIV antibody appeared (seroconversion), 13 of whom remained positive for HIV antigen (Group 2). Most subjects positive for HIV antigen had low or undetectable titers of antibody to p24, whereas the antibody titer to gp41 remained high. In Group 2, patients with low p24 antibody titers had further decreases in their titers before or at the time HIV antigen appeared. Once present, HIV antigen persisted and tended to increase in concentration. In contrast to Group 3 (negative for HIV antigen, low anti-p24 titer) and 4 (negative for HIV antigen, high anti-p24 titer), the groups positive for HIV antigen had significantly higher incidences of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (P = 0.05), immunodeficiency-related infections (P less than 0.001), and immune thrombocytopenia (P = 0.001), and had more severe disease as measured by the Walter Reed staging system (P less than 0.001). In this study, HIV antigen appeared to be a better predictive marker of HIV-related complications than the absolute T4+ count. These results suggest that HIV antigenemia indicates a poor clinical prognosis.\r"

The superficial masseter muscle was more tender in \"normal\" patients and in \"reducing meniscus\" patients than in \"without meniscus reduction\" patients. The medial pterygoid muscle was more tender in \"normal\" patients and in \"without meniscus reduction\" patients than in \"reducing meniscus\" patients. Though there are some significant findings with respect to muscle palpation, by itself muscle palpation is not a specific indicator of temporomandibular joint internal derangement.\r"

During mucoperiosteal flap dissection 12 patients experienced unacceptable pain. In total, only 2 of the patients tolerated the entire procedure; however, they reported severe pain during the final part of the operation. In conclusion, it seems that acupuncture as performed in the present study could not subserve as a routine method for analgesia in this type of operative procedure.\r"

In most cases there is an associated history of recurrent pericoronitis. The clinicopathologic features of 50 cases are reviewed. The frequency of the paradental cyst is 3% to 5% of all odontogenic cysts, although we believe its true incidence to be higher. All cases occur in the mandible, and there is a marked preponderance in males. White persons are affected more frequently than blacks. The size of the cysts varies from 1 to 2 cm; they are attached to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and the coronal third of the roots. Histologically, they cannot be distinguished from other inflammatory odontogenic cysts. While origin from junctional epithelium or cell rests of Malassez cannot be entirely excluded, we favor an origin from reduced enamel epithelium and suggest that cyst formation occurs as a result of unilateral expansion of the dental follicle secondary to inflammatory destruction of bone and periodontium.\r"

The vast majority of lymphocytes were T cells, scattered individually or in small groups of three or four cells and dispersed throughout the granulomas without any topographic predilection, with prevalence of T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells over T-helper/inducer cells. Our findings of numerous plasma cells, which were in agreement with descriptions of numerous immunoglobulin-producing cells by other authors, imply the participation of antibody-mediated immune reactions in periapical granulomas. The presence of cell-mediated immunity, in spite of numerous T cells, could not be confirmed.\r"

The images were evaluated for speed, contrast, fog and base, resolution, and granularity, and the useful lifetime of the solutions was determined. E-speed film processed with rapid chemistry produced images equal in quality to D-speed film in the range tested (70 to 90 kVp). Fog and base levels of E-speed film were greater than those of D-speed film. The resolution and granularity of the images were equal and were judged adequate in both film types, regardless of the chemistry used. Rapid processing solutions were found to have a 10% to 15% shorter useful lifetime with E-speed film than with D-speed film. The processing of E-speed film in rapid chemistry is recommended for emergency care and endodontics.\r"

S. mutans levels in the 0.4% SnF2 group were significantly lower than in the 1.0% NaF gel group. The low levels of S. mutans observed in the SnF2 group suggest that this agent may be exerting a downward selective pressure on the microorganism during the postradiotherapy period.\r"

It is considered to be the extraosseous counterpart of the central odontogenic fibroma. Because of the paucity of reported cases, the full histomorphologic spectrum of this lesion has not yet been established. This article presents nine cases of peripheral odontogenic fibroma that illustrate the variety of its histopathologic findings. The connective tissue ranged from loose (almost myxomatous) to markedly cellular to relatively acellular and well-collagenized. Islands and/or strands of odontogenic epithelium were present in all lesions. Matrix of mineralized material was present in three cases, and juxtaepithelial hyalinization was seen in one case. To avoid the introduction of additional diagnostic terms, we suggest that all these lesions be considered a spectrum of the peripheral odontogenic fibroma (WHO type). We also suggest that the term WHO type be used to distinguish peripheral odontogenic fibromas from the peripheral ossifying fibroma with which they have often been confused.\r"

The occurrence of the same abnormalities in two or more unrelated patients suggests, but does not prove, that pathogenesis in both cases may be the same.

The most valuable advantage of parotid CT sialography is the possibility of demonstrating the tumor and its actual size and relationship to the surrounding structures.

Addition of Cd and Cu to Cd-resistant Datura innoxia cell cultures results in the rapid synthesis and accumulation of sulfur-rich, metal-binding polypeptides. The structure of these compounds was determined using amino acid analysis, 13C NMR, and site-specific enzymic digestion. These compounds are poly(gamma-glutamylcysteinyl)glycines. Greater than 80% of the cellular Cd is bound to the bis and tris forms in Cd-resistant cells. There is a direct correlation between the maximum accumulation of the metal-binding polypeptides and the concentration of toxic ions to which the cells are resistant. In the presence of metal ions, the polypeptides form multimeric aggregates that can be resolved by gel chromatography. Cd binds to both the high and low molecular weight aggregates, whereas Cu preferentially binds to the higher molecular weight forms. The presence of gamma-carboxamide linkages between glutamyl and adjacent cysteinyl residues indicates that these polypeptides are products of biosynthetic pathways. Poly(gamma-glutamylcysteinyl)glycines bind metals and, in this respect, appear to be functional analogs of the protein metallothionein. However, in the absence of supraoptimal concentrations of trace metal ions, the functions of metallothionein in animals and microorganisms and poly(gamma-glutamylcysteinyl)glycines in plants may differ.\r"

An expression plasmid, based on the EC-SOD complementary DNA, was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). The transfected cells secreted human EC-SOD to the culture medium. The secreted recombinant (r) EC-SOD was isolated in high yield with a three-step procedure beginning with immobilized monoclonal anti-EC-SOD antibodies. The properties of the rEC-SOD were compared with native (n) EC-SOD isolated from human umbilical cords. The specific activities and amino-terminal amino acid sequences were identical. The amino acid compositions were virtually identical and very similar to the composition deduced from the complementary DNA sequence. Both rEC-SOD and nEC-SOD contained 4 Cu and 4 Zn atoms per molecule, and the presence of Zn in EC-SOD is thus now established. The rEC-SOD produced is type C, since its affinity for heparin-Sepharose was identical to that of nEC-SOD type C. Both enzymes bound to concanavalin A, lentil lectin, and wheat germ lectin and are thus glycoproteins. rEC-SOD and nEC-SOD seem to have the same subunit structure and composition as analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel chromatography.\r"

This assay is extremely sensitive since all DNA fragments without photoproducts (background) are reduced to small oligonucleotides, which can be separated from those fragments containing photoproducts. The results show that the distribution of UV-induced photoproducts (primarily cyclobutane dipyrimidines) is not uniform throughout core DNA but displays a striking 10.3 (+/- 0.1) base periodicity. Furthermore, this characteristic distribution of photoproducts was obtained regardless of whether nucleosome core DNA was isolated from UV-irradiated intact chromatin fibers, histone H1-depleted chromatin fibers, isolated mononucleosomes, or cells in culture. The yield of pyrimidine dimers along the DNA seems to be modulated in a manner that reflects structural features of the nucleosome unit, possibly core histone-DNA interactions, since this pattern was not obtained for UV-irradiated core DNA either free in solution or bound tightly to calcium phosphate crystals. Based on their location relative to DNase I cutting sites, the sites of maximum pyrimidine dimer formation in core DNA mapped to positions where the phosphate backbone is farthest from the core histone surface. These results indicate that within the core region of nucleosomes, histone-DNA interactions significantly alter the quantum yield of cyclobutane dipyrimidines, possibly by restraining conformational changes in the DNA helix required for formation of these photoproducts.\r"

  ".U": "88016148\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that cytosolic fractions of bovine brain contain two immunologically distinct forms of phospholipase C (PLC), PLC-I and PLC-II. We now report the purification of another form of inositolphospholipid-specific phospholipase C from bovine brain cytosol, designated PLC-III, and the comparison of the catalytic properties of the three isozymes. Approximately 450 micrograms of pure PLC-III was obtained from 36 bovine brains, and it had a final specific activity of 30-40 mumol of phosphatidylinositol hydrolyzed per min per mg of enzyme in the presence of 0.1% deoxycholate. PLC-III exhibited an apparent Mr of 85,000 in NaDodSO4/PAGE, which is considerably smaller than the Mr of 150,000 for PLC-I and 145,000 for PLC-II. Neither of the two mixtures of monoclonal antibodies nor the rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against either PLC-I or PLC-II cross-reacted with PLC-III. The catalytic properties of the three isozymes were studied by using small unilamellar vesicles prepared from either phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) as substrates. Hydrolysis of both PtdIns and PtdInsP2 by the three enzymes was dependent on Ca2+. However, at low Ca2+ concentration, PtdInsP2 was the preferred substrate for all three enzymes. When PtdIns was the substrate, the three enzymes exhibited similar specific activities at their optimum pH, which was 4.8 for PLC-I, 5.0 for PLC-II, and 5.5 for PLC-III. But at neutral pH, the order of specific activity was PLC-III greater than PLC-II greater than PLC-I. In contrast, the order of specific activity was PLC-I greater than PLC-III greater than PLC-II for PtdInsP2 hydrolysis, which means that PLC-I is the most specific for PtdInsP2. The three enzymes were affected differently by bovine serum albumin: inhibition of PLC-I and activation of PLC-III were observed, whereas PLC-II was unaffected. This observation suggests that any putative protein effectors for PLC should be critically scrutinized.\r"

The formula used is restricted to cases in which the concentration of receptor is negligible compared to the concentration of both the displacing ligand and the radioactive ligand used. In this study, we rigorously derive a simple equation that can be used for calculating receptor-ligand dissociation constants for any set of experimental conditions. A linearized form of this equation provides a convenient plot from which the dissociation constant of the displacing ligand can be directly obtained. The plot is also a test for the competitive mode of binding. This exact equation now allows us to estimate the error incurred by the conventionally used equations. Similarly, we show that for competitive inhibition in enzymology, one can derive the analogous formula. Our new formula is free of the usual restrictions--namely, that the enzyme concentration is very small compared to the concentration of both the substrate and the inhibitor. It may therefore be applied to any set of experimental conditions.\r"

In the present study, we have found that the insulinoma gene was activated in a BK virus-induced hamster insulinoma cell line and in a spontaneously occurring human insulinoma. From the hamster and human insulinoma cDNA libraries, rig homologues were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. In the same manner as the rat gene, both hamster and human homologues contained one open reading frame of 435 nucleotides, differing by 32- and 41-base substitutions, respectively. All the base substitutions were same-sense mutations. Accordingly, the deduced 145-amino acid sequence remained invariant in hamster, human, and rat insulinomas, suggesting that rig has evolved under extraordinarily strong selective constraints. Computerized structure analysis indicated that rig-encoded protein is a possible DNA-binding protein. The antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to hamster rig mRNA was synthesized and injected into the hamster insulinoma cells. The antisense rig oligodeoxyribonucleotide inhibited DNA synthesis in the insulinoma cells, whereas the sense rig oligodeoxyribonucleotide or antisense insulin oligodeoxyribonucleotide had no inhibitory effect. These results strongly suggest that the activation of rig is both common and potentially significant in the oncogenic growth of pancreatic B cells of islets of Langerhans.\r"

Both substitutions stabilize the protein toward reversible and irreversible thermal denaturation at physiological pH. The substitutions have no effect on enzymatic activity. High-resolution crystallographic analysis of the proline-containing mutant protein (Ala-82----Pro) shows that its three-dimensional structure is essentially identical with the wild-type enzyme. The overall structure of the other mutant enzyme (Gly-77----Ala) is also very similar to wild-type lysozyme, although there are localized conformational adjustments in the vicinity of the altered amino acid. The combination of a number of such amino acid replacements, each of which is expected to contribute approximately 1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) to the free energy of folding, may provide a general strategy for substantial improvement in the stability of a protein.\r"

We have identified four monkey ORS (ORS3, -8, -9, and -12) that can support plasmid replication in mammalian cells. This replication is carried out in a controlled and semiconservative manner characteristic of mammalian replicons. ORS replication was most efficient in HeLa cells.

Five overlapping clones, representing 2.4 kilobases, were isolated. The sequenced cDNA contained 207 base pairs of coding sequence 5' to the amino terminus of the mature protein in which there were four ATG translation start sites in the same reading frame as the protein. Only the ATG coding for Met-(-28) lay within a favorable consensus sequence for functional initiators. There were 1722 base pairs of coding sequence corresponding to the protein found circulating in human serum. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA exactly matched the 574 amino acid sequence of human serum cholinesterase, as previously determined by Edman degradation. Therefore, our clones represented cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) rather than acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7). It was concluded that the amino acid sequences of cholinesterase from two different tissues, human brain and human serum, were identical. Hybridization of genomic DNA blots suggested that a single gene, or very few genes, coded for cholinesterase.\r"

We have utilized N. crassa strains that produce both normal and carboxyl-terminal-truncated forms of carbamoyl phosphate synthase A to ask whether the carboxyl terminus affects import of the carbamoyl phosphate synthase A precursor. We found that carboxyl-terminal-truncated precursors were directed to mitochondria but that they were imported less efficiently than full-length proteins that were synthesized in the same cytoplasm. Our results suggest that effective import of proteins into mitochondria requires appropriate combinations of targeting sequences and three-dimensional structure.\r"

Although the two binding regions are distinctly separated, each corresponds to a cis region required for muscle-specific transcriptional stimulation, and each contains a core CC(A + T-rich)6GG sequence (designated CArG box), which is found in the promoter regions of several muscle-associated genes. Each site has an apparently different binding affinity for trans-acting factors, which may explain the different transcriptional stimulation activities of the two cis regions. Therefore, we conclude that the two CArG box regions are responsible for muscle-specific transcriptional activity of the cardiac alpha-actin gene through a mechanism that involves their binding of a positive trans-acting factor in muscle cells.\r"

In the present studies, we have expressed the entire coding sequences of the TRK oncogene as well as its protein kinase-related carboxyl-terminal domain in Escherichia coli. Antisera raised against these bacteria-synthesized TRK polypeptides has allowed us to identify the gene product of the TRK oncogene as a 70-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitates containing p70TRK have an associated protein kinase activity specific for tyrosine residues. Moreover, p70TRK is phosphorylated in vivo in serine (75%), threonine (20%), and tyrosine (5%) residues. Finally, immunofluorescence and cellular fractionation studies indicate that p70TRK is preferentially located in the cytoplasmic fraction.\r"

The first 40 amino acids of the derived protein sequence are identical to those determined by N-terminal sequencing of SVP-1 isolated from the lumen of the seminal vesicle. This finding confirms that SVP-1 is cleaved from the C terminus of a larger precursor protein. The portion of the nucleotide sequence that codes for SVP-1 contains eight highly homologous but imperfect repeats of a 72-nucleotide domain. This repeated structure is also evident at the amino acid level. The consensus 24-amino acid repeat unit contains two lysine and three glutamine residues. Since the clotting of SVP-1 is known to involve the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinks, it is likely that the 24-amino acid repeating unit is the unit of function of SVP-1.\r"

DNA sequencing of the 1.2-kilobase insert of CEF-4 revealed an open reading frame that predicts an 11-kDa protein. The predicted pCEF-4 gene product is homologous to human connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III) and platelet factor 4 (PF-4). Serum stimulation of quiescent normal CEF results in a rapid but transient expression of pCEF-4 mRNA. Hence, pCEF-4 mRNA is expressed at the G0-G1 transition and during the first G1 phase of normal CEF reentering the cell cycle. The expression of pCEF-4 mRNA in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF appears to be the result of transcriptional activation and stabilization of the transcript.\r"

  ".W": "Acanthamoeba castellanii myosins IA and IB demonstrate the catalytic properties of a myosin and can support analogues of contractile and motile activity in vitro, but their single, low molecular weight heavy chains, roughly globular shapes, and inabilities to self-assemble into filaments make them structurally atypical myosins. We now present the complete amino acid sequence of the 128-kDa myosin IB heavy chain, which we deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene and which reveals that the polypeptide is a fusion of myosin-like and non-myosin-like sequences. Specifically, the amino-terminal approximately 76 kDa of amino acid sequence is highly similar to the globular head sequences of conventional myosins. By contrast, the remaining approximately 51 kDa of sequence shows no similarity to any portion of conventional myosin sequences, contains regions that are rich in glycine, proline, and alanine residues, and lacks the distinctive sequence characteristics of an alpha-helical, coiled-coil structure. We conclude, therefore, that the protein is composed of a myosin globular head fused not to the typical coiled-coil rod-like myosin tail structure but rather to an unusual carboxyl-terminal domain. These results support the conclusion that filamentous myosin is not required for force generation and provide a further perspective on the structural requirements for myosin function. Finally, we find a striking conservation of intron/exon structure between this gene and a vertebrate muscle myosin gene. We discuss this observation in relation to the evolutionary origin of the myosin IB gene and the antiquity of myosin gene intron/exon structure.\r"

  ".W": "We have purified and determined the complete primary structure of human stromelysin, a secreted metalloprotease with a wide range of substrate specificities. Human stromelysin is synthesized in a preproenzyme form with a calculated size of 53,977 Da and a 17-amino acid long signal peptide. Prostromelysin is secreted in two forms, with apparent molecular masses on NaDodSO4/PAGE of 60 and 57 kDa. The minor 60-kDa polypeptide is a glycosylated form of the major 57-kDa protein containing N-linked complex oligosaccharides. Zymogen activation by trypsin results in the removal of 84 amino acids from the amino terminus of the enzyme generating a 45-kDa active enzyme species. Human stromelysin is capable of degrading proteoglycan, fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen but not interstitial type I collagen. The enzyme is not capable of activating purified human fibroblast procollagenase. Analysis of its primary structure shows that stromelysin is in all likelihood the human analog of rat transin, which is an oncogene transformation-induced protease. The pattern of enzyme expression in normal and tumorigenic cells revealed that human skin fibroblasts in vitro secrete stromelysin constitutively (1-2 micrograms per 10(6) cells per 24 hr). Human fetal lung fibroblasts transformed with simian virus 40, human bronchial epithelial cells transformed with the ras oncogene, fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080), and a melanoma cell strain (A 2058), do not express this protease nor can the enzyme be induced in these cells by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Our data indicate that the expression and the possible involvement of secreted metalloproteases in tumorigenesis result from a specific interaction between the transforming factor and the target cell, which may vary in different species.\r"

The nucleotide sequences encoding the NH2-terminal leader peptide and first 26 amino acids of the two proteins are nearly identical. This homologous region is followed by areas specific to either glycophorin A or B and a number of small regions of homology, which in turn are followed by a very homologous region encoding the presumed membrane-spanning portion of the proteins. We used RNA blot hybridization with both cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes to prove our previous hypothesis that glycophorin B is encoded by a single 0.5- to 0.6-kb mRNA and to show that glycophorins A and B are negatively and coordinately regulated by a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

This result represents presumptive evidence for common underlying mechanisms in functional molecules and gels. Thus, the present and highly perfectible model explains why and how, depending on initial conditions, a system may respond differently to an external parameter and similarly to different parameters.

Furthermore, the nucleolar localization of bFGF is correlated with a stimulation of transcription of ribosomal genes during G0----G1 transition induced by bFGF alone in adult bovine aortic endothelial cells (ABAE cells). Stimulation of ribosomal gene transcription is preceded by a significant increase of the major nonhistone nucleolar protein, nucleolin. In vitro, the growth factor has a direct effect on the enhancement of RNA polymerase I activity in isolated nuclei from quiescent sparse (G0) ABAE cells. The direct action of bFGF on the level of ribosomal gene transcription could correspond to an additional growth-signaling pathway, mediated by this growth factor.\r"

BPA is a heat-stable integral membrane glycoprotein of Mr 28,000 by gel filtration whose activity is eluted from NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels as a broad band at Mr 25,000-29,000. The growth stimulator appears to be erythroid-specific, stimulating proliferation of the human erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) by up to 600% of control values when tested in serum-free bone marrow culture. In contrast, it is devoid of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor activity and has a negligible effect on the formation of human megakaryocyte and mixed hematopoietic colonies. Polyclonal anti-lymphocyte membrane IgG, which neutralizes BPA expression in culture, completely absorbs BPA from all lymphocyte-derived sources [solubilized lymphocyte plasma membranes, membrane-containing vesicles shed into lymphocyte conditioned medium (LCM) and soluble vesicle-free LCM supernatants], suggesting that soluble and membrane-derived lymphocyte BPA are antigenically related.

It was also observed that a 50-kDa desmin peptide, missing 27 C-terminal residues, retained the ability to bind to both membrane preparations. Displacement experiments with an excess of purified vimentin suggested that the two desmin derivatives were interacting with a previously identified vimentin receptor at the nuclear envelope, the protein lamin B [Georgatos, S. & Blobel, G. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 117-127]. Additional analysis by affinity chromatography confirmed this conclusion. Employing an overlay assay, we demonstrated that the 50-kDa fragment, but not the 45-kDa desmin peptide, was capable of interacting with the plasma membrane polypeptide ankyrin (a known vimentin attachment site), as was intact vimentin. Conversely, the nuclear envelope protein lamin B was recognized by both fragments but not by a chymotryptic peptide composed solely of the helical rod domain of desmin. These data imply that the lamin B-binding site on desmin resides within the 21 residues following its helical rod domain, whereas the ankyrin-associating region is localized within its N-terminal head domain, exactly as in the case of vimentin.\r"

  ".W": "Three distinct endosomal fractions were isolated in high purity from livers of estradiol-treated rats. Each fraction had characteristic physical and ultrastructural properties, but the lipid composition and major proteins of their membranes were similar and differed from those derived from the Golgi apparatus. Injected radioiodinated low density lipoproteins accumulated first in the fraction of intermediate density and later in the low density fraction. The latter was composed almost exclusively of lipoprotein-filled multivesicular bodies, most of which had a single membranous appendage. The fraction of intermediate density was composed of lipoprotein-filled vesicles that were smaller than multivesicular bodies and also had membranous appendages. The high density fraction was composed of membranes resembling the appendages of the two vesicular fractions. All three fractions were enriched in receptors for low density lipoproteins and asialoglycoproteins, but receptor concentrations were considerably reduced in multivesicular bodies. The fraction of intermediate density may represent the compartment of uncoupling of receptor and ligand (CURL) described by Geuze et al. [Geuze, H. J., Slot, J. W., Strous, G. J. A. M., Lodish, H. F. & Schwartz, A. L. (1983) Cell 32, 277-287]. CURL vesicles may lose some of their appendage as multivesicular bodies are formed. The high density fraction then may represent a receptor-recycling compartment.\r"

Several copies of homeoboxes are also found in the mammalian genome, but it is not known whether these are components of morphogenetic loci in mammals as well. As a step toward understanding the function of mammalian homeoboxes, we have used in situ hybridization to define the spatial pattern of expression of two mouse homeobox genes in the midgestational mouse embryo. The two mouse homeoboxes studied here, Hox 1.2 and Hox 1.4, are located 20 kilobases apart on mouse chromosome 6. Our results demonstrate the following: (i) Hox 1.2 transcripts are localized mainly in the posterior myelencephalon, in the cervical central nervous system (CNS), and in several thoracic prevertebrae; (ii) Hox 1.4 transcripts are localized mainly in the posterior myelencephalon and in the cervical CNS; (iii) within the CNS region expressing Hox 1.4, the level of Hox 1.4 transcripts is higher in the mantle layer than in the ependymal layer and higher in the dorsal than in the ventral area. The specific localization of Hox 1.2 and Hox 1.4 transcripts in the embryonic CNS and the restricted pattern of expression along the rostrocaudal axis are strikingly reminiscent of the expression pattern of Drosophila homeoboxes in the fly embryo and larvae. Despite the different developmental strategies adopted by Drosophila and mammals, functional similarities may exist between Drosophila and mammalian homeobox genes.\r"

Hybridization with synthetic RNA probes was used to quantitate mRNA levels in situ. All 24 tumors with amplification of the EGFR gene had high levels of expression of this gene, while none of the 39 tumors without amplification had increased levels. This shows that, in human gliomas, large increases in the expression of the EGFR gene are invariably associated with alterations in gene structure.\r"

  ".U": "88016199\r", 
  ".W": "Overproduction of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) large envelope polypeptide by transgenic mice containing the entire HBV envelope coding region leads to the formation of extremely long (up to 800 nm), occasionally branching, filamentous 22-nm-diameter hepatitis B surface antigen particles that accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte and are not efficiently secreted. As the endoplasmic reticulum expands to accommodate the increasing cellular filament stores, the hepatocytes become enlarged, hydropic, and eosinophilic and also display the characteristic features of \"ground-glass\" cells. As filament storage progresses, the ground-glass cells undergo coagulative necrosis and the mice develop an age-dependent lesion, whose severity is related to the intracellular concentration of envelope polypeptide, that is characterized by focal hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, lobular macrophagic inflammation, and increased serum transaminase activity. Advanced lesions demonstrate hepatocellular hyperplasia evident as lobular architectural disarray and microscopic hepatocellular nodules, many of which no longer contain detectable HBV envelope antigens. These changes may become extreme, producing a massively enlarged liver due to multifocal nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Overproduction of the large HBV envelope polypeptide exerts major structural constraints on HBV particle formation, leading to reduced secretion and progressive intracellular accumulation of hepatitis B surface antigen, which can reach sufficiently high concentrations to be directly cytotoxic to hepatocytes in this transgenic mouse system.\r"

  ".U": "88016201\r", 
  ".W": "Previous in vivo turnover studies suggested that retarded clearance of low density lipoproteins (LDL) from the plasma of some hypercholesterolemic patients is due to LDL with defective receptor binding. The present study examined this postulate directly by receptor binding experiments. The LDL from a hypercholesterolemic patient (G.R.) displayed a reduced ability to bind to the LDL receptors on normal human fibroblasts. The G.R. LDL possessed 32% of normal receptor binding activity (approximately equal to 9.3 micrograms of G.R. LDL per ml were required to displace 50% of 125I-labeled normal LDL, vs. approximately equal to 3.0 micrograms of normal LDL per ml). Likewise, the G.R. LDL were much less effective than normal LDL in competing with 125I-labeled normal LDL for cellular uptake and degradation and in stimulating intracellular cholesteryl ester synthesis. The defect in LDL binding appears to be due to a genetic abnormality of apolipoprotein B-100: two brothers of the proband possess LDL defective in receptor binding, whereas a third brother and the proband's son have normally binding LDL. Further, the defect in receptor binding does not appear to be associated with an abnormal lipid composition or structure of the LDL: the chemical and physical properties of the particles were normal, and partial delipidation of the LDL did not alter receptor binding activity. Normal and abnormal LDL subpopulations were partially separated from plasma of two subjects by density-gradient ultracentrifugation, a finding consistent with the presence of a normal and a mutant allele. The affected family members appear to be heterozygous for this disorder, which has been designated familial defective apolipoprotein B-100. These studies indicate that the defective receptor binding results in inefficient clearance of LDL and the hypercholesterolemia observed in these patients.\r"

Developing retinal ganglion cell axons in hamsters were made to project permanently to the ventrobasal nucleus, rather than to the lateral geniculate nucleus. With respect to most of the ultrastructural features examined, the terminals and synaptic complexes of mature, anterogradely labeled retino-ventrobasal axons more closely resembled those of normal somatosensory afferents to the ventrobasal nucleus than they did those of normal retinofugal axons within the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that the ultrastructural differentiation of axon terminals and synaptic complexes is regulated largely by the target environment, although some features appear to be intrinsic to the afferent axons themselves.\r"

The absence of such molecules in the central nervous system of these animals may underlie the relative inability of axons to regenerate in this tissue after injury. In an effort to identify neurite growth-promoting molecules in tissues that support effective axonal regeneration, we have developed an in vitro bioassay that is sensitive to substrate-bound factors of peripheral nerve that influence the growth of neurites. In this assay, neonatal rat superior cervical ganglion explants are placed on longitudinal cryostat sections of fresh-frozen sciatic nerve, and the regrowing axons are visualized by catecholamine histofluorescence. Axons are found to regenerate effectively over sciatic nerve tissue sections. When ganglia are similarly explanted onto cryostat sections of adult rat central nervous system tissue, however, axonal regeneration is virtually absent. We have begun to identify the molecules in peripheral nerve that promote effective axonal regeneration by examining the effect of antibodies that interfere with the activity of previously described neurite growth-promoting factors. Axonal elongation over sciatic nerve tissue was found to be sensitive to the inhibitory effects of INO (for inhibitor of neurite outgrowth), a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and inhibits a neurite growth-promoting activity from PC-12 cell-conditioned medium. The INO antigen appears to be a molecular complex of laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In contrast, a rabbit antiserum that recognizes laminin purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma, stains the Schwann cell basal lamina of peripheral nerve, and inhibits neurite growth over purified laminin substrata has no detectable effect on the rate of axonal regeneration in our assay.\r"

However, its effect was demonstrable only on the vascularly remote left SCG but not on the directly infused right SCG. Accordingly, it was concluded that a metabolite of Gly-Gln, formed in the blood, is an active neurotrophic factor. Glycyl-L-glutamic acid and L-glutamic acid were subsequently found to have a similar but less marked effect on both SCG. In the present study an alternative explanation has been tested: that Gly-Gln must combine slowly with some component of plasma to enable it to penetrate the ganglion cells and exert its neurotrophic effect. Findings are consistent with the latter proposal.\r"

  ".U": "88016207\r", 
  ".W": "Elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration within the Hermissenda type B cell has previously been shown to cause transient reduction of both the early K+ current IA and the delayed, Ca2+-dependent K+ current ICa2+-K+, a reduction that is more permanent with classical conditioning. Other earlier experiments suggested that Ca2+-mediated reduction of K+ currents initially involves the dual activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and Ca2+/lipid-dependent protein kinases. In the present study, voltage-clamp conditions that cause substantial increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (i.e., a Ca2+ \"load\") were used to produce IA and ICa2+-K+ reduction with and without the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or cycloheximide or the control substance deacetylanisomycin in the bathing medium. Anisomycin (100 microM) and cycloheximide (100 microM) caused no significant change of resting membrane potential, holding current, or the non-voltage-dependent \"leak\" current. However, inhibition of protein synthesis prevented recovery from Ca2+-mediated K+-current reduction. This effect resembled the effect of injecting purified Ca2+-dependent kinases and was blocked by the presence of trifluoperazine in the bathing medium. Activation of protein kinase C with a water-soluble phorbol ester caused marked reduction of protein synthesis in Hermissenda neurons as monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Synthesis of new proteins therefore may be important for reversal of initial steps during memory storage, and Ca2+-activated phosphorylation pathways may initiate long-term changes by turning off (as well as by turning on) the synthesis of particular proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive amyloid deposition in senile plaques and cortical blood vessels may play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. We have used x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to study the molecular organization and morphology of macromolecular assemblies formed by three synthetic peptides homologous to beta protein of brain amyloid: beta-(1-28), residues 1-28 of the beta protein; [Ala16]beta-(1-28), beta-(1-28) with alanine substituted for lysine at position 16; and beta-(18-28), residues 18-28 of the beta protein. beta-(1-28) readily formed fibrils in vitro that were similar in ultrastructure to the in vivo amyloid and aggregated into large bundles resembling those of senile plaque cores. X-ray patterns from partially dried, oriented pellets showed a cross-beta-conformation. A series of small-angle, equatorial maxima were consistent with a tubular fibril having a mean diameter of 86 A and a wall composed of pairs of cross-beta-pleated sheets. The data may also be consistent with pairs of cross-beta-sheets that are centered 71-A apart. [Ala16]beta-(1-28) formed beta-pleated sheet assemblies that were dissimilar to in vivo fibrils. The width of the 10-A spacing indicated stacks of about six sheets. Thus, substitution of the uncharged alanine for the positively charged lysine in the beta-strand region enhances the packing of the sheets and dramatically alters the type of macromolecular aggregate formed. beta-(18-28) formed assemblies that had even a greater number of stacked sheets, approximately equal to 24 per diffracting domain as indicated by the sharp intersheet reflection. Our findings on these homologous synthetic assemblies help to define the specific sequence that is required to form Alzheimer-type amyloid fibrils, thus providing an in vitro model of age-related cerebral amyloidogenesis.\r"

Fourteen other patient characteristics were correlated with poor prognosis, including black race, weight loss, symptoms, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, increased peripheral blast cells and promyelocytes or basophils, increased blasts or basophils in the bone marrow, decreased megakaryocytes, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A multivariate analysis that accounted for the interactions of these factors identified old age as being of primary adverse prognostic significance in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, suggesting a biologic difference in the disease in older patients. The poor prognosis in elderly patients receiving present available therapy justifies promising and well tolerated investigational approaches such as interferons in patients in this age group.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence indicates that the homeostatic balance between elastase and antiprotease activity is altered in the infrarenal aorta of those patients with different types of aortic pathologic findings. The specific properties of elastase found in the aorta of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are discussed herein. Activity of elastase extracted from ten pooled AAA specimens was observed when incubated with several inhibitors: 13.2 per cent for phenyl-suphonyl flouride (PSF); 43.3 per cent for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); 77.7 per cent for pepstatin; 137.0 per cent for leupeptin, and 24.0 per cent for alpha-1-antitrypsin. Irreversible inhibition by PSF indicates that the elastase is a serine protease. The elastase is most likely not a metallo enzyme, since it had no absolute requirement for divalent cations as indicated by only partial inhibition by EDTA. Elastase activity is most likely not due to cathepsins B or D, since cathepsins are active in an acid pH and selectively inhibited by leupeptin and pepstatin. The pH curve revealed a maximum activity at pH 8.2 and elastase activity was significantly inhibited by alpha-1-antitrypsin in a dose response manner determining functional elastase activity. These data indicate that the elastase in the aorta of patients with an AAA has the exact properties of the serine elastase found in the smooth muscle cells of the aorta in rats. These results also confirm the critical role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in determining functional elastase activity. Smooth muscle cell regulation of elastin metabolism may be important in determining why some patients have AAA and others have occlusive aortic disease develop.\r"

The authors conclude that (1) hCG-alpha is neither a tissue nor a tumor-specific marker; (2) hCG-alpha is produced by a variable proportion (21-55%) of endocrine tumors arising in various organs but not by ileal carcinoids, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, nor Merkel cell tumors; (3) hCG-alpha is a marker of malignancy only in pancreatic endocrine tumors; and (4) hCG-beta is rarely, if ever, produced by tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred forty-two patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis were reviewed to identify significant biologic and prognostic associations. Twenty percent of patients had lymphoid blast crisis. Clonal evolution was present in 60 percent of patients at blast crisis and involved most frequently the development of a double Philadelphia chromosome, trisomy 8, or isochromosome 17. The overall median survival from blast crisis was 18 weeks. Patient characteristics demonstrated to have significant association with short survival were: anemia; thrombocytopenia; myeloid or undifferentiated blast cell morphology; clonal evolution involving the presence of a double Philadelphia chromosome, trisomy 8, or isochromosome 17; and low marrow blast percentage. Of 195 patients who received therapy for blast crisis, complete remission was achieved in 44 (23 percent) patients, and 24 (13 percent) patients had a partial remission or hematologic improvement. Lower complete remission rates were associated with old age, thrombocytopenia, myeloid or undifferentiated blast cell morphology, clonal evolution--especially isochromosome 17 and trisomy 8--and long interval from diagnosis to onset of blast crisis. A multivariate analysis identified two characteristics to have independent prognostic importance for both survival and remission: platelet counts and blast cell morphology. In addition, clonal evolution had additive prognostic value for survival (double Philadelphia chromosome) and for response (isochromosome 17). The beneficial association of therapy with survival was demonstrated by the significantly longer median survival of patients treated since 1981 compared with those treated earlier, even after accounting for the pretreatment prognostic factors, and by the significant improvement in survival of patients achieving remission using the \"landmark\" analysis technique.\r"

Sucralfate at 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg significantly reduced gastric ulceration. Intragastric administration of sucralfate increased luminal mucus and prostaglandin E2 levels but did not affect prostaglandin or mucus synthesis in gastric mucosal biopsy specimens from sucralfate-treated animals. Pretreatment with indomethacin partially reduced the protective effect of sucralfate. However, sucralfate 200 mg/kg, a dose that completely prevented ulceration, did not increase the levels of luminal prostaglandin E2. In vitro incubation with sucralfate did not stimulate mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. Longer-term administration of sucralfate for 48 or 96 hours did not stimulate mucus or prostaglandin synthesis but did increase luminal prostaglandin E2 and mucus. Although sucralfate increased the gastric juice content of prostaglandin E2 and mucus, the two did not appear to be mechanistically related, and only mucus release was consistently associated with mucosal protection.\r"

  ".W": "Rats pretreated with dilute ethanol, dilute hydrochloric acid, or dilute sodium hydroxide had significantly less gastric mucosal damage when they were exposed 15 or 30 minutes later to strong irritants. The dilute agents, known as mild irritants, also caused an increase in the production of gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 at the 15- and 30-minute dosing intervals. This suggests that the mild irritants are only effective in providing gastric mucosal protection when they increase gastric production of prostaglandin E2. Sucralfate treatment also caused an increase in gastric mucosal production of prostaglandin E2 at only the 15- and 30-minute dosing intervals. In contrast, pretreatment with sucralfate protected against the damaging effects of the strong irritants for at least 480 minutes. Therefore, prostaglandin E2 may play a role in sucralfate's protective effect at short dosing intervals, but at longer intervals, when prostaglandin E2 changes were not observed, sucralfate was still found to be very effective in reducing the severity of gastritis. This suggests that sucralfate acts, at least in part, through some other mechanism(s) besides increasing gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 production.\r"

In addition, DA may potentially influence renal function by occupation of DA-2 receptor subtypes. This study was designed to examine the hemodynamic and/or tubular mechanisms of the natriuretic effect of DA-1 in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. The intrarenal infusion of the DA-1 agonist, SKF 82526 (10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7) M), resulted in dose related increases in RBF and absolute and fractional sodium excretion. These changes were not associated with alterations in urinary prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha, or kallikrein excretion. To determine the role of RBF in the natriuresis due to SKF 82526 infusion (10(-7) M), the renal artery was constricted to return RBF to control levels during continued SKF 82526 infusion. Although absolute and fractional sodium excretion decreased during this maneuver, they remained higher than control. These studies support both a hemodynamic and a tubular mechanism for the natriuretic effect of the DA-1 agonist, SKF 82526. These effects do not appear to be mediated by the renal prostaglandin or kallikrein systems.\r"

Patients from all five pedigrees demonstrated markedly reduced choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex, with less severe changes in the hippocampus.

  ".W": "The Western blot and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) appear to be the most specific tests available for the detection of antibodies directed against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An investigation of 678 HIV-seropositive samples from 518 patients by the Western blot assay indicates that the majority of patients who have been exposed to HIV exhibit antibodies directed against glycoprotein (gp) 41. The HIV-seropositive samples were categorized into four groups according to their Western blot antibody reactive patterns. Group 1 had evidence of reactivities directed against protein (p) 24 and gp41; group 2 had reactivity to gp41 and no reactivity to p24; group 3 had reactivity to p24 and p55 and no reactivity to gp41; and group 4 had an isolated p24 reactivity. The RIPA revealed antibody reactivities directed against HIV envelope proteins (gp 160, gp 120, and gp41) in 91 of 95 samples that were tested. No HIV antibody reactivities were detected by RIPA in four samples from group 4. Specimens exhibiting an isolated antibody reactivity directed against p24 by Western blot analysis should have further evaluation before being labeled as indicative of HIV exposure. A western blot study on a subsequent sequential sample or another confirmatory assay, such as the RIPA, should be performed to identify antibodies directed against HIV envelope components.\r"

Large numbers of lymphoid cells reacting with anti-pan T cell (Leu-4) and anti-T helper/inducer (Leu-3a) subsets were observed around and within sarcoid granulomas. Only rare T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (Leu-2a) were observed. B lymphocytes and plasma cells were present in a few foci. Within the granuloma, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelioid cells showed membrane labeling for interleukin 2 receptors and interferon gamma. We demonstrate the in vivo expression of interleukin 2 receptors and the release of interferon gamma by mononuclear phagocytes and T lymphocytes in ocular sarcoidosis, and we theorize about the activated T helper cell-derived lymphokines in macrophage activation and sarcoid granuloma formation in the eye.\r"

Viral content was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay sensitive to 50 ng viral protein. Both HTLV-I and HIV coeluted with unbound protein.

The abnormality was clonal in all three patients and was always accompanied by either a standard or variant 9;22 translocation resulting in a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). In two cases, the t(3;21) was the only abnormality other than a t(9;22) in the primary clone. Serial studies of one patient demonstrated that the t(3;21) occurred as a result of clonal evolution near the time of development of the blast phase. We have not observed the t(3;21) in greater than 500 patients with CML in the chronic phase. Thus, the t(3;21) is a new recurring cytogenetic abnormality associated with the blast phase of CML.\r"

Because of this poor prognosis and the presence of the Ph chromosome, we have asked whether or not Ph + ALL involves a multipotential stem cell. We cultured hematopoietic progenitors from two children with Ph+ ALL and examined individual BFU-E and CFU-GM colonies for the Ph chromosome. We studied cells from two patients after 18 to 34 months of first complete clinical remission; direct cytogenetic analyses showed 26% and 13% Ph+ metaphases in these patients' marrow cells. BFU-E colonies were obtained from light density marrow cells cultured in methylcellulose supplemented with erythropoietin and CFU-GM colonies from agar or methylcellulose cultures stimulated with leukocyte feeder layers. Fifty-seven G-banded metaphases were recovered from 33 colonies. Ten metaphases from seven colonies were Ph+. Ph+ metaphases were found in three of 12 and three of five BFU-E colonies from the two patients. One of 16 CFU-GM colonies from one patient had the Ph+ chromosome; analyzable metaphases were not obtained from CFU-GM of the other patient. No colonies contained both Ph+ and Ph- cells. These results indicate that Ph+ ALL with persistence of Ph+ cells in remission involves a multipotential stem cell for erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage as well as lymphoid lineages. Multipotential stem cell involvement in the pathogenesis of some childhood Ph+ ALL suggests similarities to Ph+ chronic myelocytic leukemia and may contribute to the poor prognosis of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "At diagnosis peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow from patients with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) have shown two reproducible abnormalities when studied in cell culture: impaired growth of normal hematopoietic progenitors and excessive proliferation of malignant monocyte-macrophage elements. We used these findings to assess quality of treatment response by serially studying PB specimens from four JCML patients (patients 5, 7, 8, and 9) in complete chemotherapy-induced remission. PB readily yielded high numbers of monocyte-macrophage colonies in CFU-C and CFU-GEMM assays when cultured in early remission, and the colonies were cytogenetically proven to have arisen from a malignant clone in patient 9. When studied later in remission, the abnormal cell proliferation persisted in three of the four patients, but in patient 8 PB colony growth resembled controls. Similarly, when PB from patient 8 was studied in liquid culture without using added growth factor, cell proliferation declined identical to controls, whereas PB from the other three patients showed exuberant growth of monocyte-macrophage elements. Patient 8 successfully completed therapy and has been in a long-term, disease-free remission. The other three had recurrent, ultimately fatal disease. The cell cultures have allowed detection of residual abnormal cells that circulate in PB of JCML patients in remission. Although patient numbers were small because of the rarity of JCML, the data suggested that persistence of leukemia cells in these patients had a bearing on clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To stimulate a leukemia remission marrow, cell suspensions of normal human bone marrow were mixed with human acute lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemic cells of the CCRF-SF, Nalm-6, and K-562 lines. The cell mixtures were incubated in vitro with mafosfamide (AZ) or with the photoreactive dye merocyanine 540 (MC-540). A quantity of 10(4) cells of the treated suspensions was dispensed into microculture plates, and graded cell numbers of the line used to contaminate the normal marrow were added. Limiting-dilution analysis was used to estimate the frequency of leukemia cells persisting after treatment with the decontaminating agents. Treatment with AZ or MC-540 produced a total elimination (ie, 6 logs or 5.3 logs respectively) of B cell acute leukemia cells (CCRF-SB), whereas nearly 1.7 logs and 2 logs of K-562 acute myelogenous blasts were still present in the cell mixtures after treatment with MC-540 and AZ, respectively. Treatment of the Nalm-6-contaminated cell mixtures with AZ resulted in 100% elimination of clonogenic cells, whereas nearly 80% decontamination was obtained with MC-540. Our results suggest that treatment with AZ could be an effective method of eliminating clonogenic tumor cells from human bone marrow. MC-540, shown by previous studies to spare sufficient pluripotential stem cells to ensure hemopoietic reconstitution in the murine model and in clinical application, has comparable effects and merits trials for possible clinical use in autologous bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "In the presence of suboptimal inducing amounts of dimethylsulfoxide or hexamethylenebisacetamide, a major proportion of uncommitted murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells was found to be precommitted or primed for commitment, which was demonstrated by their rapid commitment to terminal differentiation when recultured for short periods of time (three to six hours) with fresh inducer. These same cells did not commit if left in the original inducer-containing media or if replated in fresh media without inducer. The two inducers could be interchanged in the priming and postpriming period without affecting the commitment event. However, hemin, an agent that induces hemoglobin synthesis without commitment, showed no ability to enhance commitment of a primed cell population. The rapid commitment of primed cells was inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and cordycepin but not by cycloheximide. The latter finding indicated that this rapid inducer-dependent commitment event required new RNA synthesis but not new protein synthesis. The precommitment state was lost within six hours of the growth of cells in the absence of inducer but could be sustained longer if cells were incubated in cycloheximide. These studies characterize a precommitment state not previously described and one that appears during chemically induced differentiation in the absence of metabolic inhibitors. The stabilization of these precommitted cells by cycloheximide suggests that the reversibility of precommitment involves new protein synthesis. These findings show that MEL cells proceed to terminal differentiation by accumulating unstable products that must be maintained by the inducer until the final commitment event.\r"

Although a similar chromosome rearrangement has previously been reported in five patients, including three with AML and two with CML, the 7p breakpoint in some of these cases was slightly different from that detected in our patients. Notable cytogenetic and clinicohematologic findings in our patients and those reported in the literature were as follows: (a) t(7;11) occurred in myeloid leukemia, predominantly AML with subtype M2, and occasionally in other AML subtypes and in CML with or without Ph1 chromosome; (b) t(7;11) frequently occurred as the sole chromosome abnormality; (c) most patients showed a low neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score; and (d) Auer rods were present in leukemic cells of most cases including Ph1-positive CML. Our findings suggest that a t(7;11)-associated leukemia constitutes a subgroup of myeloid malignancy involving maturing leukemic cells.\r"

  ".W": "In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) leads to the formation of a chimeric transcriptional unit carrying both c-abl and bcr genetic information whose transcript is a new fused mRNA of 8.5-kilobases (kb) and whose translational product is a 210-kD phosphoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Twenty patients affected by Ph1-positive CML were studied by Southern blot analysis with bcr. Unexpectedly, in three Ph1-positive patients, the breakpoint of chromosome 22 was located neither inside the bcr region nor 5' to it. Northern blot analysis of the RNAs of two of these patients showed the absence of a detectable 8.5-kb chimeric mRNA. In the third patient a chimeric mRNA was detected by a c-abl cDNA probe but failed to hybridize with a bcr cDNA probe and showed very low hybridization levels with further 5' bcr cDNA probes. The possibility is raised that in CML a breakpoint outside bcr might either still allow the formation of a chimeric mRNA, possibly through alternative splicing mechanisms, or might prevent the transcription of the chimera. In the latter case different molecular events resulting in the formation of a Ph1 chromosome may underlie the same myeloid neoplastic phenotype.\r"

This cell line, designated TMM, consists of immature cells with the morphological characteristics of young myeloblasts and grows in suspension culture with a doubling time of about 30 hours. By cytochemical analysis the cultured cells were positive for acid phosphatase. They were free of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Further phenotypic analysis revealed the expression of the myelomonocytic-specific antigen Leu-M1 and receptors for the Fc portion of IgG. Partial differentiation of these cells could be induced by dimethyl sulfoxide, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, or hypoxanthine and resulted in cells of the myeloid series expressing lysozyme and receptors for the C3b complement protein. The karyotype was 46,XY, lacked the Ph1 chromosome, and displayed no abnormalities at the light microscopic level. No rearrangement of the bcr-c-abl gene complex was found. This cell line should be useful for studying an important type of the heterogeneous population constituting Ph1-negative myeloblastic leukemia, arising in this instance from MDS, as well as for studying differentiation and proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells.\r"

This study assesses the value of serum CA 19-9 assay in the postsurgical follow-up of patients undergoing pancreatic cancer resection. In 14 patients with cancer in the head of the pancreas and abnormal preoperative serum CA 19-9 values (greater than 40 U/ml), a pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. In all patients the CA 19-9 antigen was immunohistochemically demonstrated on the removed tumoral tissue. Postoperative serum CA 19-9 concentrations were serially measured 15 days after surgery and then every other month. Serum CA 19-9 scores returned to the normal range only in 7 (50%) of the resected patients. All patients with a normal postoperative value and none of those with a persistently elevated one survived longer than 7 months. Early postoperative serum CA 19-9 assay was superior to perioperative staging of the tumor as a prognostic index. All of the seven patients with postoperative normal values exhibited a subsequent increase within 16 months. In all cases the elevation of CA 19-9 occurred at least 2 months before ultrasound (US) could detect local recurrences of hepatic metastasis. Our data indicate that a normal early postoperative CA 19-9 score is a relatively favourable prognostic index in patients who undergo radical surgery for pancreatic cancer and that the CA 19-9 test can be used, as an early marker of recurrence, in monitoring these patients.\r"

In contrast, pre-operative serum CA 125 levels were elevated in almost all of the patients with malignant ovarian tumors but not in most of those with benign ovarian tumors. These findings suggest that in benign ovarian tumors there is an effective barrier between the cyst fluid and the circulation that prevents the appearance of CA 125 in the serum, whereas in malignant tumors infiltrative growth leads to the release of antigen into the circulation. Furthermore, CA 125 values in ascites fluids were up to 130 times higher than the serum antigen levels, which indicates that the peritoneum serves as a barrier for high molecular weight tumor antigens. The current results show that tumor basement membranes and peritoneal barriers play a notable role in the transit of tumor antigens, one which must be taken into account in the monitoring of serum marker levels of cancer patients.\r"

Eleven of 26 large cell lymphoma patients with adequate follow-up were long-term survivors (free of disease for more than 5 years). Nineteen of the 33 large cell lymphomas were localized to one bone. The stage and histologic pattern significantly correlated with long-term survival among large cell lymphomas. Seventy-three percent of patients with localized lymphoma were long-term survivors, in contrast to 9% of those with disseminated disease. Sixty-seven percent of patients with large cleaved and multilobated cell lymphoma were long-term survivors, but only 21% of those with large noncleaved cell and immunoblastic sarcoma were. The tumors had a blastic, lytic, or mixed radiographic appearance and had either sclerotic, lytic, or permeative borders; none of the radiologic findings were diagnostically useful.\r"

Learned food aversions (LFA) were documented via open-ended questionnaires and ratings for foods ingested during the 48-hour period surrounding the first day of treatment. Treatment-related aversions were observed in over 50% of the patients and involved all food groups. The aversions generally occurred shortly after the first course of chemotherapy, were food-specific and of short duration. No strong association was observed between the incidence of food aversions and treatment outcome measures, but quality of life issues warrant further consideration.\r"

The cisplatin-treated rats developed a pronounced polyuria which did not recover during an 18 week observation period. 2. After 21 weeks, one group of the cisplatin-treated animals received a 6 h infusion of 2.5% D-glucose. Vasopressin (60 mu-units min-1 100 g-1 body weight) was incorporated into the infusate for the final 2 h. A control group of animals received an identical infusion. One week later the other group of cisplatin-treated rats received a 6 h infusion of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. Indomethacin was incorporated into the infusate for 15 min, at 3 h 52.5 min, to deliver a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. A control group again received an identical infusion. 3. Cisplatin did not impair the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin, but it reduced the natriuretic effect of vasopressin, and also impaired the ability of the animals to produce concentrated urine. 4. Cisplatin did not alter basal PGE2 excretion, or the reduction in PGE2 excretion induced by indomethacin. However, the urine flow in the cisplatin-treated group did not fall after indomethacin, whereas there was a fall in urine flow in the control group.\r"

In order to explore the involvement of endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the urine concentration defect after ureteral occlusion, PGE2 production by isolated collecting ducts in vitro and effects of indomethacin on urine osmolality in vivo were examined. 2. Twenty-four hours ureter obstruction caused increased PGE2 production by the medullary collecting ducts, which was maintained at a high level on the day after release of obstruction (0.8 +/- 0.2 pg/mm normal, 8.1 +/- 0.9 pg/mm 24 h obstruction, and 6.6 +/- 1.0 pg/mm post-obstruction, mean +/- SEM). An enhanced PGE2 production was also observed for papillary collecting duct on the day after release of 24 h ureteral occlusion (3.9 +/- 0.5 pg/mm normal and 7.7 +/- 1.2 pg/mm post-obstruction). 3. Administration of indomethacin to the unilateral post-obstructive rats slightly raised the urine osmolality of the post-obstructed kidney (from 339 +/- 17 to 390 +/- 22 mosmol/kg H2O), while it had a greater effect on the contralateral intact kidney (from 1569 +/- 138 to 2567 +/- 198 mosmol/kg H2O). 4. Our data may indicate that the urine concentration defect after 24 h ureteral occlusion is ascribable mainly to a mechanism other than increased endogenous PGE2.\r"

  ".U": "88029261\r", 
  ".W": "A group of electron-dense granules of 150-300 nm in diameter, with a single limiting membrane, were found adjacent to the nuclei of large (25-50 microns in diameter), but not small (15-22 microns), bovine luteal cells of pregnancy. These granules were quite heterogeneous with respect to size, shape, content, etc. Most granules contained varying amounts of light and dark electron-dense material, and very few contained only light or dark material in their core. These granules occupied 160.4 +/- 7.8 microns3 cytoplasmic volume, which did not significantly decrease until 2 h of incubation without any hormone at 22 or 38 C (P greater than 0.05). Subsequently, however, volume occupancy of these granules decreased to 127.3 +/- 6.4 and 117.6 +/- 8.0 microns3 (P less than 0.05) by 4 and 12 h of incubation, respectively. Incubation of luteal tissue with 10 nM prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), on the other hand, resulted in a decrease to 124.4 +/- 8.0 microns3 of volume occupancy of granules by 10 min (P less than 0.05). The volume occupancy further decreased to 46.2 +/- 4.8 microns3 by 2 h (P less than 0.01), and then the granules virtually disappeared from luteal cells. While PGF2 alpha decreased volume occupancy of granules similarly at 22 and 38 C, it had no effect at 4 C. PGF2 alpha decreased volume occupancy of granules at 0.01 nM (P less than 0.05), which continued to decrease with increasing PGF2 alpha concentrations, reaching a maximal decrease at 10 nM PGF2 alpha (P less than 0.05). PGE1, hCG, human LH, human PRL, or (Bu)2cAMP had no effect on the granules, suggesting that the PGF2 alpha effect was hormone specific. PGE1 and hCG, which protect corpus luteum from the luteolytic action of PGF2 alpha, could not inhibit degranulation by PGF2 alpha. These results demonstrate that treatment with PGF2 alpha in vitro results in a decrease in volume occupancy of nuclear associated granules in bovine large luteal cells of pregnancy in a time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and hormone-specific manner.\r"

Eicosanoid generation, in addition to complement fragment formation, may be a valuable indicator of the biocompatibility of dialyzer membranes. In the present in vitro study, eicosanoid generation induced by several different flat dialyzer membranes [polyacrylonitrile (PAN), cuprammonium cellulose (CC), and polycarbonate (PC)] was evaluated and compared using blood from non-uremic healthy volunteers. Generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) was greatest with PC followed by PAN and CC. The formation of C3a des arg with PAN was less than with either CC or PC. Our results suggest that dialyzer membranes affect complement activation and eicosanoid generation differently; biocompatibility as expressed by a low level of complement fragment formation does not necessarily translate into biocompatibility when considering eicosanoid generation.\r"

Complete and prolonged control of GH secretion was obtained with a 600-micrograms daily continuous sc infusion (CSI), and the patient was treated in this way for 6 months. Rapid improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly occurred, as did major tumor shrinkage. The other pituitary functions did not change. After 6 months, the daily SMS 201-995 dose was progressively reduced; GH secretion remained suppressed. After 12 months of treatment, GH secretion was controlled with a CSI of 100 micrograms SMS 201-995 daily, but not with two daily sc 100-micrograms injections. Further significant reduction in tumor size occurred. We conclude that CSI of SMS 201-995 resulted in constant GH normalization and marked clinical and morphological improvement.

Age at onset was from 20 to 70 years (mean, 43 years; median, 42 years). Duration of disease was from 1 to 30 years (mean, 119 months; median 161 months). Seven patients also had parapsoriasis en plaque or plaque-stage mycosis fungoides at the time of diagnosis and one patient had erythroderma. None of the 22 uncomplicated lymphomatoid papulosis patients developed malignant cutaneous lymphoma during the period of observation, while the remaining 8 patients who had concurrent parapsoriasis en plaque, mycosis fungoides, or erythroderma did not deteriorate further. Single-cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) measurements on the dermal infiltrate were done in 13 patients and were abnormal in 7 patients. Two of these had greatly abnormal DNA histograms and at the same time an abnormal clinical presentation with multiple nodules and tumors. The remaining five patients had DNA histograms that indicated a potential for malignancy. Monoclonal antibody studies were performed on skin biopsy specimens of 10 patients. The dermal infiltrate was dominated by T-helper lymphocytes and some Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells could be detected by the antibodies Ki-1, Ki-24, and Ki-27. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies were found in 3 of 18 patients examined. Treatment with psoralens plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) was effective (partial or complete remission) in six patients but they relapsed at cessation of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four class II alpha subunits designated 28-1 alpha, 37-68 alpha, 42-20 alpha, and 38-27 alpha and five class II beta subunits designated 28-1 beta, 37-68 beta 1, 37-68 beta 2, 42-20 beta, and 38-27 beta were compared by N-terminal sequence analyses. Two distinct alpha subunits were identified; the 28-1 alpha, 37-68 alpha, and 42-20 alpha subunits all had identical N-terminal amino acids sequences, which exhibited about 75% homology with HLA-DR alpha and mouse E alpha polypeptides. In contrast, the 38-27 alpha sequence exhibited about 80% sequence homology with HLA-DQ alpha and mouse A alpha polypeptides. In general, sheep beta subunits displayed insufficient sequence homology to enable correlation with human beta-chain sequences; however, the 38-27 beta-chain sequence showed homology with the HLA-DQ beta sequence. The conserved sequence surrounding the site for N-linked glycosylation within human/mouse beta polypeptides (residues 19 to 21) was not present in sheep beta sequences and in contrast with the beta-chains of mouse and man, sheep beta polypeptides contained between 1 and 3 positionally variable cysteine residues (residues 13 to 15 inclusive). Individual sheep beta subunits exhibited extensive sequence heterogeneity and each consisted of a unique population of beta polypeptide species. At least 16 different beta polypeptide sequences were identified from a single sheep and the existence of no fewer than nine non-allelic beta genes was inferred from the sequence data. We have previously provided evidence suggesting that the sheep has multiple major histocompatibility complex class II alpha and beta genes related to those of all three HLA-D subregions. The present results suggest that a number of these genes encode HLA-DQ-like heterodimers and that a sheep DR-like alpha gene product is shared with the products of a large and heterogeneous sheep beta gene family.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies of human lung and intestinal mast cells failed to show the heterogeneity found among mast cells in murine species. Recently, we and others have developed techniques for the enzymatic dispersion of human neonatal skin mast cells. In addition, we are now able to make single cell suspensions of mast cells from adult skin and to purify these cells to near homogeneity. Comparative studies of mast cells from these several sources have uncovered several major differences among them. Adult and neonatal skin mast cells themselves differ in that the former are 10-fold less sensitive to goat anti-human IgE, with maximal release occurring at 3.0 and 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Skin mast cells also differ in optimal temperature for release: adult mast cells respond maximally at 23 to 30 degrees C and neonatal cells at 37 degrees C. Skin mast cells from both sources are dramatically different from lung and intestinal mast cells in two aspects. First, skin mast cells are quite responsive to several stimuli--morphine sulfate (10(-4) to 10(-6) M), substance P (10(-5) to 10(-7) M), compound 48/80 (10 to 0.1 microgram/ml), f-Met peptide (10(-6) M), and C5a (10(-8) M)--to which the other mast cells fail to respond. Second, although stimulated skin mast cells produce prostaglandin D2, little leikotriene C4, if any, is generated, unlike lung or intestinal mast cells. These differences in inflammatory potential among human mast cells from various sites have important implications for the management of allergic and inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".U": "88034483\r", 
  ".W": "Two kinds of keratin-hydrolyzing enzymes (KHEs) from cow snout epithelium were highly purified by affinity chromatography using soybean trypsin inhibitor-bound Sepharose. On gel filtration chromatography, the KHEs were eluted at a volume corresponding to a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 21,000. They were separated from each other by ion exchange chromatography. One of the enzymes had the same characteristics as urea extracted alkaline proteinase, of which optimal pH was at 8.5 to 9.0. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed a single band with Mr of 21,500 in the presence or absence of a reducing agent. The other enzyme was a neutral proteinase, with an optimal pH of 7.5. Both enzymes were inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Among the fluorogenic peptides that were hydrolyzed most effectively by the alkaline proteinase were peptidyl MCAs (4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amides) with extended sequences, Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA, and then Boc-Val-Pro-ARg-MCA. The neutral proteinase hydrolyzed the latter most effectively. They hydrolyzed preferentially high Mr keratins of cow snout and of newborn mouse epidermis, and showed a limited proteolysis toward 68,000 polypeptide, giving rise to distinct products. The high substrate specificity and extended subsites of the KHEs suggest their role on the metabolism of the high Mr keratins.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) cause epidermal inflammation and hyperplasia similar to that observed in psoriasis. Recent evidence suggests that these effects are mediated by a calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), which is quantitatively the major cellular phorbol ester receptor. This report describes the partial purification and biochemical properties of this enzyme from adult human epidermis. Protein kinase C activity was purified 30-fold from high speed supernatants prepared from homogenates of keratome biopsies obtained from healthy volunteers. The partially purified preparation had a specific activity of 1.2 nmol/min/mg protein and an apparent molecular weight of 79,400. Activity was dependent on the presence of calcium and phosphatidylserine. At low calcium concentration (less than 0.1 mM) activity was greatly stimulated by 1,2-dioleoylglycerol. TPA mimicked the effect of diglyceride on enzyme activity, and the partially purified enzyme specifically bound phorbol dibutyrate (Kd = 2 nM). Protein kinase C activity was also present in the membrane fraction from adult human epidermis, and possessed properties similar to those of the cytosolic enzyme. We conclude that protein kinase C is present in human epidermis and is activated by TPA in a manner similar to that described for this enzyme from other tissues. These data lay the foundation for studying the role of protein kinase C in the regulation of epidermal growth and maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier experiments from our laboratory revealed that the medication most commonly used for depigmenting patients with vitiligo, monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone (MBEH), when applied to the skin of DBA/2 mice caused an increase in the population density (cells/mm2) of identifiable Ia+ and ATPase+ Langerhans cells. Further, this increase in Langerhans cell density could be correlated with an increase of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reactivity to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). The current experiments demonstrated that other compounds chemically similar to MBEH, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which are used as preservatives/antioxidants in many topical medications, cosmetics, food, and rubber products, can in five days significantly increase the population density of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells. These compounds had no effects on Ia+ cells. This observation suggests that the Thy-1+ DEC cells may be more mobile and/or their surface markers may be readily expressed and are not a slowly mobile (trafficking) population of cells as suggested by the results of previous work. In addition, these parasubstituted phenolic compounds behaved like pertussis toxin and induced Thy-1 and Ia expression on keratinocytes. These changes in Thy-1 immune markers were not accompanied by functional alterations in the immune response to contact allergens as measured by the ear swelling technique.\r"

  ".W": "We have initiated a series of studies in vivo to investigate the physiologic role of Langerhans cells and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells in the development and regulation of contact hypersensitivity. The density of I-A+ Langerhans cells and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells in ammonium thiocyanate-separated epidermal sheets was determined in ten strains of inbred mice using immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal anti-I-A and anti-Thy-1 antibodies. Mice of different inbred strains were sensitized by painting the left ear with varying doses of either oxazolone or trinitrochlorobenzene. From five to 20 days after sensitization, groups of mice were challenged with the relevant antigen and the intensity of contact hypersensitivity, as measured by ear swelling, was determined. We then determined whether the intensity and/or duration of contact hypersensitivity in different strains of mice was influenced by the density of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells or the ratio of I-A+ Langerhans cells to Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells. We found that there was marked variability in the density of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells and I-A+ Langerhans cells in the ten strains of mice studied. The ratio of I-A+ Langerhans cells to Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells ranged from 0.5 in C57BL/10J mice to greater than 22 in A/J and BALB/cByJ mice. When small amounts of contact sensitizers were used to induce contact hypersensitivity (e.g., 20 micrograms of oxazolone or trinitrochlorobenzene), there was consistent strain variability in the intensity of ear swelling. There was a significant correlation between the ratio of I-A+ Langerhans cells to Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells and the intensity of contact hypersensitivity (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.85, p = 0.002). Strains with the highest ratios of I-A+ Langerhans cells to Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells had the most ear swelling. There were no consistent differences in the duration of contact hypersensitivity observed among the ten different strains. Our results indicate that Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells may play a physiologic role in down-regulating contact hypersensitivity in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Transferrin is a serum glycoprotein which contains four sialic acid residues located at the end of two branched carbohydrate structures. The presence of these four acidic residues influences the electrophoretic mobility of the transferrin molecule. Alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of transferrin may be encountered in forensic science case work, particularly in association with postmortem samples. These altered transferrins usually appear in a highly stylized \"ladder\" banding pattern. To determine whether these altered transferrins are the result of sialic acid removal, serum samples of known transferrin type were treated with neuraminidase. These experiments support the hypothesis that the \"ladder\" banding pattern of transferrin observed in some case samples is due to the removal of sialic acid residues by bacterial or endogenous neuraminidase. These studies also demonstrate that partially desialidated transferrin variants cannot be clearly typed until the sialic acid is completely stripped from the transferrin molecule. Reliable typing of partially desialidated samples can be accomplished by treating these samples with neuraminidase.\r"
