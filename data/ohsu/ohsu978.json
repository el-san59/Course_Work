Brief air-puff and electrical stimuli were applied to the tip of the index finger in separate trials and SNAPs from the median nerve at the wrist and SEPs from the scalp were recorded for each stimulus presentation. Air-puff evoked SNAPs were polyphasic, usually consisting of 2 to 4 separate waves, unlike triphasic activity elicited by electrical stimulation. The SEPs produced by these 2 distinct forms of inputs, however, were similar in morphology. The latencies of the initial components of SNAPs and SEPs were longer for air-puff stimulation. The conduction time, however, of the fastest afferent volleys from the wrist to cortex was not significantly different for air-puff (20.52 +/- 1.06 ms, mean +/- SD) and electrical stimulation (20.17 +/- 0.66 ms). It is therefore concluded that the latency delays for air-puff evoked SNAPs and SEPs are due solely to a transduction time at the skin receptors and not due to differences in conduction velocities as suggested in the previous literature.\r"

  ".W": "We recorded isometric and isotonic twitches, in situ, from the cat soleus at various muscle lengths and temperatures. At a given temperature the duration of isometric twitches increased approximately 60% for each 10% increase in muscle length, which was primarily owing to decreases in the rate of relaxation. For the relaxation of isometric twitches recorded at different muscle lengths, the equivalent activation energies determined were the same (13.2 +/- 0.3 kcal/M). The duration of isotonic twitch contractions increased only 20% for each 10% increase in muscle length. Even a small amount of shortening (3%) diminished the dependence of twitch duration on muscle length. In this case, twitch duration increased approximately 30% for every 10% increase in muscle length. Hence, even small changes in internal and/or external compliance (eg, changes in the tendon-fiber continuity) can greatly influence twitch duration. Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that in the cat soleus, Ca2+ sequestration is primarily governed by a single energy dependent process and that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus increases with increasing sarcomere length.\r"

The findings were distinctly different in the two groups. The electrodiagnostic studies of all the MAG-reactive patients had demyelinating features with slowing of conduction and prolonged distal latencies while only one of the MAG-nonreactive patients had a demyelinating pattern. In fact, the MAG-nonreactive patients were a heterogeneous group, both electrodiagnostically and clinically. This study supports the concept that MAG-reactive polyneuropathy is demyelinating in type, and is caused by the activity of the IgM M-protein directed at an antigen in the myelin sheath.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of low extracellular calcium and calcium antagonists on skeletal muscle staircase and fatigue. Initial experiments revealed that, brief exposure (10 minutes) of single frog sartorius muscle to diltiazem, D-600 (5 and 30 microM) and low calcium Ringer's solution (LCR, calcium replaced by magnesium and EGTA) had little effect on isometric twitches evoked every 30 seconds. However, when stimulated at 1 per second for 15 minutes, the calcium antagonists significantly decreased the magnitude and time course of the staircase, whereas LCR decreased only the time course. Each experimental condition significantly increased the rate of fatigue while diltiazem and D-600 both increased the magnitude of fatigue. Following the stimulation period, caffeine (10 mM) elicited contractures from all muscles whereas high potassium (180 mM) elicited contractures from control muscles only. These results indicate that calcium channel antagonists depress the skeletal muscle staircase response. They also indicate that these compounds as well as LCR enhance the fatigue process. Extracellular calcium influx may therefore have some influence on skeletal muscle twitches during prolonged repetitive activity.\r"

Cervical root excitation can be carried out by electrical or magnetic stimulation. The F wave technique also produces reliable results. Electrical stimulation of lumbar roots produces the most reliable results when measuring CMCT to leg muscles. CMCT to the tibialis anterior correlates with height, but not with age or sex. The same is true for intraspinal motor conduction time. Contraction of the target muscle enlarges CMAP amplitudes after cervical and transcranial stimulation. However, a latency shortening is only seen after brain stimulation. This is thought to be at least partially due to spatial summation of D and I waves. Age affects peripheral nerve conduction and central nerve conduction in different ways.\r"

  ".W": "The spatial distribution of muscle fibers belonging to a motor unit was studied in the soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) of adult cats to provide a detailed description of the spatial patterns which exist within the territory of a motor unit. Glycogen depletion of the motor unit was achieved through repetitive stimulation of either the intracellularly identified motoneuron or the functionally isolated motor axon. Muscle fibers belonging to the stimulated unit were identified in serial cross-sections, and in the cross-section which contained the most depleted fibers the centroid of each depleted fiber was determined. Subsequently, three spatial analyses, ie, a quadrat analysis, a point-to nearest neighbor analysis and an interfiber distance analysis, were used to determine if motor unit fibers were distributed randomly throughout the territory of the unit. Motor unit fibers tended to be localized within the muscle cross-section and were not evenly or homogeneously distributed throughout the territory. In general, the analyses suggested that motor unit fibers may be arranged in clusters or subgroups of varying size. The data demonstrate three different quantitative analyses for studying the organization of muscle fibers of normal motor units, which can be used for objective assessment and diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.\r"

After MVC, the number of motor unit spikes/second needed to maintain this posture was about 50% less than prior to MVC. Surface rectified integrated EMG activity declined in parallel to the decline in spike counts. To determine whether different muscles were compensating for the reduction in spike counts, synergistic muscles were examined simultaneously. Similar reductions were noted. In one deafferented subject, EMG activity increased rather than decreased after MVC . Fatigue decreases the contraction-relaxation rate of muscle fibers, which lowers fusion frequency. Thus, lower rates of motor unit activation can result in the maintenance of constant force. A feedback system from muscle to CNS likely senses this slowing and leads to the spike count reduction.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed. Mazindol doses not slow the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy.\r"

Negative electrical forces recorded with three orthodiagonal bipolar electrodes in the neck had a direction opposite to that of impulse conduction in the proximal peripheral and cervical somatosensory pathway. Sequential tracings of vectors opposite the electrical forces were made in three-dimensional display, thus reproducing the actual time sequence of electrical events in those structures. Fixed generators such as the subcortical nuclei were also analyzed with this technique, and multiple generators of N13 potential (N13a and N13b) were visualized. This technique may be useful in the functional evaluation of the somatosensory pathway in the cervical cord.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Severe plaque-type psoriasis has been successfully treated with orally administered cyclosporine, but there has been no comparative, controlled evaluation of various dosages and their efficacy and side effects. METHODS. In a 16-week, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 85 patients with severe psoriasis to receive 3, 5, or 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram of body weight per day or a placebo consisting of the vehicle for the drug. After eight weeks the dose could be adjusted to improve safety or efficacy while maintaining blinding. RESULTS. The psoriasis improved in a dose-dependent fashion. After eight weeks of fixed-dose therapy, 36, 65, and 80 percent of the patients receiving 3, 5, and 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram per day, respectively, were rated as being clear or almost clear of psoriasis; each group had significant improvement (P less than 0.0001) as compared with the group receiving vehicle, in which none of the patients were rated as clear or almost clear. The patients who received 5 mg per kilogram were the least likely to require dosage adjustments because of side effects or a lack of efficacy. The glomerular filtration rate, measured in a subgroup of 34 patients receiving cyclosporine, decreased by a median of 16 percent. Higher doses of cyclosporine had greater adverse effects on systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and serum levels of creatinine, uric acid, bilirubin, and cholesterol. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to skin-test antigens were reduced by cyclosporine administration. Cyclosporine appears to become concentrated in skin. CONCLUSIONS. Cyclosporine therapy leads to a rapid and thorough clearing of psoriasis; an initial dose of 5 mg per kilogram per day seems to be appropriate. However, the safety of cyclosporine for the long-term treatment of psoriasis remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The majority of asthma-related deaths occur outside the hospital, and therefore the exact factors leading to the terminal event are difficult to ascertain. To examine the mechanisms by which patients might die during acute exacerbations of asthma, we studied 10 such patients who arrived at the hospital in respiratory arrest or in whom it developed soon (within 20 minutes) after admission. RESULTS. The characteristics of the group were similar to those associated in the literature with a high risk of death from asthma, including a long history of the disease in young to middle-aged patients, previous life-threatening attacks or hospitalizations, delay in obtaining medical aid, and sudden onset of a rapidly progressive crisis. Extreme hypercapnia (mean [+/- SD] partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, 97.1 +/- 31.1 mm Hg) and acidosis (mean [+/- SD] pH, 7.01 +/- 0.11) were found before mechanical ventilation was begun, and four patients had hypokalemia on admission. Despite the severe respiratory acidosis, no patient had a serious cardiac arrhythmia during the resuscitation maneuvers or during hospitalization. We observed systemic hypertension and sinus tachycardia in eight patients, atrial fibrillation in one, and sinus bradycardia in another. In both patients with arrhythmia the heart reverted to sinus rhythm immediately after manual ventilation with 100 percent oxygen was begun. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 12 hours, and all patients had normocapnia on discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that at least in this group of patients, the near-fatal nature of the exacerbations was the result of severe asphyxia rather than cardiac arrhythmias. These results suggest that undertreatment rather than overtreatment may contribute to an increase in mortality from asthma.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In some highly trained athletes, the thickness of the left ventricular wall may increase as a consequence of exercise training and resemble that found in cardiac diseases associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In these athletes, the differential diagnosis between physiologic and pathologic hypertrophy may be difficult. METHODS. To address this issue, we measured left ventricular dimensions with echocardiography in 947 elite, highly trained athletes who participated in a wide variety of sports. RESULTS. The thickest left ventricular wall among the athletes measured 16 mm. Wall thicknesses within a range compatible with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (greater than or equal to 13 mm) were identified in only 16 of the 947 athletes (1.7 percent); 15 were rowers or canoeists, and 1 was a cyclist. Therefore, the wall was greater than or equal to 13 mm thick in 7 percent of 219 rowers, canoeists, and cyclists but in none of 728 participants in 22 other sports. All athletes with walls greater than or equal to 13 mm thick also had enlarged left ventricular end-diastolic cavities (dimensions, 55 to 63 mm). CONCLUSIONS. On the basis of these data, a left-ventricular-wall thickness of greater than or equal to 13 mm is very uncommon in highly trained athletes, virtually confined to athletes training in rowing sports, and associated with an enlarged left ventricular cavity. In addition, the upper limit to which the thickness of the left ventricular wall may be increased by athletic training appears to be 16 mm. Therefore, athletes with a wall thickness of more than 16 mm and a nondilated left ventricular cavity are likely to have primary forms of pathologic hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

When a region in the N terminus of cyclin is fused to a foreign protein, it produces a hybrid protein susceptible to proteolysis at mitosis. During the course of degradation, both cyclin and the hybrid form conjugates with ubiquitin. The kinetic properties of the conjugates indicate that cyclin is degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Thus anaphase may be triggered by the recognition of cyclin by the ubiquitin-conjugating system.\r"

Some patients with damage to the parietal lobe, for example, are unable to reach accurately towards visual targets that they unequivocally report seeing. Conversely, some patients with extensive damage to primary visual cortex can make accurate pointing movements or saccades toward a stimulus presented in their 'blind' scotoma. But in investigations of visuomotor control in patients with visual disorders, little consideration has been given to complex acts such as manual prehension. Grasping a three-dimensional object requires knowledge not only of the object's spatial location, but also of its form, orientation and size. We have examined a patient with a profound disorder in the perception of such object qualities. Our quantitative analyses demonstrate strikingly accurate guidance of hand and finger movements directed at the very objects whose qualities she fails to perceive. These data suggest that the neural substrates for the visual perception of object qualities such as shape, orientation and size are distinct from those underlying the use of those qualities in the control of manual skills.\r"

  ".W": "Neurotransmission at most excitatory synapses in the brain operates through two types of glutamate receptor termed alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors; these mediate the fast and slow components of excitatory postsynaptic potentials respectively. Activation of NMDA receptors can also lead to a long-lasting modification in synaptic efficiency at glutamatergic synapses; this is exemplified in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where NMDA receptors mediate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). It is believed that in this region LTP is maintained by a specific increase in the AMPA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission. We now report, however, that a pharmacologically isolated NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic response can undergo robust, synapse-specific LTP. This finding has implications for neuropathologies such as epilepsy and neurodegeneration, in which excessive NMDA receptor activation has been implicated. It adds fundamentally to theories of synaptic plasticity because NMDA receptor activation may, in addition to causing increased synaptic efficiency, directly alter the plasticity of synapses.\r"

The apical influenza virus haemagglutinin was preferentially delivered to the axon of hippocampal neurons in culture, whereas the basolateral vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein was sorted to the dendrites. To investigate whether other membrane proteins showed similar sorting in neurons and epithelial cells, we have analysed the localization of a glypiated (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored) protein, Thy-1, in hippocampal neurons in culture. In MDCK and other epithelial cells, endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, as well as mutated exogenous proteins containing the GPI-attachment signal, undergo preferential delivery to the apical surface. This polarized sorting of GPI-anchored proteins has been proposed to occur by the same mechanisms as the sorting of glycolipids to the apical surface. We report here that the neuronal GPI-protein Thy-1 is present in hippocampal neurons in culture and is exclusively located on the axonal surface. This finding further strengthens our hypothesis that the mechanisms of sorting of surface components may be similar in neurons and epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil-mediated inflammation is involved in a number of human clinical manifestations, including the adult respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and reperfusion injury. One way of inhibiting this type of inflammatory response would be to block competitively the adhesive interactions between neutrophils and the endothelium adjacent to the inflamed region. The lectin-containing murine adhesion molecule gp90MEL, the homing receptor, is found on all leukocytic cells, including neutrophils. MEL 14, a monoclonal antibody directed against this adhesion molecule, blocks lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes and extravasation of neutrophils from blood to inflammatory sites. Here we show that administration to mice of a soluble immunoglobulin chimaera containing the murine homing receptor extracellular domain significantly decreases the number of neutrophils that migrate to the peritoneum in response to the inflammatory irritant thioglycollate. These results indicate that soluble forms of a single type of adhesion molecule, the homing receptor, could be clinically effective compounds for the inhibition of neutrophil-mediated inflammation.\r"

They vary in their ability to infect different cell types, to replicate rapidly and to high titre in culture, to down-modulate the CD4 receptor, and to cause cytopathic changes in infected cells. Some of these in vitro properties correlate with pathogenicity of the virus in vivo. To map the viral determinants of the cellular host range of HIV-1, recombinant viruses were generated between biologically active molecular clones of HIV-1 isolates showing differences in infection of primary peripheral blood macrophages and established T-cell lines. We report here that a specific region of the envelope gp120 gene representing 159 amino-acid residues of glycoprotein gp120 seems to determine macrophage tropism, whereas an overlapping region representing 321 amino-acid residues determines T cell-line tropism. These studies provide a basis for relating functional domains of the HIV-1 env gene to pathogenic potential.\r"

  ".U": "91095023\r", 
  ".W": "One of the profound changes in cellular morphology which occurs during mitosis is a massive alteration in the organization of the microfilament cytoskeleton. This change, together with other mitotic events including nuclear membrane breakdown, chromosome condensation and formation of mitotic spindles, is induced by a molecular complex called maturation promoting factor. This consists of at least two subunits, a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 45,000-62,000 (Mr 45-62K) known as cyclin, and a 34K catalytic subunit which has serine/threonine kinase activity and is known as cdc2 kinase. Non-muscle caldesmon, an 83K actin- and calmodulin-binding protein, is dissociated from microfilaments during mitosis, apparently as a consequence of mitosis-specific phosphorylation. We now report that cdc2 kinase phosphorylates caldesmon in vitro principally at the same sites as those phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis, and that phosphorylation reduces the binding affinity of caldesmon for both actin and calmodulin. Because caldesmon inhibits actomyosin ATPase, our results suggest that cdc2 kinase directly causes microfilament reorganization during mitosis.\r"

Although there is evidence that p60c-src is phosphorylated at several sites during mitosis, phosphorylation in vitro does not increase its kinase activity. We now report that the kinase activity of a p60c-src mutant with residue tyrosine 527 changed to phenylanine does not change during the cell cycle, suggesting that changes in the phosphorylation state of this residue may be responsible for the activation of p60c-src at mitosis. Although changes in phosphorylation at Tyr 527 cannot be detected with the wild-type protein we find that phosphorylation at Tyr 527 of a mutant with reduced kinase activity decreases threefold during mitosis. On the basis of these results we suggest that activation of p60c-src at mitosis results from decreased phosphorylation on Tyr 527, and that p60c-src may be or may activate the kinase that phosphorylates Tyr 527.\r"

  ".W": "The factor for inversion stimulation, FIS, is involved in several cellular processes, including site-specific recombination and transcriptional activation. In the reactions catalysed by the DNA invertases Gin, Hin and Cin, FIS stimulates recombination by binding to an enhancer sequence. Within the enhancer, two FIS dimers (each 2 x 98 amino acids) bind to two 15-base-pair consensus sequences and induce bending of the DNA. Current models propose that the enhancer-FIS complex organizes a specific synapse, either through direct interactions with Gin, or by modelling the substrate into a configuration suitable for recombination. Using X-ray analysis at 2.0 A resolution, we now show that FIS is composed of four alpha helices tightly intertwined to form a globular dimer with two protruding helix-turn-helix motifs. The 24 N-terminal amino acids are so poorly defined in the electron density map as to make interpretation doubtful, indicating that they might act as 'feelers' suitable for DNA or protein (invertase) recognition. We infer from model building that DNA has to bend for tight binding to FIS.\r"

Immediately after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, the chemical decay rate of bulk mRNA is slowed 2- to 3-fold, and within 70 min, precursors to 5S rRNA begin to accumulate. In addition, all of the phenotypes associated with either the rne-3071 or the ams-1 alleles were complemented by a recombinant plasmid carrying ams+.

We propose that recombination in the minichromosome system proceeds through an intermediate formed by direct hybridization of complementary sequences on displaced strands generated by adenovirus-specific DNA replication. Some, but not all, heterologous regions in the intermediate are susceptible to mismatch correction. This pathway is intrinsically nonreciprocal and differs significantly from other adenovirus recombinational mechanisms that have been described previously.\r"

Two types of abnormal genes coding for plasminogen were identified in these patients. In the type I mutation, a guanosine in GCT coding for Ala-601 near the active-site histidine was replaced by an adenosine resulting in ACT coding for threonine. This mutation was also shown by the loss of a cleavage site for Fnu4HI endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GCTGC but not ACTGC. In the type II mutation, a guanosine in GTC coding for Val-355 was replaced by a thymidine resulting in TTC coding for phenylalanine. This change was readily shown by digestion with Ava II endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GGTCC and not GTTCC. The type I mutation has been found to be identical to a plasminogen variant identified in Japanese patients by amino acid sequence analysis and also detected by isoelectric focusing, whereas the type II mutation is a unique amino acid substitution in the connecting region between the third and fourth kringles in plasminogen. DNA sequence analysis also revealed that the abnormal genes carry several silent nucleotide substitutions located primarily within introns and 5' and 3' flanking regions.\r"

We show that human rsCD4 does not efficiently inhibit SIVmac replication in bone marrow macrophages of rhesus monkeys and does not significantly augment bone marrow hematopoietic colony formation in vitro. However, plasma of human rsCD4-treated rhesus monkeys does exhibit significant anti-SIVmac activity in vitro. Plasma of these animals efficiently blocks SIVmac replication in peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow macrophages. It also increases granulocyte/macrophage colony formation in vitro by bone marrow cells of SIVmac-infected monkeys. This plasma and the IgG fraction of plasma from a rhesus monkey immunized with human rsCD4 in adjuvant demonstrate reactivity with a soluble form of the rhesus monkey CD4 molecule, exhibit binding to CD4+ but not CD8+ concanavalin A-activated rhesus monkey peripheral blood lymphocytes, and precipitate the CD4 molecule from surface-labeled activated rhesus monkey peripheral blood lymphocytes. Moreover, anti-viral activity is demonstrable in the IgG fraction of plasma from a human rsCD4-immunized monkey. These studies raise the possibility that a modified human CD4 molecule serving as an immunogen might elicit an antibody response that could potentially induce a beneficial therapeutic response in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The related staphylococcal toxins staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) are microbial superantigens. They require interaction with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to activate T cells. We have previously identified a binding site on SEA, the N-terminal 45 amino acids, as well as its corresponding receptor on the MHC antigen, residues 65-85 of the beta chain. To further characterize the structural basis for SEA binding to class II MHC molecules we have examined its relationship to TSST-1 binding. Both toxins bound similarly to murine A20 cells, but blockage of binding was observed only with the homologous toxin, which suggests that the binding sites for the two toxins on A20 cells are distinct. In contrast, specific binding of SEA was greater than that of TSST-1 on human Raji cells. Further, SEA was a better inhibitor of TSST-1 binding than was TSST-1 itself at low concentrations, but TSST-1 only minimally inhibited SEA binding. The data suggest that TSST-1 interacts with Raji cells at an SEA binding site, but with a lower affinity. The peptides SEA-(1-45) and I-A beta b-(65-85) were capable of blocking SEA binding on both A20 and Raji cells, but blockage was more effective on A20 cells. Neither peptide was capable of blocking TSST-1 binding on either cell line. The data are compatible with a model in which SEA has a binding site on A20 cells involving SEA-(1-45) and I-A beta b-(65-85) which is distinct from that which binds TSST-1, while at least two binding sites are present on Raji cells. One site involves predominantly the residue 1-45 region on SEA and the 65-85 region of the MHC beta chain, while the other site involves both a different region on the SEA molecule and a different site on the class II MHC molecule to which it binds. This latter site also binds TSST-1.\r"

Theoretical considerations as well as neurophysiological findings point to the importance in such processes of temporal correlations in neuronal activity. In a previous model, we showed that reentrant signaling among rhythmically active neuronal groups can correlate responses along spatially extended contours. We now have modified and extended this model to address the problems of perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation in vision. A novel feature is that the efficacy of the connections is allowed to change on a fast time scale. This results in active reentrant connections that amplify the correlations among neuronal groups. The responses of the model are able to link the elements corresponding to a coherent figure and to segregate them from the background or from another figure in a way that is consistent with the so-called Gestalt laws.\r"

  ".U": "91095414\r", 
  ".W": "The activities of most proteins are relatively insensitive to general anesthetics. A notable exception is firefly luciferase, whose sensitivity to a wide range of anesthetic agents closely parallels that of whole animals. We have now found that this sensitivity can be controlled by ATP. The enzyme is insensitive at low (microM) concentrations of ATP and very sensitive at high (mM) concentrations. The differential sensitivity varies from anesthetic to anesthetic, being greatest (about a 100-fold difference) for molecules with large apolar segments. This suggests that anesthetic sensitivity is modulated by changes in the hydrophobicity of the anesthetic-binding pocket. Parallel changes in the binding of the substrate firefly luciferin, for which anesthetics compete, indicate that anesthetics bind at the same site as the luciferin substrate. These changes in the nature of the binding pocket modify not only the sensitivity to anesthetics but also the position of the \"cutoff\" in the homologous series of primary alcohol anesthetics; the cutoff position can vary from octanol to pentadecanol, depending upon the concentration of ATP. Our results suggest that particularly sensitive anesthetic target sites in the central nervous system may possess anesthetic-binding pockets whose polarities are regulated by neuromodulatory agents.\r"

This putative protein, designated as interferon response element binding factor 1 (IREBF-1), contains an acidic domain, three heptad repeat leucine arrays, and a region that shares similarity with the yeast transcriptional factor GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, the C terminus of IREBF-1 shows an unusual amphipathic property: within a 79-amino acid range, one side of the alpha-helical region contains a preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids and the other side contains hydrophilic amino acids. This type of structure provides a strong hydrophobic force for protein-protein interaction.\r"

The genes chosen for study span MMU 16 and represent virtually the entire q arm of HSA 21. Because the somatostatin gene (SST), an HSA 3/MMU 16 locus, was previously shown to be in U10, the transferrin gene (TF), an HSA 3/MMU 9 marker, was also mapped to determine whether U10 contains any HSA 3 genes not represented on MMU 16. With the exception of the protamine gene PRM1 (HSA 16/MMU 16), all of the genes studied were syntenic on bovine U10. Thus, all homologous loci from HSA 21 that have been studied in the cow are on a single chromosome. The bovine homolog of HSA 21 also carries several HSA 3 genes, two of which have homologous loci on MMU 16. The syntenic association of genes from the q arm of HSA 3 with HSA 21 genes in two mammalian species, the mouse and the cow, indicates that HSA 21 may have that contained genes now residing on HSA 3. Additionally, the syntenic association of TF with SST in the cow permits the prediction that the rhodopsin gene (RHO) is proximal to TF on HSA 3q.\r"

In the first mutant, all but 16 amino acid residues of the intracellular domain of the receptor were removed. This receptor bound NGF with a Kd comparable to that of the wild-type receptor. A second mutant contained only the four cysteine-rich sequences from the extracellular portion of the protein. This mutant was expressed in COS cells and the resultant protein was a secreted soluble form of the receptor that was able to bind NGF. Two N-terminal deletions, in which either the first cysteine-rich sequence of the first and part of the second cysteine-rich sequences were removed, bound NGF. However, a mutant lacking all four cysteine-rich sequences was unable to bind NGF. These results show that the four cysteine-rich sequences of the NGF receptor contain the NGF binding domain.\r"

ORF2, which is expressed only as a 180-kDa fusion protein with ORF1, encodes a single-stranded RNA-binding domain and has the consensus sequence for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of (+)-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses (pol). We show that the 180-kDa protein is formed by -1 ribosomal frame-shifting by a mechanism indistinguishable from that of retro-viruses. Analysis of the \"slippery site\" suggests that a low probability of unpairing of the aminoacyl-tRNA from the 0-frame codon at the ribosomal A site reduces the efficiency of frameshifting more than the reluctance of a given tRNA to have its wobble base mispaired. Frameshifting of L-A requires a pseudoknot structure just downstream of the shift site. The efficiency of the L-A frameshift site is 1.8%, similar to the observed molar ratio in viral particles of the 180-kDa fusion protein to the major coat protein.\r"

Each of the RSF1010 ssi signals, ssiA and ssiB, could be replaced by a primosome assembly site from plasmid pACY184 or from bacteriophage phi X174. In these chimeric origins, replication of the strand complementary to that containing the primosome assembly site was no longer dependent on the RSF1010 primase, protein RepB', but required the E. coli primase, DnaG. If both ssiA and ssiB sites of RSF1010 were replaced by primosome assembly sites, protein RepB' was no longer essential for the replication at this origin, whereas proteins RepA and RepC of RSF1010 were still required. These results strongly suggest that the two ssi sites and the RepB' protein actually direct the priming of DNA synthesis in the replication of RSF1010, and the proteins RepA and RepC are involved in the prepriming events--i.e., the opening of the DNA duplex at oriV. It is evident that the origin of RSF1010 can be separated into three functional domains and reconstructed by replacing the ssi sites with heterologous elements.\r"

A Tetrahymena mutant precursor RNA lacking this P5abc is splicing-defective under standard conditions (5 mM MgCl2/200 mM NH4Cl, pH 7.5) in vitro. However, the mutant precursor RNA by itself is capable of performing the self-splicing reaction without P5abc under different conditions (15 mM MgCl2/2 mM spermidine, pH 7.5). We have investigated the functional role of the P5abc in the mechanism of the self-splicing reaction. When an RNA consisting of the P5abc but lacking the rest of the Tetrahymena intron is incubated with the mutant precursor, the self-splicing reaction proceeds highly efficiently under standard conditions (5 mM MgCl2/200 mM NH4Cl, pH 7.5). Two steps of the bimolecular self-splicing reaction can be performed accurately by a shortened precursor RNA containing all essential components required in the self-splicing reaction and an activator RNA consisting of the P5abc. Gel-mobility-shift assays suggest that two molecules associate by a direct RNA-RNA interaction during the splicing reaction. The results imply that there might exist other small RNAs whose role is to activate ribozymes.\r"

We developed a model of nonhomologous chromatid exchange involving breakpoint clusters at chromosomes 3p13, 3p11.2, 5q22, and 8q11.2. Subsequent chromatid segregation may result in net loss of the 3p segment either (i) in one step or (ii) after a nondisjunctional loss of the derivative chromosome carrying the 3p segment.

Northern blotting results with wild-type cells show that (i) control of crnA expression is subject to nitrate (and nitrite) induction as well as nitrogen metabolite repression and (ii) regulation of the crnA gene is exerted at the level of mRNA accumulation, most likely at transcription, in response to the nitrogen source in the growth medium. Furthermore, similar studies with mutants of nirA and areA control genes and the niaD nitrate reductase structural gene show that crnA expression is mediated by the products of nirA (nitrate induction control gene), areA (nitrogen metabolite repression control gene), and niaD (involved in autoregulation of nitrate reductase).\r"

Furthermore, in the presence of limiting 5' oligomer, greater than stoichiometric amounts of the single-stranded 3' acceptor fragment can be aminoacylated. This is due to a reiterative process of transient duplex formation followed by charging, dissociation of the 5' oligomer, and then rebinding to an uncharged single-stranded ribotridecamer so as to create another transient duplex substrate. Thus, a short RNA oligomer serves as a cofactor for a charging enzyme, and it thereby makes possible the aminoacylation of single-stranded RNA.

Furthermore, EGF administered via slow-release pellets in ovariectomized mice acted as a potent uterine and vaginal mitogen as well as an inducer of vaginal keratinization. Experiments with ovariectomized, adrenalectomized, hypophysectomized mice indicated that EGF mitogenesis does not require pituitary or adrenal hormones. Treatment with EGF also mimicked estrogen in the induction of uterine lactoferrin (a major estrogen-inducible secretory protein) mRNA and protein.

Recent evidence suggests that insulin and IGF-I half-receptors can heterologously assemble to form alpha 2 beta 2 insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor complexes in vivo and in vitro. We have utilized hybrid receptor complexes to examine ligand-stimulated transmembrane signaling of wild-type insulin (alpha beta INS.WT) or IGF-I (alpha beta IGF.WT) half-receptors assembled with a kinase-defective insulin half-receptor mutant (alpha beta INS.A/K). In vitro assembly of either (alpha beta)IGF.WT/(alpha beta)INS.A/K or (alpha beta)INS.WT/(alpha beta)INS.A/K hybrid receptors resulted in decreased substrate protein kinase activity. The degree of protein kinase inactivation directly correlated with the amount of immunologically cross-reactive hybrid receptors formed. In contrast to substrate kinase activity, insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the (alpha beta)INS.WT/(alpha beta)INS.A/K hybrid receptor complex was completely unaffected in comparison to the wild-type (alpha beta)INS.WT/(alpha beta)INS.WT receptor. To assess a molecular basis for this difference, autophosphorylation of a hybrid receptor composed of a truncated beta-subunit insulin half-receptor with the kinase-defective half-receptor, (alpha beta)INS. delta CT/(alpha beta)INS.A/K, demonstrated the exclusive autophosphorylation of the (alpha beta)INS.A/K half-receptor beta subunit. These results demonstrate that ligand-dependent substrate phosphorylation by insulin and IGF-I holoreceptors requires interactions between two functional beta subunits within the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex and occurs through an intramolecular trans-phosphorylation reaction.\r"

The 271-base-pair region separating the transcription start points of the promoters malEp and malKp comprises a compact array of binding sites for MalT and CRP. We report the characterization of the in vitro interactions of CRP with its four adjacent binding sites and the analysis of their function in vivo. By using the DNase I footprinting technique, we showed that CRP binds with high affinity to the three malEp-proximal sites and with a low affinity to the fourth site. CRP binding to these sites is not cooperative, even though they are adjacent and located on the same face of the DNA double helix. Each of these sites was destroyed by localized mutagenesis and the residual activity of the promoters was measured in vivo. Mutations in any of the three high-affinity binding sites reduced both malEp and malKp activity. The participation of several adjacent bound CRP molecules in the activation of a promoter is an unprecedented observation and might involve molecular mechanisms quite different from those used in the other CRP-controlled promoters.\r"

Cloning of the gene encoding this enzyme was carried out by mixed oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction amplification of rabbit liver single-stranded cDNA using sense and antisense 20- to 24-base-pair (bp) primers. A rabbit liver library in phage lambda gt10 yielded a 2.5-kilobase (kb) cDNA with a 447-amino acid coding sequence. None of the nine asparagine residues were in an Asn-Xaa-(Ser or Thr) sequence, indicating that the protein is not N-glycosylated. There is no sequence homology to other previously cloned glycosyltransferases, but GnT I appears to have a domain structure typical of these enzymes--i.e., a short amino-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, a \"neck\" region, and a large carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain.

No consistent change in ultrastructure of the receptor could be detected after the addition of insulin alone or insulin and Mn2+/Mg2+/ATP. After partial reduction of the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptor into alpha beta heterodimers, the electron micrographs showed a clear reduction in average size of the molecule with disappearance of the T profiles characteristic of the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramers. By incubation of the heterodimers in a phosphorylation medium containing insulin, a reassociation to molecules with molecular weights of the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer took place judged from SDS/PAGE. Electron microscopy showed that the molecule formed larger aggregates, and only a few solitary T-shaped copies were seen.\r"

In every case, when synchronized human myeloma cells were released from stationary phase by incubation in fresh medium containing antisense oligomers, cell division was prevented or inhibited; sense oligomers and random antisense oligomers had no effect. A detailed analysis of synchronized cell populations indicated that sense-treated and untreated cells divided approximately 17 hr after growth initiation, whereas cells incubated with antisense oligomer 183, a 16-mer targeted 5 bases downstream of the initiation codon, entered mitosis approximately one cell division late. The failure to divide correlated directly with a deficit in prothymosin alpha and with the continued presence of intact intracellular antisense oligomers over a period of at least 24 hr. Because antisense oligomers had no effect either on the timing of the induction of prothymosin alpha mRNA upon growth stimulation or on mRNA levels seen throughout the cell cycle, we concluded that antisense DNA caused specific hybrid arrest of translation. Our data suggest that prothymosin alpha is required for cell division. However, there is no evidence that prothymosin alpha directly regulates mitosis.\r"

NMR results indicate that guanosine imino protons of the G.A mismatches are not hydrogen bonded but are stacked in the helix. A G----I substitution in either G.A base pair causes a dramatic decrease in duplex stability and indicates that hydrogen bonding of the guanosine amino group is critical. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY) results indicate that the overall duplex conformation is in the B-family. Cross-strand NOEs in two-dimensional NOESY spectra between a mismatched AH2 and an AH1' of the other mismatched base pair and between a mismatched GH8 and GNH1 of the other mismatch establish a purine-purine stacking pattern, adenosine over adenosine and guanosine over guanosine, which strongly stabilizes the duplex. A computer graphics molecular model of the unusual duplex was constructed with G.A base pairs containing A-NH2 to GN3 and G-NH2 to AN7 hydrogen bonds and B-form base pairs on both sides of the G.A pairs [5'-d(ATGAGC)]. The energy-minimized duplex satisfies all experimental constraints from NOESY and COSY results. A hydrogen bond from G-NH2 of the mismatch to a phosphate oxygen is predicted.\r"

Five cell types and tissues have been investigated to study the relationship between methylation level and gene expression. For each cell type used, the majority of CpG sites showed a similar level of methylation. Of two gene-nonexpressing tissues, erythrocytes are hypomethylated, whereas liver is methylated at most of its CpG sites. For gene-expressing tissues, oviduct is completely unmethylated, whereas HD-11 culture cells are methylated. Thus no correlation is observed between degree of CpG methylation and level of expression of the lysozyme gene. The observed methylation patterns are discussed in terms of possible features of the local chromatin structure.\r"

Transcripts for both EGF and TGF-alpha mRNA were detected in virgin and pregnant mice, whereas transcripts for EGF mRNA but not TGF-alpha mRNA were expressed in 10-day lactating mice. TGF-alpha was localized in the epithelial cap-cell layer of the advancing terminal end bud and in the stromal fibroblasts at the base of the terminal end bud; EGF was localized in the inner layers of the terminal end bud and in ductal cells of mammary epithelium. Implantation of pellets containing EGF or TGF-alpha into the regressed mammary gland of ovariectomized mice stimulated the reappearance of end buds; contralateral glands implanted with pellets containing albumin or insulin were not affected. These results indicate that an EGF-receptor-mediated pathway remained intact in the mammary gland epithelium in the absence of ovarian steroids and that local availability of either EGF or TGF-alpha is sufficient to stimulate the pattern of normal ductal growth. The detection of EGF and TFF-alpha transcripts at different stages of mammary gland development and the different patterns of immunolocalization suggest that each polypeptide plays a different role in normal mammary gland morphogenesis.\r"

In quantitative ligand autoradiography, the in vitro equilibrium binding of 125I-rhNGF to brain sections showed a 10-fold regional variation in density and was saturable, reversible, and specifically displaced by up to 74% with rhNGF or murine NGF (muNGF). At equilibrium, 125I-rhNGF bound to these sites with high affinity (Kd 52-85 pM) and low capacity (Bmax less than or equal to 13.2 fmol/mg of protein). Calculation of 125I-rhNGF binding affinity by kinetic methods gave average Kd values of 24 and 31 pM. Computer-generated maps revealed binding in brain regions not identified previously with 125I-muNGF, including hippocampus; dentate gyrus; amygdala; paraventricular thalamus; frontal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate cortices; nucleus accumbens; olfactory tubercle; subiculum; pineal gland; and medial geniculate nucleus. NGF binding sites were distributed in a 2-fold increasing medial-lateral gradient in the caudate-putamen and a 2-fold lateral-medial gradient in the nucleus accumbens. 125I-rhNGF binding sites were also found in most areas labeled by 125I-muNGF, including the interpedunucular nucleus, cerebellum, forebrain cholinergic nuclei, caudoventral caudate-putamen, and trigeminal nerve nucleus. 125I-rhNGF binding sites were absent from areas replete with low-affinity NGF binding sites, including circumventricular organs, myelinated fiber bundles, and choroid plexus. The present analysis provides an anatomical differentiation of high-affinity 125I-rhNGF binding sites and greatly expands the number of brain structures that may respond to endogenous NGF or exogenously administered rhNGF.\r"

Selected suppressor MTS enzymes all possess one or several mutations in the vicinity of Trp-461, a residue that is the major contributor to the stability of complexes formed with tRNAs having the cognate CAU anticodon. Analysis of catalytic properties of purified suppressor enzymes shows that they have acquired an additional specificity toward the amber anticodon without complete disruption of the methionine anticodon site. It is concluded that both positive and negative discrimination toward the binding of tRNA anticodon sequences is restricted to a limited region of the synthetase, residues 451-467.\r"

R. M., Rothbard, J., Gotch, F. M., Bahadur, G., Wraith, D. & McMichael, A. J. (1986) Cell 44, 959-968]. We find that intact Db class I heterodimers on the cell surface are unreceptive to binding this antigen. However, NP365-380 readily associates with Db molecules on the plasma membrane in the presence of exogenous beta 2-microglobulin. In addition, there is a second pathway through which this peptide associates with class I molecules that requires energy and de novo protein synthesis.

Amylase in D. pseudoobscura is a family of three genes, and some chromosomes have deletions for one or two of them. Two overlapping clones covering 26 kilobases were isolated and used as probes to survey DNA restriction map polymorphism among 28 lines, representing five of the major inversion types found in natural populations, as well as single chromosomes from the closely related species Drosophila persimilis and Drosophila miranda. Restriction-site differences are considerably greater among the various gene arrangements than among chromosomes with the same gene arrangement. Clustering the restriction map haplotypes yielded a dendrogram concordant with the phylogeny generated independently from cytogenetic considerations. The inversion polymorphism is estimated to be about 2 million years old.\r"

The Z-DNA epitopes were detected in subdivision C2 only during late third instar when the transcriptional activity of the locus was high. Accumulation of nonhistone chromosomal proteins in that locus was also detected during late third instar only at the time of the Z-DNA formation. Northern blot data and nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the Z-DNA-forming sequence is located between two transcription units whose expression is regulated during the third instar. Our results suggest that in subdivision 4-75C2 a B- to Z-DNA flux occurs at a specific time during late third instar and that this flux may play a negative as well as a positive role in gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Thalassemia is a hereditary disease caused by any of 90 different point mutations in the beta-globin gene. Specific populations generally carry a small number of mutations, the most common of which are those that are widely distributed regionally. The present study constitutes an extensive molecular characterization of this disease in a small, highly inbred ethnic group with a high incidence of beta-thalassemia--the Jews of Kurdistan. An unusual mutational diversity was observed. In 42 sibships 13 different mutations were identified, of which 3 are newly discovered: a C----A transversion at -88 to the cap site, a frameshift in codon 36/37, and an A----G transition in the polyadenylylation signal. Four of the mutations are unique to Kurdish Jews and have not been discovered in any other population. A fifth was found outside Kurdish Jews only in an Iranian from Khuzistan, a region bordering Kurdistan. Two-thirds of the mutant chromosomes carry the mutations unique to Kurdish Jews. We traced the origin of the mutations to specific geographic regions within Kurdistan. This information, supported by haplotype analysis, suggests that thalassemia in central Kurdistan (northern Iraq) has evolved primarily from multiple mutational events. In Turkish Kurdistan, the primary mechanism is genetic admixture with the local population. In Iranian Kurdistan, a founder effect appears to be partly responsible. We conclude that several evolutionary mechanisms contributed to the evolution of beta-thalassemia in this small ethnic isolate.\r"

  ".W": "Studies have shown that hemophilia B (Christmas disease; factor IX deficiency) results from many different mutations in the factor IX gene, of which greater than 95% are single nucleotide substitutions. This study has identified a previously unreported form of hemophilia B in a patient who was a somatic mosaic for a guanine-to-cytosine transversion at nucleotide 31,170 in the factor IX gene. This point mutation changes the codon for residue 350 in the catalytic domain of factor IX from a cysteine to a serine. We used differential termination of primer extension to confirm and measure the degree of mosaicism. Our study shows that a varying proportion of cells from hepatic, renal, smooth muscle, and hematopoietic populations possessed normal as well as mutant factor IX sequences. These results indicate that the mutation in this patient occurred either as an uncorrected half-chromatid mutation in the female gamete or as a replication or postreplication error in the initial mitotic divisions of the zygote preceding implantation. In addition, this kindred also contains two females in successive generations who have moderately severe factor IX deficiency. The molecular pathogenesis of this latter phenomenon has been studied and seems to relate to the unaccompanied expression of the mutant factor IX gene consequent upon a second, as yet undefined, genetic event that has prevented inactivation of sequences including the mutant factor IX gene on the X chromosome inherited from the affected male.\r"

Our results establish that a major subpopulation of gamma delta intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes is produced from uncommitted precursors at extrathymic sites. This work further shows that a small pool of T cells carrying alpha beta T-cell receptors can also differentiate extrathymically from CD3- fetal liver precursors but with rates of production and peripheral expansion much reduced as compared with those observed in thymus-bearing animals.\r"

  ".U": "91095455\r", 
  ".W": "A 203-base-pair sequence 5' of the latency-associated transcripts (LATs) of herpes simplex virus type 1 contains a 7-base consensus sequence TGCGTCA that is identical to the cAMP-response element of the proenkephalin gene. This consensus sequence is at -38 relative to the putative 5' end of the LATs with a TATA box at the -24 position. In transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, this enhancer region stimulated gene expression up to 3-fold in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, nerve growth factor, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Mutation of the cAMP-response element to TGCG-CAA resulted in a 4-fold reduction of basal activity and a complete loss of inducible stimulation. In DNA gel retardation assays, purified cAMP-response element-binding protein and a nuclear protein from PC12 cells were shown to bind specifically to this element. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the reactivation of wild-type herpes simplex virus type 1 from dissociated latently infected murine trigeminal ganglia was significantly accelerated (P less than 0.005) by the addition of cAMP analogs or adenylate cyclase activators. However, these reagents did not accelerate reactivation of a deletion mutant that lacks the putative cAMP-response element-containing promoter region, transcriptional start site, and 1015 base pairs of the LATs. These studies demonstrate that the promoter region of the LATs contains a functional cAMP-response element and that expression of the LATs is likely controlled by second messenger signal transduction and imply a role for cAMP in triggering viral reactivation.\r"

We have isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic clones encoding a voltage-dependent K+ channel isoform expressed in human islets and in a human insulinoma. This K+ channel isoform, designated hPCN1, with a deduced amino acid sequence of 613 residues (Mr = 67,097), is related to the Shaker family of Drosophila K+ channels. hPCN1 is homologous to two other human K+ channel isoforms we have isolated, hPCN2 and hPCN3, with 55% and 65% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. The electrophysiological characteristics of hPCN1 were determined after microinjection of synthetic RNA into Xenopus oocytes. Two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings of oocytes injected with hPCN1 RNA revealed a voltage-dependent outward K+ current that inactivated slowly with time. Outward currents were inhibited by 4-aminopyridine with a Ki less than 0.10 mM and were relatively insensitive to tetraethylammonium ion or Ba2+. A delayed rectifier K+ channel such as hPCN1 could restore the resting membrane potential of beta cells after depolarization and thereby contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-derived growth factor receptors are composed of two subunits (alpha and beta) that associate with one another to form three functionally active dimeric receptor species. The two subunits are encoded by separate loci in humans and other species. In this study, we used conventional interspecific backcross mapping and an analysis of a deletional mutation to establish close linkage between the alpha-subunit gene (Pdgfra) and the dominant spotting (W) locus on mouse chromosome 5. Further, by analyzing the restriction fragment length polymorphisms in interspecific F1 hybrids, we were able to demonstrate that the closely associated patch (Ph) locus carries a deletion in Pdgfra. This observation was confirmed by both DNA and RNA analysis of 10.5-day fetuses produced from crosses between Ph heterozygotes. Out of 16 fetuses analyzed, Pdgfra genomic sequences were absent and no mRNA for the receptor was detected in 6 fetuses that were developmentally abnormal (the presumptive Ph homozygotes). We also determined that the deletion associated with the Ph mutation does not extend into the coding sequences of the adjacent Kit gene, by analysis of the genomic DNA from both the interspecific F1 hybrids and the presumptive Ph homozygotes. The absence of Pdgfra genomic sequences and the lack of detectable message associated with the Ph mutation should make this mutant a valuable asset for understanding the role of the receptor alpha subunit during mammalian development.\r"

A specific immune coisolation assay was performed on extracts of T-47D human breast cancer cells with a monoclonal antibody specific for the full-length B form of progesterone receptor (PR-B). This resulted in coisolation of significant amounts of truncated form-A receptors (PR-A), indicating the presence of stable PR-A.PR-B dimers in solution. A positive correlation was observed between the ability of different receptor forms to oligomerize in solution and their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences. The ability to form stable PR-A.PR-B oligomers in the absence of DNA was also found to correlate with release of 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) from the unactivated PR complex. These results support the hypothesis that dimerization in the absence of DNA is an important mechanism controlling receptor DNA-binding function and that hsp90 release may be a key step regulating dimerization. This suggests that hsp90 may function to repress DNA-binding activity indirectly by blocking receptor dimerization.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acid sequences of 17 bacterial membrane proteins that are components of periplasmic permeases and function in the uptake of a variety of small molecules and ions are highly homologous to each other and contain sequence motifs characteristic of nucleotide-binding proteins. These proteins are known to bind ATP and are postulated to be the energy-coupling components of the permeases. Several medically important eukaryotic proteins, including the multidrug-resistance transporters and the protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis gene, are also homologous to this family. By multiple sequence alignment of these 17 proteins, the consensus sequence, secondary structure, and surface exposure were predicted. The secondary structural motifs that are conserved among nucleotide-binding proteins were identified in adenylate kinase, p21ras, and elongation factor Tu by superposition of their known tertiary structures. The equivalent secondary structural elements in the predicted conserved component were located. These, together with sequence information, served as guides for alignment with adenylate kinase. A model for the structure of the ATP-binding domain of the permease proteins is proposed by analogy to the adenylate kinase structure. The characteristics of several permease mutations and biochemical data lend support to the model.\r"

However, these forms differ in two respects: the extracellular forms have only their single plasma membrane, whereas the forms freed from host cells have, in addition, a surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane; the forms that develop extracellularly have fewer ribosomes. Five monoclonal antibodies against the ring stage have been prepared and characterized. Their pattern of immunofluorescence localization differs in merozoites as compared with rings, but their pattern is identical in rings developed extracellularly and those developed intracellularly. These results and the observations on fine structure demonstrate biochemical and morphological differentiation in the extracellular forms.\r"

Furthermore, during an early stage of myc-induced pathology, transformed acinar-derived cells appear within islets, suggesting that islet hormones may influence the progression of these exocrine pancreatic tumors. These findings demonstrate that the initial oncogenic alteration can influence the pattern of subsequent tumor pathogenesis and, given that human exocrine pancreatic tumors are predominantly ductal adenocarcinomas, support the suggestion that transformed acinar cells may contribute to the genesis of this serious disease in man.\r"

Twenty-one (4 per cent) patients had uraemia which could be clearly attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment; 18 of these cases were shown to have significant renovascular pathology. Following withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor the renal failure reversed in the majority of patients. We also examined 400 consecutive hypertensive patients referred over a similar period and, although vascular imaging was performed only when it was considered to be clinically indicated, 58 (14.5 per cent) of these patients were shown to have renovascular pathology. A further five patients with stable chronic renal disease were seen to have a deterioration in their glomerular filtration rate coincident with commencement of ACE inhibitor therapy; this reversed when the agents were withdrawn. These observations indicate that significant renovascular disease may be more common than has been hitherto recognized and that injudicious use of ACE inhibitors may result in serious complications. Methods which may minimize such iatrogenic disease are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "During a nine-year period, 14 cases of mycobacterial infection (tuberculosis) developed in 403 renal transplant recipients at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, an incidence of 3.5 per cent. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was about 50 times higher than that in the general population. Infection was disseminated in nine (64.3 per cent), pulmonary in four (28.6 per cent), and genitourinary in 1 (7.1 per cent). In one patient tuberculosis was transmitted by the donor's kidney. The clinical manifestations were often ill-defined and not different from that in the normal host. Cultures from all patients grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis; concomitant infection with other organisms was present in five patients (35.7 per cent). Two of 18 patients (group 1) with positive pretransplant tuberculin skin test developed tuberculosis after transplantation (11 per cent), and neither received isoniazid prophylaxis; three of 70 patients (group 2) with negative skin tests developed tuberculosis after transplantation (4.3 per cent). The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Review of all published cases of mycobacterial infections in renal transplant recipients revealed 130 cases. Tuberculosis was disseminated in 38.7 per cent, pulmonary in 40.2 per cent, cutaneous in 12 per cent, and miscellaneous in 9.4 per cent. Atypical mycobacteria were responsible for 29 per cent of disseminated infections, 8 per cent of pulmonary infections and all cases of cutaneous and articular tuberculosis. Invasive procedures were needed to establish the diagnosis in 21 of 33 disseminated cases but in only three of 47 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (p less than 0.0001). The mortality rate from disseminated disease was 37 per cent and from all other forms of tuberculosis was 11 per cent (p less than 0.005). These findings (1) confirm the higher incidence of tuberculosis in renal transplant recipients, compared to the general population; (2) suggest that pretransplant skin testing probably has little value in identifying patients at risk; (3) show that disseminated tuberculosis is common after renal transplantation and requires invasive procedures for diagnosis; (4) confirm that the donor kidney may be an important source of infection; and (5) indicate that concomitant infection with other organisms is common.\r"

  ".U": "91095523\r", 
  ".W": "Out of a population of 97 haemodialysis patients, 36 patients with dialysis arthropathy were identified. Dialysis arthropathy is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis which affected 97 per cent of the patients who had been undergoing cuprophane haemodialysis for more than 10 years. It commonly affected the shoulders, hips, hands, knees and wrists, worsening with time and extending to other joints. Fifty-eight per cent of the patients complained of morning stiffness and 47 per cent complained of exacerbation of shoulder pain during or after haemodialysis. Half of the patients also suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome, which recurred and was associated with a long-lasting disability. The most common radiological abnormality was periarticular bone cysts, followed by articular erosions and a destructive spondyloarthropathy, but clinical symptoms were more common than radiological signs. Patients with dialysis arthropathy had a higher C-reactive protein level than patients without arthropathy (18.6 mg/l versus 11.4 mg/l), indicative of an inflammatory process. Some of the clinical manifestations of the disease correlated with levels of C-reactive protein and ferritin. Serum ferritin levels correlated strongly with the units of blood transfused in the past five years (RS = 0.83), and the logarithm of ferritin level correlated weakly with C-reactive protein (r = 0.32). Haemarthroses were documented in 19 per cent of patients. Mean serum beta 2-microglobulin was elevated in the patients with (57.3 mg/l) and without arthropathy (50.7 mg/l), and there was no difference in the parathormone or aluminium levels between these groups. Articular tissue was obtained in 25 patients; beta 2-microglobulin amyloid was present in 24. Larger deposits were present in the capsular tissue, and these appeared to replace collagen bundles in eight cases. Amyloid deposits replaced the lining layer in six cases. It is likely therefore that amyloid disrupts normal joint function by replacing normal joint tissue. Mild chronic synovitis with haemosiderin deposition were found in approximately 60 per cent of cases. These findings suggest that amyloid derived from beta 2-microglobulin has a primary role in the pathogenesis of dialysis arthropathy, but there was also evidence of inflammatory processes. It is suggested that iron overload or haemarthroses might contribute to the inflammation, but other factors, such as dialysis-related bioincompatibility reactions, may also have a role.\r"

The most common focus of infection leading to nosocomial and community-acquired bacteremia due to E. coli was the urinary tract. Twenty-six percent of adult female patients with E. coli bacteremia resulting from a urinary tract infection were diabetic. The O antigen serotypes identified most often were O6, O2, O1, O4, O15, and O75; the multiply resistant O15 serotype of E. coli was implicated in a community outbreak of urinary tract infection. Ampicillin resistance in strains causing community-acquired infection increased to the same level as that of strains causing nosocomial infection (almost 50%). The overall mortality was 20.7% and was greater in the presence of shock (52.4% vs. 15.3%). Death due to infection occurred in 2.6% and 10.3%, respectively, of cases with urinary tract and non-urinary tract foci. The adverse influence of inappropriate initial therapy on outcome was more marked in the latter half of the study.\r"

This paper analyzes (by means of a retrospective and partially prospective clinical protocol) our experience with 82 patients with CGD2 bacteriuria. The infection was symptomatic in 62% of cases, and the clinical diagnoses included acute and chronic cystitis and pyelonephritis with or without bacteremia. Because CGD2 infection of the urinary tract may require specific antimicrobial treatment and because CGD2 is a fastidious microorganism, we recommend prolonged incubation of urine cultures (up to 48-72 hours), especially if the routine culture is negative, when patients are symptomatic, have alkaline urine, or have struvite crystals in the urine sediment.\r"

Volunteers who were seronegative for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen were enrolled in the study and received either im or id vaccine. A total of 108 subjects received three 1-mL im injections of hepatitis B vaccine, and another 110 subjects received four 0.1-mL id injections of the vaccine. Similar rates of seroconversion occurred; greater than or equal to 10 mIU of anti-HBs/mL was noted following either three im or three id vaccinations. Furthermore, 2 years after initiation of vaccination, the serum concentration of anti-HBs for id vaccine recipients was similar to that for im vaccine recipients.\r"

In vitro, the antibiotics most active against Brucella include the tetracyclines, the aminoglycosides, the aminopenicillins, some cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, rifampin, and some new fluorinated quinolones. Because Brucella species are facultative intracellular parasites, the penetration of drugs into and within phagocytes and phagosomes can be problematic and can best be studied in experimental animals or tissue cultures. In humans, the effectiveness of various regimens of chemotherapy has been compared best in acute bacteremic infections by assessment of the control of symptoms, bacteremia, complications, and relapses. The standard therapy against which all other therapies have been judged is a combination of tetracycline and streptomycin, which is almost universally effective but fails to prevent relapse in 10% of cases. A combination of oral doxycycline and rifampin is convenient and currently popular; it is highly effective, with an average relapse rate of only 8.4%. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is less effective in controlling bacteremia and other manifestations: in collected series, 5.7% of cases did not respond and 12% relapsed. Drug-resistant Brucella strains are rarely a cause of therapy failure. Localized brucellosis poses special problems, often requiring surgery in addition to prolonged combined chemotherapy.\r"

Successful use of exchange blood transfusion as a therapeutic adjunct for this infection was first reported in 1974, although the efficacy of this procedure has not been established by randomized, controlled trials. The rationale for this form of therapy is based on: (1) rapid reduction in the parasite load by direct removal; (2) decreased risk of severe intravascular hemolysis and its consequences (disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal dysfunction); (3) improved rheology with transfused blood and reduced microcirculatory sludging; and (4) improved oxygen-carrying capacity with transfused erythrocytes. We describe a case of severe falciparum malaria and review the literature describing the use of exchange transfusion for treatment of this infection.\r"

  ".W": "Many antimicrobial agents have been associated with hypoprothrombinemia. The precise mechanisms are unknown, but alteration in vitamin K status or utilization is involved. The two postulated mechanisms implicate either direct inhibition of biosynthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by the N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) moiety found in certain antimicrobial agents or eradication of vitamin K-producing intestinal microflora in patients with reduced oral intake of vitamin K. An English-language review of all prospective studies reported between 1966 and 1988 in which serial prothrombin times were monitored in adult patients revealed that the incidence of hypoprothrombinemia varied from 3.7% to 64% with NMTT-containing regimens and from 0% to 24% with non-NMTT-containing regimens. Detailed evaluation of these and other studies suggests that certain risk factors, including malnutrition, hepatic and renal dysfunction, older age, and severity of illness, may be the major determinants of hypoprothrombinemia. The hypothesis that the NMTT side chain is primarily responsible for hypoprothrombinemia may not be justified. We conclude that patients at high risk for coagulopathy should be carefully monitored and that serious consideration should be given to the use of prophylactic vitamin K in such cases.\r"

Use of prophylactic aerosolized pentamidine may have facilitated the relative prevalence of extrapulmonary disease because of its inadequate systemic distribution. An increase in reported cases of infections due to P. carinii has been seen in conjunction with AIDS, but extrapulmonary pneumocystosis represents less than 1% of all cases of infection with P. carinii. Several organs or tissues may be involved, but the most common sites are lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Extrapulmonary spread of P. carinii infection occurs via both lymphatic and hematogenous routes. While all patients with disseminated forms of this infection die rapidly, survival for patients with AIDS is possible if systemic treatment is provided, if a single extrapulmonary site is involved, and if no concomitant pneumonia is present. Because of the increasing frequency of this condition in patients who do not have pneumonia due to P. carinii, extrapulmonary pneumocystosis should be included among the AIDS-defining criteria.\r"

This review appraises 2,121 cases reported in 497 articles in the literature and analyzes 440 courses of treatment of infection at various body sites in 379 patients. The exclusion of early failures of therapy skews the results toward a favorable outcome. The rate of response to amphotericin B is 55%. Mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients exceeds 94% regardless of therapy, as does that from cerebral aspergillosis in all hosts. Amphotericin B (1 mg/[kg.d]) with flucytosine lowers mortality in neutropenic patients with pulmonary aspergillosis who did not receive a bone marrow transplant; relapse is common. Surgical debridement of aspergillus maxillary sinusitis is usually curative in nonimmunocompromised patients, whereas it increases mortality among neutropenic patients. Valve replacement is essential for aspergillus endocarditis. Both vitrectomy and intravitreal amphotericin B treatment are essential for aspergillus endophthalmitis. Flucytosine is somewhat useful clinically. Itraconazole shows efficacy in the treatment of pulmonary, skeletal, and pericardial aspergillosis. Although liposomal amphotericin B is less toxic than standard preparations of the drug, relevant data are limited. The proposed potentiation of amphotericin B by rifampin is unsupported by clinical data. Despite \"conventional\" therapy, mortality from invasive aspergillosis remains high; new approaches must be investigated.\r"

The difference in risk for fatality was designated the factor fatality difference (FFD); the FFD was determined by subtracting the percent fatality for factor-negative patients from the percent fatality for factor-positive patients. FFD was useful for selection of good indicators of severity of disease. Blood pH of less than 7.35 was the best single factor; low platelet count came next, followed by low blood pressure, cyanosis, ecchymosis, and low blood leukocyte count. New scores were constructed based on multiple regression analyses. Several older and new scores seemed to be comparable. By combining age-adjusted systolic blood pressure (less than 100 mm Hg), cyanosis, ecchymosis, diarrhea before or at admission, cold extremities, absence of nuchal or back rigidity, and rectal temperature of greater than or equal to 40 degrees C, a simple bedside percentage score, the MenOPP bedside clinical score (MOC), was devised. Cross-evaluations on test materials generally confirmed the choice of score. The simplicity of this score made it more clinically suitable than laboratory or mixed laboratory and bedside scores.\r"

The records of 35 of these patients form the basis of this study. Twelve (71%) of the 17 infected and nine (50%) of the 18 colonized patients had received or were receiving antimicrobial therapy. Eleven of 17 patients (three of seven with septicemia, three of five with pneumonia, three with urinary tract infection, and two with wound infection) responded to antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic studies of the potential environmental sources revealed growth of X. maltophilia in two water faucets and in one water sample from the medical intensive care unit. X. maltophilia is emerging as an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.\r"

Obtaining high-resolution images of these radiation-sensitive specimens has, until recently, been problematic. The development of spot-scan imaging, in which the electron beam is focused to a spot with a diameter of about 1000 angstroms and moved over the specimen to record the image, has overcome some of the most severe problems, which result from beam-induced motion of the specimen and its image. Elimination of this motion greatly enhances the contrast of high-resolution features of the image and promises a significant increase in the speed with which future structural work can be accomplished.\r"

  ".U": "91095975\r", 
  ".W": "The three-dimensional structure of spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) has been determined by x-ray diffraction at 2.6 angstroms (A) resolution and initially refined to an R factor of 0.226 at 2.2 A resolution. The model includes the flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group and the protein chain from residue 19 through the carboxyl terminus at residue 314 and is composed of two domains. The FAD binding domain (residues 19 to 161) has an antiparallel beta barrel core and a single alpha helix for binding the pyrophosphate of FAD. The NADP binding domain (residues 162 to 314) has a central five-strand parallel beta sheet and six surrounding helices. Binding of the competitive inhibitor 2'-phospho-AMP (AMP, adenosine monophosphate) places the NADP binding site at the carboxyl-terminal edge of the sheet in a manner similar to the nucleotide binding of the dehydrogenase family. The structures reveal the key residues that function in cofactor binding and the catalytic center. With these key residues as a guide, conclusive evidence is presented that the ferredoxin reductase structure is a prototype for the nicotinamide dinucleotide and FAD binding domains of the enzymes NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, NADPH-sulfite reductase, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, and NADH-nitrate reductase. Thus this structure provides a structural framework for the NADH- or NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme parts of five distinct enzymes involved in photosynthesis, in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulfur, in fatty-acid oxidation, in the reduction of methemoglobin, and in the metabolism of many pesticides, drugs, and carcinogens.\r"

NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which secrete this epithelial cell-specific mitogen, were transfected with a keratinocyte expression complementary DNA library. Among several transformed foci identified, one demonstrated the acquisition of specific high-affinity KGF binding sites. The pattern of binding competition by related fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) indicated that this receptor had high affinity for acidic FGF as well as KGF. The rescued 4.2-kilobase complementary DNA was shown to encode a predicted membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase related to but distinct from the basic FGF receptor. This expression cloning approach may be generally applicable to the isolation of genes that constitute limiting steps in mitogenic signaling pathways.\r"

  ".U": "91095978\r", 
  ".W": "A wide variety of nonexcitable cells generate repetitive transient increases in cytosolic calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) when stimulated with agonists that engage the phosphoinositide signalling pathway. Current theories regarding the mechanisms of oscillation disagree on whether Ca2+ inhibits or stimulates its own release from internal stores and whether inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG) also undergo oscillations linked to the Ca2+ spikes. In this study, Ca2+ was found to stimulate its own release in REF52 fibroblasts primed by mitogens plus depolarization. However, unlike Ca2+ release in muscle and nerve cells, this amplification was insensitive to caffeine or ryanodine and required hormone receptor occupancy and functional IP3 receptors. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i were accompanied by oscillations in IP3 concentration but did not require functional protein kinase C. Therefore, the dominant feedback mechanism in this cell type appears to be Ca2+ stimulation of phospholipase C once this enzyme has been activated by hormone receptors.\r"

The present studies examined whether NMDA receptors might be involved in the development of opiate tolerance and dependence, two examples of behavioral plasticity. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 attenuated the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine without affecting acute morphine analgesia. In addition, MK-801 attenuated the development of morphine dependence as assessed by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may be important in the development of opiate tolerance and dependence.\r"

Missense mutations within this domain have provided insights into the structural elements critical for its function. Net negative charge contributed to, but was not sufficient for, transcriptional activation by VP16. A putative amphipathic alpha helix did not appear to be an important structural component of the activation domain. A phenylalanine residue at position 442 was exquisitely sensitive to mutation. Transcriptional activators of several classes contain hydrophobic amino acids arranged in patterns resembling that of VP16. Therefore, the mechanism of transcriptional activation by VP16 and other proteins may involve both ionic and specific hydrophobic interactions with target molecules.\r"

These structures contain 12 antiparallel beta strands organized into a folding pattern with approximate threefold internal symmetry. Topologically equivalent folds have been previously observed for soybean trypsin inhibitor and interleukins-1 beta and -1 alpha. The locations of sequences implicated in receptor and heparin binding by FGF are presented. These sites include beta-sheet strand 10, which is adjacent to the site of an extended sequence insertion in several oncogene proteins of the FGF family, and which shows sequence conservation among the FGF family and interleukin-1 beta.\r"

Our survey was designed to identify alcohol and cocaine use, and related psychosocial patterns. Men drank more and more often than women. Our data suggest that body weight should be considered in defining those who drink heavily and often. We define 'frequent heavy drinking' as five or more drinks in a row each week for men and three to four drinks or more in a row each week for women. Frequent heavy drinkers, cocaine users, and students with psychosocial problems appeared disproportionately among students planning to join fraternities and sororities. Although first-year students used cocaine infrequently, its users followed the patterns of frequent heavy drinkers. We believe efforts to correct alcohol and cocaine misuse by college students should be directed, in part, at social organizations such as Greek-letter societies. Also, we must attend to psychosocial features that predispose to alcohol and cocaine misuse.\r"

After intraoperative colonic washout in 10 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, quantitative and qualitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the intraluminal and mucosal bacteria were obtained. Tissue was also removed for scanning electron microscopic examination of the colon wall. Whereas 1000-fold to 10,000-fold reductions of aerobic and anaerobic intraluminal flora were achieved with mechanical lavage, reductions of aerobic or anaerobic mucosal bacteria were not significant. Failure to diminish bacterial colonization in this ecologic niche may be partly responsible for the persistently high infection rate after emergency colorectal surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients had delayed Williams' vulvovaginoplasty after supralevator total pelvic exenteration. Of the three patients who died of carcinoma of the cervix (at 2, 5, and 15 months after vulvovaginoplasty), the first died before having a chance to attempt intercourse, but the other two had reported intercourse on at least two occasions after the reconstruction. One of the patients described the experiences as neither pleasant nor unpleasant but stated that her husband seemed satisfied. The other patient described the experience as satisfactory to both herself and her husband. The remaining four patients are alive with no evidence of recurrent disease at 28, 42, 56, and 106 months after operation. Two of these patients have reported entirely satisfactory sexual relations approximating pre-exenteration frequency, but the remaining two have not had sexual relations since surgery. Both give the main reason for this as lack of opportunity. The Williams' vulvovaginoplasty appears to be a reasonable alternative for vaginal reconstruction in patients who will have and especially who have had exenteration. To improve results, other methods of vaginal reconstruction should continue to be evaluated.\r"

The incidence of preterm labor and delivery of a low birthweight infant was significantly higher in the teenagers. The incidence of preeclampsia was significantly higher in the adults. Cesarean delivery was not done more frequently in teenagers, nor was there a higher incidence of infants small for gestational age, anemia, and abnormal presentation in labor. The birthweight of infants of black teenagers was significantly lower than the birthweight of those of white teenagers, and overall birthweight was significantly lower in infants of teenagers than those of adults. Although prenatal care, socioeconomic factors, and racial balance were comparable for young teenagers and adults, teenagers were still at a significantly greater risk for delivery of smaller infants, preterm labor, and low birthweight infants.\r"

Of eight women with breast implants in whom breast cancer developed, six had mammograms before biopsy. Only two of the six cancers were identified mammographically (sensitivity = 33%), and one of these two was seen only in retrospect. In both cases, the mammographic findings suggested a benign rather than a malignant process. All eight women had a palpable mass and early disease, and all are clinically disease-free at present. The sensitivity of mammography in detecting palpable cancers in a control group of women without implants was 92% (118 of 128). For tumors of 2 cm or less, the sensitivity was 88% (58 of 66). These results suggest that the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer is decreased when implants are present. Further investigations are needed to determine the effects of prostheses on mammographic evaluations.\r"

Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic abscesses in 18 patients cured three and palliated 12 who were eventually cured by elective surgical ablation; three patients died. This compares well to our 15 surgical patients, of whom four were cured by surgery alone and six were palliated. All were subsequently cured by additional computerized tomography-guided or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and medical management or surgery. Five of the 15 died. Percutaneous drainage cured 11 of 14 infected pseudocysts and palliated two, which were subsequently cured by surgery; one was palliated but the patient was lost to follow-up. Surgical drainage cured six of 12 infected pseudocysts and palliated the other six, of which four were cured by further surgery and the other two were cured by secondary percutaneous drainage. Nine of 12 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by percutaneous aspiration, and two were palliated and later cured. In one patient, disease progressed, and he was ultimately lost to follow-up. Thirteen of 14 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by surgical drainage. The other patient died of pulmonary embolus. In patients treated by percutaneous techniques, there were four major complications. Our study established distinct advantages of percutaneous drainage under computerized tomographic and ultrasonic guidance: (1) the procedures can be carried out under ultrasonic guidance in an intensive care unit on critically ill patients, (2) the technique proved highly effective for initial palliation, with defervescence and stabilization occurring in most critically ill patients within 48 hours, (3) findings from fine needle aspiration provided valuable information as to microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivities and differed in 29 of 85 patients from those of concomitant blood cultures, and (4) definitive eradication of the process (surgical ablation of residual necrotic material) can be elected after the patient's clinical condition stabilizes.\r"

Core symptoms include lethargy, mucous membrane irritation, headache, eye irritation, and dry skin. To prompt a diagnosis of SBS, these otherwise common symptoms must be \"excessively\" reported and primarily \"work-related.\" The World Health Organization now estimates that 30% of new or remodeled office buildings show signs of SBS, and that between 10% and 30% of the occupants of these buildings are affected by SBS. Despite such figures, SBS remains poorly researched and even more poorly understood. The following review provides the clinician an overview of SBS that will allow a more accurate differential diagnosis and will help to prevent the widespread suffering that can accrue when SBS is not quickly recognized.\r"

We surveyed 263 junior and senior medical students, and our data support earlier surveys of the prevalence of alcohol abuse and indicate that students tend to drink less heavily and less frequently after entering medical school. The clinically proven CAGE questions used in the survey showed statistically significant associations between heavy or frequent drinking before and during medical school, but only 4.2% of respondents indicated that school officials had asked whether they had a drinking or drug abuse problem. Given these findings, we suggest the routine administration of screening instruments to medical students, using education and minimal intervention strategies with individuals at risk.\r"

  ".W": "The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 115 cases of cervical myelopathy, 121 cases of cervical radiculopathy, and 64 cases of neck pain with no neurologic deficit were prospectively studied to investigate the clinical value of MRI for cervical myelopathy. The MRI findings in the T1-weighted sagittal projection were classified into four groups according to the degree of the compressed deformities of the cervical cord. The degree of compression of the cervical cord on MRI findings showed a significant correlation with the severity of myelopathy, the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal column, and the degree of compression of the dural tube in the myelograms (P less than 0.01). Fifty-one patients of cervical myelopathy had undergone both preoperative and postoperative MRI. Of these, the spinal canal of 47 patients that was well decompressed was recognized according to plain computed tomography (CT). However, 24 (51%) of these 47 patients showed on MRI a deformity in the spinal cord amounting to cord atrophy. The correlation between the clinical function of the spinal cord and the recovery of the cord deformity on MRI at the operative levels was accurately investigated in 34 patients who had no cord deformities in the adjacent intervertebral levels. Twenty patients with cord atrophy had slightly poor clinical results, although no significant difference was found between these 20 and 14 patients with recovery in the cord deformities. From these results, it was evident that T1-weighted MRI is useful in the accurate diagnosis of compression myelopathy, in accurately deciding the level of the disease focus, and in the accurate assessment of the surgical results.\r"

These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP. Through motion analysis, the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities. The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is \"whip movement.\" Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects, especially at the upper cervical levels. Also, a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels, followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine. Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets. Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels. A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine, analogous to a cantilever, caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc.\r"

Even when 2-week-old donor rats were exposed to complete ischemia for 90 minutes, functions of the spinal cord were comparatively preserved. In histopathologic observations, degeneration proportional to complete ischemia duration was noted. In the 60-minute ischemia group of 2-week-old donor rats, however, no substantial differences from normal spinal cord were observed. Under conditions of equal ischemia duration, it appeared the younger animal had the greater ischemic tolerance.\r"

Each parameter ranged from 0 to 2 points. The total score obtained for each patient can be correlated with the prognosis, while being valuable in predicting it. However, the prognosis could not be predicted from a single parameter. In conclusion, an excisional operation should be performed on those cases who scored above 9 points, while a palliative operation is indicated for those who scored under 5 points.\r"

Five normal volunteers and 15 clinical cases with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) were examined. The SRP by the tibial nerve stimulation in the normal control group consisted of two kinds of potentials with different latency. Simultaneous electromyogram (EMG) recording from the stimulated muscles indicated that the shortest latency potential (first potential) was the ascending volley, including orthodromic afferent and antidromic alpha-efferent volleys; and that the long latency potential (second potential) was the descending volley of reflexively evoked alpha-efferents by the Group Ia afferents. The component of alpha-efferent fiber potential was recorded in the following two methods by changing the intensity of stimulation: 1) identifying alpha-efferent components in the first potential and 2) recording the second potential. Conduction blockage of spinal roots in 15 clinical cases was demonstrated as abnormal positivity and prolonged duration of the potentials. New methods were introduced to estimate two parameters quantitatively. The present study showed either of these signs in all patients tested. The examination was helpful to determine the level(s) of lumbar motor radiculopathies, and the extent of pathologic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "The biomechanical function of the iliolumbar ligament in the human lumbosacral junction was investigated by analyzing the three-dimensional movements of the whole lumbar and lumbo-sacral-ilium specimens. The experiment was repeated in the following three conditions: 1) intact iliolumbar ligament, 2) right iliolumbar ligament transected, and 3) bilateral iliolumbar ligaments transected. The representative values of the increased motions, compared with intact, after transection of the bilateral iliolumbar ligaments were 1.7 degrees (23%) in flexion, 1.1 degrees (20%) in extension, 0.3 degrees (18%) in axial rotation, and 1.2 degrees (29%) in lateral bending. The most restricted motion governed by the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction was lateral bending. The bilateral iliolumbar ligament specimen could restrict flexion and extension of the lumbosacral junction, but the unilateral iliolumbar ligament preparation alone could not restrict these motions. The iliolumbar ligament also had the function of restricting the rotational movement of the lumbosacral junction.\r"

  ".W": "In an in vitro experiment using fresh human lumbar functional spinal units, the effects of the division of the posterior ligaments (consisting of the supraspinous/interspinous ligaments) and graded facetectomies were investigated. The graded facetectomies consisted of unilateral and bilateral medial facetectomies, and unilateral and bilateral total facetectomies. Six kinds of moments were applied and ranges of motion (ROM) and neutral zones (NZ) were determined three-dimensionally by stereophotogrammetric methods. Range of motion was not affected by the division of the supraspinous/interspinous ligaments for all load modes. In flexion, ROM increased slightly after unilateral medial facetectomy. In right axial rotation, ROM increased after left unilateral total facetectomy. Range of motion was not affected, even by bilateral total facetectomies, in extension and lateral bendings. This study suggested that medial facetectomy does not affect lumbar spinal stability, and conversely, total facetectomy, even created unilaterally, makes the lumbar spine unstable.\r"

In cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy caused by dynamic canal stenosis, the authors found that the posterior slide of the vertebral body occurs as a result of degeneration in the cervical spine due to aging changes, and that the dynamic sagittal diameter of the spinal canal decreases with an increase of the degree of posterior slide. This is followed by gradual aggravation of the clinical symptoms. Continuous cervical traction was found to be the first choice of treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in cases in which the traction was ineffective, or even when it was effective, in cases in which the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score remained low or when there was a tendency toward rapid aggravation of symptoms. It was demonstrated that the shorter the duration of the myelopathy, the better the results of treatment obtained. A limit of the dynamic sagittal diameter of the spinal canal of 12 mm was considered as valid.\r"

Fifteen adult pig spines were tested with flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation torques applied to the upper end with the pelvis fixed. Instrumentation was applied across two lumbar segments and the lumbosacral level (L5-6, L6-7, and L7-S1). Stereophotogrammetry was used to track markers applied to each vertebra. Intersegmental motion was measured as three angles and as the relative linear translation of adjacent transverse processes and spinous processes. Results showed that all instrumentation systems reduced intersegmental motion compared with the control state, except for minimal reduction at L5-6 by Harrington instrumentation in all loading directions, especially axial rotation. The pedicle screw systems were always the most rigid. After applying instrumentation, there were differences in the motion occurring at different anatomic levels, most commonly with the least motion occurring in the middle of the instrumented segment (L6-7). When intervertebral motion was expressed as the linear motion between adjacent spinous and transverse processes, the usual site of posterolateral fusion, it was 0.6 to 1.8 mm per degree of angular motion at the transverse processes and 1.3 to 2.1 mm per degree at spinous processes.\r"

Of 297 screws, 17 broke, ie, 5.7%. These breakages occurred in 12 of 57 patients (21%). In patients with spondylolisthesis, the degree of slip correction averaged 53% postoperatively, which decreased to 35% at the 1-year follow-up. Slip angle was maintained after correction. Pedicle screw plate fixation is an effective form of immobilization of the lumbar spine used in achieving arthrodesis. The surgeon must be fully trained in methodology. It is recommended that screw and plate materials be improved to prevent screw breakage.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of unilateral single-disc herniation was extremely reliable, so myelography was considered to be unnecessary. Conversely, MRI findings of central single-disc herniation and multilevel disc herniation were less definite, in that myelography was necessary in locating the disc causing symptoms.\r"

Prospective ultrasound examinations were performed on 80 consecutive patients with clinically suspected lumbar disc herniation. In 41 discs of those 40 patients with surgically confirmed lumbar disc herniation, there were 32 discs (78%) with true-positive ultrasound diagnoses, 37 discs (90%) with true-positive myelographic diagnoses, and 20 patients (50%) with true-positive neurologic diagnoses. Conversely, ultrasound diagnoses showed positive echogram in 24 (60%) of 40 nonoperative patients. These results suggest that ultrasound is of value as an aid for diagnosing the level of lumbar disc herniation.\r"

After laser irradiation, intradiscal pressures (IDP) decreased and the nucleus pulposus was gradually replaced with cartilaginous fibrous tissue. The evaluation of heat distribution with thermocouples and thermography was done to determine safe optimum irradiating conditions and to develop a new double-lumen needle and a bare quartz fiber. Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser devices have been improved for easy and safe use, and a new tip type pressure transducer has been made for improved therapeutic results using this new method.\r"

In patients under 60 years of age, instability at the operated level tended to appear in cases of wide laminectomy more often than in cases of partial laminectomy. Occurrence or progress of instability seems to be promoted by resection of the posterior spinal elements rather than the disc. It is further considered that the postoperative aggravation of clinical symptoms may be influenced not only by instability, but also by the other factors.\r"

The spinal instrumentation provides instantaneous rigid fixation, and maintains it until fusion is obtained, which might prevent adhesion, new bone formation, and re-stenosis.

The authors examined changes in preoperative and postoperative lumbar ROM (range of motion), displacement of motor unit levels, and occurrence of instability in the remaining discs, such as horizontal and rotational displacement, in 26 patients who were followed up for a mean of 29 postoperative months; 13 patients had spondylolytic spondylolisthesis and 13 patients degenerative spondylolisthesis. The authors studied the effects of the fused vertebral angle and reduction of spondylolisthesis on the remaining upper and lower adjacent discs and the preoperative and postoperative fused disc heights. Intervertebral fusion must affect the remaining adjacent discs, but compensatory function of the remaining motor unit level was more influenced by the fused intervertebral angle than by repositioning of the spondylolisthesis. Fusion at a physiologically lordotic position is quite necessary. For this purpose, it is considered important to prevent grafted bones of the posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) from collapse and to maintain the achieved alignment of the lumbar spine.\r"

No progression of slippage was noted in patients who showed narrowing of the intervertebral disk, spur formation, subcartilaginous sclerosis, or ossification of ligaments. These suggest that the mechanisms of spinal restabilization prevent progression of the disease. General joint laxity was observed in many patients (65%), and this was believed to be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of this disease. There was no correlation between the clinical symptoms and progression of slippage. These findings suggest that careful consideration of the natural mechanisms of spinal restabilization as well as the natural course of the disease is important.\r"

The overall incidence of transfusion in this patient population declined from 6.2 to 3.2 percent during the study period (p less than 0.001). Slightly more than one-half (54.4%) of all transfusions were given in the operating room or recovery room. The majority of patients (68.4%) received 2 units of RBCs, 11.6 percent received a 1-unit transfusion, and 8.3 percent received 5 units or more. The most common obstetric diagnoses associated with RBC transfusion were disorders of placental implantation, preeclampsia, premature labor with tocolytic therapy, fetal distress, and augmentation of dysfunctional labor. In patients without risk factors for bleeding, there was no trend indicating increased transfusion requirements when general anesthesia was employed. In conclusion, this study documents a decline in the transfusion rate during cesarean delivery.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of these studies was to develop a cost-effective medium for the storage at 22 +/- 2 degrees C of platelets for transfusion. Platelet concentrates were prepared from platelet-rich plasma in a standard fashion and resuspended in 55 mL of medium. Residual plasma was 14.4 +/- 4.3 percent of the final suspending solution. The use of a simple solution containing electrolytes and citrate, but no glucose or bicarbonate, was associated with a drop in pH to the range of 6.0 to 6.6, as a result of the production of lactic acid from the platelet glycogen and glucose present in residual plasma. When 25 mM (25 mmol/L) sodium phosphate was included as a buffer, the drop in pH was retarded, but the range throughout storage was still 6.5 to 6.8. Nonetheless, platelets stored for 5 days in this phosphate-containing medium showed satisfactory maintenance of many in vitro variables. However, there was a 10 to 35 percent reduction of in vivo recovery after isotopic labeling. There was no significant reduction in subsequent mean cell life. Because of the in vivo abnormalities, these media are not recommended for use at the present time. However, the results are encouraging and suggest that further research may lead to a satisfactory, cost-effective medium.\r"

  ".W": "When a commercially available intravenous solution, plasmalyte-A, was added to platelet pellets as a platelet storage medium (PSM) after more than 85 percent of the plasma had been expressed, the platelets functioned equally well, after 5 days of storage, in platelet aggregation, release reaction, and serotonin uptake as did platelets stored in plasma. The level of fibrinopeptide A was significantly different in the PSM. Similarly, lower levels of kallikrein and complement components in the PSM-stored platelets indicated reduced activation of plasma enzyme systems. Morphology scores showed better shape maintenance in PSM, with values of 255 versus values of 185 in plasma (time zero, 280); electron microscopy also showed somewhat better structural maintenance in PSM. Glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production, and fatty acid oxidation were also reduced in PSM. No significant differences in pH, white cell count, pO2, pCO2, or lactic dehydrogenase were observed after 5 days of storage in plasma or PSM; however, platelet counts were reduced after 5 days in plasma but remained constant in PSM. The beta-thromboglobulin release was significantly lower in the PSM-stored platelets after 5 days. The volume of platelet membrane glycoprotein lb (which is responsible for platelet adhesion) decreased 15 percent in plasma following storage, whereas a decrease of only 5 percent was noted in PSM. There was less leaching of plasticizers in PSM than in plasma. Survival and recovery using 51Cr-labeled autologous platelets showed that, after 5 days of storage, the recovery of PSM-stored platelets was 63 percent and the survival was 7.7 +/- 0.8 days (multiple hit model).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Little information is available regarding the risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection for patients transfused before routine anti-HIV-1 screening of blood donors was instituted in March 1985. A model was developed for estimating both the proportion and the number of transfusion recipients in the San Francisco Bay area who were infected by HIV-1 during each of the 7 years preceding routine donor screening for anti-HIV-1. The model is based on analysis of 1) donation histories of HIV-1-infected donors identified at the regional blood center; 2) HIV-1 seroprevalence estimates for homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco; and 3) HIV-1 infection and survival rates for recipients traced by the Transfusion Safety Study and Irwin Memorial Blood Centers' Look Back Program. The incidence of transfusion-associated HIV-1 infection is estimated to have risen rapidly from the first occurrence in 1978 to a peak in late 1982 of approximately 1.1 percent per transfused unit. The decrease after 1982 coincided with the implementation of high-risk donor deferral measures. It is estimated that, overall, approximately 2135 transfusion recipients were infected with HIV-1 in the San Francisco region alone. This number suggests a higher prevalence of transfusion-associated HIV-1 infection than has been generally recognized and indicates the need for continued tracing of potentially exposed recipients. The data also strongly support the effectiveness of early donor education and self-exclusion measures and emphasize the importance of continued research and development in this area.\r"

  ".W": "Three third-generation white cell (WBC)-depletion filters based on polyester layers with decreasing pore size were investigated. In the coarse layers, unaggregated granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets and aggregates of these cells were captured in close contact with the fibers. This indicates that the depletion of granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets in the coarse layers of the filters is due in part to activation and adhesion with the formation of cell clusters on the fibers. In Filter I and Filter II platelets were not found in the fine layers, whereas in Filter III, 70 percent of the platelets were detected as unaggregated platelets on the fibers of the fine layers. More than 95 percent of the lymphocytes captured in the three filters occurred as single cells in the fine layers, and over 60 percent of these could be recovered. This suggests that the depletion of lymphocytes depended on trapping of the cells in the fiber network. All three filters captured HLA-DR-positive lymphocytes in the top layers, a finding that supports earlier reports that the transfusion of filtered red cell concentrates reduces HLA alloimmunization. More lymphocytes and granulocytes were found in the last layer of Filters II and III than of Filter I. Therefore, the risk of white cell leakage is probably lowest for Filter I. Red cells were found as red cell aggregates in the fine layers of Filters I and II, whereas almost no red cells were detected in Filter III. It was shown that the three filters studied were similar in their removal of WBCs, but differed in their mechanisms of removal.\r"

Pretransfusion hematocrit increased 49 percent by 3 to 5 days after the transfusion. Paired observations indicate a 14-percent drop in maternal oxygen consumption. There was a slight tendency for reduced posttransfusion cardiac output that resulted primarily from changes in maternal heart rate and not from changes in stroke volume. Left ventricular contractility also tended to decrease after transfusion. Neither fetal bradycardia nor alteration in the umbilical circulation by Doppler ultrasound was observed during the transfusion procedures. Despite substantial hematologic alterations, this procedure is associated with small or negligible changes in maternal hemodynamic and metabolic function for minimally symptomatic pregnant patients with sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".W": "RBC antibodies arising from transplanted organs and directed against recipient RBCs represent a well-established immunohematologic complication of solid organ transplantation. In ABO-unmatched organs, the frequency and severity of graft antibodies and hemolysis generally increase with the size (lymphoid content) of the organ, from kidney to liver to heart-lung transplants. In the cases reviewed here, the frequency of hemolysis increased in cyclosporine-treated kidney transplant recipients and O-to-A liver transplant recipients and decreased in group AB liver transplant recipients and kidney transplant recipients receiving azathioprine or low-dose postoperative graft irradiation. Available data cannot otherwise distinguish which cyclosporine-treated recipients of ABO-unmatched kidneys and livers (30-40% of total) will develop graft antibody. There has been no conclusive effect to date of the age, race, or gender of the donor or the recipient, of cadaver versus living kidney donors, or of patients' A2 or secretor status. In a few cases of living-donor kidney grafts, the donor was the patient's mother or wife who had been exposed to the recipient's RBC antigens via pregnancy. The ABO antibodies are typically IgG, appear 7 to 10 days after transplantation, and last for about a month. If immediate-spin crossmatching is done routinely, DATs are recommended in compatibility testing after ABO-unmatched transplants. Changes in the immunosuppressive regimen, such as a change from cyclosporine therapy, have not affected the duration of these antibodies. Most patients require only transfusions for this self-limited process, but six cases of hemolysis-induced acute renal failure have been reported, and one death was attributed to complications of hemolysis. RBC or plasma exchange has been performed in a few fulminant cases. RBCs of the donor's blood type are given when antibody appears. Some workers recommend such transfusion as prophylaxis at the time of surgery, although in liver transplants, the plasma accompanying a large amount of group O RBCs given perioperatively might be problematic. In several other centers, ABO-unmatched liver transplants have equivalent overall graft survivals, but the Pittsburgh adult patients with hemolysis have had reduced early graft survival. In the cases reviewed here, nine IgG Rh antibodies from kidney grafts directed against recipient RBCs have been observed, usually beginning 2 to 3 weeks after a cyclosporine-treated transplant, lasting for 2 to 6 months after operation, and causing mild hemolysis. One case represented a primary immune response from a previously unsensitized donor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To summarize the endocrine approach for the treatment of BPH: much clinical data have accumulated over the past forty years. Until recently, scientists and physicians mainly concentrated on the reduction of androgens as a possible solution. We have come a long way from surgical castration, through the administration of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to the inhibition of an enzymatic reaction reducing testosterone to DHT--the now recognized active intracellular androgen metabolite. Recently, the role of estrogens has been emphasized with the finding that stromal hyperplasia is the main change occurring in BPH. Lately, research has been initiated to examine the clinical effect aromatase inhibitors would have in the treatment of human BPH. Since there is enough evidence that both the epithelial and stromal components of the human prostate undergo hyperplasia in BPH, and individuals vary with respect to their relative epithelial/stromal components, both structures would have to be reduced for therapy to be successful. Therefore, the combination of an antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effect is theoretically promising. Indeed, prostates of beagles shrunken after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, further decreased in weight after additional treatment with cyproterone acetate, an antiandrogen. We are now approaching the stage where these \"antihormones\" are both enzyme inhibitors with actually no side effects that preclude the use of the earlier generation's \"antihormonal\" hormonal drugs. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxy-androstenedione also inhibits human prostatic 5-alpha reductase, at least in vitro. The in vivo relevance of this finding awaits further classification. Thus, a good hormonal treatment that will be both scientifically sound, and clinically safe and effective, seems feasible in the near future. Two main factors have encouraged our interest and research into methods of inhibiting prostatic growth or reducing its obstructive symptomatology: the enormous cost of prostatic operations for outlet obstruction secondary to BPH, and the natural aging process of the population accompanied by deteriorated health precluding anesthesia and prostatic surgery. Medical treatment of BPH has to result in symptomatic improvement, elimination of residual urine, and improvement of flow to be considered successful. These are usually accomplished by surgery and results at least as good as those obtained by operation should be aimed at, if medical treatment is to replace surgery. Although indications for surgery and outcome of operations are well-defined, this is not the case when alternatives to prostatectomy are chosen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Comparison was made between patients who had TURP within the six months preceding prostatectomy (n = 54) and those who had needle biopsy (n = 437) prior to operation. No significant differences were noted in local recurrence of disease, systemic progression of disease, disease-free interval, and overall and cause-specific survival, even after adjustment for clinical (adjuvant treatment) and pathologic prognostic variables. Our data suggest that for patients with pathologic Stage C prostate cancer treated by radical surgery, preoperative TURP is not associated with unfavorable outcome.\r"

Neurostimulation via wire electrode in the S3 foramen produced good sphincter closure.

The therapeutic principles of neurostimulation applicable to patients with spastic bladders are underscored by these 2 cases.\r"

No difference in activity levels was seen in 73.9 percent of the nonchemotherapy patients. Fifty-one percent of the men were very active as compared with only 19.1 percent of the women, whereas 20 percent more women than men were moderately active and 13 percent more were sedentary.

  ".W": "Although the salient features of renal oncocytomas and renal cell carcinomas have been discussed in the recent literature, renal masses with features of both entities will present diagnostic difficulty, especially when the cells are diffusely eosinophilic on microscopic examination. A case of a firm, tan, rounded mass replacing the lower pole of the kidney is discussed. The final diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, granular cell type, was made after multiple sections of the tumor were examined, and after electron microscopy was performed. A thorough search by light microscopy should be made for clear cell foci, necrosis, mitotic activity, and vascular or capsular invasion, features generally accepted as pathognomonic for renal cell carcinoma. Cellular and especially nuclear pleomorphism is typically focal or mild in renal oncocytomas. True oncocytic tumors will be packed with mitochondria on electron microscopy; however, granular renal cell carcinomas will contain mitochondria as well as other cellular organelles, lipid, and glycogen. Electron microscopy should be performed on tumors suspected of being oncocytomas because eosinophilia on hematoxylin and eosin stain, as demonstrated by this case, is not a predictable measure of mitochondria content. Immunoperoxidase staining for vimentin in oncocytomas has recently been shown to be negative, and may offer a method of ruling out oncocytoma in vimentin-positive tumors, pending further studies.\r"

Prior to presentation, the patients had received different antimicrobial agents; the symptoms disappeared only to recur whenever the drug was discontinued. After repeated failure, the patients were treated with gentamicin to which the organisms were sensitive, via the anal submucosal route. A daily injection was given for ten days on an outpatient basis. The technique of injection is described. The patients were followed up clinically and by segmented cultures for three years. No anorectal complications were encountered as had been demonstrated experimentally. The symptoms of chronic prostatitis disappeared, and culture was negative by the end of treatment and for two to three years thereafter in all patients. It appears that the antimicrobial agent, via anal route, reaches the prostatic tissues at a higher concentration than that of the serum. The route adopted by the drug to reach the prostate from the anal submucosa is presented.\r"

  ".W": "To better assess the construction, maintenance, and function of the Kock ileal urinary reservoir with its continent antirefluxing nipple valves, laboratory investigations in dogs were done simultaneously with clinical trials in humans in 1983. Fifteen dogs underwent creation of hemi-Kock ileal reservoirs (without the efferent valve and limb) that were anastomosed to their bladders as enterocystoplasties. The afferent antirefluxing nipple valves were intussuscepted after 7 cm of underlying mesentery had been removed. The nipples were further stabilized with metal and absorbable (Polysorb) staples and Marlex collars. The right ureters were anastomosed to the afferent limb of the reservoirs with the contralateral systems left intact as controls. Ten dogs were able to be followed at the vivaria for twelve to thirty-six months and then studied. All nipple valves remained intact, viable, and nonrefluxing without revision. All kidneys remained histologically normal except those in dogs with dilated ureters secondary to ureteroileal stenosis with concurrent calculi formation. Calculi formed on exposed metal staples and Marlex. The absorbable staples were found to promote appropriate healing and were never the nidus for stone formation. It appears that the intussuscepted nipple valve (with its mesentery removed) is reproducible and functionally reliable in preventing reflux. It also appears these valves can histologically preserve diverted kidneys if the upper urinary tract drainage is normal and calculi are minimized. The proper placement of staples and the elimination of Marlex-anchoring collars are indicated to minimize calculi.\r"

  ".W": "The predictors of 5-year cardiac survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were analyzed in a series of 637 consecutive patients. The average age was 59 +/- 11 years in 472 men and 165 women. Diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction and unstable angina were present in 119 (19%), 261 (41%) and 305 (47%) patients, respectively. Angiographically, 460 patients had 2-vessel and 177 patients had 3-vessel CAD. The left ventricular contraction score was greater than or equal to 12 in 55 patients. Angiographic success (less than 50% residual stenosis) was achieved in 85% of the 1,343 narrowings and clinical success was obtained in 526 (83%) of the 637 patients. Complete revascularization was obtained in 177 (34%) of 526 successful patients. Procedure-related complications resulted in death in 9 patients (1.4%), in Q-wave myocardial infarction only in 6 patients (0.9%) and in emergency bypass surgery in 44 patients (6.9%) (of whom 10 had Q-wave myocardial infarction). Follow-up for greater than or equal to 1 year and up to 6 years after PTCA was obtained in 608 (95%) of the 637 patients. To determine the predictors of 5-year cardiac survival, 28 clinical, angiographic and procedural variables were analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards regression. The estimated 5-year survival after PTCA was 88 +/- 2% in successful patients and 77 +/- 5% in patients in whom PTCA was unsuccessful (p less than 0.001). When clinical success was forced into the Cox regression, the left ventricular contraction score of greater than or equal to 12, diabetes mellitus and age greater than or equal to 65 years showed additional adverse effects on survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of collateral vessels during coronary occlusion, defined as partial or complete epicardial opacification by collateral vessels of the vessel dilated, was related to clinical, angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters. The angiographic appearance of collateral vessels during balloon inflation showed a weak, although statistically significant, correlation to the percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty (r = 0.28; p = 0.03) and the duration of angina (r = 0.37; p = 0.004). By combining lesion severity with the duration of angina, collateral vessels during coronary occlusion were particularly related to a lesion severity greater than or equal to 70% and duration of angina greater than or equal to 3 months (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of collateral vessels was associated with an absence of ST-segment shift (greater than or equal to 1 mm) during 1 minute of coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001).\r"

Hospital mortality was 7.4% for black and 13.1% for white patients (p = 0.07). However, after adjustment for key demographic and clinical variables by logistic regression, this difference was not as apparent (p = 0.38). Questions about the premature onset of coronary artery disease, excess systemic hypertension, and the differential use of interventions in black persons have been raised by other investigators. Despite differences in age, referral patterns and the use of coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery, black and white patients with AMI in metropolitan Seattle had similar outcomes.\r"

The study group included 169 men and 31 women (mean age 58.4 years [7% greater than 70 years]). Sixty-four percent of patients had severe angina (New York Heart Association class IV), 70% had 3-vessel coronary artery disease and 21% had poor left ventricular function. Reoperation was performed after a mean interval of 58 months after the first procedure. A mean of 3.3 distal anastomoses was placed. The operative mortality rate (30 days) was 7.5%, with additional cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, heart failure) in 11.5% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk in women (risk ratio 3.6) and in patients with poor left ventricular function (risk ratio 3.1). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was estimated at 84%, with a rate of 77% for patients with poor left ventricular function (difference not significant). The probability of remaining free of a cardiac-related event (myocardial infarction, angioplasty, third operation, cardiac death) was 64% for 5 years. At the end of follow-up, 79% of the surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II and nearly 50% of patients in the fifth year after the reoperation had good functional status. It is concluded that a reoperation is effective but carries an increased, immediate, operative risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To develop a suitable and practical marker for clustering, we evaluated 380 consecutive patients at the time of coronary angiography. Analyses of lipid, rheologic, clinical and arteriographic profiles indicated a variety of interwoven relations. Because the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (total/HDL cholesterol) was closely related to both the presence and extent of greater than or equal to 50% diameter reduction of greater than or equal to 1 coronary arteries, it was used to divide patients into quartiles. Clustering of high- and low-level risk factors was demonstrated in the highest and lowest quartiles of total/HDL cholesterol, respectively (p less than 0.001). The highest quartile may be characterized by an only moderately elevated total cholesterol level but patients in this quartile may have a very low HDL cholesterol level, high triglycerides, a tendency toward high hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels, a history of smoking, previous myocardial infarction and multivessel disease. These results suggest that total/HDL cholesterol serves as a marker not only for obstructive coronary disease but also for a cluster of potentially modifiable risk factors.\r"

LV ejection fraction and 3 parameters of LV diastolic function were measured with radionuclide ventriculography, whereas MR was assessed with Doppler echocardiography. LV ejection fraction was normal in 11 (27%) and depressed in 29 (73%) patients. Moderate or severe MR without LV diastolic dysfunction was common and equally prevalent in patients with and without LV systolic dysfunction (33 vs 38%; difference not significant). Diastolic dysfunction without MR was less frequent but equally prevalent in patients with and without systolic dysfunction (17 vs 27%; difference not significant). Two (18%) of 11 patients without and 12 (33%) of 36 patients with LV systolic dysfunction had both MR and LV diastolic dysfunction. Furthermore, MR was clinically silent and unsuspected in two-thirds of all patients with MR, regardless of a normal or depressed systolic function. These data show that there is a high prevalence of unrecognized moderate to severe MR in patients with acute pulmonary edema, regardless of the presence or absence of LV systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction without MR is relatively low even in patients with normal LV systolic function and pulmonary edema. Thus, unrecognized MR may be an important contributor to the syndrome of acute pulmonary edema in patients with normal or depressed LV systolic function.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen infants aged less than 1 month presented to our institution during the last 22 years with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or accelerated ventricular rhythm and a structurally normal heart. In 2, VT was associated with long QT syndrome. Both are alive on beta-blocker therapy, 1 with an implanted pacemaker. Twelve infants had accelerated ventricular rhythm, and 2 of these died in the first 2 months of life of unrelated conditions. The other 10 are alive at a median age of 4 years (range 2 months to 11 years), and none were lost to follow-up. Hemodynamic compromise did not occur with accelerated ventricular rhythm. The ventricular rate was very close to the sinus rate in all 12, less than 12% above the sinus rate. The mean QRS duration during accelerated ventricular rhythm was 92.5 ms, and averaged twice the QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Fusion beats were seen in all 12, and there was atrioventricular dissociation with capture beats in 10. In 2, ventriculoatrial conduction was present. Treatment was attempted in 5 of the 10 survivors with accelerated ventricular rhythm, and was thought to be successful in 4. Treatment was later successfully withdrawn in all 5, so that all 10 survivors were free of accelerated ventricular rhythm and were not receiving antiarrhythmic medications at last follow-up. Because of the excellent long-term outcome and the lack of hemodynamic compromise during the rhythm, it seems reasonable to withhold antiarrhythmic therapy in infants with accelerated ventricular rhythm and await resolution of the rhythm.\r"

Segmental analysis of the planar thallium-201 images was performed in a blinded fashion with agreement by consensus. Computerized quantitative analysis of the images also was independently performed, and was correlated with the visual interpretations. Forty-seven patients (51%) had normal images, and 46 (49%) had defects of greater than or equal to 2 segments. In the abnormal studies, only 13 patients (14% of the total population) had septal defects, while a much higher number of patients, 33 (39%), had inferior or apical defects, or both. Coronary angiography was performed in 6 patients with septal defects: Significant narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery was found in 4 patients, a narrowed right coronary artery was found in 1, and normal coronary arteries were seen in the other patient. In conclusion, whereas previous studies have suggested a high percentage of false-positive septal defects in patients with left BBB, this study demonstrates a low prevalence (14%) of septal defects in a large population of unselected patients presenting for exercise thallium-201 imaging. Therefore, exercise thallium-201 imaging remains a useful procedure for evaluating patients with complete left BBB.\r"

Beats 31 to 21 were designated as a period of stable arrhythmia and served as a reference for changes occurring just before termination. Forty-four episodes of VT occurred in the setting of antiarrhythmic drug therapy; 11 episodes occurred in patients not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Variability in cycle length was indexed by the standard deviation of the mean cycle length and by the percentage of consecutive cycles varying by greater than or equal to 40 ms (% greater than or equal to 40 ms). There was greater variability just before termination (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 25.8 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 16.7%) than during the stable period (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 8.5 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 5.4%; p less than 0.001 for both). This was true irrespective of antiarrhythmic drug use, although the differences in the standard deviation of the mean cycle length for beats 11 to 1 and for beats 31 to 21 were greater for the antiarrhythmic drug group (29.6 vs 8.9 ms, p less than 0.001) than for the group not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs (11.0 vs 6.7 ms, difference not significant).

There were no significant differences in the risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death or death due to coronary artery disease according to QTc. A similar lack of significant association between QTc and these 3 outcomes was observed among all persons studied and in the 2 sexes after using a multiple regression analysis to control for several potentially confounding characteristics including age, gender, cigarette smoking, serum total cholesterol, systolic systemic blood pressure and Framingham relative weight. The results of this study fail to demonstrate an association between baseline QTc and overall mortality, and deaths due to sudden cardiac events or coronary artery disease in a large population-based cohort of essentially healthy persons in whom pathologic forms of QTc prolongation are uncommon.\r"

No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug. Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group.

Recent work, however, has led to the development of agents that directly inhibit renin, the proximal step in the cascade. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects of renin inhibition in 9 patients with chronic CHF by using enalkiren, a primate-selective, dipeptide renin inhibitor, which has been previously shown to suppress plasma renin activity and to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The acute intravenous administration of enalkiren (1.0 mg/kg) produced increases in cardiac index (2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 liter/min/m2) and stroke volume index (26 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 4 ml/m2) and decreases in left ventricular filling pressure (31 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg), mean right atrial pressure (15 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg), heart rate (78 +/- 5 to 72 +/- 6 beats/min) and systemic vascular resistance (2,199 +/- 594 to 1,339 +/- 230 dynes.s.cm-5) (all p less than 0.01 to 0.05). These observations indicate that renin inhibition produces hemodynamic benefits in patients with chronic CHF and could potentially provide a novel approach to interfering with the renin-angiotensin system in patients with this disorder.\r"

At baseline, plasma renin activity did not correlate with any hemodynamic parameter. However, norepinephrine levels had a weak correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01), stroke volume index (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05). Plasma renin decreased with bucindolol therapy, from 11.6 +/- 13.4 to 4.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml/hour (mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.05), whereas plasma norepinephrine was unchanged, from 403 +/- 231 to 408 +/- 217 pg/ml. A wide diversity of the norepinephrine response to bucindolol was observed with reduction of levels in some patients and elevation in others. Although plasma norepinephrine did not decrease, heart rate tended to decrease (from 82 +/- 20 vs 73 +/- 11 min-1, p = 0.059) with beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting neurohormonal antagonism at the receptor level. No changes in I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake occurred after bucindolol therapy, suggesting unchanged adrenergic uptake of norepinephrine with beta-blocker therapy. Despite reductions in plasma renin activity and the presence of beta blockade, the response of renin or norepinephrine levels to long-term bucindolol therapy did not predict which patients had improved in hemodynamic status (chi-square = 0.37 for renin, 0.82 for norepinephrine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at follow-up angiography was 4.4% in thrombolytic and 10.5% in nonthrombolytic candidates (p less than 0.002). Ejection fraction improved most in patients with anterior wall AMI (7.7% in thrombolytic candidates, 15.1% in nonthrombolytic candidates) and in patients with reperfusion times greater than 6 hours (14.2%). These outcomes suggest that direct coronary angioplasty is a viable alternative method of reperfusion in patients with AMI who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Nonthrombolytic candidates are a high-risk group of patients. Direct coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in certain subgroups, especially for patients in cardiogenic shock and for patients presenting greater than 6 hours after the onset of chest pain with evidence of ongoing ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial thromboembolism is a serious complication in patients after heart valve replacement. Abnormalities in blood rheology may contribute to this complication. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare various determinants of blood rheology in patients with substitute heart valves with those in healthy controls; furthermore, differences between patients with mechanical valves and those with bioprostheses should be investigated. The hemorrheologic determinants--fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, hematocrit and platelet aggregation--were studied in 92 patients with mechanical bileaflet valves, in 28 patients with bioprostheses and in 29 control subjects; the time since valve replacement was greater than or equal to 9 months. Fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell and spontaneous platelet aggregation were found to be increased in all patients after heart valve replacement compared with normal subjects (fibrinogen: 348 +/- 87 vs 267 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.71 +/- 0.1 vs 1.66 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.05; red cell aggregation: 9.9 +/- 2 vs 7.8 +/- 2 U, p less than 0.01; platelet aggregation: 22 +/- 15 vs 13 +/- 13%, p less than 0.01); among patients, fibrinogen, plasma viscosity and spontaneous platelet aggregation were higher in mechanical valves than in bioprostheses (fibrinogen: 359 +/- 95 vs 314 +/- 41 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.72 +/- 0.1 vs 1.68 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.1; platelet aggregation: 23 +/- 15 vs 16 +/- 11%; p less than 0.05), whereas no difference could be found for red cell aggregation (9.7 +/- 2 vs 10.5 +/- 2%, p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Little data are available on the hemodynamic effects of premedications and anesthetic agents on infants and children. Ketamine is the most frequently used anesthetic agent for cardiac catheterization procedures in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Previous reports both suggest and deny ketamine's pulmonary vasoreactive effects. Since the advent of sophisticated noninvasive equipment, one of the few indications for cardiac catheterization is to obtain accurate pressure data. If ketamine alters pulmonary vascular resistance, it would negate the primary reason for the procedure. Because the patient population studied herein resides greater than or equal to 1,200 meters above sea level, concerns about pharmacologic effects on pulmonary vascular resistance are enhanced. Simultaneous pulmonary artery and aortic pressures, thermodilution cardiac outputs, and blood gases were measured in room air (16% oxygen) and with ketamine infusion in 14 patients at cardiac catheterization. Reaction to hypoxia identified 3 groups: normal, intermediate and hyperresponders. The normal responders had normal resistance ratios (0.11) in room air and had little resistance ratio response to hypoxia (+0.02), hyperoxia (-0.03) or ketamine (+0.01). The intermediate responders had a slightly higher but normal resistance ratio (0.20) in room air, and a moderate reaction to hypoxia (+0.13), hyperoxia (-0.08) and ketamine (+0.11). The hyperresponders had an elevated resistance ratio (0.42) in room air and a striking reaction to hypoxia (+0.65), hyperoxia (-0.17) and ketamine (+0.49). Hypoxia and ketamine have a greater effect on resistance ratio than hypoxia alone in patients with reactive pulmonary vascular beds. Ketamine should not be used in children undergoing procedures to establish operability based on pulmonary vascular resistance or pulmonary vascular reactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently develop hepatic dysfunction. Although hepatic injury may indirectly result from malnutrition, hypotension, administered medications, sepsis, or other conditions, the hepatic injury is frequently due to opportunistic hepatic infection, directly related to AIDS. Infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare typically occurs in patients with advanced immunocompromise and with systemic symptoms due to widely disseminated infection. In contrast, hepatic tuberculosis often occurs with less advanced immunocompromise. Cytomegaloviral infection may produce a hepatitis. Cytomegaloviral and cryptosporidial infections have been implicated as causes of acalculous cholecystitis and of a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. About 10-20% of patients with AIDS have chronic hepatitis B infection. These patients tend to develop minimal hepatic inflammation and necrosis. The clinical findings in patients with hepatic cryptococcal infection are usually due to concomitant extrahepatic infection. Hepatic histoplasmosis usually develops as part of a widely disseminated infection with systemic symptoms. Hepatic involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely documented ante mortem because an unguided liver biopsy is an insensitive diagnostic procedure. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver typically have lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and systemic symptoms. As a pragmatic approach, patients with liver dysfunction and HIV-related disease should have a sonographic or computerized tomographic examination of the liver. Patients with dilated bile ducts should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography because opportunistic infection may produce biliary obstruction. Patients with a focal hepatic lesion should be considered for a guided liver biopsy. Patients with a significantly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level should be considered for a percutaneous liver biopsy. When performed for these indications, liver biopsy will demonstrate a significant disease involving the liver in about 50% of patients with AIDS and in about 25% of patients who are HIV seropositive but who are not known to have AIDS. The clinical impact of a diagnostic biopsy is blunted by a lack of efficacious therapy for many opportunistic infections.\r"
