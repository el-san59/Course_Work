Presently, histocompatibility differences in living related vs cadaver donors and degrees of HLA mismatching among recipients of cadaveric kidneys are major factors. Immunization by transplant rejection is the second most important factor.\r"

When testosterone or prednisolone was administered with CyA as a combination therapy to young male and adult female recipients, the survival time of the graft was significantly prolonged. On the contrary, estradiol totally inhibited the immunosuppressive activity of CyA in any recipients. These present data strongly suggested that immunoreactivity against transplantation antigens can be influenced by sex steroid hormones, and that the usage of steroid combination therapy may overcome the lack of immunosuppression by CyA induced by the female sex steroid estradiol.\r"

Depending on the characteristics of the local population and individual medical risk factors, a reaction (induration) between 5 and 15 mm (or more) generally represents infection. Isoniazid therapy in persons with positive skin tests will decrease the risk of disease by 60 to 80 percent. Family physicians will play a critical role in efforts to eliminate tuberculosis from the United States by the year 2010.\r"

Several tests are now available to rapidly identify group B streptococcal carriers. Physicians should be able to recognize patients at high risk for colonization and the situations in which prophylactic antibiotics should be employed. Proper use of antibiotics during labor can eliminate group B streptococcal sepsis in neonates.

  ".U": "91118823\r", 
  ".W": "Recent intervention trials during myocardial infarction demonstrated no benefit from emergency angioplasty after thrombolytic therapy when compared with either delayed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or a conservative strategy. However, it is possible that subgroups of patients may benefit from early intervention with angioplasty. We performed a prospective randomized trial in patients with a patent infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy to determine whether initial flow grade is related to infarct-zone function and whether patients with ineffective reperfusion (greater than 90% stenosis or Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow less than or equal to 2) might benefit from immediate PTCA. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 170 patients at a mean of 2.1 +/- 0.5 hours after onset of myocardial infarction. A patent infarct-related artery that was suitable for angioplasty was present in 89 patients who comprised the study group; after randomization, 47 of 50 patients with a patent infarct-related artery had successful emergency PTCA 3.8 +/- 1.5 hours after onset of symptoms, and 39 were scheduled for delayed (18 to 48-hour) PTCA. Reocclusion occurred before the scheduled (delayed) procedure in eight patients (20.5%), and was symptomatic in six. Infarct-region function (by the centerline method) measured initially, before discharge, and at 4 months was similar in both groups; improvement was significant (p less than 0.001) at discharge when compared with initial values with no further change at 4 months. However, patients with ineffective reperfusion had greater hypokinesia initially (p less than 0.05) compared with those with effective reperfusion (less than or equal to 90% stenosis plus TIMI flow 3). Moreover, independent of the timing of PTCA, improvement was greater before discharge in patients with ineffective reperfusion (p less than 0.05) with a trend also evident at 4 months. Importantly, 42 of 51 patients (82%) with a residual lumen less than 0.4 mm after thrombolysis had some improvement in function at discharge; this compared with a previous study in which patients with a similar degree of stenosis (without PTCA) had no improvement. Moreover, reocclusion occurred before scheduled (delayed) PTCA in 37% of patients with greater than 90% stenosis compared with only 5% in those with less than or equal to 90% stenosis (p = 0.02). Thus flow grade is an important determinant of myocardial function in patients with a patent artery after thrombolytic therapy and is predictive both of improvement in wall motion after PTCA and early reocclusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Forty-four patients (49%) had stable angina and 46 (51%) had unstable angina. The estimated duration of occlusion was 87 +/- 78 days in patients with stable angina, as compared with 10 +/- 8 days in patients with unstable angina (p less than 0.001). Abrupt vessel closure during PTCA occurred only in patients with unstable angina (0% versus 17%, p less than 0.05). The major complication rate was 2.5% in the stable angina group, and 20% in unstable angina group (p less than 0.01). This rate was also significantly higher than the complication rate of 8% observed in 442 procedures that were performed during the same period in patients with the unstable angina and nonocclusive stenosis (p less than 0.01). Patients with unstable angina who undergo PTCA of a totally occluded artery represent a subset of high risk for major complications.\r"

To test this hypothesis we compared collagen in canine hearts stunned by repeated occlusion with collagen in hearts stunned by a single occlusion. Regional contractile function was equally depressed in both groups: segment shortening at 1 hour after reperfusion averaged 37% +/- 9% versus 32% +/- 9% of preocclusion values in repeated and single occlusion models, respectively. Midmyocardial collagen content was not different in either single occlusion (10.5% +/- 0.4%) or repeated occlusion models (9.5% +/- 0.7%) when compared with nonischemic hearts (8.5 +/- 0.8%). Collagen damage, which was revealed with polarized light microscopy, was seen in 5 of 6 dogs after repeated occlusion but was not apparent after a single occlusion. Thus although both models of stunned myocardium produce similar dysfunction, there was no apparent collagen loss. Furthermore, collagen damage was only seen after repeated occlusion. Therefore it appears unlikely that collagen damage is a primary mechanism of stunned myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) has been shown to reduce experimental infarct size. To examine the role of PICSO in limiting the consequences of brief ischemia on left ventricular function, we studied the effect of PICSO in nine open-chest anesthetized dogs. PICSO was performed using a pump-inflated, balloon-tipped catheter in the coronary sinus until coronary sinus occlusion pressure reached a plateau (10 +/- 3 seconds). The balloon was then rapidly deflated (2 seconds) and the cycle was repeated. Regional left ventricular function in the ischemic zone was assessed by sonomicrometry. Coronary blood flow was measured with a flow probe around the left anterior descending artery (LAD) proximal to an occluding suture. Measurements were obtained at baseline, during a 3-minute LAD occlusion, and for 10 minutes of reperfusion. In an additional five dogs, this sequence was repeated during an infusion of adenosine at a dose that abolished reactive hyperemia following LAD occlusion. The addition of PICSO beginning 15 minutes prior to ischemia and continuing throughout LAD occlusion and reperfusion did not prevent, reduce, or shorten ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. PICSO uniformly blunted reactive hyperemia during reperfusion. However, PICSO also reduced coronary blood flow during maximal vasodilatation achieved by adenosine infusion prior to LAD occlusion. Therefore, it is likely that PICSO decreases reactive hyperemia due to mechanical factors arising from venous engorgement rather than by reducing the ischemic stimulus causing vasodilation.\r"

One patient had evidence of unique homocollaterals represented by enlarged vasa vasorum, which created a vascular cuff that surrounded a totally obstructed left main artery. The ventricular function and hemodynamic parameters in these patients not only depend on the collateral vessels but may also be affected by the severity of coronary artery disease in the artery that supplies collaterals.\r"

Also, the effects of combining various end points (recurrent nonfatal or fatal infarction and other cardiac death) in multivariate analyses, a practice common in many small studies that evaluate the predictive-value of various treatments or special tests, was examined. In univariate analyses, patients with nonfatal recurrent infarction did not differ with respect to age or gender from infarct-free survivors, but they more often had a history of previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, and diabetes; more severe pulmonary congestion was present on chest x-ray during the admission, and a non-Q wave index infarction was more frequent. Patients with either a fatal or nonfatal recurrent infarction had more angina pectoris during follow-up (55% to 60%) compared with 27% in event-free survivors and 31% in patients who died of other cardiac causes in whom this factor could be assessed before death. In multivariate analyses, historical and clinical prognostic factors were ranked differently for fatal or nonfatal reinfarction and other cardiac causes of death; angina pectoris at follow-up was highly related to recurrent infarction (fatal or nonfatal), along with a history of diabetes, and a non-Q wave index infarction. These factors were not independently related to other causes of cardiac death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dipyridamole/delayed ratio of the left ventricular dimension from the thallium-201 image was defined as the left ventricular dilatation ratio (LVDR). An LVDR greater than the mean + two standard deviations in patients without coronary artery disease was defined as abnormal. Twenty-two of 83 patients showed an abnormal LVDR, and 18 of the 22 patients (82%) had triple-vessel disease. By defect and washout analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying the patients as having triple-vessel disease was 72% and 76%, respectively, whereas LVDR had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 93%. When LVDR was used in combination with the defect and washout criteria, sensitivity increased to 84% without a loss of specificity. In those 22 patients with abnormal LVDRs, end-diastolic volume measured by radionuclide angiography did not change after dipyridamole infusion. Dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging reflected relative subendocardial hypoperfusion induced by dipyridamole rather than actual chamber enlargement. The LVDR was moderately sensitive and highly specific for triple-vessel disease and provided complementary information to dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging.\r"

There were 22 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 51 +/- 14 years (range, 27 to 74). Hemodynamic and angiographic findings were evaluated before and after PMV and clinical status was assessed at follow-up. There was a significant decrease in mitral gradient following PMV, from 15.4 +/- 5.1 to 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than .0001); an increase in cardiac output, from 4.6 +/- 1.1 to 5.2 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than .01); and an increase in calculated mitral valve area, from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.0001). Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in severity in six patients (24%). At the time of follow-up (mean, 12 +/- 5 months), three patients required elective mitral valve replacement for symptomatic mitral regurgitation and 91% (20 of 22) of the remaining patients had continued improvement in functional class. PMV can safely be performed in properly selected patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis with good immediate and follow-up results.\r"

Data were analyzed from 67 consecutive patients who were undergoing continuous-wave Doppler examination and catheterization with micromanometer catheters. Doppler pressure half-time was calculated as the interval between peak transmitral velocity and velocity divided by the square root of 2, as measured from the outer border of the spectral envelope. Doppler mitral valve area (MVA) was obtained with the equation: MVA = 220 divided by pressure half-time. For catheterization data, the pressure half-time was measured directly from simultaneously recorded left ventricular and left atrial pressure (18 patients) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (49 patients). The catheterization half-time was taken as the time required for the peak pressure gradient to fall to one half of the initial value. Calculations of the mitral valve area at catheterization were obtained by the Gorlin equation with pressure gradient and cardiac output determinations. Mitral valve area as determined by the Gorlin equation for all cases ranged from 0.4 to 2.0 (mean = 1.03 +/- 0.37) cm2. Linear regression analysis that compared cardiac catheterization and Doppler half-times yielded r = 0.68. For the subgroup of patients with sinus rhythm, the correlation improved to r = 0.76.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with severe mitral regurgitation were excluded. In patients with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAS) less than 70 mm Hg (n = 33), there was good correlation between the mitral valve area derived from Doppler echocardiography and from cardiac catheterization (r = 0.85). However, in patients with PAS greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg (n = 17), this correlation was not as good (r = 0.57). In these 17 patients, the Gorlin formula tended to underestimate the valve orifice area (mean valve area 0.85 +/- 0.49 and 1.06 +/- 0.46 cm2 by catheterization and by Doppler respectively, p = NS). Direct measurement of the valve area by two-dimensional echocardiography was possible in 12 of the 17 patients and correlated well with Doppler values (r = 0.91). Hence in the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension, Doppler pressure half-time estimation of mitral valve area is more accurate than is catheterization-derived valve area, using the wedge pressure and the Gorlin formula.\r"

We assumed pacing of the right ventricular apex to be a suitable model of this conduction defect. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) was inducible in 16 of 48 patients with intrinsic LBBB and in 23 of 39 patients with pacing-induced LBBB. Utilizing a filter setting of 25 to 250 Hz, late potentials were defined as a total filtered QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 msec, a root mean square voltage in the terminal 40 msec (RMS 40) of less than or equal to 25 microV, and the duration of signals less than 40 microV (LAS 40) of greater than or equal to 38 msec. Only RMS 40 and LAS 40 criteria were used in patients with LBBB. Prolongation of LAS 40 and fragmentation of signals in the terminal portion of the filtered QRS were characteristic of all patients with LBBB aberration. Of those patients with intrinsic LBBB, the mean total filtered QRS duration, RMS 40, and LAS 40 for inducible and noninducible patients were significantly different (170 +/- 28, 16 +/- 10, 55 +/- 24, and 153 +/- 18 msec, 25 +/- 10 microV, 33 +/- 16.9 msec; p = 0.04, 0.009, and 0.007, respectively). Noninducible patients with a normal QRS duration demonstrated a 60% decrement in the mean RMS 40 value during pacing-induced LBBB. These changes resulted in a 59% false positive incidence of late potentials during pacing-induced LBBB. This correlated with a similarly low mean RMS 40 value in patients with intrinsic LBBB and no inducible SMVT, hence giving rise to a false positive incidence of late potentials of 63%. Since \"standard\" RMS 40 and LAS 40 criteria resulted in low specificity and positive predictive value, new parameters were selected and analyzed. The combination of RMS 40 less than or equal to 17 microV plus LAS 40 greater than or equal to 55 msec yielded the best overall statistical result, with a sensitivity, specificity, and total predictive accuracy of 69%, 81%, and 77%, respectively. In conclusion: (1) A reduction of RMS 40, prolongation of LAS 40, and fragmentation of signals in the terminal portion of the filtered QRS are characteristics of LBBB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Each patient's spontaneous variability (SV) was evaluated by linear regression analysis of hour-to-hour changes in ectopy during 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring. The response to a single oral dose of disopyramide, 300 mg, flecainide, 200 mg, and propafenone, 450 mg, was measured during a trial lasting 4 hours. Lidocaine was administered intravenously in incremental doses of up to 4 mg/min and was evaluated over 3 hours. Threshold values of ventricular arrhythmia corresponding to 95% confidence limits were calculated from baseline recordings and were used to ascertain the likelihood of a true drug effect. The minimum decrease in hourly ectopy indicating arrhythmia suppression averaged 90.9%, while an increase of at least 947% was required for a proarrhythmic effect. When these efficacy criteria were applied, 16 of 50 short-term tests revealed no drug effect. In contrast, when a 70% threshold derived from studies of daily variability was employed, only 7 of 50 trials were negative. Thus individual determination of hourly arrhythmia variability yields more stringent criteria than extrapolation from day-to-day spontaneous variation.\r"

The ventricular effective refractory period was measured at a basic drive cycle length of 500 msec with basic drive train durations of two beats, eight beats, 20 beats and 3 minutes. The ventricular refractory periods were measured in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the drive train duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness by 5% (p less than 0.001) at each drive train duration. Mexiletine did not affect the ventricular effective refractory period at any of the drive train durations. In a control group of 20 subjects, there were no significant differences between two determinations of refractoriness at each basic drive train duration. In conclusion, neither quinidine nor mexiletine affect the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. Although the ventricular effective refractory period measured with a conventional basic drive train duration of eight beats is often more than 20 msec longer than the actual ventricular effective refractory period measured with a drive train duration of 3 minutes, the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the conventionally measured ventricular effective refractory period accurately reflect the effects of these drugs on the actual ventricular effective refractory period.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with systemic hypotension and sinus bradycardia that were initially refractory to conventional therapy responded well to intravenous calcium administration. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed immediate reversal of severe left ventricular dysfunction after intravenous administration of calcium in two instances. Common factors were hyperkalemia and verapamil therapy. This interaction was examined further by evaluation of contractility, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure in anesthetized dogs. Controls (n = 9) received saline infusion, and a second group (n = 10) received saturated potassium chloride (approximately 0.2 ml/min intravenously). In control dogs, administration of verapamil (1195 +/- 181 micrograms/kg intravenously) reduced systemic arterial pressure from 113 +/- 7 mm Hg to 74 +/- 5 mm Hg, and heart rate from 147 +/- 9 beats/min to 86 +/- 11 beats/min. Potassium chloride infusion alone increased blood [K+] from 3.4 +/- 0.1 to 6.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/L, but was without hemodynamic effects. In hyperkalemic dogs, a significantly lower dose of verapamil (428 +/- 42 micrograms/kg intravenously) reduced systemic arterial pressure from 102 +/- 8 mm Hg to 36 +/- 4 mm Hg, and heart rate from 150 +/- 5 beats/min to 104 +/- 15 beats/min. Myocardial contractile function was examined with right ventricular isometric contractile force and left ventricular segment length changes. In normokalemic and hyperkalemic groups, contractility was decreased by verapamil. Effects of verapamil on arterial pressure and contractility could be reversed significantly by administration of calcium, 0.4 mEq/kg intravenously. The present results support the theory that the negative hemodynamic effects of verapamil may be exaggerated to a harmful degree by concomitant hyperkalemia. These adverse events may be reversed by calcium administration.\r"

The influence of gender on the systolic blood pressure response to dynamic exercise was independent of exercise modality. Men had a higher systolic blood pressure in spite of the fact that they had similar sympathetic nervous system response as indicated by urinary norepinephrine excretion. Gender differences in systolic blood pressure responses were altered when adjusted for body weight, body surface area, and lean body mass.\r"

A three-phasic response of developed pressure was noted: 0 to 100 microliters balloon volumes resulted in an increase in developed pressure, whereas developed pressure remained constant at 250 microliters and fell at 400 microliters. Oxygen consumption and [Ca2+]i transients followed the same pattern as developed pressure and coronary flow. Intraventricular volumes of 250 microliters or greater (a volume overload) caused endocardial ischemia, a greater decrease in extracellular versus intracellular water, thinning of the left ventricular free wall, and an increase in chamber size. Mechanical pressure on the tissue, induced by the volume overload, caused ischemia as further evidenced by (1) a negative effect on developed pressure, (2) a decrease in [Ca2+]i transients, (3) a [Ca2+]i overload, (4) a moderate decrease in the phosphorylation potential, and (5) an increase in the oxidation-reduction state (nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide). The high intracellular calcium associated with volume overload may have been due to both compression and ischemia, which leads to an increased number of cross-bridges in rigor, a high end-diastolic pressure, and an increase in wall stress.\r"

Sixty minutes after a 100 mg oral dose of flosequinan, the peak rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) increased from 940 +/- 180 to 1050 +/- 240 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05), while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 32 +/- 5 to 26 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), and cardiac index increased (2.1 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, (p less than 0.05). The mean pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance decreased from 40 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 330 +/- 240 to 290 +/- 170 dyne-sec/cm5 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Heart rate, mean aortic pressure, right atrial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and serum norepinephrine levels did not change significantly. The increase in left ventricular peak dP/dt that was concomitant with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and no change in systemic arterial pressure or sympathetic tone, argue for a direct positive inotropic effect of flosequinan.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether dilated cardiomyopathy in the fox is associated with dietary taurine deficiency. A total of 68 foxes from farms with a history of death caused by dilated cardiomyopathy and 14 foxes from a farm with no history of dilated cardiomyopathy were studied. Dilated cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by echocardiography in 48% of the foxes from one farm with a positive history and in none of the foxes from the control farm. Foxes less than 9 months of age were more commonly affected than older foxes (p = 0.03). Plasma taurine concentrations were significantly less (p less than 0.01) in foxes that had dilated cardiomyopathy (26.8 +/- 16.4 nmol/ml) than in the control foxes (99.3 +/- 60.2 nmol/ml). A significantly higher (p less than 0.01) incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy was present in foxes with a history of a sibling or offspring that died of dilated cardiomyopathy than in foxes without a family history of cardiac death. In one fox with dilated cardiomyopathy that was tested, the myocardial taurine concentration was lower (1.7 mumol/gm wet weight) than that of control foxes (7.3 +/- 1.6 mumol/gm wet weight). Hepatic cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase activity was significantly less (p less than 0.001) in foxes with dilated cardiomyopathy (0.97 +/- 0.2 nmol/mm.mg protein) than in control foxes (2.11 +/- 0.07 nmol CO2/mm.mg protein).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this paper is to present the short- and long-term results of prosthetic valve replacement in children. During a 7-year period that ended in April 1985, 186 children, ages 1 to 20 years, underwent valve replacement; there were 55 (30%) aortic valve replacements, 95 (51%) mitral valve replacements, and 36 (19%) multiple valve replacements. Ninety-four percent of the lesions were rheumatic in origin, 4% were congenital, and 2% were infectious. Of 223 valves replaced, 175 (78%) were mechanical valves and 48 (22%) were heterografts; the latter were in the mitral position in all but three patients. Surgical mortality rates were 3.6%, 4.2%, and 19.4% respectively for aortic valve, mitral valve, and multiple valve replacements. Five-year actuarial survival was 91% for aortic valve replacement, 82% for mitral valve replacement and 60% for multiple valve replacement. Major events included reoperation in 34 (with three deaths), progressive myocardial failure that led to death in 10, sudden unexpected death in two, thromboembolic complications in 19 (death in five), subacute bacterial endocarditis in five (two deaths), and bleeding that required transfusion in two patients. Five-year complication-free actuarial survival rates were 83% for aortic valve replacement, 63% for mitral valve replacement, and 57% for multiple valve replacement. The respective five-year complication-free survival rates were 83%, 48%, and 43%. Significant morbidity and mortality rates are associated with valve replacement. Therefore every effort should be made to preserve the native valve by plastic reparative procedures. When prosthetic replacement of mitral valve is contemplated, our data would suggest that heterografts should not be inserted in children 15 years of age or younger, although heterografts may be used in children over 15 years of age with the expectation of valve survival comparable to that of mechanical valves. When complications that are associated with anticoagulant therapy were reviewed, platelet inhibiting drugs seem quite satisfactory in patients with aortic valve replacement; patients with mitral valve replacement seem to require warfarin therapy, and warfarin must be used in patients with multiple valve replacement to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.\r"

Thirty-four of 690 total cases of sudden cardiac death were sports-related, which represents 5% of sudden cardiac death in this age group. Causes of death were severe atherosclerosis (nine), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry (eight), coronary artery anomalies (four), idiopathic concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (three), myocarditis (two), arrhythmogenic right ventricle (one), Kawasaki disease (one), and unknown (six); two of the cases with unknown causes had tunnel arteries. Exercise-related deaths were more likely due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0007) compared with 102 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls in the non-exercise group; there was no difference in the incidence of severe atherosclerosis (p = 0.4). The mean age of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry was less than that of those with severe atherosclerosis (24 vs 32 years, p = 0.03). Thus exercise precipitates sudden cardiac death in younger individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

This system allows the beat-to-beat detection of low-amplitude signals at the bedside in a nonshielded room without any averaging process. Analysis was performed in 39 normal subjects (group A: 27 men, 12 women, mean age, 28 +/- 8 years), in 98 patients with coronary artery disease without documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (group B: 86 men, 12 women, mean age, 59 +/- 10 years) and in 41 patients coronary artery disease with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (group C: 36 men, 5 women; mean age 63 +/- 9 years). Comparison was made with time-domain signal-averaging (SA-ECG) in all cases at the same electrode position and with identical band-pass filtering. In group A no VLPs were detected; the total filtered QRS duration was 84 +/- 8 msec (mean +/- SD), and the time interval during which the terminal QRS did not exceed 40 microV (I-40) was less than 30 msec in all cases (mean, 17 +/- 6 msec). In group B, VLPs were detected by HR-ECG in 34 of 98 patients (35%); the total QRS duration was 102 +/- 16 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A), and the I-40 was 29 +/- 13 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs (group A). In group C, VLPs were detected by HR-ECG in 38 of 41 patients (93%); the total QRS duration was 123 +/- 22 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A and group B), and the I-40 was 40 +/- 14 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A and group B). Concordant results between HR-ECG and SA-ECG were observed in 91% of the cases (59 positive and 103 negative results). Late potentials that exhibited dynamic variations were detected by HR-ECG alone in 13 cases, and very low amplitude VLPs were detected by SA-ECG alone in three cases. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of body-surface recording of VLPs on a beat-to-beat basis, without any averaging process, at the bedside in a nonshielded room. This new approach may allow the study of dynamic changes of VLPs during spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias or ischemia.\r"

Every 2 years they were examined, categorized according to causal blood glucose samples obtained at the clinic visit, reclassified for development of CVD and diabetes mellitus, and followed 10 years for CVD. During the follow-up period, 350 men and 369 women developed CVD. Age-adjusted CVD rates were positively associated with glucose levels in nondiabetic women who did not develop diabetes during follow-up. No such associations were seen in men. Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent association of blood glucose levels with later CVD in nondiabetic women. This study shows that hyperglycemia in the original Framingham cohort is an independent risk factor for CVD in nondiabetic women, but not among men.\r"

Many patients may derive particular benefit from early cardiac catheterization and angiography, including: (1) patients with AMI complicated by recurrent myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias; (2) patients with abnormal or inconclusive results of noninvasive testing or those patients unable to perform an exercise test; (3) patients with abnormal left ventricular global systolic function and those with increased left ventricular end-systolic volume; (4) \"young\" patients (younger than 50 years of age?); (5) older patients (older than 65 to 70 years of age?); (6) patients with non-Q wave AMI; and (7) patients who are receiving thrombolytic therapy. Performance of early cardiac catheterization and angiography in virtually all survivors of AMI, with selective use of appropriate noninvasive tests, may provide a more efficacious means of risk assessment after AMI; if all tests are performed judiciously, the cost of such an approach need not be excessive. A combination of invasive and selected noninvasive tests probably provides optimal information. The risks to the routine performance of diagnostic cardiac catheterization and angiography in all survivors of AMI are: (1) adequate care and attention may not be paid to proper performance of the procedure(s) and to detailed and proper analyses of the data; (2) the need for additional noninvasive testing in selected patients may be ignored; and most importantly, (3) premature or unnecessary revascularization procedures may be performed subsequently. For optimal patient care, the clinician must obtain all necessary data, avoid unnecessary and repetitive tests, know the accuracy of individual tests at his or her own facility, interpret all data in proper context, and then counsel patients objectively about available management strategies. With this approach, all patients who might appropriately benefit from coronary artery revascularization will be correctly identified, and patients who are truly at very low risk (minimal residual coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function particularly if associated with a patent infarct-related artery) may be similarly identified and managed appropriately with elimination of unnecessary additional testing and pharmacologic therapy. Finally, whatever approach to risk stratification one chooses for an individual patient, the importance of and the need to correct and/or ameliorate risk factors for coronary artery disease must be recognized and undertaken.\r"

However, the time required for thrombolysis and the possibility of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. Herein are described experimental animal studies and clinical evaluations in which attempts have been made to develop adjunctive therapies that, when coupled with available thrombolytic interventions, might shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent reocclusion. From the studies conducted to date, it is clear that a combined thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist and heparin shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models with copper coil-induced coronary artery thrombi. A monoclonal antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor coupled with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and heparin also shortens the time to thrombolysis and delays or prevents reocclusion in experimental canine models. Thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and synthetic inhibitors, given with t-PA and aspirin, appear to shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models. Aspirin coupled with intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality in patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction, and a combination of heparin and t-PA results in infarct-artery patency more frequently than t-PA without heparin. Data from these studies are encouraging with regard to the possibility of developing effective and relatively safe thrombolytic regimens that shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion.\r"

  ".W": "Procoagulant activity may persist during coronary thrombolysis and result in either delay in the time to recanalization or recurrent thrombosis. Although heparin and aspirin form the mainstay of current therapy, recurrent thrombosis occurs despite adjunctive heparin therapy during thrombolysis. Newer agents that inhibit thrombin by antithrombin III-independent mechanisms, or that inhibit earlier steps in the coagulation cascade, have been shown to be effective in the experimental preparation of coronary thrombolysis. Because heparin-antithrombin III is a relatively inefficient inhibitor of thrombin bound to fibrin, agents such as hirudin or small peptide inhibitors of the thrombin-active site appear to be more effective inhibitors of clot-associated thrombin activity. Inhibition of early steps in the coagulation cascade with the inhibitor of tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, or with activated protein C, also appears to be an effective anticoagulant strategy. In experimental preparations all of these agents have shown superiority in preventing recurrent thrombosis compared with heparin, and in some cases they appear to accelerate the rate of clot lysis.\r"

  ".W": "The rationale for considering heparin therapy as an adjunct to thrombolytic treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction is to prevent rethrombosis after successful thrombolysis. The risk of reocclusion is high immediately after thrombolysis because blood flowing through the newly opened coronary artery is exposed to thrombin bound to fibrin in the residual thrombus. Clinical studies of patients with venous thrombosis and acute myocardial infarction indicate that there is a relation between the anticoagulant response to heparin and clinical efficacy and that the concept of a therapeutic heparin level is valid. Subcutaneous doses of approximately 15,000 U twice a day fail to provide an adequate anticoagulant response at 24 hours in the majority of patients, whereas intravenous administration of a bolus of 5,000 U followed by continuous infusion of 30,000 U per 24 hours produces an adequate anticoagulant response at 24 hours in approximately 80% of patients. Studies of patients with myocardial infarction who received streptokinase showed a significant beneficial effect on mortality when 12,500 U of heparin was administered subcutaneously 2 times per day. In contrast, the single largest study evaluating heparin 12,500 U administered subcutaneously 2 times per day as an adjunct to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment did not show a beneficial effect on mortality. However, studies using full-dose intravenous heparin therapy demonstrated that heparin improves patency after coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI. Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs. When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs. Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was lower among patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI (5 of 141 vs 0 of 60; difference not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The use of noninvasive tests to detect coronary artery vasculopathy was studied in 73 consecutive patients after heart transplant. Angiographically or autopsy-proved coronary artery disease was noted in 19 consecutive patients (26%) followed prospectively for 2.5 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- standard deviation). Patients underwent yearly surveillance echocardiographic, rest/exercise-gated wall motion, oral dipyridamole thallium, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor and angiographic studies. Positive test results were defined by decrease in ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality, failure to increase ejection fraction, lack of systolic blood pressure increase, and ischemic ST changes at maximal exercise (or on ambulatory monitor). Wall motion abnormalities and depressed ejection fraction on echocardiography were also abnormal studies as were fixed or reversible perfusion defects on thallium scan. Angiograms were considered positive when 50% luminal narrowing was observed and autopsy coronary artery vasculopathy was defined as cross-sectional coronary obstruction greater than or equal to 70%. No procedure that was examined proved to be a sensitive noninvasive detector of heart transplant coronary artery vasculopathy. All except ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring had positive predictive values less than 50%. Interestingly, of the techniques evaluated, echocardiography was most sensitive (53%). The poor predictive ability of noninvasive testing in this population may be due to the fact that these tests are designed to detect effects of ischemia rather than coronary obstruction alone. Use of these particular noninvasive modalities routinely after heart transplant to detect coronary artery vasculopathy should be reconsidered because of their low sensitivity and predictive value when used as a surveillance screen.\r"

Dilatation was attempted in 734 lesions (mean 1.5 per patient), of which 95 (13%) were chronic total occlusions. Overall, 69% of the 734 lesions were judged anatomically complex, and, in dilating these lesions, a rail-type device was used almost exclusively. Successful dilatation was achieved in 659 of the 734 (90%) attempted lesions. There were low incidences of the major complications of death (0.4%), myocardial infarction (1.8%) and emergency bypass surgery (1.8%). Acute rethrombosis occurred in 54 patients (11%). In these patients, initial strategy of repeat dilatation was successful in 38 of 47 patients (81%). Overall, primary clinical success at PTCA was achieved in 480 patients (95%). At a mean follow-up of 7.5 +/- 1.5 months in 497 of the study patients, the event-free rate (freedom from cardiac death, myocardial infarction, repeat PTCA or coronary bypass surgery or recurrence of severe [class III to IV] angina) was 71%.

Fifty-one patients (88%) had no change in the extent of MR (less than or equal to 1+) and 6 patients (10%) had a 1-grade decrease in their MR; only 1 patient had a 1-grade increase in MR.

There was a steeper mitral early deceleration slope (-3.59 +/- 1.07 vs -2.95 +/- 0.91 m.s-2) but no significant difference in pressure half-times across the 2 valves (47 +/- 7 vs 51 +/- 12 ms, p less than 0.1). No influence of gender or body surface area could be demonstrated. There was a weak but significant relation between mitral peak early, peak atrial velocity and E:A ratio and age (r = -0.39, p less than 0.001, r = 0.23, p less than 0.01, and r = -0.245, p less than 0.01, respectively). There was no significant correlation between any of the tricuspid flow parameters and age. Respiration caused pronounced variability in the tricuspid Doppler indexes and all tricuspid flows were sampled and analyzed only during inspiration. The intra- and interobserver variabilities were small for all of the Doppler indexes measured, but the day-to-day variability was quite significant especially for the pressure half-time, deceleration and acceleration slope values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

LV size, mass and function were studied using echocardiography and systolic time intervals in 78 middle-aged male alcoholics who also gave detailed accounts of the duration of heavy drinking, the quantity of recent ethanol consumption and the duration of abstinence. Compared with 34 healthy nonalcoholics, alcoholics had a higher LV mass index (85 +/- 2 [mean +/- standard error] vs 77 +/- 2 g/m2, p = 0.001), a thicker posterior wall (11 +/- 0.2 vs 10 +/- 0.2 mm, p = 0.02), a longer end-systolic diameter index (18 +/- 0.3 vs 17 +/- 0.3 mm/m2, p = 0.02), and a higher preejection period/ejection time ratio (0.36 +/- 0.01 vs 0.33 +/- 0.01, p = 0.002). In multivariate linear regression models, these abnormalities proved independent of the drinking history, except that posterior wall thickness was weakly related to the duration of heavy drinking (standardized correlation coefficient 0.36, p = 0.01). Univariate analyses suggested that the LV mass index and systolic time interval ratio had, if anything, a curvilinear relation to the total duration of heavy alcohol consumption. It is concluded that the LV hypertrophy and dysfunction found in alcoholics are poorly related to the duration and severity of self-reported alcohol abuse. Together with other data, this suggests that there is no simple linear dose-injury relation in the long-term cardiotoxicity of ethanol. Factors modifying the myocardial effects of ethanol need to be studies more in the future.\r"

It correctly categorized all patients with ostium secundum and ostium primum ASD but misdiagnosed 3 of 5 patients with surgically proven sinus venosus ASD. The shunt flow volume across the ASD was calculated with the standard Doppler equation, and assuming the ASD to be circular correlated with shunt flow volume obtained by cardiac catheterization (r = 0.74). The maximum width of the color flow signals moving across the ASD was taken as its diameter. Mean flow velocity was determined either by placing a pulsed Doppler sample volume parallel to the flow across the ASD as visualized by color Doppler or by color M-mode examination, which allowed determination of flow velocities using a previously validated method that incorporates a computer analysis of pixel color intensity. The pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio obtained by color-guided conventional Doppler interrogation of the left and right ventricular outflow tracts correlated poorly with cardiac catheterization results (r = 0.38). In patients with associated tricuspid regurgitation, the peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure obtained by color Doppler-guided continuous-wave Doppler correlated well with that obtained at cardiac catheterization (r = 0.89). The maximum color Doppler jet width of the flow across the ASD poorly correlated with ASD size estimated at surgery (r = 0.50).\r"

A prospective study of 84 elderly blacks (70% women) and 326 elderly whites (73% women) with hypertension correlated echocardiographic and electrocardiographic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with incidences of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary events and atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI). Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.02) and concentric LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.001) were more prevalent in hypertensive blacks than in hypertensive whites. Hypertensive blacks were younger (78 +/- 9 years) than hypertensive whites (82 +/- 7 years) (p less than 0.001). Other coronary risk factors were similar, except for higher serum triglycerides in whites than in blacks (p less than 0.02). Follow-up was 37 +/- 18 months in blacks and 43 +/- 18 months in whites (p less than 0.01). Incidences of CHF and coronary events were not significantly different in blacks and whites. ABI incidence was 38% in blacks and 21% in whites (p less than 0.005). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that prior CHF (p = 0.000), concentric LV hypertrophy (p = 0.018) and echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.022) were independent risk factors for CHF. Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.001), serum total cholesterol (p = 0.002), concentric LV hypertrophy (p = 0.005) and prior coronary artery disease (p = 0.042) were independent risk factors for coronary events. Prior ABI (p = 0.001), echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.001) and electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.034) were independent risk factors for ABI.\r"

Phase I denoted 10 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil; phase II denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 4 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride; and phase III denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil. Blood samples for the determination of verapamil concentrations were drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes, and at 2, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours. Blood pressure, heart rate and PR intervals were also measured at these times. Pretreatment of verapamil with intravenous calcium did not alter the disposition of intravenous verapamil. Blood pressure was not significantly altered in any treatment phase, although calcium tended to increase mean arterial pressure and verapamil abolished this effect. Calcium had no significant affect on verapamil-induced PR prolongation (maximum percent change in PR interval: phase I = 19 +/- 11%, phase III = 18 +/- 7%; time to maximal prolongation: phase I = 0.38 +/- 0.21 hours, phase III = 0.37 +/- 0.26 hours; and area under the percent change in PR vs time curve: phase I = 15.5 +/- 10, phase III = 21 +/- 9). Verapamil caused a reflex increase in heart rate of similar magnitude in both phases I and III (24 +/- 10% and 21 +/- 7%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
