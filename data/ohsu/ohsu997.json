  ".W": "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are caused by defects in dystrophin synthesis. Using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-dystrophin antibodies, we have studied immunohistochemically the subcellular localization of dystrophin in embryonic, fetal, and adult human skeletal muscle. In the embryonic stages dystrophin first appears in the sarcoplasm at the peripheral ends of the myotubes, immediately adjacent to the tendons, whereas in fetal stages dystrophin is found throughout the entire myofibers. In agreement with literature data, in adult muscle dystrophin expression was found to be restricted to the sarcolemma. The sarcoplasmic localization in embryonic and fetal tissue and the sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin in mature muscle suggests the accumulation of dystrophin in the cytoplasm prior to its integration into the membrane. These results increase our knowledge of the ontogenesis of dystrophin and may lead to a better understanding of the great diversity in pathological cases of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.\r"

All presented with paresthesias, weakness, and Lhermitte's phenomena, and exhibited signs of sensorimotor polyneuropathy, ataxia, and arreflexia. Two had subnormal serum vitamin B12 levels. Baseline electrophysiologic testing revealed reduced motor unit potentials, prolonged F wave latencies, absent H reflexes, denervation potentials, and delays in motor and sensory conduction. Three had peripheral and nuchal delay after median nerve stimulation. All were reevaluated after 3 to 12 months' abstinence and treatment with vitamin B12, and all showed substantial clinical improvement. Parallel improvement in electrophysiologic findings occurred, but residual minor conduction delays, loss of H reflexes, electromyographic evidence of denervation, or abnormalities of posterior tibial SEP were noted. These findings confirm the reversibility of myeloneuropathy of nitrous oxide abuse and describe the profile of electrophysiologic recovery in subjects who abstain from further neurotoxic exposure.\r"

Trains of rectangular electric pulses (RPT) with constant amplitude and frequency or sine waves, both the amplitude and frequency of which were modulated and controlled by a computer (MSWT), were used with each animal. MSWT closely reproduced the physiological shape of transdiaphragmatic pressure waves. Diaphragm fatigue, as determined from the decrease in the maximal relaxation rate of twitches, occurred after 20 minutes of bilateral or unilateral nerve stimulation with RPT, but only after 60 min (unilateral stimulation) or 98 min (bilateral stimulation) with MSWT. These data show the importance of the motor signal pattern in long-lasting nerve stimulation.\r"

All were assumed to have the same metabolic defect. The disease is a multisystem disorder with a metabolic defect located at complex 1 in the respiratory chain. Clinically, the disorder gives symptoms such as hearing loss, retinal pigmental degeneration, ataxia, cardiomyopathy, muscular fatiguability and neuropathy. The patients were investigated with nerve conduction studies, concentric needle EMG, SFEMG, and macro EMG examinations. Neurophysiologic studies revealed signs of myopathy in both the younger members and in those with slight muscular symptoms. In the more advanced stages, neuropathic changes of the axonal type were seen as well. Macro EMG was interpreted as indicating muscle fiber membrane abnormalities in the early stages. Single fiber EMG studies indicate that this metabolic defect does not disturb neuromuscular transmission.\r"

  ".W": "The mdx mouse, although a genetic and biochemical homologue of human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), presents a comparatively mild histopathological and clinical phenotype. These differences are partially attributable to the greater efficacy of regeneration in the mdx mouse than in DMD muscle. To lessen this disparity, we have used a single dose of X-irradiation (16 Gy) to inhibit regeneration in one leg of mdx mice. The result is an almost complete block of muscle fiber regeneration leading to progressive loss of muscle fibers and their replacement by loose connective tissue. Surviving fibers are mainly peripherally nucleated and, surprisingly, of large diameter. Thus, X-irradiation converts mdx muscle to a model system in which the degenerative process can be studied in isolation from the complicating effect of myofiber regeneration. This system should be of use for testing methods of alleviating the myofiber degeneration which is common to mdx and DMD.\r"

To determine the relevance for diagnosis of these tests and side-to-side comparison, the results were compared in patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica and normal subjects. The long-term outcome was also considered, in order to determine whether electrophysiologic findings contribute to the prognosis. In our study, SNAP amplitude comparison was found to be more useful for diagnosis than SNCV and SEP latency comparisons. However the value of the SNAP amplitude on the affected side, just as the results of the other tests, was not found to be predictive of the outcome. Also the results of the tests depend on the methods used and on the nerve's route.\r"

A significant decrease in water permeability was recognized in the MyD erythrocyte membrane, and impaired Na pumping was suspected to be correlated with the former biochemical abnormalities in band III protein of MyD erythrocyte membrane. Significant acceleration of glycolysis in the erythrocyte for the first 160 minutes was also recognized in MyD; however, the production of lactate showed no difference between MyD and controls. The increased glucose uptake in MyD may be compensatory to the diminished pumping mechanism, but further information, such as inorganic phosphate permeability and the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of erythrocyte glycolysis, is needed.\r"

Five out of 5 single motor units recorded from the right biceps were normal. An upper motor neuron lesion affecting the left arm, predicted by our results, was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a lesion in the right precentral gyrus. It appears that changes in single motor unit firing characteristics, caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, can be detected at a time when there is no evidence of increased \"tone\" and/or hyperreflexia (spasticity) in the affected extremity.\r"

A reduction in fiber diameter might explain the decrease in the maximal tension in the soleus, whereas this tension was unaltered in the gastrocnemius and the plantaris. Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations, indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C. The tension/pCa relationship appeared unaltered in the plantaris after spaceflight. Finally, the studies of the time to reach a steady tension indicated an increase in the rate of force development in the soleus and, on the contrary, a slowing down in the plantaris. No change in the gastrocnemius was found. The results were analyzed with references to the different muscle functions in disuse atrophy.\r"

As the force of voluntary contraction increases from low to moderate levels, the number of turns in the signal increase faster than does the mean amplitude change between turns. This results in a cloud that is concave downward. At higher force levels, the pattern is reversed. The overall shape of the cloud thus depends on the maximum effort at which recordings are made, which is determined by the procedure of muscle activation.\r"

Oral rehydration with solutions based on rice powder may reduce stool output as well as restore fluid volume. METHODS. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of two rice-based rehydration solutions and a conventional glucose-based solution. Solution A contained only rice-syrup solids, solution B contained rice-syrup solids and casein hydrolysate, and solution C, the glucose-based solution, served as control. The study subjects were 86 mildly to moderately dehydrated infant boys, 3 to 18 months old, who were admitted to a children's hospital with acute diarrhea. We measured fluid intake, fecal and urine output, and absorption and retention of fluid, sodium, and potassium at intervals for 48 hours in all 86 infants. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SE) fecal output was significantly lower in the infants given solution A (group A infants) than in the infants given solution C (group C) (29 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 7 ml per kilogram of body weight, P less than 0.05) during the first six hours of therapy. The infants in group A also had greater fluid absorption (221 +/- 16 vs. 167 +/- 9 ml per kilogram, P less than 0.05) over the entire 48 hours of therapy and greater potassium absorption (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol per kilogram, P less than 0.05) during the first six hours than the infants in group C. Solution B offered no advantages over solution A. CONCLUSIONS. Solutions containing rice-syrup solids were effective in the rehydration of infants with acute diarrhea. They decreased stool output and promoted greater absorption and retention of fluid and electrolytes than did a glucose-based solution.\r"

Possible explanations include the exacerbation of preexisting abnormalities in the secretion or action of vasopressin and abnormally large increases in plasma vasopressinase activity. METHODS. We studied two women in whom overt polyuria and polydipsia developed during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappeared after delivery. The secretion and action of vasopressin were studied both when the women had polyuria and polydipsia and later, when their water intake and urine volume were normal. RESULTS. One patient had partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. She had little increase in urine osmolality in response to water deprivation, hypertonic-saline infusion, and vasopressin injection and no response to desmopressin acetate (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) during the immediate postpartum period. Her basal and stimulated plasma vasopressin concentrations were high (16.5 to 203.4 pmol per liter) before and during hypertonic-saline infusion 30 months post partum. The other patient had partial neurogenic diabetes insipidus. She had subnormal basal plasma vasopressin concentrations, a subnormal increase in the plasma vasopressin level and a subnormal decrease in urine flow in response to the administration of vasopressin, and a normal response to desmopressin. After pregnancy, when her urine volume was normal, she had no increase in plasma vasopressin in response to hypertonic-saline infusion, but she had a normal rise in the plasma vasopressin level and a normal renal response to vasopressin administration. CONCLUSIONS. Pregnancy may unmask subclinical forms of both nephrogenic and neurogenic diabetes insipidus. This exacerbation may result from both increased vasopressinase activity and diminished renal responsiveness to vasopressin.\r"

Despite continuing concern about aluminum toxicity, aluminum-containing antacids are still used in many of these patients as phosphate-binding agents. Although maximal acceptable doses of aluminum hydroxide have been recommended, the safety and efficacy of these guidelines have not been evaluated. METHODS. Seventeen children and young adults (mean [+/- SD] age, 14.1 +/- 3.7 years) undergoing regular peritoneal dialysis were randomly assigned to treatment with either aluminum hydroxide (n = 7; maximal dose, 30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or calcium carbonate (n = 10; dose range, 2.5 to 12 g per day, according to serum phosphorus levels). Aluminum retention was assessed by serial measurements of plasma aluminum, deferoxamine-infusion tests, and measurements of bone aluminum content during a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 13 +/- 2 months. The evolution of bone disease was also evaluated. RESULTS. Plasma aluminum levels and the increment in plasma aluminum after infusion of deferoxamine increased from base-line values in the patients treated with aluminum hydroxide, and aluminum-related bone disease developed in one patient. Serum phosphorus levels remained higher and serum calcium levels lower in the patients receiving aluminum hydroxide than in those receiving calcium carbonate. The skeletal lesions of secondary hyperparathyroidism improved in 7 of 10 patients receiving calcium carbonate but persisted or progressed in 6 of 7 patients given aluminum hydroxide (P less than 0.025). CONCLUSIONS. Aluminum hydroxide is less effective than calcium carbonate as a phosphate-binding agent for the control of hyperphosphatemia and is associated with aluminum retention in children and young adults with chronic renal failure who are receiving dialysis therapy.\r"

After a steep rise in the 1970s, the annual number of physicians receiving licenses increased at a slower rate. The numbers of new board diplomas in medicine and primary care continued to grow. In other non-surgical clinical specialties there was less growth, and in certain fields of surgery the numbers declined. The board-certified percentage of all practitioners increased slightly (74 to 79 percent). About 14 to 16 percent of all active physicians are still in their residency and fellowship years. The percentage of all practitioners under the age of 35 who are women has increased from 8.4 percent in 1967 to 25.2 percent in 1986. The enrollment of some residency programs is currently more than 50 percent women. CONCLUSIONS. The work force of physicians did not grow as rapidly in the 1980s as in the 1970s. This nonlinearity of growth and massive changes in the epidemiology and treatment of disease render predictions about the need for or the numbers of physicians a decade hence unreliable.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Patients undergoing heart-valve replacement may receive a mechanical prosthesis, necessitating lifelong anticoagulant treatment, or a porcine bioprosthesis, which involves no absolute need for anticoagulants. METHODS. We carried out a randomized, prospective trial to compare the durability of the Bjork-Shiley mechanical prosthesis (spherical tilting-disk model) and the incidence of valve-related complications with those variables in the Hancock and the Carpentier-Edwards porcine prostheses. The mitral valve was replaced in 261 patients, the aortic valve in 211, and both in 61; the survivors have been followed up for a mean of 12 years. RESULTS. We found a trend toward improved actuarial survival after 12 years with the Bjork-Shiley prosthesis, but this trend was not statistically significant (group with Bjork-Shiley valve vs. group with porcine valve [mean +/- SE], 51.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 44.4 +/- 3.2 percent; P = 0.08). There was no significant difference in the actuarial incidence of reoperation after 5 years, but after 12 years significantly more patients with a porcine prosthesis had undergone reoperation (8.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 37.1 +/- 4.1 percent, P less than 0.001). An analysis combining death and reoperation as end points for an actuarial assessment of survival with the original prosthesis intact confirmed that the patients with Bjork-Shiley Shiley prostheses had improved survival (48.6 +/- 3.2 vs. 30.0 +/- 3.0 percent after 12 years, P less than 0.001). Bleeding requiring hospitalization or blood transfusion was significantly more frequent in the patients with Bjork-Shiley prostheses (18.6 +/- 3.2 vs. 7.1 +/- 2.3 percent after 12 years, P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference after 12 years in the actuarial occurrence of embolism (Bjork-Shiley vs. porcine, 21.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 26.4 +/- 3.5 percent) or endocarditis (3.7 +/- 1.4 vs 4.6 +/- 1.6 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Survival with an intact valve is better among patients with the Bjork-Shiley spherical tilting-disk prosthesis than among patients with porcine bioprostheses, but use of the Bjork-Shiley valve carries an attendant increased risk of bleeding associated with the need for anticoagulant treatment.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of relapse after primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis remains high. We conducted a controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with fluconazole. At entry into the study, all participants had sterile cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine after following a standardized course of therapy for culture-proved cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were randomly assigned to take either fluconazole or placebo as maintenance therapy. The dose of fluconazole was 100 mg daily in the first phase of study and 200 mg daily in the second phase. RESULTS. Of 84 patients initially enrolled, 16 (19 percent) were found to have silent, persistent infection on the basis of cultures that became positive after entry into the study; 7 other patients were lost to follow-up shortly after entry. Of the remaining 61 patients, 10 of 27 assigned to placebo (37 percent) and 1 of 34 assigned to fluconazole (3 percent) had a recurrence of cryptococcal infection at any site (difference in risk, 34 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 53). Of the 11 recurrent infections, 7 were detected in urine obtained after prostatic massage. There were four recurrent meningeal infections in the patients taking placebo, but none in those taking fluconazole (mean duration of follow-up, 164 days) (P = 0.03). In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of recurrence-free survival were fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02; relative hazard, 13.2), a lower serum cryptococcal-antigen titer (P = 0.05; relative hazard, 1.2), and more prolonged primary therapy with flucytosine (P = 0.09; relative hazard, 1.1). Survival and toxicity were similar in the two maintenance-treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with AIDS, silent persistent infection is common after clinically successful treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole is highly effective in preventing recurrent cryptococcal infection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Despite the growth in the number of Americans in nursing homes, there are only limited data on the total amount of time that people spend in such facilities. We estimate the amount of time the average person spends in nursing homes over his or her lifetime (lifetime nursing home use), using data from the National Mortality Followback Survey of the next of kin of a sample of persons 25 years of age or older who died in 1986. On the basis of these data, we estimated the likelihood that Americans will use nursing home care during the course of their lifetimes and the total duration of such care. Current data on life expectancy were then used to reweight the sample to project lifetime nursing home use for those who became 65 years old in 1990. RESULTS. Of those who died in 1986 at 25 years of age or older, 29 percent had at some time been residents in a nursing home, and almost half of those who entered a nursing home spent a cumulative total of at least one year there. The probability of nursing home use increased sharply with age at death: 17 percent for age 65 to 74, 36 percent for age 75 to 84, and 60 percent for age 85 to 94. For persons who turned 65 in 1990, we project that 43 percent will enter a nursing home at some time before they die. Of those who enter nursing homes, 55 percent will have total lifetime use of at least one year, and 21 percent will have total lifetime use of five years or more. We also project that more women than men will enter nursing homes (52 percent vs. 33 percent), and among them, more women than men will have total lifetime nursing home use of five years or more (25 percent vs. 13 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Our projections indicate that over a lifetime, the risk of entering a nursing home and spending a long time there is substantial. With the elderly population growing, this has important implications for both medical practice and the financing of long-term care.\r"

A novel computational approach for estimating D was proposed by Mayhew and Longuet-Higgins, who demonstrated that the horizontal gradient of vertical disparities uniquely specifies the viewing distance. We have now used random dot stereograms in a shape judgement task to show that changes in vertical disparities have no effect on perceived three-dimensional shape. Changes in ocular convergence do alter perceived shape, suggesting substantial changes in the subjects' scaling of horizontal disparities. We conclude that vertical disparities are not used to scale disparities for viewing distance, and that extraretinal signals must be considered when analysing human three-dimensional shape perception.\r"

  ".U": "91125456\r", 
  ".W": "When humans listen to pairs of thnes they hear additional tones, or distortion products, that are not present in the stimulus. Two-tone distortion products are also known as combination tones, because their pitches match combinations of the primary frequencies (f1 and f2, f2 greater than f1), such as f2-f1, (n + 1)f1-nf2 and (n + 1)f2-nf1 (n = 1, 2, 3...). Physiological correlates of the perceived distortion products exist in responses of auditory-nerve fibres and inner hair cells and in otoacoustic emissions (sounds generated by the cochlea, recordable at the ear canal). Because the middle ear responds linearly to sound and neural responses to distortion products can be abolished by damage to hair cells at cochlear sites preferentially tuned to the frequencies of the primary tones, it was hypothesized that distortion products are generated at these sites and propagate mechanically along the basilar membrane to the location tuned to the distortion-product frequency. But until now, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have failed. Here we report the use of a new laser-velocimetry technique to demonstrate two-tone distortion in basilar-membrane motion at low and moderate stimulus intensities.\r"

  ".W": "Intake of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) leads to symptoms of Parkinson's disease and produces degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in humans, giving rise to the hypothesis that this disorder may be caused by endogenous or environmental toxins. Excitation mediated by dicarboxylic amino acids such as L-glutamate or L-aspartate, has been claimed to be involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We therefore sought to determine whether antagonists active at the NMDA or quisqualate subtypes of L-glutamate receptors prevent toxicity of either MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion, the active metabolite of MPTP) or the selective dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-OHDA in the rat substantia nigra pars compacta. We report here that certain selective NMDA antagonists (AP7, CPP, MK-801), but not the preferential quisqualate antagonists CNQX and NBQX, provided short-term (up to 24 h) protection against MPP+ toxicity when coadministered into the substantia nigra. Systemic administration of CPP or MK-801 also offered temporary protection for up to 4 h against MPP+ toxicity. Repeated systemic administration of either compound prolonged protection against MPP+ challenge. Repeated administration for at least 24 h also led to permanent protection, still evident 7 days after intranigral administration of MPP+.\r"

  ".U": "91125458\r", 
  ".W": "The modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by various neurotransmitters has been demonstrated in many neurons. Because of the critical role of Ca2+ in transmitter release and, more generally, in transmembrane signalling, this modulation has important functional implications. Hippocampal neurons possess low-threshold (T-type) Ca2+ channels and both L- and N-type high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. N-type Ca2+ channels are blocked selectively by omega-conotoxin and adenosine. These substances both block excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, whereas dihydropyridines, which selectively block L-type channels, are ineffective. Excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus displays a number of plasticity phenomena that are initiated by Ca2+ entry through ionic channels operated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Here we report that NMDA receptor agonists selectively and effectively depress N-type Ca2+ channels which are involved in neurotransmitter release from presynaptic sites. The inhibitory effect is eliminated by the competitive NMDA antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, does not require Ca2+ entry into the cell, and is probably receptor-mediated. This phenomenon may provide a negative feedback between the liberation of excitatory transmitter and entry of Ca2+ into the cell, and could be important in presynaptic inhibition and in the regulation of synaptic plasticity.\r"

  ".W": "In vertebrate photoreceptors, light reduces cyclic GMP concentration and closes cGMP-activated channels to induce a hyperpolarizing response. As Ca2+ can permeate the channels and the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger continuously extrudes Ca2+, closure of the channel results in a reduction of the inter-rod Ca2+ concentration. This is believed to be one of the mechanisms of light-adaptation produced by activation of guanylate cyclase. Effects of Ca2+ on the cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) have been reported, but their physiological significance has remained unclear. We have perfused the inside-out preparation of a frog rod outer segment (I/O ROS, originally termed truncated ROS, and find that Ca2+ in a physiological range regulates the light-activation of PDE. Therefore, PDE regulation by Ca2+ must be involved in light-adaptation in rods. The effect is mediated by a newly found protein which binds to disk membranes at high Ca2+ concentrations and prolongs PDE activation.\r"

Although CRF concentrations in the human peripheral circulation are normally low, they increase throughout pregnancy and fall rapidly after parturition. Maternal plasma CRF probably originates from the placenta, which responds to the bioactive peptide and produces the peptide and its messenger RNA. Even though CRF concentrations in late gestational maternal plasma are similar to those in rat hypothalamic portal blood and to those that can stimulate release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in vitro, maternal plasma ACTH concentrations increase only slightly with advancing gestation and remain within the normal range. Several groups have now reported the existence of a CRF-binding protein in human plasma which inactivates CRF and which has been proposed to prevent inappropriate pituitary-adrenal stimulation in pregnancy. The binding protein was recently purified from human plasma. We have now isolated and partially sequenced the binding protein, allowing us to clone and characterize its complementary DNA from human liver and rat brain. Expression of the cDNAs for human and rat binding protein in COS7 cells showed that these proteins bind CRF with the same affinity as the native human protein. Both rat and human recombinant binding proteins inhibit CRF binding to a CRF antibody and inhibit CRF-induced ACTH release by pituitary cells in vitro.\r"

The kinase is ubiquitously expressed and can promote proliferation, presumably in a manner dependent on growth-factor receptors and membrane-associated oncogenes. We have now examined the dependence of serum- and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-regulated NIH/3T3 cell growth on RAF-1 kinase to determine whether Raf-1 is essential for receptor signalling. We inhibited Raf-1 function by expressing c-raf-1 antisense RNA or kinase-defective c-raf-1 mutants. Antisense RNA for c-raf-1 interferes with proliferation of normal NIH/3T3 cells and reverts raf-transformed cells. In revertant cells, DNA replication induced by serum or TPA was eliminated or reduced proportionately to the reduction in Raf protein levels. Expression of a kinase-defective Raf-1 mutant (craf301) or a regulatory domain fragment (HCR) inhibited serum-induced NIH/3T3-cell proliferation and raf transformation even more efficiently. Inhibition by antisense RNA or craf301 blocked proliferation and transformation by Ki- and Ha-ras oncogenes. We conclude that raf functions as an essential signal transducer downstream of serum growth factor receptors, protein kinase C and ras.\r"

Replicating cellular DNA redistributes to these compartments upon HSV-1 infection. We have now used antibodies raised against several cellular proteins to detect changes in their subnuclear localization on HSV-1 infection. We found that various proteins involved in cellular DNA replication move to sites of viral DNA synthesis, whereas a selection of non-replication proteins do not. The retinoblastoma protein and p53 (the products of two putative anti-oncogenes) relocate to the same sites as known DNA replication proteins, suggesting that they may be associated with DNA replication complexes in normal, uninfected cells.\r"

Here we report different results, using an approach in which the several products of a DNA polymerase reaction can be measured. In contrast to the earlier report, we find that dCMP and dAMP are incorporated selectively opposite 8-oxodG with transient inhibition of chain extension occurring 3' to the modified base. The potentially mutagenic insertion of dAMP is targeted exclusively to the site of the lesion. The ratio of dCMP to dAMP incorporated varies, depending on the DNA polymerase involved. Chain extension from the dA.8-oxodG pair was efficiently catalysed by all polymerases tested.\r"

The demonstration of RNA editing (the specific insertion, deletion or substitution of residues in RNA to create an RNA with a sequence different from its own template) raised the possibility that in some cases not all of the genetic information for a trait residues in the DNA template. Two different types of RNA editing have been identified in mitochondria: insertional editing represented by the extensive insertion (and occasional deletion) of uridine residues in mitochondrial RNAs of the kinetoplastid protozoa and the substitutional editing represented by the cytidine to uridine substitutions in some plant mitochondria. These editing types have not been shown to be present in the same organism and may have very different mechanisms. RNA editing of both types has been observed in nonmitochondrial systems but is not as extensive and may involve still different mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of extensive insertional RNA editing in mitochondria from an organism other than a kinetoplastid protozoan. The mitochondrial RNA apparently encoding the alpha subunit of ATP synthetase in the acellular slime mould, Physarum polycephalum, is edited at 54 sites by cytidine insertion.\r"

The type-I iodothyronine deiodinase, a thiol-requiring propylthiouracil-sensitive oxidoreductase, is found mainly in liver and kidney and provides most of the circulating T3(1) but so far this enzyme has not been purified. Using expression cloning in the Xenopus oocyte, we have isolated a 2.1-kilobase complementary DNA for this deiodinase from a rat liver cDNA library. The kinetic properties of the protein expressed in transient assay systems, the tissue distribution of the messenger RNA, and its changes with thyroid status, all confirm its identity. We find that the mRNA for this enzyme contains a UGA codon for selenocysteine which is necessary for maximal enzyme activity. This explains why conversion of T4 to T3 is impaired in experimental selenium deficiency and identifies an essential role for this trace element in thyroid hormone action.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most remarkable developments in quantum mechanics in recent years has been the discovery that when a system is moved adiabatically around a closed loop in parameter space there occurs, besides the familiar dynamical phase shift, an additional phase shift (sometimes referred to as 'Berry's phase') that is purely geometric in nature. The dynamical phase shift, which results from the variation of the period of the oscillatory system with the change in parameters, is relatively easily understood and is proportional to the time over which the parameter change occurs. The geometric phase shift, on the other hand, is less intuitive and depends on the curvature of the surface in parameter space bounded by the closed path, but is independent of the time taken to traverse the circuit. Here we present evidence for time-independent geometric phase shifts in numerical solutions for a model of an oscillating chemical reaction. The conditions for the occurrence of such shifts seem to be sufficiently general that geometric phase effects should be experimentally observable in essentially all chemical oscillators as well as in biological networks such as the brain and the central nervous system, where phase control is of vital importance.\r"

  ".U": "91125478\r", 
  ".W": "The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) contains an abundance of the transition metal zinc, which is highly localized in the neuronal parenchyma. Zinc is actively taken up and stored in synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals, and stimulation of nerve fibre tracts that contain large amounts of zinc, such as the hippocampal mossy fibre system, can induce its release, suggesting that it may act as a neuromodulator. The known interaction of zinc with the major excitatory and inhibitory amino-acid neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS supports this notion. That zinc has a role in CNS synaptic transmission, however, has so far not been shown. Here we report a physiological role for zinc in the young rat hippocampus (postnatal, P3-P14 days). Our results indicate that naturally occurring spontaneous giant depolarizing synaptic potentials (GDPs) in young CA3 pyramidal neurones, mediated by the release of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), are induced by endogenously released zinc. These synaptic potentials are inhibited by specific zinc-chelating agents. GDPs are apparently generated by an inhibitory action of zinc on both pre- and postsynaptic GABAB receptors in the hippocampus. Our study implies that zinc modulates synaptic transmission in the immature hippocampus, a finding that may have implications for understanding benign postnatal seizures in young children suffering with acute zinc deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Many animals with overall bilateral symmetry also exhibit some left-right asymmetries with generally invariant handedness. Therefore, the left-right embryonic axis must have a consistent polarity, whose origins and subsequent effects on development are not understood. Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits such left-right asymmetries at all developmental stages. The embryonic cell lineage is asymmetric as well: although the animal is generally bilaterally symmetric, many of its contralaterally analogous cells arise from different lineages on the two sides of the embryo. I accomplished reversal of embryonic handedness by micromanipulation at the 6-cell stage, which resulted in mirror-image but otherwise normal development into healthy, fertile animals with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed. This result demonstrates that in the 6-cell embryo the pair of anterior (AB) blastomeres on the right is equivalent to the pair on the left, and that the extensive differences in fates between lineally homologous derivatives of these cells on the two sides of the animal must be dictated by cell interactions, most of which are likely to occur early in embryogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Replication and repair are essential processes that maintain the continuity of the genetic material. Dissection of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication has resulted in the identification of many eukaryotic replication proteins, but the biochemistry of the multienzyme process of DNA excision repair is less well defined. One protein that is absolutely required for semiconservative replication of SV40 DNA in vitro is human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB, also called RF-A and RP-A). SSB consists of three polypeptides of relative molecular mass 70,000, 34,000 and 13,000, and acts with T antigen and topoisomerases to unwind DNA, allowing the access of other replication proteins. Human SSB can also stimulate the activity of polymerases alpha and delta, suggesting a further role in elongation during DNA replication. We have now found a role for human SSB in DNA excision repair using a cell-free system that can carry out nucleotide excision repair in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies against human SSB caused extensive inhibition of DNA repair in plasmid molecules damaged by ultraviolet light or acetylaminofluorene. Addition of purified SSB reversed this inhibition and further stimulated repair synthesis by increasing the number of repair events. These results show that a mammalian DNA replication protein is also essential for repair.\r"

  ".U": "91125486\r", 
  ".W": "Ferritin is important in iron homeostasis. Its twenty-four chains of two types, H and L, assemble as a hollow shell providing an iron-storage cavity. Ferritin molecules in cells containing high levels of iron tend to be rich in L chains, and may have a long-term storage function, whereas H-rich ferritins are more active in iron metabolism. The molecular basis for the greater activity of H-rich ferritins has until now been obscure, largely because the structure of H-chain ferritin has remained unknown owing to the difficulties in obtaining crystals ordered enough for X-ray crystallographic analysis. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a human ferritin H-chain homopolymer. By genetically engineering a change in the sequence of the intermolecular contact region, we obtained crystals isomorphous with the homologous rat L ferritin and of high enough quality for X-ray diffraction analysis. The X-ray structure of human H ferritin shows a novel metal site embedded within each of its four-helix bundles and we suggest that ferroxidase activity associated with this site accounts for its rapid uptake of iron.\r"

The special problems and concerns of the patient with YOPD present as much of a challenge and opportunity for the clinician as the disease itself does for the researcher. In contrast to juvenile parkinsonism, which is a heterogeneous group of clinicopathologic entities presenting (also arbitrarily) before age 21, YOPD appears to be the same nosologic entity as older-onset PD. It comprises approximately 5% of referral populations in Western countries and about 10% in Japan. Its annual incidence relative to the population at risk is about 1/10 that of PD at age sixty. YOPD tends to have more gradual progression of parkinsonian signs and symptoms, earlier appearance of levodopa-related dyskinesias and levodopa-dose-related motor fluctuations, and frequent presence of dystonia as an early or presenting sign. Studies conflict with regard to the suspected greater familial frequency and lesser frequency of dementia than in older-onset PD.\r"

Investigation of blood donors identified a 25-year-old white Hispanic woman from Florida whose platelets had been given to the patient and who was seropositive for the virus on a serum specimen obtained 2 years after the donation. She was born in Cuba and had had 2 sexual relationships with men who either had been born in or had resided in the Caribbean. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that both donor and recipient were infected with HTLV-I. Molecular studies of a 595-nucleotide sequence in the 5' envelope region of HTLV-I indicated that the viruses from donor and recipient were identical in each of 32 positions in which published HTLV-I sequences demonstrate molecular heterogeneity; the donor and recipient viruses were also identical in 2 additional positions in which they differed from all published sequences. Transfusion-associated HAM/TSP has occurred in the United States, but additional cases should be prevented by screening blood donations for HTLV-I. Molecular studies of HTLV-I may prove useful in defining the genetic heterogeneity of HTLV-I isolates in the United States and in studying transmission of this virus.\r"

Western blot and polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of HTLV-I in 2 subjects and HTLV-II infection in 2 others. Both HIV-1/HTLV-I coinfected subjects and 1 HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfected subject had a slowly progressive myelopathy clinically identical tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). The presence of a myelopathy resembling TSP/HAM in the coinfected subjects suggests that HIV-1 may enhance the expression of neurologic disease caused by HTLV. Patients with a progressive myelopathy occurring in association with HIV-1 infection should be serologically tested for the presence of HTLV. Establishing dual infection has therapeutic and prognostic import as 1 of the HIV-1/HTLV-I subjects substantially improved with corticosteroids and the HIV-1/HTLV-II subject with myelopathy had a marked improvement in the absence of therapeutic intervention.\r"

In separate choice reaction time tasks, the subjects pressed buttons to randomly presented auditory or visual stimuli at probabilities of either 20/80 or 50/50. There were no group differences on any of the neuropsychological tests commonly used in screening batteries for HIV patients. In contrast, reduced P300 amplitudes and increased P300 latencies occurred in ARC/AIDS patients in response to both auditory and visual stimuli, while in AS+ patients such alterations occurred only in the visual modality. Significant delays in P2 latency were found only in the auditory modality and then only in ARC/AIDS patients. ARC/AIDS patients alone showed delayed response times, and only in the auditory modality.

Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced.

A \"voluntary\" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect.

The age at onset of tremor showed bimodal distribution for both male and female patients, with peaks in 2nd and 6th decades. ET appeared most frequently in hands, followed by head, voice, tongue, leg, and trunk. Half of the patients (47%) had associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. At least one 1st-degree relative of 62.5% of ET patients reported tremor. Alcohol relieved tremor in 2/3 of ET patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients who had adequate follow-up improved with propranolol, and 72% with primidone. There was no significant difference in various clinical variables between the 219 patients with familial ET and 131 with sporadic ET. Patients with early-onset ET were more likely to have hand involvement and associated dystonia than patients with late-onset ET. Dystonia was more frequently associated with mild ET than with severe ET. Patients with low-frequency tremor were older and had more head but less hand involvement than patients with high-frequency tremor. The lack of relevant differences between ET subgroups suggests that, despite variable expression, ET represents a single disease entity.\r"

Ninety percent of the IIH patients were women; the mean age was 33. Obesity and recent weight gain were much more common among patients than controls. Symptoms most commonly reported by IIH patients were headache (94%), transient visual obscurations (TVO) (68%), and intracranial noises (ICN) (58%). Daily occurrence of these symptoms was much more common among patients than controls. Controls also reported these and other IIH symptoms, but at lower frequencies. Several conditions previously associated with IIH were no more common in patients than controls including iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, pregnancy, antibiotic intake, and use of oral contraceptives. We conclude that previous studies of IIH, mostly uncontrolled and retrospective, have underestimated the frequency of symptoms in IIH patients and reported chance and spurious associations with common medical conditions and medications. The profile of a young obese woman with headaches and either TVO or ICN should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of IIH, especially when the symptoms occur daily.\r"

During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up.\r"

There were no edematous cerebellar infarcts with signs of brainstem compression, and all patients spontaneously improved without significant sequellae. Angiography in 2 patients and pathologic examination of arteries in 1 patient disclosed no occlusion in the vertebrobasilar system. Six patients had a cardiac source of emboli. In conclusion, infarcts of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum can be regarded as a benign condition in which there is, frequently, a cardiac source of emboli.\r"

We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.\r"

Eight additional subjects and 6 control subjects had nonspecific high-signal white matter changes on MRI. MRI confirmed the diagnosis of TS in only 1 parent without physical findings of the disease, similar to the results of earlier studies using computed cranial tomography. CT may be less sensitive than MRI but is probably more specific for TS. Either CT or MRI may occasionally help substantiate the diagnosis of TS in a parent with few other findings. Both studies may need to be done in some parents to maximize the accuracy of genetic counseling.\r"

  ".U": "91125599\r", 
  ".W": "The epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) is a sporadic neurocutaneous disorder that consists of epidermal nevi and congenital anomalies involving the brain and other systems. From among over 60 patients with ENS presenting with neurologic manifestations, we identified 17 who had hemimegalencephaly based on pathologic or radiologic studies. Associated brain and neurologic abnormalities included gyral malformations in 12 of 12, mental retardation in 13 of 14, seizures in 16 of 17 (including 9 with infantile spasms), and contralateral hemiparesis in 7 of 12. All had ipsilateral epidermal nevi of the head, and several had ipsilateral facial hemihypertrophy. We concluded that these abnormalities comprise a recognizable neurologic variant of ENS that we believe represents the full expression of primary brain involvement. Several patients also had evidence of acquired brain lesions such as infarcts, atrophy, porencephaly, and calcifications, which are best explained by prior ischemia or hemorrhage. Given repeated observations of blood vessel anomalies in ENS patients, we hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia predisposes to these acquired lesions. The same cause may be invoked to explain the wide variety of neurologic symptoms reported in ENS patients without hemimegalencephaly. While the cause of ENS remains unknown, several observations suggest a somatic mutation.\r"

Sixteen were primary tumors (12 anaplastic glioma, 2 craniopharyngioma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 1 brainstem glioma) and 4 were metastatic. Fourteen had the CT appearance of a true cyst and 7 a pseudocyst. We placed 18 catheters through twist drill holes via CT stereotactic guidance and 3 through burr holes via CT guidance and effectively aspirated 3 to 50 ml cyst fluid from 1 to 18 times in each patient. Postaspiration CT showed complete or significant reduction in cyst size in all patients in whom it was performed (18 after initial aspiration and 9 after subsequent aspirations). Asymptomatic intracyst hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients after cyst wall biopsy and catheter placement. There have been no other complications at follow-up of 4 to 114 weeks. In our experience, tumor cyst aspiration by the Ommaya reservoir system is as effective as percutaneous needle aspiration, but after catheter placement aspiration can be performed with minimal technical skill, avoiding repeated CT guidance required for needle aspiration of recurrent deep-seated cysts.\r"

The 3 normal inhibitory phases of reciprocal inhibition between extensor and flexor forearm muscles were markedly reduced on the spastic side of patients.

Comparison of interictal EEG foci with final localization was made. In 39 patients, slow-wave sleep activated spiking compared with wakefulness. Most patients showed maximal spiking in sleep stages 3 or 4. Restriction of field in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness, and extension of field in slow-wave sleep occurred. New foci appeared in non-rapid eye movement sleep in 53% of patients. Similar but not identical spiking rates, foci, and field distributions were seen in wakefulness and REM sleep. All REM foci were unilateral. Our findings suggest that localization of the primary epileptogenic area is more reliable in REM sleep than in wakefulness, and in wakefulness more than in slow-wave sleep.\r"

Corticosteroids are frequently and effectively used to ameliorate MS exacerbations, despite inadequate knowledge about the mechanism. We assessed the effects of a 21-aminosteroid, U74500A, a new class of steroid derivatives without glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid effects, on the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chemiluminescence by stimulated monocytes harvested from 8 stable MS patients and age- and sex-matched controls. H2O2 measurements and chemiluminescence were significantly reduced in both groups by U74500A. These results demonstrate that 21-aminosteroids reduce production of toxic oxygen metabolites by monocytes and thus their inflammatory potential, suggesting that these agents may be potentially effective and safe treatment for MS exacerbations.\r"

Maternal side effects were minor in both groups. Acute fetal distress developed in one nifedipine subject and in 11 treated with hydralazine. Mean prolongation of gestation was 15.5 +/- 10 days with nifedipine and 9.5 +/- 11 days with hydralazine, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P less than .07). Infants born to women treated with nifedipine were delivered at more advanced gestational ages (34.6 +/- 2.3 versus 33.6 +/- 2.4 weeks; statistically not significant), weighed more (1826 +/- 456 versus 1580 +/- 499 g; statistically not significant), and tended to have fewer, mainly minor, complications. The average number of days spent in the neonatal intensive care unit was significantly lower in the nifedipine group (15.1 versus 32.7 days; P less than .005), leading to an average 31% reduction in total (maternal and neonatal) hospitalization-related charges for each nifedipine-treated pregnancy. We conclude that nifedipine is an effective, convenient, and low-cost treatment for patients with severe preeclampsia, and is not associated with undesirable side effects.\r"

Urinary catecholamines were increased by 58% (P less than .03) during work periods compared with non-work periods. Catecholamine levels were also increased by 64% (P less than .025) over those of a working non-physician control group of similar gestational age. Urinary catecholamine levels are a direct reflection of plasma catecholamine levels. Catecholamine levels are known to increase with physical stress, such as standing, and with mental stress, such as difficult problem-solving. Catecholamines are also known to decrease uterine blood flow. Measurement of catecholamines may be a helpful marker in investigating the relationship between occupation and pregnancy outcome.\r"

We studied 13,119 singleton births in a predominantly black, indigent population occurring between November 1982 and April 1986 to identify the proportion of preterm births that may have been prevented using current treatment modalities. Forty-four percent of the preterm births occurred at 35 to 36 weeks' gestational age, a time when most practitioners do not attempt tocolysis. Of the remainder, 17% occurred before 35 weeks but were indicated for maternal medical or obstetric complications, and another 17% occurred before 35 weeks but followed spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes. Therefore, of the 1445 preterm births, we calculated that only 336 (23.2%) were theoretically preventable. A fourth of these presented at less than 3 cm cervical dilatation and were treated appropriately with tocolytics, but delivered anyway. Therefore, most of the potentially preventable births occurred in the group that presented with cervical dilatation of more than 3 cm. We conclude that improving the preterm birth rate significantly below current levels may be difficult to achieve.\r"

After establishment of epidural analgesia, 88 parturients with vertex presentation were assigned randomly to receive either patient-controlled epidural analgesia or continuous epidural infusion, using 0.125% bupivacaine containing 1 microgram/mL of fentanyl. Inadequate analgesia was treated in both groups with a 10-mL \"top-up\" of 0.25% bupivacaine. Patients receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia required significantly fewer supplemental top-up doses (36 versus 71%; P less than .05) and insignificantly less local anesthetic (13.6 +/- 0.6 versus 14.6 +/- 0.5 mL/hour; P = .10). The two groups did not differ in incidence of hypotension, high sensory blockade (above T8), mode of delivery, or patient satisfaction assessed by questionnaire. Use of local anesthetic solution was examined with respect to cervical dilatation and did not increase late in labor. Patients generally viewed infusion technology favorably. These findings suggest that patient-controlled epidural analgesia is safe and effective, reduces anesthesia manpower needs, and is well accepted.\r"

Specifically, we present and interpret data from a series of experiments using force-sensing devices on 29 randomly selected vaginal births, including two shoulder dystocia deliveries and one birth injury. The results indicate that clinician-applied peak forces are typically about 47 N for routine deliveries, 69 N for difficult deliveries, and 100 N for a shoulder dystocia delivery (P less than .01). The time required to deliver fetal shoulders doubles for nonroutine deliveries (P less than .01). In addition, impulse and rate of application of force distinguish between routine and nonroutine deliveries (P less than .03). We conclude that, if properly perceived, force, force rate, and the duration of force are objective parameters that can be used in recognizing and managing shoulder dystocia and in predicting thresholds for birth injury.\r"

We now report the results of a prospective study of 357 forceps deliveries classified using each system. Allowing up to 45 degrees of rotation in an outlet forceps delivery did not increase morbidity measured by any criterion. Dividing the old midforceps group by precisely identifying station and rotation permitted greater stratification of the risks of short-term neonatal and maternal morbidity. We conclude that our results validate the 1988 classification scheme.\r"

There were statistically significant differences in head size between the unexposed and cocaine-exposed infants (P less than .001). Notably, head circumference was reduced proportionately more than birth weight in cocaine-exposed infants, a pattern similar to that observed in alcohol-exposed infants. Alcohol- and cocaine-exposed infants were not statistically different in head circumference. We conclude that brain growth of cocaine-exposed infants is similar to that reported for alcohol-exposed infants, and that cocaine-exposed infants may be characterized as having asymmetrical growth retardation.\r"

The fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine and umbilical artery waveforms were measured before exercise, immediately after exercise, and at 5-minute intervals during 20 minutes of recovery. The mean maternal maximal heart rate was 179 +/- 12 beats per minute and did not differ between swimming and cycling exercise trials. Six episodes of transient bradycardia occurred after a total of 45 maximal exercise trials. The mean FHR decreased slightly immediately after exercise, then increased approximately ten beats above baseline levels at 10-20 minutes after exercise (P less than .02). The changes from baseline in FHR were greater after cycling than after swimming. Changes observed in the systolic-diastolic ratio (S/D) of the umbilical artery could be accounted for by the FHR variations. The S/D of the uterine artery was significantly higher after cycling than after swimming (P = .05). We conclude that maximal maternal exercise during pregnancy causes transient fetal bradycardia in approximately 15% of cases, in cycling more often than in swimming.\r"

The three major etiologies for the multiple gestations were fertility drugs (50%), spontaneous (38%), and in vitro methods (9%). The average length of gestation was 33.8 weeks and the mean birth weight was 1911 g. Neonatal birth weight curves for triplet infants born alive in the third trimester were plotted. From 26-35 weeks, the average triplet newborn has a weight corresponding to approximately the 30th percentile level compared with singletons. After 35 weeks, triplet birth weights fall progressively behind those of singletons, reaching the tenth percentile at 38 weeks. Multiple epidemiologic factors were analyzed to determine their effect upon neonatal birth weight and length of gestation. Factors predicting higher than average birth weight included male sex, increasing maternal age, increasing maternal height and weight, maternal weight gain, and maternal parity. The length of gestation was found to correlate with maternal age, weight gain, and parity. No significant association between fertility method and gestational age or weight could be identified. This large data base provides the first comprehensive percentile birth weight rankings for modernly managed triplet gestations in the United States population. A regression equation is presented which accurately predicts mean triplet birth weight in the third trimester and which suggests that a nearly linear weight gain of approximately 150 g per week per fetus should be expected in this period.\r"

Both flexible and rigid salpingoscopes were used, and observations were documented by intratubal photography. Salpingoscopic criteria were established and each criterion assigned a numerical value. Each tube was evaluated for patency, mucosal fold architecture, erythema, adhesions, and dilatation. Based on these criteria, tubes were graded as normal or as abnormal with mild, moderate, or severe changes. Histologically, each tube was evaluated for patency, epithelial changes, vascularity, dilatation, adhesions, and active inflammation. Six tubes with significant histologic findings and two histologically normal fallopian tubes were also examined by transmission electron microscopy. In five discordant cases, histology revealed epithelial and stromal changes not detected by salpingoscopy. Fallopian tubes with severe disease were diagnosed by both methods. Transmission electron microscopy of histologically abnormal tubes showed flattening of the epithelium with markedly reduced ciliary distribution, degenerating secretory epithelial cells with large intracellular vacuoles, and swollen nuclei containing sparse chromatin. Our results indicate that salpingoscopic observations are consistent with histologic findings when endotubal disease is severe. However, moderate pathologic changes as documented by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were frequently not diagnosed salpingoscopically, even with magnification.\r"

We performed this study to determine the time frame for resolution of the sonographically identifiable mass during such therapy and to determine the role of sonography in the management of these patients. Eighteen patients treated with methotrexate for laparoscopically proven ectopic pregnancy consented to long-term follow-up with endovaginal sonography. These 18 patients constitute the study group. The time required for sonographic resolution of the mass was variable, although poor patient compliance with sonographic follow-up affected the conclusions regarding resolution time. One hundred eight days was the longest period accurately known for resolution of a mass. In seven patients, the mass persisted after a negative hCG titer. Enlargement of the adnexal mass during therapy did not necessarily predict treatment failure, as only two of ten such patients required surgery for rupture. Serial sonography did not alter the management of most patients and appears not to be warranted on a routine basis. Follow-up sonography was most useful when complications were suspected. All patients considered for methotrexate therapy should first have an endovaginal sonogram, as cardiac activity remains a relative contraindication to this treatment. We have determined that the mass of an ectopic pregnancy may remain after the hCG is negative. Therefore, a persistent mass should not be interpreted as treatment failure.\r"

Because an interaction between doxycycline and OCs, especially those containing low-dose estrogen, could result in an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, a controlled clinical trial of the effects of doxycycline on OC hormone concentrations was performed. Twenty-four women aged 18-35 years were recruited as volunteers from among the patients seen in a University-based family planning clinic. While they were on a steady dose of the OC Ortho-Novum 1/35, serum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, and endogenous progesterone were measured on days 18, 19, and 20 of the menstrual cycle (control phase). These measurements were repeated on days 18, 19, and 20 of the following menstrual cycle while the patient was taking doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily (treatment phase). No statistically significant differences in serum levels of ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, or endogenous progesterone were seen between the control and treatment phases. However, there was large inter-patient and intra-patient variability in ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone levels. No elevations of endogenous progesterone occurred to suggest ovulation during antibiotic administration in either phase. It is not known what effects longer or earlier administration of doxycycline during the OC cycle would have on serum hormone concentrations or ovulation. Pregnancies attributed to failure of OCs because of tetracycline use could in fact be due to other causes or could represent a true interaction that only manifests itself in a small proportion of women at risk.\r"

Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies. The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%. A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months. Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis.\r"

  ".W": "A women's sexual behavior affects her risk of acquiring pelvic inflammatory disease, but the risks have not been well characterized. To study the association between pelvic inflammatory disease and sexual behavior, we analyzed data from a multicenter, case-control study involving 712 women hospitalized with an initial episode of pelvic inflammatory disease and 2719 hospitalized control women without a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Study participants provided information on their frequency of intercourse, number of recent sexual partners, and previous history of gonorrhea. Logistic regression methods were used to adjust for confounding factors. Women who reported having four or more sexual partners were over three times more likely to be hospitalized for pelvic inflammatory disease (relative risk 3.4; 95% confidence interval 2.2-5.3) than were women who reported only one recent sexual partner. To a lesser extent, frequent sexual intercourse and history of gonorrhea also increased a woman's risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Frequent intercourse was a strong risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease among a subgroup of women who were at low risk for acquiring a sexually transmitted disease: Married women with one recent sexual partner with intercourse six or more times per week had a risk of pelvic inflammatory disease of 3.2 (1.4-7.2) compared with similar women having intercourse less than once per week. Frequent intercourse, which does not by itself increase the risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease, may increase a woman's risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized manner, 108 patients at 15-25 weeks' gestation were assigned to treatment with oral amoxicillin, 500 mg three times daily for 14 days, or placebo. Patients were evaluated 2 weeks after treatment, at 34-36 weeks' gestation, and at delivery. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to any clinical or microbiologic measure of treatment outcome. There were also no significant differences in the frequency of obstetric complications. We conclude that amoxicillin is not effective therapy for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.\r"

Among various risk factors analyzed, the absence of ventricular dilatation correlated most strongly with a chromosome abnormality. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 17 of 22 fetuses (77%) lacking ventricular dilatation, compared with only one of 11 fetuses (9%) with ventricular dilatation (P less than .001). Other factors statistically associated (P less than .01) with an underlying chromosome abnormality included mild enlargement of the cisterna magna (10-14 mm), concurrent anomalies detected sonographically, and fetal growth retardation. However, stepwise logistic regression showed that only the absence of ventricular dilatation and the presence of concurrent anomalies were significant when multiple factors were evaluated. These observations support the utility of evaluating the cisterna magna as part of a routine anatomical survey.\r"

Severe cataract was correctly diagnosed by transvaginal sonography. However, transvaginal sonography failed to detect moderate cataract in a case of repeat cataract in a subsequent gestation. Anophthalmia may sometimes be secondary to a degenerative process in middle and late pregnancy.

Studies were done to assess the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a simple cystometer. Standing incremental, retrograde cystometry was found to be relatively inexpensive, simple, reproducible, and sensitive. The two cystometrograms yielded similar results in 84% of the patients. The sensitivities were found to be 84.3 and 90.2% for the first and second cystometrograms, respectively. Using both cystometrograms together, we were able to detect detrusor instability with a sensitivity of 92.3% and to predict its absence with a negative predictive value of 86.7%. Detrusor instability was found in 64% of these patients. Based on these results, it was concluded that when multichannel urodynamics are not available in a high-prevalence population, standing retrograde incremental water cystometry done on two occasions may offer the physician an accurate alternative for the diagnosis of detrusor instability.\r"

Extended surgical staging, including pelvic and periaortic node dissection, is indicated in patients with deep myometrial invasion or high-grade tumor, or when other risk factors for extrauterine spread are present. In this study, cervical cytology was reviewed in 86 patients with endometrial carcinoma, all of whom underwent surgical staging, to correlate the cytologic results with surgical and pathologic findings. Cervical cytology was normal in 20 patients (23%), whereas suspicious or malignant endometrial cells were present in 23 and 43 cases (27 and 50%), respectively. Suspicious or malignant cervical cytology was associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P = .011), higher postoperative tumor grade (P = .006), positive peritoneal washings (P = .012), and more advanced stage by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria (P = .024). When compared with patients with normal cervical cytology, those who had malignant endometrial cells had over twice the risk of deep myometrial invasion (67 versus 30%), twice the risk of grade 2 or 3 tumor (60 versus 30%), and three times the risk of positive peritoneal washings (33 versus 10%). Seventy-four percent of patients with malignant cervical cytology were stage IC or more. In contrast, 70% of patients with normal cervical cytology were stage IA or IB. Patients with endometrial carcinoma who have malignant endometrial cells detected by cervical cytology are at increased risk of having a deeply invasive, high-grade, advanced-stage tumor, and therefore are more likely to require extended surgical staging.\r"

We conducted a meta-analysis that included 31 studies with a total of 11,417 trials of labor to evaluate the association between birth route after a cesarean and morbidity and mortality for the mother and infant. Summary odds ratios were calculated. Maternal febrile morbidity was significantly lower after a trial of labor than after an elective repeat cesarean. The intended birth route made no difference in the rates of uterine dehiscence or rupture. The use of oxytocin, presence of a recurrent indication for the previous cesarean, and presence of an unknown uterine scar were also unassociated with dehiscence or rupture. After excluding antepartum deaths, fetuses weighing less than 750 g, and congenital anomalies incompatible with life, we found no difference in perinatal death rates. The proportion of 5-minute Apgar scores of 6 or lower was higher after a trial of labor, but we were unable to exclude very low birth weight fetuses or those with congenital anomalies from this analysis. Our findings argue for trials of labor for more women after a cesarean birth.\r"

Under select circumstances, such as hydramnios, oligohydramnios/anhydramnios, a back-up fetus/posterior placenta, or gestation of fewer than 20 weeks, funipuncture can be difficult or impossible. We have developed a new instrument, the \"Cordostat,\" which can help the operator perform difficult funipuncture by providing stabilization and allowing intrauterine manipulation of the umbilical cord. The instrument consists of a deflecting wire guide threaded through a 19.5-guage trochar needle, which can be manually controlled to coil around and stabilize a free loop of cord. Conventional funipuncture can then be performed through a second uterine puncture. We describe use of this instrument in 12 patients undergoing second-trimester induced abortion.\r"

The systolic-diastolic ratio (S/D) and pulsatility index of the intraplacental fetal artery downstream to the umbilical artery decreased significantly with advancing gestational age, and its S/Ds were persistently lower than those of the umbilical artery. The difference in the S/D between the umbilical artery and its intraplacental downstream branches decreased with advancing gestational age and approached zero as the pregnancy progressed to term. We conclude that intraplacental fetal arteries, possibly fetal arteries in main stem villi, can be imaged by color flow mapping and that there is a significant \"resistance gradient\" between the intraplacental fetal artery and the umbilical artery. Intraplacental fetal artery velocimetry using color flow mapping may give further insights into the umbilical-placental circulation.\r"

No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The average hospital stay was 1.1 days, and patients were released 3-14 days postoperatively. Five of the six patients with chronic pelvic pain had prompt resolution of their symptoms. In one patient who had a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a contralateral procedure was required 3 months later because of continued chronic pelvic pain; her pain subsequently resolved. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy has the potential to decrease morbidity as compared with laparotomy in appropriately selected cases.\r"

An elliptical piece of full-thickness skin harvested from the area overlying the iliac crest is cleared of underlying fat, trimmed to fit the recipient site, and sutured in place. Vaginal packing is used to keep the graft against the recipient bed. Ten patients have been treated successfully with this technique, without significant complications or sequelae. Follow-up from 6 weeks to 42 months showed excellent postsurgical vaginal capacity in all patients. Similarly, excellent functional results were achieved in eight patients, with distinct improvement in the remaining two.

In addition, careful skeletal and muscular reconstruction of the surgical defect is necessary for a successful outcome. A new, universal, classification schemata (types I-VI) of shoulder girdle resections has been developed. This classification system is based on the bones resected, the status of the abductor mechanism, and the relationship to the glenohumeral joint. This system permits easy description and comparison of the various limb-sparing procedures performed.\r"

Stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with an expression vector containing the full-length human testis ACE cDNA results in the expression of two forms of recombinant human testis ACE (hTACE): membrane-bound ACE and, surprisingly, large quantities (up to 3 mg/liter) of soluble hTACE in the conditioned medium. Both forms are fully active and are physicochemically similar. However, by phase separation in Triton X-114, the soluble enzyme is hydrophilic, as is an anchor-minus mutant hTACE recovered from the medium of CHO cells transfected with a vector that contains a 3'-truncated testis ACE cDNA lacking the sequence encoding the membrane anchor. In contrast, the membrane-bound hTACE is amphipathic but is converted to a hydrophilic form on treatment with trypsin. The data establish that in ACE the hydrophobic sequence near the C terminus is necessary for membrane anchoring. Moreover, in CHO cells, membrane-bound hTACE is apparently solubilized by proteolytic cleavage of this anchor. A similar mechanism may account for the release of endothelial ACE in vivo to generate serum ACE and more generally for the constitutive processing and solubilization of analogously anchored proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein, among others. The release of membrane-bound ACE in CHO cells may, therefore, provide a useful system for the study of membrane-protein-solubilizing proteases.\r"

In the presence of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, a CD change of -0.27 +/- 0.06 millidegree at 248 nm and a UV change of -2.7 +/- 0.3 milliabsorbance units at 275 nm occur upon incorporation of 120 pmol of dTMP in a reaction volume of 120 microliters (1 microM dTMP incorporation) into a synthetic template-primer, p(dA)40-60.p(dT)20. The transcription of poly(A).p(dT)12-18 by reverse transcriptases can also be monitored using these methods. Kinetic parameters for the polymerization reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment were determined from initial velocity measurements using CD or UV assays and were in close agreement with those measured by the standard single point radiochemical filtration assay. The generality of optical techniques for the measurement of DNA polymerase activity was shown by the use of a partially self-complementary hairpin-shaped oligonucleotide substrate for the Klenow fragment. Addition of a single nucleotide residue under steady-state conditions to this 35-mer at a concentration of 1.5-3 microM gave an easily measurable absorbance decrease at 275 nm, and the absorbance changes upon sequential addition of nucleotide units were additive.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that both clones code for a protein of 458 amino acids, which is 87% homologous to the human kidney glycosylated adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-C4) and divergent from the rat kidney nonglycosylated alpha 2B subtype (RNG alpha 2). Transient expression of RB alpha 2B in COS-7 cells resulted in high-affinity saturable binding (Kd = 0.25 nM) for [3H]rauwolscine and a high receptor number (Bmax = 7.7 pmol/mg of protein) in the membranes of transfected COS-7 cells. Pharmacological analysis demonstrated that the expressed receptor bound adrenergic ligands with the following order of potency: rauwolscine greater than yohimbine greater than prazosin greater than oxymetazoline, with a prazosin-to-oxymetazoline Ki ratio of 0.34. This profile is characteristic of the alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor subtype. Blotting analysis of rat brain mRNA gave one major (3.0-kilobase) and two minor (4.6- and 2.3-kilobase) mRNA species, and hybridization with strand-specific probes showed that both DNA strands of GR alpha 2B may be transcriptionally active. These findings show that rat brain expresses an alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor subtype that is structurally different from the rat kidney nonglycosylated alpha 2B subtype. Thus the rat expresses at least two divergent alpha 2B-adrenergic receptors.\r"

This extract, which can be easily prepared in 2.5 hr, is capable of accurate and efficient RNA polymerase II transcription of a variety of diverse genes from both Drosophila and mammals. With the relatively strong promoter of the Drosophila Kruppel gene, it is possible to achieve 20% template usage in a single round of transcription, which is considerably higher than the template usage of approximately 3% seen with standard nuclear extracts. Further, although U small nuclear RNA genes are refractory to transcription with HeLa transcription extracts, the soluble nuclear fraction transcribes a U1 small nuclear RNA gene from Drosophila. Moreover, transcriptional activation by sequence-specific activators can be attained in vitro with the soluble nuclear fraction. The overall transcriptional efficiency appears limited to 0.45 transcript per template of DNA per 30 min, but the mechanism of limitation is not known. The soluble nuclear fraction, which was developed to recreate the environment within the nucleus, should be useful when high efficiencies of RNA polymerase II transcription are desired.\r"

  ".W": "We have used liver fatty acid-binding protein/human growth hormone (L-FABP/hGH) fusion genes to explore the temporal and spatial differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells in 1- to 12-month-old transgenic mice. The intact, endogenous L-FABP gene (Fabpl) was not expressed in the colon at any time. Young adult transgenic mice containing nucleotides -596 to +21 of the rat L-FABP gene linked to the hGH gene (minus its 5' nontranscribed domain) demonstrated inappropriate expression of hGH in enterocytes and many enteroendocrine cells of most proximal and mid-colonic crypts (glands). Rare patches of hGH-negative crypts were present. With increasing age, a wave of \"extinction\" of L-FABP (-596 to +21)/hGH expression occurred, first in the distal colon and then in successively more proximal regions, leaving by 10 months of age only rare hGH-positive multicrypt patches. At no time during this progressive silencing of transgene expression were crypts observed that contained a mixture of hGH-positive and -negative cells at a particular cell stratum. Young (5-7 weeks) mice containing a L-FABP (-4000 to +21)/hGH transgene also demonstrated inappropriate expression of the transgene in most proximal colonic crypts. However, the additional 3.3 kilobases of upstream sequence resulted in much more rapid extinction of reporter expression, leaving by 5 months of age only scattered single crypts with detectable levels of hGH. This age-related extinction of L-FABP/hGH expression did not involve enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells in the (proximal) small intestine. These results indicate that cis-acting elements outside of nucleotides -4000 to +21 are necessary to fully modulate suppression of colonic L-FABP expression. They also define fundamental changes in colonic epithelial cell populations during adult life. Our data suggest that (i) a single stem cell gives rise to all cells that populate a given colonic crypt, (ii) stem cells represented in several adjacent crypts may be derived from a common progenitor, and (iii) such a progenitor cell may repopulate colonic crypts with stem cells during adult life. Since each colonic crypt contains the amplified descendants of its stem cell, transgenes may be powerful tools for characterizing the spatial and biological features of gut stem cells and their progenitors during life.\r"

Protein synthesis is required for these divisions, and new proteins appear after fertilization. Others proteins however, which are synthesized in the unfertilized egg, are no longer made in the early embryo. To identify such proteins, a differential screen of an egg cDNA library gave nine clones corresponding to mRNAs that are deadenylylated soon after fertilization. The sequence of one of these clones (Eg1) revealed a high homology to p34cdc2, the kinase subunit of maturation-promoting factor. Only 12 amino acids in the deduced amino acid sequence were unique to Eg1 when its sequence was compared to all other known examples of cdc2. Despite this strong similarity, however, Eg1 was unable to complement a yeast cdc2- mutant in Schizosaccharomyces pombe or a cdc28 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four Eg1 transcripts, two major and two minor, were found in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos. These RNAs appeared very early (stage I) in oogenesis and their level remained constant until the midblastula transition, at which time they declined. Eg1 RNA is found in the poly(A)+ fraction of oocytes only between the time of meiotic maturation and fertilization--that is to say, in the unfertilized egg. At fertilization the RNA loses its poly(A) tail and at the same time leaves the polyribosomes.\r"

Previously, we identified the C terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen as the region of the fibrinogen molecule that contains a ligand for CD11b/CD18 (complement receptor 3) on phorbol ester-stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In contrast, we report here that neutrophils stimulated with tumor necrosis factor adhere to fibrinogen-coated surfaces, but not to human serum albumin-coated surfaces, via the integrin CD11c/CD18 (p150/95). Monoclonal antibodies LeuM5 and 3.9, which are directed against the alpha subunit of CD11c/CD18, but not monoclonal antibodies OKM10 and OKM1, which are directed against the alpha subunit of CD11b/CD18, inhibit the adhesion of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated neutrophils to fibrinogen-coated surfaces. To identify the site on fibrinogen recognized by CD11c/CD18, we have examined the adhesion of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated neutrophils to surfaces coated with various fibrinogen fragments. Stimulated neutrophils adhere to surfaces coated with the N-terminal disulfide knot fragment of fibrinogen or fibrinogen fragment E. Moreover, peptides containing the sequence Gly-Pro-Arg (which corresponds to amino acids 17-19 of the N-terminal region of the A alpha chain of fibrinogen), and monoclonal antibody LeuM5, block tumor necrosis factor-stimulated neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen and to the N-terminal disulfide knot fragment of fibrinogen. Thus, CD11c/CD18 on tumor necrosis factor-stimulated neutrophils functions as a fibrinogen receptor that recognizes the sequence Gly-Pro-Arg in the N-terminal domain of the A alpha chain of fibrinogen.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mice provide a remarkable experimental setting for the study of nuclear architecture. The three-dimensional localization and fine structure of a foreign DNA within the mouse genome can be conveniently followed by using high-resolution in situ hybridization. Foreign DNAs designed with specific characteristics, such as base bias, sequence motif(s), and size can stably integrate into finite positions on host chromosomes. Thus the relative importance of each of these characteristics in determining the three-dimensional nuclear position and the detailed morphology of the transgene can be evaluated in different cell types. The aim of this study was to evaluate a transgene with sequence characteristics that might contribute to the de novo formation of heterochromatin in interphase nuclei. The structure of a phenotypically silent 11-megabase transgene, containing tandem repeats of beta-globin-pBR sequences integrated into the peritelomeric region of both mouse chromosome 3 homologs, was determined in adult brain cells. Neurons that are largely euchromatic were especially informative in three-dimensional studies of transgene position. The two transgenic loci behaved much like centromeric or paracentromeric A + T-rich satellite DNAs of comparable length from a single chromosome; one or both transgene domains localized together with centromeric satellite DNA on the nucleolus. This is an unusual nuclear position for a telomeric or chromosome arm region that does not contain a substantial amount of constitutively heterochromatic satellite DNA. G + C richness did not prevent these regions from assembling as dense heterochromatic bodies of approximately 1 micron3 in volume. Ultrastructurally, transgenic domains were often intimately connected with constitutive heterochromatin and were highly condensed. Labeled supercoils, formed by a discrete approximately 250-nm-wide fiber, were observed in oblique thin sections through the center of the domain. The structural data were consistent with negligible transcriptional activity detected for this locus, as well as the predicted conformation of constitutive heterochromatin. Interestingly, in transgenic but not control mice, a substantial number of large neurons, including approximately 30% of cerebellar Purkinje cells, showed excessive invaginations of the nuclear membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) particles are generated by budding of preformed cytoplasmic nucleocapsids into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes containing the three viral envelope proteins (L, M, and S). We have examined the contributions of the envelope proteins to virion assembly by using cultured hepatoma cells transfected with mutant HBV genomes bearing lesions in the envelope coding regions. We show here that HBV nucleocapsids are not released from cells without expression of envelope proteins, implying an active role for these proteins in viral morphogenesis. S and L but not M proteins are necessary for virion production. L protein over-expression inhibits virion release, just as it inhibits the release of subviral hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles. Mutant L proteins that are no longer capable of retaining HBsAg particles in the ER still allow virion formation, indicating that this ER retention reaction is not required for viral budding. Myristoylation of L protein is also dispensable for virion formation. A chimeric protein bearing foreign epitopes fused to the S protein can be incorporated into virions when coexpressed with the wild-type envelope proteins. Models for the dependence of virion formation on both L and S proteins are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91126057\r", 
  ".W": "The cerebellum contains a hexadecapeptide, termed cerebellin, that is conserved in sequence from human to chicken. Three independent, overlapping cDNA clones have been isolated from a human cerebellum cDNA library that encode the cerebellin sequence. The longest clone codes for a protein of 193 amino acids that we term precerebellin. This protein has a significant similarity (31.3% identity, 52.2% similarity) to the globular (non-collagen-like) region of the B chain of human complement component C1q. The region of relatedness extends over approximately 145 amino acids located in the carboxyl terminus of both proteins. Unlike C1q B chain, no collagen-like motifs are present in the amino-terminal regions of precerebellin. The amino terminus of precerebellin contains three possible N-linked glycosylation sites. Although hydrophobic amino acids are clustered at the amino terminus, they do not conform to the classical signal-peptide motif, and no other obvious membrane-spanning domains are predicted from the cDNA sequence. The cDNA predicts that the cerebellin peptide is flanked by Val-Arg and Glu-Pro residues. Therefore, cerebellin is not liberated from precerebellin by the classical dibasic amino acid proteolytic-cleavage mechanism seen in many neuropeptide precursors. In Northern (RNA) blots, precerebellin transcripts, with four distinct sizes (1.8, 2.3, 2.7, and 3.0 kilobases), are abundant in cerebellum. These transcripts are present at either very low or undetectable levels in other brain areas and extraneural structures. A similar pattern of cerebellin precursor transcripts are seen in rat, mouse, and human cerebellum. Furthermore, a partial genomic fragment from mouse shows the same bands in Northern blots as the human cDNA clone. During rat development, precerebellin transcripts mirror the level of cerebellin peptide. Low levels of precerebellin mRNA are seen at birth. Levels increase modestly from postpartum day 1 to 8, then increase more dramatically between day 5 and 15, and eventually reach peak values between day 21 and 56. Because cerebellin-like immunoreactivity is associated with Purkinje cell postsynaptic structures, these data raise interesting possibilities concerning the function of the cerebellin precursor in synaptic physiology.\r"

Out- mutants of Er. chrysanthemi are unable to export any of these proteins beyond the periplasm and are severely reduced in virulence. We have cloned out genes from Er. chrysanthemi in the stable, low-copy-number cosmid pCPP19 by complementing several transposon-induced mutations. The cloned out genes were clustered in a 12-kilobase chromosomal DNA region, complemented all existing out mutations in Er. chrysanthemi EC16, and enabled Escherichia coli strains to efficiently secrete the extracellular pectic enzymes produced from cloned Er. chrysanthemi genes, while retaining the periplasmic marker protein beta-lactamase. DNA sequencing of a 2.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment within the out cluster revealed four genes arranged colinearly and sharing substantial similarity with the Klebsiella pneumoniae genes pulH, pulI, pulJ, and pulK, which are necessary for pullulanase secretion. However, K. pneumoniae cells harboring the cloned Er. chrysanthemi pelE gene were unable to secrete the Erwinia pectate lyase. Furthermore, the Er. chrysanthemi Out system was unable to secrete an extracellular pectate lyase encoded by a gene from a closely related plant pathogen. Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora. The results suggest that these enterobacteria secrete polysaccharidases by a conserved mechanism whose protein-recognition capacities have diverged.\r"

Rev protein was expressed and purified from insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Chemical and RNase probes were used to analyze the structure of the RRE and the regions involved in Rev binding. Increased reactivity to single-strand-specific probes of nucleotides in two helical domains indicates that Rev binding induces conformational changes in the RRE. Binding of Rev to the RRE primarily protects helical segments and adjacent nucleotides in domain II. A Rev unit binding site is proposed that consists of a six-base-pair helical segment and three adjacent nucleotides. The data also suggest that multiple Rev proteins bind to repeated structural elements of the RRE.\r"

  ".U": "91126061\r", 
  ".W": "Synthesis of the iron-storage protein ferritin is thought to be regulated at the translational level by the cytosolic content of chelatable iron. This response to iron is regulated by the iron-modulated binding to ferritin mRNAs of a repressor protein, the iron regulatory element-binding protein. From measurements made in a cell-free system, regulation of the iron regulatory element-binding protein has been recently suggested to involve direct interaction with hemin. The following observations on the synthesis of ferritin and of heme oxygenase (HO), the heme-degrading enzyme, in rat fibroblasts or hepatoma cells lead us to conclude that chelatable iron is a direct physiological regulator of ferritin synthesis in intact cells: (i) the inhibitor of heme degradation, tin mesoporphyrin IX, reduces the ability of exogenous hemin to induce ferritin synthesis but enhances HO synthesis; (ii) the iron chelator desferal suppresses the ability of hemin to induce synthesis of ferritin but not of HO; (iii) the heme synthesis inhibitor succinylacetone does not block iron induction of ferritin synthesis; (iv) there is no apparent relationship between the ability of various metalloporphyrins to inactivate the iron regulatory element-binding protein in cell-free extracts and their capacity to induce ferritin synthesis in intact cells; (v) administered inorganic iron significantly induces the synthesis of ferritin but not of HO; (vi) addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid to stimulate heme synthesis represses the ability of inorganic iron to induce ferritin synthesis while activating HO synthesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that (i) release of iron by HO plays an essential role in the induction of ferritin synthesis by heme and (ii) chelatable iron can regulate ferritin synthesis independently of heme formation.\r"

The system consists of two types of transgenic mouse strains, targets and transactivators. A target strain bears a transgene controlled by yeast regulatory sequences (UAS) that respond only to the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4. A transactivator strain expresses an active GAL4 gene that can be driven by any selected promoter. The current paradigm uses the murine growth factor int-2 cDNA as the target gene and the GAL4 gene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat as the transactivator. Both target and transactivator strains are phenotypically normal. By contrast, the bigenic offspring of these two strains express high levels of the target int-2 gene in each organ expressing the GAL4 transactivator. They also display a characteristic dominant int-2 phenotype that consists of epithelial hyperplasia in mammary and salivary glands, as well as prostatic and epididymal hypertrophy, which results in male sterility.\r"

  ".U": "91126064\r", 
  ".W": "In porcine aortic endothelial cells, the 21-amino acid peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is formed from a 39-amino acid intermediate called \"big endothelin-1\" (big ET-1) by a putative ET-converting enzyme (ECE) that cleaves the 39-mer at the bond between Trp-21 and Val-22. Since big ET-1 has only 1/100-1/150th the contractile activity of ET-1, inhibition of ECE should effectively block the biological effects of ET-1. Big ET-1 injected intravenously into anesthetized rats produces a sustained pressor response that presumably is due to conversion of big ET-1 into ET-1 by ECE. We determined the type of protease activity responsible for this conversion by evaluating the effectiveness of protease inhibitors in blocking the pressor response to big ET-1 in ganglion-blocked anesthetized rats. The serine protease inhibitor leupeptin, the cysteinyl protease inhibitor E-64, and the metalloprotease inhibitors captopril and kelatorphan were all ineffective at blocking the pressor response to big ET-1. However, the metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and thiorphan dose-dependently inhibited the pressor response to big ET-1, although phosphoramidon was substantially more potent than thiorphan. None of the inhibitors blocked the pressor response to ET-1 and none had any effect on mean arterial pressure when administered alone. In a rabbit lung membrane preparation, ECE activity was identified that was blocked by the metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and 1,10-phenanthroline in a concentration-dependent manner. This enzyme converted big ET-1 to a species of ET that comigrated on HPLC with ET-1 and produced an ET-like contraction in isolated rat aortic rings. Our results suggest that the physiologically relevant ECE is a metalloprotease.\r"

However, transcription of closed circular DNA is stimulated when negative supercoils are introduced by the addition of DNA topoisomerase II and supercoiling factor purified from the posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori. Dissection of transcription into pre- and postinitiation steps by the use of Sarkosyl reveals that DNA supercoiling promotes formation of a preinitiation complex. Furthermore, order of addition experiments suggest that DNA supercoiling facilitates a functional binding of transcription factor IID to the promoter.\r"

A candidate gene has recently been described for the rds defect [Travis, G. H., Brennan, M. B., Danielson, P. E., Kozak, C. & Sutcliffe, J. G. (1989) Nature (London) 338, 70-73]. Neither the identity of the normal gene product nor its intracellular localization had been determined. We report here that the amino acid sequence of the bovine photoreceptor-cell protein peripherin, which was previously localized to the rim region of the photoreceptor disk membrane, is 92.5% identical to the sequence of the mouse protein encoded by the normal rds gene. The differences between the two sequences can be attributed to species variation. Monoclonal antibodies were used with Western blot analysis to localize the wild-type mouse peripherin/rds protein to isolated mouse rod outer segments and to show that it, like bovine peripherin, exists as two subunits linked by one or more disulfide bonds. The relative amounts of peripherin/rds protein and rhodopsin in retinal extracts of normal and rds mutant mice were also compared. Identification of peripherin as the protein encoded by the normal rds gene and its localization to membranes of rod outer segments will serve as a basis for studies directed toward defining the role of this protein in the morphogenesis and maintenance of the outer segment and toward understanding the mechanism by which the rds mutation causes retinal degeneration.\r"

Peptides with the highest affinity had the structure Cys-A1-A2-X, where positions A1 and A2 are occupied by aliphatic amino acids and position X is occupied by a COOH-terminal methionine, serine, or phenylalanine. Charged residues reduced affinity slightly at the A1 position and much more drastically at the A2 and X positions. Effective inhibitors included tetrapeptides corresponding to the COOH termini of all animal cell proteins known to be farnesylated. In contrast, the tetrapeptide Cys-Ala-Ile-Leu (CAIL), which corresponds to the COOH termini of several neural guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein gamma subunits, did not compete in the farnesyl-transfer assay. Inasmuch as several of these proteins are geranylgeranylated, the data suggest that the two isoprenes (farnesyl and geranylgeranyl) are transferred by different enzymes. A biotinylated heptapeptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of p21Ki-rasB was farnesylated, suggesting that at least some of the peptides serve as substrates for the transferase. The data are consistent with a model in which a hydrophobic pocket in the protein farnesyltransferase recognizes tetrapeptides through interactions with the cysteine and the last two amino acids.\r"

During a 3-sec nonsaturating light stimulus, approximately 50% of the Ca content was released from the ER. Light stimulation also caused a highly significant increase in the Mg content of the ER; the ratio of Mg uptake to Ca released was approximately 0.7.

  ".W": "Intrinsic horizontal axon collaterals in the striate cortex of adult cats specifically link columns having the same preferred orientation; consequently, retrograde tracer injections result in intrinsic labeling that is sharply clustered. We have previously shown that the normal development of this circuitry involves the emergence of crude clusters from an unclustered pattern during the second postnatal week. Crude clusters are later refined to the adult level of specificity by the selective rearrangement of axonal arbors that initially project to incorrect orientation columns. Here we report that depriving animals of patterned visual experience by binocular lid suture prior to natural eye opening had no discernible effect on the emergence of crude clusters. In contrast, cluster refinement was dramatically affected by binocular deprivation. Injections of retrograde tracers in the striate cortex of animals binocularly deprived for greater than 1 month revealed only crude clusters, indicating that horizontal axon collaterals projecting to incorrect orientation columns were retained well past the age when they normally would have been eliminated. Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells from 6-week-old binocularly deprived animals had abnormal distributions of intrinsic horizontal axon collaterals that mirrored the lack of cluster refinement. The radial clustering of their horizontal collaterals was considerably less precise than normal. These cells, nevertheless, developed many of the features of normal mature arbors, including the distal axonal branches not seen in arbors from younger animals with normal visual experience. Together, these results indicate that axonal rearrangements occurred, but with reduced specificity. Thus, binocular deprivation did not simply arrest the development of this orientation-specific circuit at an immature state but limited the accuracy with which axon collaterals were added or eliminated. We suggest that development of this orientation-specific circuitry, like ocular dominance column segregation, may depend on temporal correlation of activity for regulation of axonal rearrangement. The specificity of rearrangement may be degraded in binocularly deprived cats because they do not experience sharply oriented visual stimuli necessary for concurrent activation of same-orientation columns.\r"

  ".W": "An essential step in the signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli is the control of the protein kinase activity of CheA by the chemotaxis receptor proteins. This control requires the participation of the CheW protein. Although the biochemical nature of the coupling between the receptors and the kinase is unknown, it is likely that CheW interacts with the receptors and with CheA. In this communication, we report direct measurement of a physical interaction between CheW and CheA. We utilized the equilibrium column chromatography method of Hummel and Dreyer to show that CheW and CheA exhibit reversible binding with the stoichiometry of two CheW monomers per CheA dimer. CheW was found to exist as monomers and CheA was found to exist as dimers by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. The dissociation constant for the CheW-CheA interaction (in 160 mM KCl/5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4 at 4 degrees C) was determined to be in the physiologically relevant range of 17 microM. No evidence for cooperativity in the association of CheW with CheA was found.\r"

  ".W": "GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which regulates the activities of Ras proteins, is implicated in mitogenic signal transduction by growth-factor receptors and oncoproteins with tyrosine kinase activity. Oncogenic viral Src (p60v-src) encoded in Rous sarcoma virus possesses elevated tyrosine kinase activity compared with its nononcogenic normal homolog, cellular Src (p60c-src). To examine molecular interactions between GAP and the two Src kinases, immunoprecipitates of Src or GAP prepared from cell lystates were resolved by gel electrophoresis and analyzed by an immunoblot procedure with antibodies to GAP or Src used as probes. Results suggest that p60c-src is associated with a complex containing GAP in immunoprecipitates from lysates of normal rat and chicken cells. However, GAP is not phosphorylated in p60c-src immunoprecipitates subjected to in vitro kinase reactions. By contrast, GAP undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation in vitro when immunoprecipitates of p60v-src prepared from transformed cell lysates are incubated with ATP. Our findings suggest that p60v-src and p60c-src associate with complexes containing GAP and provide a biochemical link between both kinases and GAP/Ras signal transduction pathways. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GAP has a role in mediating normal functions of p60c-src as well as oncogenic activities of p60v-src.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of a stromal cell-derived cytokine designated interleukin 11 (IL-11) on the proliferation of murine hemopoietic progenitors in methylcellulose culture. COS cell-conditioned medium containing IL-11 supported formation of granulocyte/macrophage colonies and a small number of multilineage colonies including blast cell colonies in cultures of marrow cells from normal mice. When tested with marrow cells harvested 2 days after injection of 5-fluorouracil at 150 mg/kg, IL-11 enhanced interleukin 3-dependent colony formation, whereas IL-11 alone supported only scant colony formation. Serial observations (mapping studies) of cultures of post-5-fluorouracil spleen cells indicated that the mechanism of the synergistic effect of IL-11 is to shorten the dormant period of stem cells, an effect very similar to that of interleukin 6. When pooled blast cells were plated into medium containing IL-11 and erythropoietin, only macrophage colonies were observed. Thus, IL-11 can directly support the proliferation of committed macrophage progenitors and, and like interleukin 6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, act synergistically with interleukin 3 to shorten the Go period of early progenitors.\r"

The 10 H-ferritin muteins exhibited alterations of various regions of the molecule, including ones exposed on the outer surface, on the inner cavity, and on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic channels and of the four-alpha-helix bundle forming the subunit structure. They were stable and were electrophoretically analogous to wild-type H-ferritin. The muteins showed in vitro and in vivo myelosuppressive activity analogous to wild type, except for mutein 222, which was totally inactive and which lacked ferroxidase activity. Recombinant human L-ferritin, devoid of ferroxidase activity, was also inactive as a suppressor. The results demonstrate that H-ferritin myelosuppressive and ferroxidase activities are linked. One possibility is that ferroxidase activity may interfere with the cellular uptake of transferrin iron that is needed for cell proliferation, an interpretation consistent with the presently described ability of hemin to overcome H-ferritin suppressive effects.\r"

In the somatosensory cortex, topographic maps appear capable of lifelong modifications in response to alterations in the periphery. One factor proposed to influence this adaptational ability is the presence of acetylcholine in the cortex. The studies presented here, using the 2-deoxyglucose technique, demonstrate that the unilateral removal of a digit in cats, followed by stimulation of an adjacent digit, produces a pattern of metabolic activity in the somatosensory cortex that is dramatically expanded when compared with the opposite (normal) hemisphere. In contrast, experiments in which the somatosensory cortex was depleted of acetylcholine and the animal received a similar amputation led not to patterns of expanded metabolic activity, but rather to reductions in the evoked metabolic distribution. These studies implicate acetylcholine in normal map formation and in the maintenance of the capacity of cortical maps to adapt to changes in the periphery.\r"

To evaluate the structure and regulation of molecular components of the synapse, we investigated the expression of SNAP-25 in the developing chicken nervous system. Analysis of SNAP-25 cDNA clones demonstrated that the chicken homologue is identical in amino acid sequence to the mouse protein. In chicken retina and neural tube, the onset of SNAP-25 mRNA and protein expression was found to correspond to the time of synaptogenesis. These results suggest that SNAP-25 plays a role in the physiology of mature nerve terminals and that its expression may be regulated by specific cell-cell interactions occurring during synapse formation.\r"

We report here that LAT is actually a uniquely stable intron.

  ".W": "Cardiac fibroblasts are mainly responsible for the synthesis of major extracellular matrix proteins in the heart, including fibrillar collagen types I and III and fibronectin. In this report we show that these cells, when stimulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), acquire certain myocyte-specific properties. Cultured cardiac fibroblasts from adult rabbit heart were treated with TGF-beta 1 (10-15 ng/ml) for different periods of time. Northern hybridization analysis of total RNA showed that cells treated with TGF-beta 1 for 24 hr expressed mRNA corresponding to sarcomeric actin mRNA. Immunofluorescence staining and light microscopy showed that cultured cardiac fibroblasts treated with TGF-beta 1 became stained with a monoclonal antibody to muscle-specific actin. After treatment of quiescent cells with TGF-beta 1, cell proliferation (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) was moderately increased (1.5-fold, P less than 0.001). NIH 3T3 cells and human skin fibroblasts, treated with TGF-beta 1, did not express sarcomeric actin mRNA. Treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with the mitogenic agent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or with norepinephrine, angiotensin II, or interleukin 1 beta did not induce myocyte-specific actin mRNA. Cultured cardiac fibroblasts at the subconfluent stage, when exposed to TGF-beta 1 in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, gave rise to a second generation of slowly growing cells that expressed muscle-specific actin filaments. Our findings demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts can be made to differentiate into cells that display many characteristics of cardiac myocytes. TGF-beta 1 seems to be a specific inducer of such conversion.\r"

However, a tetramer of the enhancer functions in virtually all T-cell lines tested, including alpha beta T-cell lines, but not in other cell types.

  ".W": "Although there is general agreement that L-glutamate can produce a depolarizing inward current to account for the hyperpolarizing (OFF) bipolar cell response, the conductance mechanism underlying the depolarizing (ON) response has been difficult to establish satisfactorily. To investigate the ionic bases of the center responses, we studied the whole-cell currents controlled by L-glutamate and its analogues in solitary bipolar cells from salamander retina. We report here two groups of isolated bipolar cells: one group responded to L-glutamate with the previously described inward current [Attwell, D., Mobbs, P., Tessier-Lavigne, M. & Wilson, M. (1987) J. Physiol. (London) 387, 125-161] and a second group showed an outward current that reversed at about -70 mV. Both were associated with an increase in membrane conductance. In addition, DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, a compound diagnostic for ON-bipolar cell activity [Slaughter, M. M. & Miller, R. F. (1981) Science 211, 182-185], elicited outward currents that closely resembled those seen in response to L-glutamate and, furthermore, that were shown to arise from an increase in conductance to potassium ions. Thus the presence of two distinct conductances controlled by L-glutamate in solitary cells would provide one mechanism for generating the ON and OFF light responses at the bipolar cell level in the intact retina.\r"

A guanine----cytosine transversion creates a donor splice site in this Alu, activating a cryptic acceptor splice site at its 5' end and causing splice-mediated insertion of an Alu fragment into the mature ornithine-delta-aminotransferase mRNA. We note that the complement of the Alu consensus sequence has at least two cryptic acceptor sites and several potential donor sequences and predict that similar mutations will be found in other genes.\r"

The ability of these different forms to transduce the hormonal message was estimated by their capacity to stimulate transcription by using the promoter of a milk protein gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence. Experiments were performed in serum-free conditions to avoid the effect of lactogenic factors present in serum. An approximately 17-fold induction of CAT activity was obtained in the presence of prolactin when the long form of the prolactin receptor was expressed, whereas no induction was observed when the short form was expressed. The present results clearly establish that only the long form of the prolactin receptor is involved in milk protein gene transcription.\r"

It is synthesized as a prepro precursor with an N-terminal extension composed of a 21-amino-acid signal peptide and a 16-amino-acid propeptide. A total of 48 base pairs, corresponding to the nucleotide sequence that encodes the propeptide, was deleted from a cDNA clone for sporamin. This delta pro mutant sequence, as well as the sequence of the wild-type sporamin cDNA, was placed downstream from the promoter of the 35S transcript from cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced into the genome of suspension-cultured tobacco cells by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In contrast to the vacuolar localization of sporamin in cells that expressed the wild-type precursor, sporamin was secreted into the culture medium from cells in which the delta pro precursor was expressed. The secreted form of sporamin was shorter by two amino acids at its N terminus than authentic sporamin; it migrated anomalously during electrophoresis on SDS/polyacrylamide gel as a result of the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges, as does authentic sporamin. The kinetics of secretion of sporamin from the cell were similar to those of proteins normally secreted by the host tobacco cells. These results indicate that the propeptide of the precursor to sporamin is required for correct targeting of sporamin to the vacuole and that proteins can be secreted from plant cells by a bulk-flow default pathway in the absence of a functional sorting signal.\r"

We report here a reconstruction of human differentiation based on 100 DNA polymorphisms tested in five populations from four continents. The results agree with earlier conclusions based on other classes of genetic markers but reveal that Europeans do not fit a simple model of independently evolving populations with equal evolutionary rates. Evolutionary models involving early admixture are compatible with the data. Taking one such model into account, we examined through simulation whether random genetic drift alone might explain the variation among gene frequencies across populations and genes. A measure of variation among populations was calculated for each polymorphism, and its distribution for the 100 polymorphisms was compared with that expected for a drift-only hypothesis. At least two-thirds of the polymorphisms appear to be selectively neutral, but there are significant deviations at the two ends of the observed distribution of the measure of variation: a slight excess of polymorphisms with low variation and a greater excess with high variation. This indicates that a few DNA polymorphisms are affected by natural selection, rarely heterotic, and more often disruptive, while most are selectively neutral.\r"

The highest dose of SB-75 (71.4 micrograms/day) caused a greater inhibition of prostate cancer growth than [D-Trp6]LH-RH as based on measurement of tumor volume and percentage change in tumor volume. Doses of 23.8 and 47.6 micrograms of SB-75 per day induced a partial and submaximal decrease, respectively, in tumor weight and volume. Tumor doubling time was the longest (50 days) with the high dose of SB-75 vs. 15 days for controls. The body weights were unchanged. The weights of testes, seminal vesicles, and ventral prostate were greatly reduced in all three groups that received SB-75, and testosterone levels were decreased to nondetectable values in the case of the two higher doses of SB-75. LH levels were also diminished. Similar results were obtained in the second experiment, in which the animals were treated for a period of 8 weeks with microgranules of SB-75. Therapy with microgranules of SB-75 significantly decreased tumor growth as measured by the final tumor volume, the percentage change from the initial tumor volume, and the reduction in tumor weight. The results indicate that antagonist SB-75, released from sustained delivery systems, can produce a state of chemical castration and effectively inhibit the growth of experimental prostate cancers. The efficacy of the antagonist SB-75 in inhibiting androgen-dependent Dunning prostatic carcinoma and the absence of side effects suggest its possible usefulness for the treatment of hormone-sensitive tumors.\r"

The activity of ferrochelatase is deficient in the inherited disease protoporphyria. In this study, murine ferrochelatase cDNAs were obtained by screening cDNA libraries with an oligonucleotide probe. The derived amino acid sequence of murine ferrochelatase has 47% identity with the recently cloned Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatase, but it is not significantly similar to other published sequences. Results of Southern blotting are consistent with a single murine ferrochelatase gene, while Northern blotting demonstrates two ferrochelatase transcripts in all tissues examined. The ferrochelatase protein and mRNAs have different relative concentrations in different tissues. The cloning of murine ferrochelatase cDNAs provides the basis for future studies on ferrochelatase gene expression and on the identification of the molecular defect in protoporphyria.\r"

Expression of these AcChoRs can be regulated by agents that stimulate intracellular cAMP levels with the result that increased numbers of cell-surface AcChoRs are produced. Theophylline, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, cholera toxin, and forskolin stimulated AcChoR cell-surface expression 1.2-, 1.6-, 2.2-, and 2.3-fold, respectively. cAMP-stimulated expression is mediated through a posttranslational mechanism, and the observed increase in surface AcChoRs correlates with increased lifetimes of each newly synthesized subunit. Increased subunit lifetimes are not observed in cell lines expressing each subunit individually, indicating that subunit stabilization arises through heterologous subunit-subunit interactions.\r"

When transformed with this plasmid, a bop- insertion mutant of H. halobium yielded purple (Pum+) colonies. The insertion at the chromosomal bop locus remained intact in transformed cells, indicating that the plasmid bop gene was responsible for the Pum+ phenotype. bR was induced in early stationary phase in both wild-type and transformed cells. The final level of bR in transformed cells was 25-40% of that in wild type. The lower level of expression was presumably due to plasmid instability. Purple membrane purified from transformed strains had absorption and visible CD properties similar to wild type and contained bR in a hexagonal lattice with the same unit-cell dimension as wild type. The structure of bR from wild-type and transformed strains was identical at a resolution of 7.2 A.

This observation has implications for gene regulation, gene amplification, genetic diversity, and the maintenance of tandemly repeated gene families in the Leishmania genome as well as in closely related organisms, including Trypanosoma brucei. Two plasmids containing nonoverlapping deletions of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, as well as the neomycin-resistance gene, were cotransfected into L. enriettii. Analysis of the DNA from these cells by Southern blotting and plasmid rescue revealed that a full-length or doubly deleted CAT gene could be reconstructed by homologous crossing-over and/or gene conversion between the two deletion plasmids. Additionally, parasites cotransfected with pALT-Neo and pALT-CAT-S, a plasmid containing two copies of the chimeric alpha-tubulin-CAT gene, resulted in G418-resistant parasites expressing high levels of CAT activity. The structure of the DNA within these cells, as shown by Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction, is that which would be expected from a homologous exchange event occurring between the two plasmids.\r"

The coding region is 987 base pairs and encodes a predicted protein of 34 kDa. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region shows 88% identity to the human SCL gene, and the amino acid sequence is 94% identical. The HLH motif and upstream hydrophilic region are entirely conserved in the murine and human proteins. The identity between the mouse and human sequences was less marked in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Two murine SCL transcripts that differ in the 3' noncoding region have been detected in fetal liver and various cell lines. Variation was also observed in the 5' untranslated region. Interestingly, immediately downstream of the protein-termination codon, both the human SCL sequence and the murine homolog share an E-box element--the suggested target site for DNA binding of HLH proteins. The murine SCL homolog was mapped to the central part of chromosome 4.\r"

  ".W": "A previous study showed that the human insulin receptor (IR) could be activated by insertion of a 3' portion of the cDNA encoding the beta subunit into a retrovirus genome to form a Gag-IR fusion protein. While capable of transforming cells in culture, this IR cDNA-containing virus, called UIR, was not able to induce tumors in animals. Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous sarcomagenic variant called UIR19t from the parental UIR. UIR19t was molecularly cloned, sequenced, and found to harbor two mutations. A 44-amino acid deletion immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain of the Gag-IR fusion protein removes all the extracellular sequence of the IR remaining in the original UIR construct. In addition, a single nucleotide deletion at the 3' end results in truncation and replacement of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids by 4 new amino acids. The specific kinase activity of UIR19t is 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the parental UIR. However, no new cellular substrates were detected in UIR19t-transformed cells as compared to UIR cells. Viruses containing either the 5' or the 3' deletion mutation were constructed and assessed for their biological function. Our data indicate that the 5' deletion alone is sufficient to confer tumorigenic ability. We conclude that sequence immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain imposes a negative effect on the transforming and tumorigenic potential of the Gag-IR fusion protein.\r"

The reaction is best described as heme release into water followed by quick engulfment by apomyoglobin. The energetics of the activated process are large and interpreted as connected to both polypeptide motions during release and the ordering of water around the heme during solvation. The free energy required to break the iron(III)-ligand 5 (L5) bond is a minor but crucial portion of the activation free energy. Donor-acceptor protein interactions are not involved in the transfer. Fast heme release from inactive protein has also been observed. Apoprotein recombination with porphyrins and hemes suggest that this lack of activity is a result of Fe-L5 bond breaking.\r"

To localize molecular markers flanking the t(11;22) (q24;q12) breakpoint that occurs in virtually all cases of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, high-resolution chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization was carried out using a panel of cosmid clones localized and ordered on chromosome 11q. The location of the Ewing sarcoma translocation breakpoint was determined relative to the nearest two cosmid markers on 11q, clones 23.2 and 5.8, through the analysis of metaphase chromosome hybridization. By in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei, the approximate physical separation of these two markers was determined. In both Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, cosmid clone 5.8 is translocated from chromosome 11q24 to the derivative chromosome 22 and a portion of chromosome 22q12 carrying the leukemia inhibitory factor gene is translocated to the derivative chromosome 11. The physical distance between the flanking cosmid markers on chromosome 11 was determined to be in the range of 1000 kilobases, and genomic analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no abnormalities over a region of 650 kilobases in the vicinity of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene on chromosome 22. This approach localizes the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint to a small region on chromosome 11q24 and provides a rapid and precise technique for the molecular characterization of chromosomal aberrations.\r"

The basic unit of the model is a single lipid chain with field parameters adjusted to fit the 2H order parameters and the frequency-dependent 13C NMR T1 relaxation times of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The chain configurations obtained from the trajectory are used to construct a representation of the bilayer. The resulting lipid assembly is consistent with NMR, neutron diffraction, surface area, and density data.

  ".W": "We report here the presence of fast subthreshold oscillatory potentials recorded in vitro from neurons within layer 4 of the guinea pig frontal cortex. Two types of oscillatory neurons were recorded: (i) One type exhibited subthreshold oscillations whose frequency increased with membrane depolarization and encompassed a range of 10-45 Hz. Action potentials in this type of neuron demonstrated clear after-hyperpolarizations. (ii) The second type of neuron was characterized by narrow-frequency oscillations near 35-50 Hz. These oscillations often outlasted the initiating depolarizing stimulus. No calcium component could be identified in their action potential. In both types of cell the subthreshold oscillations were tetrodotoxin-sensitive, indicating that the depolarizing phase of the oscillation was generated by a voltage-dependent sodium conductance. The initial depolarizing phase was followed by a potassium conductance responsible for the falling phase of the oscillatory wave. In both types of cell, the subthreshold oscillation could trigger spikes at the oscillatory frequency, if the membrane was sufficiently depolarized. Combining intracellular recordings with Lucifer yellow staining showed that the narrow-frequency oscillatory activity was produced by a sparsely spinous interneuron located in layer 4 of the cortex. This neuron has extensive local axonal collaterals that ramify in layers 3 and 4 such that they may contribute to the columnar synchronization of activity in the 40- to 50-Hz range. Cortical activity in this frequency range has been proposed as the basis for the \"conjunctive properties\" of central nervous system networks.\r"

The extracellular domain of the human TSH receptor was divided into five regions that were replaced, either singly or in various combinations, with homologous regions of the rat LH/CG receptor. The chimeric receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The data obtained suggest that the carboxyl region of the extracellular domain (amino acid residues 261-418) and particularly the middle region (residues 171-260) play a role in signal transduction. The possibility is also raised of an interaction between the amino and carboxyl regions of the extracellular domain in the process of signal transduction. With respect to hormone binding, substitution of the entire extracellular domain of the LH/CG receptor for the corresponding region of the TSH receptor resulted in high-affinity human CG binding with complete loss of TSH binding. Surprisingly, however, there was at least one chimera with a substitution at each of the five domains that still retained high-affinity TSH binding. Substitution of residues 1-170 of the TSH receptor with the corresponding region of the LH/CG receptor was associated with the retention of high-affinity TSH binding but ligand specificity was lost in that TSH and human CG could interact functionally with the receptor. In summary, these studies suggest that the middle region and carboxyl half of the extracellular domain of the TSH receptor are involved in signal transduction and that the TSH-binding region is likely to span the entire extracellular domain, with multiple discontinuous contact sites.\r"

By using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, C----A transversions at the first base and A----T transversions or A----G transitions at the second base of c-Ha-ras codon 61 were detected in 20-60% of spontaneous or carcinogen-induced liver tumors of the C3H/He, CBA, CF1, and B6C3F1 mouse strains, which are highly susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis. No such mutations, however, could be found in any of the 31 liver tumors of the insensitive C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse strains or in any of the 35 liver tumors of the comparatively resistant Wistar rat. Further analyses of c-Ha-ras codon 12 mutations in liver tumors from the three insensitive rodent strains also failed to give any positive results. In early precancerous liver lesions, c-Ha-ras codon 61 mutations were found in 13-14% of lesions of the sensitive C3H/He and B6C3F1 mouse strains but not in any of the 34 lesions of the insensitive C57BL/6J mouse. Taken together, our results indicate a close correlation between the mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of the different rodent strains and their susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis, whereby the mutations appear to provide a selective growth advantage, leading to a clonal expansion of the mutated liver cell population, only in livers of sensitive but not of insensitive strains.\r"

The backbone spectral region (222 nm) reveals a fast phase (less than 0.04 s), yielding an intermediate possessing approximately 70% of the equilibrium helix content. A subsequent slow phase is first order [k-1 (20 degrees C) = 1.67 s, Ea = 12.7 kcal.mol-1 (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ)], so dimerization is fast. The same rate constant characterizes folding in the Cys-190 crosslinked chains, so the intermediate has parallel and nearly registered chains. The tyrosine spectral region (280 nm) reveals only a fast phase, so these six chain sites are native in the intermediate.\r"

We previously reported that in Mycoplasma capricolum, a relative of Gram-positive eubacteria, codon CGG did not appear in coding frames, including termination sites, and tRNA(ArgCCG) pairing with codon CGG, was not detected. These facts suggest that CGG is a nonsense (unassigned and untranslatable) codon--i.e., not assigned to arginine or to any other amino acid. We have investigated whether CGG is really an unassigned codon by using a cell-free translation system prepared from M. capricolum. Translation of synthetic mRNA containing in-frame CGG codons does not result in \"read-through\" to codons beyond the CGG codons--i.e., translation ceases just before CGG. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation profiles of the reaction mixture have shown that the bulk of peptide that has been synthesized is attached to 70S ribosomes and is released upon further incubation with puromycin. The result suggests that the peptide is in the P site of ribosome in the form of peptidyl-tRNA, leaving the A site empty. When in-frame CGG codons are replaced by UAA codons in mRNA, no read-through occurs beyond UAA, just as in the case of CGG. However, the synthesized peptide is released from 70S ribosomes, presumably by release factor 1. These data suggest strongly that CGG is an unassigned codon and differs from UAA in that CGG is not used for termination.\r"

  ".W": "In rat peritoneal mast cells, the activation of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate GTP[gamma S] has been found to induce a transient rise in intracellular calcium as well as degranulation. A G protein that couples to phospholipase C (Gp) is thought to mediate the calcium response, whereas degranulation is mediated by a different G protein, termed Ge. In an attempt to activate mast-cell G proteins more selectively, the GTP analogues guanosine 5'-[alpha-thio]triphosphate (GTP[alpha S]) and guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]triphosphate (GTP[beta S]) (RP and SP diastereomers) were introduced into mast cells by means of patch pipettes. Degranulation and free intracellular calcium were monitored by cell capacitance and fura-2 measurements, respectively. It was found that RP-GTP[alpha S], like GTP[gamma S], induced both calcium release and exocytosis. In contrast, RP-GTP[beta S] induced repetitive calcium spikes that were not regularly accompanied by exocytosis. These results suggest that RP-GTP[beta S] selectively activates calcium signaling in mast cells. The RP-GTP[beta S]-induced oscillations were independent of extracellular calcium. They were absent in the presence of heparin or high concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and modulated by compound 48/80, suggesting the involvement of the inositol phospholipid signaling pathway. Latency of appearance and spiking frequency were markedly modulated by varying the intracellular ATP concentration. The differential activation of intracellular calcium signaling and exocytosis by GTP[beta S] confirms the presence of independent signal-transduction pathways for the two cell responses. RP-GTP[beta S] may prove helpful in the biochemical and molecular characterization of Gp, the as-yet-unidentified G protein that couples receptors to intracellular calcium release.\r"

RNA blot analysis indicates that the corresponding mRNA is approximately 1300 nucleotides in length. Human fibrillarin expressed in vitro migrates on SDS gels as a 36-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antisera from humans with scleroderma autoimmune disease. Human fibrillarin contains an amino-terminal repetitive domain approximately 75-80 amino acids in length that is rich in glycine and arginine residues and is similar to amino-terminal domains in the yeast and Xenopus fibrillarins. The occurrence of a putative RNA-binding domain and an RNP consensus sequence within the protein is consistent with the association of fibrillarin with small nucleolar RNAs. Protein sequence alignments show that 67% of amino acids from human fibrillarin are identical to those in yeast fibrillarin and that 81% are identical to those in Xenopus fibrillarin. This identity suggests the evolutionary conservation of an important function early in the pathway for ribosome biosynthesis.\r"

The reporter gene is a yeast HIS3 gene interrupted by an artificial intron (AI) in the antisense orientation. The HIS3AI sequences were inserted into a Ty1 element such that the intron is on the sense strand of the Ty1 element; therefore, splicing and retrotransposition of marked Ty1 transcripts can give rise to His+ cells. Fusion of the Ty1-H3mHIS3AI element to the inducible GAL1 promoter resulted in a high frequency of histidine prototrophs upon galactose induction. Moreover, spontaneous His+ revertants derived from strains containing genomic TymHIS3AI elements are a result of retrotransposition. By using this assay, we estimated the Ty1 transposition rate to be between 3 x 10(-7) and 1 x 10(-5) transpositions per Ty1 element per generation. Variations in the transposition rate of individual Ty1 elements are correlated with the relative abundance of their transcripts.\r"

By analogy to other human retroviruses this region was selected as the most likely candidate to encode the viral transactivator. Results presented here confirmed this and showed further that a deletion introduced only into the bel 1 open reading frame of a plasmid derived from an infectious molecular clone of HFV abolished transactivation. In contrast, deletions in bel 2 and bel 3 had only minor effects on the ability to transactivate. The role of the bel 1 genomic region as a transactivator was further investigated by eukaryotic expression of a genome fragment of HFV spanning the bel 1 open reading frame. A construct expressing bel 1 under control of a heterologous promoter was found to transactivate the HFV long terminal repeat in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, it is shown that the U3 region of the HFV long terminal repeat is sufficient to respond to the HFV transactivator.\r"

  ".U": "91126111\r", 
  ".W": "Free radical derivatives of peroxides, hydroperoxides, and anthrones are thought to mediate tumor promotion by these compounds. Further, the promoting activity of phorbol esters is attributed, in part, to their ability to stimulate the cellular generation of oxygen radicals. A hydroperoxide metabolite of butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroperoxyl-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (BHTOOH), has previously been shown to be a tumor promoter in mouse skin. BHTOOH is extensively metabolized by murine keratinocytes to several radical species. The primary radical generated from BHTOOH is a phenoxyl radical that can disproportionate to form butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide, a reactive electrophile. Since electrophilic species have not been previously postulated to mediate tumor promotion, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of this electrophile in the promoting activity of BHTOOH. The biological activities of two chemical analogs of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH, were compared with that of the parent compound. 4-Trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH have a reduced ability or inability, respectively, to form a quinone methide; however, like the parent compound, they both generate a phenoxyl radical when incubated with keratinocyte cytosol. The potency of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH, and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH as inducers of ornithine decarboxylase, a marker of tumor promotion, was commensurate with their capacity for generating butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide. These initial results were confirmed in a two-stage tumor promotion protocol in female SENCAR mice. Together, these data indicate that a quinone methide is mediating tumor promotion by BHTOOH, providing direct evidence that an electrophilic intermediate can elicit this stage of carcinogenesis.\r"

Expression of the receptor mRNAs in tissues of the transgenic mice was analyzed by using RNA blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction. The human gene is expressed in many tissues of the transgenic mice just as in tissues of humans. The transgenic mice are susceptible to all three poliovirus serotypes, and the mice inoculated with poliovirus show clinical symptoms similar to those observed in humans and monkeys. Rabbit antipoliovirus serum detects the antigens mainly in motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and in nerve cells in the medulla oblongata and pons of the paralyzed transgenic mice. Therefore, cell types sensitive to poliovirus in the central nervous system of the transgenic mice appear to be identical to those of humans and monkeys. Furthermore, many more doses of oral poliovirus vaccine strains than of the virulent strains are required to cause paralysis in the transgenic mice. This may reflect the observation that the virulent strain multiplies more efficiently in the central nervous system than the attenuated strain. Thus, the transgenic mice may become an excellent new animal model to study molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of poliovirus and to assess oral poliovirus vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Strains of most Salmonella serovars produce either one (monophasic) or two (diphasic) antigenic forms of flagellin protein, but strains capable of expressing three or more serologically distinct flagellins (\"complex\" serovars) have occasionally been reported. A molecular genetic analysis of a triphasic strain of the normally diphasic serovar Salmonella rubislaw revealed that it has three flagellin genes, including the normal fliC (phase 1) and fljB (phase 2) chromosomal genes encoding type r and type e,n,x flagellins, respectively, and a third locus (herein designated as flpA) that is located on a large plasmid (pRKS01) and codes for a type d flagellin. The coding sequence of the plasmid-borne gene is similar to that of a phase 1 chromosomal gene, but the sequence of its promoter region is homologous to that of a phase 2 chromosomal gene. The irreversible loss of the ability to express a type d flagellin that occurs when the triphasic strain is grown in the presence of d antiserum is caused by deletion of part or all of the flpA gene. Thus, the molecular basis for the unusual serological reactions of the triphasic strain of S. rubislaw and, by inference, other complex serovars of Salmonella is explained. Plasmids of the type carried by the triphasic strain of S. rubislaw provide a mechanism for the generation of new serovars through the lateral transfer and recombination of flagellin genes.\r"

The recombinant proteins were tested in cultures of dissociated fetal rat brain cells containing basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. rhBDNF stimulated the differentiation of the cholinergic neurons, similar to NGF, which is well established as a neurotrophic factor for these cells. However, rhBDNF was particularly effective during the first few days in vitro, whereas the stimulatory action of rhNGF was more pronounced later in the development of the cultures. This finding indicates the existence of different time periods of responsiveness of the cholinergic neurons to BDNF and NGF. To assess the selectivity of the effect of rhBDNF on cholinergic neurons, its actions were tested in cultures of ventral mesencephalon containing dopaminergic cells. In contrast to NGF, which does not affect central dopaminergic neurons, rhBDNF increased dopamine uptake activity. The findings suggest that BDNF stimulates survival or differentiation of other cells besides the cholinergic neurons.\r"

Overlapping cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. The encoded open reading frame of about 105 kDa contained at its N-terminal half all six tryptic peptide sequences, suggesting that the 51-kDa NF-kappa B protein is processed from a 105-kDa precursor. An in vitro synthesized protein containing most of the N-terminal half of the open reading frame bound specifically to an NF-kappa B binding site. This region also showed high homology to a domain shared by the Drosophila dorsal gene and the avian and mammalian rel (proto)oncogene products. The level of the 3.8-kilobase mRNA was strongly increased after stimulation with TNF alpha or phorbol ester. Thus, both factors not only activate NF-kappa B protein, as described previously, but also induce expression of the gene encoding the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B.\r"

These enzymes have been organized into two classes which are defined by sequence motifs that are associated with specific three-dimensional structures. We isolated, cloned, and sequenced the previously uncharacterized gene for E. coli cysteine-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.16) and showed that it encodes a protein of 461 amino acids. Biochemical analysis established that the protein is a monomer, thus establishing this enzyme as the smallest known monomeric synthetase. The sequence shows that cysteine-tRNA synthetase is a class I enzyme that is most closely related to a subgroup that includes the much larger methionine-, isoleucine-, leucine-, and valine-tRNA synthetases, which range in size from 677 to 951 amino acids. The amino-terminal 293 amino acids of the cysteine enzyme can be modeled as a nucleotide-binding fold that is more compact than that of its closest relatives by virtue of truncations of two insertions that split the fold. This smaller nucleotide-binding fold accounts for much of the reduced size of the cysteine enzyme and establishes the limit to which the structure of this domain is contracted in the five members of this subgroup of class I enzymes.\r"

Immunoblots using antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 revealed cross-reactive proteins in the plasma membrane fraction only. In contrast, two monoclonal antibodies against band 3 membrane domain labeled a 45-kDa protein; further immunoblotting and immunogold studies of membrane fractions and kidney sections using one of the anti-membrane domain antibodies showed that labeling was strongest in mitochondria of H(+)-secreting collecting duct cells. Tissue-to-tissue expression of the 45-kDa mitochondrial protein was variable: kidney medulla greater than heart greater than kidney cortex much greater than liver. We conclude that a 45-kDa protein with immunological cross-reactivity to the erythrocyte band 3 membrane domain is expressed in mitochondria in a highly cell-specific fashion and speculate that the protein may play a role in mitochondrial anion transport.\r"

U1 cells constitutively express low levels of virus, which can be increased by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and other inducers. GSH, GSE, and NAC suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion the induction of HIV expression mediated by PMA, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, in the absence of cytotoxic or cytostatic effects. Reverse transcriptase activity, inducible by PMA, TNF-alpha, or IL-6, was decreased by 80-90% after pretreatment with GSH, GSE, or NAC. The induction of total HIV protein synthesis was also decreased appreciably after pretreatment with GSH, GSE, or NAC. The accumulation of HIV mRNA was substantially suppressed after pretreatment with NAC but to a lesser extent after pretreatment with GSH or GSE. Although PMA induces the expression of TNF-alpha in U1 cells, the suppressive effect of GSH, GSE, and NAC on PMA-induced HIV expression in U1 cells was not associated with the inhibition of TNF-alpha expression. The present findings, which elucidate relationships between cellular GSH and HIV expression, suggest that therapy with thiols may be of value in the treatment of HIV infection.\r"

Until very recently, x-ray crystallographic or NMR three-dimensional structure analyses of DNA-binding zinc proteins have not been available to serve as standards of reference for the zinc binding sites of these families of proteins. Those of the DNA-binding domains of the fungal transcription factor GAL4 and the rat glucocorticoid receptor are the first to have been determined. Both proteins contain two zinc binding sites, and in both, cysteine residues are the sole zinc ligands. In GAL4, two zinc atoms are bound to six cysteine residues which form a \"zinc cluster\" akin to that of metallothionein; the distance between the two zinc atoms of GAL4 is approximately 3.5 A. In the glucocorticoid receptor, each zinc atom is bound to four cysteine residues; the interatomic zinc-zinc distance is approximately 13 A, and in this instance, a \"zinc twist\" is represented by a helical DNA recognition site located between the two zinc atoms. Zinc clusters and zinc twists are here recognized as two distinctive motifs in DNA-binding proteins containing multiple zinc atoms. For native \"zinc fingers,\" structural data do not exist as yet; consequently, the interatomic distances between zinc atoms are not known. As further structural data become available, the structural and functional significance of these different motifs in their binding to DNA and other proteins participating in the transmission of the genetic message will become apparent.\r"

Quantitative analysis shows that the difference in the permanent dipole moment between the ground state and excited states in this protein complex is substantially larger than for pure spheroidene extracted from the protein. The results demonstrate the presence of a large perturbation on the electronic structure of this nearly symmetric carotenoid due to the organized environment in the protein. This work also provides an explanation for the seemingly anomalous dependence of carotenoid band shifts on transmembrane potential and a generally useful approach for calibrating electric field-sensitive dyes that are widely used to probe potentials in biological systems.\r"

Amino-terminal variants consisted of two transmembrane molecules that contained three and two immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops, as well as a potential intracellular form of the receptor. The two intracellular juxtamembrane motifs differed in a potential serine-threonine kinase phosphorylation site. One carboxyl-terminal motif was a putative tyrosine kinase that contained potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The second carboxyl-terminal motif was probably not a tyrosine kinase and did not exhibit the same candidate carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites.\r"

After intravenous injection of an immunoglobulin G3 monoclonal antibody (NVS3) against irradiated P. vivax sporozoites, four of six monkeys were protected against sporozoite-induced malaria, and the remaining two animals took significantly longer to become parasitemic. Epitope mapping demonstrated that NVS3 recognizes only four (AGDR) of the nine amino acids within the repeat region of the P. vivax CS protein. The monkeys immunized with (DRAADGQPAG)20 did not produce antibodies to the protective epitope AGDR. Thus, determination of the fine specificity of protective immune responses may be critical to the construction of successful subunit vaccines.\r"

The biochemical properties and potential substrates of pp39mos were examined in unfertilized eggs and in transformed cells in order to study how the protein functions both as CSF and in transformation. The pp39mos protein associated with polymers under conditions that favor tubulin oligomerization and was present in an approximately 500-kilodalton \"core\" complex under conditions that favor depolymerization. beta-Tubulin was preferentially coprecipitated in pp39mos immunoprecipitates and was the major phosphorylated product in a pp39mos-dependent immune complex kinase assay. Immunofluorescence analysis of NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Xenopus c-mos showed that pp39mos colocalizes with tubulin in the spindle during metaphase and in the midbody and asters during telophase. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole affected tubulin and pp39mos organization in the same way. It therefore appears that pp39mos is a tubulin-associated protein kinase and may thus participate in the modification of microtubules and contribute to the formation of the spindle. This activity expressed during interphase in somatic cells may be responsible for the transforming activity of pp39mos.\r"

In order to evaluate its function, CFTR was expressed in HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, and anion permeability was assessed with a fluorescence microscopic assay and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) increased anion permeability and chloride currents in cells expressing CFTR, but not in cells expressing a mutant CFTR (delta F508) or in nontransfected cells. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that CFTR is itself a cAMP-activated chloride channel. The alternative interpretation, that CFTR directly or indirectly regulates chloride channels, requires that these cells have endogenous cryptic, chloride channels that are stimulated by cAMP only in the presence of CFTR.\r"

A highly consistent cross-sectional pattern was observed in all specimens. The lower sacral (S2-S5) and coccygeal roots were located in the dorsal aspect of the thecal sac, whereas the lumbar and first sacral roots exhibited an oblique, layered pattern as they ascended. The motor bundle was situated anteromedial to its respective sensory bundle within each layer, Invaginations of arachnoid held the nerve roots in a fixed relationship to one another.

The motor bundles are directly ventral to the sensory fibers within individual roots extrathecally. Dorsal root ganglia size varies with vertebral level. The majority of ganglia lie directly beneath the vertebral pedicles and one third overlie a portion of the lateral intervertebral disc.

Degradation of proteoglycan and collagen of rabbit annulus was observed when there was narrowing of the neural foremen and the degradation process was accelerated by vibration. Vibration alone, in the absence of structural abnormalities of the spinal motion segment, did not induce matrix degradation probably because of a less pronounced stimulation of the dorsal root ganglia. Biological events similar to those postulated here, fomented by a combination of structural abnormalities and environmental factors, could be involved in human disc degeneration.\r"

A device for measuring sitting height is described (SD, 1.4 mm for repeated measures). The mean change in body height (diurnal reduction) during two normal days in five men aged 23 to 25 years was 10.6 mm, (SD, 3.2 mm). On the third day, the change in sitting height was measured before and after vertical vibration (5 Hz with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 3 mm, and peak acceleration less than 2 m/s2) and again at the end of the day. The mean reduction in sitting height over the half hour of vibration exposure was 9.0 mm versus less than 1 mm for the control condition. The mean height loss over the third day (the day of 30 minutes of vibration exposure) was only 3.6 mm (compared with 10.6 mm lost over a control day with no vibration exposure). Hence, exposure to vibration increased the creep response in all subjects during exposure but, at the end of the day, there was a recovery in height, such that subjects were taller at the end of the day of vibration exposure. It is hypothesized that this \"rebound\" effect is due to an inflammatory response in the spine.\r"

The duration of follow-up ranged from 5 to 25 years, averaging 14 years. Sixty percent were women and 40% were men, their ages ranging from 25-73 years. Antecedent motor vehicle injury had occurred in 49 cases and work injury to the spine in 23. Sixty-four percent had no history of prior back injury. It was found that over 31% had undergone lumbar disc surgery, and a high number of patients demonstrated abnormal lumbar radiographs or myelograms, including 78 with bulging discs, 100 with major root defects, 78 with minor root defects, 8 with spinal stenosis, and 7 with spondylolisthesis. Myelograms were normal in 22 cases. The sites of lumbar abnormalities included L4-5 (110), L5-S1 (90), and multilevel (8). There was a higher incidence of lumbar disc abnormalities associated with multilevel cervical spondylosis. There also was a relationship between residual symptoms and myelographic abnormalities. Two studies in the authors' institution suggest an autoimmune basis for the frequent coexistence of cervical and lumbar disc disease, namely the demonstration of antigenic properties in the nucleus pulposus and high serum immunoglobulins.\r"

All patients underwent spinal decompression; in 11 this was combined with an anterior fusion using autogenous tricortical iliac grafts. All patients have recovered and are ambulatory, and no patient's disorder was made worse by surgery. Twenty-three separate organisms were cultured, only five of which were Staphylococcus. The antibiotic courses were shorter and pain relief more rapid with anterior fusion. All anterior bone grafts incorporated rapidly, and there was no progression of kyphosis or sequestration of grafts, regardless of organisms or level. The rational treatment of adult spinal sepsis necessitates the securing of tissue from the spine for histologic and bacteriologic examination. Pain relief, stabilization, and neural decompression can best be achieved with anterior decompression and fusion. Autogenous iliac crest grafts incorporate in the presence of sepsis.\r"

The radiologic and histologic characteristics of osteoblastoma of the spine are indistinguishable from those arising in other sites. The typical lesion exhibited a well-defined, geographic margin with a sclerotic, frequently lobulated border. Approximately one half of the cases were predominantly lucent, the remainder displaying varying degrees of matrix mineralization. Distribution of the osteoblastomas through the spinal axis was as follows: cervical-29, thoracic-16, lumbar-17, sacral-13. Other significant findings included posterior element involvement in 73 of 75 cases, and a striking male to female ratio of 2.5 to 1.\r"

Seventeen patients with trisomy 18 were evaluated to study the development of scoliosis associated with this disorder. There were 13 females and 4 males with ages ranging from birth to 22 years. Twelve patients died by age 2. None developed scoliosis or had vertebral anomalies. The five patients who survived beyond age 2 developed scoliosis. Curve progression was demonstrated in the patients who returned for follow-up. Bracing was not well tolerated in two patients with curves of 48 degrees and 58 degrees. Both had poor motor control and sitting ability. One patient with a 30 degree curve was successfully managed by bracing. Another patient with a severe scoliosis was successfully fused with anterior and posterior instrumentation. Patients with trisomy 18 should be carefully evaluated for scoliosis. Scoliosis in the older child, surviving beyond age 2, may be progressive and difficult to manage.\r"

To address these problems, numerical [corrected] analysis was developed to provide estimates for the maximum bending stresses, approximately equal to maximum tensile stresses, in L-rods subject to various axial loads and postoperative Cobb angles. The superior load capacity of L-rods made from MP35N multiphase alloy compared with 316L stainless steel was demonstrated. Bending stresses in excess of the fatigue limit were predicted for eight patients with broken rods, suggesting that such failures might be prevented by prior analysis. This analytic approach provides a foundation for future studies of custom-designed L-rods and perhaps the successful use of L-rods without arthrodesis.\r"

There were 191 structural curves in the 139 patients. One hundred fifteen patients (83%) showed improvement or less than 5 degree change in curvature. Twenty-four patients (17%) demonstrated an increase in curvature greater than 5 degrees. Based on these preliminary results, continued use of bending brace treatment at nighttime only is justified for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Patients with double curves should be observed closely for increase in compensatory curves.\r"

In the sagittal plane, segmental instability can be characterized during lumbar motion from full extension to full flexion. The authors studied this movement using a translational method for the kinematic analysis, implementing a new concept known as the instability factor. Both translational and angular components of motion are evaluated. By computing the incremental motion parameters at different stages of spinal bending, the total amount of translation and angulation is obtained and combined in a ratio termed the instability factor. This factor increases with linear instability and decreases with rotational instability. The authors reviewed 12 control subjects and 36 patients with chronic low-back pain. The diagnoses of patients were categorized into three groups: idiopathic low-back pain, lumbar disc prolapse, and degenerative disc disease. Lateral radiographs of each subject's spine at the L4-5 level were obtained using low dose radiography and were performed serially as the subjects moved from full extension to full flexion. It was found that the group of patients with degenerative disc disease had an average age-corrected instability factor of 37.3 (mm/radian), which was significantly larger than that of normal subjects 25.5 (mm/radian), (P = 0.0065). No significant difference was seen in the instability factor of patients with idiopathic low-back pain or lumbar disc prolapse.\r"

The effectiveness of the two intervention programs was evaluated over a 1-year period. Baseline preintervention data and evaluation at the end of 3 months of intervention and after an additional 6 months were collected. A monthly surveillance for the whole year showed a mean of 4.5 \"painful months\" in the CAL group versus 7.3 and 7.4 months in the back school and control groups, respectively (P less than 0.0001). The superiority of the CAL group was achieved partly because of the significant increase in trunk forward flexion and to initial increment in abdominal muscle strength. The increased trunk flexion was associated with the rate of participation in the CAL sessions. Further research is needed to answer the question of \"intensity versus type of exercise\" by comparing different intervention programs, with similar intensity.\r"

While the primary emphasis of this treatment approach has remained unchanged since its inception over 6 years ago, recent rapid advances in quantification technology and understanding of the complexity of the chronic low-back pain (CLBP) syndrome have led to more sophisticated and aggressive rehabilitation efforts. In the current study, the authors examined two groups of patients with CLBP, from the treatment program's initial (n = 45) and most recent years (n = 57) of operation, respectively, to determine if the evolution of the treatment program has resulted in increased gains in physical capacity between these groups of patients. Patients in each group were assessed on measures of isokinetic trunk strength and spinal range of motion at program admission and discharge. Both groups demonstrated improved physical capacity levels, but the recent group also demonstrated considerably higher physical capacity levels than the early group, at both program admission and discharge. It was concluded that functional restoration continues to be successful with CLBP patients, and that increased preprogram training and education may facilitate a more rapid elimination of inhibitory factors (ie, pain, fear of reinjury), which often impede and slow physical training.\r"

  ".W": "A work tolerance program was used for rehabilitation treatment of 45 patients with spinal dysfunction. Patients entering the treatment group were prospectively evaluated by objective physical capacity assessment (PCA). Treatment patients averaged 4 weeks of three, one half day sessions per week. These patients were compared with a control group of 33 patients who did not participate in the rehabilitation program but were evaluated by PCA. A telephone review of all patients in each group was carried out at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Results demonstrated that 78% of the rehabilitation treatment group were discharged with an improved functional work capacity. Most importantly, at 6-month follow-up, 73.0% of patients in the treatment group were productively working while only 38% of control group patients were actively employed. In addition, 84.4% showed an improvement in spinal range of motion. The subjective pain scale ratings of these treatment patients demonstrated only 44.4% decreased pain, while 51.1% stayed the same, and two patients increased discomfort. Further medical diagnostics or intervention was required in 24.4% of treatment patients. These findings definitely show that a spinal rehabilitation work-tolerance program based on objective measurement will enhance an increased rate of return to productive employment activity. There is poor correlation of subjective pain assessment when compared to objective PCAs. Therefore, recommendations of patients for return-to-productive work should be based pain ratings. When adjusted for nonselection patients, the authors community-based hospital program showed similar results to other programs. The work tolerance and rehabilitation program in Concord, New Hampshire, demonstrated a significant cost-effective approach; being less expensive, less time-consuming, and less psychologically oriented.\r"

The women in this group were older and had lower pain indices than women who underwent operation. Conservatively treated patients with negative rhizography had more severe occupational handicaps, minor expectations of possible surgery, physically more strenuous jobs requiring difficult physical positions, and lower indices for pain and ADL than did the operated patients.

The NOPs were divided into two groups: 30 patients with pathologic rhizography (PR) and 80 patients with negative rhizography (NR). Pain-, ADL-, and occupation-handicap indices showed that after the 1 year follow-up the OP group had the best result and the NR group the lowest result. The PR group had nearly as good a result as the OP group. Thus, sciatica patients are candidates for conservative therapy, even though they have pathologic findings in rhizography, if the symptoms are mild. To improve therapeutic outcome, more accurate diagnostic tools are needed to develop specific therapy especially for those sciatica patients with negative rhizography.\r"

Most patients profited by the operation, and solid fusion was achieved in almost all cases. The posterolateral spondylolysis performed using graft from the iliac crest, the interbody fusion technique, or their combination turned out to be the most reliable surgical methods.

The age range was 30-80 years. Mean age was 51 years. Follow-up was 1-4 years. Twenty patients underwent decompression and fusion for spinal stenosis, nine underwent spinal arthrodesis for instability, six underwent the same for spondylolisthesis, and five underwent fusions for other diagnoses. A posterior midline approach was used. Laminal hook sites were prepared, and care was taken to prevent dural compression or tenting. Balanced distraction was done to restore soft tissue tension and stability. No attempt was made to reduce deformity. A posterior and lateral mass fusion augmented with allograft bone was performed on all but three patients, in whom autogenous bone was used. The majority of patients were placed in a custom-molded lumbosacral orthosis for 3-6 months after operation. There were no neurologic complications, dural tears, or pseudomeningoceles. The first sacral laminas were instrumented in 22 patients. Nine of the 40 patients underwent rod removal. Reasons for removal were pain due to loosening in five patients and failure of fusion in two. On rod removal in two patients, no abnormality was found. Insertion within the sacral laminas did not lead to neurologic complications. The major problem appeared to be loosening, which necessitated rod removal in 12% of the patients. Knodt rod distraction instrumentation is a safe and effective method of internal fixation for lumbosacral fusions.\r"

  ".W": "Groin dissection was performed in 158 patients with malignant melanoma (superficial dissection, 76 patients; radical dissection, 82 patients). Of 63 patients with palpable nodes, 57 patients (90%) had histologic involvement. Of 93 patients with nonpalpable nodes, 31 patients (33%) had histologically positive nodes. The 5-year survival rate for patients with histologically negative nodes (n = 69) was 77%; the 5-year survival rate for patients with histologically positive nodes (n = 89) was 43%. The respective 5-year disease-free survival rates were 72% and 34%. Of 57 patients with palpable, positive inguinal nodes, 21 patients (37%) had involvement of the deep nodes. Of 31 patients with nonpalpable, histologic involvement of the inguinal nodes, six patients (19%) had or developed involvement of the deep nodes. One of two patients with uncertain clinical status of the nodes preoperatively had positive deep nodes. In prophylactic node dissection, frozen section of the inguinal group of the nodes does not provide a reliable method, because of sampling errors, in determining microscopic involvement of the nodes and in deciding whether a superficial or radical groin dissection is to be done. For patients with positive nodes the 5-year survival rate was 48% when only the inguinal group was involved and was 28% when both inguinal and deep nodes were involved; the respective 5-year disease-free survival rates were 39% and 20%. Survival after therapeutic groin dissection may partly depend on the thoroughness of the procedure. Patients who have positive, deep nodes and who are undergoing an incontinuity dissection of the inguinal, iliac, and obturator nodes have an appreciable 5-year survival rate.\r"

  ".W": "Melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland diagnosed before death was exceedingly rare before the development of computed tomographic (CT) scanning. The records of 28 patients with melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland seen since 1975 were reviewed. Eighteen patients were men and 10 were women. Twenty-three patients had unilateral disease. Four patients were diagnosed only at autopsy, leaving 24 for analysis of treatment and survival. Twenty-one patients had received specific active immunotherapy, four had received chemotherapy (dacarbazine, lomustin, bleomycin, and vincristine), and three had received both before the diagnosis of their adrenal disease. Adrenal metastases were diagnosed by CT scanning in 14 patients with symptoms, 10 (91%) of whom had pain. Ten patients were diagnosed by CT before entry into a chemotherapy protocol. Of eight patients who underwent resection of all known disease, five underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, two underwent unilateral adrenalectomy and bowel resection, and one underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Two patients underwent partial resection of large unilateral tumors. Fourteen patients with adrenal metastases and disease elsewhere were initiated or continued with chemotherapy or were treated symptomatically. Mean survival in the group that underwent resection for cure was 59 months (3 to 112 months), whereas survival in the group with unresectable tumors was 15 months (1.5 to 132 months). Four of eight patients who underwent resection for cure lived more than 5 years after detection of adrenal metastasis, whereas in only one of 14 patients with unresectable tumors was the same true. Patients with metastatic melanoma localized to one or both adrenal glands may benefit from early detection and surgical intervention.\r"

The CT findings regarding neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs and metastasis or enlarged lymph nodes were compared with the findings at laparotomy (85 cases) or autopsy (5 cases), thus permitting evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of CT and its usefulness for predicting resectability. When present, neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs was overestimated or underestimated by CT in 21 cases. Invasion of adjacent organs according to CT was false positive in 17 cases and false negative in 11 cases. When liver metastasis or enlarged regional or distant lymph nodes were present, CT overestimated or underestimated their extent in 17 cases, and the diagnosis was false positive in one case and false negative in 33 cases. The positive and negative predictive values of CT concerning resectability of the tumor were 81% and 64%, respectively. Routine preoperative CT in gastric malignancy is concluded to be of limited value and surgical exploration, when feasible, remains the method of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Of 1070 patients with gastric cancers, 292 patients underwent total gastrectomy during 13 years. Sixty patients were more than 70 years of age and 232 were under 69 years. The incidence of well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas was the same in the elderly patients, whereas the latter was dominant in the young patients. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding location, size, macroscopic patterns, extent of lymph metastases, or stage classification. The rates of preoperative surgical risk factors were significantly different between the two groups (p less than 0.01): 90.0% for the elderly and 34.9% for the young patients. However, the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality were 31.7% and 3.3% for the elderly and 24.1% and 1.3% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. The 5- and 10-year survival rates after curative total gastrectomy were 48.6% and 23.2% for the elderly compared with 49.4% and 33.6% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. A 5-year survival rate after noncurative operation was 0% for the elderly and 6.4% for the young patients. These results indicate that, when performed for cure, total gastrectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy can provide good long-term results for elderly, as well as young, patients.\r"

Resection of the aneurysm and arterial reconstruction were performed without the use of prosthetic material or vein graft. Pathologic examination showed no evidence of inflammation or medial degeneration in any of the layers of the arterial wall. This is the fourth report found in the literature of documented idiopathic abdominal aneurysm in a child. The conditions associated with abdominal aneurysms in childhood are discussed, and the literature is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that prostacyclin could be a systemic hormone and could mediate the splanchnic hyperemia of chronic portal hypertension was evaluated in rabbits in a normotensive state and in rabbits with chronic partial ligation of the portal vein. In rabbits with portal hypertension (PHT), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha, a prostacyclin degradation product) was elevated twofold in all vascular beds (systemic arterial, systemic venous, and portal venous) when compared with levels in control animals. In PHT rabbits, exogenous prostacyclin infusion after cyclooxygenase blockade through the systemic arterial, systemic venous, or portal venous route resulted in an equal elevation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the reciprocal vascular beds and restored the original precyclooxygenase blockade hemodynamics. These hemodynamic changes were of equal magnitude irrespective of site of infusion in PHT. In controls there was no significant change in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or hemodynamics with intraportal infusion. We conclude that prostacyclin achieves systemic levels by escaping hepatic degradation resulting from portosystemic shunting in the animal with chronic portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the interaction of endotoxemia and ischemic organ injury was investigated in a rat model. Animals received lipopolysaccharide to induce endotoxemia and were simultaneously subjected to renal ischemia. If only renal ischemia was induced, moderate azotemia occurred and all animals survived. Lipopolysaccharide treatment caused neither renal failure nor death. However, rats with both endotoxemia and renal ischemia showed severe azotemia, and 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. The observed mortality rate is unlikely related to renal failure since animals subjected to bilateral nephrectomy did not die within 48 hours after treatment with lipopolysaccharide. To further exclude the role of renal failure in the enhanced effect of endotoxemia, experiments were performed in which ischemic kidneys were excised from littermates and were placed in the abdomens of lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. A similar effect was observed: 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. Azotemia did not occur. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine involved in endotoxemia-induced morbidity and death, we studied the role of TNF in our model. Plasma levels of TNF were increased during endotoxemia. Concomitant renal ischemic injury did not influence the concentration of TNF. When animals were treated with recombinant TNF and were subsequently subjected to renal ischemic injury, again a 50% mortality was observed, a rate similar to that in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. We conclude that the sensitivity to endotoxemia is enhanced by tissue necrosis and may lead to death in the experimental model used in this study.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated the solid state laser as a means of determining testicular blood flow at operation. A solid state laser was used to measure blood flow before mobilization of cryptorchid testes, and subsequently after mobilization and placement within a subcutaneous scrotal pouch. Testicular volume was calculated. The median blood flow (ml/100 gm/min) before mobilization was 8.96 (range, 3.43 to 27.2). After mobilization a modest rise to 9.39 (range, 1.82 to 23.75) occurred, which was not statistically significant. However, heterogeneity existed in the response; 11 testes showed a median fall of 8.07 (range, 1.59 to 15.36), which was significant compared to the initial value; 16 testes showed a variable degree of hyperemia with a rise of 2.57 (range, 0.1 to 12.7), which was also significant compared to the initial value; two testes showed no change. The testes that showed a fall in blood flow were all high abdominal testes, which required the most mobilization. The mean testicular volume was 0.38 cc (SEM, 0.03 cc). No difference was noted in size between testes with a net rise in blood flow (mean volume, 0.38 cc) and testes with a net fall in blood flow (mean volume, 0.375 cc). No relationship was noted between testicular size and blood flow. We conclude that the solid state laser is a simple means of measuring testicular blood flow at orchiopexy and may provide a method of deciding which testes should undergo microvascular replantation on the basis of inadequate perfusion per-operatively.\r"

  ".W": "Laser ablation of veins after injection of wavelength-specific dyes to enhance and localize energy absorption could provide a useful adjunct to current treatment options. To enhance the absorption of diode laser energy at 808 nm, ear veins of 41 rabbits were infused with 2 to 3 ml of indocyanine green dye (maximum absorption, 805 nm) and exposed for 2 to 20 seconds. Animals were killed between 0 and 28 days after operation. Discrete time intervals of laser exposure exist during which various-sized vessels can be ablated without significant thermal injury to the overlying tissue. Small vessels (0.2 mm in diameter) blanch after 2 to 3 seconds of exposure, whereas medium-sized vessels (2 mm in diameter) require 8 to 10 seconds. Vessels can be ablated with a power density as low as 11.1 W/cm2. Specimens taken immediately after laser exposure show vessel wall thinning and a reirradiation effect, created as laser energy initially absorbed by dye is reemitted. By the seventh day after operation, a brisk inflammatory response and acanthosis of the overlying epidermal layer develop. The lumen is partially filled by thrombus with cellular invasion. By postoperative day 28, the epidermal thickening and inflammatory reaction have resolved; the vessel walls are fibrotic. The use of low-power, air-cooled diode lasers, in conjunction with wavelength-specific dyes, may provide a simple, viable, and cosmetically appealing alternative to the treatment of superficial varicosities of the extremities.\r"
