Thus, we evaluated the physiologic effects of 30, 60, and 180 minutes of global ischemia in an isolated, isovolumic rabbit heart model, at 3 different ages: newborns (less than 1 week of age) (n = 36), juveniles (4 to 6 weeks old) (n = 36), and adults (5 to 7 months old) (n = 36). Following 30 and 60 minutes of ischemia, respectively, adults recovered 87 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) and 90 +/- 7% of baseline systolic function, and juveniles recovered 91 +/- 10% and 85 +/- 8%. In contrast, newborns recovered only 27 +/- 6% and 28 +/- 4% of baseline systolic function (p less than 0.05 compared to adults and juveniles). During ischemia, newborn hearts became stiff more rapidly, reaching 361 +/- 46% of baseline stiffness by 60 minutes, whereas adults and juveniles were at 122 +/- 33% and 92 +/- 18% of baseline stiffness (p less than 0.05 newborns compared to adults and juveniles). With reperfusion after 60 minutes of ischemia, the work efficiency of the newborn heart deteriorated to 39 +/- 7% of baseline, compared with 95 +/- 7% and 91 +/- 7% of baseline efficiency in the adult and juvenile hearts (p less than 0.05, newborns compared to adults and juveniles). The ratio of tissue wet-to-dry weights were similar in all age groups after ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to determine if voltage-sensitive calcium channels are present in bovine aortic endothelial cell plasmalemma and if they contribute to the rise in cytosolic calcium produced by bradykinin. After bradykinin (100 nM) exposure, endothelial cell associated fura-2 fluorescence peaked within 10-20 seconds and then declined to a steady level 2- to 3-fold above resting values. Pretreatment with lanthanum (20 microM) abolished the steady level produced by bradykinin but had little effect on the initial, transient rise in cytosolic calcium. Chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA before addition of bradykinin resulted in a substantial decrease in the fura-2 transient and elimination of the long-lasting component. Nimodipine (3 microM) and nitrendipine (1 microM) were without effect on either phase of the bradykinin-induced response. Moreover, elevation of extracellular potassium failed to produce a rise in intracellular calcium. With the use of the tight seal technique to voltage clamp the cells, inwardly rectifying and calcium-activated potassium currents were found to exist in the endothelial cells. Addition of bradykinin (100 nM) elicited a calcium-activated potassium current that was eliminated in the absence of intracellular potassium. No voltage-sensitive calcium currents were activated when the cells were exposed to 10 mM or 110 mM calcium chloride in the presence or absence of bradykinin. The binding of [3H](+)PN200-110 to endothelial cell membrane preparations was 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed in PC-12, GH3, or BC3H1 cell membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One week later, half of the animals were subjected to a moderate swimming exercise and the other half remained sedentary. Thus, four experimental groups, each consisting of 14 rats, were formed: control animals that were exercised or kept sedentary and corresponding renal hypertensive animals either exercised or sedentary. In hypertensive rats, a significantly increased left ventricular weight and reduced coronary reserve were found. Cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive rats was characterized by a lower number of capillaries on a tissue cross-section, larger heterogeneity of the capillary net, and a less uniform orientation of capillaries in space. Total length of capillaries in the hypertrophic hearts increased significantly, but less than the increase in cardiac weight, resulting in reduced capillary length density. Chronic swimming for 2 hr/day for a period of 6 weeks, subsequent to a 4-week acclimation period, did not significantly influence any of the investigated indexes of capillaries from hypertrophic hearts. In the normotensive rats, chronic swimming resulted only in a moderate increase in total capillary length associated with a small increase in the left ventricular weight of similar degree. Thus, chronic exercise in normotensive rats induced a moderate increase in total capillary length per left ventricle, while it did not alleviate impaired capillarization of hypertrophic hearts from hypertensive rats.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to contrast the effects of static and pulsatile pressure on carotid baroreceptor activity over a wide range of mean arterial pressure. Static and pulsatile pressure were applied to the isolated carotid sinus of dogs anesthetized with chloralose. Recordings were obtained from single baroreceptor units as well as from the whole sinus nerve or a large strand of the nerve. Three observations are reported. First, in single units the pulsatile pressure threshold, which averaged 48 +/- 8 (SEM) mm Hg, was far below the static pressure threshold, which averaged 79 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05, n = 15). Thus, pulsatility decreased the threshold by an average of 31 mm Hg in contrast to the minimal or lack of decrease in threshold reported by others in aortic baroreceptors. Second, at moderate arterial pressures a shift from static to pulsatile pressure caused a decrease in single and multiple unit activities. In single units, the decrease approximated 15% (from 42.0 +/- 2.1 to 35.5 +/- 1.9 spikes/sec, p less than 0.05, n = 25). In all units, there was no diastolic nerve activity (\"silence\") when diastolic pressure was 1 to 10 mm Hg above static pressure threshold; 80% of the units exhibited \"diastolic silence\" when diastolic pressure was 20-30 mm Hg above threshold and 40% of the units showed silence at diastolic pressures 40-50 mm Hg above threshold. In whole nerve recordings, pulsatility increased activity from 57 +/- 15 to 142 +/- 29 spikes/sec (p less than 0.05) at low mean arterial pressures (50 and 75 mm Hg), as expected from the reduction in pressure threshold noted in single units, and decreased activity by approximately 15% (from 373 +/- 69 to 320 +/- 55 spikes/sec, p less than 0.05, n = 9) at mean arterial pressures of 125 and 150 mm Hg. This decrease in activity with a shift from static to pulsatile pressure at moderate arterial pressures has not been reported previously. Third, the static pressure-activity curve was sigmoid, and its gain peaked sharply at 75-100 mm Hg; in contrast, the pulsatile pressure-activity curve was linear between 25 and 150 mm Hg, and its maximum gain was half the maximum gain during static pressure. These differences between the static pressure-activity curve and the pulsatile pressure-activity curve were noted during both increases and decreases in carotid sinus pressure; both curves exhibited some hysteresis during the decreases in pressure.\r"

Both normal and stiffened leaflets were considered in the vibrational analysis. The effects of conditions that simulated degeneration, such as stiffening, central perforation, a tear, calcium deposits in the commissural attachments, and combinations of these were determined. The primary frequency of vibration of the normal leaflets was within the range of the dominant frequency of the heart sounds determined clinically by spectral analysis of the recorded phonocardiogram. If only one leaflet was stiffened or calcified, there was only a marginal change of frequency. With stiffening and calcification of the commissures of all 3 leaflets, the frequency of vibration increased. Introduction of a tear in a single leaflet of a stiffened and calcified valve markedly reduced the fundamental frequency. In view of the relation between the frequency content of heart sounds and the frequency of valve vibration, this mathematical simulation establishes a possible basis for the observation of a varying dominant frequency of heart sounds in patients with bioprosthetic valves that are in the process of degenerating.\r"

Current methods for quantifying regional stress include mathematical modelling and measurements with strain gauges. Both methods are difficult to validate. We hypothesized that transverse stiffness (i.e., the ratio of indentation stress to strain as the ventricular wall is indented in the direction perpendicular to the wall) would be proportional to the stresses in the plane of the wall and could be used to estimate the latter. To test this hypothesis, 6 arterially perfused canine ventricular septa were mounted in an apparatus that could exert biaxial load in the plane of the wall. A servo system maintained the central third of the septa isometric during active contractions while the septa were paced at 30-60 pulses/min. In the center of the isometric region, a probe of 7 mm diameter indented the septa while the transverse indentation stress and strain were measured. For values of peak systolic in-plane stress from 0.56 to 2.6 g/mm2, the transverse stiffness varied from 1.2 to 11.7 g/mm2 and was linearly related to the in-plane wall stress in each septum (p less than 0.001, ANOVA). After cardioplegia, the transverse stiffness also correlated with passively applied wall stress for each dog (p less than 0.001). The slopes of the individual relations between transverse stiffness and wall stress from active contractions were similar to those from passively applied stress (mean +/- SEM; 1.82 +/- 0.36 versus 1.45 +/- 0.31, NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Individual cells were simulated using differential equations describing transmembrane ionic currents. Intrinsic cycle lengths (periods) were adjusted by applying constant depolarizing or hyperpolarizing bias current, and cells were coupled through ohmic resistances to form two-dimensional arrays. Activation maps of 81-225 coupled cells showed an apparent wavefront conducting from a leading pacemaker region to the rest of the matrix even though the pattern actually resulted from mutual entrainment of all spontaneously beating cells. Apparent conduction time increased with increasing intercellular resistance. Appropriate selection of pacemaker cycle lengths and intercellular resistances permitted the accurate simulation of the activation sequence seen experimentally for the rabbit sinus node. Furthermore, a simulated acetylcholine pulse applied to a randomly selected 20% of the cells in this model produced a pacemaker shift that lasted several beats. These results support the hypothesis that sinus node synchronization occurs through a \"democratic\" process resulting from the phase-dependent interactions of thousands of pacemakers.\r"

In the presence of zero-extracellular-Na+, (choline chloride substitution)-nominal-zero-Ca2+ [( Ca2+] approximately 5 microM), exposure of ventricular cells to 1 mM cyanide (CN) and 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)-zero-glucose solution resulted in the development of a contracture (video motion detector) in 5.9 +/- 0.5 minutes. Early after contracture development, the resupply of extracellular Na+, in the continued presence of CN + 2-DG, resulted in a rapid partial relaxation (t1/2 = 1.9 +/- 0.3 seconds), associated with an increase in 45Ca efflux, presumably due to transsarcolemmal Ca2+ extrusion due to Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Resupply of glucose and removal of CN + 2-DG, in the continued absence of Na+, resulted in an initially slower (t1/2 = 11.6 +/- 2.5 seconds), but more complete relaxation of contracture, which was not associated with increased Ca2+ efflux. Pretreatment with 20 mM caffeine delayed the onset of contracture (9.2 +/- 1.1 minutes) and resulted in a contracture that could not be relaxed by resupply of external Na+ only. Studies using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe indo 1 demonstrated that in zero-Na+-zero-Ca2+ solutions, contracture due to CN + 2-DG was associated with an initial rise in [Ca2+]i but that this did not account for all of contracture force development. In cells exposed to CN + 2-DG in the presence of normal extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, a small rise in [Ca2+]i was associated with initial contracture development, consistently preceding the development of a larger accelerated contracture presumably due to ATP depletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88027580\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors during ischemia in vivo, we developed a procedure for measuring alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in isolated, calcium-tolerant adult canine myocytes. Specific [3H]prazosin binding was rapid, saturable, reversible, and demonstrated the expected order of potency and stereospecificity for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. Myocytes exposed to 30 minutes of hypoxia at 25 degrees C or only 10 minutes at 37 degrees C exhibited a twofold to threefold increase in the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors with no significant change in receptor affinity. This hypoxia-induced increase in receptor number was reversible by 10 minutes of reoxygenation at 37 degrees C. In contrast, more prolonged hypoxia of 80 minutes or hypotonic shock actually decreased receptor number below normoxic, control values. The concentration of long-chain acylcarnitines in myocytes also increased threefold on exposure to 30 minutes of hypoxia. Sodium 2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-pentyl]-oxirane-2-carboxylate (POCA, 10 microM), a potent inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase I, not only abolished the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines but also the increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number induced by 30 minutes of hypoxia. Likewise, incubation of normoxic cells with exogenous palmitoyl carnitine (1 microM) for 10 minutes also increased alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number in the presence or absence of POCA. Thus, hypoxia results in an increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors associated with an increase in endogenous long-chain acylcarnitines. Furthermore, inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase I prevents not only the sarcolemmal accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines but also the exposure of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, indicating that accumulation of endogenous long-chain acylcarnitines is critical to the hypoxia-induced increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors on adult myocytes.\r"

Two interventions that resulted in impaired left ventricular relaxation, hypothermia, and reperfusion following a left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion were studied to evaluate whether there were associated changes in coronary blood flow. With both interventions, there was a significant prolongation of left ventricular relaxation (p less than 0.01) accompanied by a significant decrease in early diastolic coronary blood flow (p less than 0.01). Verapamil did not have a significant effect on these hemodynamic changes during hypothermia. However, verapamil significantly blunted the effects of reperfusion following ischemia on ventricular relaxation (p less than 0.002) and early diastolic coronary blood flow (p less than 0.01). Thus, impaired left ventricular relaxation has an adverse impact on early diastolic coronary blood flow, which, under the condition of reperfusion following regional myocardial ischemia, can be alleviated with calcium channel blockade.\r"

The isolated buffer-perfused rat heart was used with N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) as a spin-trapping agent. Samples of coronary effluent were taken and extracted into toluene for detection of radical adducts by ESR spectroscopy. After 15 minutes of total, global ischemia, aerobic reperfusion resulted in a sudden burst of radical formation that peaked at 4 minutes. When hearts were reperfused with anoxic buffer, no dramatic increase in radical production was observed. Subsequent reintroduction of oxygen, however, resulted in an immediate burst of radical production of a similar magnitude to that seen in the wholly aerobic reperfusion experiments. The ESR signals obtained (aN = 13.60 G, aH = 1.56 G) are consistent with the spin-trapping by PBN of either a carbon-centered species or an alkoxyl radical, both of which could be formed by secondary reactions of initially-formed oxygen radicals with membrane lipid components.\r"

Seizures, which activate sympathetic nerves, were induced in animals with intact nerves and after bilateral cervical sympathetic denervation. Increases in cerebral blood flow (microspheres) and decreases in cerebral vascular resistance were similar in denervated and innervated animals. Thus, during intense metabolic stimulation, metabolic factors are the primary determinant of cerebral blood flow, and bilateral effects of sympathetic nerves are minimal. The second goal of this study was to examine the role of vascular hypertrophy in protection of the cerebral circulation. Cerebral perfusion pressure was decreased on one side by clipping one carotid artery in 4-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Two to four months later, the clip was removed, and seizures were induced. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier in the cerebrum occurred predominantly on the clipped side. We suggest that reduction in perfusion pressure attenuates development of cerebral vascular hypertrophy and thereby increases susceptibility to disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, hypertrophy of cerebral vessels during chronic hypertension may protect the cerebral circulation.\r"

At the time of total ameroid occlusion, the ratio of circumflex to left anterior descending coronary artery function fell to 68 +/- 8% of control, with mean circumflex coronary pressure decreasing to 60 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Following ameroid occlusion, distal coronary pressure increased, and circumflex function recovered towards control but remained depressed relative to that in the left anterior descending coronary artery for 2-4 weeks. Measurements of regional subendocardial perfusion suggested a dissociation between subendocardial flow and function prior to but not following coronary occlusion by the ameroid. We conclude that this model results in reductions in regional function that are relatively prolonged and are not readily attributable to subendocardial infarction or a critical reduction in resting coronary flow. The data suggest that functional adaptations in response to gradually developing coronary occlusion are more complex than those associated with acute reductions in coronary artery pressure and flow.\r"

Although the predominant response is an increase in precapillary resistance that reduces blood flow through the tissue (at constant pressure perfusion), there are two distinct components that can be separated into an initial (1-2-minute) and late (2-15-minute) response. The initial (1-2-minute) response is a decrease in venous and capillary pressures in passive response to decreased flow promoted by an increase in precapillary resistance. Venous pressures are reduced even though postcapillary resistance is increased. The decrease in capillary pressure promotes absorption of fluid from tissue to plasma. Venous constriction results in a translocation of blood from the terminal venous system into the larger venous conduits toward the heart. Total blood volume in an isolated organ system decreases and is manifested as a decrease in volume (plethysmographic) or weight (gravimetric). The decrease in volume is result of three interrelated factors: 1) decrease in flow through the organ, 2) active venoconstriction and a translocation of blood out of the organ, and 3) absorption of fluid from tissue to plasma, which flows out of the organ with venous drainage. With continued sympathetic nervous system stimulation, the late response (3-15 minutes) is a gradual decrease in precapillary resistance that increases blood flow through the organ. Venous and capillary pressures passively increase in association with increases in flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In many tissues, a substantial fraction of total vascular resistance resides in the feed arteries that give rise to the microcirculation. We have explored the thesis that control of tissue blood flow is integrated over several levels of the vascular network, including feed arteries and microvessels. In response to muscular contraction, feed arteries (resting diameter 100-125 microns) of hamster cremaster and gracilis muscles dilated by 20-25%. Acetylcholine applied to distal microvessels of the cremaster induced a dilation that ascended into feed arteries not having direct contact with acetylcholine. In the hamster cheek pouch, iontophoretic application of acetylcholine onto an arteriole (diameter 20-30 microns) triggered a vasodilation that propagated along the arteriole. Propagation was not dependent on blood flow, indicating that the dilator response was conducted along the vessel wall. We found that preventing diameter changes in an arteriole segment along the apparent conducting pathway did not block propagated vasodilation, indicating that propagation was not mediated by a myogenic mechanism requiring changes in smooth muscle length. We investigated whether the conduction of a vasodilatory stimulus may be mediated by either a neural plexus intrinsic to microvessels or cell-cell coupling between the cells composing the arteriole. Tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) did not block propagated vasodilation, indicating that propagation is not mediated by a neural pathway. Hypertonic sucrose solution applied to an arteriole segment along the apparent conducting pathway attenuated propagation significantly, which is consistent with its reported effect to decouple gap junctions between cells. Thus, propagated vasodilation in arterioles may be mediated by direct cell-cell conduction.\r"

For peripheral stimulation, a bipolar electrode was placed on the internodal segment of the lumbar sympathetic chain between ganglia L1 and L2. For central stimulation, a bipolar electrode was stereotaxically implanted in the posterior hypothalamus. Inside vessel diameter, red blood cell velocity, and volumetric flow rate were recorded in response to electrical stimulations of varying magnitude in four series-coupled segments of the arteriolar network: 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A. Systemic arterial pressure was also monitored. The vasoconstriction and flow reduction produced by stimulation of the lumbar chain was graded with the frequency of stimulation over the range of 0.5-16.0 Hz in all arteriolar segments. Examination of the relation between stimulation frequency and vasoconstrictor response measured as percent of control diameter indicated a sequence of responsiveness to peripheral stimulation where 4A = 3A greater than 2A = 1A. No changes in diameter were recorded in the venous microcirculation at any level of stimulation. Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus with currents of 38-300 microA for 60 seconds produced graded vasoconstriction in only 3A and 4A vessels. Fluorescence histochemistry for biogenic amines was used to examine the distribution of innervation to the microvasculature. All segments of the arteriolar network from 1A to 4A possessed an adrenergic innervation; no vessels of the venous network were found to be innervated. The results indicate that the pattern of response of the arteriolar network in rat cremaster muscle to peripheral and central sympathetic stimulation is segmentally differentiated and consistent with the distribution of the vasomotor innervation.\r"

In one group, the periventricular tissue surrounding the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle (AV3V) was electrolytically lesioned 7-10 days before an acute experiment. In the other group, control surgical procedures were performed. Hemorrhage resulted in similar decreases in arterial blood pressure (30-60% prehemorrhage level) and intestinal blood flow (20-60% prehemorrhage level) in both groups. In contrast, arteriolar diameter significantly increased following hemorrhage in the spinotrapezius muscle of control-operated animals (141 +/- 9% prehemorrhage level) but did not change in animals with AV3V lesions (97 +/- 7% prehemorrhage level). In a previous study, electrical stimulation of intact AV3V tissue was shown to cause a sustained decrease in blood pressure (80-90% of control level) and a vasodilation in skeletal muscle arterioles (120-140% control level). Since stimulation of intact AV3V tissue evokes vasodilation and AV3V tissue ablation reduces hemorrhage-induced vasodilation, this region of the hypothalamus may play an important role in the regulation or modulation of some responses in the peripheral microcirculation.\r"

The effects of selective alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with prazosin were compared with nonselective alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine on coronary hemodynamics during exercise in chronically instrumented dogs. During control conditions, graded treadmill exercise resulted in progressive increases of myocardial oxygen consumption; this was associated with increased coronary blood flow as well as with increased myocardial oxygen extraction. Although prazosin and phentolamine caused similar reductions of arterial pressure, phentolamine increased heart rate, myocardial oxygen consumption, and coronary blood flow at equivalent exercise levels, and prazosin did not significantly alter these variables. These effects of phentolamine appeared to result from blockade of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which normally modulate norepinephrine release, that resulted in increased sympathetic effects on the heart. However, at comparable levels of myocardial oxygen consumption, prazosin and phentolamine resulted in similar significant increases of coronary venous PO2 and decreases of coronary vascular resistance. These data support a modest role for alpha 1-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction during exercise but fail to document an additional role for postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction during exercise.\r"

Electrical stimulation in a small region of perifornical lateral hypothalamus increased arterial pressure, heart rate, and coronary blood flow; following the administration of propranolol, a transient coronary vasoconstrictor response was unmasked. The response was mediated over the sympathetic nervous system since it was blocked by stellate ganglionectomy and by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. Projections to and from the lateral hypothalamic site were identified by using anterograde and retrograde pathway-tracing techniques. Paraventricular nucleus projected to lateral hypothalamus, which in turn made connections in periaqueductal gray with projections terminating in lateral reticular formation of medulla. Coronary vasoconstrictor responses qualitatively identical to those produced by hypothalamic stimulation were found with activation of paraventricular nucleus and lateral reticular formation. Interruption of neuronal transmission in the medullary site blocked the response produced by activation of hypothalamic site. These data demonstrate that coronary vasoconstriction mediated over the sympathetic nervous system can be elicited from an interconnected pathway that links sympathoexcitatory sites in forebrain and brainstem.\r"

Measurements of coronary microvascular diameter were completed in anesthetized, open-chest cat preparations in which the epicardial microcirculation was viewed through an intravital microscope using stroboscopic epi-illumination. Images of coronary microvessels were digitized and analyzed on a video monitor. With arterial pressure controlled, measurements in the absence and presence of beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg) were obtained during epinephrine infusion (1-2 micrograms/kg/min). In the absence of beta-adrenergic blockade, epinephrine produced a 25% increase in myocardial perfusion. Under these conditions, coronary vasodilation was observed in all classes of coronary arterial and arteriolar vessels. In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, epinephrine produced a significant decrease in myocardial perfusion (-20%). Nonuniform effects on diameter were observed in arterial and venous segments of the coronary circulation. These data are consistent with the view that in the absence of beta-adrenergic blockade, the functional coronary hyperemia associated with epinephrine administration is produced by uniform coronary arterial and arteriolar dilation. In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, with metabolic effects controlled, epinephrine produced a decrease in myocardial perfusion, which is related to a nonuniform decrease in coronary microvascular diameters. Such heterogeneous effects on microvascular diameters result in a redistribution of coronary microvascular resistance.\r"

Ten dogs were instrumented with a Doppler flow probe on the left anterior descending coronary artery. A chronic catheter was placed in the left circumflex coronary artery and in the aorta and left atrium. A Konigsberg pressure cell was placed in the left ventricle, and pacing leads were attached to the left atrium and ventricle. While heart rate was kept constant, bolus intracoronary injections of veratridine (0.1-0.4 microgram/kg) were administered in the unblocked state after beta 1-receptor blockade, after alpha-receptor blockade, and after cholinergic blockade. In the unblocked state, late diastolic coronary resistance fell by 34.7 +/- 5.0%. The maximum response was achieved at a time when arterial pressure was not significantly different from control. After beta 1-blockade, coronary resistance fell by 29.1 +/- 7.9%. After combined alpha- and beta-blockade, coronary resistance fell by 25.4 +/- 6.5% in response to veratridine. The addition of atropine completely blocked the decrease in coronary resistance, changing it by an average of -0.10 +/- 2.5%. The responses in sinoaortic denervated dogs were similar to those in intact animals. The response was abolished by vagotomy. We conclude that cardiac receptor stimulation causes a reflex decrease in coronary resistance in the awake dog that is completely accountable by a cholinergic mechanism.\r"

Serotonin (2-16 micrograms) infused as a bolus in the left atrium effected a dose-related biphasic response, which was characterized by an initial increase in vessel dimension with a peak response at 45-75 seconds, followed by a delayed and more sustained vasoconstriction, with a maximum response at 2-8 minutes. The magnitude of the initial vasodilation was generally greater than the delayed vasoconstriction. The initial vasodilation remained unchanged after selective S2 blockade with ketanserin (0.3 mg/kg) and was only minimally but insignificantly attenuated when flow was held constant but was reduced after S1 and S2 blockade with methysergide (0.25 mg/kg). Selective S2 blockade with ketanserin (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the delayed vasoconstriction in most but not all dogs; the effect of ketanserin was, however, not significant when the entire group was considered. Selective endothelial denudation effectively eliminated the initial vasodilation response to serotonin and significantly augmented the delayed vasoconstriction when the dogs were studied 1-2 days after denudation. The data indicate that in the awake dog, serotonin effects a biphasic vasomotor response characterized by an initial vasodilation that is mediated primarily through a direct endothelium-dependent S1 mechanism followed by a delayed vasoconstriction that is probably mediated via a direct S2 effect on the vascular smooth muscle and is attenuated by the normal endothelium.\r"

Similar blood flow responses were observed with carbon monoxide hypoxia in all brain regions except the neurohypophysis. The role of carotid and aortic chemoreceptors in mediating this blood flow response was studied in 6 additional dogs. Similar degrees of hypoxic hypoxia were produced in chemoreceptor-intact and completely denervated animals (CaO2 approximately 8 vol %, PaO2 approximately 33 mm Hg). Hypoxic hypoxia produced a 250% increase in neurohypophyseal blood flow and a concurrent rise in plasma arginine vasopressin from 8 +/- 3 to 52 +/- 8 pg/ml. Chemoreceptor denervation completely inhibited the increase in neurohypophyseal blood flow associated with hypoxic hypoxia.

In the present study, we performed serial measurements of PCr and pH during gradually incremental flexor digitorum superficialis exercise in 22 patients with CHF and 11 age-matched controls to determine: (1) whether abnormalities were present at the same relative workloads (a comparison that would at least partially compensate for differences in muscle mass), (2) the temporable course of the metabolic changes, (3) the relationship of the metabolic findings to clinical variables, and (4) the relationship of the metabolic abnormalities to forearm blood flow. The patients with CHF had significantly lower [PCr] and pH at all submaximal levels of exercise, and these abnormalities were apparent from the onset of low-level exercise. There was considerable heterogeneity among the patients with CHF with respect to the metabolic findings, with 14 of 22 exhibiting either PCr or pH values more than 2 SDs below normal. Patients whose capacity was more limited during the protocol had lower [PCr], and especially pH, at low loads than did other patients with CHF or the control subjects. The more symptomatic patients and those with more limited bicycle exercise tolerance also had lower pH values. In contrast, there were no significant differences in forearm blood flow between the patients and controls and no relationship between forearm blood and either clinical variables or the metabolic findings. These results indicate that skeletal muscle metabolic abnormalities are present in many patients with CHF and that they are not primarily due to either muscle atrophy or impaired blood flow. These changes may explain in part the marked heterogeneity of symptom status and exercise capacity of patients with similar degrees of cardiac dysfunction.\r"

Steady-state cardiac outputs were determined by thermal dilution. Aortic systolic and mean pressures were not significantly changed during the Mueller maneuver, in contrast to a lower diastolic (p = .019) and higher pulse pressure (p = .016). Mean right atrial pressure (+/- SE) decreased from 7 +/- 1 to -17 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = .0002) and the right atrial \"x\" descent was markedly accentuated. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 12 +/- 4 to -3 +/- 13 mm Hg (p = .0025). Systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular peak positive dP/dt were increased during the Mueller maneuver (p less than .02), cardiac output and stroke volume were reduced (p less than .05), and there was no significant change in heart rate. Right and left peak flow velocities showed a trend toward a bilateral decrease (right, p = .054; left, p greater than .1), and times to peak flow velocity were increased in the pulmonary artery (p = .007) and reduced in the aortic root (p = .03). Normal subjects were studied separately by pulsed Doppler echocardiography.

  ".W": "The transition from fetal to neonatal circulatory status is accompanied by marked alteration in relative right and left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressure. These alterations would be expected to influence both global and regional performance of the left ventricle. To address this issue, sequential two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed in normal newborns during the first days of life. Global and regional left ventricular wall motion were quantified by computer digitization with the use of an automated edge detection algorithm and a floating-center-of-mass model. Comparison was made with a control group of normal infants and young children and the sequential change over the first 5 days of life was assessed. Newborns were found to have a circular left ventricular configuration at end-diastole beginning on day 1. At end-systole, however, there was significant left ventricular distortion due to septal flattening, which persisted until day 3 and resolved entirely by day 5 of life. Regional wall motion analysis demonstrated a corresponding augmentation of septal and contralateral left ventricular free wall systolic movement during the first days of life, with a normal pattern attained by day 4. Due to the nonhomogeneity of the left ventricular wall motion in the first few days of life, standard single-dimension shortening fraction provided an unreliable measure of global left ventricular performance before day 4. Thus, systolic right ventricular hypertension at a level sufficient to distort the left ventricular configuration is present until day 4 or 5 of life, resulting in altered left ventricular regional wall motion. As a result, usual M mode echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function is unreliable in this age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the cases of 702 patients found to have isolated atrial septal defect of the secundum or sinus venosus type at catheterization from 1953 to 1978. Forty patients (6%), 34 women and six men, had pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, with a total pulmonary resistance greater than 7 U/m2; of these patients 26 (mean age 47 years) underwent surgical closure and 14 (mean age 44 years) received medical treatment. All patients were followed for at least 4 years, with a median follow-up of 12 years. At the most recent follow-up, 17 of the 40 patients were dead. Of the 22 surgically treated patients with total pulmonary resistance less than 15 U/m2, 19 were alive with significant regression of symptoms. All four surgically treated patients with total pulmonary resistance greater than or equal to 15 U/m2 were dead. Of the five medically treated patients with total pulmonary resistance less than 15 U/m2, four had died, and one was alive with significant progression of symptoms. Of the nine medically treated patients with total pulmonary resistance greater than or equal to 15 U/m2, six had died and the three survivors had progression of symptoms. In the surgically treated group, the following variables correlated with survival: total pulmonary resistance (p less than .00001), pulmonary arteriolar resistance (p less than .00001), pulmonary-to-systemic resistance ratio (p = .004), systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p = .005), and pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation (p = .007). In conclusion: (1) Atrial septal defect with high total pulmonary resistance is uncommon and predominates in adult female patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In study patients, logistic regression identified two independent predictors of induced, sustained VT for both S3 and S4 protocols: prior spontaneous, sustained VT (37 patients; p less than or equal to .001) and prior myocardial infarction (113 patients; p = .005). With the S3 protocol, sustained VT was induced in 54% of patients with both prior myocardial infarction and prior sustained VT vs 4% without either; with the S4 protocol, sustained VT was induced in 91% vs 13%, respectively. Eighty-three percent of induced VT episodes had a cycle length less than 300 msec, and all required termination by cardioversion or pacing. VF was induced only in survivors of out-of-hospital VF without prior, spontaneous, sustained VT (S3 protocol, 9%; S4 protocol, 24%) but not in study patients with prior sustained VT (S3, p = .10; S4, p = .05) or control patients (S3, p = .06; S4, p = .01).

Quantitation of mineral content by chemical assay has not been reported for failed clinical valves removed from adults. In this study, calcium determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy was done on 52 removed porcine valves after routine pathologic examination, including specimen radiography done by a standard technique. Specimens included 31 valves with calcific primary tissue failure, two calcified (but not overtly dysfunctional) valves removed simultaneously with failed valves, 14 nondeteriorated valves obtained at reoperation or autopsy after long-term implantation, and five valves removed within 1 month after insertion. Chemically determined mineral content varied widely among patients and duration of function. Valves with calcific failure had 113 +/- 68 micrograms/mg calcium overall (mean +/- SD) after 36 to 156 months (mean 87) of function. Almost all dysfunctional porcine valves with radiographically demonstrated calcific deposits had greater than 34 and 67 micrograms/mg calcium for mitral and aortic valves, respectively. Nondeteriorated valves (implanted 8 to 145 months, mean 57) had 5 +/- 6 micrograms/mg calcium. Failed aortic valves had more calcium than failed mitral valves and valves with calcific stenosis more than valves with regurgitation caused by calcification with tearing. Correlation of semiquantitative radiographic grading with chemically determined valve mineral was good, indicating that radiographic assessment of calcification may be used reliably for clinical comparisons between valves.\r"

To determine which characteristics of trains facilitate capture and which enhance inhibition, we compared the right ventricular strength interval relationship for single extrastimuli (S2) with that for 100 Hz trains with a duration of 100 msec in 29 patients. Pulse frequency was varied in 12 patients (50, 100, and 200 Hz) and train duration (50, 100, and 150 msec) was varied in 11 patients; the effect of procainamide (10.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml) was assessed in 10 patients. Relative to S2, 100 Hz trains with a duration of 100 msec prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) at low current strength (inhibition), but shortened the ERP at high-current strength (summation): at 0.5 mA, the train ERP was 47 +/- 6 (SEM) msec longer than the S2 ERP (p less than .001); at 16 mA it was 12 +/- 1 msec shorter (p less than .001). Trains prolonged the functional refractory period (FRP) slightly at low currents (13 +/- 3 msec, p = .001 at .05 mA), but did not shorten FRP significantly at high currents (2 +/- 2 msec, p = NS at 16 mA) because of increased stimulus-response latency. Inhibition increased with increasing pulse frequency (p less than .001), increasing train duration (p less than .001), and procainamide (p less than .01). Summation increased with increasing pulse frequency (p less than .001), but not increasing train duration or procainamide, suggesting that inhibition and summation depend on different electrophysiologic mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the ability of the slope (Emax) and the volume intercept (Vo) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) to indicate contractility changes in conscious dogs instrumented with sonomicrometers measuring left ventricular diameter in three orthogonal axes and a left ventricular pressure microtransducer. ESPVRs were generated by inferior vena caval occlusion under control conditions (C1 and C2) and during enhanced (I+) and depressed (I-) inotropic states achieved by infusion of dobutamine and injection of propranolol, respectively. No significant difference between the first control (C1) and I+ or between the second control (C2) and I- were found for either Emax (C1, 5.31 +/- 1.68 mm Hg/ml, mean +/- SD; I+, 5.37 +/- 1.44; C2, 5.20 +/- 1.62; I-, 4.18 +/- 1.32) or Vo (C1, 10.3 +/- 9.6 ml; I+, 7.3 +/- 9.1; C2, 9.9 +/- 9.0; I-, 12.7 +/- 12.5), despite significant changes in other indexes of contractility. Comparison of changes in Emax in individual animals in response to I+ and I- revealed that 63% were nonsignificant, 28% were significant and expected, and 9% were significant and paradoxical. Within defined volume limits and irrespective of individual changes in Emax and Vo, in all animals I+ shifted the ESPVR above and to the left of C1 and I- shifted the ESPVR below and to the right of C2. We thus integrated the changes in Emax and Vo by measuring the area beneath each ESPVR between defined limits of end-systolic volume. The values for area were: C1, 612 +/- 150 mm Hg.ml; I+, 745 +/- 191 (p less than .001); C2, 520 +/- 198; I-, 420 +/- 139 (p less than .001). We conclude that (1) neither Emax nor Vo are individually reliable indexes of changed contractility, and (2) the area beneath the ESPVR between defined end-systolic volume limits is a consistent indicator of variations in inotropic state.\r"

We used ion-selective and bipolar plunge electrodes, epicardial unipolar electrodes, a suction electrode, and ultrasonic crystals to determine the changes in intramyocardial extracellular potassium ([K+]e) and extracellular pH (pHe), local activation, epicardial TQ-ST segment, monophasic action potential duration (MAPD), and regional contractility during graded coronary flow reduction in open-chest pigs. A carotid-to-coronary shunt was created to perfuse the left anterior descending coronary artery via a roller pump. The shunted coronary flow was reduced in a stepwise fashion at 5-min intervals. In 25 pigs, the approximate myocardial blood flow associated with the initial changes in each variable was as follows: midmyocardial [K+]e, pHe, and TQ-ST segment, 0.7 to 0.8 ml/min/g; subepicardial [K+]e and TQ-ST segment, 0.6 to 0.7 ml/min/g; segmental shortening, 0.5 to 0.6 ml/min/g; local activation and epicardial TQ-ST segment, 0.3 to 0.4 ml/min/g; epicardial MAPD, 0.15 to 0.2 ml/min/g. Our results indicate that changes in [K+]e, pHe, and TQ-ST segment provide the most sensitive means of detecting myocardial ischemia and of determining the effect of interventions capable of influencing the ischemic process.\r"

After 90 min of proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, 20 dogs were randomized to blood reperfusion with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) adenosine into the proximal left anterior descending vessel at 3.75 mg/min for 60 min after reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined serially with microspheres and regional ventricular function was assessed by a computerized radial shortening method. At 24 hr, the area at risk was defined in vivo with monastral blue dye and area of necrosis was determined after incubation of left ventricular slices in triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Hemodynamic variables were similar in the two groups during the experimental protocol. Infarct size was significantly reduced in treated animals, both when expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (9.9 +/- 2.8% vs 40.9 +/- 6.6%, p less than .001) and as a percentage of the left ventricle (4.6 +/- 1.3% vs 18.0 +/- 3.4%, p = .002). This was associated with significant improvement in radial shortening in the ischemic zone 24 hr after reperfusion (10.1 +/- 2.5 vs -2.8 +/- 2.2%, p less than .01). Regional myocardial blood flow was significantly increased in endocardial and epicardial regions from the lateral ischemic zone 1 hr after reperfusion in adenosine-treated animals. Light microscopy demonstrated decreased neutrophil infiltration in the ischemic zone and electron microscopy showed relative preservation of endothelial structure in the subendocardium with reduced neutrophil and red cell stagnation of capillaries in the treated group. These findings suggest that intracoronary administration of adenosine after reperfusion significantly reduces infarct size and improves regional ventricular function in the ischemic zone in the canine preparation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that verapamil has an effect on ischemia-initiated arrhythmias related to its regional influences on recovery of excitability and conduction time. Using a coronary perfused preparation of cat left ventricle that allows simultaneous electrophysiologic monitoring of both endocardium and epicardium, we studied the effect of verapamil on ischemia-induced changes in transmembrane action potentials, conduction properties, and refractory periods of endocardial and epicardial muscle cells. Oxygenated Tyrode's solution was perfused through the left anterior descending coronary artery, while the preparation was superfused with Tyrode's solution gassed with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. \"Ischemia\" was produced by stopping coronary perfusion. During 30 min of ischemia, resting potential, action potential amplitude (APA), and action potential duration (APD) were reduced, and conduction time was prolonged in both endocardial and epicardial cells, but the changes were greater in the epicardial cells. Endocardial refractory periods shortened in parallel with APD shortening throughout 30 min of ischemia, whereas epicardial refractory periods shortened for the first 10 min and then increased due to development of longer postrepolarization refractoriness. As a result, there were significant differences in refractory periods between endocardial and epicardial cells at 10 and 30 min of ischemia, and rapid ventricular activity could be induced at these times. Exposure to verapamil (1 mg/liter) before cessation of coronary perfusion significantly limited the reduction of APA and the prolongation of conduction time during the first 10 min of ischemia in epicardial cells, but did not influence endocardial cells. During the remaining 20 min of ischemia, verapamil enhanced the reduction of APD of both epicardial and endocardial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A Y-shaped lesion in the right atrium allows induction of atrial flutter in dogs. We recorded the activation sequence during this tachycardia from 96 endocardial bipolar electrodes using intracavitary electrode arrays during 12 separate episodes in three isolated perfused hearts. In each case a reentrant impulse circulated around the tricuspid valve orifice in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Cutting the pathway terminated the rhythm and prevented its reinduction. There was no discrete segment of markedly slow conduction in the reentrant circuit. The tachycardia cycle length was decreased by methacholine and increased by lidocaine. Reentry was also induced in atrial tissue around the tricuspid orifice when this structure was isolated and superfused in vitro. Tachycardia cycle lengths varied from 205 to 399 msec, depending on the circumference of the ring and temperature. Induction of tachycardia by premature stimulation depended on differences in the duration of the effective refractory period among parts of the ring. Conduction velocity was relatively uniform and was slower during tachycardias than during pacing at long cycle lengths. Analysis of the response to premature stimuli that reset the tachycardia provided evidence for incomplete recovery of excitability between depolarizations during the tachycardia. Fast-response action potentials were recorded throughout the pathway and up to six to eight cell layers deep. Histologic studies showed the supravalvular lamina, a circumferential band of fibers several cell layers below the endocardial surface, to be continuous around the tricuspid orifice. Propagation through this layer best explains the conduction velocities observed in the intact heart during flutter in this preparation.\r"

Most internal defibrillation electrodes require 5 to 25 J for successful defibrillation in human beings and in dogs. In an attempt to lower the shock strength needed for defibrillation, we designed two large titanium defibrillation patch electrodes that were contoured to fit over the right and left ventricles of the dog heart, covering areas of approximately 33 and 39 cm2, respectively. In six anesthetized open-chest dogs, the electrodes were secured directly to the epicardium and ventricular fibrillation was induced by 60 Hz alternating current. Truncated exponential monophasic and biphasic shocks were given 10 sec later and defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) were determined. The DFT was 159 +/- 48 V, 3.2 +/- 1.9 J (mean +/- SD) for 10 msec monophasic shocks and 106 +/- 22 V, 1.3 +/- 0.4 J, for biphasic shocks with both phase durations equal to 5 msec (5-5 msec).

Since patients with mitral stenosis often have exaggerated leftward (paradoxic) motion of the ventricular septum during early diastole, we studied seven patients with mitral stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization to determine if position (and therefore motion) of the ventricular septum was determined by TSG throughout diastole. M Mode echocardiograms derived from a two-dimensional parasternal short-axis view were recorded with simultaneous micromanometer measurements of left ventricular and right ventricular pressures. Six of seven patients demonstrated abnormal early diastolic leftward motion of the ventricular septum in at least one cardiac cycle. TSG measured at intervals throughout diastole ranged from -2.5 to +20 mm Hg, with abnormal TSG observed in most of the 40 cardiac cycles selected for analysis. The intracardiac position of the ventricular septum, defined as the distance from the right ventricular epicardium (RVEpi) to the left surface of the ventricular septum normalized for total cardiac dimension (RVEpi-VS), was plotted against left ventricular pressure, right ventricular pressure, and TSG. Linear regression of pooled data from all patients (164 observations) demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the instantaneous TSG and the relative intracardiac position of the ventricular septum (RVEpi-VS = 1.52 TSG + 42.7; r = .79, p less than .0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracoronary thrombolysis was performed from 2 to 6 hr after the onset of AMI, and the time from the onset of AMI to death was 7 to 168 hr. Cineangiography revealed no evidence of good collateral circulation in any of the patients. The 16 patients were classified into three groups: six patients with successful thrombolysis (100% to 99% stenosis, group I), five patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis (100% to 100%, group II), and five patients with 99% stenosis before thrombolysis (group III). Among the three groups, there were no significant differences in the time from the onset of AMI to thrombolysis, the time from the onset of AMI to death, the cause of death, or the degree of collateral circulation. The percentage of the risk area involved by the infarct in group I (82 +/- 6%) was similar to that in group II (80 +/- 11%). Infarct size was not reduced in group I because collateral circulation was not good and because the degree of recanalization after thrombolysis was 1%. However, the percentage of the infarct area with CBN was significantly higher in group I (20 +/- 9%) then in group II (3 +/- 3%). This finding shows that diffuse CBN occurred after reperfusion in patients with AMI treated with thrombolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The long-term prognosis of variant angina and the factors influencing it were assessed in 217 consecutive patients hospitalized in our coronary care unit and followed for a mean of 65 months (range 2 to 123). Cardiac death occurred in 30 patients and an additional 54 experienced a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Survival at 1 and 5 years was 95% and 89%, respectively; survival without infarction was 83% and 69%. Coronary disease and the degree of disease activity were strong predictors of survival by Cox analysis. Survival at 1 year was 99%, and that at 5 years was 95% and 94%, respectively, for patients with one-vessel disease (n = 81) and for those without stenoses of 70% or greater (n = 87). Survival at 1 and 5 years was only 87% and 77% for those with multivessel disease (n = 40). The Cox analysis selected left ventricular function, initial treatment, extent score, duration of angina at rest, and disease activity as multivariate predictors of survival without infarction. Coronary disease was a strong predictor (p less than .0001) of survival without infarction by univariate analysis. Treatment with nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil improved survival without infarction compared with other medical treatment (p = .002). Myocardial infarction occurred most commonly soon after diagnosis in patients with a short history of angina at rest. Late coronary events were almost never preceded by resting angina.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate medium-term clinical results of two major methods of myocardial revascularization, we compared 80 consecutive patients with multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with 80 consecutive patients with coronary surgery using both internal mammary arteries in all and additional venous grafts in some. Patients in the surgical group had a higher extent of coronary artery disease. In patients with PTCA a mean of 2.2 vessels per patient were attempted, and in patients with surgery 2.7 distal anastomoses per patient were performed. Primary success for PTCA and surgery was 86% vs 94% and complications occurred in 7% vs 6%, respectively. Control angiograms, done in 86% of patients (59/69) after successful PTCA, showed a recurrence in 42% (25/59). Repeat PTCA was done in 15, elective surgery in seven, and a medical treatment was pursued in 3% patients with restenosis. Recurrence of symptoms after successful surgery was found in three patients (4%). They were treated with PTCA. Clinical follow-up was available for all patients, at a mean of 12 +/- 6 months after PTCA and 16 +/- 9 months after surgery. Mean improvement was 1.5 NYHA functional classes after successful PTCA and 2.1 after surgery; 60% (48/80) vs 89% (48/80), respectively, were in class I (p less than .0001). There were fewer PTCA patients than surgical patients without antianginal drugs at follow-up (19% [11/58] vs 37% [18/48]; p less than .05), and their double product during exercise testing was inferior (272 +/- 56 vs 295 +/- 47 mm Hg X beats/min/100; p less than .05). Medium-term clinical outcome appears better after successful surgery with both internal mammary arteries than after successful multivessel PTCA.\r"

The standard approach was a generous transaortic myectomy. One-quarter of the patients underwent concomitant repair of associated lesions. There was one operative and two late deaths, for an actuarial 5 years survival 93% (+/- 8%). Average follow-up is 3 years per patient. Sixty-four percent of these patients are asymptomatic and another 30% were in New York Heart Association class II. Persistent symptoms were usually related to arrhythmias. Early atrioventricular block did not occur, but two patients were paced for complex arrhythmias 3 and 4 years after surgery. Hemodynamic studies (n = 22), two-dimensional echocardiographic (n = 47), and Doppler assessments (n = 23) demonstrated a left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient of 70 and 14 mm Hg before and after surgery, respectively, left ventricular diastolic pressure of 18 and 14 mm Hg, percent of patients with mitral regurgitation of 70% and 30%, percent of patients with systolic anterior motion of 100% and 35%, and percent of patients with aortic insufficiency of 9% and 49%. Eight-six percent of the patients catheterized had no resting obstruction. Subaortic myectomy produces symptomatic improvement by reducing the left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient, mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and probably improves longevity.\r"

There is always the risk that cardiopulmonary bypass and heparinization may exacerbate the neurologic injury. There is no clear data indicating what is a safe interval of time from the onset of neurologic symptoms to the time of surgery. Since 1982 we have operated on 15 patients with recent (2 to 28 days, mean 12.7 +/- 7.9 days) neurologic injury. Indications for surgery included recurrent embolization, sepsis, and hemodynamic deterioration. Three patients were comatose with no focal neurologic signs at the time of surgery, and 12 patients had focal neurologic deficits. All patients had preoperative computed tomographic scans. Embolic cerebral infarctions were documented in 12 patients, one patient had evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient had a subdural hematoma. Fourteen patients had native or prosthetic valvular endocarditis and one patient had a left atrial myxoma. All patients underwent corrective cardiac surgery. One patient died in the postoperative period from multisystem failure; all other patients have been followed since discharge (6 months to 4 years). All surviving patients demonstrated improvement in their neurologic symptoms and eight patients had complete neurologic recovery. The results of this study indicate that open heart surgery can be safely performed in patients with recent neurologic injury.\r"

Although intraoperative epicardial real-time two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography (two-dimensional Doppler) is an accurate and efficient technique for assessing the presence and severity of a residual lesion, it requires placement of a transducer in the operating field and consequent obstruction of the operative procedure. Transesophageal two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography (transesophageal two-dimensional Doppler), which can be applied intraoperatively and postoperatively without such problems, was performed in 35 patients during cardiac surgery (12 patients) and/or at an intensive care unit within 6 hr after cardiac surgery (30 patients). In those with constrictive pericarditis, an extensive pericardiectomy was performed with effective monitoring by intraoperative transesophageal two-dimensional Doppler. Abnormal posterior wall motion was observed in the case of left ventricular rupture (type III) after mitral valve replacement 3 hr before clinical manifestation. After prosthetic valve replacement (18 St. Jude Medical valves, one Carpentier-Edwards valve, one Bjork-Shiley valve), no perivalvular leakage was detected, but minor physiologic transvalvular leakage was noticed in 11 patients with St. Jude Medical valves. In two patients with congenital heart disease, a small residual shunt was detected. In a patient in which a composite valve graft with direct coronary artery reattachment (Bentall's operation) was performed, reattachment was confirmed to be satisfactory. In conclusion, intraoperative and early postoperative monitoring of cardiac function by transesophageal two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography can improve the results of cardiovascular surgery by providing accurate information on cardiovascular structure and blood flow dynamics.\r"

The slope of the linear stroke work vs end-diastolic volume relationship, an index of contractility, was preserved by each vehicle. Similarly, oxygen utilization to perform external mechanical work during reperfusion was unaffected in all groups. However, there were significant 119% and 122% increases in basal oxygen utilization after both unoxygenated and oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia (p less than .05) that were prevented by the blood-based vehicle. These data suggest that the salutary effects of blood cardioplegia on postischemic myocardial energetics may not be solely mediated by its oxygen-carrying capacity.\r"

A new technique of retrograde cardioplegia delivery through the right atrium, using right ventricular distension and pressures of 60 mm Hg, has recently been described with excellent clinical results. This study was designed to specifically examine right ventricular function after atrial cardioplegia and acute passive right ventricular distension. CSCP (n = 10) was compared with cardioplegia delivered through the right atrium both continuously (n = 10) and intermittently (n = 8). When ventricular function was examined with the use of the load-independent relationship of stroke work vs end-diastolic length, there was a profound deterioration of right ventricular function in both atrial cardioplegia groups (44% and 37% of control values, respectively) after 1 hr of reperfusion. In contrast, biventricular function was fully preserved in the CSCP group 1 hr after reperfusion. Left ventricular function measured at the end of reperfusion was preserved in all three groups. Right ventricular ATP levels were slightly but significantly depressed in all groups and in the atrial cardioplegia groups, this metabolic change was also seen in the left ventricle. These metabolic and hemodynamic data may reflect the inability of atrial cardioplegia to cool the myocardium below 16 degrees C. Postoperative right ventricular dysfunction may be more common than has been previously thought when atrial cardioplegia is used, particularly in the absence of topical cooling.\r"

A myocardial biopsy sample was obtained before aortic cross-clamping (AXC) and 20 min after release of AXC (AXC time 22 to 161 min, mean 68 +/- 37 min), and semiquantitative assessment of the mitochondrial structure was made by scoring. The post-AXC score was significantly higher than the pre-AXC score (1.1 +/- 0.6 vs 0.4 +/- 0.4, p less than .001) for the whole group. Patients receiving preoperative catecholamine support had higher pre- and post-AXC scores than those who did not (pre-AXC score 0.7 +/- 0.4 vs 0.2 +/- 0.3, p less than .01; post-AXC score 1.4 +/- 0.5 vs 1.0 +/- 0.5, p less than .05).

With respect to post-AXC score, only those less than 3 months old had significantly higher values than the other infants. These results indicate that the myocardial injury was not fully prevented by crystalloid potassium cardioplegia in infants, and that infants with preoperative heart failure and less than 3 months old appear to have increased myocardial susceptibility to ischemic injury under cardioplegia.\r"

Our recent canine studies showed that newborn hearts had a shorter time interval between the beginning of global ischemia and the onset of contracture than the adult hearts. To reconcile this finding with the known better tolerance of newborn hearts to hypoxic perfusion, we hypothesized that the greater anaerobic glycolytic capacity of immature myocardium leads to greater accumulation of lactate during total ischemia, resulting in tissue acidosis and earlier irreversible damage. In this study, newborn and adult rat hearts were excised and incubated in normothermia for 0, 5, 10, and 15 min. The newborn myocardial lactate contents were significantly higher (p less than .05) than those in the adult hearts. In another series of rats, 20 meq/liter of KCl was injected to produce cardioplegia before the excision of the hearts. The differences in lactate levels were even greater. The data are consistent with the lactate hypothesis, and suggest that in clinical neonatal cardiac preservation, providing sufficient washout may be beneficial.\r"

Protocol I consisted of 30 min of normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemic arrest and reperfusion, protocol II of 60 min of hypothermic (15 degrees C) ischemic arrest and warm (37 degrees C) reperfusion, and protocol III of 120 min of hypothermic ischemic arrest and cool (21 degrees to 25 degrees C) reperfusion. After protocol I, the neonatal hearts recovered 23% greater contractile function than the adult hearts; after protocols II and III the neonatal hearts recovered 51% to 55% more function than the adults.

A comparison of the myocardial concentrations (mumol/g wet weight) of ATP, glycogen, lactate, and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) was also done. The anesthetized animals underwent a sternotomy, and control right ventricular myocardial biopsy samples were taken. The heart of each was rapidly excised and placed in a 37 degrees C substrate-free Krebs-Henseleit bath. A compliant balloon was placed in the left ventricle to record pressure changes. Time to onset and peak TIC were recorded and additional proximal right ventricular biopsy samples were taken. Data were recorded as mean +/- SEM. Results demonstrated that neonatal hearts had a significantly shorter (p less than .05) TIC (29.5 +/- 1.7 min) than adult hearts (43.0 +/- 2.9 min) and exhibited more rapid lactate accumulation (2.5 +/- 0.5 to 22.1 +/- 3.0, p less than .001) and an increase in G-6-P (0.07 +/- 0.03 to 0.34 +/- 0.07, p less than .01) with a nonsignificant decline in myocardial glycogen (23.3 +/- 12.1 to 17.4 +/- 4.0, p greater than .05).

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals and phospholipid degradation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia and reperfusion injury. The present study examines the involvement of such mechanisms in myocardial reperfusion injury in neonatal hearts. The isolated neonatal pig hearts from two different age groups, 0 to 2 days old (newborn) and 7 to 9 days old (week-old), were subjected to 60 min of normothermic global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Although myocardial ischemia reduced superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in both age groups, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities remained significantly lower in the newborn pig heart during ischemia and reperfusion. Oxidized glutathione release from the neonatal pig hearts was at minimum levels before ischemia, but it increased 10-fold at the onset of reperfusion and was significantly higher in the newborn heart. This indicates that generation of oxygen free radicals was enhanced in the newborn compared with that in the week-old heart. The increase in phospholipase A2 activity and decrease in acyl CoA synthetase and lysophosphatidylcholine acyl transferase activities during ischemia and reperfusion were associated with comparable loss of membrane phospholipids and accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine and free fatty acids in both age groups, except that oleic acid content was significantly higher in the newborn heart during reperfusion. Myocardial damage appears to be potentiated in the newborn heart during reperfusion, as evidenced by higher release of creatine kinase and a lower content of high-energy phosphates. These results indicate that oxygen free radicals may play a crucial role in the occurrence of reperfusion injury in immature hearts.\r"

We studied the effects of chronic pressure overload RVH on left ventricular systolic function before and after reversible hypothermic global ischemia. RVH was induced by pulmonary artery banding (PAB) in newborn piglets (5 to 7 days). At 2 months of age the PAB group (n = 6) and a control group (n = 8) were subjected to cardiac arrest on cardiopulmonary bypass with cold crystalloid cardioplegia (10 degrees C) for 2 hr and were reperfused for 1 hr. Left ventricular function was assessed by a conductance catheter in the left ventricle measuring the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Emax). Preischemic and postischemic Emax were the same in the control group (4.1 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/ml before vs 4.1 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/ml after ischemia), but significantly different in the PAB group (4.7 +/- 0.5 mm Hg/ml before vs 2.97 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/ml after ischemia, p less than .05).

  ".W": "The hydroxyl radical is one of the most damaging oxygen metabolites that are thought to be produced during ischemia and reperfusion of cardiac tissue. Therefore, we used the isolated, isovolumetric, buffer-perfused rat heart preparation of cardioplegic arrest to assess the effects of interventions targeted at inhibiting production of the hydroxyl radical by decreasing either the availability of one of its precursors (hydrogen peroxide) or that of the metal catalyst (ferric iron) involved in the radical formation. Sixty hearts were studied and, except for nonischemic controls, were subjected to 3 hr of hypothermic (15 degrees to 18 degrees C) cardioplegic arrest, followed by 45 min of reperfusion. The following interventions were tested: pretreatment with peroxidase, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, pretreatment with a combination of peroxidase and the iron chelator deferoxamine, pretreatment with peroxidase followed by supplementation of the cardioplegic solution with deferoxamine, and supplementation of the cardioplegic solution with deferoxamine without preischemic enzymatic treatment. Based on comparisons of postreperfusion pressure development, maximal ventricular dP/dt, left ventricular compliance, and coronary flow, deferoxamine-containing cardioplegic solution alone afforded the best myocardial protection. This may be due to the ability of deferoxamine to act both as an iron chelator and as a direct scavenger of superoxide anion, an activated oxygen species that participates in hydroxyl radical formation. This study confirms that an important component of the cardiac damage sustained during global ischemia and reperfusion may involve injury caused by the hydroxyl radical. Furthermore, our results point out the potential therapeutic usefulness of deferoxamine in the context of cardioplegic protection during open-heart procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Current use of angioplasty, thrombolysis, and surgical techniques for prompt reperfusion of an acute myocardial infarction raises questions concerning the optimum reperfusion technique for maximum myocardial salvage. Alterations in the conditions of reperfusion and/or the composition of the initial reperfusate can exert a significant effect on the extent of myocardial salvage. In an effort to define an optimum reperfusion technique, we used 40 dogs in a series of experiments in which the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was snared for 2 hr followed by reperfusion by one of five methods for 4 hr. In addition, in a control group(group I, n = 6) the LAD was occluded for 6 hr without any reperfusion. In group 2 (n = 12), simulating medical reperfusion, reperfusion was achieved by simply releasing the snare for 4 hr. Group 3 dogs (n = 6) were placed on pulsatile left atrial-femoral bypass throughout 4 hr of reperfusion. Group 4 dogs (n = 9) were placed on percutaneous, synchronized pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass during reperfusion. The procedure in group 5 (n = 7) dogs simulated coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass and cold blood, low-Ca++ cardioplegia during reperfusion. Group 6 (n = 6) was treated similarly except that during reperfusion amino acid-enriched cardioplegia was administered by warm induction techniques. At the end of 4 hr of reperfusion, the left ventricular area of infarction was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and expressed as a percentage of the left ventricular area at risk for infarction (area of infarction [AI]/area at risk [AR]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potential for salvaging infarcting myocardium depends on the time course of the infarction process. To determine the rate of infarct evolution in an end-artery coronary preparation similar to the coronary arterial system of the human heart, each of 84 swine underwent a reversible occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for varying lengths of time, after which flow was reestablished into the occluded region for either 2 or 48 hr. Infarct size was assessed by nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining and confirmed by histologic examination in the 48 hr animals. The region at risk of ischemic injury was determined by injection of monastral blue dye. Infarction progressed rapidly, with a mean of 1.9 +/- 1.5% of the risk region infarcting after 15 min of occlusion, 20.3 +/- 5.7% at 30 min, 43.3 +/- 4.8% at 45 min, 59.9 +/- 2.4% at 60 min, 70.6 +/- 1.7% at 90 min, 84 +/- 2.0% at 180 min, and 88.6 +/- 2.0% after 48 hr. Although there was good correlation in infarct sizing between NBT and histologic techniques at 2 and 48 hr of reperfusion, NBT underestimated infarct size at 15 and 30 min. These data suggest that in the setting of an end-artery coronary anatomy, reperfusion must be carried out within 90 min of coronary occlusion to achieve significant salvage of infarcting myocardium, a period of time much shorter than previously suspected.\r"

  ".U": "88027659\r", 
  ".W": "Among 123 patients undergoing a direct operation, with or without other cardiac surgical procedures, for life-threatening ventricular tachycardia as a complication of ischemic heart disease, 68% of surviving patients were free of the return of ventricular tachycardia or sudden death 2 years after operation and 55% were free of these events at 5 years. The instantaneous risk (hazard function) of these events was highest immediately after operation and declined rapidly, so that by 3 months after operation instantaneous risk had merged with the constant-hazard phase which persisted as long as the patients were followed. More advanced impairment of left ventricular structure and function (with the exception of left ventricular aneurysm) increased the risk of occurrence of these events. Among patients with a negative electrophysiologic study (EPS) at hospital discharge, freedom from recurrent ventricular tachycardia or sudden death was 85% at 3 years. Survival, taking into account hospital deaths, was 54% 2 years after operation and 33% at 5 years. Most commonly (65% of instances) death was a result of acute, subacute, or chronic heart failure. The use of the technique of encircling endocardial myotomy increased the risk of death. Survival was particularly poor after the return of ventricular tachycardia. Direct operations for ventricular tachycardia are most likely to succeed in the presence of a discrete left ventricular aneurysm. The results are particularly unfavorable when there is severe global left ventricular dysfunction and no aneurysm. Improved myocardial protection during operation, and more specifically EPS-guided operations, may reduce the early risk of death and of return of ventricular tachycardia. The late return of ventricular tachycardia may be more related to a progressive secondary left ventricular cardiomyopathy than to an inadequate operation.\r"

There was no significant difference between the subgroups with regard to either the presence of infection or the spectrum of organisms grown. We conclude that while infection in the adenoid bed must be involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial otitis media, the concentration of organisms present in the adenoids is unimportant and other factors must be responsible for the migration of organisms up the Eustachian tube.\r"

The deaths after 5 years were not directly related to the original tumour. The functional results with respect to the voice were excellent. In this study particular attention has been paid to the postoperative results with regard to swallowing and aspiration. More than half of the patients (56%) had occasional complaints of aspiration, especially when taking liquids.

T-lymphocytes and T-lymphocyte subsets were reduced significantly in the patients, but the T-helper: T-cytotoxic ratio was normal. Cellular immunity abnormalities were therefore found in the peripheral blood of patients with recurrent Bell's palsy, supporting the concept that this is an immunomediated demyelinating disease.\r"

We studied 10 patients with relapsing MGN and compared the findings with those in other clinical courses. The mean duration of follow-up was 10.4 years. Clinical remission occurred, on average, 1.5 years and relapse, on average, 5.6 years after onset. Thirty-one renal biopsies obtained at various clinical phases were studied, 22 of them electron microscopically. The ultrastructural and clinical alterations paralleled each other closely. Subepithelial electron-dense deposits were present during the primary nephrotic phase, were replaced by intramembranous lucent deposits during remission, and reappeared again during relapse. Light microscopic changes (projections, thickening) of the glomerular capillary basement membrane (GBM) were variable. Both ultrastructural and light microscopic changes were unreliable indicators of the duration of illness. A comparative analysis of the present and previous findings suggests that the length of time during which new deposit material is formed determines the evolution of the membranous lesion and the corresponding clinical course. Thus, a short duration results in a single generation of deposits, a morphologically and clinically healing course, and no thickening of the GBM. A repeated formation of deposit material results in a new generation of subepithelial deposits, and a relapsing course. A prolonged formation results in a continuous presence of subepithelial deposits, a thickening of the GBM, and a protracted or progressive course. The morphologic staging currently in use pertains to one particular evolution and course of MGN and therefore should not be used.\r"

The subjects studied included 98 children and 86 adults. Development into renal failure occurred in 9 children (9.2%) and in 20 adults (23.3%), (p less than 0.01). The actuarial renal survival rate at year 10 after the onset of glomerulonephritis in children and adults was 95% and 80%, respectively, and at year 20, 82% and 50%, respectively. The prognosis was definitely better in the children and this was attributable to the observation that (1) the glomerular injury at the initial biopsy in children was less extensive than in adults; (2) the frequency of complication with hypertension was lower in children (27.6%) than in adults (41.9%), (p less than 0.05); (3) hypertension was one prognostic indice, even in children, after age 30; (4) after age 40, aging and arteriosclerosis were more contributory than hypertension to the progress of IgA nephropathy; and (5) the quantity of intraglomerular immune deposits and the period of deposition were not related of prognostic indices. Thus, in the long-term prognosis of IgA nephropathy in both children and adults, immunological disorders seem to have little influence while factors such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis and aging play important roles.\r"

A 0.25 mm silver clip was placed on the left renal artery of SHR male rats. The same procedure performed on WKY rats served as control. All experiments were performed on low, normal, and rich sodium diet. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail-cuff method. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was determined before and after clipping of the renal artery. Results were as follows: Mean systolic BP increased significantly in clipped rats fed with normal and rich sodium diets. SHR showed an increase from 144 +/- 3 (mean + s.e.m.) to 168 +/- 3 mmHg, and WKY rats showed an increase from 120 +/- 2 to 139 +/- 5 mmHg. There was a two- to threefold rise in PRC. A low-salt diet given prior to clipping prevented the appearance of renovascular hypertension despite a significant rise in PRC. We concluded that renal artery narrowing plays a significant role in the rise of BP in the basically essential type of hypertension.\r"

Higher blood, plasma and serum viscosity and lower erythrocyte filtrability were found in our patients with overt nephropathy, than in patients without renal microvascular complications. Several negative correlations between blood viscosity and renal hemodynamic parameters (i.e., glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were demonstrated in the diabetics with overt nephropathy. Furthermore increased plasma fibrinogen, fibronectin and acute-phase protein levels were found in diabetics with overt nephropathy, compared to diabetics without renal changes. The data may suggest a pathogenetic role for blood rheology changes in the progression of diabetic glomerular complications.\r"

These experiments demonstrated a significant increase in cell numbers within the joint. Receptor activity was most marked on macrophages found free within the synovial fluid. It is postulated that exogenous cells may be important in the process of joint destruction and are outside the control of the normal joint regulatory mechanisms. The endogenous cell population, which exhibits receptor activity, may be responding to the process of joint destruction by proliferation as a secondary phenomenon.\r"

The speed was increased by 1 km/hour every four minutes, until the subjects has walked for four minutes at 7 km/hour, or until they could not continue. Oxygen consumption, heart rate, cadence, and step length were measured. The controls could all walk for 1400 m, reaching a walking speed of 6 km/hour, and showed a consistent relation between heart rate, oxygen consumption, and speed of walking. The majority of arthritic patients failed to reach either this distance or speed. They had a significantly increased metabolic cost, and there was a good correlation (r = 0.65 to 0.99) between the changes in pulse rate and oxygen consumption in each individual patient. The endurance, heart rate response, and oxygen consumption changes shown by patients proved to be reproducible characteristics in patients whose disease was static.\r"

Roentgenographic examination demonstrated healing of the CFRP-plated tibiae with abundant callus, and almost total remodeling of the fracture callus between ten and 20 weeks. Biomechanical testing by three-point bending revealed little difference between the strength of union of the fractures at 12-16 weeks.

A four-sided titanium alloy locking nail with transfixing screws was designed in 1967 and allows compression of the fracture site. If necessary, the nail may be inserted without intraoperative roentgenograms, and permits early weight-bearing in most cases. One hundred seventy-one difficult fractures in femora, humeri, tibiae, and ulnae have been treated with this nail since 1974. Many cemented total hip arthroplasties are failing. A cementless, modular titanium alloy and alumina hip, based on the nail with a modular alumina or titanium head, will allow cementless hemi- or total hip arthroplasty. Porous, 200-microns ceramic coating on the stem allows bone ingrowth while transfixing screws allow full and immediate postoperative weight-bearing. A ceramic sleeve and spacers also allow modular replacement of the upper three-quarters of the femur for tumors and trauma. A similar shoulder and humerus is also available. Fifty-four hips and two shoulders have been successfully replaced since January 1983. In addition, 285 bones with pathologic or potential pathologic fractures caused by secondary tumors have been stabilized by the author between August 1972 and August 1986, with a variety of implants.\r"

A maximum score of 25 points is available in each of four categories for a total of 100 points. The objective rating score was determined in a series of 101 patients prior to treatment of lumbar disc herniation by chemonucleolysis. The patients were evaluated at least one year after injection.

In a retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients with POD followed for an average of 29 months (17-42 months), the CT scan was extremely sensitive in showing a pathogen was present. The CT scan was misread in over one-third of the cases. Gram-positive cocci were the only organisms cultured (10 of 13 cultures, 8 of 12 patients). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) invariably fell predictably to normal within 90 days when patients were treated with IV antibiotics for more than 40 days. Most patients were clinically improved and subjectively better at follow-up examination. No correlation existed between the patient's subjective result and preexisting medical conditions, the type of antibiotic, or the length of treatment, the ESR, or the follow-up roentgenograms.\r"

Primary silicone radial head implants fractured in all three patients in which they were used, necessitating repeat surgery in two patients to date. While loss of motion in terminal extension was a common aftermath of displaced olecranon fracture (59%), it was usually minor and functionally insignificant.  True Kirschner-wire migration was not a common problem and can probably be eliminated by proper technique. The presence of gaps in the intraarticular surface of the semilunar notch of the ulna produced no ill effects and was compatible with excellent results. If only those cases with isolated olecranon fractures in this series are considered, there were good and excellent results in 29 of 30 cases (97%). Excision of the olecranon fragment(s) should be reserved for those cases when anatomic restoration cannot be achieved with internal fixation.\r"

A transverse osteotomy in fresh cadaver specimens was internally fixed and was tested to failure by rapid loading. Screw plus wire in combination provided the greatest strength of fixation. Energy to failure averaged 31.0 Nm for cancellous screw, 32.0 Nm for figure-of-eight wire, 35.3 Nm for Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) tension band, and 39.4 Nm for screw-plus-wire combination. Comparison of screw and wire in combination to screw alone or to figure-of-eight wire demonstrated a significant difference (p less than 0.05). The difference between screw plus wire and AO tension-band fixation did not achieve statistical significance (0.2 greater than p greater than 0.1).\r"

Factors associated with poorer results included postoperative displacement or malreduction greater than or equal to 2 mm and articular involvement greater than or equal to 60%. Symptomatic metal prominence was particularly common after AO tension-band wiring, occurring in 80%. All seven comminuted fractures were treated by primary excision. The one comminuted fracture with greater than or equal to 60% articular involvement that was treated by excision had a poor result because of instability.\r"

The following arthroscopic portals were investigated: anteromedial, anterocentral, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral. Overlapping of vision fields was noted with the three anterior portals. Optimum visualization of a lesion was obtained when the arthroscope was placed on the same side as the lesion. Lesions on the posterior aspect of the talar dome and within the posterior talar pouch required the posterior placement of the arthroscope for optimum visualization. The use of the anterocentral approach, with a 2.7-mm arthroscope yields good visualization of the anterior aspect of the joint, and very often, of the posterior compartment. Anatomic guidelines for the avoidance of neurovascular structures and the exact placement of the arthroscope in both anterior and posterior portals are presented and were specifically defined in two additional fresh ankle specimens.\r"

For the active, posttraumatic patient, ankle joint fusion is superior and avoids the attendant high failure rate. In general, salvage of failed TAA is best solved by ankle fusion. Only in one of five cases (a compliant patient with a clear-cut correctable technical error) was a good result achieved with a revision arthroplasty. To maintain limb length, the authors transplanted iliac crest autogenic bone to fill a large defect. When tightly packed with bone, the joint is slightly distracted and compression enhances fusion. For septic loosening, osteotomy of the malleoli and fusion without grafting is recommended. Persistent pain unassociated with loosening an infection may be treated by removal of impingement of bone overgrowth. Soft tissue release to improve motion is rarely successful. Marginal skin slough was a problem in 8.5% of 71 cases. To facilitate healing, debridement of nonfunctional exposed tendons may be advisable.\r"

Especially, TKA without patellofemoral replacement has a significant incidence of patellofemoral problems with a frequency between 5% and 45%. Pathomechanical factors in the development of retropatellar problems are loss of patellar thickness and retropatellar erosions. In 157 TKAs using Gschwend, Scheier, Bahler (GSB) joints without patellar resurfacing, pathomechanically postoperative vertical patellar malposition appeared to be the main cause of dysfunction. In many cases, the implantation technique leads to an artificial form of patella alta. This altered knee anatomy results in pathologic biomechanics, thus leading to reduced function. The combination of altered anatomy and reduced function leads to extensive patellar destruction and ultimately to intractable retropatellar pain.\r"

Graphs plotted from the data demonstrate the height of the metatarsal heads in a normal individual, changes in the height of the metatarsal heads with and without weight-bearing, before and after insole placement, and before and after metatarsal osteotomy. This information may be useful in obtaining a better understanding of abnormalities of the forefoot as related to bony anatomy and load distribution.\r"

Synthetic activity of the chondrocytes was quantified by measuring the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) from electron micrographs using a sterologic point-counting method. Extra loading of the joint by running, or by increased weight-bearing after splinting of the contralateral limb, caused a 20% and 30% increment of RER in the middle and deep zones of the cartilage, respectively, while immobilization decreased the amount of RER by 30% in the superficial zone. Some attempts to repair and regenerate were observed, especially in the deep zone of articular cartilage. Hypertrophy of cells and organelles, and cell replication were considered as signs of reparative processes. The accumulation of fine intracytoplasmic filaments (FIF) in chondrocytes, regarded as a sign of cell degeneration, was reduced in the exercise group. FIF also decreased in the deep zone chondrocytes of the immobilized group, which could be indicative of improved or retained viability of the chondrocytes.\r"

Four-point bending was performed on each specimen, first intact, and then after sequential instrumentation, thus allowing each specimen to serve as its own control. The mean stiffnesses obtained for the bone-device complexes, as a percentage of the intact tibial stiffness, were 113 +/- 9% for the delta frame fixator, 57 +/- 14% for the dynamic compression plate, 28 +/- 2% for the unilateral external fixator (UEF) with stainless steel sidebar, 18 +/- 1% for the UEF with aluminum sidebar, 7 +/- 2% for the flexible intramedullary (IM) rods, and 6 +/- 2% for the cast. Even relatively flexible unilateral external fixators are much stiffer than cast or IM rod fixation, methods that usually lead to satisfactory union by secondary healing. If secondary union with callus formation is desirable, modifications of the external fixator may be necessary to provide more flexible fixation. This study may be one of the first attempts to quantitate the stiffness of tibial fixation in a standard cast and compare it with other devices.\r"

Intravenous challenge required high inocula to establish arthroplasty infection, whereas infection around the prosthesis was consistently established after inoculation of 10(3) bacteria into the femoral medulla. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) proved the most reliable clinical test of infection. Hematogenous infection was difficult to reproduce. Three weeks after operation, the arthroplasty was as resistant as the normal hip. Antibiotics were administered in doses equivalent to doses used in the treatment of infections in humans. When gentamicin-impregnated cement was used, 60 times the number of organisms were required to establish infection. Flucloxacillin and Imipenem gave similar protection. Rifampicin gave protection to a level exceeding the lethal dose of organisms for the model.\r"

A population-based study of CDH in children up to the age of two years who were born in Western Australia (WA) in 1981, 1982, or 1983 is the subject of this report. Study material comprised cases of CDH from the WA Congenital Malformations Register and denominator data (all births in WA for 1981-1983) from the Health Department of WA. From this material, rates of CDH were calculated for each of the study variables of interest. The rate of CDH was low for babies born to aboriginal mothers, and it is postulated that this may have a cultural basis, possibly in infant carrying postures. Overall, the prevalence of CDH for 1981-1983 was 6.4 cases per 1000 births, with 4.2/1000 diagnosed in the neonatal period and 2.2/1000 in the postneonatal period. Epidemiologic differences were noted between infants diagnosed in the neonatal period and those diagnosed postneonatally; rates of neonatally diagnosed CDH were higher in first births, breech presentation, and postmature infants than were rates of postneonatally diagnosed cases. Bilateral dislocation was more common (45.3%) in neonatally diagnosed cases than in postneonatally diagnosed cases (23.3%). These findings tended to support the idea that the time of diagnosis may define two distinct entities in CDH.\r"

The complication rate was low. Best results were achieved with two or three threaded pins placed into the posteroinferior segment of the femoral head to avoid avascular necrosis. Early upper femoral osteotomy was not required, as considerable bone remodeling occurred even after growth plate closure. In contrast, avascular necrosis was common following treatment of acute, severe slips, even with gentle internal rotation of the leg to reduce the acute component of the slip and pinning.\r"

Clinical details were obtained from each athlete. Assessment then consisted of measurement of spinal movement in the sagittal plane using spondylometers and movement in the rotation plane using a rotameter. Body trunk strength was measured with the athletes in their own wheelchairs using a myometer. This gave a recording of kilograms of force. Trunk balance was assessed on both a static and a dynamic basis. The age, sex, follow-up period, and body weight for both spinal fusion and conservatively treated groups were similar. There was little difference in the incidence of pain between those treated by conservative and operative methods. There was statistically significant difference in the range of sagittal plane and rotation movement. There was no difference in flexor trunk power measured with the myometer between the two groups, but when extensor power was measured it was found to be 25% less in the spinal fusion group. There was no difference between the two groups when tested for static and dynamic trunk balance. Two other athletes who had had spinal fusions extending from the upper thoracic region to the sacrum showed unusually poor trunk stability. Overall, this study demonstrates that spinal fusion, particularly over multiple segments in complete paraplegics, has a deleterious effect not only on spinal movement but also on body trunk strength.\r"

A measurement study of 204 cadaveric lumbar spines from subjects ranging in age from one day to 97 years confirmed data on loss of \"spinal stature\" but could not confirm a loss of disc height. With aging, there is a progressive increase in vertebral end-plate concavity, associated with decreased bone density. These changes are more evident and take place earlier in females than in males. In the cancellous bone of vertebral bodies, a decrease in the number of horizontal trabecular \"cross braces\" leads to fracture of the vertical weight-bearing \"beams\" supporting the vertebral endplate. The intervertebral discs expand centrally and become increasingly convex. Measurements of average disc height demonstrate that loss of disc height is unusual in a normal, aging population. Only a minority of lower lumbar discs from elderly subjects show \"thinning\" and degeneration (beyond Rolander's Grade 2). Thus, loss of stature in the elderly is attributable to loss in vertebral height rather than loss in disc height. Dessication and thinning of discs, or discs that \"bulge like underinflated automobile tires\" are not typical of elderly spines.\r"

The responses of NICU mothers were significantly more highly correlated with their perceptions of their children's responses than were the mother-child correlations observed in a comparison group. The NICU children were reported by their mothers to ask about the NICU equipment, pain, being alone, their physical scars, and if their being \"bad\" caused their need for intensive neonatal care.

The decrease in hypoprothrombinemia observed with concomitant administration of therapeutic doses of rifampin was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the elimination half-lives of both warfarin enantiomers. Rifampin increased the clearance of (R)-warfarin threefold and the clearance of (S)-warfarin twofold. The excretion profiles for warfarin and its metabolites in urine and feces were similar for both control and treated subjects with the exception that 4'-hydroxywarfarin (stereoselective for the (S)-enantiomer) was observed when rifampin was administered. 4'-Hydroxywarfarin is a metabolite of the drug hitherto undetected in vivo in humans. Based on formation clearance values estimated for 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxywarfarin, rifampin appears to increase the clearance of the parent drug by induction of the cytochrome P-450 isozyme(s) responsible for aromatic hydroxylation.\r"

Three individuals reevaluated 13 to 20 days after discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy demonstrated pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of the control group. Limited studies performed in patients receiving combination anticonvulsant therapy did not demonstrate an additive effect on prednisolone elimination. Differences in the degree of enhancement of prednisolone and methylprednisolone disposition in all three anticonvulsant study groups suggest that different metabolic pathways may be involved.\r"

However, the validity of this approach and its proper role in new drug development is unclear. This study was performed to evaluate the ability of three approaches to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters: the traditional approach, mixed-effect modeling, and a simple pharmacokinetic screen. The evaluation was performed with data collected during a multicenter, open-label study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of imipramine and alprazolam in combination. The traditional pharmacokinetic study demonstrated a 20% decrease in the clearance of imipramine in the presence of 4 mg/day alprazolam. Mixed-effect modeling extends these findings by suggesting that the interaction is dependent on the simultaneous concentration of alprazolam, a finding that was not possible under the study design typically used for traditional pharmacokinetic studies. Although the simple screen suggests the presence of the drug-drug interaction, limited information regarding pharmacokinetic parameters is available and those parameters that can be estimated are biased.\r"

Studies were carried out in vitro using an ultracentrifugation method to quantify bile acid binding to the different components of a Lundh test meal, and to determine what factors influence bile acid binding to one of the components (casein). We validated the ultracentrifugation method by showing good agreement with the equilibrium dialysis method. Studies were carried out in vivo on jejunal aspirate from 10 ileal resection patients in order to determine whether bile acid binding to casein could be demonstrated, and whether this influenced aqueous-phase bile acid and fatty acid concentrations. 2. In vitro, the Lundh test meal was found to adsorb bile acid. The protein content of the meal (casein) alone accounted for this binding, which was abolished by use of casein hydrolysate. The binding to casein was a saturable process. Both binding affinity and binding capacity were significantly greater for taurocholate at pH 4.5 than at pH 6.5, and for dihydroxylated than for trihydroxylated bile acid, suggesting that hydrophobic bonding was involved. 3. In vivo, jejunal samples aspirated at pH greater than 6 from 10 ileal resection patients showed 25% binding of bile acid to protein. On substitution of amino acids for casein, mean binding was reduced to 16% (P less than 0.05), residual binding being attributed to endogenous protein. This was associated with an increase in fatty acid solubilization from 28% to 60% (P less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calculation of this dead space during multiple-breath, inert gas wash-in or wash-out leads to an estimate of 'multiple-breath alveolar mixing efficiency' (MBME). 2. We measured MBME in 25 healthy subjects and six patients with chronic airflow limitation (CAL), and in three asthmatic patients before and after bronchial provocation with histamine aerosol, from successive breaths during open-circuit, multiple-breath wash-in of a mixture containing helium (He) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The simultaneous use of a light and a heavy gas helps to identify diffusive mechanisms. 3. MBME fell almost linearly with log Z, the proportion of total wash-in remaining uncompleted. For a given Z, MBME was always lower for SF6 than for He in the same subject. In health the lowest MBME (52.2%) was seen for SF6 in a man aged 21 years. The same wash-in yielded a ventilation distribution with an extreme range of specific ventilation of less than 1 decade. MBME of this order is thus consistent with estimates of ventilation distribution in health. 4. Patients with CAL showed a big increase in the volume of the conducting airways or 'series dead space' (VDS) for both gases, and VDS was always bigger for SF6 than for He. This very large VDS appears to be the main reason for wash-in delay in these patients, followed by impaired diffusive mixing in the peripheral air spaces. Ventilation maldistribution may play little part in the mixing defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gas-liquid chromatography of lipid extracts showed that arachidonic acid was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (19 +/- 4) and Crohn's disease (20 +/- 3) than in controls (13 +/- 5 micrograms/mg of protein) (means +/- SD). Neither the degree of inflammation nor treatment with sulphasalazine or prednisolone appeared to influence the fatty acid concentrations. 3. Seventy-five to ninety-five per cent of the arachidonic acid was found in the phospholipid fraction after separation by thin-layer chromatography. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of the other fatty acids measured, although oleic acid was lower in inflammatory bowel disease. The ratios of oleic acid to stearic acid and to palmitic acid were lower in inflammatory bowel disease. 4. The alteration in the fatty acid profile may partly explain the increased synthesis of eicosanoids in colonic mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

The fractional dextran clearances of molecules with a radius greater than or equal to 5.4 nm also increased significantly after frusemide injection. Pretreatment with indomethacin partly inhibited the increments in clearances of macromolecules. 3. The changes in the fractional protein clearances correlated significantly with those of inulin clearance There was also a high degree of correlation between the changes in fractional protein clearances and prostanoid excretion. 4. The data obtained suggest that frusemide increases glomerular permeability by influencing the effective pores of the glomerular capillary wall. The increased permeability possibly is due to changes in prostanoid synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "1. Serum creatine kinase (CK) and muscle soreness, common indicators of muscle damage, were assessed in 16 subjects after performance of two bouts of eccentric exercise spaced 7 days apart. The purpose was (1) to examine rapid muscle adaptation when the ipsilateral limb was exercised on the second bout and (2) to investigate possible central adaptations when the contralateral limb was exercised on the second bout. 2. The LSL group (n = 7) and the LOL group (n = 9) performed the exercise with the ipsilateral and the contralateral limb, respectively. Careful attention was paid to stabilization of the subject so that the contralateral limb was not active in isometric stabilization. 3. For the LSL group, a lower CK and soreness response was found on about 2 compared with bout 1. For the LOL group, no significant difference in CK response and soreness was found between bout 1 and bout 2. 4. No repeat bout effect was found when the contralateral limb was exercised; therefore central adaptation from performance of the first exercise was minimal. Because a lower repeated bout effect was found after bout 2 using the ipsilateral limb, it was concluded that an experimental design using ipsilateral muscle groups should provide a good model to study rapid muscle adaptation to exercise damage.\r"

Twelve male diabetic patients inhaled nebulized histamine in doubling concentrations from 0.03 mg/ml to 32 mg/ml until they reached the maximum concentration or until their forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) fell by at least 20%. Six had evidence of severe autonomic neuropathy (DAN), while the other six did not. 2. More of the DAN group decreased their FEV1.0 on histamine inhalation by at least 20% (P less than 0.02) and more of them decreased their maximal flow at 50% vital capacity by at least 20% than those in the group without DAN (P less than 0.05). 3. The fall in FEV1.0 and in maximal flow at 50% of vital capacity was greater (P less than 0.05) in the DAN group than in the group without DAN. 4. This suggests that diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy have increased bronchial reactivity to histamine. This could either be due to differential damage of the respiratory autonomic nerves or, alternatively, to denervation hypersensitivity.\r"

Lymphocyte beta-receptor mediated adenylate cyclase activity (EC 4.6.1.1) was not decreased in the ambulatory cystic fibrosis patients as compared with controls. In contrast, decompensated hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients demonstrated a significant reduction in beta-receptor mediated lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity expressed as the relative increase over basal levels stimulated by the beta-agonist isoprenaline compared with both normal controls and stable ambulatory cystic fibrosis patients (control 58 +/- 4%; ambulatory cystic fibrosis patients 51 +/- 7%; decompensated hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients 28 +/- 5%; P less than 0.05). 3.

Sixteen hyperthyroid patients, six hypothyroid patients, nine patients taking thyroid or antithyroid drugs and 26 healthy controls were studied. The medicated patients were euthyroid when serum samples were collected. Bile acid concentration was determined by the simplified microassay method involving mass fragmentation spectrometry. 2. The sum of the concentrations of the individual bile acids was not significantly different among the four groups. However, the composition of bile acid reflected the thyroid function. The most prominent bile acid was deoxycholic acid in the hypothyroid patients and chenodeoxycholic acid in the hyperthyroid patients. The serum bile acid profile of medically treated patients was similar to that of normal controls. The ratio of the sum of deoxycholic and cholic acid to that of lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acid was found to be a good indicator of thyroid function, while the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid correlated poorly with it. 3. The characteristic effect of thyroid hormone on the serum bile acid composition in man was the shift from the 'family' of cholic acid to that of chenodeoxycholic acid. This is in agreement with experimental results in the rat, and suggests a specific action of thyroid hormone on the hydroxylating enzymes involved in the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids.\r"

It has not been documented, however, whether in the presence of coronary stenosis atrial fibrillation exceeds the effects of rhythmic atrial tachycardia. 2. The effects of experimentally induced atrial fibrillation compared with atrial tachycardia, therefore, were tested in 22 anaesthetized dogs. Stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was induced to reduce coronary blood flow by about 40%. 3. In the presence of coronary stenosis, atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate: 234 +/- 21 beats/min) reduced coronary blood flow from 58 +/- 7 to 44 +/- 8 ml min-1 100 g-1 (P less than 0.001, mean +/- SEM) and subendocardial segment shortening (ultrasonic crystals) from 12 +/- 2 to 4 +/- 2% (P less than 0.0025), and resulted in a lactate production of 30 +/- 11% (P less than 0.005 vs sinus rhythm). 4. Atrial tachycardia (heart rate: 216 +/- 21 beats/min, NS vs atrial fibrillation) did not significantly change coronary blood flow and reduced segment shortening to 7 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05 vs atrial fibrillation). Significant lactate production did not occur. 5. Since mean arterial pressure fell from 100 +/- 4 mmHg at sinus rhythm to 89 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.01) during atrial fibrillation but not during atrial tachycardia, it was held constant in 13 dogs by a pressurized blood reservoir. Coronary blood flow, however, fell from 43 +/- 6 to 36 +/- 5 ml min-1 100 g-1 (P less than 0.0025). 6. Thus atrial fibrillation may reduce coronary blood flow and induce myocardial ischaemia in the presence of coronary stenosis in excess of atrial tachycardia.\r"

The stair climb acts as a stress test and, although there is a strong relationship to pulmonary function tests, it also is an indicator of many other parameters including cardiovascular status, cooperation, and determination. Based on results of this study, the stair climb can be used as a reliable screening test of pulmonary function. Also, preoperative patients who are unable to perform pulmonary function tests can be evaluated accurately for lung resection by use of the stair climb test.\r"

Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data were compared during four successive periods of the respiratory cycle: inspiration, early expiration, mid-expiration, and late expiration. During inspiration, 2DE showed a significant increase in right ventricular area at both end-systole and end-diastole. This inspiratory right ventricular enlargement coexisted with a significant reduction in 2DE stroke area and pulmonary artery pulse pressure suggesting an inspiratory reduction in right ventricular stroke output. A transient depression of right ventricular function during deep inspiratory effort in asthma was thus strongly suggested. The negative pressure surrounding the right ventricle at inspiration is advocated as the causative factor enabling reduction in the hydraulic force effecting right ventricular ejection. The highly negative pleural pressure probably holds the right ventricular free wall and restrains its systolic inward motion, as suggested by the finding of a concomitant inspiratory reduction in right ventricular developed pressure and 2DE fractional area contraction.\r"

However, no significant correlation could be found between SvO2 and CI during the most critical periods of the surgery that included the collapse of the left lung, the aortic clamping, and the aortic declamping. During DTAAR, continuous SvO2 monitoring is useful, but it cannot substitute for intermittent cardiac output and oxygen consumption (VO2) determinations.\r"

Neurologic disturbances, which were seen in 17 patients, included headache, vomiting, memory disturbance, clouding of consciousness, or coma. Chest roentgenograms revealed patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern, and enlargement of the right ventricle. Hemodynamic studies by right cardiac catheterization showed that high-altitude pulmonary edema was noncardiogenic. Scintiscans of the lungs with technetium-99m-macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) performed in one patient showed decreased perfusion of 99mTc-MAA in the area of infiltrates. Pulmonary edema fluid collected through the endotracheal tube in two patients was rich in protein. Computerized tomograms of the brain showed small ventricles and cisterns, disappearance of sulci, and diffuse low density of the cerebrum, indicating cerebral edema in eight of nine cases. Retinal hemorrhage and papilledema were observed in five patients.\r"

We analyzed ten parameters in 83 forced expirations produced by 32 normal subjects (16 men and 16 women) using multidimensional scaling techniques. Among these expirations, 53 presented a wheeze. The first two axes of the analysis define a plane on which forced expirations are divided into four quadrants. Two opposite quadrants (upper right and bottom left) contain the wheezing expirations, while the two others only have the ones with no wheezing. This distribution corresponds to specific shapes of the flow rate curve. We found that wheezes are associated with two main shapes. One of them consists of a short onset until a sharp peak, followed by a fast exponential decay. The other is about triangular, with a late appearance of the wheeze, and is only produced by women.\r"

Questionnaires were completed when the lavage specimens were first submitted and again after the results were reported to referring physicians. We recorded the clinicians' ordered list of likeliest diagnoses for the patient, a level of confidence in each diagnosis mentioned, and any proximate plans for further diagnostic tests. Of 78 patients in the study, information from the BAL fluid cell analysis caused clinicians to change their diagnostic thinking in 46 (59 percent). These changes were far more frequently appropriate (52 percent) than not (9 percent), and clinically impressive changes did occur but were infrequent (3 of 78 [4 percent]) in this series. Specifically, BAL permitted the unexpected diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii in a patient not previously suspected to have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and appropriately encouraged clinicians to avert planned surgical biopsies in two patients subsequently found to have sarcoidosis. These findings suggest that when used to evaluate nonimmunocompromised patients, BAL fluid cell analysis can have an important impact on clinicians' diagnostic reasoning about their patients' interstitial lung diseases.\r"

The initial dose of tobramycin was 3.3 mg/kg of body weight three times daily (ie, 10 mg/kg/day). A highly significant relationship was found between the serum concentration of tobramycin before the dose and the change in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), both measured on the tenth day of treatment (rs = 0.75; p less than 0.001). In nine of the 16 patients who had a six-hour serum concentration of 1 mg/L or less on the tenth day of treatment, the eight-hour dosing interval of tobramycin was shortened to achieve a serum concentration of tobramycin of about 1 mg/L before the dose. In the other seven patients, the dosage of tobramycin was not changed. On the 20th day, seven of the nine patients in whom the dosing interval was shortened exhibited an increase in FEV1 of 20 percent or more. Such an increase was observed only in one of the seven patients in whom the dosing interval was not reduced (p less than 0.05). We conclude that individualizing the dosage of tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis results in a better clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant primary cardiac tumors have uniformly been associated with poor long-term survival. We reviewed data on 11 patients with such tumors seen between 1956 and 1986. There were five men and six women, with a mean age at presentation of 44 years. Nine (82 percent) of 11 patients presented initially with respiratory symptoms, and 45 percent (five) presented with chest pain. No patient was asymptomatic on initial presentation. Forty-five percent (five) of the patients had elevated jugular venous pressure or a systolic murmur. Cardiomegaly was present in eight (73 percent) of 11 patients. Nine of ten patients had a hemoglobin level less than 12 g/100 ml, and 30 percent (3/10) presented with thrombocytosis. Seventy percent (eight) of the patients underwent surgical biopsy, and in 30 percent (three), surgical excision of the tumor was attempted. Angiosarcoma was the most frequent type of tumor (four patients), followed by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (three patients), mesothelioma (two patients), rhabdomyosarcoma (one patient), and primary lymphoma (one patient). Long-term follow-up data reveals that ten (91 percent) of 11 patients had died, with a mean duration from diagnosis until death of 9.7 months. Newer pathologic techniques for identification of sarcomas, aggressive surgical resection, and advanced chemotherapy for certain subgroups may contribute to better survival for patients with these tumors in the future. In addition, cardiac transplantation may play an important role in the future for those patients with localized disease.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the mechanism of polycythemia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), serum and urinary levels of erythropoietin and medullary erythroid progenitors were studied in 21 patients; nine were nonpolycythemic (hematocrit, 39 +/- 4 percent; red blood cell [RBC] mass, 28 +/- 5 ml/kg; forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1], 0.6 +/- 0.1 L), and 12 patients were polycythemic (hematocrit, 52 +/- 7 percent; RBC mass, 46 +/- 7 ml/kg; FEV1, 0.9 +/- 0.3 L). Hypoxia was severe in both groups, with mean arterial oxygen pressure of 47 mm Hg. The following parameters of tissue oxygenation were not significantly different between the two groups: arterial and mixed-venous oxygen saturations; cardiac output; oxygen utilization coefficient; 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate, and carboxyhemoglobin level. The level of erythropoietin was measured by bioassay in vitro. The level was increased in the serum of 85 percent (18) and in the urine of 38 percent (8) of the patients. There was no significant difference between the nonpolycythemic and polycythemic groups. Without exogenous erythropoietin, none of the subjects showed spontaneous colonies of erythroid progenitors. The addition of one unit of erythropoietin induced a similar normal proliferation of erythroid progenitors in both groups. The absence of adaptative polycythemia in the nonpolycythemic group with severe hypoxia was seemingly related neither to a quantitative deficit of erythropoietin nor to a lack of sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to its action.\r"

Two patients received single agent BCNU chemotherapy for malignant gliomas. The third patient underwent combination radiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. Isolated case reports of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease following therapy for malignant disease are reviewed and clinical features summarized. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in this setting is thought to be rare. However, the diagnosis is rarely suspected clinically and is difficult to diagnose pathologically. Therefore, the true incidence of this complication is unknown and may be higher than believed. It is important that both clinician and pathologist be aware of this entity; otherwise, elastic tissue stains may not be performed and the diagnosis missed.\r"

The main indices of skeletal muscle cell energy metabolism, intracellular acid-base equilibrium and lactate metabolism were evaluated. Reduced ATP and phosphocreatine content, intracellular acidosis related to hypercapnia, increased muscle lactate without alterations of the muscle lactate concentration gradient were observed in the skeletal muscle of the hypercapnic-hypoxemic COPD patients studied, in which group no correlation was found between hypoxia and energy or lactate metabolism parameters. These results suggest that an overall derangement of cell energy metabolism and acid-base equilibrium is present in severely hypercapnic-hypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that in this condition skeletal muscle seems to metabolize anaerobically-even though, in addition to hypoxia, other factors interfering with both cell energy and lactate metabolism are likely to be present.\r"

Out of 3,815 cases of resected primary lung cancer, the incidence of multiple primary lung cancers was 0.8 percent. There were ten synchronous cases and 20 metachronous cases. Seventeen cases were unilateral, and 13 cases were bilateral, of which only one case was synchronous, and the remaining 12 cases were postoperative resection of an opposite lesion. Among the ten synchronous cases, four cases of multiple primary lung cancers were definitely diagnosed before surgery by chest x-ray films or fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Among the 20 metachronous cases, 11 cases were definitely diagnosed before surgery as the second primary lesion by chest x-ray films taken during periodic follow-ups after the initial resection, while nine cases were proven by thoracotomy. All of the 15 cases definitely diagnosed before surgery as multiple primary lung cancers were according to our criteria. Histologically, adenocarcinoma was relatively scarce, at a rate of 13 percent (4/30); but epidermoid carcinoma was predominant, at a rate of 87 percent (26/30), of which 11 cases were accompanied by adenocarcinoma or large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. The average postoperative survival in the ten synchronous cases was 29 months and in the 20 metachronous cases was 26.2 months, counting from the time of the second operation. The criteria of clinicopathologic findings, early diagnostic procedure, and surgery for multiple primary lung cancers were also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the fact that endotracheal intubation is a skill essential for clinicians of varied specialties, the procedure is not without risk, especially when practiced in an emergency setting, particularly the field environment. Of all complications, none is more serious than unrecognized esophageal intubation. Clinical experience with a method of guided orotracheal intubation using a rigid-wire lighted stylet prompted us to develop a technique to confirm correct intratracheal placement of an endotracheal tube using a new flexible lighted stylet designed for nasotracheal intubation. Endotracheal tubes were placed under direct vision at three sites in the upper airway of five unembalmed human cadavers: esophagus (20 cm from the teeth), trachea (20 cm from the teeth) and the right or left pyriform fossa. Thirty-five volunteer intubators were asked to identify tube placement using the transilluminated glow from the flexible nasotracheal lighted stylet. A total of 168 placements were made in 40 trials. Only one of 56 intratracheal placements was misidentified as esophageal. Of 112 extratracheal placements (esophagus or pyriform fossa), one was misidentified as intratracheal. The level of experience or training bore no relationship to the ability of the intubator to identify correct placement. We conclude from the study that this technique is a rapid and reliable method of confirming correct placement of endotracheal tubes. The use of this method could reduce, if not eliminate, unrecognized esophageal intubation in the field, emergency department, the critical care unit, and the operating room.\r"

Followup of 80 cases of pleural effusion up to nine months, in 55 cases up to one year, and up to two years in 30 cases after completion of therapy, showed no recurrence. In the cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis, resolution of lymph nodes occurred in 31 cases (68.8 percent) at the end of nine months of treatment. Therapy had to be extended for varying periods for achieving successful response, and in five cases, medical treatment had to be supplemented with surgical drainage and excision of the nodes. Short course chemotherapy can be used to treat pleural effusion, but the same mode of treatment is less effective for cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis.\r"

By discontinuing beta-blocking agents and introducing captopril, he felt much better, became pleasant and talkative, and blood pressure was well controlled. Beta antagonists are important drugs in the management of many cardiovascular problems. Propranolol, a lipophilic beta-blocking agent, and atenolol, a hydrophilic beta-blocking agent, are two of the major agents currently used clinically in the United States.

We investigated: (1) the relationship between the electrogastrogram (EGG) signals and gastric contractions elicited by barium meals and (2) the effects of barium meals on frequency and amplitude of EGG signals. As documented by fluoroscopy in four healthy subjects, barium meals stimulated three per minute gastric peristalsis which corresponded with simultaneously recorded three cycle per minute (cpm) EGG waves. Eighteen other healthy volunteers ingested 45% (w/v) or 60% barium suspensions. As determined by Fourier analysis, the dominant EGG frequency before barium was 3 cpm in 16 subjects; two subjects had no distinct frequency peaks. After barium ingestion, the mean amplitude or power at 3 cpm and 1 cpm increased, but the increase was significant only after 45% barium. In conclusion: (1) individual EGG waves after barium reflect gastric peristaltic sequences, which are reflected in increases in amplitude or power of 3 cpm EGG activity; (2) density or viscosity of the barium meal affects the gastric myoelectric response; and (3) mechanical correlates of 1 cpm EEG activity are unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids on biliary lipid secretion have only been studied experimentally, and quantitative data in patients are lacking. Therefore, biliary lipid secretion during steady-state meal perfusion of the duodenum was studied in six patients with partial ileocolectomy, five patients with Crohn's disease, and five normal subjects. Bile acid outputs in the resection patients were significantly lower than in normal controls, (6.87 +/- 2.10 mmol/6 hr and 13.5 +/- 2.16, respectively; P less than 0.001) and were also decreased in two of the five Crohn's disease patients. Bile acid outputs in patients with resection progressively decreased in the course of the perfusion study; phospholipid and cholesterol secretion did not decrease to the same extent, and cholesterol saturation gradually increased. Bile of these patients, therefore, was frequently supersaturated due to uncoupling of bile acid secretion and outputs of the other biliary lipids. Bile acid outputs, although decreased, did not reach very low values, which shows that the enterohepatic circulation was not totally interrupted. Chenodeoxycholic acid was the main bile acid component of bile in patients with ileocolonic resection. Deoxycholic acid was absent from bile of four resected patients and two Crohn's patients. Two patients with active Crohn's disease had low bile acid outputs despite only moderate fecal bile acid losses. Therefore, decreased outputs may be caused by decreased bile acid pool not compensated for by increased bile acid synthesis in severely ill patients.\r"

A total of 270 patients underwent 280 colonoscopies, of these, there were 105 patients that had 111 polypectomies. Blood cultures were taken prior to and within 15 min following each procedure. Six of 280 (2.1%) preprocedural blood cultures were positive. Seven of 169 (4%) blood cultures were positive within 15 min of insertion of the colonoscope in the colonoscopy only group. Eight of 223 (3.6%) blood cultures were positive within 10 min of the polypectomy. There was no clinical evidence of sepsis during the 24 hr following these procedures. In order to determine appropriate postprocedural sampling intervals, we induced a Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia with a mean of 1.16 X 10(6) colony forming units/ml on 10 occasions in seven dogs. Within 30 min of inoculation, we were able to detect only one colony forming unit/ml. The rate of positive blood cultures during colonoscopy alone and following polypectomy during colonoscopy is comparable to other gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. The most optimal time to collect blood cultures in order to detect transient bacteremia is as soon after the procedure as is feasibly possible.\r"

A new method for measuring the velocity profile of the leading edge of a radionuclide bolus has been developed and applied to boluses of different viscosity--water and treacle--in nine normal volunteers. The results show that the more viscous bolus (treacle) acquires a slower initial \"injection\" velocity (152 mm/sec vs 236 mm/sec) that only propels it over the proximal half of the esophagus. Peristaltic action must drive the bolus over the distal half. With water boluses, however, the higher initial velocity is sufficient to propel a part of the bolus at least to the gastroesophageal junction leaving minimal \"work\" to be performed by esophageal peristalsis. This confirms the important role of the pharyngeal pump in deglutition. The pump may be the major mechanism for ingestion of nonviscous liquids (water), peristalsis merely being required to \"sweep up\" what remains in the esophagus.\r"

To study the pathogenetic role of these organisms in duodenal ulcer, endoscopic biopsies, two from the first part of duodenum, four from antrum, and four from body and fundus, were taken before and after four weeks of cimetidine treatment (1.2 g/day) from 67 patients with active duodenal ulcer. The biopsies were examined for the presence and severity of any inflammation by two independent pathologists in the absence of any clinical information and for the occurrence and density of Campylobacter pyloridis by culture and Warthin-Starry stain. Before treatment, inflammation was present in 71.1, 100, and 25.8%, while the organisms were present in 34.3, 91.0, and 79.1% of the duodenal, antral, and fundal biopsies, respectively. With complete healing of duodenal ulcer, inflammation was present in 48.9, 98.2, and 30.2%, while the organisms were present in 25, 76.7, and 63.3% of the respective mucosae. With ulcer healing, duodenitis became significantly milder (P less than 0.05). With improvement of gastritis and duodenitis, there was no significant change in the occurrence and density of Campylobacter pyloridis. These findings indicate that healing of duodenal ulcer is not influenced by the presence of Campylobacter pyloridis, which is frequently found in the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with duodenal ulcer, but does not appear to be associated with mucosal inflammation except in the antrum.\r"

Both cimetidine and ranitidine suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated gastric secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Cold restraint-induced lesion formation was not prevented with doses of both agents that inhibited acid secretion by 75%. Doses which suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion more than 90% significantly prevented the development of gastric mucosal lesions produced by cold restraint. Doses of both H2 blockers which demonstrated significant suppression of lesion formation had no effect on cold restraint-stimulated gastric contractility. We conclude that cimetidine and ranitidine suppress cold restraint-induced lesion formation by suppressing acid secretion and not by suppressing gastric contractility.\r"

Human growth hormone (hGH) and human growth hormone releasing factor (hGHRF) stimulate growth of the gastrointestinal tract; however, the diabetogenic actions of growth hormone limit its usefulness in clinical practice. Plerocercoid larvae of the tapeworm Spirometra mansonoides produce an analog of hGH void of diabetogenic side effects. We assessed effects of plerocercoid growth factor (PGF) on mucosal adaptation following 70% proximal jejunoileal resection in young rats. Mucosal weight, DNA, protein, and total sucrase activity per centimeter of bowel were increased in resected PGF-treated animals compared to resected controls. We conclude PGF augments intrinsic postresection mucosal hyperplasia following extensive intestinal resection.\r"

FSCs from CCl4-treated rats contained a small number of lipid droplets and an abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), while those from vitamin A-treated rats showed numerous large lipid droplets and scanty RER. The population doubling times of FSCs isolated from normal, CCl4-treated, and vitamin A-treated rats were 38 +/- 4.3, 24 +/- 2.5, and 48 +/- 6.3 hr, respectively. The rate of collagen synthesis by FSCs from CCl4-treated rats was four- to sixfold enhanced, while collagen synthesis by FSCs from vitamin A-treated rats was suppressed. The ratio of collagen type I to type III produced by FSCs from CCl4 rats was enhanced as compared with control rats (94.7:5.3 vs 87.6:12.4). Therefore, FSCs can be considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.\r"

TNF alpha at 100-100,000 U/ml stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, an effect that appeared after 24 h of treatment and lasted 96 h. Transient (24-h) treatment with TNF alpha increased [3H]proline incorporation into type I collagen 24-72 h after the factor was removed; this effect was DNA synthesis dependent and blocked by hydroxyurea. Transient treatment with TNF alpha also increased alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, continuous treatment with TNF alpha for 48-96 h caused a marked inhibition on [3H]proline incorporation into type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase activity. TNF alpha caused a small increase in collagen degradation. Lymphotoxin had similar effects to those of TNF alpha. In conclusion, TNF alpha stimulates calvarial DNA synthesis which causes an increased number of collagen-synthesizing cells, but TNF alpha has a direct inhibitory effect on osteoblastic function.\r"

We have examined these variables in wild male baboons living undisturbed in their natural habitat in the Serengeti Ecosystem of East Africa. Among socially subordinate males, HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I concentrations were significantly reduced by 31% and 25%, respectively, compared to concentrations in dominant individuals. There were no social rank differences in VLDL + LDL-C or its apolipoprotein (Apo B). Differences in age, sex hormone concentrations, rank-related diet, body weight, or gene pools were unlikely to explain this rank-related pattern. However, diminished HDL-C concentrations were associated with elevated basal cortisol concentrations, suggesting that exposure of subordinate individuals to elevated levels of social stressors could cause lower HDL-C concentrations.\r"

Angiotensinogen gene expression in brown adipose tissue was confirmed by both Northern blot analysis and cell-free translation of RNA extracted from brown adipose tissue. For control rats, the level of angiotensinogen mRNA of brown adipose tissue, quantitated by Northern blot analysis, was 5% of the level in liver and showed a 12-fold increase in response to treatment with the combination of dexamethasone, ethynylestradiol, and T3. Comparison of the relative amounts of angiotensinogen mRNA detected by hybridization in situ in liver and brown adipose tissue, with the amounts determined by Northern blot analysis, revealed that hybridization in situ detected mRNA in brown adipose tissue with higher efficiency than in liver. These results suggest a role for angiotensinogen gene expression in brown adipose tissue function. In addition, these studies show that tissue-specific factors may modify the efficiency of detection of tissue mRNA using hybridization in situ.\r"

  ".W": "Specimens obtained during the course of efforts to purify the TSH receptor in guinea pig fat cell membranes solubilized with Triton X-100 displayed extensive loss of TSH binding activity, analogous to that seen by others during the purification of the TSH receptor in thyroid membranes. Therefore, as a preliminary to efforts to purify the TSH receptor in solubilized fat cell membranes (SFCM), experiments were undertaken to ascertain the factors responsible for this loss of binding activity and to find means for its prevention. Temperature proved to be the most important variable. SFCM stored at -70 C retained their activity with respect to the binding of bovine TSH (bTSH) for months, but binding activity was rapidly lost during storage of SFCM at 4 C, a loss due to a decrease in receptor number rather than binding affinity. Loss of binding activity during storage of SFCM at 4 C was unaffected by the addition of 1 mM cystine and was only slightly and temporarily retarded by a mixture of three protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin). These results indicated that loss of TSH receptors during storage at 4 C is not due to reduction of disulfide bonds or to proteolytic degradation. On the other hand, activity of the receptor was largely or entirely preserved during at least a week of storage at 4 C by the formation of a TSH-TSH receptor complex, by the addition of 40-50% glycerol either during solubilization or immediately thereafter, or by lyophilization immediately after solubilization. Receptors preserved by these three measures retained their original affinity for bTSH and their response to the TSH binding inhibitory activity of Graves'-immunoglobulin G. In the light of these results, SFCM were prepared in 40% glycerol and then subjected to TSH-affinity gel chromatography. The resulting materials contained at least 29.3% of the original binding activity, and their specific TSH binding activity was increased 227-fold. Saturation analysis of [125I]bTSH binding to this preparation revealed an association constant (Ka) (2.2 x 10(9) M-1), very similar to that in the original SFCM preparation. Binding of [125I]bTSH was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Graves'-immunoglobulin G, and in multiple preparations of the latter, TSH binding inhibitory activity measured in the affinity-purified receptor preparation was closely correlated with that measured in SFCM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

GH was administered in doses of 0.5, 2.0, and 8.0 mg/kg body weight/day. In the first part of the experiment, treatment with b-hGH started 7 days before implantation of the sponges, in the second part at the day of implantation, and for the 2.0 mg also 2 days before implantation. When b-hGH treatment was started 7 days before implantation, collagen deposition, maximum stress, and maximum stiffness were increased in the sponges from all the hormone-treated groups. In the group treated with 2.0 mg b-hGH/kg body weight.day, also an increase in failure energy was found. When b-hGH treatment was started at the day of implantation or 2 days before implantation, no differences in collagen deposition and biomechanical parameters were found. B-hGH treatment resulted in an increased weight gain in all three groups in the period before implantation, but only 8.0 mg b-hGH/kg body weight resulted in an increased weight gain during the following implantation period. The groups starting hormone treatment at the day of implantation showed an increased weight gain during the implantation period. The study shows that mechanical strength and collagen formation in sc implanted cellulose sponges in rats are increased by b-hGH when treatment is started 7 days before implantation with a maximum increase at a dose of 2.0 mg b-hGH/kg body weight.day.\r"

The cytosolic PR concentration was low in tumors grown in the absence of 17 beta-estradiol, but increased rapidly upon estrogen administration, reaching a maximal receptor concentration of 1.4-1.6 pmol/mg cytosol protein within 7 days. Protein blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (hPRa 1) raised against PR from EnCa 101 showed no immunoreactivity in tumors grown in the absence of estrogen. Immunoreactive proteins of mol wt 116,000 and 81,000 were detectable 8 h after estrogen administration and increased in intensity as the cytosolic PR concentration increased. Interestingly, the protein of mol wt 116,000 was composed of mol wt isoforms and was detectable as a doublet 8 h after estrogen administration and finally as a triplet. The effect of estrogen withdrawal on EnCa 101 PR concentration and structure was determined by removal of 17 beta-estradiol pellets (200 pg/ml plasma) from EnCa 101-bearing animals after achievement of maximal tumor PR concentrations. The PR concentration in tumor cytosols decreased in a biphasic manner after estrogen removal, with the initial rapid phase having a half-life of around 2 days. Cytosolic PR was still detectable 21 days after estrogen withdrawal. Protein blot analysis showed that immunoreactive proteins of mol wt 116,000 and 81,000 were also detectable up to that time. Photoaffinity labeling with [3H]R5020 demonstrated that the 81,000 mol wt protein, as well as each of the triplet proteins at mol wt 116,000, was specifically photoaffinity labeled. The 116,000-mol wt protein was detected as a triplet on protein blots until 13 days after estrogen withdrawal, when diminution in the intensity of the highest mol wt triplet protein was noted.\r"

  ".U": "88029234\r", 
  ".W": "In the U937 human monoblastoid cell line, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3] through a specific interaction with the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor promotes differentiation toward a more mature phenotype. In addition to this direct effect, 1,25(OH)2D3 also potentiates differentiation in response to lymphokines and (Bu)2cAMP. We examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on phorbol ester-stimulated differentiation. Either preincubation with or simultaneous exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced phorbol ester-stimulated differentiation. Over a 72-h period, the increase in phorbol ester responsiveness was dependent on the duration of 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure. Enhancement of phorbol ester-induced differentiation was observed with 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations ranging from 0.1-10 nM. The 1,25(OH)2D3 vitamin D metabolite was more potent than the 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites in potentiating phorbol ester-induced differentiation. Phorbol esters can exert at least a portion of their effects on cellular function by activating protein kinase C. Thus, one mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 could amplify signal transduction leading to potentiation of phorbol ester-stimulated differentiation would be by enhancing phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation. To examine this possibility, we measured protein kinase C-dependent substrate phosphorylation in extracts derived from cells pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3. In extracts derived from cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous U937 substrates stimulated by calcium, phosphatidyl serine, and diolein was increased compared to that observed in vehicle-treated cells. The conditions required for 1,25(OH)2D3 to increase protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous substrates (concentration, duration of exposure, and metabolite specificity) were similar to those required to enhance phorbol ester-stimulated differentiation. Possibly mediating this enhanced phosphorylation was an increase in protein kinase C activity observed in extracts derived from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells.\r"

Treatment with 25(s),26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (20 micrograms/day for 1 week) caused a marked and significant fall in the circulating concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (16 +/- 5 SEM vs. 28 +/- 4 pg/ml, P = 0.02). This reduction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was dependent on the dose of 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administered since a 5 micrograms/day dosing regimen failed to alter serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Despite the 25-66% reduction in circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration produced by 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 therapy, serum calcium and intestinal calcium absorption remained normal. These results suggested that 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D has a weak agonist action or that a further metabolite that stimulates bone calcium resorption and/or intestinal calcium absorption is formed. Rats predosed with 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (20 micrograms/day) for 4 days and subsequently dosed with both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.15 micrograms/day) and 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for an additional 3 days, demonstrated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels significantly higher than that found for control rats (47 +/- 5 vs. 25 +/- 4 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) but significantly reduced from the value observed for rats receiving only 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (47 +/- 5 vs. 187 +/- 38 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has a previously unrecognized action in affecting the metabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\r"

A variety of potential growth factors and culture procedures (such as feeder layers, extracellular matrices, collagen gels, and growth from tissue explants) were examined for their ability to support androgen action. Testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone were only able to induce seminal vesicle secretory protein synthesis in the presence of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenaline, or serotonin). The mechanism of this permissive effect of neurotransmitters on androgenic induction has been examined. It is not related to their mitogenic activity since other mitogens (epidermal growth factor and corticosterone) did not facilitate androgen action. Agents that raise intracellular cAMP were also ineffective so cAMP is probably not involved, but the phosphatidyl inositol pathway may be important.\r"

  ".W": "Fecal and urinary excretion rates of six iodothyronines were assessed in the rat maintained under normal steady state physiological conditions, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of control of normal thyroid hormone economy and metabolism. Groups of young adult male rats were injected with trace doses of T4, T3, rT3, 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2), 3',5'-T2, or 3'-monoiodothyronine, each labeled with 125I, and feces and urine were collected separately for up to 10 days. Pooled fecal pellets were homogenized in saline, extracted in ethanol, evaporated under vacuum, and reconstituted in NaOH. Fecal extracts and urine were chromatographed on Sephadex G25 columns under conditions providing quantitative separations of components of interest. A new technique was also developed, based on a model of the in vitro extraction and measurement process, to correct chromatographic results for possible variable recoveries and possible artifactious degradation of radioactively labeled components. No iodothyronines or their conjugates were excreted in urine; all radioactivity was in the form of iodide. In feces, about 30% of the [125I]T3 injected was excreted as T3; and 24% of the [125I]T4 injected was excreted as T4, plus 4% as T3. Together, these results imply that about 24% of endogenous T4 production is excreted as T4 and 76% is irreversibly metabolized; and for T3, about 30% of endogenous T3 production is excreted as T3 and 70% is degraded. For the nonhormonal iodothyronines, about 6% of injected monoiodothyronine, 3% of injected 3',5'-T2, 2% of injected 3,3'-T2, and less than 1% of injected rT3 were excreted in feces as such, indicating that these substances are nearly completely deiodinated in vivo. Very little (1-7%) iodide was excreted as such in feces, which also were devoid of measurable conjugates. An open question is whether the substantial wastage of thyroid hormones in feces represents poor hormone economy in the usually accepted sense or a functional property of overall thyroid hormone regulation.\r"

Young female rats, maintained on a 14:10 light-dark cycle were ovariectomized. One week later, half of them were outfitted sc with Silastic capsules containing estradiol. Groups of animals were decapitated 2 days later at 0300, 1000, 1300, 1500, 1800, and 2300 h. Brains were removed, frozen, and sectioned at 20 micron. Sections were incubated with [3H]prazosin in Tris-HCl buffer, washed, dried, and exposed to LKB Ultrofilm. The densities of alpha 1-receptors were quantitated using a computerized image analysis system. In ovariectomized rats, the density of alpha 1-receptors exhibited a diurnal rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), and pineal gland. In SCN and MPN, receptor concentrations were lowest during the middle of the day and rose to peak levels at 1800 h. In the pineal gland, the density of alpha 1-receptors was lowest at middark phase, rose to peak levels before lights on, and remained elevated during the day. Estradiol suppressed the density of alpha 1 binding sites in the SCN, MPN, median eminence, ventromedial nucleus, and the pineal gland but had no effect on the lateral septum. Estrogen treatment altered the rhythm of receptor densities in MPN, median eminence, and the pineal gland. In MPN, a transient suppression in the density of receptors occurred at 1500 h, a time associated with increased norepinephrine turnover and the onset of the LH surge. Therefore, we conclude that alpha 1-receptor densities undergo a diurnal rhythm in brain regions associated with entrainment to the photoperiod. Estrogen alters the rhythm of alpha 1-receptors in areas involved with the regulation of LH secretion and decreases the density in other estrogen-responsive regions.\r"

  ".W": "Our laboratory has reported previously the cloning of a complementary DNA termed pS2, corresponding to a messenger RNA (mRNA) whose synthesis is induced by estrogen in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. Examination of the possible open reading frames of this complementary DNA has led to the prediction that the pS2 protein could be a secreted polypeptide of either 58 or 63 amino acids in length. Using a rabbit antiserum prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 31 amino acids of the putative protein, we show that a protein with the expected migration during sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis can indeed be immunoprecipitated from either the culture medium of MCF-7 cells grown in the presence of labeled amino acids or the in vitro translation products of MCF-7 poly(A) RNA enriched in pS2 mRNA. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro differential amino acid labeling allows us to conclude that the mature pS2 protein is probably secreted as a 58 amino acid long peptide. Finally, we show that pS2 protein synthesis is induced in MCF-7 cells by estradiol and phenol red, but not by the antiestrogen tamoxifen, in keeping with our previous results demonstrating estrogen induction of pS2 mRNA synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "88029249\r", 
  ".W": "Melanotropin (MSH) receptor activity in the M2R mouse melanoma cell line is tightly controlled by calcium by an unknown mechanism. The possibility that calcium regulation is mediated by calmodulin or a calmodulin-related calcium binding protein has been addressed in this report by studying the effects of two known calmodulin antagonists, fluphenazine and melittin, on MSH receptor function. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) in M2R plasma membranes by beta MSH was strongly inhibited by both antagonists. The concentrations of fluphenazine and melittin yielding half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of AC were 16 microM and 2.4 microM, respectively. Both fluphenazine and melittin also inhibit prostaglandin E1-, GTP gamma S, and forskolin-stimulated AC activity, as well as that of unstimulated enzyme, although inhibition is shown to occur at significantly higher concentrations of antagonist. We have shown that the calcium-dependent rate-limiting step in MSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase, that of hormone binding, is strongly inhibited by these antagonists at concentrations identical to, if not lower than, those required for the inhibition of AC activity (fluphenazine-IC50, 14 microM; melittin-IC50, 0.7 microM). The actions of these antagonists, furthermore, appear to be calcium insensitive, as melittin affects the stability of both the high affinity (calcium containing) and low affinity (calcium depleted) receptor-MSH complexes. The sensitivity of the MSH receptor to inhibition by calmodulin antagonists resembles that described for purified calmodulin-sensitive enzyme systems, which suggests a possible role for calmodulin in MSH receptor function. Among peptide hormone receptors, this effect by calmodulin antagonists appears to be unique for the MSH receptor.\r"

Striking regional heterogeneity of ER location was observed. In the urinary tract, specific ER staining was confined to nuclei of the transitional epithelium (mucosa) and subjacent stroma (submucosa) of the prostatic urethra in the male dog and of the proximal urethra in the female dog. In both sexes there was a gradient of ER staining intensity along these urethral segments. In the male, ER staining intensity was highest in the region of the verumontanum. The pattern and intensity of staining were similar in the male prostatic urethra and female proximal urethra, indicating a similar concentration of ER in these tissues, which have the same embryological origin. No specific staining was found in the kidney, ureter, bladder, or distal urethra of either sex. In the normal prostate, specific immunocytochemical ER staining was confined to nuclei of the prostatic stroma and prostatic ductal epithelium. Specific staining intensity appeared to be higher in the periurethral region of the prostate than in the periphery. No specific staining was found in the acinar epithelium of the prostate. Based on overall staining intensity there appeared to be a higher concentration of ER in the urethra than in the prostate. Scatchard analysis of [3H]estradiol binding confirmed a similar ER content in the urethra of male and female dogs and a higher ER content in the prostatic urethra than in the prostate itself (P less than 0.001). The location of ER in the normal canine prostate and prostatic urethra is consistent with the location of histological changes induced by estrogen administration, indicating that these immunoreactive ER probably represent biologically functional receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We used immunocytochemistry (ICC) with monoclonal antibodies to the estrogen receptor (ER) to localize ER in the oviducts, uteri, and cervix of untreated, estrogen-treated, and estrogen-progestin-treated spayed macaques. We also used binding assays with labeled estrogens to quantify nuclear and cytosolic ER levels in parallel samples of the same tissues. In untreated spayed animals, cytosolic ER levels were much higher than nuclear ER levels, but all specific staining was nuclear. After treatment for 14 days with estradiol (E2), the degree of staining for ER in cell nuclei in the oviduct, cervix, and endometrium had increased, and there were significant increases in both nuclear and cytosolic ER levels. In the myometrium, ER levels and ICC staining of nuclei increased minimally with E2 treatment. In animals treated for 2 weeks with E2 followed by 2 weeks with E2 and progesterone (P; sequential P treatment) the degree of nuclear ER staining in the oviduct, endometrium, and cervix greatly decreased, and cytosolic and nuclear levels of ER declined significantly. In the myometrium of such animals there was a minimal decrease in the degree of staining and a nonsignificant decline in cytosolic and nuclear ER levels. Sequential P treatment reduced the degree of nuclear staining in the oviduct and endometrium below that found in spayed animals; however, such treatment only lowered the amount of cytosolic, not nuclear, ER significantly below spayed levels in those same tissues. Some animals were treated sequentially with P and sampled 1, 3, 12, and 24 h after the onset of P treatment. By 1 h, nuclear ER levels in the endometrium were significantly suppressed, but cytosolic levels were not lowered until 3 h of treatment; ICC staining was also not substantially reduced until 3 h of P treatment. In the oviduct, nuclear ER levels were significantly reduced by 1 h of P treatment, but cytosolic levels were not lowered until after 12-24 h of P treatment; the degree of nuclear staining in the oviduct was also not substantially reduced until 12-24 h of P treatment. In myometrium, there was no significant decline in ER in nuclear or cytosolic fractions or any substantial decrease in the degree of nuclear staining at any time during this treatment. These observations suggest that the ER detected by ICC in the nuclei of target cells in frozen sections represents the total ER detectable by binding assays in cytosolic and nuclear fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin and its mRNA in the male rat is dependent on androgen, glucocorticoid, T4, insulin, and GH. Some of these hormones may act directly on the liver, while others may influence alpha 2u-globulin synthesis through indirect physiological changes. In the present study the specific role of androgen in the synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin was examined in an in vitro liver perfusion system. The addition of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to the medium perfused through livers from castrated rats resulted in a rapid increase (approximately 10-fold over the vehicle control within 120 min) in the circulating level of alpha 2u globulin. Labeling with [35S]-methionine showed that the androgen-mediated increase in the circulating level of alpha 2u-globulin is due to release of the newly synthesized protein. Quantification of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA in the perfused livers with and without androgen supplementation indicated that the increased mRNA level can only partially account for the elevation of the circulating level of this protein. From these results it is concluded that androgen can act directly on the liver to stimulate alpha 2u-globulin synthesis, and the hormone may influence more than one regulatory step.\r"

The same treatment administered to hypophysectomized-gonadectomized rats and androgen-insensitive Tfm rats induces alpha 2u-globulin mRNA to a level of only 5-10% of that in the normal male. However, none of these types of animals shows an appreciable response when GH is administered continuously through osmotic minipumps. Perfusion of the livers derived from hypophysectomized male rats with the blood from hypothyroid rabbits (also deficient in GH) was used to examine in vitro effects of GH on alpha 2u-globulin synthesis. Supplementation of the perfusion medium with GH and T4 failed to induce alpha 2u-globulin within the perfusion period of 120 min. These results show that GH can influence alpha 2u-globulin synthesis independent of the androgen and that the mode of administration of GH plays an important role in its biological response.\r"

The biological actions of plerocercoid growth factor (PGF) suggest structural similarity to human GH (hGH). Plerocercoid membranes were solubilized, and PGF was purified more than 1000-fold by hGH receptor affinity chromatography. The ability of purified PGF to displace [125I]hGH from monoclonal antibodies specific for four distinct nonoverlapping antigenic determinants of hGH and from an anti-hGH polyclonal antibody was tested in liquid phase RIA. All of the hGH antibodies cross-reacted with PGF, with potencies ranging from more than 60% to less than 1% that of the hGH standard. Of the four major epitopes of hGH defined by the monoclonal antibodies used in this study, only one is not represented to a significant extent in PGF. The epitope of hGH that is only marginally present in PGF is highly conformationally dependent, and a minor difference in the structure of PGF (compared to hGH) could result in a significant conformational change. The dramatic cross-reactivity between anti-hGH antibodies and PGF suggests that the similarities in biological activities between these two substances are based in significant molecular homology.\r"

To determine its possible sites of action, we examined the distribution of alpha MSH receptors in a variety of tissues in mice and rats. The superpotent and enzymatically resistant alpha MSH analog, Nle4,D-Phe7-alpha MSH (NDP-MSH), was radioiodinated using lactoperoxidase (Enzymobeads) and purified by reverse phase chromatography for use as a tracer. [125I]NDP-MSH exhibited consistent and specific binding to cultured B16 and Cloudman S91 murine melanoma cells, which are highly responsive to alpha MSH. The tracer had full biological activity, as determined by its potency in stimulating melanogenesis in B16 cells. To study receptor distribution in vivo, [125I]NDP-MSH was administered iv to C3H/HeJ (pigmented) mice and Sprague-Dawley (albino) rats. To determine the specificity of tracer uptake by tissues, some animals received a large molar excess of alpha MSH together with [125I]NDP-MSH. Data were expressed as tissue to plasma radioactivity concentration ratios. In mice, specific (i.e. alpha MSH-inhibitable) binding of [125I]NDP-MSH was found in a number of glandular organs, including lacrimal, Harderian, preputial, submandibular, and adrenal glands and pancreas, as well as in brown and white adipose tissues, bladder, duodenum, skin, spleen, and hypothalamus. In rats, results were generally similar; specific tracer uptake was observed in lacrimal, Harderian, preputial, and thyroid glands; pancreas, duodenum, spleen, hypothalamus; and white adipose tissue. These results show that specific receptors for alpha MSH are widely distributed, suggesting that alpha MSH may affect the functions of a number of organs.\r"

  ".W": "An intraperitoneal inflammatory process has been associated with infertility in women without anatomic distortion of the pelvic viscera, particularly with endometriosis. This phenomenon was investigated by measuring peritoneal fluid (PF) and serum levels of a major secretory product of the macrophage, lysozyme, in fertile and infertile women undergoing laparoscopy. Serum lysozyme levels were in the normal range and did not correlate with total PF lysozyme. Regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between adnexal adhesions and PF volume (P less than 0.05), PF leukocyte number (P less than 0.05), and total PF lysozyme (P less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found between total PF lysozyme and PF volume (r = 0.72, P less than 0.0001) and leukocyte number (r = 0.67, P less than 0.0001). These results suggest that a localized intraperitoneal inflammatory reaction is associated with infertility in the absence of anatomic distortion of the pelvic viscera.\r"

Commercial sources of human and bovine albumen tested did not preserve motility as well as serum, but addition to serum showed that the lesser effect was probably due to toxic contaminants. One of the most commonly available disposable plastic syringes was found to be markedly toxic to sperm. The materials found to have sperm toxicity also manifested toxicity to mouse embryos. These findings show that a similar degree of caution is advisable in testing of materials contacting sperm in vitro to that which has become standard practice for culture of human embryos.\r"

Two parallel groups of in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients possessing sperm density of this category had their sperm capacitated by MT-SU or ST-SU. The MT-SU patients' sperm fertilized 71 +/- 6.0% of eggs retrieved in comparison to 39 +/- 7.9% in the parallel ST-SU patients (P less than 0.001). Similarly, MT-SU increased the rate of human sperm penetration into zona-free hamster eggs. The increased fertilization rate of MT-SU sperm was not from acceleration of the acrosome reaction, but may be attributed to the higher efficiency of MT-SU in removing antifertility factors present in the seminal plasma from sperm.\r"

In both groups, measurable amounts of the respective drug were found in all FF aspirates. Within individual patients, plasma concentrations of both drugs declined during the period of sampling between initial and final follicular aspiration. The mean plasma drug concentration was 7.99 +/- 3.97 micrograms/ml in the thiamylal group and 4.13 +/- 0.90 micrograms/ml in the thiopental group. Mean drug concentrations in FF were similar in both groups (thiopental 1.62 +/- 0.61 micrograms/ml; thiamylal 1.67 +/- 0.83 micrograms/ml). The mean FF/plasma concentration ratio during the sampling period was greater in the thiopental group (0.41 +/- 0.19) as compared with the thiamylal group (0.22 +/- 0.14). Several steps in the clinical management of these patients can be taken to reduce exposure of oocytes to drugs used during anesthesia.\r"

Results of embryo culture experiments were generally found to correlate well with the outcome of IVF. Serum of patients whose oocytes were fertilized and developed to cleavage-stage embryos scored highest for embryotrophic parameters such as morphologic score and protein content of the mouse embryo. There was no significant difference in terms of serum embryotrophic activity between patients who became pregnant after embryo transfer and those who did not. When mouse embryos were cultured in serum from cycles with poor IVF results, i.e., oocytes failed to be fertilized or fertilized oocytes failed to cleave or cleave abnormally, significantly retarded embryonic growth and a higher incidence of malformed embryos were observed. However, in two cases where IVF failed as a result of poor semen quality, the patient's serum was found to be supportive of mouse embryonic development.\r"

In the present experiments, 2-cell mouse embryos were frozen under a wide range of conditions in an attempt to optimize their survival and viability in vitro and in vivo. The experiments show that embryos exposed briefly (2 to 2.5 minutes) to relatively high concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (3 to 4 M) and 0.25 M sucrose survive and develop when plunged directly into liquid nitrogen and thawed in a 37 degrees C waterbath when sealed in 0.25-ml plastic pailettes. Survival and viability rates of ultrarapidly frozen embryos after thawing were comparable to those obtained with conventional slow-freezing techniques. The authors believe that this freezing technique can be further improved and that the speed, ease, and low cost of the method make it a very attractive alternative to more conventional methods for freezing early cleavage stage embryos.\r"

It has been developed for its prognostic value of confirming fertilization in couples with oligospermia or asthenospermia and enabling fertilization in cases with antispermatozoal antibodies (ASAB). PROST has provided useful diagnostic information in the management of couples who have failed to conceive in other treatment programs and has particular advantages over IVF for those receiving fresh donated oocytes for ovarian failure. Fourteen pregnancies resulted from 52 transfers, providing a pregnancy rate of 27% per transfer. The pregnancy rates were higher than a matched IVF series in the male factor and female ASAB groups and reached statistical significance for the ovum donation group. It is anticipated that both pregnancy rates and fetal wastage will be improved over conventional IVF and embryo transfer for the described infertility groups.\r"

All media supported equal rates of blastocyst development from 2-cell embryos. In addition, there were no differences in the rates of blastocyst implantation. However, once implanted, blastocysts grown in T6 produced a significantly higher proportion of normal fetuses (58.5% to 65.9%) than blastocysts grown in either Ham's F-10 (2.4%) or T6 with FCS (27.6%). These results demonstrate that the rate of murine blastocyst development from 2-cell embryos in vitro is not a good criterion of healthy embryos. Murine blastocysts transferred in medium with 0% versus 50% FCS implanted and developed into normal fetuses at equal rates.\r"

While the horn weights (HW), BS, and EX of contralateral horns were not significantly different, the intra-animal variation of HW was 7.2%, BS was 17.7% and EX was 38.2%. In a second experiment, one uterine horn was divided and anastomosed, and the animal given estrogen supplementation or a placebo pellet. Estrogen administration was found to increase BS and EX of anastomosed horns prior to 14 days, but had no beneficial effect at 21 or 42 days. The data suggest that estrogen may be required for optimal early healing of genital tract wounds.\r"

In normal animals, many factors have been shown to regulate cholesterol synthesis in the small intestine, including changes in plasma cholesterol levels. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of lowering plasma cholesterol levels on small intestine cholesterol synthesis in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. In diabetic rats, 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4-APP)-induced hypocholesterolemia (plasma cholesterol levels less than 20 mg/dl) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in small intestine cholesterol synthesis, which was most marked in the distal small intestine, decreasing proximally. In the distal small intestine the incorporation of 3H2O into cholesterol was 0.28 +/- 0.04 mumol.h-1.g-1 in diabetic rats versus 1.60 +/- 0.38 in diabetic rats administered 4-APP (P less than .01). This stimulation of cholesterol synthesis occurred in the upper villus, middle villus, and crypt cells isolated from the middle intestine of the 4-APP-treated diabetic animals. In agreement with these observations, \"functional hypocholesterolemia\" due to Triton WR-1339 administration also stimulated cholesterol synthesis 2.5-fold in the small intestine of normal and diabetic animals. In the distal small intestine, cholesterol synthesis was 0.43 +/- 0.10 mumol.h-1.g-1 in the diabetic rats versus 1.08 +/- 0.21 in diabetic rats treated with Triton WR-1339 (P less than .05). In both the 4-APP and Triton WR-1339 experiments, the response of the diabetic rats was similar to that observed in normal rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, previous work by us showed no effect of physiologic insulin concentrations on LPL in isolated human adipocytes. To pursue further the regulation of LPL in vitro, primary cultures of isolated human adipocytes were prepared and exposed to glucose concentrations of 0-4.5 mg/ml. LPL activity was measured as activity secreted into the culture medium (CM), released from cells by heparin (HR), and extracted from cell digests (EXT). After 5 h in culture, a stimulatory effect of glucose on HR was observed. After 24 h there was a gradual increase in CM, HR, and EXT in parallel with increasing glucose concentrations of 0-1.0 mg/ml. At glucose concentrations greater than 1.0 mg/ml, however, there was a decrease in CM. At a glucose concentration of 4.5 mg/ml, CM was only 51 +/- 14% (P less than .02) of its value at glucose concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml. Cellular LPL (HR and EXT) was not affected by high glucose concentrations. Response of cellular LPL to the hormonal regulator insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was modulated by medium glucose. HR in cultures treated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I was 166 +/- 40 and 147 +/- 23% of HR in control cultures at glucose concentrations of 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively (P less than or equal to .05).

Nerves from animals made diabetic with streptozocin were incubated in vitro with [32P]orthophosphate and divided into segments from the proximal to the distal end, and proteins from each segment were then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The principal labeled species were the major myelin proteins, P0, and the basic proteins. After 6 wk of diabetes, the incorporation of isotope into these proteins rose as a function of distance along the nerve in a proximal to distal direction and was significantly higher at the distal end compared with incorporation into nerves from age-matched controls. The overall level of isotope uptake was similar in nerves from diabetic animals and weight-matched controls. The distribution of 32P among proteins also differed in diabetic nerve compared with both control groups in that P0 and the small basic protein accounted for a greater proportion of total label incorporated along the entire length of nerve. In contrast to intact nerve, there was no significant difference in protein phosphorylation when homogenates from normal and diabetic nerve were incubated with [32P]-gamma-ATP. The results suggest that abnormal protein phosphorylation, particularly of myelin proteins, is a feature of experimental diabetic neuropathy and that the changes are most pronounced in the distal portion of the nerve.\r"

Cells in S phase were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (an analogue of thymidine), and the cell-cycle position of the labeled cohort was analyzed by flow cytometry at successive time points. The movement of cells exposed to high glucose for 7-8 days was retarded both in S and G2 phases so that the increase in bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells over 24 h was 1.6-fold, versus 2.0-fold in control cultures. In experiments in which mitotic arrest with vinblastine was used to investigate the movement of cells out of G1 phase without interference from reentering cells, depletion of the G1 compartment was significantly inhibited in cultures grown in high glucose. The effects of chronic high glucose on cell cycle occurred while total protein synthesis was not diminished. Acute exposure to high glucose had no effect on cell-cycle traversal or cell generation time. Cell-cycle abnormalities observed in this study may relate to the DNA damage we have previously observed in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose and, if occurring in vivo, could be of pathogenetic importance for the vascular lesions and teratogenicity of diabetes.\r"

The concentrations of 7B2 in pancreatic islet tumors and in nesidioblastosis were investigated also. Significant quantities of 7B2-like immunoreactivity (IR-7B2) were found in all developmental stages studied. The highest concentrations of IR-7B2 were found at term [215.4 +/- 40.0 vs. 28.3 +/- 4.4 pmol/g (adult levels), P less than .001]. A high incidence of elevated IR-7B2 concentration in pancreatic islet tumors and nesidioblastosis was found (10 of 12 insulinomas, 5 of 8 glucagonomas, and in all 3 pancreases with nesidioblastosis). Gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-100 showed two immunoreactive peaks in all extracts studied. The main peak (Kav 0.30) of IR-7B2 corresponded to that found in the porcine pituitary gland. The high incidence of elevated IR-7B2 concentrations in pancreatic islet tumors and the increase in IR-7B2 concentrations in the term pancreas and particularly in nesidioblastosis suggest that the novel protein 7B2 may serve as an islet marker.\r"

The assay's features include 1) use of a physiologic amount of 125I-labeled insulin, 2) parallel incubations with supraphysiologic cold insulin (competitive), and 3) an incubation time of 7 days and a single-step multiple-wash polyethylene glycol separation. Mean +/- SE CIAA levels in 50 controls were 8 +/- 1.4 nU/ml (range -16-33.3). In 36 cytoplasmic islet cell antibody (ICA)-positive nondiabetic first-degree relatives of type I (insulin-dependent) patients less than 30 yr of age, CIAA levels exceeded the normal range in 20 (55.6%) of 36 (mean 86.8 +/- 17.1 nU/ml). In 26 ICA-positive relatives greater than 30 yr of age, only 5 (19.2%) of 26 exceeded the normal range (mean 26.1 +/- 9.4 nU/ml); P less than .001 compared with younger ICA-positive relatives). Six ICA-negative HLA-identical siblings of type I diabetic patients had normal CIAA levels (mean 3.6 +/- 5.8 nU/ml), and only 2 of 13 ICA-negative identical twins discordant for diabetes (mean 15.4 +/- 6.6 nU/ml) exceeded the normal range. Nine (50%) of 18 ICA-positive schoolchildren exceeded the normal range (mean 105.3 +/- 36.7 nU/ml). Genetically susceptible subjects negative for CIAA (with only 3 exceptions) remained negative for CIAA on multiple determinations (3 conversions observed), and CIAA levels of positive subjects were relatively stable. Linear regression of the first CIAA level versus last (interval between sampling 1 mo to 10 yr) in genetically susceptible individuals showed a highly significant correlation (r = .95, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The frequencies of apoE4-present phenotypes (apoE4/3, apoE4/4, and apoE4/2) were highest in the type IIa group (51.4%), followed by the type IIb group (38.1%) and the normolipidemic group (16.4%), respectively, whereas the frequency of the most common phenotype, apoE3/3, was lowest in the type IIa group (48.6%), followed by the type IIb group (61.9%) and the normolipidemic group (79.9%), respectively. There were significant differences in the apoE phenotype frequencies between the normolipidemic group and the type IIa and IIb groups. The frequency of the epsilon 4 allele was significantly higher in the type IIa (28.6%) and IIb (20.2%) groups than in the normolipidemic group (8.9%), whereas the frequency of the epsilon 3 allele was significantly lower in the type IIa (71.4%) and IIb (78.6%) groups than in the normolipidemic group (89.2%). The frequency of the epsilon 2 allele tended to be lower in diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia. In addition, these frequencies were also examined in nondiabetic subjects (n = 59). The frequency of the epsilon 4 allele tended to be higher in hypercholesterolemic diabetic subjects (24.1%) than in hypercholesterolemic nondiabetic subjects (15.3%). These data suggest that diabetic patients with the epsilon 4 allele may be more susceptible to hypercholesterolemia than diabetic patients without the epsilon 4 allele and possibly nondiabetic subjects with the epsilon 4 allele, although the underlying mechanism is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The early local exudative cellular reaction in an inflammatory lesion was impaired in alloxan-induced diabetic rats due to reduced migration of neutrophils to the inflamed area. Neutrophils, however, were capable of moving from reserve compartments into blood in these animals. Furthermore, the functional integrity of their surface membranes, assessed by the capacity of the cells to adhere to nylon fiber, was not altered by alloxan diabetes. An intrinsic cellular defect also did not occur, because the cells were capable of responding to chemotactic stimuli in the Boyden chamber system, provided they were suspended in Eagle's medium or normal serum. Suspended in the corresponding diabetic serum, a blockade of the chemotactic response was observed. Increasing concentrations of diabetic serum, added to a suspension containing neutrophils collected from normal donors, progressively inhibited the response of the cells to a chemotactic stimulus. Hyperglycemia alone or hyperosmolality secondary to hyperglycemia, the presence of ketone bodies, or a direct effect of alloxan did not explain the results. In addition, the capacity to generate chemotactic factors remained intact in diabetic serum. Pretreatment of the diabetic animals with insulin resulted in a gradual recovery of the chemotactic response in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that alloxan-induced diabetic rat serum contains a substance that inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and that insulin administration is essential for the clearance of this substance from plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Specific gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptors were characterized in human benign insulinoma plasma membranes employing [mono-[125I]iodo-Tyr10]-GIP (125I-GIP) as the radioligand. GIP 1-42 inhibited 125I-GIP binding with an IC50 value of 10(-9) M. Scatchard analysis showed two classes of binding sites: a high-affinity site (Kd = 2.23 x 10(-10) M; Bmax = 24 fmol/mg protein) and a low-affinity site (Kd = 8.39 x 10(-9) M; Bmax = 118 fmol/mg protein). A synthetic replicate of human GIP 1-31 inhibited 125I-GIP binding with an IC50 value of 10(-8) M. The GIP binding sites of human insulinoma were coupled to adenylate cyclase stimulation. GIP 1-31 regulated the adenylate cyclase activity to the same extent as GIP 1-42. The concentrations of GIP required for maximal activity ranged from 10(-9) to 10(-8) M for either GIP 1-42 or GIP 1-31. The existence of functional GIP receptors in human insulinoma substantiates our recent reports demonstrating the presence of GIP binding sites in transplantable hamster insulinoma and indicates that GIP could exert a direct control of the beta-cell function in humans through a purely endocrine pathway.\r"

There appeared to be considerable disagreement between general practitioners and internists about the necessity of the referrals from a biomedical view point and less so about the objective of the referrals. Twelve referrals were labelled as 'problem referrals'. Each of these was reviewed by the general practitioner and the internist who were involved in the referral in the presence of the author. In these meetings agreement was reached on the objective and the necessity of each of the 12 referrals. The evaluation, however, showed marked differences between general practitioners and internists with respect to the effect of the project: most general practitioners said that participation in the study influenced their conduct in referring patients to specialists, while most internists replied negatively.\r"

Doctors with a high recall rate, who asked more of their patients to return, saw more chronic illness and investigated their patients' illnesses more. They were more likely to visit their patients and to make two or more diagnoses, their second diagnosis having an even greater bias to chronic illness. When they did give a prescription it was likely to be for two or more items at a consultation. They involved the primary health care team more and their patients were more likely to be elderly, female and of a higher social class. The low recall doctors asked few patients to return, saw less chronic illness and more acute episodic types of illness. They were more likely to see their patients in surgery and make a single diagnosis and give either none or one prescription. They were less likely either to involve the primary health care team or to investigate their patients. Their patients were younger, male and of a lower social class. Personality, undergraduate education, and postgraduate training seemed to be major influences on these differing characteristics. The results have implications for partnership, individual doctors and patients in the provision of whole person medicine.\r"

The responses of 387 randomly selected Australian general practitioners to this measure are described. Overall, there was strong support for the importance of fostering patient participation, facilitating open communication and understanding, having a psychological orientation, and implementing preventive activities in general practice. However, the sample was strongly opposed to a government regulated health care system. Age and sex of the general practitioner were shown to influence orientations on some dimensions.\r"

Results from a community survey in north-east London are presented to show how the views about general practice among residents in a typical inner city district compared with those in a suburban area. The results suggest that while the respondents were generally satisfied with their doctor's practice, a significant minority were dissatisfied, particularly in the inner city. Some of the respondents' views seemed to differ from the model of desirable general practice suggested by the policy literature. In particular, single-handed practice was more popular with patients than group practice. The results reflect the importance to patients of good personal rapport and communication with their doctor, which seemed to them the most significant quality of general practice. The implications for policies to improve inner city practice are considered.\r"

Additional measures such as the number of nights interrupted by asthma, number of attacks and episodes of wheezing, indicated that 28.0%, 24.0% and 34.5% of the patients respectively were undertreated. It is concluded that asthma seems to be undertreated in general practice in The Netherlands, a finding which is consistent with research on this subject in the UK and other countries.

  ".W": "Seminal abnormalities are commonly found during sulphasalazine treatment. Although these changes appear reversible after drug withdrawal this may result in colitis relapse. Animal studies suggest that 5-aminosalicylic acid, the active component of sulphasalazine, does not impair fertility. Sixteen patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were studied. Each patient produced three samples of semen at weekly intervals. Of the 48 samples analysed 39.6% showed oligospermia, 41.7% showed an increased number of abnormal forms and 91.7% showed impaired motility. Nine patients substituted enteric coated mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) for sulphasalazine for a minimum period of three months. During this time one patient developed a salmonella associated colitis relapse; the others remained well. Improvement in sperm count (p less than 0.02), motility (p less than 0.001) and morphology (p less than 0.02) occurred in all cases. To date, four successful pregnancies have resulted, three in couples complaining of long term infertility. Treatment with enteric-coated mesalazine allows the recovery of seminal abnormalities induced by sulphasalazine in patients with colitis.\r"

  ".W": "Portal fibrosis is considered to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension associated with extrahepatic biliary obstruction. The histological features, however, include diffuse hepatocyte hyperplasia as well as portal fibrosis, but not cirrhosis, and it is possible that the contribution of hepatocyte hyperplasia in the initiation of portal hypertension is equally important. If so, we hypothesised that patients with biliary obstruction and a coincident condition such as liver atrophy, or hepatic resection, with the potential of accelerating the hepatocyte proliferation caused by biliary obstruction itself, might be expected to develop portal hypertension earlier than patients with biliary obstruction alone. To examine this concept we studied 10 patients with postcholecystectomy bile duct stricture, portal hypertension and liver atrophy, or hepatic resection (group I) and compared them with nine patients with postcholecystectomy stricture and portal hypertension, but no atrophy or resection (group II). Portal hypertension was diagnosed a mean 28 months (range 18-48 months) after cholecystectomy in group I compared with 62 months (range 36-100 months) for patients in group II (p less than 0.005 Mann-Whitney test). Thus hepatocyte hyperplasia may be an important part of the mechanism underlying the development of portal hypertension in chronic biliary disease.\r"

Last year, in a severe attack, he tried oral clonidine 150 micrograms twice a day and found it to be dramatically effective. He was completely relieved in three days and tapered off the drug thereafter. A further attack of proctalgia fugax after a month was again treated successfully with oral clonidine. The presumed aetiology of proctalgia fugax is discussed and the possible mechanism of action of clonidine in this condition is outlined. Further trials of clonidine appear to be worthwhile for this condition which has been described as incurable.\r"

Mortality from cancers of various organs has been determined using a 'years at risk' calculation in five year bands. There was no increase in mortality risk from any cancers during the first 15 postoperative years, but from 20 years after operation there was a significant excess risk not only of cancer of the stomach (4.5-fold), but also of the large bowel (1.6-fold), bronchus (3.9-fold), pancreas (4.0-fold), biliary tract (9.1-fold), oesophagus (2.3-fold), bladder (2.4-fold), breast (4.0-fold), and cancer of all sites (3.3-fold).

At night, episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) accounted for 1.2 +/- 0.7% of recording time. Periods of gastric motor activity, representing the gastric component of the migrating motor complex (MMC), recurred every 78 +/- 31 min during the night and were interspersed with periods of gastric motor quiescence. Nocturnal episodes of GOR during periods of gastric motor activity were of longer duration (p less than 0.001) and more frequent (p less than 0.005) than during periods of gastric motor quiescence. At night, periodic gastric motor activity was thus correlated (p less than 0.001) with an increase in the duration and number of GOR episodes and associated with a 100-fold increase in oesophageal acid exposure. During the day, the gastric component of the MMC, recurring every 131 +/- 64 min, was correlated (p less than 0.02) with an increase in the duration and number of GOR episodes, and a three fold increase in oesophageal acid exposure. Further, 89% of nocturnal, and 83% of diurnal gastric MMCs were temporally associated with episodes of GOR. We conclude that fasting episodes of GOR occur coincidentally with the gastric component of the MMC.\r"

In vitro studies showed that both glass electrodes were similar and superior to the antimony electrode with respect to response time, drift, and sensitivity. The effect of the siting of the reference electrode on the recorded pH was examined in five human volunteers. The pH reading using a remote skin reference electrode was higher by a mean of 0.3 pH units (range 0.0-0.6) in the stomach, lower by 0.65 pH units (0.5-0.8) in the duodenum and lower by 0.3 pH units (0.0-0.6) in the oesophagus than that simultaneously obtained with an intraluminal reference electrode. Buccal reference electrodes gave similar readings to skin. Combined reference and glass pH electrodes are recommended for 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "The variability in manometric measurements of oesophageal peristalsis was assessed in 10 volunteers. The amplitude, velocity and duration of the peristaltic waves resulting from 10 separate 10 ml boluses of water were measured at fixed distances above the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). After a 10 minute rest period with the manometry catheter still in situ peristaltic values in response to a second group of 10 10 ml boluses were measured. The measurement of peristaltic amplitude at a fixed distance above the LOS showed wide interindividual variation--for example, at 8 cm above the LOS the variation between individuals was marked (p less than 0.001). At the same site, however, there was only a small intra individual variation noted with time (p greater than 0.25). Similar differences were noted at 16 and 4 cm above the LOS. For the first group of swallows, while the interindividual variation remained high (p less than 0.025), the measurement variation from site to site was of lesser magnitude (p greater than 0.1). Similar findings were noted for interindividual variation and site to site variation at the second group of swallows. The values for velocity showed a similar pattern of variation. From this study we conclude that manometric measurements can be used as a valid method for assessing the effects of drugs on peristalsis in individuals provided all measurements are made at the exact same level in the oesophagus and 'normal' subjects with a large inherent variation are excluded. Any studies comparing peristaltic values in different population groups - for example, normal v reflux patients, may not detect any significant difference even with large sample numbers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we examined the contribution of postpyloric resistances to this braking system. Seven dogs had gastric emptying of 250 ml 15% dextrose, labelled with 99mTc-DTPA, measured by gamma camera imaging (preoperative studies: n = 21). A proximal duodenal cannula was inserted and studies repeated in four modes: with the cannula closed (n = 14); with total diversion of gastric effluent through the cannula (n = 7); with diversion and downstream reinstillation of effluent at a constant rate (n = 14) equivalent to emptying calculated from studies without diversion; and with diversion and total reinstillation of effluent (n = 14). Gastric emptying at 90 minutes was similar in preoperative studies (48 +/- 5% - mean +/- SEM) and in those with the cannula closed (50 +/- 3%). By comparison 'total diversion' produced rapid emptying over 90 minutes (97 +/- 1%; p less than 0.001). Reinstillation of effluent at a constant rate reduced the 90 minute emptying to 59 +/- 6%, and total reinstillation slowed emptying further to 37 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). Neither reinstillation protocol yielded gastric emptying rates that were significantly different from those in studies without diversion. With total reinstillation, emptying and hence reinstillation rates were more variable, proceeding in a step and plateau fashion. We conclude that canine jejunal osmoreceptor activity is mediated through the stomach, with postpyloric resistances playing little or no role. Gastric emptying curve analysis suggested that increments of rapid small bowel filling provoke exaggerated braking responses.\r"

During continuous recording of interdigestive myoelectric activity, laparotomy under thiopental anaesthesia (Nesdonal 40 mg/kg ip) induced a primary phase of total inhibition of spiking activity lasting 26.1 +/- 1.3 min (mean +/- SE) followed by a period of disorganised activity, the first propagated migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) occurring 71.4 +/- 7.9 min after laparotomy. Phentolamine (3 mg/kg), or yohimbine (1 mg/kg) given im before laparotomy decreased by 48 and 49%, respectively, the duration of postsurgical inhibition, with a normal MMC pattern occurring immediately after. In contrast, there was only a shortening of the postlaparotomy initial inhibition of spiking activity after im prazosin (100 micrograms/kg), with a late (50-60 min) recovery of the MMC pattern. These results suggest that the initial inhibition of intestinal motility induced by laparotomy may involve alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, while the disruption of the MMC pattern is mainly caused by the activation of alpha-2 receptors.\r"

Cold water significantly delayed transit compared with warm water control (warm water 71.8 +/- 3.6 mins v cold water 93.2 +/- 5.7 mins p less than 0.01), with significant rises in blood pressure pulse rate perceived discomfort and plasma catecholamines. In contrast mental stimulation was unaccompanied by any change in transit (control; 67.4 +/- 4.7 v test 64.3 +/- 5.3 mins p greater than 0.1) despite a significant rise in pulse rate, skin conductance and plasma catecholamines. Repeated cold water immersion studies in eight individuals produced consistent orocaecal transit and autonomic responses, whereas mental stimulation showed reduced autonomic responses on repeat testing, suggesting that tolerance to the stimulus had occurred. The results of these studies show stimulus specific gastrointestinal response patterns to autonomic stimuli, and appear to have important implications for the design of future studies of human gastrointestinal autonomic physiology and for the investigation of patients with stress related gut dysfunction.\r"

The test was based on the counting of the abdominal retention of a 75-selenium labelled homotaurocholic acid. The 75SeHCAT test was carried out in a control group of 23 healthy adults and in 46 patients, 38 of whom were suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) of diarrhoeic form and eight patients who had undergone cholecystectomy and were suffering from chronic diarrhoea. Faecal bile acid loss was determined in nine patients, and in 14, serum bile acid increase after a standard meal was measured. In 17, SBTT was studied by hydrogen breath test after lactulose administration (21 g in 300 ml water). In 15 patients, choledochocaecal transit time was estimated by Tc99m-HIDA (111 MBq) cholescintigraphy. In 20 of 46 subjects, 75SeHCAT retention was below normal level, and in 19 cholestyramine administration relieved diarrhoea. 75SeHCAT results were related to faecal bile acid loss, while no correlation was found with serum bile acids and SBTT. The data suggest a possible wider use of the 75SeHCAT test in chronic diarrhoea to estimate bile acid malabsorption in irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhoeic form, and provide an effective treatment. In our patients small bowel transit velocity does not seem to be a pathogenetic factor of bile acid malabsorption.\r"

Phagocyte rich suspensions were made by EDTA collagenase dissociation followed by elutriation centrifugation. Phagocytosis was evaluated by measuring cellular radioactivity after incubation of phagocytes with 3H-adenine labelled E coli ON2 and checked microscopically. Dissociation of normal mucosa from colorectal neoplasms yielded means of 1.9 X 10(6) eosinophils, 1.4 X 10(6) macrophages and 2 X 10(5) neutrophils per gram of mucosa. Visually normal mucosa of inflammatory states yielded 2.2 X 10(6) eosinophils, 2.3 X 10(6) macrophages and 7 X 10(5) neutrophils per gram of mucosa. Phagocyte rich suspensions of normal mucosa from tumour patients phagocytosed 21.8% of a pool of opsonised tritiated E coli ON2 and by microscopy 100% of mucosal neutrophils ingested bacteria, 83% of eosinophils were phagocytic, and 53% of macrophages contained bacteria. These results suggest that in the human colonic mucosa, the eosinophil is more abundant than the macrophage and the per cent of those cells exhibiting phagocytosis is intermediate between that of the macrophage and the neutrophil. Thus these three types of cells are actively phagocytic and share the potential for a major role in host defence against invasive enteric bacteria.\r"

In the present study sera from coeliac disease patients from the United Kingdom and the United States were assayed for neutralising antibody to Ad12 as evidence of past exposure to that virus and for antibody to synthetic peptides of A-gliadin from the region of shared sequence with the Ad12 E1b protein. Eighty nine per cent of untreated coeliac disease patients had evidence of previous Ad12 infection. There was also a significant increase in the prevalence of neutralising antibody to Ad12 among treated adults (33.3%) and children (30.8%) with coeliac disease compared with controls (0-12.8%) in the western USA and in London. There was no evidence for an increased prevalence of infection with a closely related adenovirus, adenovirus 18, or another enteric virus, Echovirus 11, among coeliac disease subjects. Additional studies documented that a region of A-gliadin that shares amino acid sequence homology with the adenovirus 12 E1b protein could be recognised as an antigenic determinant in active coeliac disease patients. Taken together, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that a viral protein may play a role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, perhaps by virtue of immunological cross reactivity between antigenic determinants shared by the viral protein and alpha-gliadins.\r"
