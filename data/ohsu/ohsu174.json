This stock was shown to be capable of development and transmission by native California Triatoma protracta protracta. Isozyme analysis indicated that this T. cruzi is closely related to the Tehuantepec strain and to a lesser extent the Miles' zymodeme 1 strain. The potential public health significance of development and transmission of exotic stocks of T. cruzi by native reduviids is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We report in this paper significant differences in the virulence of insect-derived and cultured metacyclic forms of Trypanosoma cruzi which are morphologically indistinguishable. Mice infected intraperitoneally with 10(3) metacyclic T. cruzi isolated from Rhodnius prolixus showed average parasitemia levels greater than 2 X 10(5) organisms/ml around day 10 post-infection (when first measured) and peak levels recorded on day 16 post-infection exceeded 4 X 10(7) organisms/ml. None of these animals survived after 30 days post-infection. In contrast, in mice infected with 10(3) or 10(4) metacyclic forms from axenic cultures the highest average parasitemia was approximately 10(4) organisms/ml and occurred around day 19 post-infection. In these animals, parasitemias declined with time to become undetectable and no mortality was recorded over the 100-day observation period. There was also a marked difference in the 50% lethal dose of insect- and culture-derived metacyclics. The value for the former was 670 parasites whereas none of the mice infected intraperitoneally with up to 10(6) cultured metacyclics died. These results point to a marked difference in the biological properties of insect-borne and cultured T. cruzi metacyclics under our experimental conditions and caution against extending results obtained with the latter to vector-transmissible metacyclics, at least in infectivity and virulence studies.\r"

To determine whether a plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine is immunogenic in patients with schistosomiasis, 32 individuals infected with S. mansoni were given three 20-micrograms doses of Heptavax-B vaccine and treated with praziquantel. Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen developed in 90.6% of the study subjects after three doses of vaccine. Five patients (15.6%) had a weak response to the vaccine, and three patients (9.4%) failed to develop antibody. A weak or failed response to the vaccine was significantly associated with the presence of hepatosplenomegaly. A plasma-derived vaccine is immunogenic for persons infected with S. mansoni; however, vaccine response is diminished in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.\r"

The extent of scrub typhus rickettsial association with host cells was dependent on the rickettsial and target cell concentrations and on the medium in which the infection took place. Brain heart infusion broth, a standard rickettsial diluent for infectivity, was markedly inhibitory. Both rickettsial and host cell replication were dependent on a component(s) supplied by serum to the tissue culture medium; rickettsial multiplication was less affected by small temperature variation (optimum 34 to 37 degrees C) than was host cell growth (optimum 37 degrees C). The antibiotic daunomycin was very useful in selectively inhibiting host cell replication and permitting attainment of somewhat greater rickettsial yields than in uninhibited cells. These findings have underscored the close relationship between parasite and infected cell and have led to more predictable, higher yields of rickettsiae in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The assay of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infectivity by plaquing has been improved substantially by a number of changes which were based on our understanding of factors which enhance scrub typhus rickettsial infection of, and replication in, cultured cells. Greater numbers of plaques and/or larger plaques resulted from: use of tissue culture medium instead of brain heart infusion broth as the rickettsial diluent; plaquing in a contact-inhibited mouse embryo cell line rather than in growth-inhibited or uninhibited Vero cells; infection and incubation of monolayers at 35 degrees C instead of at lower temperatures; frequent feeding of infected cultures with medium containing ample amounts of serum; and inclusion of chicken serum in the overlay medium. Plaquing in 24-well tissue culture plates instead of in petri dishes or flasks greatly simplified the handling of large numbers of samples and was beneficial economically as well. Easily recognized rickettsial plaques were counted microscopically under x40 magnification, and maximum counts were obtained 12-14 days after infection, depending on the rickettsial strain. Slightly longer incubation yielded macroscopically visible counts. In addition to enhancing plaque number and size, the changes in standard R. tsutsugamushi plaquing methods resulted in an easier, faster, and more reliable assay, with improved reproducibility of plaque formation, maintenance of infected cell monolayers, and avoidance of microbial contamination.\r"

All of the agents produced viremia in the hamsters, regardless of the order of their administration. The antibody response, as measured by plaque reduction neutralization test, was monotypic even after two consecutive phlebovirus infections. Arumowot and Chagres viruses produced nonfatal infections in adult hamsters, which were characterized by viremia of several days duration and subsequent antibody formation. In contrast, Gabek Forest virus produced a fulminating and rapidly fatal disease in phlebovirus nonimmune animals. In hamsters previously infected with Chagres and/or Arumowot viruses, Gabek Forest infection was less severe, indicating some degree of cross-protection. The degree of cross-protection was in part related to the sequence of previous phlebovirus infections. No evidence of immune enhancement or other immunopathologic events were observed in the animals.\r"

Emergency operation in seven adults with unsuspected choledochal cysts resulted in reoperation in all seven. Each patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, a mass, and cholangitis or jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography incorrectly identified the cyst as a dilated gallbladder in three of the patients. All initial emergency drainage procedures required subsequent modification to cyst excision and Roux-Y reconstruction. From review of the experience presented and the literature to date, we recommend that otherwise stable patients be managed nonsurgically and undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography to plan primary single-stage excisional operation. Patients requiring emergency decompression should have cholecystostomy or choledochostomy for good control without compromising subsequent operation. At the time of excision, a technical consideration not previously reported is the presence of small daughter cysts in Calot's triangle which must be distinguished from the hepatic bile ducts. The surgical literature has frequently addressed the problems of elective surgery for choledochal cysts; however, emergency complications requiring urgent operative intervention are seldom addressed. We believe emergency intervention should correct the urgent complication without compromising the definitive surgical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Combining these reported and estimated incidences of mortality from overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, splenic salvage with nonoperative observation therapy and operative therapy, and the incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis and related mortality provides a conditional probability estimation of the risks of death with nonoperative observation therapy and operative therapy (Figure 4). The combined mortality rates for nonoperative observation and operative therapies are based on the following measured and estimated statistics: The post-transfusion hepatitis death rate per unit of blood transfused is 0.14 percent. Forty percent of children and 20 percent of adults who have successful nonoperative observation therapy receive an average of 2 units of blood. One hundred percent of children and adults in whom nonoperative observation therapy is unsuccessful receive an average of 4 units of blood. Twenty percent of children and adults who undergo operation initially receive an average of 2 units of blood. Ten percent of observed children require laparotomy and 75 percent of these patients then undergo splenectomy. Forty percent of adults who have nonoperative observation initially later require laparotomy, 93 percent of whom also require splenectomy. Ten percent of children and adults treated with initial operation later require splenectomy. Death from overwhelming postsplenectomy infection occurs in 0.026 percent of adults who undergo splenectomy and 0.052 percent of children who undergo splenectomy. Given these assumptions, the conditional probability of death in a child who initially undergoes nonoperative observation therapy is 0.17 percent compared with 0.06 percent for initial operative therapy. In adults, 0.26 percent of the observed patients die compared with 0.06 percent for those operated on initially. As stated, many of the percentages or probabilities listed are estimations based on the best available clinical data. The inability to establish a mortality rate from overwhelming postsplenectomy infection remotely resembling that reported for otherwise healthy patients required an unsubstantiated estimate. However, even when mortality rates from overwhelming postsplenectomy infection of 0.43 percent and 0.6 percent were substituted, early laparotomy still produced lower mortality rates. This continues to be true if one assumes that early laparotomy will result in 50 percent or even 100 percent of patients undergoing splenectomy, although in these cases the statistical differences would be less. We acknowledge that these statistics may exceed or underestimate the true risk of either treatment plan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-two patients were anesthetized with isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and fentanyl, which was continuously infused throughout the study. Postoperatively three 1-mg doses of butorphanol were administered IV. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, and pain intensity were essentially unchanged after butorphanol. Most of the improvement in breathing occurred after the first 1-mg dose. Mean respiratory rate increased from 7.8 +/- 5.0 to 11.0 +/- 4.8 min-1 (P less than or equal to 0.005), tidal volume increased from 469 +/- 302 to 844 +/- 390 ml (P less than or equal to 0.005), minute ventilation increased from 4.32 +/- 2.97 to 8.51 +/- 3.14 L/min (P less than or equal to 0.005), and the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 increased from 0.36 +/- 0.37 to 0.90 +/- 0.80 L X min-1 X mm Hg-1 (P less than or equal to 0.05).

At each frequency, the tidal volume required to achieve isocapnia (VTiso) was measured by plethysmography. In an individual dog, VTiso could be related to frequency by an equation of the form VTiso = KfA. A was similar for the seven dogs, A = -0.54 +/- 0.03. K varied from 179 to 325 cc- Hz-A, reflecting differences between the dogs in dead space, CO2 production and gradient for gas transport. This relation is consistent with that predicted from the data of previous investigators who used different ventilators, circuits and methodology. From 3 to 30 Hz, VTiso decreased from 1.2 to 0.4 times anatomic plus equipment dead space, but minute volumes required to maintain isocapnia increased from 6 to 18 times those required during conventional ventilation. We conclude that low tidal volume ventilation is also high minute volume ventilation.\r"

Each dog had 5 ml of mucin injected 10 cm down the endotracheal tube prior to a 30-sec period of intermittent positive pressure ventilation. After this procedure, the ventilator was disconnected and the secretions were removed by suction with the 12- or 18-French catheters or by the Fogarty catheter. Each dog had balloon removal performed twice and suction performed once with the 12-French and once with the 18-French catheter. The endotracheal tube was cleaned and a 15-min stabilization period was allowed between each experiment. Arterial blood pressure (MAP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) did not change after either technique. There were no ECG changes, arrhythmias, or alterations in PaCO2. The PaO2 was significantly lower in the two suction catheter groups [520 +/- 33 mm Hg (12 French) and 451 +/- 31 mm Hg (18 French)] than in the balloon removal group (564 +/- 10 mm Hg) (P less than 0.05). The balloon technique removed more secretions (4.52 +/- 0.06 ml) than did suction (12 French, 1.32 +/- 0.17 ml; 18 French, 2.11 +/- 0.44 ml). Balloon removal of tracheal secretions has two advantages over conventional suction techniques: it removes more secretions, and it has less detrimental effect on arterial oxygenation.\r"

Eighty-six unpremedicated, unrestrained, untrained mongrel dogs were given one of eight doses of fentanyl citrate (125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 micrograms/kg) as a single intravenous bolus injection. Dogs breathed spontaneously without oxygen supplementation. Anesthesia was assessed every 5 min until absence of anesthesia was recorded for two consecutive evaluations. Venous plasma samples were obtained in two or three dogs receiving each of the doses of fentanyl 5 min after fentanyl injection and again when application of the tail clamp elicited either vocalization or movement (positive response). Fentanyl resulted in recumbency in all animals except two receiving 125 micrograms/kg. Although all doses of fentanyl produced anesthesia in at least one animal 5 min after injection, the duration of anesthesia was short, responses unpredictable, and anesthesia achieved in all animals only with a dose of 3000 micrograms/kg. Increasing doses of fentanyl resulted in higher plasma fentanyl concentrations 5 min after injection and at the time of the first positive response to tail clamp but there was great variability. All doses of fentanyl caused statistically significant decreases in heart and respiratory rates but none produced apnea or a PaCO2 higher than 67 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, the effects of SNP and nitroglycerin (NTG) on striated muscle vessels were studied in 42 hamsters using intravital microscopy, quantitative video image analysis, a platinum multiwire electrode for local Po2 measurements, and a micropuncture system for the determination of microcirculatory pressure. A transparent chamber was implanted in a dorsal skin fold. When the mean arterial pressure was reduced to 70 or 40 mmHg by SNP, the precapillaries dilated and precapillary resistance decreased, but significant changes in venular diameter were not observed. However, SNP-induced hypotension was associated with a consistent increase in intravascular pressure within the venules. As a result, the arteriolar-venular pressure gradient was reduced by more than 50%. Furthermore, the functional capillary density was less, and tissue hypoxia was present during SNP hypotension. In contrast, NTG dilated both arterioles and venules in the microvascular network. Despite a lower blood cell velocity in all segments, the functional capillary density and local Po2 remained unchanged during NTG, principally because there was only a 10% reduction of the arteriolar-venular pressure gradient. These findings suggest that, in terms of tissue oxygenation, NTG may be preferable to SNP for deliberate hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of three hypotensive agents, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), nitroglycerin (NTG), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), on blood flow distribution and vascular capacitance were examined in dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. To eliminate the modification by the baroreflex, carotid sinus was denervated and aortic and cardiopulmonary vagal fibers were sectioned. Total systemic circulation was divided into two parallel compartments, splanchnic (SP) and extra-splanchnic (ESP) vascular beds. Alteration of vascular capacitance was assessed by a change in systemic blood volume with constant cardiac output and constant venous pressure using a total heart-lung bypass. SNP- and ATP-induced hypotension caused blood flow redistribution from the SP to ESP beds, and this redistribution is greater (P less than 0.01) with ATP than that with SNP. In contrast, NTG-induced hypotension did not significantly cause redistribution. Systemic blood volume was increased during NTG- (10.4 +/- 2.2 ml/kg), and SNP-induced (4.8 +/- 1.1 ml/kg) hypotension. The increase by NTG was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that by SNP. In contrast, ATP-induced hypotension did not significantly change systemic blood volume. Since redistribution can result in a passive change in vascular capacitance, the differences in capacitance among SNP, NTG, and ATP can be explained in part by differences in redistribution of blood flow. Redistribution of blood flow from SP to ESP beds can increase venous return due to increasing the slope of the venous return curve. The results suggest that redistribution should be taken into consideration in evaluating the hemodynamic changes during induced hypotension.\r"

In 19 patients, a beta-blocker and in 17 patients a calcium-channel blocker were continued throughout the study period without alteration of their doses. The study consisted of a two-week run-in period and an eleven-week active drug period. Acute titration was done with nitroglycerin patches on the basis of weekly patient diaries on frequency of angina and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption. Overall, reductions in frequency of angina and in nitroglycerin consumption were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Adverse reactions were common but tolerable. The reported side effects were headache in 32, skin rash in 18, dizziness in 10, palpitation and itching in 9 each, nausea in 7, flushing in 3, and vomiting in 1 patient. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that individual dose titration with nitroglycerin patches for obtaining significant antianginal effect is essential. The present therapeutic system is convenient to use and well tolerated and had acceptable side effects in our study population.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar-macrophage-derived 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) are thought to be important mediators of lung inflammation and injury. Inhibition of AA metabolism may be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism of glucocorticoid (GC) action. In the present study, we have examined the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on leukotriene (LT) B4 and LTC4 synthesis by cultured rat alveolar macrophages (AMs) stimulated with the proinflammatory particle zymosan. Zymosan stimulation resulted in the formation of LTB4 greater than thromboxane B2 (TxB2) greater than LTC4 as assessed by both high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Sixteen hours of pretreatment with 1 microM MP maximally inhibited synthesis of TxB2 by 76 +/- 4%, LTB4 by 83 +/- 3%, and LTC4 by 91 +/- 3%. The inhibition of eicosanoids was specific, as the sex hormones progesterone, testosterone, and beta-estradiol had no consistent effect. Inhibition was dose-dependent, with 50% inhibition of synthesis occurring at 10(-7) M for TxB2, but at 10(-8) M for both LTB4 and LTC4. Pretreatment with MP for only 1 h inhibited LTC4 production (42 +/- 3%) to a greater extent than either TxB2 (25 +/- 1%) or LTB4 (14 +/- 7%). These data indicate that MP significantly and substantially inhibits zymosan-induced LTB4 and LTC4 synthesis. Furthermore, the greater degree, greater potency, and faster onset of action for MP inhibition of LT synthesis than of TxB2 synthesis suggest the possibility that MP may exert postphospholipase effect(s) on LT synthesis. These results support the possibility that modulation of AM arachidonate metabolism may represent an important anti-inflammatory mechanism of GC action in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of negative pressure ventilation (NPV) in alleviating sleep-induced reductions in alveolar ventilation and in producing long-term clinical benefits was studied in 5 patients (54 +/- 8 yr of age; mean +/- SD) with chronic respiratory failure secondary to restrictive ventilatory impairment (VC, 40 +/- 14% predicted; TLC, 72 +/- 18% predicted; FEV1/FVC, 89 +/- 15%). In control sleep studies, arterial O2 saturation decreased from 81 +/- 6% during wakefulness to 79 +/- 1% during non-REM sleep and to 67 +/- 3% during REM sleep, and transcutaneous PCO2 increased from 80 +/- 16 mm Hg during wakefulness and non-REM sleep to 87 +/- 16 mm Hg during REM sleep. Nocturnal NPV in a cuirass ventilator improved baseline ventilation during wakefulness and prevented deterioration of alveolar ventilation during sleep. Upper airway obstruction during sleep induced by NPV was successfully managed with either a tricyclic medication or nasal CPAP. After 8 wk of nocturnal NPV, all patients felt considerably better. Daytime resting arterial PCO2 decreased from 56 +/- 2 to 46 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and PO2 increased from 51 +/- 9 to 70 +/- 10 mm Hg (NS). Four patients have continued NPV at home on a regular basis and have returned to full-time employment. We conclude that nocturnal NPV is an effective method of preventing sleep-induced reductions in alveolar ventilation and a practical method of long-term management of patients with nonobstructive chronic respiratory failure.\r"

To test the hypothesis that these patients may be experiencing chronic respiratory muscle fatigue, we studied the effects of resting the respiratory muscles in a group of patients with severe COPD. Fifteen stable patients with severe COPD were randomized into study and control groups. In 8 study group patients (Group B), breathing was assisted with a negative pressure ventilator 3 to 6 h daily for 3 consecutive days. The remaining 7 patients served as controls (Group A) and did not receive any intervention. Baseline lung function was evaluated by spirometry and arterial blood gas determinations. Respiratory muscle strength and endurance were evaluated by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP, respectively) and the maximal duration that isocapnic hyperventilation equal to 50 and 70% of the 12-s maximal voluntary ventilation could be sustained (DSV). Baseline DSV was determined as the best effort of several practice trials. All measurements were repeated on the final day of assisted ventilation approximately 2 to 3 h after its discontinuation. After assisted ventilation, the DSV at 50 and 70% of the maximal voluntary ventilation improved significantly (p less than 0.05). Maximal inspiratory pressure and MEP increased to 114% (p less than 0.05) and 112% (p = 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. Mean arterial PCO2 in the hypercapnic subgroup of Group B patients decreased from 60 mm Hg before to 52 mm Hg after assisted ventilation (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The integrity of the respiratory epithelium may be important in development of bronchial hyperreactivity; however, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. This study was undertaken to determine if epithelium of rabbit intrapulmonary bronchi is capable of modulating the responsiveness of airway smooth muscle to a pharmacologic stimulus, and whether epithelial-derived prostaglandins play a role in this modulatory function. Mechanical removal of the epithelium from bronchial segments, or incubation of intact bronchi with indomethacin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis) increased the sensitivity of bronchial smooth muscle to bethanechol. Cyclooxygenase was localized within mucosal epithelial cells of intact airways by avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining using a monoclonal antibody to the enzyme. Removal of the epithelium significantly reduced the levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha accumulated in the media surrounding bronchial explants. In epithelium-intact bronchi precontracted with bethanechol, arachidonic acid evoked an indomethacin-sensitive relaxation response comparable to relaxation induced by exogenous addition of PGE2. Although PGE2 evoked similar responses in epithelium-denuded bronchi, arachidonic acid-induced relaxation responses were negligible. The results suggest epithelial cells of rabbit bronchi modulate the responsiveness to pharmacologic stimuli by production and release of an inhibitory cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid.\r"

We report the clinical course of a young, healthy person who developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia after taking a 3800-mg dose of flecainide acetate. Sinus rhythm was restored without pacing or cardioversion after infusion of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, physostigmine, and a sodium load. The initial flecainide serum levels were five times greater than the usual upper therapeutic level. Electrocardiography showed that the lengthened electrocardiographic time intervals decreased in correlation with falling drug levels.

We used this model to compare the efficacy of ceftazidime and tobramycin alone and in combination in the therapy of Pseudomonas pneumonia. The two antibiotics were shown to be synergistic in vitro for the strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. Treated animals receiving both antibiotics had fewer viable bacteria remaining in lung tissues (P less than 0.05) and exhibited a trend towards improved survival in comparison to animals receiving a single drug. In this model of Pseudomonas pneumonia, in vitro synergy was reflected by increased efficacy in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Since monoamine neurotransmitter disturbances exist in some cases of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), monoamine-enhancing drugs may ameliorate some symptoms of DAT. L-Deprenyl is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor that is generally free of undesired effects. At low doses (10 mg/d) it selectively inhibits MAO-B, an enzyme whose level is elevated in the brains of patients with DAT who are studied post mortem. At higher doses it has more complex effects, including inhibition of MAO-A plus MAO-B. We administered 10 mg/d and 40 mg/d of L-deprenyl to 17 patients with DAT in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, serial treatment. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores decreased significantly during 10-mg/d treatment, with decreases in measures of anxiety/depression, tension, and excitement. Approximately one half of the patients' conditions were judged to be improved clinically, with evidence of increased activity and social interaction along with reduced tension and retardation. Similar but smaller changes were observed during 40-mg/d treatment. The behavioral changes were associated with improvement in performance on a complex cognitive task requiring sustained effort. There were minimal physiologic and side effects. The greater effect of low-dose L-deprenyl therapy suggests that it is the inhibition of MAO-B, and not MAO-A, that may be important in the behavioral effects of L-deprenyl administration to patients with DAT.\r"

We describe the use of a double antibody immunofluorescence technique to document the existence of a monoclonal antibody with nuclear antigen activity. The patient was an elderly woman with a small monoclonal protein, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorder. A homogeneous antinuclear antibody (ANA) prompted further studies to determine whether the monoclonal protein was related to the ANA activity. A double-antibody immunofluorescence procedure is described by which the ANA positivity was shown to be entirely due to a monoclonal IgMK protein. It consists of using fluorescein anti-kappa and rhodamine anti-lambda applied to a section of mouse kidney treated with the patient's serum. Documentation of antigenic specificity of monoclonal antibodies by double antibody fluorescence provides a straightforward method that can be utilized by routine clinical laboratories.\r"

Following heparinization, the carotid arteries were transected, cleaned along their edges, and repaired on the right side by laser and on the left side by suture. The laser-assisted vascular anastomosis (LAVA) required four stay sutures and laser power for welding. Six-week patency for LAVA vs suture anastomosis was 100% vs 92%, respectively. Anastomotic time requirements were less with LAVA (seven vs 25 minutes). Intimal healing for both techniques immediately demonstrated an intraluminal thrombus, which resolved showing complete endothelial repair by four weeks. The laser seal demonstrated little inflammation compared with the giant cell reaction of suture anastomosis. Immediate wall tensions of 6 to 18 X 10(5) dynes/cm2 were tolerated after both techniques. Laser-assisted vascular anastomosis of large-diameter arteries is feasible, strong, and associated with minimal inflammation.\r"

No aortic-related deaths or hemorrhages occurred. Smooth regenerated conduits without stenoses were seen in 27 of 28 specimens, with one small aneurysm. Transprosthetic myofibroblast migration and proliferation paralleled the kinetics of macrophage-mediated prosthetic dissolution, which was consequently delayed compared with polyglycolic acid prostheses. Confluent endothelial-like luminal surfaces were present after two weeks. Progressive inner capsular thickening ended after three months at 420 micron. Ex vivo compliance curves resembled arterial elasticity. Regenerated tissue withstood 1200 mm Hg of systolic pressure, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha to thromboxane B2 ratios did not differ from normal control specimens.\r"

No significant correlation between increased amounts of anticardiolipin antibodies and clinical symptoms, such as thrombocytopenia or thrombosis, was found. Serial serum samples from 28 patients (12 patients were from the epidemiologic cohort) were analyzed. Sixteen of these 28 patients (57.1%) had increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies; in most cases, there was no variation in these values with regard to clinical disease flares or treatment. Increased concentrations of anticardiolipin were observed in 4 patients with cerebral infarction. However, very high concentrations of anticardiolipin antibodies were observed in several patients with inactive SLE who had no history of thrombosis or thrombocytopenia. Our results underscore the importance of studying unselected patient groups when correlating laboratory data with clinical manifestations of disease.\r"

A dose-dependent increase in GAG production was found, to a maximum of 500%. Increase was detected at doses as low as 1 pg/ml of rIL-1 beta, reached a maximum at 10-100 pg/ml, and was apparent 10 hours after addition of rIL-1 beta. Stimulation of GAG was always accompanied by increased accumulation of prostaglandin E (PGE) in culture media and by increased collagenase production in approximately one-half the experiments. Indomethacin (5 micrograms/ml) completely inhibited PGE stimulation by rIL-1 beta, but only partially inhibited that of GAG overproduction and had no effect on collagenase production. Hydrocortisone (2 micrograms/ml) inhibited stimulation of all 3 parameters. Stimulation of hyaluronate in synovial cultures prevailed over that of sulfated GAG, which occurred to a lesser extent. Our results support earlier suggestions that interleukin-1 is a major active mononuclear cell factor that is capable of inducing profound changes in connective tissue cell function.\r"

Using a rabbit model, full-thickness auricular composite grafts were created, rotated 180 degrees, and reattached. At 21 days, all grafts were assessed for area of survival and postexcisional weight. Animals receiving 30 mg/kg of intramuscular methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily, during the first four postoperative days, demonstrated a significant increase in graft survival compared with controls. Heparin and nitroglycerin produced no change compared with controls. Furthermore, the only grafts to achieve 100% survival were found in the group treated with methylprednisolone.\r"

Venous blood was sampled before, during and after surgery and on the 5th day after operation to study the haemostatic mechanism. There were no preoperative differences between the two anaesthetic groups. Although there was pronounced individual variability, similar patterns of change in coagulation, platelets and fibrinolysis were seen in both groups. However, there were significant differences between the two groups in platelet count, thrombin production, and Factor VIIIRAg in the intra- and immediate postoperative periods. Also, compared with general anaesthesia, there was less intraoperative activation of fibrinolysis, as measured by the euglobulin clot lysis time, with spinal anaesthesia. These differences suggest slight modification of the haemostatic response to surgery with spinal anaesthesia, which could be consistent with a neuroendocrine mechanism. By the 5th day both groups exhibited a very similar \"hypercoagulable\" postoperative state.\r"

A comparison was made with atracurium 0.09 mg kg-1 (and placebo) in a double-blind prospective randomized trial. LAS and atracurium were effective in reducing the incidence and severity of postsuxamethonium myalgia and the increases in serum potassium concentration. There were no appreciable changes in serum calcium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine, creatine phosphokinase concentrations or plasmacholinesterase activity. Atracurium caused a delay in the onset of action and a decrease in the intensity of suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular block.

In dogs with no induced intracranial hypertension, ICP increased during the administration of mannitol, reached a peak at 2 min after infusion, and then gradually decreased (P less than 0.05). More marked changes in ICP were observed in response to higher values of PaCO2 (P less than 0.05). In dogs with induced intracranial hypertension, the rapid infusion of mannitol caused an exponential decrease in ICP, without initial increase, which was significantly steeper at higher values of PaCO2 (P less than 0.05). This was followed by a more gradual decrease which achieved pre-balloon inflation values 10 min after infusion. We postulate that the absence of the initial increase in ICP is the result of a concomitant decrease in arterial pressure, a reduction in the volume-pressure response of the brain, the failure of mannitol to dilate further the cerebral arterial vascular bed and a hitherto unnoticed early water-drawing effect. Our study confirmed the safety of rapidly expanding the circulating blood volume with mannitol in circumstances of increased ICP in dogs.\r"

Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and acid-base balance were determined with each measurement. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 50%. Spinal cord blood flow, as measured by the microsphere method, increased during the period of hypotension, whereas values obtained using the hydrogen washout method were not significantly different from those at normotension. No significant change in spinal cord blood flow was detected by either method after the application of spinal distraction.

Follicles were aspirated 34-36 h after the onset of the endogenous LH surge. Urinary total oestrogen levels during the first 6 days of the luteal phase were significantly higher, the duration of the luteal phase was significantly shorter and the luteal levels of urinary pregnanediol were significantly lower in the two combination treatment cycles than in the clomiphene only cycles. When the three treatment groups were combined the mid-luteal peak pregnanediol levels and the duration of the luteal phase showed significant negative correlations with plasma or urinary oestrogen levels during the follicular and the luteal phase. It is suggested that the luteal function in cycles superovulated with clomiphene/hMG or clomiphene/FSH is disrupted and this is related to the high amounts of circulating oestrogen.\r"

Plasma PGE2 levels were also significantly reduced in patients on fat free PN for three weeks as compared with levels measured while patients were on a fat containing diet. This clinical observation is not yet understood and might be related to changes exerted by fatty acid deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to predict progressive liver damage in hemophiliac patients by noninvasive means, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data from 44 liver biopsies taken from 35 hemophiliac patients. This showed that serum IgG was normal in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) but significantly elevated in those with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) or cirrhosis (CIR) (P less than .001). Relationships were less significant between liver histology and IgM (P less than .01), IgA (P less than .05), and globulin (P less than .05). This was unaffected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody status in asymptomatic individuals. Although patients with progressive liver disease were also older than those with CPH (P less than .001), the immunoglobulin abnormalities were independent of this. Neither clinical examination nor liver biochemistry at the time of biopsy were of significant diagnostic value. Our results indicate that in the absence of AIDS an elevated IgG level is a reliable indicator of progressive hemophilic liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise to exhaustion was associated with the appearance in plasma of plasminogen activator (PA) in several mol wt forms, as identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with zymography. A number of active bands, all immunologically identified as tissue-type PA (t-PA), were observed. The major form had an apparent mol wt of approximately 60,000 and is due to free t-PA. The other strong bands had apparent mol wts of approximately 110,000 and 180,000. The 110,000 band, also present in pre-exercise samples, represents t-PA complexed with its major inhibitor (PAI-1), and the 180,000 band is due to t-PA complexed with C1 inhibitor. The released forms of t-PA were cleared rapidly after cessation of exercise at exhaustion. Urokinase-type PA (u-PA) activity was also identified in pre- and postexercise samples at an apparent mol wt of approximately 50,000. This is consistent with its being free u-PA; no complexed forms of u-PA were observed. Qualitatively similar changes in plasma PA were observed after venous occlusion. Small quantities of plasmin were generated after strenuous exercise, as observed by detection of plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis in three of five subjects. This complex was cleared rapidly after cessation of exercise. Plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex was not detected in any of the subjects after venous occlusion.\r"

After five days' co-cultivation, 100 quinacrine-stained metaphases from both the MC-containing and the MC-free cultures are examined for the presence of a Y chromosome using fluorescence microscopy. In all bona fide FA patients in whom testing was successful, hypersensitivity to MC was readily demonstrated by the striking deficiency of FA metaphases (0.9% to 14.9%) in the MC-containing co-cultures. In contrast, none of the three patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and none of the five with undiagnosed conditions reminiscent of FA exhibited hypersensitivity to MC; cells from them, from parents of FA patients, and from several normal laboratory personnel constituted approximately half of the metaphases (40.4% to 71.2%) of MC-containing co-cultures, as would be expected in the absence of hypersensitivity to MC.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the growth properties of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B CLL) and to identify possible abnormalities thereof, we examined the in vitro action of interleukin 2 (IL2) in four patients. Using radiolabeled IL2 and monoclonal antibodies reactive with IL2 membrane receptors we show that CLL cells, after their activation in vitro, express IL2 receptors of a high- as well as a low-affinity type, exactly as has been reported for normal T and B blasts. In three of the four reported cases, CLL proliferation (measured with 3H-thymidine incorporation) depended on the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to activate the cells and IL2 (optimal concentration, 10 to 100 U IL2/mL). In contrast, the cells of the fourth case of CLL (CLL-4) proliferated in an autonomous fashion, ie, without a need for PHA and IL2 in culture. Specific blocking of the IL2-binding sites with anti-IL2 receptor monoclonal antibodies almost completely inhibited the proliferation of these cells, which indicated that functional IL2 receptors were required for the autonomous proliferation. The demonstration of low concentrations of IL2 activity in the culture medium conditioned by the cells suggests that endogenous IL2 had been responsible for the spontaneous 3H-thymidine uptake by the CLL cells of patient 4. However, we were unable to extract IL2 mRNA from the cells (neither fresh nor after various in vitro incubations) in quantities detectable by Northern blot analysis that would prove that the CLL cells of patient 4 were actively synthesizing IL2 during culture. Thus, individual cases of B CLL are subject to variable growth regulation involving functional IL2 receptors on the cell surface: after activation with PHA the cells respond to exogenous IL2 in a fashion similar to normal B lymphocytes, or the cells are stimulated by endogenous IL2 (or an IL2-like activity) and do not require activation with PHA.\r"

Here, the effect of gamma-interferon on fetal hemoglobin synthesis by purified cord blood, fetal liver, and adult bone marrow erythroid progenitors was studied with a radioligand assay to measure hemoglobin production by BFU-E-derived erythroblasts. Coculture with recombinant gamma-interferon resulted in a significant and dose-dependent decrease in fetal hemoglobin production by neonatal and adult, but not fetal, BFU-E-derived erythroblasts. Accumulation of fetal hemoglobin by cord blood BFU-E-derived erythroblasts decreased up to 38.1% of control cultures (erythropoietin only). Synthesis of both G gamma/A gamma globin was decreased, since the G gamma/A gamma ratio was unchanged. Picograms fetal hemoglobin per cell was decreased by gamma-interferon addition, but picograms total hemoglobin was unchanged, demonstrating that a reciprocal increase in beta-globin production occurred in cultures treated with gamma-interferon. No toxic effect of gamma-interferon on colony growth was noted. The addition of gamma-interferon to cultures resulted in a decrease in the percentage of HbF produced by adult BFU-E-derived cells to 45.6% of control. Fetal hemoglobin production by cord blood, fetal liver, and adult bone marrow erythroid progenitors, was not significantly affected by the addition of recombinant GM-CSF, recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1), recombinant IL-2, or recombinant alpha-interferon. Although fetal progenitor cells appear unable to alter their fetal hemoglobin program in response to any of the growth factors added here, the interaction of neonatal and adult erythroid progenitors with gamma-interferon results in an altered expression of globin genes. This supports the concept that developmental globin gene switching can be regulated by environmental factors.\r"

The first was a 21-year-old man with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) in whom the effects of previous abdominal operations prevented the satisfactory technical insertion of the new liver. He died intraoperatively. The second patient was a 15-year-old boy with CAH who began to synthesize factor VIII coagulant activity (F VIII:C) within 18 hours of successful liver transplantation and has continued to do so for almost 2 years (F VIII:C range 0.89 to 3.20 U/mL). The first 2 months of his postoperative course were complicated by infections, but since that time he has done well and has returned to school. The third patient was a 48-year-old man with portal fibrosis and severe ascites. He synthesized F VIII:C (range 0.96 to 1.50 U/mL) within six hours after reestablishment of circulation through the new liver. His postoperative course was complicated by numerous infections, and he died with sepsis and an acquired immunodeficiency-like syndrome 4 months after transplantation. The fourth patient was a 47-year-old mild hemophiliac with CAH who produced adequate factor VIII:C levels following transplantation (range 0.79 to 2.80 U/mL). These patients demonstrate that liver transplantation in hemophiliacs with end-stage liver disease may be lifesaving and results in correction of the F VIII:C deficiency and associated hemorrhagic tendency.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we describe characteristic ultrastructural changes of CD3- large granular lymphocytes (LGL), ie, natural killer (NK) cells, following stimulation with recombinant (r) interleukin 2 (IL 2) or r-gamma interferon (r-gamma IFN) and after interaction with K562 target cells (TC) or Sepharose-bound anti-Fc gamma receptor (FcR) monoclonal antibody (MoAb). When compared to resting cells the cytolytic activity of r-IL 2- and r-gamma IFN-stimulated cells against K562 TC was enhanced. The r-IL 2-stimulated LGL were larger and consistently displayed the shape and cytoskeletal rearrangement characteristic of activated cells. The Golgi apparatus was expanded, and the number of electron-dense granules and vesicles was increased. The ultrastructural changes in r-gamma IFN-stimulated LGL were markedly different from those observed following r-IL 2 activation. Cells did not exhibit changes in size, shape, cytoskeletal organization, or in the structure of the Golgi apparatus. However, r-gamma IFN-stimulated cells exhibited distinctive changes in the structure and content of electron-dense granules with deaggregation of the matrix and parallel tubular arrays (PTAs). Within organelles apparently derived from the electron-dense granules, vesicular and tubular structures were noted that may be the morphological equivalent of cytotoxic factors produced by cytolytic effector cells. These ultrastructural observations indicate that r-IL 2 and r-gamma IFN enhance the lytic ability of NK cells by acting on distinct cell machineries. The cytolytic ability was decreased when LGL were pretreated with K562 TC or immobilized anti-FcR antibody. In both experimental conditions cells displayed ultrastructural features indicating activation as well as loss of cytoplasmic granules and other Golgi-derived organelles. Stimulation of r-gamma IFN- or r-IL 2-activated LGL with K562 TC or Sepharose-bound anti-FcR antibody decreased their cytolytic ability, with cells depleted of granules at the ultrastructural level. Intracytoplasmic fusion of granules and a massive release of the granule content were found in r-IL 2-stimulated cells, reminiscent of the mechanism of basophil degranulation. These observations suggest that multiple activation signals involving distinct surface membrane molecules induce release of cytolytic factors by both resting and activated NK cells.\r"

Both groups tended to have testosterone levels in the lower normal range and all patients had normal levels of beta-HCG, prolactin and progesterone. The gynaecomastia in our patients was probably the result of an absolute increase in oestradiol or an increase relative to testosterone. Cytotoxic therapy affects both spermatogenesis and Leydig cell function, with a resultant rise in gonadotrophins which may in turn increase testicular oestrogen secretion. In testicular cancer patients, gynaecomastia may be a sign of tumour activity but it may also be caused by hormonal changes resulting from cytotoxic therapy. It is our experience that the latter treatment-related type is harmless, transient and unrelated to the patient's prognosis.\r"

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was detected by 125I-labelled fibrinogen scan in 37 patients (29 per cent) after operation. Pre-operatively, there was diminished euglobulin lysis activity (332 +/- 197 versus 255 +/- 156 min, mean +/- s.d.; P less than 0.025), and tissue plasminogen activator activity (4.2 +/- 9.9 versus 7.7 +/- 14.3 milliunits/ml, mean +/- s.d.; P = 0.094) in patients who subsequently developed postoperative DVT compared with those who did not. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the level of inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator (160.6 +/- 75.4 per cent versus 152.5 +/- 77.5 per cent, mean +/- s.d.; n = 47). Stepwise logistic discriminant analysis of the data obtained preoperatively showed that tissue plasminogen activator, a more specific measure of fibrinolytic activity, was a weaker predictor of DVT than euglobulin lysis time. The results confirm other observations which indicate that lowered fibrinolytic activity is a risk factor for postoperative DVT. In addition, they suggest that this is not due entirely to low levels of activity of tissue plasminogen activator in plasma.\r"

In 47 patients presenting for intravenous nutrition, the wound healing response was less (0.34 +/- 0.23 microgram hydroxyproline/cm of tubing) than that of 36 normally nourished patients (0.49 +/- 0.30 microgram/cm; P less than 0.01). However, it was higher when measured after intravenous feeding had commenced (0.88 +/- 0.62 microgram/cm; P less than 0.005). In 29 patients two sequential studies of wound healing were conducted over a 14-day period of intravenous nutrition. The mean accumulation of hydroxyproline during the first week of intravenous nutrition was 0.36 +/- 0.24 microgram/cm and this was increased significantly over the second week of feeding to 0.78 +/- 0.67 microgram/cm; P less than 0.005. The wound healing response that occurred in wounds made after a period of pre-operative nutrition was better than that which occurred when only postoperative nutrition had been given (P less than 0.02). These results show that the wound healing response in surgical patients requiring intravenous nutrition is improved by this treatment. This improvement is seen after only one week of therapy and before there is an obvious change in nutritional status. It also appears that the improved wound healing response is more marked when intravenous nutrition is given before, rather than after the surgical procedure.\r"

In an initial study of 38 type II diabetic subjects and their first degree relatives six islet cell antibody negative patients with early onset disease (aged 25-40 at diagnosis) were found to have a particularly high familial prevalence of diabetes or glucose intolerance. Nine of 10 parents available for study either had type II diabetes or were glucose intolerant. A high prevalence of diabetes or glucose intolerance was also found in their siblings (11/16;69%). In a second study of the families of a further 10 young diabetic probands (presenting age 25-40) whose islet cell antibody state was unknown a similar high prevalence of diabetes or glucose intolerance was found among parents of the five islet cell antibody negative probands (8/9; 89%) but not among parents of the five islet cell antibody positive probands (3/8;38%). Islet cell antibody negative diabetics with early onset type II disease may have inherited a diabetogenic gene or genes from both parents. They commonly need insulin to maintain adequate glycaemic control and may develop severe diabetic complications. Early onset type II diabetes may represent a syndrome in which characteristic pedigrees, clinical severity, and absence of islet autoimmunity make it distinct from either type I diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young, or late onset type II diabetes.\r"

A Doppler resting pressure index of 0.9 or less was found in 176 legs (21%). Risk factors for arterial impairment included age, ulceration affecting the foot, and a history of claudication, ischaemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Roughly half the patients with arterial impairment also showed the clinical features of chronic venous insufficiency. Careful assessment for arterial disease is mandatory before patients with chronic leg ulcers are treated with elastic compression.\r"

  ".U": "87214939\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred and forty two patients with duodenal ulcer who after a short term study had relief of pain and healed ulcers proved endoscopically were allocated at random to double blind maintenance treatment with enprostil (a synthetic dehydroprostaglandin E2) 35 micrograms or ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime for up to 12 months. Patients were monitored every third month and examined by endoscopy at three, six, and 12 months, or more often if warranted. The cumulative relapse rates in the enprostil group at three, six, and 12 months were 37% (25/67), 56% (37/66), and 62% (41/66), respectively. The corresponding rates in the ranitidine group were 8% (6/71), 19% (13/69), and 29% (20/69). These differences were highly significant and further enhanced by life table analysis adjusting for withdrawals and by an \"intention to treat\" analysis in which absence of proof of non-recurrence was counted as failure, more patients in the enprostil group having been withdrawn because of adverse events or recorded as non-compliant with the protocol. Enprostil 35 micrograms at bedtime cannot be recommended for preventing relapse of duodenal ulcer. Furthermore, the results challenge the clinical relevance of using so called \"cytoprotection\" for preventing recurrence.\r"

Completed questionnaires were received from 25,496 men and 36,657 women registered with 47 group practices in England and Scotland. The proportions of respondents who stated that they had a problem ranged from 1% (women and drinking, n = 406) to 34% (women and weight, n = 12,526). Between 49% (women and drinking, n = 18,048) and 67% (men (n = 17,095) and women (n = 24,550) and weight) thought that their general practitioners should be interested in their lifestyle. The proportions who could recall having received relevant advice ranged from 2% (women and drinking, n = 591) to 24% (women and weight, n = 8946). Advice about smoking had been given to 4055 (40%) of the women and 2941 (39%) of the men who smoked. Only 96 (10%) of the 989 women and 331 (17%) of the 1948 men who drank excessively could recall having received advice about alcohol consumption. These results suggest that patients are concerned about their lifestyle, that most would welcome relevant counselling, and that doctors should become more concerned with prevention of this kind.\r"

While casualty officers were in post referrals for x ray examination did not become more selective, but skills in interpreting films improved. Overall, 4.9% of trauma radiographs were misinterpreted, but this fell from 7.1% to 2.9% during tenure of post. One in four errors was clinically important. Clinical guidelines for selective radiography produced a significant and sustained reduction in the number of x ray examinations requested by the department. Analysis of one common injury indicated that the quality of patient care was not adversely affected. The number of x ray examinations carried out in the accident and emergency department can be reduced by using guidelines, and this does not compromise the quality of patient care. Appreciable savings may be made in patients' waiting times and radiodiagnostic expenditure.\r"

After adjusting for trends in the equivalent weeks in a control year (1985) the increase in the cases of parasuicide treated by hospitals during the experimental week was not found to be significant. A significant increase (31%) was found among people aged greater than or less than 45, but this is not thought to be reliable. The increase among women alone (21%) was significant with a one tailed test. Contrary to expectations there was a positive association between trends in overdose and distance from London--that is, the further the distance of the region from London the greater the increase in cases of overdose during the experimental period--and a negative association between trends in overdose and viewing figures--that is, the higher the viewing figure the less the impact on the incidence of overdoses. These findings do not lend support to the claim that there was a strong imitation effect after this televised parasuicide.\r"

Underlying renal disease and renal failure were less common among pill users than among non-users with malignant hypertension who were of similar age. No pill user became normotensive after withdrawal of the pill, but blood pressure was well controlled (diastolic less than 90 mm Hg) in three patients taking only one drug. By contrast, all 23 non-users needed two or more antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. Ten year survival was 90% among pill users and 50% among non-users. These results suggest that oral contraceptives may be a common cause of malignant hypertension in women of child-bearing age. If the pill is stopped and underlying renal disease excluded the long term prognosis for such patients is excellent.\r"

A classification system based on wheezing frequency was found to correlate well with clinical and spirometric features of airway obstruction. The amount of wheezing in early adolescence seemed to be a guide for severity in later life with 73% of those with few symptoms at 14 continuing to have little or no asthma at 28 years. Similarly 68% of those with frequent wheezing at 14 still suffered from recurrent asthma at 28 years. Most subjects with frequent wheezing at 21 continued to have comparable asthma at 28 years. Of those with infrequent wheezing at 21, 44% had worsened at 28 years. Women fared better than men between 21 and 28 with 19% having worse symptoms compared with 28% of men. Treatment at all ages was generally inadequate. The number of smokers among those with asthma was of concern.\r"

The class gradient for women classified by their husband's occupation was stronger than that when they were classified by their own occupation. Men and women who lacked paid employment reported poorer health than the employed and were concentrated in the lower social classes. Inequalities in ill health due to class were partly caused by the higher proportion in the lower social classes who were without work. Class differences in ill health still existed, however, among the currently employed, with unskilled men reporting particularly poor health and women manual workers reporting poorer health than women in non-manual jobs. Class differences were greater for the occupationless than for the currently employed. Thus class remains an important indicator of health inequalities despite the current high level of unemployment.\r"

The series included a wide range of abuse, including non-accidental injury, failure to thrive, neglect, and emotional deprivation. Two cohorts of children seen during 1974-9 and 1980-5 were compared; these periods were chosen because a large increase in unemployment began in Sheffield in 1980. Although the proportion of the men without work was significantly increased during the second period, this increase could not be ascribed to the rise in either long term or short term unemployment among those who had previously been in regular employment. It was accounted for by a rise in the proportions of single parent families and families in which the resident man had never had regular employment. This may reflect an increase in pregnancies among young mothers. There was no evidence to support the belief that the loss of a job in otherwise stable families leads to an increase in child abuse.\r"

Patients who were attending for a consultation with their general practitioners were recruited to make an appointment with a practice nurse for a health check, and this was compared with ordinary consultations in the control practices. Practices were helped by the facilitator to develop the nurse's role. During the study the increase between intervention and control practices in blood pressure recording was doubled and in the recording of smoking habit it was quadrupled, and there was a fivefold increase in the recording of weight. This model can be applied to other aspects of prevention and general practice care.\r"

These same patients were divided into those in whom no visible endometriosis was present at the second laparoscopy and those in whom residual disease was present and the 12 month cumulative conception rates were 25% (4/16) and 30% (6/20) respectively. None of these rates differed significantly, and they compared with a rate of 23% (6/26) in a control group of patients with unexplained infertility. Those patients in whom the disease was eliminated did not return to normal fertility, though all other causes of infertility were excluded. This study failed to show any impact of treatment or the absence or presence of asymptomatic endometriosis on future fertility compared with patients with unexplained infertility. The findings therefore question any causal role of the disease in infertility.\r"

To see if this might be due to potentiation of the tissue effects of bradykinin the thickness of weals raised by intradermal injection of saline or 1, 3, or 10 micrograms bradykinin was measured before and three times after single doses of captopril, enalapril, or placebo. The mean thickness increased with increasing doses of bradykinin. It did not change with time after the administration of placebo or captopril but increased from 0.61 mm before enalapril to 1.12 mm two and a half hours and 1.06 mm five hours after enalapril was given. Five subjects flushed when given bradykinin after captopril and four after enalapril, but none flushed when given bradykinin after placebo. It is concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate the effects of intradermal bradykinin in vivo and that this may partially explain why they cause angio-oedema in susceptible patients.\r"

Adjustment for age or other prognostic factors produced no significant differences across levels either for coronary care unit care or for combined coronary unit and ward care. Success in resuscitation was also similar across levels. These findings suggest that increased resources for coronary care units--whether for new services or for upgrading existing ones--may not be required.\r"

A preliminary study was therefore carried out of a random sample of council owned residences in a deprived area of Edinburgh, a respondent from consenting households being interviewed to obtain a profile of the physical and mental health of all adults and children. In addition, information was gathered about other factors that might be important, particularly smoking and selective bias in the allocation of tenants to houses. Independent measures of dampness were made by environmental health officers. No conclusive effects of damp on the health of adults were identified. Nevertheless, children living in damp houses, especially where fungal mould was present, had higher rates of respiratory symptoms, which were unrelated to smoking in the household, and higher rates of symptoms of infection and stress. Housing should remain an important public health issue, and the effects of damp warrant further investigation.\r"

After the two years 92% of patients on the list had had blood pressure readings recorded within the previous five years, of which 34% resulted from special prompts and 22% from screening letters. Those who failed to respond to letters were sent questionnaires, and their records were compared with those of screened patients. With the help of a microcomputer it is practicable to sustain a continuous screening rate of between 90% and 95%.\r"

  ".U": "87215055\r", 
  ".W": "Electromyographic (EMG) flexor muscle responses evoked by electrical stimulation of ipsilateral peripheral nerves were studied in 16 patients with clinically complete spinal cord transection. Stimuli were applied either to a cutaneous nerve (sural) or to a mixed nerve (tibial) and muscle responses were recorded from tibialis anterior, biceps femoris and rectus femoris. EMG recordings after both sural and tibial nerve stimulation showed that distinct early and late ipsilateral flexor muscle responses could be elicited. This distinction was more evident for tibialis anterior. The latency of the early responses averaged approximately 100 ms with sural and 75 ms with tibial nerve stimulation. This corresponds to the latency of the flexion withdrawal reflex previously described in normal man. After sural stimulation, the early reflex appeared in biceps femoris at a threshold intensity not significantly different from that in normal man given the same stimulation parameters. Late responses appeared after a longer latency (130 ms) and at a lower threshold than the early flexor reflex. In all patients a striking feature of the late response was that its latency increased with increasing stimulus intensity, the maximum latency being as long as 450 ms. This increase also occurred with increasing duration of high intensity stimulus trains. Neither the appearance of a late response nor its latency increase could be explained by a peripheral loop due to a preceding muscle contraction (from either motor axon stimulation or motoneuronal discharge corresponding to the early flexion reflex). It was therefore concluded that both were directly elicited by the afferent volley set up by electrical stimulation. The low threshold of the late reflex corresponded to the excitation of relatively rapidly conducting afferents and its central spinal delay was more than 100 ms. The late reflexes were compared with those described by Anden et al. (1964) in the acute spinal cat injected with DOPA and were found to have similar characteristics. The mechanism for the increase in latency of the late response is discussed in relation to the interpretation of Lundberg (1979).\r"

  ".W": "Thirty newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease and 30 patients with primary depressive illness showed slowing of response on a computerized digit symbol substitution test when compared with 30 matched normal control subjects. Significant slowing was related, in the parkinsonian patients, to structural brain disorder and affective impairment and, in the depressed patients, to motor impairment. A second computerized test, cognitively simpler but requiring the same motor response, was also administered to each subject. Both cognitive and motor slowing seemed to contribute to slowing of response in the digit symbol test in both parkinsonian and depressed patients. The tests were repeated after about six months in 12 subjects from each group. The parkinsonian patients, on dopaminergic treatment, showed neither significant change in motor or affective impairment, nor improvement in response time for the digit symbol test, but change in response time was related to change in depression rating. The depressed patients, on conventional treatment, showed significant improvement in both affective and motor impairment and improvement in response time for the digit symbol test, due to improvement in cognitive slowing. It is proposed that bradyphrenia in Parkinson's disease and psychomotor retardation in depressive illness are closely related, and that impairment of dopaminergic systems may be involved in both.\r"

A diffusion cell was used to measure the release and the agar well diffusion technique to determine the antibacterial activity of the silver sulphadiazine released. The paraffin cream (15 per cent) preparation had the highest release rate, followed by the homemade cream and the commercially available cream. The antibacterial activity ran parallel with the release results.

Ninety-eight patients with deep burns, varying from 20 per cent to more than 60 per cent of body surface area, were included in this study. The results indicated a general increase in the percentage of patients who gained weight from week to week after week 2 post-burn in all burns categories. An exception was the 60 per cent and more burns category in which an increasing number of patients lost weight until week 4 post-burn. The results of this study and the apparent discrepancy in the above 60 per cent category are presented.\r"

In all cases, the angiographic appearance in the infarct-related artery was that of thrombus in the setting of total or subtotal occlusion. Balloon dilatation without antecedent thrombolytic therapy, was performed in 14 arteries and was successful in establishing reperfusion with reduction of the degree of intraluminal narrowing to less than 50% in all cases. Residual thrombus at the site of inflation was noted in two cases (15%), and embolization was noted in four cases (29%), for an incidence of complication of 44%. In five of six instances in which either residual thrombus or embolization were noted, the initial infarction had occurred greater than 24 h before. In only one of seven cases in which PTCA was used as acute intervention during infarction of less than 4 h duration was the presence of residual thrombus noted after PTCA. Therefore, these findings suggest that thromboembolic complications after PTCA in the setting of recent or acute myocardial infarction are uncommon when the syndrome is less than 4 h duration; however, complications are relatively frequent when infarction has occurred greater than 24 h before. PTCA as a primary intervention in this latter setting should be approached cautiously.\r"

  ".W": "The following study in pregnant ewes was done to examine the effects of ketamine-oxygen anaesthesia on the fetal lamb made acidotic by partial occlusion of the umbilical cord. Fifteen pregnant ewes were instrumented under general anaesthesia to allow continuous measurement of maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure and pulse rate and for withdrawal of arterial blood samples for blood gas analysis. An occlusion loop was loosely secured around the umbilical cord. Following a recovery period of 48 hours, a tracheostomy was performed on each ewe. After a control period, the umbilical occlusion loop was slowly inflated until fetal pH had decreased to 7.12-7.15. Following inflation the animals were divided into groups A and B. Group A received no anaesthesia. In Group B, the ewes received ketamine 3 mg X kg-1 intravenously and controlled ventilation with FIO2 of 1.0. After ten minutes ketamine 1 mg X kg-1 was given. In both groups radioactive microspheres were injected into the fetus at 0, 5, and 15 minutes. Ketamine anaesthesia in the pregnant ewe abolished the fetal hypertension and bradycardia produced by partial cord occlusion. All fetuses survived the 15 minutes of ketamine anaesthesia and there were no significant changes in arterial blood gases or pH. Blood flows determined by the microsphere method to the brain, heart, and kidneys were not significantly altered by ketamine. We conclude that ketamine-oxygen anaesthesia does not cause further deterioration in the acidotic fetal lamb.\r"

DLF were assayed on plasma extracts by digoxin radioimmunoassay (RIA), and by Na,K-ATPase inhibition and [3H]-ouabain displacement using hogbrain Na,K-ATPase. Values for the 3 methods strongly intercorrelated (r = 0.99, p less than .001). Mean values for plasma DLF, assayed by all three methods, were significantly greater in dialysis dependent subjects, than in healthy subjects (p less than .0001). Mean plasma DLF values measured by digoxin RIA in renal transplant recipients, were significantly lower than in dialysis dependent subjects (p less than 0.0001) and higher than in healthy subjects. Plasma DLF values correlated inversely with creatinine clearance (p less than 0.01). Plasma DHEAS levels were significantly lower and contributed substantially less to digoxin antibody reactivity and ouabain displacement in dialysis subjects and in renal transplants compared with healthy subjects. There was no change in plasma immunoreactive DLF, DHEAS or cortisol measured before and after dialysis. DHEAS is a major digoxin like immunoreactive DLF and a minor Na,K-ATPase inhibitor in healthy subjects but makes only a minor contribution to DLF in dialysis and transplant subjects. We found the assays involving Na,K-ATPase inhibition and [3H]-ouabain displacement from Na,K-ATPase to be more sensitive for plasma DLF than the digoxin RIA, but because of the strong correlation between the methods, we suggest the RIA on plasma extracts can be used as a screening procedure.\r"

As previously reported also, the addition of albumin to nephrotic platelet-rich plasmas corrected platelet hyperaggregability to arachidonic acid, but exerted little effect on ristocetin-induced aggregation, and there was no correlation between platelet aggregation thresholds to arachidonate and to ristocetin. Incubation with indomethacin abolished the generation of thromboxane B2 after stimulation with arachidonate, but had no effect on the stimulation with ristocetin, during which no TxB2 was produced. The nephrotic patients had elevated factor VIII-related antigen (Factor VIII R:Ag) concentrations in their plasma, but in addition both decreased serum IgG and platelet-associated IgG were found which were correlated. The hyperaggregability of nephrotic platelets to ristocetin may relate to the elevated factor VIII R:Ag levels, or to the low platelet-associated IgG, since platelet IgG Fc receptors and von Willebrand factor receptors are spatially close or identical.\r"

Although the mechanism is unknown, the pathogenesis is assumed to depend on transformation of mesenchymal cells to bone forming cells in response to a variety of stimuli. The clinical findings, laboratory data, roentgenograms, and radionuclide studies are standard aids in the diagnosis of heterotopic ossification. The treatment usually consists of range-of-motion exercise, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, X-ray therapy, disodium etidronate (EHDP), and excisional surgery. Reported here is a rare case of periarticular heterotopic ossification in the shoulder of a 38-year-old woman following head injury and 13 months in a coma. The unusual feature was the development of a pseudoarthrosis within the heterotopic bone. The patient's shoulder became markedly stiff with the development of a heterotopic pseudoarthrosis. Excision of the heterotopic bone and pseudoarthrosis was performed to improve the range of motion. Clinical roentgenographic, radionuclide, and pathologic observations are presented on the formation of a synovial joint within the heterotopic bone.\r"

No changes were observed in plasma AVP levels and PRA after intracerebroventricular injection of ANP (0.3 nmol/kg). Also no changes were found in BP and HR after intracerebroventricular ANP injection in the dose range 0.01-0.3 nmol/kg. No significant changes were observed in plasma AVP levels after the intravenous administration of ANP at 2.5 nmol/kg to hydrated rats or at 0.1 nmol/kg and 2.5 nmol/kg to dehydrated rats, although the larger dose was sufficient to cause a small fall in BP. Even after 30 min intravenous infusion of ANP at 0.1 nmol min-1 kg-1, a dose sufficient to produce very high plasma ANP levels, no change in plasma AVP could be detected, although haemodynamic changes were observed. Intravenous ANP injection (2.5 nmol/kg) inhibited basal renin secretion in hydrated rats and also inhibited renin secretion which had been stimulated by prior dehydration. From these studies in hydrated and dehydrated rats, there was no evidence that either intracerebroventricular or intravenous ANP administration affected AVP release in vivo.\r"

The rise in plasma ANP was closely related to the amount of sodium retained during the fludrocortisone treatment and the sodium 'escape' occurred by days 4 to 7. These results support the concept that ANP could play an important hormonal role in over-coming the sodium-retaining effects of mineralocorticoids in man.\r"

IFNa has been extensively studied and has demonstrated objective response rates between 15% and 20% when administered in a variety of doses, routes, and schedules. Intermediate dose levels may be associated with greater response rates than low dose levels, and high dose levels are poorly tolerated and usually require dose reduction because of toxicity. Among the means of administration, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes are favored because of logistic advantages; in the low- and intermediate-dose ranges chronic sequential administration (daily, three times a week, or five days per week) is tolerable and may ameliorate toxicity; none of these therapeutic recommendations can be proven to be superior, with respect to response, to several other alternatives. No survival advantage can yet be proven to result from IFN therapy for patients with RCC. Studies evaluating combinations of IFNa and other IFNs or cytotoxic agents have demonstrated increased toxicity. Although responses have been seen in the limited number of studies performed to date, these studies do not appear to support in vivo suggestions of dramatic synergism between these agents. Knowledge of the therapeutic use of IFN is in its infancy. Although the response rates described in this review are unimpressive, they are commensurate with the best available conventional therapy for RCC. As clinical strategies for the use of IFN improve, so too, might the therapeutic efficacy in RCC improve.\r"

This article evaluates the efficacy, safety, and cost of HDHE for abdominal, pelvic, thoracic, and total hip surgical prophylaxis. Although several controlled trials comparing HDHE to minidose heparin (MDH) indicate superior efficacy of HDHE for nonorthopedic surgical procedures, others do not. Differences in study design and insufficient sample sizes may account for the dichotomy. In the U.S. Multicenter Trial, MDH was surprisingly ineffective for preventing radiofibrinogen uptake test-proven DVT. The apparent superiority of HDHE over MDH is therefore questionable. Ergot-related side effects have been minimized in all studies due to careful patient selection. In actual use, the potential for such side effects appears to be increased. Because twice-daily HDHE is no more effective, costs 4-11 times more, and may pose a greater risk than MDH, the authors do not recommend its use for general surgical prophylaxis. HDHE may prove to be useful in patients undergoing total hip replacement.\r"

Cell cultures were exposed for 4 days to phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or valproic acid. Anticonvulsant concentrations added to the media were selected to produce free levels in the cell media that were equivalent to free levels in humans ranging from therapeutic to very toxic. Free levels of anticonvulsants in the toxic range affected cell number, protein content, and neurochemical markers. However, only valproic acid and phenytoin reduced cell growth at therapeutic free drug concentrations. Valproic acid was the only medication to act as a differentiating agent, significantly increasing the activity of choline acetyltransferase, beta-galactosidase, and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding. These results emphasize the importance of performing drug studies at appropriate free drug concentrations and suggest that valproic acid differs from other commonly prescribed anticonvulsants by having both a growth-suppressing and a differentiating effect.\r"

In this study, we examined postictal chronological changes in both immunoreactive TRH (IR-TRH) and TRH receptor binding activity in discrete brain regions of AM-kindled rats to study the relationship of the brain TRH system to kindling-induced seizure susceptibility. AM-kindled rats were decapitated 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and 21 days after the last kindled convulsion. IR-TRH increased markedly in the AM/pyriform cortex and hippocampus 24 and 48 h after the last convulsion, and returned to the control (unstimulated, sham-operated) value within 3 weeks after the convulsions ended. In contrast, a significant increase in the striatal TRH binding sites was evident 24 h after the cessation of convulsions which lasted 21 days. A lasting change in the striatal TRH neural system may be related to kindling-induced seizure susceptibility.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) as an aid to diagnosis of seizure disorders is established, but its role as a guide to monitoring treatment is much less certain. For those patients with classical absences and 3-s spike wave activity there is a very close correlation between control of clinically detected seizures and EEG events. In some, but not all, patients with other seizure disorders there is a positive correlation between numbers of seizures and amount of interictal epileptiform activity (IEA). Intravenous benzodiazepines and phenytoin result in both acute seizure control and suppression of IEA. For seizures other than absences, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) given in the medium and long term, there is generally not a clear relationship between control of seizures and IEA. In studies of children whose epilepsy is in remission, persistent IEA has been associated with a higher risk of seizure relapse should AEDs be discontinued, but in adults the relevance of persistent IEA appears to be much less certain. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates result in increased fast activity. All AEDs may result in slowing of the dominant rhythm and increased slow activity. Carbamazepine, in particular, is often associated with apparent deterioration of background activity, even in the face of clinical improvement. Further studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms and significance of AED-induced changes in EEG background activity.\r"

Chronic administration (15 days) of FBM (150 mg/kg i.p.) in mice had no significant effect on either intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold or hexobarbital sleep time; however, hexobarbital sleep time was significantly increased after a single dose. Chronic administration (5-7 days) of FBM (48 or 95 mg/kg orally) in rats also had no significant effect on either maximal electroshock seizure activity or hexobarbital sleep time. Chronic administration of FBM at 238 mg/kg slightly decreased anti-subcutaneous PTZ activity in chronically treated rats (one of eight protected) as compared with those receiving only a single dose (three of eight protected), but there was no significant change in hexobarbital sleep time. Chronic treatment of rats for 7 days with 48 mg/kg had no significant effect on any hepatic parameters. However, 95 or 238 mg/kg of FBM significantly increased p-nitroanisole O-demethylase activity. It is concluded that the increased hexobarbital sleep time induced by an acute dose of FBM reflects the CNS-depressant effect of the substance. The increased p-nitroanisole O-demethylase activity observed after chronic administration may be indicative of some liver microsomal induction. Overall, FBM in doses ranging from 48 to 238 mg/kg appears to have minimal potential for tolerance development.\r"

In BB/W diabetic rats and in rats with SS-D, indices of IAP were significantly increased in tissues and vessels predisposed to diabetic vascular disease in humans, including the eyes (anterior uvea, posterior uvea, and retina), sciatic nerve, aorta, kidney, and new vessels formed after induction of diabetes. No evidence of increased IAP was observed in heart, brain, testes, or skeletal muscle in BB/W or SS-D rats. In MS-D rats, indices of IAP were increased only in the kidney and in new vessels formed after the onset of diabetes. Marked tissue differences were observed in the effects of two structurally different aldose reductase inhibitors (sorbinil and tolrestat) and of castration on diabetes-induced increases in IAP and in tissue levels of polyols in SS-D rats. Both aldose reductase inhibitors and castration completely prevented diabetes-induced increases in IAP in new vessels and in sciatic nerve in BB/W and SS-D rats. Both aldose reductase inhibitors also markedly decreased IAP in the anterior uvea (approximately 85%), posterior uvea (approximately 65-75%), retina (approximately 65-70%), and kidney (approximately 70-100%); castration reduced IAP in the anterior uvea (approximately 55%), kidney (approximately 50%), and retina (approximately 30%) but had no effect on the posterior uvea. The diabetes-induced increases in IAP in the aorta were reduced only slightly (approximately 20%) by aldose reductase inhibitors and castration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies have shown conflicting variations in Na+-K+-ATPase activity or Na+-K+ pump concentration of muscle cells in experimental diabetes. Our study demonstrates that early untreated diabetes in rats induced by injection of streptozocin is associated with decreases in [3H]ouabain binding-site concentration of 24-48% in various skeletal muscles and 16% in peripheral nerves as well as a decrease in K+-dependent 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase activity of 21% in the heart ventricle. These effects could be prevented by insulin treatment. They probably represent a decrease in the concentration of Na+-K+ pumps. There was no evidence for more than one population of Na+-K+ pumps in intact samples of skeletal muscle and nerves from normal, diabetic, and insulin-treated animals. The decrease in Na+-K+ pump concentration in nerve cells may be due to atrophy of the axons. In skeletal muscles, myocardium, and peripheral nerves, the observed decrease in Na+-K+ pump concentration may be important for the pathophysiology of diabetes. We emphasize that quantification of Na+-K+-ATPase or the Na+-K+ pump in muscle and nerve tissue from diabetic animals should preferably be performed with either intact samples or crude homogenates of whole tissue.\r"

Enzyme inhibition studies with this monoclonal antibody showed inhibition of human liver UDPGTase activity with bilirubin, 4-methylumbelliferone, and 4-nitrophenol as substrates. Testosterone, estrone, and phenolphthalein UDPGTase activity was not inhibited. The monoclonal antibody probably recognizes the uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronic acid binding site at 4-nitrophenol UDPGTase. Proteins with a molecular mass of 54,000 daltons were immunopurified from solubilized human liver using the monoclonal antibody as ligand coupled to Sepharose 4B beads. The distribution of UDPGTase isoforms in various human tissues was studied by immunofluorescence. The enzyme could be detected in liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, colon, and skin. In liver, only hepatocytes contain UDPGTase. In kidney, the enzyme was localized exclusively in proximal tubuli and in stomach in epithelial mucous cells. In small intestinal epithelium, maximal fluorescence was seen at the villous tip. In colon, all lining epithelial cells were stained. In colon polyps, staining for UDPGTase was clearly decreased, and in colon carcinoma it was undetectable. In skin, the stratum corneum was intensely stained, whereas the stratum basale showed no fluorescence.\r"

We noted that the gastrostomy tube was successfully placed in 299 (95%) of the 314 patients. Ninety-three percent (n = 291) of the patients had the procedure performed in the hospital and 7% (n = 23) were outpatients when the procedure was performed. In those patients with stable underlying conditions, the procedure can safely be performed in the outpatient setting. A low rate of procedure-related mortality (1%), major complication (3%), and minor complication (13%) was noted. Our experience suggests that the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is safe and has a low mortality rate even in patients who are medically debilitated secondary to their underlying disease.\r"

  ".U": "87219739\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin on gastric acid secretion were studied in 8 healthy men. Oral doses of indomethacin (200 mg), administered 15 and 2 h before testing, were known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by 90% in 3 of the subjects as determined by prostaglandin E2 generation assay on endoscopically obtained gastric mucosal biopsy specimens. Acid-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion was evaluated in a randomized and blinded study in which acid output was measured for 2 h during basal conditions by aspiration, for the next 2 h by intragastric titration during distention with isotonic glucose, and for the following 2 h by intragastric titration during meal stimulation with peptone. The studies were done on separate days, and intragastric pH was maintained at either 2.5 or 5.5 after administration of indomethacin or placebo. Basal acid output was not altered by indomethacin treatment. Distention of the stomach stimulated acid output significantly to a similar degree in all groups, without affecting plasma gastrin. Meal stimulation increased plasma gastrin and acid output significantly more at pH 5.5 (47 +/- 12 pM, 13 +/- 2 mmol/30 min) than at pH 2.5 (30 +/- 8 pM, 6 +/- 2 mmol/30 min). No effect of indomethacin treatment was observed. It is concluded that the participation of cyclooxygenase products in the mechanisms by which acid inhibits the gastric phase of acid secretion in humans is likely to be minor. These results also cast doubt on an important physiologic role for cyclooxygenase products in the regulation of basal acid secretion or of acid secretion stimulated by distention or a peptone meal.\r"

Protamine prevented the heparin effect and reestablished the original migration pattern of the atrial peptides. The addition of heparin to either rat or human plasma samples did not interfere with the atriopeptin immunoreactivity. The influence of heparin on the biological activity of the atriopeptin-28 in anesthetized rats was also investigated. Infusion of heparin (30 U/min) significantly reduced the dose-dependent fall of blood pressure produced by atriopeptin-28, but did not interfere with the hypotensive effect of nitroglycerin. Similarly, infusion of heparin in volume-expanded rats markedly decreased the diuresis produced by atriopeptin-28 without altering the urine volume excreted in response to furosemide. These data suggest that the highly charged molecule heparin can modify the physical and biological properties of atriopeptins, perhaps by binding to the numerous arginine residues (i.e., 5 arginine residues in atriopeptin-28) in the atriopeptin molecules.\r"

The rate of progesterone secretion by the trophoblastic tissue was 47.5 +/- 5.0 (+/- SE) ng/mg cell protein X h (control) at 450 micrograms low density lipoprotein/mL. The rates of progesterone production and cAMP accumulation were accelerated 3.0- and 1.7-fold, respectively, by 10(-5) M terbutaline, and the terbutaline effect was blocked by the addition of 50 microM N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7) or 50 microM trifluoperazine. Whereas progesterone secretion by placental explants cultured in medium containing low density lipoprotein with 1 microM A23187 (calcium ionophore) reached a rate of 128.5 +/- 8.5 ng/mg cell protein X h, incubation of placental explants with A23187 caused a highly significant, dose-related decrease in terbutaline-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Inhibition by A23187 was Ca2+ dependent, since incubation in a Ca2+-free medium with EGTA blocked its effect. Intracellular Ca2+ is apparently necessary for placental progesterone production; enhancement of progesterone production by beta2-stimulation is mediated by intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, bromocriptine has been proposed as a novel agent for the treatment of excessively tall stature in adolescents. To further test its value, we treated nine boys, aged 10.0-15.4 yr, for 1 yr with bromocriptine (7.5 mg/day). A paradoxical plasma GH response to TRH was demonstrated in four of eight boys before and in five boys after 6 months of bromocriptine treatment. At the onset of therapy, the mean adult height prediction was 202.2 +/- 4.3 (+/- SD) cm (Bayley-Pinneau), 202.1 +/- 4.7 cm (TW Mark II), and 198.6 +/- 5.3 cm (Roche-Wainer-Thissen). After 1 yr of therapy, the mean adult height prediction had changed by -4.5 +/- 2.6 cm (Bayley-Pinneau), -3.4 +/- 2.2 cm (TW Mark II), and -2.6 +/- 1.2 cm (Roche-Wainer-Thissen). These reductions were solely due to a decrease in growth velocity and not to an increased skeletal maturation rate. To substantiate these findings, each treated boy was pair-matched with an untreated tall boy so that their chronological and skeletal ages differed by less than 1 yr. After 1 yr of follow-up, height predictions in the treated boys compared with those in the matched control boys gave significantly reduced results with the Bayley-Pinneau and the Roche-Wainer-Thissen, but not with the TW Mark II, method. Because of this discrepancy it is uncertain whether final height in tall boys will really be reduced by treatment with bromocriptine.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained after bolus iv injection of 10 micrograms GnRH. After sc injection, plasma GnRH levels rose to a dose-related maximum after 5-10 min and fell to less than 10% of the peak value by 90 min. The mean plasma disappearance half-time was 24 min (range, 18-30 min). After bolus iv injection, an initial rapid phase of disappearance (t1/2, 2.8 min) was followed by a slower phase (t1/2, 33 min), falling within the 95% confidence intervals for the disappearance half-time after sc administration (12-36 min). The patterns of LH response to sc and iv GnRH were similar, with maximum levels reached between 20 and 30 min after injection, then declining to 50-69% of the peak value by 90 min after sc injection and 61% of the peak value 90 min after iv injection. There was no significant difference between peak LH responses to 10 micrograms iv and sc doses of GnRH [15.2 +/- 2.5 (+/- SEM) vs. 13.2 +/- 2.2 IU/L]. Subcutaneous administration of three consecutive GnRH pulses at 90-min intervals to four women resulted in gonadotropin responses to each GnRH pulse. We conclude that sc GnRH administration results in pulsatile plasma GnRH and gonadotropin responses, the latter resembling those seen after iv GnRH. These results confirm the suitability of the sc route for pulsatile GnRH delivery.\r"

We evaluated the effect of leuprolide acetate, a long-acting GnRH agonist, on serum gonadotropin and sex steroid concentrations before and during human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) induction of ovulation in women with PCO. In this controlled prospective randomized study, leuprolide was administered daily for 4 weeks, followed by concomitant hMG administration. Gonadotropin and steroid hormone concentrations were compared with those during ovulation induction cycles in women with PCO receiving hMG only. Daily administration of leuprolide for 4 weeks resulted in significantly decreased serum LH, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations, but no change in serum progesterone, FSH, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Compared to ovulation induction using hMG alone, leuprolide administration before and during hMG treatment prevented preovulatory rises in serum LH and P concentrations, while having no effect on serum FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. We conclude that leuprolide administered to women with PCO decreases gonadal steroid production and is capable of preventing premature luteinization during hMG induction of ovulation.\r"

All cell types were shown to have the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and to increase activity in response to DNA strand breaks. Incubation of susceptible cells with 1 microM dexamethasone resulted in DNA strand breaks. Susceptible cells also showed a dose-dependent decrease in NAD and ATP that preceded loss of cell viability.

Diabetes enhanced 3OMG absorption fivefold in ileum and threefold in jejunum; ALA absorption increased twofold in ileum but not at all in jejunum; ileal SO4 transport was unaffected. Increases in 3OMG and ALA transport were due solely to increases in maximum velocity. The enhancement of ileal glucose absorption was half-maximal in 40-45 d, could be reversed by 10 d of treatment with insulin and did not result from adrenergic denervation. The density of glucose carriers per milligram brush border protein (measured as [3H]phlorizin binding sites) was not altered but there was a sixfold increase in the number of glucose-inhibitable [3H]phlorizin-binding sites in the intact epithelium. Generalized mucosal hypertrophy accounted for less than 30% of this increase. We conclude that the intestine adapts to streptozocin-induced diabetes through recruitment of additional brush border carriers for sugar, probably in the midvillus-to-crypt region.\r"

A distinct 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) peak was noted when [14C]arachidonic acid ([14C]AA) was added to the mixed cell preparations which was increased by pretreating platelets with 1-benzylimidazole (1-BI). Lymphocytes prelabeled with [14C]AA failed to form 6KPGF1 alpha when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or ionophore A23187. When the prelabeled platelets were suspended together with aspirin-treated lymphocytes and stimulated with ionophore, thrombin, or collagen, a 6KPGF1 alpha peak was detected and enhanced by 1-BI. These results were supported by quantifying the 6KPGF1 alpha content in the HPLC-purified fraction by RIA. Adding prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) directly to lymphocytes led to 6KPGF1 alpha production. Platelet aggregation and release were inhibited by lymphocytes in a dose-related manner. We conclude that lymphocytes possess PGI2 synthase activity which is capable of converting platelet-derived PGH2 into PGI2. PGI2 formed is sufficient to inhibit platelet function.\r"

Ouabain-resistant Rb/K influx was also greater than in normal controls or patients with sickle cell trait. Deoxygenation of SS erythrocytes increased ouabain-sensitive Rb/K influx without altering ouabain binding, presumably as the consequence of an increase in the passive influx of sodium. Deoxygenation increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) by 5.5%, and studies of the density distribution of SS cells indicated an increase in highly dense fractions known to contain sickled erythrocytes. Ouabain prevented the rise in MCHC and reduced the percentage of dense cells. These findings indicate a magnified role for the sodium-potassium pump in the pathophysiology of SS erythrocytes and suggest that its inhibition might prove useful in therapy.\r"

In response to streptokinase (SK) and rt-PA, 264 +/- 54 and 95 +/- 12 mg/dl respectively of fibrinogen was converted to fragment X. By immunoblotting, fragment X was demonstrated as early as 5 min after SK and 30 min after rt-PA, and was still evident 24 h after treatment. Patients treated with SK showed extensive further plasmin degradation of fragment X to fragments Y and D. Thus fragment X concentrations tend to be more similar in the two groups than would be expected from the extent of fibrinogen breakdown. Fragment X forms clots, but these have lower tensile strength and are more susceptible to further plasmin lysis than clots of fibrin. Thus the similar bleeding observed in the two treatment groups might be a reflection of their similar plasma fragment X concentrations.\r"

In these experiments, we show that calcitriol also markedly inhibited production of the lymphokine, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), by activated human T lymphocytes. Regulation of both IL-2 and IFN-gamma production as well as transferrin receptor (TfR) expression by calcitriol was apparent at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level as determined by Northern blotting. The decrease in IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA that occurred with calcitriol treatment was coordinate and not apparent up to 12 h after phytohemagglutinin stimulation, whereas decreased accumulation of TfR mRNA was not present before 24-36 h. Furthermore, the effects of calcitriol on IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TfR mRNA accumulation were specific; actin mRNA accumulation was comparable between control and treated cells. These data indicate that calcitriol regulated proteins associated with T cell activation at the transcriptional level and that these effects were mediated in a specific, coordinate fashion.\r"

Biosynthetic forms of acid alpha-glucosidase with different molecular mass were separated electrophoretically and identified by immunoblotting. Immuno-electron microscopy was employed to determine the intracellular localization of mutant enzyme. Our studies illustrate that maturation of acid alpha-glucosidase is associated with transport to the lysosomes. Deficiency of catalytically active mature enzyme in lysosomes is common to all clinical phenotypes but, in the majority of cases, is more profound in early onset than in late onset forms of the disease. Thus, the results suggest that the clinical course of glycogenosis type II is primarily determined by the amount of functional acid alpha-glucosidase. The role of secondary factors can, however, not be excluded because three adult patients were identified with very low activity and little enzyme in the lysosomes.\r"

  ".W": "We show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3), the most hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D3, modulates sensitively and specifically both the protein and messenger RNA accumulation of the multilineage growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The regulation of GM-CSF expression is seen in both normal human mitogen-activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line (S-LB1) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). In contrast, cells from a HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocyte line (Ab-VDR) established from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1,25(OH)2D3 cellular receptors are resistant to the action of 1,25(OH)2D3. Inhibition of GM-CSF expression by 1,25(OH)2D3 can occur independently of interleukin 2 regulation and is probably mediated through cellular 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. We conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 may be important in the physiology of hematopoiesis.\r"

When added to a suspension of human platelets induced to aggregate in plasma with adenosine 5'-diphosphate, t-PA promoted disaggregation of platelets over several minutes. Addition of fresh plasma or purified human fibrinogen to disaggregated platelets facilitated (reversible) aggregation and subsequent disaggregation. Aspirin treatment of platelets markedly potentiated the ability of t-PA to induce disaggregation. Disaggregation was inhibited by alpha-2-antiplasmin. Comparative analysis of the rate of proteolysis of platelet-bound fibrinogen with that of ambient plasma fibrinogen suggested that fibrinogenolysis of cohesive fibrinogen occurred more rapidly than fibrinogenolysis of ambient fibrinogen. These data demonstrate that t-PA facilitates platelet disaggregation in plasma through kinetically selective proteolysis of cohesive fibrinogen by plasmin, and suggest that thrombolytic mechanisms may serve both to remove platelets from platelet-fibrin thrombi and to disperse circulating platelet aggregates.\r"

The present study was designed to investigate whether the abnormally prolonged post-ASA BT in uremia is due to different ASA pharmacokinetics and bioavailability that might be a consequence of uremic condition, platelet cyclooxygenase is peculiarly sensitive to ASA in uremia, and ASA affects primary hemostasis in uremia by a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Our results showed that in patients with uremia, but not in normal subjects, ASA markedly prolongs the BT. This effect is transient and depends on the presence of ASA in the blood. The observed differences in ASA kinetic parameters are not an explanation of the exaggerated effect of ASA on primary hemostasis in uremia. The sensitivity of platelet cyclooxygenase to ASA inhibition is comparable in uremics and in normal subjects. The temporal dissociation between ASA-induced prolongation of BT and the effect on platelet thromboxane A2 generation suggests that ASA inhibits platelet function in uremia by a mechanism distinct from cyclooxygenase blocking. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that ibuprofen at a dose that fully inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase activity does not significantly prolong BT.\r"

Basal and catecholamine-induced glycerol release were positively correlated with age when lipolysis was expressed per cell. However, when lipolysis was expressed per unit of cell surface area (micrometer squared), this correlation was observed only for noradrenaline. Basal lipolysis and the effect of the pure beta-agonist, isoprenaline, were identical in infants and adults. From 0 to 2 mo of age noradrenaline had very little lipolytic effect. The addition of the alpha-2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, to noradrenaline equalized lipolysis per micrometer squared in infants and adults and the alpha-2-adrenoceptor sensitivity was significantly enhanced in infants. In both groups the lipolytic adrenoceptor was of the beta-1 type. In conclusion, adipocytes from infants have a poor lipolytic response to noradrenaline partly because of the small fat cells but mainly because of an enhanced alpha-2-adrenoceptor activity.\r"

Analysis of tissue phosphatidylcholine by mass spectrometric techniques revealed metabolism of PAF to 1-0-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC, which represented 20-23% of the administered radiolabeled hexadecyl-PAF. These findings support the hypothesis that a relationship between PAF and arachidonate metabolism exists at the intact organ level.

Expression of HLA class II antigens on U937/HIV cells was decreased 2- to 10-fold, depending on the Mab used. Class II expression of U937/HIV cells increased approximately two-fold by treatment with r-interferon-gamma. Whereas noninfected U937 cells expressed moderate amounts of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (CD11a) and minimal amounts of the C3bi receptor (CD11b) and p150/95 (CD11c), U937/HIV cells expressed moderate amounts of C3bi receptor and p150/95 and showed elevated expression of LFA-1 alpha (CD11a) and -beta (CD18) chains. Expression of these adhesion molecules resulted in strongly enhanced phorbolester-induced aggregation of U937/HIV cells compared with the noninfected U937 cells. In addition, almost all U937/HIV cells, but not noninfected U937 cells, intensely stained for cytoplasmic nonspecific esterase activity. The effects of HIV infection on U937 cells strikingly resemble the effects of differentiation-inducing agents, such as PMA and DMSO, on the U937 phenotype. Our finding suggests that HIV infection, apart from down regulating class II expression, induces differentiation of U937 cells.\r"

  ".W": "A large proportion of disease caused by sulphonamide resistant strains of group B type 15 meningococci affects patients 10-24 years. In contrast, disease caused by sulphonamide sensitive strains conforms to the usual pattern, and most infection occurs in early childhood. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon possible differences in susceptibility of resistant and sensitive strains to phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leucocytes were investigated, using radioactively labelled bacteria. In initial experiments a group B resistant strain required higher concentrations of normal human serum and longer opsonisation times for phagocytosis than an ungroupable non-pathogenic meningococcus. Comparison of sulphonamide resistant and sensitive group B meningococci showed that with either heat inactivated serum or agammaglobulinaemic serum, phagocytosis did not occur with any of the strains, whereas if these two sera were used together, phagocytosis was restored to the level seen with normal human serum. Thus both antibody and complement are required for phagocytosis. Furthermore, opsonisation depended on an intact classical pathway of complement for each group B strain. In all the experiments there was no significant difference between the phagocytosis of sulphonamide sensitive and resistant group B strains neither with regard to the efficiency of opsonisation by normal human serum nor the exact requirements for antibody and complement.\r"

Similar concentrations of latex agglutinating antigen were produced by these strains in vivo. Positive reactions were also given by C sporogenes, proteolytic C botulinum Types A, B, and A/F, and Bacteroides assaccharolyticus. The latex agglutinating antigen was denatured by boiling for 10 minutes, but not by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes. The reaction was abolished by incubation of test material with crude C difficile antitoxin but not with other clostridial antitoxins or specific antitoxin to C difficile toxin A. The latex agglutinating antigen present in C difficile eluted between 0.39% and 0.47% M sodium chloride, and that produced by the other clostridia, between 0.35% and 0.43% M sodium chloride by fast protein liquid chromatography. The latex agglutinating antigen of C difficile was neither cytotoxic nor mouse lethal and was distinct from toxin A and toxin B. In the analysis of faecal specimens from patients with diarrhoea the latex agglutination test correlated better with the presence of C difficile than with toxin B and detected both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. The latex agglutination test should only be used in the laboratory as an alternative to culture for C difficile and not as a method for the detection of C difficile toxins.\r"

At 3.6 +/- 1.2 hours (mean +/- SD) from symptom onset, patients received either intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (1.25 mg/kg body weight over 3 hours) or placebo on a 3:1 randomized, double-blind basis. Coronary angiography, performed 68 +/- 13 minutes after initiation of the study drug infusion, demonstrated patency of the infarct-related artery in 40 (57%) of 70 patients in the tissue plasminogen activator group compared with 3 (13%) of 23 patients in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Patients in the placebo group were then eligible to receive intracoronary streptokinase. At 90 minutes the patency was observed in 49 (69%) of 71 tissue plasminogen activator patients compared with 5 (24%) of 21 placebo patients (p less than 0.001). At 120 minutes patency was observed in 59 (79%) of 75 patients of the tissue plasminogen activator group and in 10 (40%) of 25 in the intracoronary streptokinase/placebo group. A nadir value of less than 100 mg/dl fibrinogen occurred in 8 (11%) of 73 patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator versus 8 (40%) of 20 patients treated with intracoronary streptokinase (p = 0.002). Moderate or severe bleeding episodes occurred in 39% of patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator compared with 32% of patients who received placebo/intracoronary streptokinase (p = NS). Thus, this tissue plasminogen activator preparation achieves a high rate of recanalization and, at the doses employed, exhibits increased fibrinogen sparing compared with intracoronary streptokinase.\r"

Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and during therapy with tocainide alone, quinidine alone and a combination of tocainide and quinidine. During single drug therapy, the dose of tocainide was 1,680 +/- 437 mg/day and that of quinidine was 1,340 +/- 235 mg/day. During combination therapy, with smaller doses of tocainide (1,350 +/- 394 mg/day) and quinidine (1,060 +/- 268 mg/day) in many patients, no patient had side effects. At baseline before therapy, the mean ventricular premature complexes/h were 629 +/- 567, couplets/h were 23.9 +/- 29.7 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias/24 h were 60.5 +/- 152.2. Compared with baseline values (100%), the frequency of ventricular premature complexes was reduced to 33 +/- 44% with quinidine, 39 +/- 30% with tocainide and 10 +/- 16% with combination therapy (p less than 0.01 for combination versus quinidine or tocainide alone; p = NS for quinidine versus tocainide). Individually, an effective regimen (greater than 83% reduction of ventricular premature complexes and abolition of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was found in 3 (15%) of 20 patients receiving tocainide alone, in 6 (30%) receiving quinidine alone and in 16 (80%) receiving combination therapy (p less than 0.01 for tocainide versus combination, quinidine versus combination; p = NS for tocainide versus quinidine). Thus, the antiarrhythmic effects of quinidine and tocainide are additive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pump failure, ranging from ventricular dysfunction to acute cardiogenic shock, is now the leading cause of cardiac death. Efforts at temporary mechanical or pharmacologic support of the heart have been largely unsuccessful so that attention is now directed toward prevention of ventricular failure and limitation of myocardial infarct size or even outright prevention of infarction itself. In particular, attention has been refocused on earlier reperfusion efforts with streptokinase. The effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial (Netherlands Interuniversity Cardiology Institute). Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hours after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Of the patients eligible for this detailed analysis, 245 were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiography was preformed in 212 of the 245 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 versus 1,179 U/liter in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% versus 43% in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Twelve month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (8% versus 16% in the control group, p less than 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis infarct size limitation, improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction and 3 month mortality were predicted by sigma ST, time from onset of symptoms to admission and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most useful in patients admitted within 2 hours after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sigma ST segment of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with sigma ST less than 1.2 mV, admitted 2 to 4 hours after onset of symptoms.\r"

Coincident with increases in serum transaminase activities indicative of acute hepatitis, serum IgG levels continued to rise to 506 mg/dl. When plasma replacement therapy was stopped, a transient decline in IgG level (to 371 mg/dl) was produced, followed by a sharp increase in IgG to 607 mg/dl. During this period, the patient's T4/T8 ratio, which had been inverted (0.89), exhibited significant normalization to 1.57. Nevertheless, the patient failed to produce specific antibody after immunization with a number of defined antigens. The mechanism whereby this presumed non-A, non-B hepatitis augmented endogenous IgG production in this patient remains unknown but may be related to diminished suppressor T cell activity. The patient's inability to produce specific antibody during this period suggests an underlying defect in one or more lymphocyte subsets involved in either helper T cell activity and/or immunologic memory.\r"

T cell responses to mitogen were examined both in high density, conventional bulk cultures and by limiting dilution analysis. Long-lasting deficits in the frequency of functional T cells were observed, for both IL 2-producing and cytotoxic cells, in proportion to the severity of the graft-vs-host disease induced. These deficits did not reflect a corresponding loss of Thy-1+ cells nor a loss of function in conventional cultures in mice studied at later times after bone marrow transplantation. These deficits in reactive cells are not completely correctable with IL 2, and provide further insight into the nature of T cell reconstitution of the immune system after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

The xid markedly reduced spontaneous IgM secretion by spleen cells, serum IgM, anti-ssDNA antibodies, anti-bromelain-treated-erythrocyte antibodies, and T cell binding (but not thymocytotoxic) antibodies; however, neither phenotype nor mortality was affected, suggesting that other factors are responsible for early death. Marked expansion of the Ly-1+ B cell pool was prevented by xid in the motheaten mouse leaving only a very small population of sIgM-positive B cells. This failure of non-Ly-1+ B cell development in me/me X xid mice suggests that me/me leads to inhibition of non-Ly-1+ B cells and preferential expansion of Ly-1+ B cells in motheaten mice, perhaps as a result of their high levels of maturation and activation factors.\r"

  ".W": "The development of natural killer (NK) cells from bone marrow (BM) precursors was studied. Recombinant interleukin 2 (IL 2) was able to induce the in vitro development of NK cells when added to cultures of mouse BM cells. Treatment of donor mice with 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg i.v.), which eliminates more differentiated cells but spares less differentiated cells, appears to augment NK cell development. The \"NK stem cell\" was found to be asialo GM1-, Thy-1+, Lyt-2-, and Lyt-1-. The cells generated in vitro had a typical phenotype of NK cells, being asialo GM1+, Lyt-5+, Thy-1+, Lyt-2-, and Lyt-1-. These effector cells also had specificity characteristics of NK cells lysing the NK-susceptible YAC-1 and K562 targets, but not the NK-resistant EL/4 or allogeneic and syngeneic blasts. Hemopoietin-1 (H-1), a factor which acts on very primitive multipotent BM cells, was able to cooperate with IL 2, increasing the development of NK cells. In contrast, other factors such as interleukin 3 or colony-stimulating factor did not cause induction of NK activity when added to cultures of BM cells, indicating that this effect, i.e., induction of NK cell development, is peculiar to IL 2. These results indicate that IL 2 can act as a differentiation as well as growth factor for NK cells, and that H-1 can promote the development of functional activity in a lymphocyte subpopulation as well as affect the differentiation of myelomonocytic and other cell lineages. This experimental system appears quite useful for characterization of BM precursors for NK cells, and should help to better understand the relationship of the NK cell lineage to the T cell or other lineages.\r"

Similarly, it has been proposed that the precursor cells for LAK activity are phenotypically distinct from NK cells. In most precursor studies, phenotype comparisons have been made between fresh NK cells and LAK cells which have been generated by 3 to 5 days of culture in IL 2. In the present study, we utilized positive selection with monoclonal antibodies to characterize the surface phenotype of precursor cells which give rise to rIL 2-augmented NK activity within 24 hr and to classically generated LAK activity which appears after 3 to 5 days of culture in rIL 2. The results demonstrated that highly purified (93 to 95%) Lyt-2+ or L3T4+ T lymphocytes were unable to generate appreciable amounts of either augmented NK activity or LAK activity when cultured with rIL 2, whereas the highly purified (98%) Lyt-2-, L3T4-, asialo GM1+ lymphocyte subset gave rise to both augmented NK and LAK activities. These findings demonstrate that both augmented NK and LAK activities can arise from precursors expressing the same phenotype. Overall, the results suggest that NK cells in mouse spleen constitute a major precursor component for the generation of LAK activity from that organ.\r"

  ".W": "Cloned murine cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) having defined specificity were triggered by the phorbol ester together with a calcium ionophore (either A23187 or Ionomycin) to lyse syngeneic or third party target cells efficiently. Neither phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) nor calcium ionophore alone induced efficient lysis. The characteristics of the lytic process induced by these signals are similar to those of antigen-specific or lectin-facilitated lysis by CTL. Lysis is calcium and temperature dependent and shows kinetics which are not grossly different from lysis mediated via the antigen receptor. Two helper T lymphocyte clones were not induced to lyse efficiently EL-4 target cells by concanavalin A or PMA + ionophore. Triggering of lysis induced with PMA plus ionophore by the CTL clone L3 differed from antigen-mediated lysis in specificity and in the susceptibility to inhibition by cytochalasin B. Properties of the target cell determine which cell surface associative recognition structures are important in the efficient lysis of these cells. Anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies inhibited efficiently both antigen-mediated and PMA + ionophore-induced lysis of P-815 or EL-4 target cells which are of hematopoietic origin. However, anti-LFA-1 antibodies do not inhibit antigen-mediated, lectin-facilitated, or PMA + Ionomycin-induced CTL cytolysis of target cells derived from the L cell fibroblast line. We conclude that two intracellular signals, which can be provided by the combination of PMA + ionophore, are required for efficient lysis by antigen-specific murine CTL clones. When the T cell receptor for antigen is bypassed using PMA + ionophore to trigger lysis, we show that Lyt-2 and LFA-1 molecules may be required for efficient lysis. These associative recognition structures appear to play an important role in postactivation steps leading to efficient delivery of the lethal hit to the target cell.\r"

  ".U": "87223997\r", 
  ".W": "A common prediction of clonal deletion/inactivation hypotheses is that cells with high avidity for tolerogen are preferentially eliminated, with low avidity cells being most likely to escape the tolerance induction mechanism. Thus it would be expected that the tolerogen-specific cells in tolerant mice would have a different repertoire than those in normal mice. To find evidence in favor of this prediction, neonatal B10.A mice were rendered tolerant to B10 by the injection of 15 X 10(6) (B10.A X B10)F1 spleen and bone marrow cells, and tolerance was assessed by the acceptance of B10 skin grafts for greater than 50 days. Mice rendered tolerant in this manner contain severely reduced (to less than 10% of normal) but detectable numbers of tolerogen-specific cytotoxic cell precursors that can be activated in the presence, but not absence, of exogenous interleukin 2. Spleen cells from the tolerant animals were compared with those of normal B10.A mice with respect to the expression of differentiation markers on the surface of B10-specific cytotoxic cells and their precursors, and the relative strength of the anti-B10 response toward Kb and Db as a measure of the repertoire of the cytotoxic cell populations. The T cell nature of the tolerogen-specific cytotoxic cells in both normal and tolerant mice was confirmed by their susceptibility to lysis by anti-Thy-1 or Lyt-2 antibody and complement. More importantly, cold target inhibition experiments showed that cytotoxic T cells from tolerant mice were inhibited to a greater degree by B10.A(2R) (KkDb) cold targets than B10.A(5R) (KbDd), suggesting that the response was preferentially directed at the D end of H-2, in direct contrast to normal B10.A spleen cells, which show a preferential response against Kb. Measurement of the frequency of anti-Kb and anti-Db cytotoxic T cell precursors in the spleens of normal and tolerant mice confirmed the differential specificities seen in the cold target experiments. The data suggest that neonatal tolerance induction results in repertoire modification of the anti-tolerogen response rather than a uniform decrease in anti-tolerogen reactivity. Possible mechanisms to explain the alteration in the repertoire of tolerant mice are discussed.\r"

With this regimen, graft survival is prolonged from 7.4 +/- 0.5 days in unmodified, acutely rejecting hosts to 25 +/- 12 days in enhanced recipients, with one-third of the grafts surviving indefinitely. To test for suppressor capacities, 60 X 10(6) splenic T helper/inducer (W3/25+) and T suppressor/cytotoxic (OX8+) cells were adoptively transferred 7 and 14 days after transplantation either into unmodified syngeneic LEW animals that received (LEW X BN)F1 test grafts 24 hr later or into T cell-deprived B rats with indefinitely functioning heart transplants that were reconstituted with sensitized lymph node cells (100 X 10(6). W3/25+ T cells harvested on days 7 and 14 from enhanced recipients prolonged test graft survival in unmodified hosts (13.1 +/- 2.3 and 13.3 +/- 1.3 days, respectively, p less than 0.001) and delayed rejection in reconstituted B rats from 6.7 +/- 0.5 to 18.2 +/- 6.5 and 23.3 +/- 5.8 days, respectively (p less than 0.001). OX8+ and B lymphocytes had no suppressor activity. However, enzymatic stripping of the surfaces of W3/25+ cells abrogated suppressor function. Similarly, after i.p. treatment with cyclophosphamide, W3/25+ T cells lost their suppressor properties. Lack of donor specific but not third party alloaggressiveness was demonstrated by the profoundly diminished ability of W3/25+ lymphocytes from enhanced hosts to recreate rejection in nonreconstituted B rats, even when exogenous interleukin 2 was administered. After pronase treatment, however, W3/25+ T cells were capable of inducing immunoresponsiveness at a tempo similar to naive T helper cells (31.5 +/- 12.5 vs 32.8 +/- 7.9). Thus, the present studies provide evidence for the development of a specific W3/25+ suppressor cell in the induction of active and passive enhancement. Coincident abrogation of specific T effector alloaggressiveness is apparently mediated by surface-blocking factors.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that at least two types of Lyt-1+, Lyt-2-, L3T4+ helper T cell clones can be distinguished in vitro by different patterns of lymphokine secretion and by different forms of B cell help. Evidence is presented here to show that one type of helper T cell clone (TH1) causes delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) when injected with the appropriate antigen into the footpads of naive mice. The antigen-specific, major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted footpad swelling reaction peaked at approximately 24 hr. Footpad swelling was induced by all TH1 clones tested so far, including clones specific for soluble, particulate, or allogeneic antigens. In contrast, local transfer of TH2 cells and antigen did not produce a DTH reaction, even when supplemented with syngeneic spleen accessory cells. Similarly, local transfer of an alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone into appropriate recipients did not produce DTH. The requirements for the DTH reaction induced by TH1 cells were investigated further by using TH1 clones with dual specificity for both foreign antigens and M1s antigens. Although these clones responded in vitro to either antigen + syngeneic presenting cells, or M1s disparate spleen cells, they responded in vivo only to antigen + MHC and did not cause footpad swelling in an M1s-disparate mouse in the absence of antigen. Moreover, in vitro preactivation of TH1 or TH2 cells with the lectin concanavalin A was insufficient to induce DTH reactions upon subsequent injection into footpads. From these results, we conclude that the lack of DTH given by TH2 clones in vivo could be due to the inability of the TH2 cells to produce the correct mediators of DTH, or to a lack of stimulation of TH2 clones in the footpad environment.\r"

However, in contrast to results obtained with T cell hybridomas, antigen presentation by planar membranes did not induce measurable IL 2 production, and proliferative responses were not detected. Rather, recognition of only Ek beta:Ek alpha and antigen resulted in the specific induction of a long-lived state of proliferative nonresponsiveness to subsequent stimulation by conventional APC and antigen. Induction of nonresponsiveness required protein synthesis, and was not simply due to the absence of IL 2. The antigen-nonresponsive cells could respond to either PMA plus ionomycin or IL 2, and they expressed normal levels of surface antigen-receptor molecules. These results demonstrate that recognition by normal T cell clones of antigen and Ia molecules in the absence of other accessory cell molecules and signals results in a prolonged state of proliferative nonresponsiveness, possibly similar to a state of T cell tolerance in vivo.\r"

The current study delineates the in vivo effects of HIV on distinct functional subsets of CD4 cells in homosexually active men who have been infected with HIV for different lengths of time, and examines the capacity of lymphocytes from these men to proliferate in vitro in response to soluble antigen. Although peripherial blood mononuclear cells from most acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients did not proliferate in response to either tetanus toxoid or Candida albicans, cells from most HIV seropositive men without AIDS, many of whom had been infected for more than 18 mo, responded normally to both. Non-responsiveness in HIV-infected men without AIDS was a late event and was associated with longer duration of infection, lower CD4 cell numbers, and subsequent development of AIDS. A defect in this response was observed in only one of 19 HIV seropositive men whose CD4 levels were greater than 300/mm3, but in eight of 10 with levels less than 300/mm3. The defect could not be attributed to a selective depletion of defined CD4 subpopulations that respond to soluble antigen. Dual-color immunofluorescent flow cytometry indicated that 4B4+, 2H4-, and HB-11- CD4 cells were not lost at a faster rate than other CD4 subsets.\r"

The source of the toxoplasma infection in these patients and the specific immune deficit that allows for this virulent form of the infection are unknown. By using a mouse model of toxoplasmosis, we found that selective depletion of T-4+ lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells) produces overwhelming infection and death in both acute and chronic toxoplasmosis. However, the pattern of infection is remarkably different in chronically infected mice as compared with acutely infected mice when the mice are depleted of CD4+ T cells. During acute infection loss of the CD4+ T cell population leads to severe systemic infection with only mild disease in the brain. In chronically infected mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, death follows severe CNS damage due to toxoplasma infection with only minor systemic involvement. In chronically infected mice treated with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, reactivation of the toxoplasma infection occurs despite high titers of circulating antitoxoplasma antibody. In parallel with these results in mice, CNS toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients may be due to reactivation of infection acquired much earlier in life.\r"

This near normal production of IFN contrasts with our previous observation that IL 2 production in bone marrow transplant recipients is severely impaired for at least 6 mo post-transplant.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to determine whether a monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for rat interleukin 2 receptors (IL 2R) inhibits the activation of effector T cells that adoptively transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). MAb OX 39 appears to be specific for IL 2R because it binds to concanavalin A-activated, but not resting, rat lymphocytes and inhibits mitogen- and IL 2-induced proliferation of rat spleen cells. Moreover, this MAb inhibits the in vitro activation of effector cells of EAE by myelin basic protein when added to immune donor spleen cell at the start of 72-hr culture or after 24 hr, but not when added after 48 hr of culture. Other studies employed MAb W3/25, which reacts with the rat helper T cell subset and appears to define the rat homolog of the human CD4 marker present on T4-positive cells. MAb W3/25 also blocks in vitro activation of EAE effector cells, and this blocking effect can be abrogated by adding rat T cell growth factor or partially purified IL 2 to the donor spleen cell cultures. T cell growth factor alone is incapable of activating EAE effector cells. These findings are discussed with respect to the role of lymphokines in the generation of autoreactive T cells.\r"

To further our understanding of this abnormality of B cell differentiation and maturation, we have employed two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to analyze the proteins synthesized by lymphocytes of several strains. Two proteins were produced by lymphocytes from NZB mice but not those from normal strains. One was a 16 kd protein with a pI of 5.1, and the other was a 27.5 kd protein with a pI of 4.5. The presence of the xid gene on the NZB background suppressed production of both proteins. They were synthesized by spleen cells but not by bone marrow or lymph node cells, and production was restricted to enlarged B lymphocytes. p16 was synthesized by normal mouse strain B cells upon stimulation with LPS. The 27.5 kd protein was shown to be secreted. On the basis of partial amino acid sequence determination of proteins eluted from gels, p27.5 was identified as J chain and p16 as the C terminal fragment of mu-chain. The synthesis of two other proteins, 13 kd and 18 kd in size, was elevated in NZB spleen lymphocytes. The 18 kd protein was identified as translation initiation factor eIf-4D. The increased level of this protein may be related to the upregulation of immunoglobulin synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The function of the T4 antigen, a marker for a differentiated T cell subset, is not well understood. Our previous observation that a chemoattractant human lymphokine, lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF), which selectively induces motile responses in unactivated T4+ lymphocytes, led us to investigate whether LCF could also induce T4+ cell activation. Because LCF acts selectively on T4+ cells, we next determined whether the T4 antigen has a function in this LCF-induced cellular activation. A T4+ lymphocyte migratory response is induced by divalent anti-T4 antibody, but not by corresponding Fab fragments of the same antibody. Fab fragments of anti-T4 antibody, but not Fab fragments of anti-T3 antibody, block the migratory effect of both LCF and divalent anti-T4. Furthermore, LCF but not divalent anti-T4, evokes the expression of interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptors and HLA-DR antigen on T4+ lymphocytes in 24 hr. These effects are quantitatively similar to those observed by anti-T3 antibody activation. LCF-induced IL 2 receptor expression is blocked by co-incubation with anti-T4 antibody and anti-T4 Fab fragments, whereas anti-T3 activation is not inhibitable by anti-T4 Fab fragments. Because cultured monocytes express the T4 antigen, we investigated the action of LCF on cultured monocyte migration and HLA-DR expression. Induction of monocyte migration by LCF and anti-T4 antibody increases proportionally as T4 antigen expression increases in vitro. This enhanced migration is inhibitable by anti-T4 Fab fragments. Monocyte activation, as measured by augmented HLA-DR expression 24 hr after incubation with LCF, but not anti-T4 antibody, is quantitatively similar to the effects of interferon-gamma. Augmented HLA-DR expression is blocked by anti-T4 Fab fragments but not by antibody to interferon-gamma. These studies indicate that LCF interacts with T4+ lymphocytes and monocytes to induce migration and cellular activation.\r"

This was observed regardless of the responsiveness of a given patient's cells to interleukin 2 (IL 2) and to B cell growth factor (BCGF). In contrast IFN-gamma strongly and reproducibly synergized with IL 2 (but not with BCGF) to support B-CLL proliferation in five of the 10 patients. The effect of IFN-gamma was dose related and could be inhibited by an anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal Ab. A monoclonal Ab toward the IL 2 receptor molecule was also inhibitory. Preincubation with IFN-gamma potentiated the responsiveness of B-CLL to IL 2 in secondary cultures, showing that IFN-gamma exerts its effect before that of IL 2.\r"

We investigated the effects of such T cell supernatants derived from atopic individuals (TCSN-A) on functionally distinct B cell subsets to determine at what developmental stage B cells become responsive to this IgE-enhancing activity. B cells from normal and allergic donors were separated into subsets of small resting and large activated cells by density centrifugation or unit gravity sedimentation. When stimulated by TCSN-A, large activated B cells made more IgE than small resting B cells. The difference was as much as 3300% in comparing these subsets from allergic donors. Similarly, resting B cells stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) made 52 to 125% more IgE in response to TCSN-A than unstimulated small resting B cells. However, IgE production from large B cells, already activated in vivo, was not enhanced by the addition of SAC. Notably, the IgE level synthesized by in vivo large activated B cells from allergic persons was markedly greater than that seen with similar cells from normal donors, whereas resting B cells purified from allergic and normal donors produced comparable levels of IgE in response to TCSN-A. These results suggest that this enhancing activity functions as an IgE differentiation factor for activated B cells. This was further confirmed by the effects of TCSN-A on the IgM- and IgE-secreting EBV-transformed human B cell line K1D5. TCSN-A specifically enhanced IgE synthesis from these cells; TCSN from normal donors, IL 2, IFN-gamma, and BCGF did not. These results confirm that this activity functions as an IgE-specific differentiation factor, directly influencing activated B cells to synthesize IgE.\r"

The present study represents an analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire exhibited by such cells. Clones of H-2Kb-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated under primary limiting dilution conditions by using spleen cells from nude mice. These clones were analyzed on a panel of Kb mutant target cells to assess the receptor specificity of each clone. Unlike thymic bearing mice the CTL repertoires of which are exceedingly diverse, it was found that in most cases the vast majority of clones from each individual exhibited the same reactivity pattern. The particular pattern varied from individual to individual. Clones from three animals that exhibited this phenomenon were additionally analyzed by using a monoclonal antibody that can detect the utilization of the gene products of the V beta 8 family. In one animal all clones were V beta 8 positive, whereas in the others, all clones were negative. We conclude that the T cell receptor repertoire in nude mice is extremely limited and represents in vivo expansion of a relatively small number of functional precursors.\r"

The mitogenic properties of anti-CD3 antibodies have suggested that this complex may be the transducer of the antigenic signal to the intracellular environment. In the present investigation, we studied some of the structural and functional characteristics of the CD3 complex on human thymocytes. In 11 specimens tested, we found that anti-CD3 antibodies react with 50 to 76% of the thymocytes. Two-color immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the majority (greater than 50%) of thymocytes express both CD3 and CD1 on their surfaces. The latter is a marker of immature thymocytes. However, a distinct subpopulation comprising 13 to 19% of the total cells displays only CD3, while an approximately equal percentage of cells expresses only CD1. The mitogenic potential of anti-CD3 antibodies on peripheral T cells is dependent on the presence of monocytes. Anti-CD3 antibodies by themselves cannot activate thymocytes, indicating that functionally active monocytes are absent from the thymocyte population. Even the addition of peripheral monocytes does not allow a response of thymocytes to anti-CD3 antibodies. However, when the anti-CD3 antibody 64.1 is added in the presence of exogenous rIL 2, a strong antibody and lymphokine dose-dependent response ensues. Only CD1- CD3+ thymocytes are stimulated by the addition of antibody and IL 2. The mere expression of CD3 on the CD1+ CD3+ subpopulation of thymocytes apparently is not sufficient to render the cells responsive to the signals of anti-CD3 and IL 2.\r"

  ".U": "87224036\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of early \"competence\" genes has been examined in murine peritoneal macrophages treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This set of genes (e.g., c-myc, c-fos, r-fos, JE, and KC) were first described in BALB/c 3T3 cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor. We have previously reported that LPS induces the rapid and transient expression of both c-myc and c-fos in macrophages. In the present report, we present evidence demonstrating that the mRNA for JE and KC are also induced in macrophages after treatment of LPS. The r-fos gene was not detectably induced by LPS under the experimental conditions used in this study. The induction of JE and KC were dependent upon the dose of LPS and exhibited different time courses. mRNA for both KC and JE was induced within 30 min from the initiation of treatment. Although mRNA for JE continued to accumulate for up to 24 hr, mRNA for KC was optimally seen after 60 min and had disappeared by 4 hr. c-fos, JE, and KC mRNA were all inducible by a variety of structurally diverse but functionally similar agents (e.g., heat killed Listeria monocytogenes, maleyl-bovine serum albumin, and fucoidan). Interferon-gamma, a potent but functionally distinct stimulus of macrophage activation, did not effect the expression of JE or KC mRNA. The expression of mRNA for c-fos could be readily induced by treatment of macrophages with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) alone and that for JE by PMA plus the inophore A23187; mRNA for KC was largely unaffected by these agents. These results suggest that expression of the c-fos and JE genes are regulated by products of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. The difference between c-fos or JE and KC raises the possibility that LPS may stimulate at least two independent routes of early gene expression. LPS does not promote macrophage proliferative activity alone, and in fact inhibits the proliferative response to the macrophage growth factor colony-stimulating factor 1. Taken together these findings suggest that the products of these genes may function in the acquisition of competence for highly differentiated functions in addition to that for cell division.\r"

The extraction of lipids from the serum abolished its ability to induce tissue TGase activity and to inhibit cytostatic activity, but these capabilities were fully restored by readdition of all trans-retinol or all trans-retinoic acid at physiological concentrations. Addition of dansylcadaverine, a competitive inhibitor of TGase, resulted in complete recovery of macrophages from retinoid-induced suppression of cytostatic activity. These results suggest that endogenous retinoids play an important role in the regulation of macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity in a process that is independent of prostaglandin secretion but seems to involve the protein cross-linking enzyme, tissue transglutaminase.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation that is synthesized by several human cell types including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). We examined the synthesis and release of PAF by stimulated human PMN under several conditions, assayed by the incorporation of [3H]acetate into PAF and by bioassay. PAF synthesis was induced by calcium ionophore A23187 (IoA), opsonized zymosan (OpsZ), and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) with the relative order of potency IoA much greater than OpsZ greater than FMLP. A variety of other agonists, including phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of protein kinase C and of PMN functional responses, did not stimulate PAF synthesis. PAF synthesis by PMN in response to IoA, OpsZ, and FMLP was concentration- and time-dependent but release of the phospholipid was not: little PAF (1 to 10%) was released from PMN in suspension regardless of the total amount produced, the agonist, its concentration, the time of incubation, or the concentration of extracellular albumin. This was also the case with functionally altered neutrophils that had been \"primed\" with cytochalasin B or lipopolysaccharide or that had adhered to surfaces. PAF synthesis was tightly coupled with leukotriene B4 production by adherent PMN as well as by neutrophils in suspension, supporting the hypothesis that the two lipid autacoids may be derived from a common precursor. However, PAF synthesis could be dissociated from aggregation and surface adhesion, indicating that it is not absolutely required for these responses of activated PMN. The total amount of PAF that accumulated, but not the percentage that was released, was altered in adherent PMN compared to cells in suspension. These experiments demonstrate that PAF production and its subsequent processing by human neutrophils are highly regulated events. PAF synthesis is associated with PMN activation, but it is not a requisite for early adhesive responses of neutrophils. Because little of the PAF produced by stimulated PMN is released from the cells, it appears that PAF has an intracellular role in PMN function and/or that it may have novel intercellular effects that do not require release into the fluid phase.\r"

In BMMC and PT-18 cells, even 20-hr incubation of the cells with 1 microgram/ml PT, which ADP-ribosylates more than 97% of 41 kDa, alpha-subunit of Ni in the cells, failed to affect the IgE-dependent release of histamine or arachidonate. The results indicate that GTP-binding protein, Ni, is not involved in the transduction of triggering signals induced by cross-linking of IgE receptors. In contrast, pretreatment of rat mast cells with 1 ng/ml to 0.1 microgram/ml PT for 2 hr inhibited histamine release induced by compound 48/80 in a dose-dependent manner. A similar pretreatment with PT inhibited thrombin-induced histamine release from BMMC and N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine-induced histamine release from human basophils in a similar dose-dependent fashion. However, even 20 hr of incubation of sensitized BMMC with 1 microgram/ml PT failed to inhibit either thrombin-induced or antigen-induced breakdown of phosphatidylinositides (PI), i.e., the formation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, Quin-2 signal, and the release of arachidonic acid. The results indicate that the inhibition of thrombin-induced histamine release by PT-treatment is not due to the inhibition of PI-turnover, and that Ni is not involved in thrombin-induced or antigen-induced (IgE-dependent) hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositides in mast cells.\r"

To determine the mechanism for regulation of acute-phase gene expression, we examined changes in the rates of transcription and specific hepatic mRNA content for rabbit CRP, SAA, and some complement protein mRNA during an acute-phase response. Induction of a sterile inflammatory reaction with intramuscular injection of turpentine resulted in an increase in the hepatocellular content of CRP, SAA, C3, and factor B mRNA and the transcription of CRP, SAA, and C3 genes. These data suggest that the increase in CRP, SAA, and C3 serum concentrations observed during an acute-phase reaction is due to an increase in biosynthesis and is, at least in part, under transcriptional control.\r"

SPE is an inbred strain derived from progenitors trapped near Grenada in Spain and has been classified as mus 3 or mus spretus. The sequence of the C lambda 2S gene is virtually identical to that of BALB/c both in the coding region and in flanking sequences, suggesting that it is an expressed gene in the SPE strain. By contrast, the C lambda 4S gene on the same cluster has diverged in sequence from that of BALB/c and contains a large deletion that precludes its normal expression. Whereas BALB/c J lambda 4 region contains substitutions that probably preclude its usage, the SPE J lambda 4 gene includes all sequences required for a functional J gene. Comparison of the C lambda 2S and C lambda 4S gene sequences with those available for BALB/c C lambda 3 and C lambda 1 confirms the close relationship between the C lambda 1-C lambda 4 and C lambda 2-C lambda 3 gene pairs. The C lambda 3 gene of BALB/c is more closely related to C lambda 2S than is C lambda 1 of BALB/c to C lambda 4S. If it is assumed that C lambda 1 and C lambda 2 are respective duplicates of C lambda 4 and C lambda 3 and that these duplications occurred at the same time, then the C lambda 2 gene has been under stronger selective pressure than C lambda 4.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the T cell receptor repertoire in an immune response in which the Ia and nominal antigenic determinants are defined and limited, we have cloned and sequenced the expressed receptors from four independent, beef insulin-specific T cell lines from C57BL mice. Each of these lines responded to beef but not to the pork insulin, thus defining the nominal antigenic determinant recognized. Furthermore, each of these lines could only be presented antigen by B6 but not mutant B6.C-H-2bm12 antigen-presenting cells, thus defining the requisite Ia recognition or antigen-association site. In spite of this functional similarity in ligand specificity, each of these T cell lines was found to use different V alpha and V beta gene segments. Moreover, structural comparisons of implied protein sequences of each of these receptors showed no stretches of conserved amino acid residues that could be implicated in ligand interaction. However, the V alpha genes used by these four clones appeared considerably more homologous to each other than were their V beta genes.\r"

  ".W": "A limiting dilution analysis (LDA) was used to assess the functional profiles of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) recovered from 15 human solid tumors. The microculture system applied in this study has been shown to allow virtually all normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBL-T) to undergo clonal proliferation and was applied to obtain estimates of the frequency of both proliferating and cytolytic cells among the TIL population. A total of 624 microcultures proliferating in the presence of irradiated allogeneic spleen cells and interleukin 2 (IL 2) were expanded for clonal analysis. These TIL microcultures were assessed for surface antigen phenotype, IL 2 production (helper function) and for their cytolytic capabilities against the human erythroleukemic line K562 (natural killer (NK)-like activity) and P815, a mouse mastocytoma line, in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), i.e., lectin-dependent cell cytotoxicity (LDCC) which allows the detection of cytolytic activity irrespective of the antigenic specificity of the effector cells. Whenever feasible, cytolytic activity against autologous and allogeneic tumor cells was tested. LDA first demonstrated that the proliferative potential was decreased in T lymphocytes infiltrating human solid tumors (approximately 1 in 50 to 1 in 2 proliferating T lymphocyte precursors (PTL-P) in this series) as compared to normal PBL-T (1 in 2 to 1 in 1 PTL-P). The growth pattern in the titration cultures showed a remarkable agreement with the single-hit Poisson model implying that third party cells are unlikely to be involved in the reduced proliferative potential. Quantitative estimates of functional precursors showed that, in spite of reduced proliferative potential, cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-P) against unknown antigens (LDCC-reactive) accounted for a considerable part of the microcultures in many cases. The precursor frequency of T lymphocytes with NK-like activity was usually low in situ (with the exception of glioma), whereas it was in the normal range in the patient's autologous PBL-T. In four evaluable cases, quantitative assessment showed that 1 in 200 to 1 in 1000 T lymphocytes from TIL was cytolytic against allogeneic tumor cells, which is in the range of alloreactive cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated in the mixed lymphocyte culture from normal PBL. Cytolytic activity against autologous target cells could not be quantitatively estimated but out of 88 clones from 4 patients, 3 clones originating from 2 glioma patients showed high lytic values against autologous tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The HITc clone utilized (denoted 1.B6) was specifically cytolytic to FBL-3, a syngeneic Friend virus-induced murine leukemia. Activation in vitro (48 hr) with FBL-3 induced secretion of interleukin 2 (IL 2), expression of IL 2 receptors (IL 2R), and in vitro proliferation. These cells could be \"rested\" for several weeks without stimulation, which resulted in reduced expression of IL 2R; however, restimulation with antigen resulted in reinduction of IL 2R and proliferation. The ability of cloned HITc to proliferate and to survive in vivo was examined in cyclophosphamide (CY) pretreated donor mice congenic for the Thy-1 gene. Adoptively transferred cloned HITc could be found in large numbers, and were widely distributed in vivo 1 wk after transfer. In tumor therapy, 1.B6 cells when injected into a site of tumor (i.p.) and used as an adjunct to CY were effective against disseminated FBL-3. In this circumstance, cloned 1.B6 cells could be recovered from cured mice 125 days after transfer and were shown to specifically lyse tumor and proliferate in vitro in response to FBL-3. Thus as an adjunct to CY, tumor-specific cloned HITc are capable of eradicating disseminated leukemia, persisting long-term in vivo, and providing specific immunologic memory.\r"

LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma cells were mixed with human PBL coated either with anti-T3 (Fab) cross-linked to 315F6 (Fab) (an antitumor monoclonal antibody) or with no antibody, and were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth was totally inhibited at effector to target (E:T) ratios of 7.0:1 and 2.1:1, and was partially inhibited at 0.7:1 with antibody-coated PBL, but was not inhibited by uncoated PBL. T cell-mediated protection against tumor growth occurred when an antitumor was physically cross-linked to anti-T3. Neither a mixture of unlinked anti-T3 and antitumor antibodies nor anti-human MHC class I cross-linked to antitumor antibody prevented tumor growth. Whereas in vitro cytotoxicity was mediated exclusively by T8+ cells and was augmented by brief exposure of effector cells to IL 2, tumor neutralization in vivo was mediated by both T4+ and T8+ cells and was not significantly stimulated by prior exposure of the cells to IL 2. We conclude that human T cells, when targeted with appropriate antibody heteroaggregates, can specifically inhibit tumor growth at low E:T ratios, and that cells mediating tumor neutralization in vivo may differ from those mediating cytotoxicity in vitro.\r"

By contrast, almost complete tumor inhibition is observed when these injections are performed in mice challenged with tumor cells admixed at 1:5 cell ration with nylon wool column purified lymphocytes obtained from tumor-bearing animals. The host immune system plays a fundamental role in this lymphokine-activated tumor inhibition (LATI), which is derived from the local combination of IL 2 and nonreactive lymphocytes. When the host is sublethally irradiated, or the reactivity of L3T4 and Asialo GM1 lymphocytes is suppressed by in vivo antibody treatment, in fact, LATI no longer takes place. Daily injections of antibody to murine interferon-gamma or cyclosporin A have the same effect, indicating that lymphokine release plays an important role in the recruitment of host reactivity. The morphological data show that when LATI is taking place the tumor challenge area becomes infiltrated by mononuclear cells and granulocytes (mostly eosinophils), which establish close contacts with each other and with tumor cells as determined at ultrastructural analysis. Tumor draining lymph nodes display marked expansion of cortical and paracortical areas. Lymphocyte proliferation, interferon-gamma release and cytotoxicity against CE-2 and YAC-1 target cells are greatly enhanced during LATI. Contralateral lymph nodes and the spleen also show a slight increment of these functions. In mice challenged with CE-2 tumor cells only and receiving daily IL 2 injections, these reaction functions (with the exception of interferon-gamma secretion) are also enhanced, though to a lesser extent than during LATI and only in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Last, the growth of a second contralateral tumor challenge is significantly impaired during or after LATI, showing that a persistent and effective systemic reactivity can be quickly induced in this way.\r"

  ".U": "87224059\r", 
  ".W": "A human leukemia cell line (TALL-101) was established from the bone marrow of a patient with an undifferentiated acute T cell leukemia using the conditioned medium (CM) of the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) II-transformed human cell line J-LB1. Immunofluorescence analysis on the original leukemic cells indicated the presence of T cell markers (Leu-1, Tdt, and T11); however, the established TALL-101 cell line expressed only antigens commonly present on progenitor cells, thymocytes, and myelomonocytic cells, but not on mature T cells. A high percentage of TALL-101 cells displayed the Tac antigen which was down-regulated upon incubation in the presence of recombinant human (rH) interleukin 2 (IL 2). Interferon (IFN)-gamma induced the appearance of class II histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA) and of a T cell marker (3A1), and enhanced the expression of transferrin receptors on these cells. Further evidence for a T cell lineage of the TALL-101 cell line was provided by both chromosomic and genotypic analysis showing a translocation in chromosome 14 typical of T cell leukemias, and a rearrangement of the T-beta receptor locus. The growth-promoting activity in the J-LB1-CM was identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF), a growth factor which stimulates proliferation of normal myelomonocytic cells and other progenitor cells, but not known to have an effect on T cells. Dose response curves of [3H]thymidine incorporation and growth indicated that TALL-101 cells were sensitive to very low concentrations of rHGM-CSF, 5 ng/ml inducing maximal proliferation in chemically defined medium. The TALL-101 cell line is strictly GM-CSF-dependent for growth: upon depletion of GM-CSF from the culture medium, the cells stop proliferating immediately and die within 1 to 2 wk. The overall data, showing that GM-CSF is able to support the growth of a highly undifferentiated T cell leukemia, strongly suggests that this factor might have similar growth promoting effects on other immature T cell leukemias, and possibly, on normal T cell progenitors.\r"

Depletion of I-A bearing cells from the HD-EC population before hapten coupling prevents these cells from inducing Ts cell formation, whereas depletion of Thy-1-bearing cells from the HD-EC cell preparation has no effect. When HD-EC are adhered to glass for 2 hr, the ability to induce Ts cell formation resides in the adherent population. Exposure of HD-EC to a dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that largely abrogates the ability of hapten-coupled EC to immunize mice for a DTH response does not affect the ability of these cells to activate Ts cells. Treatment of mice with i.p. administration of 20 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide 2 days before EC harvesting abrogates the ability of HD-EC from these mice to induce Ts cell formation. HD-EC from B10.A(3R) (I-Jb) but not B10.A(5R) (I-Jk) mice induce Ts cell formation in B10.A(3R) mice, demonstrating that the ability to do so is restricted by the I-J locus. Transmission electron microscopy of adherent HD-EC populations demonstrated that two cell types were present. One type had the characteristics of keratinocytes; the other was monocyte-like and resembled Langerhans cells or indeterminate cells in many aspects. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed this second cell type to bear I-A/I-E antigen. These cells were T-200 positive and Mac-1 negative by immunoperoxidase staining. Extensive examination by light and electron microscopy failed to reveal any dermal components in the EC populations; however, a very small degree of dermal contamination cannot be excluded. Thus, EC that activate afferent-acting Ts cells are high-density, I-A+, Thy-1-, I-J restricted, glass adherent, and functionally UVR resistant and cyclophosphamide sensitive.\r"

  ".W": "Maleylated bovine serum albumin (maleyl-BSA) and other polyanionic polymers that are recognized by cell surface receptors on macrophages have been shown to induce chemotaxis, protease secretion, and tumoricidal function in this cell type. In this paper the effect of maleyl-BSA on Ia antigen expression has been evaluated. In a fashion similar to LPS, maleyl-BSA suppressed IFN-gamma-induced expression of Ia in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Also like LPS, maleyl-BSA stimulated the production and secretion of substantial amounts of PGE2 over a 24-hr period. This did not, however, appear to be the primary mechanism by which expression of Ia was suppressed, because co-treatment of the cells with indomethacin, which totally inhibited the production of PGE2, only minimally affected the suppressive activity. Surprisingly, the suppressive activity of both maleyl-BSA and LPS could be largely abrogated by co-treatment of the cells with cyclohexamide during the time period when Ia expression was sensitive to suppression. This effect was selective in that PGE2- or dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced suppression of Ia expression was not affected by cyclohexamide treatment. The data support the concept that there are multiple molecular mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of IFN-gamma-induced Ia expression in macrophages. Such mechanisms may include, in addition to the synthesis of PGE2 and consequent elevation in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, one or more proteins made early after treatment with either maleyl-BSA or LPS. Thus the function of some of these early gene products may be to regulate expression of functional genes such as that encoding Ia antigen.\r"

  ".U": "87224063\r", 
  ".W": "Natural suppressor (NS) cell activity is the ability of apparently unprimed \"null\" cells to nonspecifically suppress immune responses. Previously we have shown that NS cell activity from the spleens of mice undergoing chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is enhanced in vitro by activated T cell signals (e.g., Con A supernatant [CAS]). Here we asked if the naturally occurring suppressor activity found in the neonatal mouse spleen is caused by NS cells, and if so whether this NS activity is also responsive to T cell signals. Finally, we wanted to identify the material in the CAS to which the NS cells respond. Spleen cells from (BALB/c X B10.D2)F1 neonates contain potent, genetically unrestricted suppressor activity toward normal mitogen responses. The cells responsible for this suppression are nonadherent, Thy-, Ig- and are thus by definition NS cells. Neonatal spleen NS cells suppress the indicator Con A response of all mouse strains tested, but their behavior with regard to LPS responses is different. They significantly inhibit the indicator LPS response of allogeneic strains, but are less inhibitory of LPS-stimulated syngeneic (BALB/c X B10.D2)F1 and parental strains. However, the addition of CAS to these latter cultures enhances the NS inhibition of the LPS response to the level of suppression seen with a Con A response. Two lymphokines were able to replace the CAS. Recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) closely mimics the activity found with whole CAS, with low concentrations (1 U/well) being capable of enhancing the neonatal NS activity to near-maximal levels. Recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2) is also capable of stimulating the neonatal NS activity to near maximum. However, the rIL 2 must be added at much higher concentrations, taking greater than 50 U/well to get maximum activation of NS suppression. The addition of anti-IFN-gamma antiserum to these LPS suppression assays removes the ability of CAS to activate the neonatal NS cells. Anti-IFN-gamma antiserum also removes the ability of rIL 2 as well as rIFN-gamma to activate the NS cells. It thus appears that the rIL 2 is working by its ability to stimulate IFN-gamma production. Anti-IFN-gamma also removes the ability of the neonatal NS cells to suppress a Con A response. Therefore, it appears that neonatal splenic NS cells respond to, and are activated by, IFN-gamma to carry out their suppressive activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87224064\r", 
  ".W": "Considerable disagreement exists among immunologists regarding the polymorphic nature of the murine Mls system. An estimate of the capacity of a given putative Mls allelic gene product expressed on a stimulator population to elicit proliferation of H-2-compatible Mls-disparate unprimed T cells may vary widely among different groups of investigators. This laboratory has shown previously that preactivation of B lymphocytes in a splenocyte stimulator population by exposure to goat anti-mouse IgD (GaMD) before irradiation dramatically enhanced the in vitro presentation not only of the strongly stimulatory (and highly cross-reactive) Mlsa and Mlsd, but also the more poorly stimulatory Mlsc specificity. Therefore, by the use of GaMD-treated splenocytes that optimally present the various Mls non-H-2 stimulatory epitopes, we attempted in this study to obtain a clearer understanding of Mls polymorphism by re-examining the conflicting claims associated with the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) stimulatory capacity of different Mls specificities. Among H-2k responder cells of the Mls null, Mlsa, Mlsb, or Mlsd genotypes, only T cells from Mlsd-bearing CBA/J mice did not respond to Mlsc determinants present on GaMD-treated C3H/HeJ stimulator cells. Crossing CBA/J with an Mlsc-responsive mouse strain yielded an F1 animal in which nonresponsiveness to Mlsc was dominant. Although Mlsa (AKR/J) and Mlsc (C3H/HeJ) parental T cells both proliferated vigorously to Mlsd (CBA/J) stimulator cells, the Mlsa/c (AKR X C3H)F1 T cells responded poorly to GaMD-treated Mlsd stimulator cells. In addition, Mlsd (CBA/J) T cells were nonresponsive to Mlsa (AKR/J), Mlsc (C3H/HeJ), and Mlsa/c (AKR X C3H)F1 GaMD-treated stimulator cells. Because Mlsa (AKR/J) and Mlsc (C3H/HeJ) specificities are mutually stimulatory, at least limited polymorphism must exist in the Mls system. However, because Mlsa/c (AKR X C3H) and Mlsd (CBA/J) specificities are mutually nonstimulatory, T cell proliferation in an Mlsd-defined primary MLR is most likely due to a composite response to Mlsa and Mlsc epitopes present on CBA/J stimulator cells.\r"

  ".U": "87224068\r", 
  ".W": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), also called cyclin, is an intranuclear polypeptide whose synthesis reaches its maximum during the S-phase of the cell cycle. PCNA is expressed in several kinds of proliferating cells, one of which is the mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocyte. PCNA expression increases from the late G1 phase through the S-phase of the cell cycle. This study is focused on the regulation of PCNA expression during the G1 phase of human T lymphocytes and on the relationship between PCNA expression and the rate of T cell proliferation. Special use is made of human autoantibodies to PCNA and the development of flow cytometry to label this intranuclear polypeptide. Unstimulated purified human peripheral blood T cells were PCNA negative. T cells treated with monoclonal antibody (64.1) to the CD3 complex expressed receptors for IL 2 but did not express PCNA until exogenous IL 2 was added to the culture. PCNA expression as well as the entry of the cells into S-phase could be inhibited by IL 2 receptor antibodies. Transferrin receptors were expressed only in T cells that were stimulated with both 64.1 and exogenous IL 2. Transferrin receptors were detectable before the cells expressed PCNA. Thus, the onset of PCNA expression is a phase in cell proliferation that follows transferrin receptor expression but preceded DNA synthesis. Drugs like dexamethasone and cyclosporin, which affect the early part of G1, inhibited PCNA expression; whereas cytarabine (ara-C) and hydroxyurea, which affect the S-phase and prevent DNA synthesis, did not block PCNA expression. There was a close correlation between the number of PCNA-positive cells and the number of S-phase cells in unperturbed T cell cultures. The highest level of PCNA expression was seen in cells that were in the first cycle after stimulation. The results show that PCNA expression is regulated by a signal after IL 2 binding and that PCNA labeling is a precise indicator for human T cells that are committed to DNA synthesis. Comparing these results with previous observations on the expression of some other activation-associated antigens, we suggest that the onset of PCNA expression represents a discrete step in T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The reactivity of Lyt-2+ or L3T4+ T cells stimulated with either mutant class I or class II MHC alloantigens was studied. Whereas stimulation with class I MHC antigens induced only Lyt-2+ T cells to proliferate and to secrete IL 2, stimulation with class II MHC alloantigens induced L3T4+ but not Lyt-2+ T cells. When the frequencies of precursors of IL 2-secreting T lymphocytes (IL 2TL-p) were determined by limiting dilution analyses, class I MHC-reactive Lyt-2+ T cells displayed frequencies (f = 1/200) as high in magnitude as those within class II MHC-reactive L3T4+ (f = 1/100). Clonally developing IL 2TL of either T cell subset were antigen-specific, as shown in split-culture experiments. Whereas L3T4+ helper TL could be induced to specific IL 2 secretion over a long time period (days 3 to 9), Lyt-2+ TL showed a marked time optimal on day 4; thereafter, the number of TL colonies inducible to secrete IL 2 decreased steadily. IL 2 production and IL 2TL-p frequencies of unseparated T responder cells were not the numerical superposition of the two individual T cell subsets (Lyt-2+ + L3T4+); the latter finding is likely to reflect regulatory influences of Lyt-2+ T cells on IL 2-secreting L3T4+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "We developed antibody conjugates by covalently coupling antibodies against mouse mu-chain and monoclonal antibodies against nominal antigen, myoglobin, as a tool for antigen presentation and as a model of specific presentation of antigen by antigen-specific B cells and T-B interaction. In the presence of the antibody conjugates, myoglobin-specific Iad-restricted cloned T cells proliferated at 1000-fold lower concentration of myoglobin than the stimulatory concentration without the conjugates. This enhanced presentation was observed only when Iad spleen cells were 1000 R-irradiated but not 3300 R-irradiated, consistent with B cell presentation. The simple mixture of each component of the conjugates had no enhancement effects. The conjugates per se had no mitogenic effects on either splenic B cells or the cloned T cells at concentrations employed for antigen presentation. The conjugates reduced the number of antigen-presenting cells required for the maximal response but did not change the kinetics of response. The enhanced presentation by the conjugates required a genetically restricted interaction with B cells. Antigen specificity of the enhanced presentation was confirmed by using various T cell clones or lines with different antigen specificities and different conjugates constructed with monoclonal antibodies of known epitope specificity. The enhanced presentation was significantly inhibited by competition with exogenous mouse IgM or anti-mouse mu-chain but was not significantly inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against Fc receptor. Thus, conjugate-coated B cells serve as models for myoglobin-specific B cells in that they can take up specific antigens at extremely low concentration and can present the antigen to specific T cells. This model system can be applied to any antigen and any species without the need to develop antigen-specific B cell clones, which is not yet possible for most antigens and species of experimental animals. This system allowed us to investigate the relationship between T cell epitope and B cell epitope when these cells interact with each other in an antigen-specific and Ia-restricted manner. Experiments using antibody conjugates of different monoclonal antibodies against myoglobin and various myoglobin-specific cloned T cells of known antigen specificity revealed that there are some particular combinations in which much more limited enhancement of antigen presentation is observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Footpad swelling developing in mice after local injection of LPS (S. marcescens) was found to consist of two phases with peaks occurring on days 2 to 3 and 6 to 8, respectively. Histopathologically, the reaction was characterized by edema and mononuclear cell infiltration; the second peak was associated with intravascular thrombosis as is typically described for the Shwartzman reaction to LPS. Recombinant DNA-derived IFN-gamma, administered by i.p. injection, had a suppressive effect on the development of the reaction. The same effect was seen with recombinant DNA-derived IFN-alpha 1 and with the natural mixture of IFN-alpha and -beta. In mice pretreated with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IFN-gamma, the footpad response to LPS was modified in that a delayed monophasic rather than a biphasic response occurred. These data indicate that LPS induces local production of IFN-gamma, which acts as a trigger or positive regulator of the reaction. The effect of a single pretreatment with neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibody was found to last for as long as 6 wk. Experiments in which antibody administration was delayed till after LPS challenge indicated that endogenous IFN-gamma was also involved in the late phases of the inflammation. The results show that regulation of inflammation by interferons is complex in that local IFN-gamma acts as a positive factor, whereas systemic IFN-alpha 1 and -gamma, probably through indirect mechanisms, downregulate inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF alpha) on human natural killer (NK) function was examined. Lysis of both the NK-sensitive K562 erythroleukemia line and the relatively insensitive renal carcinoma line Cur by nonadherent peripheral blood lymphocytes was significantly enhanced as a result of an 18-hr preincubation with either rTNF alpha or recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2). When cells were preincubated with rTNF alpha and low doses of rIL 2 (1 to 10 U/ml), marked additional augmentation of lysis of both targets was noted which was greater than that caused by either cytokine alone. Similar results were observed when responses of CD16+ large granular lymphocytes selected with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter after staining with the NK-specific monoclonal antibody Leu-11 were examined, indicating that the action of the cytokines was directly on the cytotoxic cells. Augmentation of tumor cell lysis could not be ascribed to a cytolytic activity of rTNF alpha on the targets, because no combination of rIL 2, rTNF alpha, or interferon-gamma caused lysis of K562 or Cur. By flow cytometric analysis, it was found that expression of IL 2 receptors was induced on purified CD16+ large granular lymphocytes by rTNF alpha alone and to an even greater degree by the combination of rTNF alpha and rIL 2. Additional analysis of the expression of surface antigens and blocking studies with monoclonal antibodies showed that enhanced tumor cell lysis was not caused by the augmentation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1-mediated effector/target interactions. These data indicate that rTNF alpha alone, or in combination with rIL 2, directly augments NK cytotoxic activity.\r"

  ".U": "87224081\r", 
  ".W": "Because mice susceptible to interstitial nephritis use different effector T cells than nonsusceptible mice, we analyzed the differentiation process of the effector T cell repertoire by using an in vitro culture technique. In the presence of helper T lymphocytes, accessory cells, IL 2, tubular antigen, and precursor effector cells, both Lyt-2+ nephritogenic effector cells and L3T4+ nonnephritogenic effector cells can be initially induced in both susceptible and nonsusceptible strains within 3 days of culture. In nonsusceptible mice, however, the Lyt-2+ nephritogenic cell is inhibited from further development and disappears, whereas in susceptible mice, its presence is preserved with a resulting effect of tissue destruction. This selection of effector T cell preference is regulated by I-J+ T lymphocytes which are co-functionally expressed with effector cell expansion. Unlike precursor effector lymphocytes, however, the maturation of the regulatory process requires a subset of I-J+ accessory cells and structurally intact tubular antigen. Our findings indicate, therefore, that both susceptible and nonsusceptible mice have the potential for the expression of interstitial nephritis, but nonsusceptible mice are formally protected from autoimmunity by the regulation of lymphocyte preference.\r"

A similar dose-response relationship was observed when we examined the binding of polymeric IgA to HT-29 cells treated with IFN-gamma, thus reflecting expression of functional SC. Because IFN-gamma is produced by T cells during immune responses, activated T cells may be able to promote the external transport of dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM and thereby enhance the efferent limb of the secretory immune system. This is, therefore, the first observation indicating how the secretory transport capacity may be adjusted to increased local immunoglobulin production.\r"

  ".U": "87224098\r", 
  ".W": "As an important intracellular second-messenger, the concentration of calcium in the cytosol [Ca+2]i influences diverse cellular activities. To investigate the calcium requirement for distinct phases of B cell activation, we studied the effect of altering the quantity of extracellular calcium on the induction of increased B cell MHC class II molecule (Ia) expression and DNA synthesis by different B cell mitogens. During short-term cultures (less than 24 hr), the induction of class II molecules by anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig) and calcium ionophore were dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, whereas activation induced by B cell stimulation factor-1 (BSF-1) was minimally dependent on extracellular calcium, and that induced by LPS was independent of it. During longer-term cultures (i.e., greater than 24 hr), the heightened class II molecule expression that was induced by all of the B cell mitogens used was significantly compromised by depletion of extracellular free calcium. Although the anti-Ig-stimulated increase in expression of Ia could be restored by the addition of calcium to the medium at 12 hr, it could not be restored when the addition of calcium was delayed to 24 hr after the onset of culture. This was in marked contrast to the finding that BSF-1-stimulated B cell responses which were suppressed after 24 hr of culture in the presence of EGTA could be restored by the addition of calcium. Activation of B cells along the pathway leading to DNA synthesis demonstrated a requirement for extracellular calcium which was greater than that required for induction of MHC class II molecule expression. Thus, LPS-stimulated size increases of B cells after 12 hr of culture was dependent on extracellular calcium while its induction of MHC class II molecule expression was independent of extracellular calcium at this early time point. These observations indicate that the extracellular calcium requirement for B cell activation is dependent both on the activation pathway utilized by the mitogenic signal and on the duration of cell activation. Furthermore, they demonstrate that B cell stimuli that can initiate B cell activation in the relative absence of extracellular calcium may require extracellular calcium for maintenance of this activational state.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse resident peritoneal macrophages (M phi) produce the highly bioactive eicosanoid LTC4 when stimulated in vitro with zymosan or with the calcium ionophore A23187. This production was dramatically inhibited in M phi pre-exposed to IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma. Although all IFN were able to decrease the availability in M phi of the LTC4 precursor AA, this decrease was not the only cause of the IFN-induced inhibition of LTC4. In fact, further analysis of the different steps of the LTC4 biosynthetic pathway revealed that IFN-gamma could inhibit the formation of LTA4, thus of its derivatives LTC4 and LTB4, possibly acting at the level of the enzyme LTA4-synthetase. In contrast, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta only depressed the ability of M phi to metabolize AA into LTC4, leaving unaltered the synthesis of LTB4. However, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta did not influence directly the activity of any of the enzymes involved in LTC4 biosynthesis, indicating that they may act through some indirect, as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism. These data suggest that IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and, in different situations, IFN-gamma can be potentially useful in vivo in antagonizing localized anaphylactic or inflammatory reactions.\r"
