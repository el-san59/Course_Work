Neuropathological examination of the areas containing degenerated white matter indicated that the lesions affected the transcallosal fibres that link the cortex of the occipital lobes and the superior parietal lobules (SPL). The white matter situated in the temporal lobes was intact. This suggests that in man, and contrary to what has been described in the monkey, the callosal pathway followed by the temporal fibres is rostral to the one followed by the parietal or at least by the SPL fibres. The most prominent disconnection syndrome elements were left tactile anomia (in spite of a rather good tactile-motor integration between the hemispheres), left visual anomia, agraphia of the left hand and 'diagnostic' apraxia. The fact that the anterior part of the corpus callosum was intact accounts for the preservation of interhemispheric transfer of somatic sensory information and for the absence of left extinction during the dichotic listening test. An attempt is made to give a more detailed explanation of the results obtained during the different tests.\r"

  ".W": "This paper is the first of two papers describing our five-year experience with the technique of electrical stimulation of the human motor cortex. In this first paper we illustrate the basic distribution and behaviour of electromyographic responses in limb muscles to anodal stimulation of the motor cortex in intact, awake human subjects. These responses may be recorded at short latency, with estimates of conduction velocities from the brain to the spinal cord suggesting transmission in rapidly conducting pathways, such as the corticomotoneuronal component of the corticospinal tract. The site at which the stimulus activates these motor pathways to produce responses at such short latency is likely to be at, or adjacent to the origin of these major descending motor pathways in the cerebral cortex. The best stimulating sites for activation of arm or leg muscles corresponds to the known somatotopic arrangement of the cerebral cortex. The electromyographic response characteristics are different in the contracting, as compared with the relaxed muscle; the EMG response latency shortens, its size becomes larger and its threshold is lowered when the muscle is voluntarily made to contract. The mechanisms that are responsible for these characteristics are examined in the following paper.\r"

  ".W": "Using an isometric strain gauge, we measured the twitch force produced in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle by a single anodal shock to the contralateral scalp. At high intensities of stimulation this twitch can greatly exceed the force produced by supramaximal stimulation of peripheral nerve. This indicates that a single cortical shock can cause repetitive firing of some or all FDI motoneurons. Such repetitive firing was demonstrated using a collision technique in which a supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulus was given at the wrist shortly after a cortical shock. The antidromic volley from the peripheral nerve stimulation failed to obliterate completely the response to cortical stimulation. Additional EMG activity was visible in the normally silent period between ulnar M and F waves. This activity must have been due to the presence of repetitive volleys of activity set up in spinal motoneurons by the cortical shock. Such activity summates with the twitch produced by the ulnar M wave to produce a very large force twitch of the muscle. Multiple firing of some motoneurons can be observed in some individuals at cortical stimulation intensities below that necessary to evoke activity in all the motoneurons in the FDI pool. Multiple firing probably was caused by repetitive excitatory inputs impinging on spinal motoneurons. These could be demonstrated using poststimulus time histogram techniques on single motor units. Low intensities of cortical stimulation produced a single short duration (mean 1.8 ms) peak of increased motor unit firing 20 to 30 ms after the shock. At high intensities, this was followed by extra peaks some 4 to 5 ms later. H reflex testing showed that the threshold of the initial descending volley, produced by the cortical stimulus was uninfluenced by a voluntary contraction. These results are discussed with reference to the D and I waves recorded from pyramidal tract after anodal stimulation of the exposed cortex in animals.\r"

Motor conduction velocity showed a moderate degree of slowing in 5 of 6 cases studied and marked slowing in 1. Amyloid deposits were seen in nerve biopsy material of all 8 subjects and in rectal mucosa from 1. Immunohistochemical identification revealed AF (transthyretin-derived)--amyloid in all 8 instances, confirming the presence of type 1 familial amyloid neuropathy. The genealogical data supported this analysis. Six of the 8 cases originated in a small area of the north-west coast of County Donegal in Ireland.

A no-aiming condition was also studied. Reaction time was fractionated using surface EMG recording into premotor (central) and motor (peripheral) components. Premotor RT was found to be greater for parkinsonian patients than normal age-matched controls in the simple RT condition, but not in the choice condition. This effect did not depend on the parameters of the impending movement. Thus, paradoxically, parkinsonian patients were not inherently slower at initiating aiming movements from the starting position, but seemed unable to use advance information concerning motor task demands to speed up movement initiation. For both groups, low velocity movements took longer to initiate than high velocity ones. In the no-aiming condition parkinsonian RTs were markedly shorter than when aiming, but were still significantly longer than control RTs. Motor RT was constant across all conditions and was not different for patient and control subjects. In all conditions, parkinsonian movements were around 37% slower than control movements, and their movement times were more variable, the differences showing up early on in the movement, that is, during the initial ballistic phase. The within-subject variability of movement endpoints was also greater in patients. The motor dysfunction displayed in Parkinson's disease involves a number of components: (1) a basic central problem with simply initiating movements, even when minimal programming is required (no-aiming condition); (2) difficulty in maintaining computed forces for motor programs over time (simple RT condition); (3) a basic slowness of movement (bradykinesia) in all conditions; and (4) increased variability of movement in both time and space, presumably caused by inherent variability in force production.\r"

Using matching to sample techniques it was possible to demonstrate selective impairments and selective preservations not only of broad categories of semantic knowledge but also of particular subsets of such categories. Specifically, Y.O.T.'s comprehension of 'objects' was, in general, significantly more impaired than for foods or living things. Within the broad class of objects she was significantly more impaired in the comprehension of small manipulable objects than large man-made objects. Within her proper noun vocabulary there was a significant dissociation between her good comprehension of proper nouns having a unique and well-known referent (e.g., Churchill) and common proper nouns without such a referent (e.g., Jones). Her error responses were not consistent, semantic similarity and significant rate effects were observed, and it was therefore considered that her category specific comprehension deficits were primarily ones of access to a full semantic representation. We attempt to give a principled account of the increasing number of seemingly arbitrary instances of fine-grain categorical impairments of semantic knowledge. We have suggested that different weighting values from multiple sensory channels will be important in the acquisition of different categories of knowledge and that such differential weightings could be the basis of the categorical organization of systems in the brain subserving semantic knowledge.\r"

No significant differences in the AChE activity of lumbar CSF from histologically and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and normal age-matched controls were found, although they could be distinguished from controls and other dements by their lower lumbar CSF levels of nsChE activity and by their elevated ratio of AChE/nsChE. A lower level of AChE activity was observed in the lumbar CSF of patients with dementia of non-Alzheimer aetiology. The AChE and nsChE activities of ventricular CSF obtained at postmortem have also been examined. The AChE activity of the ventricular CSF of patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease was 66% lower than that of age-matched controls; these patients could also be distinguished from normals by their lower levels of nsChE and by the elevated ratio of AChE/nsChE activities. A molecular defect in the AChE in the ventricular CSF of Alzheimer patients is indicated by the finding that the enzyme failed to show inhibition by high concentrations of substrate. The lower level of AChE in ventricular CSF may reflect the changes in this enzyme in forebrain regions of Alzheimer patients. Although it is at present not possible to correlate the lower levels of nsChE found in CSF with any known brain pathology, the significantly altered ratio of AChE/nsChE activities in lumbar CSF may possibly form the basis for a diagnostic test of Alzheimer type dementia.\r"

Recently, direct pathways from the dorsolateral pons to the ON, probably involved in supraspinal micturition control, have been reported (Holstege et al., 1986). Since the pelvic floor muscles are involved not only in micturition but also in various other functions (e.g., coughing, vomiting, defaecation, parturition), an attempt has been made to establish whether, in the cat, there exist other direct brainstem pathways to the ON motoneurons. Our results indicate that specific projections to the ON are derived from 3 different areas: (1) the ipsilateral paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus; (2) the ipsilateral caudal pontine lateral reticular formation; and (3) the contralateral caudal nucleus retroambiguus. More diffuse projections (to all motoneuronal cell groups in the spinal cord including the ON) are derived from (1) neurons in the area of the nucleus subcoeruleus in the dorsolateral pontine reticular formation, (2) the nucleus raphe pallidus, and (3) the ventral part of the medullary medial reticular formation. Possible functional implications of these pathways are discussed.\r"

Some of these regions coincided with known speech centres in the left hemisphere. Others, especially on the right, did not. It is concluded that vocal activation during both speech and humming requires a collaboration of the two hemispheres in various functional patterns.\r"

For SEPs evoked by median nerve stimulation, not only the P25 and N34 components in central and parietal regions but also N25 in the frontal region were markedly enlarged in each patient. Their scalp distributions were not significantly different from those of normal subjects. P25 and N25, but not N34, were considerably attenuated by interfering tactile stimulation applied to the hand. The components corresponding to P25, N25 and N34 following electrical stimulation of the digital nerves as well as mechanical stimulation of the finger were also remarkably large and showed scalp distributions similar to those for median nerve SEPs. It is therefore concluded that the giant cortical SEPs of cortical reflex myoclonus are generated in those areas of the primary sensory cortex which generate normal SEPs, in response to an input, at least in part, from cutaneous afferents on the basis of an extremely enhanced cortical excitability.\r"

Research on commissurotomized patients, for the most part, has focused on the disconnection and has treated the hemispheres as two independent entities. A different perspective was adopted in the present study, which considered the 'split brain' as a single organism, and the two disconnected hemispheres as integral components of this organism connected to one another through subcortical structures. Eight independent tasks were conducted on 2 commissurotomized patients who were presented tachistoscopically with simultaneous bilateral information such that neither hemisphere received sufficient information to make a final decision. Only by combining the initially segregated information could a correct response be produced. Both patients performed significantly above chance in 7 of the tasks (spatial orientation, calculation, lexical decision), suggesting that the information divided between the hemispheres could be united, related, and acted upon in a unified manner. This performance was achieved in spite of each hemisphere being unaware of the information received by the other, as typically observed in 'split-brain' patients. The results indicate the coexistence of perceptual disunity and behavioural unity, and they suggest that, even when the two disconnected hemispheres receive different information, the commissurotomized brain works as a single and unified organism.\r"

One of the two cases was a left-handed male with a subcortical haemorrhage and the other a right-handed male with a cerebral infarct. The MRI and CT scans showed that the first case had a lesion that mainly involved the right precentral gyrus and its deep white matter, and that the second had a lesion mainly affecting the lower parts of the left precentral and postcentral gyri and their deep white matter. These findings and a literature review suggest that a corticosubcortical lesion of the lower part of the left precentral gyrus in most right handers and a lesion of the symmetric region in the right hemisphere in some left handers cause apraxia of speech. The omission errors for sounds articulated by the tongue and the hard palate were analysed using electropalatography, which records visually the dynamics of the palatolingual contact. The results demonstrated that there were three kinds of omission errors: true omissions (no palatolingual contact); omissions with incorrect contact (palatolingual contact for a different sound or undifferentiated sound); and omissions with correct contact (correct palatolingual contact for a target sound). The latter two types of omission error were observed for initial consonants and they were probably caused by a delay in air flow. The patients also showed a tendency to substitute one of the two consonants/t, t/for other sounds, which suggested that they had difficulty in the inhibition of tongue activity.\r"

The program is voluntary and is centralized at Cadham Provincial Laboratory, in Winnipeg. A filter card blood specimen is collected from newborns on discharge from hospital, and a filter card urine sample is collected and mailed to the laboratory by the mother when the infant is about 2 weeks of age. The overall compliance rates for the blood and urine specimens are approximately 100% and 84% respectively. The blood specimen is screened for phenylalanine and other amino acids, thyroxine, galactose, galactose-1-phosphate and biotinidase. The urine specimen is screened for amino acids, including cystine, as well as methylmalonic acid and homocystine. Between 1965 and 1985, 83 cases of metabolic disorders were detected, including 23 cases of primary hypothyroidism, 14 of classic phenylketonuria, 5 of galactosemia variants, 3 of galactosemia, 2 of maple syrup urine disease and 1 of hereditary tyrosinemia. The direct cost per infant screened is $5.50, and the cost:benefit ratio is approximately 7.5:1. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening is being made available as the necessary supporting clinical facilities become available. On the basis of this experience, the author outlines the components that are important for an effective screening program.\r"

Of the 81 cases in British Columbia 51% involved peritonitis, 21% ileocecal disease, 20% anorectal disease, 10% mesenteric lymphadenitis, 1% disease of the sigmoid colon and 1% disease of the liver. The rate of bacteriologic confirmation was low (51%).\r"

An examination of costs at the Toronto-Bayview Regional Cancer Centre and Sunnybrook Medical Centre, Toronto, suggests that this perception is not accurate. The cost of chemotherapeutic agents administered on an outpatient basis over 4 to 6 months in established drug protocols ranged from $260 to $5374 (mean $2224). The total cost of outpatient administration was estimated to be $152.53 per dose, compared with $185.39 for inpatient administration of the same protocol, a difference of 22%. The difference was predominantly due to a higher allocated per-diem charge at the medical centre. The results indicate that outpatient administration reduces the overall cost of chemotherapy.\r"

Data were collected from insertion site swabs, intracutaneous and intravascular catheter segments, and blood cultures. Surveillance site cultures at the time of dressing changes showed that bacterial growth, once established, persisted until removal of the catheter but that the time of onset of infection was not predictable. Gram's staining alone and Gram's staining combined with culture were tested for their ability to predict catheter colonization and catheter-related infection. Bacteria seen with Gram's staining invariably denoted catheter colonization. When bacteria were not seen with Gram's staining, positive results of culture did not change the pretest probabilities of colonization or infection; however, negative results of culture reduced the probability of colonization to low levels (likelihood ratio less than 0.06). We conclude that Gram's staining and culture of skin swabs from the entry site provide, without line removal, a simple, inexpensive and practical test for the diagnosis of catheter-related infection.\r"

As a group they have the highest birth rate, the lowest cesarean section rate and one of the highest perinatal death rates in Canada. We reviewed the obstetric experience of 512 Inuit women who either gave birth at Stanton Yellowknife Hospital or were referred from Yellowknife and gave birth at a southern facility between January 1981 and December 1985. Our experience is consistent with that documented in earlier reviews, which concluded that Inuit women tend to have efficient uterine action, to endure labour well and to rarely have dystocia. During the periods covered by these reviews delivery was frequently in the settlements; now hospital delivery is the norm. Substantial improvements in perinatal outcome are evident, but there remains a considerable gap between the northern and southern experience. Those attempting further progress must recognize that the need for obstetric care away from the home community is not fully appreciated by Inuit women, their families or their communities.\r"

The improvement was sustained for 6 months in 11 of the 24. Other investigators have found higher response rates than those that we report. The differences are likely due to our enrolment of consecutive patients, the length and completeness of follow-up, and the objective measurement of quality of life by an interviewer not associated with the rehabilitation program. Controlled trials of respiratory rehabilitation measuring both costs and benefits are warranted. In the meantime, strategies to maintain the initial improvement seen after rehabilitation should be developed and studied.\r"

The success of consultations involving a hidden diagnosis depends on how well the patient can express his or her concerns to the doctor and on how skilfully the doctor can encourage this. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of having patients complete a brief health index questionnaire designed to help them describe their underlying concerns to the doctor. In two family medicine centres 996 patients were asked to complete a questionnaire while waiting to see the doctor; 724 (73%) did so. An evaluation of their responses showed the method to be acceptable to most. The doctors judged that it added valuable information in 41% of all consultations and in 73% of consultations in which the patient presented with psychologic complaints. There was, nevertheless, considerable variation among the physicians in their acceptance of the approach. This variability is discussed in the light of alternative models of how, in practical terms, to treat the psychosocial dimensions of a patient's complaint.\r"

Of the 559 children 31% were not covered by medical insurance. Twenty-four of the children were admitted to the hospital, and one died at the Expo site. Most of the illnesses were upper respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis. The proportion of visits for trauma was 50%, compared with the yearly average of 25%. There was a 6% increase in the workload in the emergency department during the fair; the percentage was even higher during July and August, particularly after 1800 hours.

  ".W": "Among 237 patients with grossly noninvasive (intrathyroidal) papillary carcinoma of the thyroid treated by surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital and followed for a median of 14 years, no patient had tumor recurrence either in the thyroid bed or opposite lobe. There were 12 metastatic recurrences with risks of recurrence 4.0% and 6.9% at 10 years and 20 years respectively. Eight of these recurrences were restricted to cervical lymph nodes and did not herald the development of more serious recurrent disease. The remaining recurrences were lung metastases in four patients, two of whom died, accounting for the only deaths from thyroid carcinoma in this series. Factors that influenced the risk of recurrence included lymph node metastases at initial surgery, large tumor size, and to a lesser extent, male sex. The majority of patients (176) had subtotal thyroidectomies, mostly lobectomy (131 patients). There was no evidence that the 61 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy fared better than those with similar patient and tumor characteristics on whom subtotal procedures were performed. The overall findings of this study strongly support the concept that intrathyroidal thyroid carcinoma can be successfully treated by conservative surgery.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 38 patients with a median age of 70 years and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated using a cobalt 60 U or a 6-MeV linear accelerator. A direct field or two opposite fields covered the palpable spleen area in most patients. 100 cGy were administered weekly for a total dose of 10 Gy, given over 10 weeks. The stage arrangement (according to Rai) for the 32 evaluable patients was as follows: Stage I: 11 patients, Stage II: nine patients, Stage III: three patients, and Stage IV: nine patients. Patients in Stages I and II were treated when symptomatic. Twenty-five patients (78%) achieved hematologic response (HR), defined as normalization of the differential leukocyte count, of the total blood cell count, and of bone marrow infiltration. However, no complete response according to the standard criteria of response has been obtained. The median response time of HR was 7 months (range, 1.5 months to greater than 120 months). The overall median survival time from the start of splenic irradiation (SI) was 40 months. More than 50% splenomegaly reduction was obtained in 63% of patients, whereas no benefit was verified in the lymphadenopathy. The incidence of second tumor was 29%. Fourteen patients benefited from a further 21 SI cycles. SI does not result in a complete remission and therefore cannot modify the course of CLL. This treatment is most advisable for elderly patients with predominant bone marrow lymphocytosis, for patients with previous extensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and for patients with poor marrow reserve. Moreover, because of the absence of toxicity subsequent treatment is not compromised.\r"

Alterations in c-erbB-1 and c-erbB-2 correlated with histologic type of tumor and were more common in advanced cancers. Allelic deletions of c-ras-Ha or c-myb were frequently observed in primary tumors which recurred or progressed after surgery (five of six). Analysis of protooncogenes may provide insights into the pathogenesis of lung cancer and may aid in predicting clinical behavior.\r"

Biologic properties of these cell lines (designated CS-C1, CS-S1, CS-S2, and CS-S3) were examined. Cells of one line (CS-C1) had an epithelioid shape and grew in monolayers (C-type). The cells showed alkaline phosphatase activity, stained positively with antikeratin antiserum, and had an ultrastructure with carcinomatous characteristics. Cells of the other three cell lines (CS-S1, CS-S2, and CS-S3) had an irregular shape and grew in multilayers (S-type). Most of the cells did not show alkaline phosphatase activity. They stained, not with antikeratin antiserum, but in fibrillar array with antifibronectin antiserum. Their ultrastructure had sarcomatous characteristics. By low cell density cultures, S-type sublines arose from CS-C1 cell line, but no C-type sublines arose from CS-S1 cell line. These findings may support the theory of the combination tumor as the cytogenesis of mixed mesodermal tumor of the ovary; they also suggest the conversion of carcinomatous cells to sarcomatous cells.\r"

Forty-four cases (72%) had both a nodular and diffuse pattern; eight cases were nodular; nine cases were diffuse. Forty-three patients (70%) had Stage III or IV disease; four patients were Stage I (7%); 14 were Stage II (23%). Bone marrow was involved in 15 of 56 evaluable patients (27%). The median survival was 57 months. It was significantly shorter in symptomatic patients (median, 20 months) than in asymptomatic patients (median, 66 months; P = 0.002). Survival time was also shorter in Stage III and IV patients (median, 46 months) compared with Stage I and II patients (median, 100+ months; P = 0.032). Survival was independent of the disease pattern, marrow involvement, age, gender, and surface immunoglobulin heavy or light chain. Among Stage III and IV patients, survival was the same in patients who received therapy initially and in those who were treated expectantly. Among 10 advanced-stage patients who did not initially receive therapy, the median time to beginning therapy was 17 months; five patients received no therapy for 40 to 96 months. Among 14 advanced-stage patients receiving therapy regarded as curative in aggressive lymphoma, 50% experienced a complete remission (CR). However, unlike other aggressive large cell lymphomas, long-term, relapse-free survival was observed in only 9% of patients as the majority of CRs were associated with relapse rather than cure. Despite the fact that it is a large cell lymphoma, LCCL is best regarded as an indolent lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic value of lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), expressed in months and obtained by means of a linear regression, has been studied in 99 previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. LDT is defined as the period of time needed for lymphocytes to double in number the amount found at diagnosis. When the analysis was extended to the whole population, it showed clear differences in the life expectancy of patients with LDT of less than or equal to 12 months (median survival, 36 months; relative death rate [O/E]1.57) compared with those with LDT of more than 12 months (median survival not yet reached; O/E, 0.37) (P less than 0.001). The significance of LDT remained even after adjustments were made for age, sex, lymphocyte count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The lack of statistical significance after adjustment for Binet's clinical stage corresponds to the fact that clinical stages are not distributed homogeneously, high LDT being more frequently associated with earlier stages and low LDT with more advanced forms of the disease (P less than 0.001). In this study LDT was a useful parameter in predicting disease progression. Patients in Stages A and B and with rapidly increasing lymphocytes counts became worse more frequently (33.3% and 29.1%, respectively, at 12 months after diagnosis) than those with a slow increase (no change in clinical stage at 12 months). It is concluded that since LDT appears to predict the progression of the disease, it is useful in the clinical management of CLL.\r"

Thirteen percent died of their thymomas and 16% died of myasthenia. Overall 5-year survival was 67% and 10-year survival was 53%. Poor prognostic factors included presence of tumor-related symptoms, large tumor size, local invasion or metastasis in initial operation, and predominantly epithelial histologic features. Although true thymomas are composed of cytologically benign elements, they show a propensity for local invasion and intrathoracic recurrence. They rarely metastasize outside the thorax.\r"

The various subsets of fibrocystic disease were highly associated with each other. Such lesions as apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis, and lobular microcalcification showed as much difference according to ethnic/racial background and age as the more common cystic change and duct epithelial hyperplasia. Atypical lobular and ductal hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, and occult invasive carcinoma were uncommon and also occurred in ethnic/racial groups in a pattern that parallels the cancer risk in those groups.\r"

The extent to which the biological potential of these neoplasms is revealed in their pathologic features is the subject of this article. Using guidelines developed in experimental models, a series of 400 transitional cell neoplasms selected for long-term follow-up were classified into the WHO system. The results indicate that (1) almost all transitional cell tumors can be grouped into low and high grades at initial presentation; (2) the low grade lesions (usually designated transitional cell carcinoma, Grade I) are benign and should be called papillomas rather than carcinomas; (3) the risk of progression is not a function of the number of recurrences for these noninvasive, low-grade, papillary tumors; (4) the high-grade neoplasms are aggressive whether papillary or nodular and account for greater than 93% of tumor-related deaths; (5) patients with high-grade lesions have a reduced life expectancy even if progression does not occur; (6) depth of invasion and growth pattern are limited as predictive factors compared with histologic grade; (7) histologic grading of the initial tumor tissue can be highly predictive of outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Among the rare occurrences of primary malignant mesenchymal tumors of the liver, the development of liposarcoma has been only theoretically listed--there is no proven example in the literature. This article documents a case of primary liposarcoma of the liver in a 30-year-old woman who presented with a huge intrahepatic tumor in the left lobe measuring 14 X 10 X 6 cm. It was composed of two distinct macroscopic and histologic features--the well-differentiated liposarcoma and the cellular, nonlipogenic pleomorphic sarcoma. The former was a mature, lipomatous tumor with various stages of lipoblasts. The latter was much more cellular, made up of pleomorphic cells admixed with a few areas of spindle cells with many mitotic figures, resembling a pleomorphic variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Oil red O stain revealed multifocal, but a scanty amount, of fat-storing tumor cells in both compartments aside from large fat globules in the differentiated area. This is the first reported case of primary liposarcoma of the liver.\r"

  ".W": "This article documents the clinical course of nine patients diagnosed as having malignant histiocytosis of the intestine (MHI). Five patients had a history of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This tumor commonly affects the small bowel in a widespread, patchy fashion causing ulceration, stricture formation, and perforation. Metastases to mesenteric nodes, liver, and the bone marrow were common. Although the diagnosis of MHI was often made at laparotomy, surgical resection, even when extensive, was not curative in any case. All nine patients were treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimes. This tumor proved chemosensitive, although response was usually brief and difficult to accurately evaluate. Chemotherapy was poorly tolerated because these patients were malnourished. In two cases small bowel perforation occurred, and in one gastrointestinal bleeding occurred after chemotherapy. Eight patients have died of disease from 0 to 16 months after the diagnosis was made, and a single patient is apparently cured 5+ years after completing chemotherapy. Malignant histiocytosis of the intestine has a characteristic clinical course. It is hoped that increased clinical awareness and early diagnosis will improve the outcome.\r"

The overall analysis showed a wide variability of LI values, from 0.01% to 31.7%, with an exponential distribution and a median value of 8.0%. Similar median LI values were observed for the various metastatic sites, and no difference was found between patients who only had surgery and those who also received systemic therapy. Cell kinetics and patient age and sex were not related in terms of extent and type of nodal involvement. Conversely, a trend toward higher proliferative activity was observed in amelanotic (8.3%) than in melanotic (5.9%) lesions (P = 0.08). The follow-up study on a series of 48 Stage II patients has shown a higher probability of 2-year survival for patients with slowly proliferating tumors than for those with rapidly proliferating tumors (86.9% versus 40.4%, P = 0.054). Along with this finding, the absence of a relationship between cell kinetics and both the main host and tumor characteristics indicated that cell kinetics was a prognostic variable and could be an important tool in the evaluation of patients with metastatic melanoma.\r"

The results were compared with others from another group of nine patients (Group B) treated with CDDP, but without verapamil and cimetidine. In Group A there was much less of a decrease in ERPF as compared to Group B on day 21.

As in other sites, we categorized the dominant histologic pattern as diffuse or filigree, the latter carrying a more unfavorable prognosis. The radiographic appearance may be atypical as compared to Ewing's sarcoma at other sites. Prognosis of head and neck Ewing's is significantly better than Ewing's sarcoma overall. The gnathic bones were commonly affected, yet there was no associated mortality. No patient with primary disease in the bones of the head and neck who survived for 5 years on any of the IESS protocols has subsequently died.\r"

Average annual age-adjusted rates (1973-1980) ranged between 2.0 and 3.6 per 100,000 persons. Significant regional variation in HD was confined to elevated rates in Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland, and low rates in Hawaii, Atlanta, and New Orleans. In young adults (ages 20-34 years) HD was positively associated across regions with rates for children (ages 5-14 years), and with community-wide socioeconomic status (SES), but did not vary with older adult rates. Patterns of geographic variation differed among the histologic subtypes, with no significant variation for the lymphocyte predominance form. Incidence of nodular sclerosis increased with regional SES, and was inversely correlated with rates of lymphocyte predominance. Among women, HD incidence became less heterogeneous across regions with time.\r"

  ".W": "The first year of registration of colorectal tumors in a predominantly urban population (263,546 inhabitants) of northern Italy gave us the opportunity to investigate: (a) the incidence (crude, age-specific, age-standardized) of both colorectal cancer and polyps and their localization; (b) the familial occurrence of these neoplasms; and (c) if the data could fit into the \"Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence.\" Crude incidence of cancer was 52.8 new cases/100,000 in 1984, with 53.4 cases in men and 52.2 cases in women. The corresponding figures for polyps were 59.6 new cases, with 83.4 in men and 37.3 cases in women. The incidence increased with age for both cancer and polyps, although the latter were more frequent until patients were in their sixties and the peak of incidence of polyps anticipated that of cancer by a 5 year period. Both cancer and polyps had a similar distribution in the large bowel, more than 60% being located in the left distal portion. There were 72 cases of colorectal cancer among the first-degree relatives of the registered patients compared with 16 in the controls (RR = 4.26, chi 2 = 27.2 p less than 0.001). An increased frequency of cases of colorectal cancer in the families was found in both the cancer group and the polyp group. In conclusion, the observed incidence of large bowel tumors was similar to that of other well-developed countries. The earlier rise and peak of age-specific incidence of polyps as compared to cancer, the similar distribution of benign and malignant neoplasms in the various intestinal tracts, and the similar familial aggregation observed both in the cancer and in the polyp groups further support the \"polyp-cancer sequence\" and provide us with a promising strategy for the prevention of colorectal malignancies.\r"

Sixty-one cycles of CAP were administered (mean, 4.7 cycles per patient). Eleven patients were treated for palliation of recurrent disease (locoregional, ten; lung, ten; liver, three; and bone, three). Two patients untreated previously, one with extensive local disease involving the base of the skull and one with a solitary lung metastasis (resected with a positive margin) and an initially unappreciated base of tongue primary, received two cycles of CAP followed by local treatment and adjuvant CAP. Previous therapy for the 11 patients with recurrent disease included surgery (ten), radiotherapy [RT(11)], chemotherapy (three), or hormonal therapy (two). Three complete and three partial responses to chemotherapy were noted for an overall response rate of 46%. The median duration of response in palliative patients was 5 months (range, 2 to 9). Of the two patients receiving induction CAP, one relapsed with distant disease 26 months after treatment, and the other remains disease-free after 60 months of follow-up examination. Chemotherapy was well tolerated generally, and no chemotherapy-related deaths occurred. One hypertensive patient suffered a stroke after 3 cycles of therapy. CAP is an active regimen against salivary gland carcinomas and deserves further study. Also, it may be of value as induction or adjuvant treatment for patients with advanced disease untreated previously.\r"

An overall objective response was obtained in 17 patients (30%), five previously treated (23%) and 12 untreated (35%). The median days for response after the start of treatment was 14 d (range, 5 to 64), and the median duration of response was 62 days (range, 28 to 278). The dose-limiting factor was leukopenia, while thrombocytopenia was also experienced. Gastrointestinal reactions to toxicity and alopecia were also observed, but they were not overwhelming. The study demonstrated that the VP-16-213 soft gelatin capsule given orally is effective against small cell lung cancer without clinical cross-resistance to other cytotoxic agents. Its usefulness in combination chemotherapy is thus suggested.\r"

Seventy-four patients were entered and two were ineligible. Sixty-nine of the 72 were histologically reviewed. Six patients were declared ineligible after this review. Fifty-six patients received FAC-S, and nine received FC-S (one patient was inevaluable). The response rates were 31% and 22%, respectively. The median survival of all patients was 10.8 months. The analyses of various clinical and histologic parameters indicated that responses were more common in patients with gastrintestinal carcinoids; there was also a tendency toward shorter survival in patients with tumors that had a higher mitotic rate or the atypical and/or undifferentiated histologic pattern. The FAC-S combination can produce objective responses in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors, but these are generally partial and brief. It was also concluded that currently available chemotherapy is inadequate.\r"

Calcineurin-positive cells were found in all peripheral nerve cell tumors and the two gangliogliomas, whereas 20 of the 27 medulloblastomas and one of the two cerebral neuroblastomas did not contain calcineurin-positive cells. Differentiation of cells along the neuronal lines was positively correlated with calcineurin immunoreactivity. NSE-positive cells were found in all of the tumors with the exception of the one cerebral neuroblastoma. NSE immunoreactivity was not invariably consistent with calcineurin immunoreactivity and non-neuronal cells were often positive. Calcineurin-positive cells were all devoid of GFAP, but NSE-positive cells expressed GFAP in some tumors. GFAP-immunoreactive cells were found only in central nerve cell tumors, and not in peripheral tumors.

To determine whether exposure to TNF-alpha would have an inhibitory effect on hematopoietic progenitors, we incubated normal human bone marrow with a wide range of concentrations of recombinant human TNF. In order to mimic the conditions that would be used in bone marrow purging, bone marrow cell suspensions were incubated with TNF in doses ranging from 500 to 100,000 U/ml for 24 hours, and were assayed for colony formation in agar. We noted a dose-dependent inhibition of total colony-forming units (CFU) at days 7 and 14, with 50% inhibition occurring at 60,000 U/ml of TNF. TNF exerted a differential effect on CFU so that colony formation by erythroid (CFU-E), multipotential (CFU-GEMM), and macrophage (CFU-M) progenitors was suppressed to a greater extent than that by granulocyte progenitors (CFU-G). However, even after preincubation with TNF at high doses such as 100,000 U/ml, the inhibitory effects of TNF could be abolished by washing cells before culturing. This study demonstrates that hematopoietic precursors survive treatment with TNF at doses that have been shown to be cytotoxic to tumor cells. Although TNF has a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of erythroid, multipotential, and macrophage progenitors in vitro, this effect depends on continuous exposure to TNF for more than 24 hours. Thus, TNF may be useful as a bone marrow purging agent against tumor cells, with relative sparing of normal marrow elements.\r"

The two-fold aim of the study was to identify the most useful tools that would more accurately characterize these patients and to deal with the problem of classifying these lymphoproliferative disorders. The data presented in this article suggest that a single parameter may not be sufficient to define the nature of the proliferating cells or to predict the clinical course of the disease and prognosis for the patient. The use of a multiparameter approach, however, may reach this goal, thus providing important prognostic and therapeutic information. Our study supports the concept that lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes is a heterogeneous disorder that ranges from indolent and possibly reactive conditions to the manifestation of aggressive malignancies.\r"

Many tumor cells had rod-shaped intranuclear fibrillary inclusions which consisted of 60 A microfilaments. These intranuclear inclusions reacted with antiactin antibody and were considered to be F-actin bundles. The cells having intranuclear inclusions were frequently found in areas close to the cystic space, and inclusions of tumor cells close to the cyst were thicker. However, mitotic figures were predominantly found in the periphery of the tumor. Intranuclear actin is known to be mainly soluble G-actin, and one of its important functions is reported to be the chromosome condensation in mitosis. It is speculated that the cells having intranuclear fibrillary inclusions of actin have impairment of mitosis.\r"

Antigens A, B, and H compatible with the ABO status of fetuses were detected in 20 of the 22 fetal tissues that were examined. Lewis-b immunoreactivity was also found in 21 fetuses, and Lewis-a was present in a third of the cases. In adult endometrium the expression of BGA H and Lewis-b was considerably lower than in fetal tissues. Malignant endometrial glands extensively reexpressed H and Lewis-b regardless of ABO status. BGA A and B were neither absent nor accumulated in cancer tissues. Thus, H and Lewis-b can be considered as oncofetal antigens since they were frequently expressed in fetal and cancer tissues, but not in normal adult tissues. The increased expression of Lewis-a antigen might be associated with malignant transformation as it was observed only in malignant tissues. However, the functional significance of alterations in BGA expression that may be associated with oncogenesis remains to be investigated.\r"

The specificity of the antibody for breast cancer was assessed by an immunohistochemical method. Mean CEA levels in the nipple discharge from 18 patients with benign breast diseases (ten intraductal papilloma; eight fibrocystic disease) was 43 ng/ml (SD, 34 ng/ml), suggesting an upper reference limit of 100 ng/ml. Six of seven nonpalpable breast cancer patients had higher CEA levels than this tentative cutoff value, as did three of five patients with borderline lesions. The incidence of elevated CEA levels in nipple discharge correlated significantly with the incidence of intratumoral antigen expression. These results lead us to conclude that CEA measurement in nipple discharge may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast cancer.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 11 months to 23 years; and seven patients were 12 years of age or younger. The most frequent presenting sign was the finding of an abdominal mass. This was associated with pain in five patients. In three patients the pain was severe due to torsion, causing an acute abdominal emergency. Slight virilization was observed in one patient only. Two patients had elevated serum alphafetoprotein (AFP), which correlated well with disease activity. The remaining patients had normal serum AFP. All the tumors were unilateral. At laparotomy the tumor was intact in six patients and ruptured in three. The tumors ranged from 8 to 22 cm, were round or oval, and cystic or solid and cystic. Eight tumors were in FIGO Stage I, and one was associated with abdominal metastases and was Stage III. Histologically, the retiform component varied from moderate to predominant in eight of the nine cases. In two tumors a heterologous component composed of striated muscle was also present. Three patients developed metastases. Two of the patients died 11 months and 2 years after diagnosis and the third patient was lost to follow-up with evidence of disease 2 years after diagnosis. The remaining six patients were well and disease-free for periods of 8 months to 6 years. The majority of these tumors were misinterpreted as serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma or endodermal sinus tumor, which are more malignant neoplasms requiring different therapy. This further underlines the importance of recognizing this histopathologic entity.\r"

Dark tobacco smoking was the strongest risk factor, with an RR 2.5 times higher than that showed by light (flue-cured) tobacco smokers and 35 times that of non-smokers. Alcohol exposure displayed lesser effects but its interaction with tobacco smoking resulted in very high risks (more than 100 times higher). Among particular types of alcoholic beverages, red wine showed RR's similar to those displayed by hard liquor consumption. The habit of drinking a local tea called \"mate\" was associated with a threefold increase in risk, after controlling for the effects of age and tobacco and alcohol consumption. Infrequent consumption of vegetables and fruits showed RR on the order of 2.7, suggesting a role of diet in the causation of laryngeal cancer.\r"

The 5-year survival rate for T1N0M0 and T2N0M0 was 100% and for T3N0M0 66%. Although a high percentage of the young patients presented for treatment with advanced disease, the survival rate compared the same or favorably with rates in older patients. This supports the concept of aggressive treatment when there is a recurrence or second primary, particularly because it is well tolerated in the young age group who do not exhibit many of the conventional risk factors and therefore, have a better prognosis.\r"

The remaining 28 (6%) had adenocarcinoma with colloid features. Compared to patients with pure adenocarcinoma, the 5-year actuarial survival of patients with colloid carcinoma was lower in the colon, rectosigmoid/rectum, and colorectum. Patterns of failure, expressed as the actuarial incidence of failure at 5 years, were examined by histologic condition and stage. Patients with Dukes' Stage B colloid carcinoma had a higher incidence of total failure, and patients with Dukes' Stage C colloid carcinoma had a higher incidence of local, abdominal, and total failure. None of the differences reached statistical significance. The presence of colloid carcinoma may have a real but small impact on the patterns of failure and survival in colorectal cancer.\r"

Seventy-two hours after an intravenous injection with 2 mg/kg of the photosensitizer dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE) (Photofrin II, Photomedica, Raritan, NJ), each patient received cystoscopic light treatment. The light dose to the whole bladder using the bulb diffuser ranged from 5 to 60 J/cm2; power density ranged from 9 to 22 mW/cm2. The focal light dose ranged from 100 to 200 J/cm2 at a power density from 100 to 200 mW/cm2. To treat the urethra, a diffuser fiber was used to deliver 200 to 400 J/linear cm at a power of 110 to 300 mW/cm. In the 19 of 23 patients who were treated for resistant superficial TCC, 83.3% of the tumors had responded at the initial follow-up evaluation. Seven patients had a complete response and 10 had a partial response. Three of 19 patients who received inadequate light treatment failed to respond. Control of intractable gross hematuria was the only benefit for patients with locally invasive disease (greater than or equal to T2). Irritating lower urinary tract symptoms that varied in severity and duration occurred in all patients. Four patients experienced bladder shrinkage, which did not resolve. Although the light and drug doses remain to be determined, a whole bladder light dose of 15 to 20 J/cm2 with a drug dose of 2 mg/kg seems to be effective enough without producing permanent adverse effects in the bladder.\r"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum enzymes were obtained preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively in the recovery room and for three consecutive days. ECG leads II, V1 and V5 were monitored continuously during anaesthesia. Patients who had had a subarachnoid haemorrhage and a high incidence of abnormal preoperative ECG (42 per cent). Ten patients developed ECG changes intraoperatively, but these changes were unrelated to isoflurane-induced hypotension. Fifty-three per cent of patients developed an abnormal postoperative ECG. These abnormalities consisted mostly of nonspecific ST segment or T wave changes. At no time was there an elevation in cardiac enzyme activity. We found that nonspecific ECG changes are relatively common in patients undergoing vascular neurosurgical procedures. There was no enzymatic evidence of myocardial infarction and we can only speculate that these ECG changes are related to intracranial surgical manipulation.\r"

Sixty ASA physical status I or II patients in three age ranges (0-1 yr, 1-3 yr and 3-10 yr) were anaesthetized with thiopentone, halothane and nitrous oxide. Each patient received either a single paralyzing dose of DTC 0.4 mg.kg-1, or DTC 0.36 mg.kg-1 preceded three minutes earlier by pancuronium 0.007 mg.kg-1. Evoked force of contraction of the adductor pollicis was measured using train-of-four stimulation applied every 12 sec. Time to 90 per cent first twitch depression after a single dose of DTC increased with increasing age (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01), and was 1.6 min (SEM +/- 0.3) in the 0-1 yr group, 1.9 +/- 0.3 min (1-3 yr), and 5.2 +/- 1.2 min (3-10 yr). Time to ten per cent spontaneous recovery after single dose DTC was shorter in older individuals (r = 0.40, p less than 0.05), being 36.4 +/- 5.1 min in infants 0-1 yr, 30.6 +/- 4.6 min (1-3 yr), and 24.0 +/- 2.7 min (3-10 yr).

Their gastric content pH was measured following induction of anaesthesia. These values were compared to those obtained from a control group (n = 20) ranging in age from seven months to nine (3.3 +/- 2.7) years. A gastric content pH value of greater than 2.5 was measured in 23 of the 25 patients who received sodium citrate. There were only two patients in the control group with a gastric content pH greater than 2.5, p less than 0.001, Fisher exact test. Only one child refused to take the medication. The administration of sodium citrate appears to be an effective method of raising the gastric content pH in paediatric patients.\r"

At that point, an infusion of sufentanil, aimed to reach a central compartment concentration of 5 ng.ml-1, was started via CACI. Plasma concentrations of sufentanil, haematocrit, total protein and albumin concentrations, and nasopharyngeal and CPB inflow temperatures were obtained at predetermined intervals before and up to 90 min after the initiation of CPB. Plasma concentrations of sufentanil reached 3.8 +/- 0.4 ng.ml-1 before CPB and approached the 5.0 ng.ml-1 set point (4.7 +/- 0.4 ng.ml-1) over the 90 min of CPB. In conclusion, our results show that it is possible to obtain stable plasma levels of sufentanil on CPB using a pharmacokinetically driven infusion scheme; however, our data suggest that use of such a system may lead to accumulation of drug during CPB.\r"

Dogs anaesthetized with either pentobarbitone, pentobarbitone/N2O, halothane, or halothane/N2O were embolized with venous air into the right atrium at 0.25 to 0.35 ml.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min. The animals were in a supine, head down position. A Doppler ultrasonic probe located over the suprarenal aorta detected arterial bubbles that escaped filtration by the lungs. No bubbles were detected at 0.25 ml.kg-1.min-1, but at 0.30 ml.kg-1.min-1 the incidence was 11 per cent (pentobarbitone), 0 per cent (pentobarbitone/N2O), 33 per cent (halothane), and 63 per cent (halothane/N2O) and at 0.35 ml.kg-1.min-1, 44 per cent (pentobarbitone), 14 per cent (pentobarbitone/N2O), and 56 per cent (halothane). Half of the dogs receiving VAE with halothane/N2O at 0.30 ml.kg-1.min-1 died within the first 10 min of the air infusion. Thus, no animals were studied at the next higher dose (0.35 ml.kg-1.min-1). The results suggest that the occurrence of VAE with nitrous oxide anaesthesia may result in greater haemodynamic consequence and increased likelihood for spillover of the venous bubbles into the arteries if used with halothane as compared to pentobarbitone.\r"

The dibucaine numbers of all the samples were in the normal range of 78 to 86, indicating normal genotypes.

At therapeutic concentrations of 4 to 12 micrograms.ml-1, procainamide inhibited cholinesterase activity 15 to 30 per cent. The authors also showed that the concentration of procainamide required to inhibit 50 per cent of plasma cholinesterase activity was 20 micrograms.ml-1 (I50).

Neuromuscular blockers were injected at the same time with the fentanyl; haemodynamics were recorded with the patients awake (baseline), at two minutes post-induction, and at two and five minutes after intubation. In patients with AS, pancuronium increased heart rate more than vecuronium or atracurium; heart rates were also higher with the pancuronium-metocurine mixture than with vecuronium. Although there were no ECG signs of ischaemia, one patient given pancuronium developed severe hypotension associated with tachycardia. Reductions in SVR after atracurium allowed small but significant (p less than 0.01) decreases in MAP which were well tolerated; one patient, however, did develop severe hypotension. Intubation resulted in significant (p less than 0.01) increases in MAP in the pancuronium-metocurine mixture group. Vecuronium permitted the most stable overall haemodynamic course at all measurement times. In contrast, patients with AI showed stable haemodynamics after vecuronium, pancuronium and the pancuronium-metocurine mixture; one patient became tachycardic following vecuronium. Atracurium caused unexplained elevations in diastolic and mean arterial pressures which were significant when compared to vecuronium (p less than 0.01). These results in increases in PCWP; mean PA pressures and CVP were also increased. These effects of atracurium inpatients with Al need further evaluation.\r"

Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 12 s and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. In the first 60 patients, spontaneous recovery was allowed until ten per cent of initial first twitch height. Then neostigmine (0.005, 0.01, 0.02 or 0.05 mg.kg-1), pyridostigmine (0.02, 0.04, 0.1 or 0.2 mg.kg-1), or edrophonium (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 or 1 mg.kg-1) was injected by random allocation. Dose-response relationships were established from the measurement of first twitch height (T1) ten minutes later.

Intraoperatively pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured in each patient at five different time periods in the horizontal, 24 degrees head up, and 24 degrees head down table tilt positions. The correlation between absolute values and changes in PCWP and CVP, and the degree to which preoperative knowledge of LVEF and RVEF predicted these correlations were examined. Resting LVEF ranged from 0.1 to 0.84. Thirteen of the 23 patients failed to show significant correlation (p less than 0.05) between the absolute values of PCWP and CVP either before and/or after aortic crossclamp. When the correlation coefficients from this analysis were ranked against LVEF, there was a weak but significant correlation before aortic crossclamp (r = 0.41), but not after. The correlation between a change in PCWP and a change in CVP was significant for the 23 patients at all time intervals, before and after aortic crossclamp. However, the prediction of a change of PCWP value from a known change of CVP value ranged in accuracy from +/- 3 mmHg to +/- 12.5 mmHg. The study suggests that if the filling pressures of both ventricles need to be assessed during aortic surgery, then the PCWP and CVP must be independently measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A hysterectomy was required to control massive haemorrhage, and the patient made a full recovery. The increased incidence of placenta accreta over the last three decades is thought to be associated with the concomitant increased frequency of Caesarean section, resulting in an increased incidence of placenta praevia (1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent). Patients with placenta praevia who have had a previous Caesarean section have a remarkably increased risk of placenta accreta. Management of placenta accreta is primarily by control of haemorrhage on delivery of the placenta. Control can be assisted by infrarenal cross-clamping of the aorta and/or intra-myometrial injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha which produces myometrial and vascular contraction. Identification of patients at increased risk, preparation for treatment and effective treatment of placenta accreta will minimize maternal morbidity and mortality.\r"

All six patients had a score of five or more and gave history of either apnoea or a history of moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A preoperative history of apnoea and/or moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia appear to be valuable markers for postoperative complications. A conceptual age of 40 weeks is an acceptable lower limit of age providing there is no history of apnoea or pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".U": "88053213\r", 
  ".W": "We have used the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) inhibitor ryanodine to assess the contribution of the SR to the increase in twitch tension seen on cooling the mammalian myocardium. To select a suitable concentration of ryanodine, i.e., one that will exert a maximal effect at all temperatures studied, concentration-response curves for ryanodine action were constructed at 37 degrees, 29 degrees, and 23 degrees C in ventricular muscle from rabbit and rat. Using a concentration of ryanodine (1 microM) that exerted a maximal effect at all temperatures studied, the ability of ryanodine to inhibit SR function at 37 degrees, 29 degrees, and 23 degrees C was then confirmed by using rapid cooling contractures (RCCs) to provide an indirect assessment of the SR calcium content. To estimate the rest decay of the SR calcium content in the absence and presence of ryanodine (1 microM), RCCs were initiated after a range of rest intervals (0.3-300 seconds) in rabbit muscles maintained at 37 degrees, 29 degrees, or 23 degrees C. In the absence of ryanodine, low temperatures elevated RCCs at all rest intervals studied. In the presence of ryanodine, RCCs were only seen at rest intervals shorter than 2.0 seconds, even at 23 degrees C, the lowest temperature studied. Thus, even at 23 degrees C, ryanodine appears to be effective at inhibiting SR calcium release in muscles stimulated at 0.5 Hz (i.e., after 2 seconds rest). Therefore, using this concentration of ryanodine (1 microM) and a stimulation rate of 0.5 Hz, we have investigated the contribution of the SR to the positive inotropic response to hypothermia. Under these conditions, the positive inotropic response to cooling in rabbit ventricle was almost unaffected by the inhibition of the SR with ryanodine. In rat ventricle, a tissue in which SR calcium release may dominate excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, the inotropic response to hypothermia was still observed, although developed tension was strongly depressed at all temperatures. These results suggest that a change in SR function is not the principal mediator of the large (400-500%) increase in force associated with cooling mammalian ventricular muscle from 37 degrees to 25 degrees C. The ryanodine-sensitive fraction of tension development was greatest at 37 degrees C, suggesting that the relative contribution of the SR to tension development in rabbit ventricle is reduced at temperatures below 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Bolus injections of adenosine increased systolic and diastolic pressures initially (+15 and +13 mm Hg after 100 micrograms/kg) followed by a subsequent reduction in systolic and diastolic pressures (-12 and -16 mm Hg). Heart rate increased during trough blood pressure (R-R interval shortening of 298 msec after 100 micrograms/kg). Adenosine steady-state infusions increased heart rate (+30 beats/min during 140 micrograms/kg/min), systolic pressure (+16 mm Hg), and pulse pressure (+21 mm Hg) but decreased diastolic pressure slightly (-5 mm Hg), resulting in no significant change in mean arterial pressure. Adenosine stimulated respiration, resulting in decreased PaCO2 (41 to 31 mm Hg), increased PaCO2 (101 to 113 mm Hg), and increased pH (7.42 to 7.50). The increased ventilation was not explained by bronchoconstriction, hypotension, or hypoxia. The observed pressor and tachycardic effects are mediated through reflex autonomic mechanisms since they are completely abolished in patients with severe autonomic failure. These autonomic mechanisms probably involve chemoreceptor activation since adenosine is pressor when infused in the aortic arch proximal to the origin of the carotid arteries but depressor when infused in the descending aorta. It is concluded that the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of adenosine observed in normal volunteers are in part due to chemoreceptor stimulation. These findings raise the possibility that adenosine is an endogenous modulator of respiration in man.\r"

That is, under appropriate conditions, pipe flow can be increased markedly for a given pressure gradient, sometimes threefold or more, by nanomolar concentrations of linear macropolymers. The effect of intact and degraded Separan was tested in the open-chest, anesthetized rat, and left ventricular and carotid pressures, aortic blood flow (electromagnetic flow probe on ascending aorta), and the electrocardiogram were recorded. The results indicate that aortic flow, which in control animals was about half the flow reported for conscious rats, increases markedly after injection of Separan. The effect on blood pressure after an initial fall was variable, but the slope of arterial diastolic pressure was consistently steepened. Electrocardiographic changes were unremarkable except for a slow decline in heart rate. Although secondary reflexes undoubtedly influenced the results, the primary mechanism of the polymer appears to involve a reduced resistance to flow. The results are compatible with the proposal that the Toms effect, or some variant of it, is operative in vivo under favorable conditions. If this view is correct, then Separan and two other chemically different macropolymers with similar hemodynamic effects and physical attributes, i.e., linearity and molecular lengths approaching 100 micron, might be prototypes of a novel category of cardiovascular drugs.\r"

To assess the potential of sympathetic neuronal imaging for detection of depressed transport function, serial scintigrams were acquired after the intravenous administration of metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I] to 13 normal dogs, 3 autotransplanted (denervated) dogs, 5 dogs with left ventricular failure, and 5 dogs with compensated left ventricular hypertrophy due to a surgical arteriovenous shunt. Nine dogs were killed at 14 hours postinjection for determination of metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I] and endogenous norepinephrine content in left atrium, left ventricle, liver, and spleen. By 4 hours postinjection, autotransplanted dogs had a 39% reduction in mean left ventricular tracer accumulation, reflecting an absent intraneuronal tracer pool. Failure dogs demonstrated an accelerated early mean left ventricular tracer efflux rate (26.0%/hour versus 13.7%/hour in normals), reflecting a disproportionately increased extraneuronal tracer pool. They also showed reduced late left ventricular and left atrial concentrations of tracer, consistent with a reduced intraneuronal tracer pool. By contrast, compensated hypertrophy dogs demonstrated a normal early mean left ventricular tracer efflux rate (16.4%/hour) and essentially normal late left ventricular and left atrial concentrations of tracer. Metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I] scintigraphic findings reflect the integrity of the cardiac sympathetic neuronal transport system in canine mechanical-overload heart failure. Metaiodobenzylguanidine [123I] scintigraphy should be explored as a means of early detection of mechanical-overload heart failure in patients.\r"

Globally, the macroscopic velocity of propagation follows the behavior associated with propagation in a continuous tissue (except for high values of disk resistance). In addition, the computed spatial extracellular potential along the fiber is a smooth biphasic waveform and does not reflect the underlying discrete cellular structure of the tissue. Other results of the simulations demonstrate the discontinuous nature of propagation and the importance of the structure in arrhythmogenesis. Vmax displays a biphasic behavior as a function of increasing intercalated disk resistance. An initial \"paradoxical\" increase in Vmax (with a simultaneous decrease in conduction velocity) is followed by a decrease that leads to decremental propagation and conduction block. The time constant of the foot of the action potential (tau foot) increases monotonically with increasing intercalated disk resistance. An increase in the leakage current to extracellular space brings about a significant decrease in the action potential duration and a loss of the plateau. This major effect is accompanied by a relatively smaller decrease in conduction velocity. Collision of two activation wavefronts results in a significant (100%) increase in Vmax and a very small (0.6%) decrease in tau foot.\r"

A plasma cell membrane and a vesicular fraction devoid of membrane markers were prepared from hearts of euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats and were used to compare beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors. During daily injection of l-thyroxine, cardiac hypertrophy developed within 4 days and remained unchanged thereafter. The number of membrane-bound beta-receptors increased progressively and plateaued within 2 weeks of thyroxine administration. Vesicular beta-receptors, on the other hand, increased more gradually and to a lesser extent so that after 2 weeks of l-thyroxine injection, they constituted a smaller proportion of the total beta-receptor population compared to normal rats. In contrast, the number of cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors declined rapidly to about 80% of that in euthyroid animals and did not change further for the duration of the study. Membrane-bound and vesicular alpha 1-adrenoceptors were affected to the same extent in hyperthyroidism. During regression of cardiac hypertrophy following cessation of thyroxine administration, alpha 1-adrenoceptors rose rapidly (within 2 days) to normal values while beta-receptors declined more gradually to normal levels within 2 weeks. In hypothyroid rats, there was a significant decline in the density of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, with a shift away from the vesicular fraction. These results indicate that both the total numbers of cardiac adrenoceptors and their distribution between the plasma membrane and vesicular fraction are influenced by the thyroid status.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether 5-hydroxytryptamine is accumulated by adrenergic nerves at sites of endothelial damage and platelet aggregation in vivo. Coronary artery 5-hydroxytryptamine content and response to in vitro adrenergic nerve stimulation were studied in dogs 24 hours following balloon catheter-induced intimal injury. 5-Hydroxytryptamine content was significantly increased in the catheter-damaged arteries, and there was a coincident decrease in the content of norepinephrine. The relaxation caused by acetylcholine was abolished in the catheter-injured arteries, indicating loss of this endothelial cell-mediated function. The normal beta-adrenergic relaxation caused by nerve stimulation was inhibited, and in some cases, contractions resulted; these effects were prevented by serotonergic receptor antagonists. The sensitivity to exogenously added norepinephrine was unchanged, indicating that the changes in the response to nerve stimulation were not due to an altered smooth muscle response to the native neurotransmitter. These observations indicate that following intimal damage, which produces platelet aggregation on the luminal surface of the blood vessel, 5-hydroxytryptamine can assume a transmitter role in coronary artery adrenergic nerves and thereby cause their dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Transient coronary occlusion (15 minutes) does not result in irreversible myocardial injury but is associated with a depression of contractile function sustained for several hours to days (\"stunned myocardium\"). The defect in the contractile process responsible for this phenomenon has been suggested to be causally related to a reduced energetic state, altered excitation or excitation-contraction coupling, or damaged contractile filaments. The purpose of this study was to attempt to exclude one or more of these hypotheses by evaluating the contractile reserve of reperfused myocardium. Regional subendocardial segment function was measured (sonomicrometry) in a control region and in an area (treatment region) perfused by a carotid artery to anterior descending coronary artery bypass in 13 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Dose-response curves were constructed from changes in segment shortening (%SS) in response to intracoronary calcium infusion before ischemia and following 5 or 15 minutes of occlusion and reperfusion (30 minutes). Calcium infusion before ischemia resulted in dose-dependent increases in %SS in the treatment area to a maximum value of 36.6% from a preinfusion value of 25.5% (p less than 0.01), in the absence of changes in control region shortening (23.7%). After 15 minutes of occlusion and reperfusion, treatment area %SS had fallen to a depressed but stable level (46% of preischemic values; p less than 0.01). Subsequent calcium infusion at the same doses as in the preischemic trial produced increases in treatment segment function with return of shortening to control levels at an intermediate dose. At the highest dose, %SS was 35.4%, which was not different from the maximal value found in the preischemic trial. Alterations in heart rate and left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures during calcium infusion were minor and similar before and after ischemia. Calcium-induced increases in regional segment shortening above control levels (113% of control) in reperfused myocardium were sustained with continuous infusion (30 minutes) without deleterious effects on subsequent function. These results demonstrate that stunned myocardium in this model retains a normal contractile reserve in response to calcium, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for postischemic contractile dysfunction involves calcium.\r"

The hearts were perfused retrogradely at 70 cm H2O with a recirculating modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing washed adult pig red cells (hematocrit, 25%). They were electrically paced (180 beats/min), and left ventricular developed pressure (delta P), maximum rate of rise of pressure (dP/dt), CF, and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured. These parameters were found to remain stable for at least 60 minutes. In one group, a single dose of amrinone was added to the perfusate to yield a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Within 5 minutes delta P decreased from 104.0 +/- 7.1 to 65.3 +/- 8.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and dP/dt fell from 1,160 +/- 96 to 658 +/- 78 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.001). In a second group, successive doses of amrinone were added to yield concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 micrograms/ml. There was a progressive decrease in delta P and dP/dt to 66.5 +/- 4.2% and 57.6 +/- 4.8% of initial values, respectively. CF increased progressively from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 6.8 +/- 0.5 ml/min/g. In 3 experiments, amrinone was washed out after achieving the maximum concentration. Depressed mechanical function reversed and delta P and dP/dt returned to control values in each heart. Additionally, CF decreased from 7.6 +/- 0.3 to 5.0 +/- 0.2 ml/min/g. It is concluded that amrinone has concentration-dependent negative inotropic actions in the neonatal piglet heart. Hence, the drug may not be useful in treating heart failure in the human neonate.\r"

Hypoperfusion for 30 minutes was achieved by a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure from 77.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 20.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg in the experimental group (control perfusion pressure after 30 minutes 75.6 +/- 1.2). Hypoperfusion caused a reduction in left ventricular developed pressure to 20.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (versus control 74.8 +/- 3.3, p less than 0.0001), a reduction of coronary flow rate to 4.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min (versus control 19.4 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.0001), and a drop in myocardial oxygen consumption to 0.06 +/- 0.005 ml O2/min (versus control 0.17 +/- 0.01, p less than 0.0001). Myocardial lactate production was increased by hypoperfusion (3.0 +/- 0.6 mumol/min) compared with controls (0.7 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.02), but myocardial creatine kinase release was similar in the hypoperfused and control groups.

When rates were normalized for mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDHm), state 3 respiration was still increased in hypoperfused hearts (24.1 +/- 2.1 ng atoms O/min/IU MDHm) compared with controls (15.5 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.02).

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that acute coronary artery hypertension may damage vascular endothelium and alter vasomotor responses to humoral agents. We examined effects of intracoronary infusion of the endothelium-dependent agent serotonin and two endothelium-independent agents, angiotensin II and methoxamine, on large coronary artery diameter in the blood perfused dog heart. Responses were examined before and 30 minutes after brief periods of coronary hypertension (200 mm Hg for 10 seconds to 15 minutes). In open-chest anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused at constant pressure. Coronary diameter (D) was measured with piezoelectric crystals. At a control perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg, serotonin produced dose-dependent constriction of the large coronary artery (mean +/- SEM; delta D = -22 +/- 10 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -108 +/- 50 microns at 50 micrograms/min). Increasing perfusion pressure to 200 mm Hg increased flow 515 +/- 79% and coronary diameter 509 +/- 9 microns. After 15 minutes of hypertension, when coronary diameter had returned to baseline values, the constriction of the large artery to serotonin was potentiated (delta D = -89 +/- 33 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -207 +/- 45 microns at 50 micrograms/min; p less than 0.05). Hypertension for 1-5 minutes potentiated constrictor responses of large coronary arteries for at least 2 1/2 hours. Removal of endothelium prevented effects of hypertension on constrictor responses of large arteries to serotonin. Hypertension did not alter constrictor responses to angiotension II (1 and 2.5 micrograms/min) or methoxamine (50 and 100 micrograms/min) or the dilator response to acetylcholine (40 micrograms/min). Acute hypertension altered endothelial morphology. There were small endothelial craters following 10 seconds of hypertension, and disruption of endothelial junctions with leukocyte adherence following 1-15 minutes of hypertension. We conclude that acute hypertension alters constrictor responses of large coronary arteries to serotonin by impairing endothelial function and not by directly affecting vascular smooth muscle. These effects of acute hypertension on vascular reactivity are selective in that they do not involve non-endothelium-dependent agents or the endothelium-dependent agent, acetylcholine. The effect of hypertension also persists long after pressure is restored to normotensive levels.\r"

  ".W": "It is not clear what factors contribute to the prompt and reversible decrease in left ventricular diastolic chamber distensibility during angina pectoris that is induced by an increase in myocardial energy demand due to exercise or pacing tachycardia. To simulate the demand ischemia that occurs clinically during pacing-induced angina, we used isolated, blood-perfused rabbit hearts with restricted coronary flow and increased myocardial energy demand. A constant left ventricular balloon volume model was used to measure left ventricular diastolic chamber distensibility during 6 minutes of low-flow global ischemia, induced by a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure from 100 to 20 mm Hg. To investigate the influence of different levels of myocardial energy demand, the effects of two different heart rates were studied during low-flow global ischemia; pacing tachycardia (6.4 +/- 0.2 Hz, n = 7) was compared with the rabbit's baseline heart rate of 4 Hz (n = 7). Low-flow ischemia caused a marked decrease in contractile function relative to the baseline preischemic state. In the pacing-tachycardia group, myocardial energy demand, as estimated by the rate X systolic pressure product, was significantly greater than in the constant heart-rate group. When tachycardia was imposed during low-flow global ischemia, there was a transient and reversible increase in isovolumic left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 14 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 4 mm Hg (measured during long diastoles obtained with transient cessation of pacing) in the pacing-tachycardia group, but there was no increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during low flow ischemia in the constant heart-rate group with lower energy demand (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fluctuations in indo 1 fluorescence were compared with recordings of cell edge movement during spontaneous beating and during stimulation by intracellular current pulses. Indo 1-loaded aggregates exhibit fluorescence transients during each transmembrane action potential. The rising phase of the transients is rapid, but the decaying phase is slow (several hundred msec) and is similar in time course to the pandiastolic relaxation seen in the optical recordings of cell edge movement. Acceleration of beat frequency by brief depolarizing current pulses produces an ascending staircase in both edge movement and systolic [Ca2+]i. There is a similar staircase in the diastolic [Ca2+]i, which is also reflected by diastolic cell edge movement. The existence of a diastolic [Ca2+]i staircase may provide new insight into the mechanism of the force-frequency relation in the heart.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of this theoretical approach in seven patients undergoing electrophysiologic investigation. The atrioventricular nodal recovery curve was determined at two different basic cycle lengths. Subsequently, periodic atrial stimulation was delivered for 30 sec periods over a range of frequencies giving 11, Wenckebach, reverse Wenckebach, and 21 rhythms. The recovery curve data was then used to compute the response to periodic stimulation by an iterative technique. The conduction patterns actually seen during periodic atrial stimulation showed close agreement with the computed patterns. This work thus provides a unified explanation for the appearance of Wenckebach, reverse Wenckebach, alternating Wenckebach, and high grade block rhythms.\r"

Two-dimensionally guided M mode echocardiograms were digitized for wall thickness, cavity dimension, fractional shortening, and peak rates of cavity enlargement and wall thinning. Pulsed Doppler left ventricular inflow recordings were analyzed for peak early and late velocities and their ratio. Left ventricular diastolic dimension was reduced at race finish (5.4 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 0.6 cm) and remained reduced after 1 day of recovery (5.2 +/- 0.6 cm, p less than .05). Fractional shortening fell at race finish (39 +/- 5% to 35 +/- 5%), although systolic blood pressure was unchanged, and rose to 40 +/- 4% after recovery (p less than .05). The return to prerace shortening values after recovery occurred despite continued reduction in diastolic size. Peak circumferential shortening did not change significantly. Individual reductions in fractional shortening were correlated with increases in systolic cavity size (r = -.64, p less than .01), but not with decreases in diastolic size. The stress-shortening relationship was displaced downward at race finish, but returned toward baseline after 1 day of recovery, despite a persistent reduction in cavity size. This suggests that the decrease in shortening was due to impaired contractility as well as altered preload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pacing-induced ischemia on early left ventricular filling and regional myocardial lengthening was studied in 11 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and six control patients with normal coronary arteriograms. All of the 11 patients with CAD developed typical anginal pain during pacing tachycardia, and in the postpacing beat, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) rose from 13 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, p less than .01), the relaxation time constant increased from 43 +/- 9 to 59 +/- 7 msec (p less than .01), and the ejection fraction diminished from 62.1 +/- 6.7 to 51.6 +/- 10.6% (p less than .01). However, the peak rate of early left ventricular filling (LVPF) obtained from frame-by-frame analysis of left ventriculograms and the LVPF normalized for the stroke volume and for the end-diastolic volume did not change significantly. In the ischemic segment, the peak rate of lengthening (PL) decreased by 45% with ischemia, and the PL normalized for the end-diastolic segment length decreased by 42%. However, the PL normalized for the extent of systolic shortening did not change. In the control segment there was a tendency for these three variables to increase, but the changes were not statistically significant. The time difference from the PL to the LVPF increased significantly in the ischemic segment (31 +/- 28 vs 75 +/- 48 msec, p less than .05). Although the LVEDP rose slightly but significantly from 9 +/- 3 to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .05) in the control patients in the postpacing beat, the other global hemodynamic variables and the variables of regional myocardial dynamics did not change. The administration of nifedipine in six patients with CAD resulted in the disappearance or diminution of anginal pain even with the same duration and rate of pacing and was associated with restoration of global systolic function and regional myocardial shortening and lengthening in the ischemic segment. In the control segment, the three variables of segmental lengthening increased with administration of nifedipine. Thus, the segmental myocardial lengthening rate decreased with ischemia due to a decrease in segmental shortening and impairment of myocardial distensibility. The LVPF did not decrease with ischemia despite impairment in isovolumetric relaxation, accentuation of asynchrony in left ventricular filling, and a decrease in the PL in the ischemic segment because of an increase in the PL in the nonischemic segment secondary to an increase in left ventricular filling pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Earlier studies carried out in the 1970s were hampered by the unavailability of satisfactory population data beyond 1970. In the present study we have used 1970 and 1980 census data to compute death rates in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites from Texas for the periods 1969-1971 and 1979-1981. All four sex-ethnic groups showed statistically significant declines in death rates due to all causes, due to total ischemic heart disease, and due to acute myocardial infarction between 1969-1971 and 1979-1981. Declines in the latter two causes of death were least marked in Mexican American men. This sex-ethnic group was also the only one that failed to show a decline in death rates due to chronic ischemic heart diseases. The fact that Mexican Americans have been shown to be less well informed about and less likely to adopt lifestyle changes aimed at reducing heart disease risk than non-Hispanic whites may account for the less striking mortality decline observed in Mexican American men, but is harder to reconcile with the apparent equal decline in Mexican American women compared with non-Hispanic whites.\r"

  ".W": "To estimate the extent of myocardial infarction after coronary artery reperfusion, serum levels of cardiac myosin light chain (LC) I and creatine kinase (CK) were determined serially in 49 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Intracoronary thrombolysis was successful in 25 patients (reperfusion group), and 24 patients were treated in a conventional manner (control group). The peak level of CK appeared significantly earlier in the reperfusion group (11.3 +/- 3.1 hr, mean +/- SD) than in the control group (21.6 +/- 7.2 hr). Cumulative release of CK was significantly related to angiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction 1 month after the attack in both groups (r = -.50; -.45, respectively). However, the amount of cumulative release of CK in the reperfusion group was greater compared with that in those with the same left ventricular ejection fraction in the control group. Peak appearance time of LCI was almost equal in the two groups (3.8 +/- 1.4 vs 3.9 +/- 1.2 days). Peak levels of LCI were related to the left ventricular ejection fraction in the reperfusion group (r = -.63) and in the control group (r = -.74), and the slopes of their regression lines were similar. The cardiac index obtained on the day of onset in the two groups was related to peak levels of LCI but not to total release of CK. These results suggest that serum levels of LCI reflect the changes in left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction, regardless of the presence of coronary reperfusion. Thus, serial determinations of LCI in serum facilitate noninvasive assessment of the effects of intracoronary thrombolysis on infarct size.\r"

The first set of 10 dogs had CT and microsphere measurements before and after chromonar-induced increases in myocardial blood flow. A second set of six dogs had flows measured at control and during temporary reductions in regional flow produced by balloon cuff occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. All dogs had four-slice, 20-instance CT scans after injection of a medium bolus (0.35 ml/kg) of contrast medium into a femoral vein simultaneous with injection of microspheres into the left atrium. CT myocardial flow was calculated as the change in myocardial CT numbers divided by the area from a blood pool time-density curve. A wide range of myocardial blood flows was produced as determined by microspheres (0 to 6.7 ml/min/g). Global flow of the first set of dogs was shown to have excellent correlation (r = .95, n = 17) for a limited range (.4 less than X less than 1.4 ml/min/g) of flows. Regional flows of these measurements demonstrated less correlation (r = .63, n = 110) but extended the range of flow to 1.7 ml/min/g. At higher flows (greater than 2.5 ml/min/g) the correlation for global and regional flows was not significantly different than zero. Regional ischemic flow correlation extended the linear range of flow to 0 ml/min/g (r = .62, n = 17). These results show that CT can measure myocardial blood flow over a limited but clinically relevant range of flows defined as slightly above normal to ischemic. These results indicate that another preparation of CT flow measurement must be sought for quantification of myocardial perfusion values significantly above normal.\r"

Fourteen patients were instrumented with micromanometer left ventricular and right atrial pacing catheters to maintain a constant heart rate during control conditions and infusion of methoxamine or nitroprusside. The isovolumic relaxation period was defined as the time from peak (-)dP/dt to 5 mm Hg above left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of the following beat. The rate of isovolumic relaxation was calculated as time constants (Tau) from the linear regression of natural log pressure vs time (Tln) and instantaneous (-)dP/dt vs pressure (TD), which includes a variable asymptote (PB). The mean heart rates and average (+)dP/dt values normalized at 40 mm Hg development pressure (DP40) did not differ significantly, despite 33% and 43% increases in left ventricular peak and end-diastolic pressures during the infusion of methoxamine (p less than .001 and p less than .01, respectively) and 24% and 29% decreases during the infusion of nitroprusside (p less than .001 and p less than .01, respectively). The average Tln and TD values were not significantly affected by these alterations in load. In two patients, an inverse linear relationship was demonstrated between decreases in Tau and increases in contractile state produced by an infusion of dobutamine, as shown by correlation of Tln and TD with (+)dP/dt/DP40 (r = -.88 and -.83, respectively). We conclude that the time constants of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation are unaffected by modest alterations in loading conditions in man when heart rate is maintained constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From the unlabeled epicardial maps one of us predicted the coronary artery that would be found to be involved in the infarction. These predictions were compared with the results of coronary arteriography and this showed that the analysis of the epicardial map correctly predicted the coronary artery involved in 40 of 55 patients (72.7%). In another eight patients the anatomy was partially predicted. In the 15 patients in whom the prediction was incorrect or partially correct (27.3%), 11 had critical disease or occlusions of the predicted coronary artery but the infarct-related artery was incorrectly identified. This verifies that sensible epicardial potential maps can be calculated from body surface electrocardiographic data, and that these data are sufficiently accurate to predict the vessel involved in acute infarction.\r"

Clinical and experimental studies have shown that body surface potential maps provide improved recognition of some disease states and more regionally selective information than standard electrocardiograms. Body surface maps were recorded at rest from 41 symptomatic patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and normal electrocardiograms. Patient maps were statistically compared with maps recorded from 644 normal subjects with the use of previously reported data representation technique. By this technique, maps from patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease and normal electrocardiograms were separated from maps of normal subjects with a sensitivity and specificity greater than 94%. The majority of discriminating information was present in the QRS interval. Fifteen of the 41 symptomatic patients had documented single-vessel coronary disease and their maps were separately compared with normal maps. Average maps from each of three patient groups with single-vessel disease contained abnormal patterns during the QRS interval that were unique to the vessel affected. In comparison with a average map from normal subjects, the average map from the group with left anterior descending coronary disease showed lower potentials over the anterior and inferolateral thorax during the early to mid QRS interval, the average map from the circumflex disease group showed decreased potentials around the entire inferior thorax in the mid to late QRS interval, and the average map from the right coronary disease group showed decreased potentials over the right anterior thorax during the mid to late QRS interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neodymium:YAG laser photocoagulation was used in the intraoperative treatment of drug-resistant ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 17 consecutive patients. The cause of VT was previous myocardial infarction in 15, sarcoid in one, and idiopathic in one patient. Electrophysiologic studies were performed preoperatively, before hospital discharge, and 8 to 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery. At surgery, laser photocoagulation was performed on the normothermic heart during VT. Surgical mortality was 11.7%. There was one late nonarrhythmic death 35 days postoperatively. There were 55 VT morphologies. Laser successfully abated 52 of 55. Associated use of cryoablation was required in two of 55. One VT in the patient with sarcoidosis was not successfully ablated but was controlled by procainamide. In the long-term survivors with VT due to myocardial infarction the surgical cure rate was 100%, i.e., no spontaneous or inducible VT. Follow-up ranges from 6 to 18 months (mean 11.8 +/- 4.3). Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is an effective addition to the operative treatment strategies for VT.\r"

Although ablation of the His bundle has gained popularity for treating patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia refractory to medical therapy, undesirable sequelae include complete heart block and the necessity for a permanent pacemaker. To obviate this limitation, we have developed a discrete cryosurgical procedure that interrupts the reentrant circuit responsible for AV node reentrant tachycardia without blocking AV conduction. After first characterizing the salutary effects of this approach in experimental animals, we performed this procedure in eight patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative electrophysiologic studies were performed in each patient. Under conditions of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and during atrial pacing at a constant rate with continuous monitoring of AV conduction, nine separate 3 mm cryolesions (-60 degrees C for 2 min) were placed at predetermined sites around the triangle of Koch in the lower right atrial septum. Postoperatively, each patient had a single AV node conduction curve. No patient had AV node reentrant tachycardia induced or has experienced AV node reentrant tachycardia clinically during a follow-up of up to 5 years. The cryosurgical procedure had no detrimental effects on the AH or HV interval or on the paced cycle length at which AV node Wenckebach occurred. Based on these results, this curative operation offers promise for patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia that is refractory to medical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that, in the presence of heart failure, the capability of skeletal muscle to utilize delivered flow may be impaired due to maldistribution of blood flow within working muscle. Similarly, this mechanism could explain the failure of drugs to improve maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) immediately. Accordingly, we assessed muscular blood flow distribution (ml/min/g, radioactive microspheres, 15 +/- 5 micron) among and within working muscle, VO2max, and arterial lactate in a rat preparation of myocardial infarction and heart failure (infarct size 36.0 +/- 3.3% of the left ventricle, n = 9), and in sham-operated animals (n = 11). Data were obtained at maximal treadmill exercise during alternate infusions of milrinone and saline. Total skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise was significantly lower in the infarction group (p less than .05 vs sham); reduced blood flow was primarily attributed to decreased flow to oxidative working muscle such as soleus and the red portion of gastrocnemius, whereas blood flow to glycolytic muscle portions (e.g., gastrocnemius white, vastus lateralis white) was similar in the infarction and sham-operated groups. Milrinone increased flow to the glycolytic working muscle portions in sham-operated animals (e.g., vastus lateralis white, 0.23 vs 0.29, p less than .05); by contrast, blood flow to the oxidative muscle fibers was increased in the infarction group (e.g., gastrocnemius red, 1.45 vs 1.87, p less than .05). Arterial lactate levels at similar workloads during exercise were higher in the infarction group (p less than .05). Neither lactate nor VO2max were significantly altered with milrinone in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The metal-tipped optical fiber or \"laser probe\" has been extensively studied in animal preparations in vivo and in human clinical trials of revascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the thermal characteristics of laser probe tissue ablation and to contrast the vascular tissue response to exposure to the laser probe and bare optical fiber. A 2 mm laser probe was heated with up to 4 W of argon-ion laser irradiation and applied to six postmortem strips of human nonatherosclerotic aorta as well as to five atherosclerotic aortic specimens. Surface temperature maps of the laser probe and of the vascular tissue in air were obtained via 8 to 12 micron thermographic imaging. Laser probe temperature was additionally monitored via thermocouples. Two strips each of normal and diseased aorta were irradiated directly with the bare optical fiber. Thus a total of 43 laser probe application sites and 19 bare fiberoptic laser irradiation sites on a total of 15 aortic strips were analyzed both thermographically and histologically. Based on measured temperature rises and histologic findings, the following observations were made: (1) The laser probe heats initially at its tip and attains a uniform surface temperature distribution within 5 sec. The steady-state temperature attained by the probe is inversely related to the thermal conductivity of the surrounding media. In all media studied, probe temperature increases linearly with applied laser energy. (2) Tissue ablation starts at temperatures greater than 100 degrees C, and ablation temperatures typically exceed 180 degrees C. Adventitial temperatures during laser probe application may reach 70 degrees C. Tissue ablation is enhanced both by greater laser energy deposition in the probe and by higher force at which the probe is applied to tissue. (3) Ablation of fibrofatty atheromata is more extensive than of nonatherosclerotic aortic tissue. This may be due to the lower thermal conductivity of atheromatous tissue. (4) In contrast to direct argon-ion laser ablation of aortic tissue, laser probe-mediated ablation occurs in a controlled fashion, is not associated with extensive subintimal dissections, and allows uniform conduction of heat to tissue as reflected by essentially \"isothermal\" injury lines.\r"

Animals in the \"treated\" segment (n = 15) consumed propranolol, which was mixed into an atherogenic diet. Animals in the \"untreated\" group (n = 15) consumed only the atherogenic diet. Finally, the social groupings were subjected to disruption through monthly redistribution of monkeys among the groups within each treatment segment. The experiment lasted 26 months, following which all animals underwent autopsy during which the coronary arteries were evaluated for atherosclerosis. Regarding atherosclerosis, we observed a significant interaction between social status and experimental condition (p less than .03). Socially dominant animals had (as in previous studies) significantly exacerbated CAA, but only in the untreated segment; the effect of social dominance on CAA was abolished by long-term administration of propranolol. The antiatherogenic effect of propranolol on dominant animals was independent of the influences of serum lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and resting heart rate. We conclude that treatment with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents may confer a degree of protection against CAA among individuals behaviorally predisposed to coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Procainamide, a type 1A antiarrhythmic drug, blocks sodium channels and reduces the maximum rate of rise of the cardiac action potential (Vmax) in a rate-dependent fashion. In vitro, the magnitude of this rate-dependent reduction in Vmax is greater in tissue that is partially depolarized at rest than in tissue with a normal resting potential. Reductions in Vmax produced by drugs that block sodium channels are also directly related to the reductions in longitudinal conduction velocity of action potential propagation in papillary muscle preparations. We therefore sought to determine whether the rate-dependent conduction slowing induced by procainamide in the intact canine heart is enhanced in myocardial tissue abnormally depolarized by an elevated myocardial extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o. QRS duration and epicardial activation times were measured as indexes of myocardial conduction. QRS duration and epicardial activation times were measured at control (4.0 mM) and at intermediate (6.5 mM) and high (9.2 mM) myocardial [K+]o in the presence or absence of a clinically relevant procainamide concentration (12.2 +/- 2.6 g/ml) at the longest obtainable interstimulus interval of 440 msec and at 330, 280, and 250 msec. Intermediate and high myocardial [K+]o alone induced rate-dependent conduction slowing as the frequency of stimulation increased (cycle length 440 msec to 330, 280, and 250 msec). In the presence of procainamide, rate-dependent conduction slowing was observed at all levels of myocardial [K+]o, and the amount of rate-dependent change in conduction time increased as the myocardial [K+]o was increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that overdrive suppression of conduction in depolarized His-Purkinje tissue requires conduction asymmetry. In this study we examined whether overdrive suppression of conduction can occur at the Purkinje-muscle junction, where natural asymmetry of conduction exists. Canine Purkinje-muscle preparations were superfused with hyperkalemic Tyrode's solution (KCl 8 to 12 mM), and action potentials were recorded from Purkinje, junctional, and muscle cells. Initially, the Purkinje fiber was paced at the shortest cycle length at which 1:1 anterograde Purkinje-muscle conduction occurred. The papillary muscle then was paced for 10 to 50 beats at shorter cycle lengths during which, because of conduction asymmetry at the Purkinje-muscle junction, 1:1 retrograde muscle-Purkinje conduction also occurred. After overdrive papillary muscle pacing, Purkinje fiber pacing at the same cycle length that previously resulted in 1:1 conduction now produced transient Purkinje-muscle conduction block (overdrive suppression of conduction). The degree and duration of overdrive suppression of conduction were proportional to the rate and duration of overdrive pacing. After overdrive pacing, Purkinje cell action potential amplitude and Vmax recovered within 300 msec, yet conduction block persisted for up to 7 sec. In contrast, excitability in papillary muscle cells near the Purkinje-muscle junction increased continuously after overdrive pacing. These data suggest that rapid activation of Purkinje cells during overdrive pacing was not required for overdrive suppression of conduction and that restoration of conduction after overdrive pacing was determined primarily by recovery of excitability in papillary muscle cells. Transient Purkinje-muscle conduction block after periods of rapid ventricular rates might account for overdrive-induced conduction disturbances normally attributed to bundle branch block.\r"

We also recorded transmembrane potentials of atrial tissues from the circus path in vitro. In 12 instrumented dogs, average flutter cycle length was 157 msec, the duration of the excitable gap was 73 msec, and conduction velocity was 0.75 m/sec. At 4 and 8 mg/kg, procainamide moderately prolonged cycle length, but did not terminate the flutter. At a cycle length of 300 msec procainamide increased effective refractory period (ERP) by 12% and 20% and conduction time by 8% and 19%. At 16 and 32 mg/kg procainamide prolonged cycle length, ERP, and conduction time by 60% to 80% and stopped the flutter in all trials. NAPA, at 16, 32, and 64 mg/kg, increased flutter cycle length by 16%, 16%, and 31%, ERP by 14%, 28%, and 41%, and conduction time by less than 15%. NAPA terminated the flutter in two of six dogs given 32 mg/kg, and three of five dogs given 64 mg/kg. The excitable gap was lengthened by both procainamide and NAPA. Transmembrane potentials showed that at a cycle length from 1000 to 300 msec procainamide (10 mg/liter) increased action potential duration and decreased the first time derivative of phase O of the action potential (Vmax), whereas NAPA (20 mg/liter) increased action potential duration without changing Vmax. These findings show the difficulty of relating drug effects on transmembrane potentials to efficacy in vivo since the former do not necessarily indicate which changes in cellular electrical activity are responsible for efficacy against a particular arrhythmogenic mechanism.\r"

We also assessed the effects of nitroprusside (NTP) (2 +/- 0.2 micrograms/kg/min) during an identical period of ischemia and reperfusion to independently assess the consequences of altered loading alone on diastolic function. To minimize the effects of temporal dysynchrony and altered ventricular loading conditions on isovolumetric relaxation, we developed a conscious dog preparation of reversible transient (30 to 60 sec) bilateral coronary occlusion (BCO). BCO was characterized by significant systolic depression: maximum (+)dP/dt decreased (from 2617 +/- 600 to 1981 +/- 565 mm Hg/sec, p less than .05), left ventricular transverse dimension shortening diminished (from 20 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 5%, p less than .05), and the left ventricle dilated (42.4 +/- 6.4 to 43.8 +/- 6.3 mm, p less than .05). Concomitantly the time constants of isovolumetric relaxation prolonged (from 22 +/- 3 to 28 +/- 4 msec, p less than .05) and minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure increased (from -3 +/- 6 to 6 +/-6 mm Hg, p less than .05). The passive diastolic pressure-dimension relationship shifted upward and to the right and was associated with increased chamber stiffness (from 0.50 +/- 0.26 to 1.03 +/- 0.53 mm Hg/mm, p less than .05) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 7 +/- 7 to 19 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than .05). Reperfusion immediately after BCO was characterized by prompt restoration of systolic contractile performance [maximum (+)dP/dt 3220 +/- 530 mm Hg/sec] but persistently abnormal early and late diastolic function (time constant of isovolumetric relaxation 30 +/- 6 msec, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 +/- 7 mm Hg). The effects of drug administration on ventricular function during BCO were then evaluated under matched loading conditions. NTP improved time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (20 +/- 8 vs 28 +/- 4 msec, p less than .05) and minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure (2 +/- 5 vs 6 +/- mm Hg, p less than .05) during BCO, but NIF did not (time constant of isovolumetric relaxation 27 +/- 6 msec, minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure 7 +/- 5 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We utilized an exercise protocol in which the work rate was increased continuously and oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics were characterized by linear, first-order dynamics. VO2 at peak exercise (VO2max) was depressed at 12.8 +/- 2.3 ml/min/kg and the anaerobic threshold occurred at 63 +/- 10% of the VO2max. A significant correlation was observed between the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold and the resting cardiac index (r = .74, p less than .05). Ventilation-perfusion relationships improved during exercise, despite the presence of a widened alveolar-arterial gradient in oxygen tension and elevation of the physiologic dead space/tidal volume ratio. At peak exercise, a large breathing reserve (maximal voluntary ventilation-minute ventilation), a decline in arterial carbon dioxide tension, and a slight increase in arterial oxygen tension were observed. Plasma epinephrine levels at peak exercise correlated directly with VO2max (r = .74, p less than .05). Thus, although disturbances in ventilation-perfusion relationships occur in association with heart failure, exercise is not limited by an impairment in pulmonary function. The glycogenolytic action of epinephrine may play an important role in determining peak exercise capacity since glycogen stores are increasingly utilized at work rates above the anaerobic threshold.\r"

The peak exercise responses were as follows: oxygen consumption, 14.5 +/- 3.9 ml/kg/min; heart rate, 132 +/- 24 beats/min; systolic blood pressure, 154 +/- 29 mm Hg. No major complications occurred with the baseline tests. The initial baseline test was stopped in only 10 patients (1.6%) for arrhythmias and in one patient for hypotension. Ventricular tachycardia assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during the second exercise test (before exercise, during exercise, and 4 hr after the test) revealed a prevalence of 5.7% during exercise and 28.8% during the rest of the monitoring period. This study has demonstrated that stable male patients with congestive heart failure can safely exercise on a bicycle ergometer to their peak effort in a well-supervised setting.

Eighteen pairs of femurs were assigned randomly to either the anatomic (A) or the medial displacement (MD) group and instrumented with multiple strain gauges. The femurs in the MD group were tested while intact and following four-part fracture with fixation. The femurs in the A group were first tested intact, followed by a stable two-part fracture with fixation, and then by a four-part fracture with fixation and perfect reduction of the posteromedial fragment (PMF) with a lag screw, partial reduction of the PMF, and with the PMF omitted. All fractures were fixed with a 135 degrees, four-hole, sliding hip screw. The strain distribution in the MD group changed significantly after fracture. The plate tensile strain increased by 360% while the compressive calcar strain decreased 85%. The plate tensile strain in the A group also increased significantly after four-part fracture when the PMF was perfectly reduced (160%), partially reduced (290%), or discarded (275%); the calcar compressive strains for these subgroups decreased approximately 50%. This laboratory study indicates that anatomic reduction of four-part intertrochanteric fractures with the sliding hip screw, regardless of the presence or position of the PMF, provides significantly higher compression across the calcar region and significantly lower tensile strain on the plate than fractures reduced by medial displacement osteotomy. The more physiologic strain distribution and the increased medial load transmission support the use of anatomic reduction for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures.\r"

Uncoated prostheses were surrounded by fibrous tissue and were easily extracted from the femur at any postoperative time. The apatite-coated implants were rigidly fixed within three weeks with demonstrable bone formation up to the implant surface. Bony defects up to 2 mm in depth were filled with bone within six weeks.

Pseudosynovial implant-facing surfaces were present in specimens from all types. The remaining portions of these membranes showed distinct characteristics as well. Cemented implant membranes contained many macrophages and giant cells and evidenced frequent granuloma formation. Press-fit membranes consisted of poorly vascularized, dense fibrous tissue within the loosened press-fit membrane. Macrophages and giant cells were rare, except in one specimen containing ceramic debris particles. Biologic ingrowth membranes were the most vascular and contained loosely organized connective tissue and islands of woven bone. Macrophages were common. One out of six specimens from patients with rheumatoid arthritis contained massive numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells but not mast cells. The greatest numbers of mast cells were present in membranes from patients with osteoarthritis and in all cases were associated with the presence of stainless steel and/or chrome cobalt particles.\r"

The follow-up period was one year. In uncomplicated primary THA, the ESR was slightly elevated before surgery and was variable after surgery; some patients continued to have abnormally high ESRs one year after surgery. However, CRP was normal before surgery and after surgery showed a distinctive pattern that rapidly normalized within three weeks. In patients with a painful hip after THA, ESR was elevated in those with septic loosening and variable in those with mechanical loosening; however, the difference was not significant. ESR after successful revision THA was also variable. CRP was high in patients with septic loosening and normal in those with mechanical loosening. Normalization of CRP was rapid after control of infection or within three weeks of successful revision THA. Uneventful recovery after THA is indicated by normalization of CRP within three weeks, regardless of ESR. Measurement of both ESR and CRP is helpful in differentiating septic and mechanical loosening, detecting complications, and monitoring the effects of treatment, but CRP is more informative and sensitive than ESR for these purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal infants with Ortolani-positive dislocated hips are easily managed by reduction and maintenance of the reduction using a divarication splint, cast, or Pavlik harness. Sixty-six patients with 85 complete, congenitally dislocated hips (Ortolani negative) unassociated with other neuromuscular disorders were examined to assess a method of prereduction traction in the treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip. Forty of the 66 patients were six months of age or younger at the beginning of traction treatment. The remaining 26 were younger than 12 months of age prior to the treatment protocol. Overhead traction with the hip flexed to 90 degrees was employed. Gradual hip abduction to 70 degrees (140 degrees combined abduction) was accomplished over the next ten to 14 days. If the dislocated hip was still in a station above Hilgenreiner's line, then cross traction was applied to add another vector of force to pull the femoral head distally. At an average of 18 days into the treatment protocol, an examination under anesthesia with closed reduction was performed and the patient immobilized in a double hip spica in the \"human\" position for six to eight weeks. This was followed by use of an Ilfeld divarication splint for nine months. This traction/reduction program was effective in 91% of these cases (60 of 66). Six patients (ten hips) required an open procedure because of persistent instability in spite of reducibility. To date, there is no incidence of avascular necrosis using the criteria of Salter for whole head avascular necrosis and the criteria of Kalamchi and MacEwen for partial head avascular necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of treatment of a child with congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) untreated until walking age should be to reestablish the mechanics of the hip joint and avoid complications, especially avascular necrosis, thus delaying the development of osteoarthritis. The pathology in the older child shows that both soft tissues and bony parts are distorted to some degree. The acetabular index and center-edge (CE) angle evaluations are helpful in the initial evaluation and in the follow-up examinations. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be helpful in determining a reduction and distinguishing between dysplasia and subluxation. A controversy still exists as to the relative value of closed and open reduction in the treatment of a child who has reached walking age. For most surgeons, in a child up to three years of age, a careful closed reduction following a period of traction is the most useful form of treatment. The home traction program has been successful in this age group. For gentle closed reduction all maneuvers must be done as gently as possible and carried out as \"positioning\" the leg rather than forcing a reduction. The indications for open reduction are (1) if the femoral head persistently lies above the triradiate cartilage on roentgenographic examination, (2) if the arc of reduction and redislocation is less than 25 degrees after an adductor tenotomy, (3) if the femoral head will not enter the acetabulum, (4) if the femoral head is still laterally placed in the acetabulum after four weeks of partial reduction, and (5) if a previous reduction has failed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A range of pelvic and femoral osteotomies on both sides of the joint are required when there is marked deformity. The principles of management of the anatomic derangement of the painful adolescent hip are different from those in the younger child. Anatomic and biomechanical restoration at skeletal maturity must be perfect for the hip to function well in the long term. The plasticity and capacity for remodeling is much less than in the child. Postoperative immobilization must be avoided if joint stiffness is to be avoided. While the results of arthroplasty are the standard to which osteotomy must be compared, the high failure rate in young adults and pessimistic prospects of revision make biologic alternatives more attractive. The success of osteotomy depends on correct indications, careful preoperative planning, precise technique, rigid fixation, and early postoperative movement. When the indications for osteotomy cannot be met, arthrodesis is still the best solution for unilateral hip disease in patients younger than 30 years of age of either sex.\r"

This combination established a useful differential diagnosis of erythrocyte disorders. The data provided a baseline against which future studies of infants and children can be compared, though each laboratory has to verify its own normals. It should be cautioned that different electronic counters yield different RDW values, so there have to be qualifications when reporting reference values. The RDW may find its best use as a guide in the differential diagnosis of anemia, rather than as a definitive test per se.\r"

To determine whether the degree of elevation in FEP is useful in predicting which children with elevated blood lead levels have concomitant iron deficiency, 109 children suspected of having an elevated lead burden were studied. A complete blood count, reticulocyte count, FEP, lead, and ferritin were measured on each child. The effect of the independent variables, lead and iron status, both alone and in combination, on the dependent variable, FEP, was analyzed through a linear regression model. Lead status alone accounted for 42 percent of the explained variance in FEP, and the lead-iron interaction increased the explained variance by only an additional 1 percent. Screening for iron deficiency in children with elevated blood lead should continue to be based on dietary and socioeconomic risk factors and not on degree of elevation in FEP.\r"

The first part of the present article represents a longitudinal study of three subjects to assess the intraindividual variability of those caffeine metabolite ratios that are of potential interest for the determination of acetylator phenotypes. Effects of single and multiple doses, as well as of different periods of urine collection, were tested. A ratio relating the excretion of 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil to that of all products of the 7-demethylation pathway of paraxanthine proved to be highly reproducible, particularly after collection of overnight urine after coffee consumption during the day. This ratio showed complete concordance with the plasma index for sulfamethazine acetylation. The second part of this article showed the use of this ratio in a population study. It allowed a good separation of slow and fast acetylators and probably also a separation of homozygous and heterozygous fast acetylators.\r"

  ".W": "Kinetics and resting and exercise-induced hemodynamic and ECG effects of nicainoprol, a new antiarrhythmic structurally resembling propafenone or propranolol, were investigated in eight healthy male subjects receiving a 1-hour infusion (100 mg) and oral dose (200 mg) in a randomized-crossover fashion. Nicainoprol in plasma and urine was determined by a specific HPLC assay. Plasma concentration-time data were fitted to a triexponential equation. Mean postinfusion kinetic data were: alpha-phase half-life = 3.1 minutes, beta-phase half-life = 106.6 minutes, and gamma-phase half-life = 12.4 hours; volume of central compartment = 0.114 L/kg; steady-state volume of distribution = 0.67 L/kg; total clearance = 3.6 ml/min/kg; and renal clearance = 0.56 ml/min/kg. Absolute bioavailability was approximately 70% and peak plasma drug concentration occurred 2.3 hours after oral administration. Interindividual variability in AUC was 1.6- and 2.4-fold after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Cumulative fraction excreted unchanged in urine was approximately 15% and 9% of the dose after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Resting heart rates were increased, whereas exercise-induced heart rates were unchanged after both doses. QRS durations were widened after both doses. PR and QTc intervals were prolonged during intravenous study. The results suggest that nicainoprol is an enzyme-limited or poorly extracted drug suitable for both intravenous and oral administration and devoid of beta-blocking action in humans, at least with doses tested in this study. Its ECG properties appear to be similar to those of class I antiarrhythmics.\r"

In the first study, five subjects received oral doses of lamotrigine up to 240 mg. A linear relationship was observed between dose administration and both peak drug concentration and AUC. In a second study 10 subjects received 120 mg lamotrigine and the mean (+/- SD) of the elimination half-life (t1/2) was 24.1 +/- 5.7 hours and of volume of distribution/bioavailability 1.2 +/- 0.12 L/kg. Saliva concentrations were 46% of the plasma concentration. Total urinary recovery of drug over 144 hours was 70.5% of the oral dose. A glucuronide conjugate accounted for 89.4% of the urinary recovery. In a third study the kinetics of repeated administration were studied. Fifteen subjects were randomized to lamotrigine (n = 10) or placebo (n = 5) and received multiple doses over 7 days. The overall plasma elimination t1/2 calculated from data during the 7 days was 25.5 +/- 10.2 hours. Observed pharmacokinetics on multiple administration obeyed closely those predicted from the single-dose experiment, suggesting the absence of autoinduction of metabolism. No clinically important side effects or changes in central nervous system or cardiovascular system variables, hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis occurred during the 7 days.\r"

Sulindac pretreatment resulted in a 22% decrease in the mean cumulative sodium excretion after 3 hours (p less than 0.05) and a 21% decrease in the mean urine flow rate after 2 hours (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that sulindac has an effect on the kidney similar to that of other nonsteroidal agents.\r"

Previous studies of the effects of antidepressants on the dopamine and serotonin systems have focused on the two systems in isolation without considering the interactions between the two. One way of taking this interaction into account may be to form a ratio of dopamine and serotonin measures. The present study measured HVA and 5HIAA in cerebrospinal fluid of 31 patients with depression and 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease before and after treatment with a variety of antidepressant drugs. The ratio of HVA/5HIAA was able to discriminate much more powerfully between effects of different drugs than HVA or 5HIAA examined separately.\r"

The equilibrium time was about 3 1/2 hours. The AUC for total ketoprofen was greater in serum than in synovial fluid. On the other hand, the free fraction AUC in the serum and synovial fluid were quite similar. The mean residence time in the joint was about three times that in the systemic circulation. Ketoprofen was strongly bound to proteins and the percentage of free ketoprofen was not significantly different between serum and synovial fluid.

They are present in the diet and also derived from the enterobacterial metabolism of precursors such as choline. Dietary TMA is almost entirely metabolized to and excreted as TMAO. However, the extent to which TMA undergoes N-oxidation appears to be polymorphic in a British white population study (n = 169). Two propositi were identified with relative TMA N-oxidation deficiency that was further confirmed by oral challenge with TMA (600 mg). The study of the families of the two propositi, as well as those of two identified subjects with trimethylaminuria, under both normal dietary conditions and after oral TMA challenge strongly indicates that the conditions of impaired N-oxidation is inherited as a recessive trait. It is proposed that the N-oxidation of TMA in humans is polymorphic and under single gene diallelic control in which individuals who are homozygous for the variant allele exhibit marked N-oxidation deficiency and trimethylaminuria.\r"

We have carried out such studies using rabbit anti-THP antibodies as control reagents. 2. Urinary THP prepared by salt precipitation was used to prepare four immunoabsorbent columns by covalent coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. After washing with a variety of dissociating agents to remove any non-covalently bound subunit THP, each column was incubated with normal and immune rabbit serum. Fractions washed and eluted from columns were tested for anti-THP antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and THP antigen by radioimmunoassay, and showed NH4SCN (3 mol/l) and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) (6 mol/l) equivalent and sodium dodecyl sulphate (20 g/l) to be inferior in their capacity to produce immunoabsorbent THP capable of isolating specific antibodies from immune rabbit serum. 3. The column treated with GuHCl (6 mol/l) was used further in attempts to isolate putative anti-THP antibodies from five patients, who had a history of urinary tract infections and whose sera showed strong binding by ELISA. 4. Results from direct and inhibition ELISA experiments on fractions collected after washing and elution with all sera suggested that the putative human anti-THP antibodies were of very low affinity and/or directed against non-subunit THP. 5. The pathological relevance of human anti-THP antibodies measured by ELISA remains to be established.\r"

Numbers of leucocytes and platelets returned to pre-exercise levels within 24 h after the race. 2. The concentration of AA in plasma increased from 52.7 +/- 4.1 mumol/l before the race to 67.0 +/- 5.3 mumol/l within 5 min after the race (P less than 0.001). This increase in plasma AA concentration was positively correlated with the rise in plasma cortisol concentration during the race (r = 0.89; P less than 0.01). However, within 24 h after the race the plasma concentration of AA fell 20 +/- 4% below pre-exercise values (P less than 0.01) and remained low for at least the next 2 days (P less than 0.05). 3.

  ".W": "1. Platelets taken from healthy unmedicated subjects over 65 years of age display less inhibition of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) synthesis by noradrenaline than do platelets taken from young adults aged 18-25 years (P less than 0.03). The inhibition of cyclic AMP production by noradrenaline (10(-5) mol/l) correlates negatively with age over the range 18-92 years (r = -0.338, n = 108, P less than 0.005). The reduced cyclic AMP inhibition by noradrenaline in the elderly is not explained by basal cyclic AMP levels or degree of stimulation of platelets by PGE1, which do not differ between young and elderly subjects. The reduction itself is small, though, and cannot be demonstrated for a more potent agonist, adrenaline. 2. Despite the reduced noradrenaline response in the cyclic AMP system in the aged, platelet aggregation in response to alpha 2-adrenergic agents is normal or even slightly increased. Aggregation responses to adrenergic agents correlate well with aggregation responses to adenosine 5'-diphosphate, suggesting that the effector system is a major determinant of the aggregation response. 3. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor number measured by Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding of [3H]yohimbine to platelet membranes is comparable in young and old subjects, and does not correlate with age. The KD for [3H]yohimbine does not correlate with age. The IC50 for noradrenaline displacing [3H]yohimbine is comparable in young and elderly subjects. Therefore the reduced inhibition of cyclic AMP production by noradrenaline in platelets from elderly subjects is not explained by changes in alpha 2-adrenoceptor number, or agonist- or antagonist-binding properties, but may reside in the coupling of receptor to cyclase.\r"

During one subsequent 'high workload' test and one 'low workload' test they voluntarily copied their recorded breathing pattern. During a second 'low workload' test they breathed spontaneously. Isocapnia was maintained by the operator throughout both the copying tests. During the exercise tests ventilation was recorded and subjects indicated the level of their sensation of breathlessness every 30 s. 2. Subjects felt markedly less breathless when a proportion of their ventilation was produced by voluntary effort than when the same total level of ventilation was produced entirely by the stimulus of exercise. Furthermore, voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation during exercise did not increase breathlessness above that normally associated with that level of exercise. 3. These results suggest that it is reflexly driven ventilation, and not simply the level of ventilation itself, which relates to the level of breathlessness during exercise.\r"

Mean net K+ efflux (4 degrees C) was 108 nmol h-1 10(-9) erythrocytes, seven times greater than the mean for controls (15.2 nmol h-1 10(-9) erythrocytes). Net K+ efflux was not increased at 22 degrees C or 37 degrees C and losses at 4 degrees C were reversed by subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C. 2. Erythrocyte glucose consumption (4 degrees C) was 14 nmol h-1 10(-9) erythrocytes, similar to the mean for controls of 16.8 nmol h-1 10(-9) erythrocytes. This suggests that the increased net K+ efflux (4 degrees C) was not associated with abnormal energy consumption and was therefore unlikely to be due to an abnormality of the Na+, K+-pump. 3. Incubation of erythrocyte suspensions with ouabain (0.1 mmol/1) or frusemide (1 mmol/1) at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C resulted in no differences in K+ efflux between patient and controls. Incubation with quinine (2 mmol/1), an inhibitor of the erythrocyte Ca2+-dependent K+ channel, reduced net K+ efflux at 4 degrees C, but the effect persisted in Ca2+-depleted erythrocytes, implying that quinine was acting in a non-specific fashion. 4. Chemical pathologists and clinicians must be aware of this condition if inappropriate treatment of pseudohyperkalaemia is to be avoided.\r"

Chemical separation of different propolis samples and poplar bud extracts reveal that LB-1 is always present. Poplar bud secretion is the bee's major source for propolis and hence the origin of LB-1.

[14C]-PPDA (1% pet., USP) was placed in a variety of patch test systems at a concentration normalized to equal surface area (2 mg/mm2). Skin absorption was determined in the guinea pig by urinary excretion of 14C. There was a six-fold difference in the range of skin absorption (p less than 0.02). In decreasing order, % skin absorption from the systems were Hill Top Chamber (53.4 +/- 20.6) greater than Teflon Control patch (48.6 +/- 9.3) greater than Small Finn Chamber with paper disc insert (34.1 +/- 19.8) greater than Small Finn Chamber (29.8 +/- 9.0) greater than Large Finn Chamber (23.1 +/- 7.3) greater than AL-Test Chamber (8.0 +/- 0.8).

The erythrocyte Mg assessment was particularly useful for the high frequency of abnormalities observed, because it was less affected than plasma Mg by such transitory clinical states as hemodilution or lipolysis. The erythrocyte K was less frequently altered; no patient with a high K deficit was studied, excluding one patient with Crohn's disease.

Mean heart rate fell from 114 +/- 10 to 45 +/- 5 beat/min with suctioning after the saline aerosol (p less than .001). Both nebulized and parenteral atropine sulfate prevented the bradycardic response in all six subjects (p less than .001). After nebulized saline, three patients also experienced a greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg fall in systolic BP. Both nebulized and parenteral atropine prevented the hypotensive response. Tachycardia occurred after parenteral atropine in all six patients, while only one episode of tachycardia was seen after nebulized atropine. Both parenteral and nebulized atropine can prevent bradycardia and hypotension elicited by endotracheal suctioning, but nebulized atropine may have a wider margin of safety at the doses used in this study.\r"

Important factors contributing to ARF in TB patients included Gram-negative pneumonia and/or sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior TB with anti-TB medication noncompliance, and malignancy. Six patients were not suspected of having TB when admitted to the medical ICU; three patients who had not been treated for TB were found to have TB on autopsy. The inhospital mortality rate for all patients with TB requiring intensive care was 67%, but was 81% in those with ARF.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that an increased pulmonary arterial systolic storage volume (PASSV) correlates with a significant redistribution of pulmonary perfusion was examined in 30 surgical patients. Right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) was used as an index of distribution of pulmonary perfusion. The systolic storage volume was calculated from the pulmonary arterial compliance and mean pulmonary arterial distending pressure. Pulmonary arteriolar pressures were computed by Fourier analysis. Pulmonary arterial compliance was derived from the pulmonary arterial time constant and pulmonary arterial resistance. There was a linear relationship between PASSV and RVSWI (r = .81, p less than .001). Also, a direct correlation was found between RVSWI and pulmonary arterial time constant (r = .45, p less than .01). When the patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of pre-existing disease, linear relationships between PASSV and RVSWI were present in all groups, and the slopes were not different among the three groups. The patients were also divided into two groups based on a storage volume fraction of stroke volume index, to evaluate the effect of other hemodynamic data on the PASSV. Comparison of the two groups revealed that pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial compliance were significantly higher in the group with a high storage volume fraction (p = .05 and p = .01, respectively). RVSWI and time constant were also significantly different between the groups (p less than .01 and p less than .01, respectively). We conclude that the pressure work generated by the right ventricle improved the distribution of pulmonary perfusion by increasing PASSV.\r"

These changes reflect that the mean PsqO2 is approximately 10 torr below the PO2 of venous blood draining that tissue. Since PaO2 was already known, the oxygen content of arterial and venous blood entering and leaving this tissue could be determined by reference to blood-oxygen dissociation curves. Therefore, relative changes in blood flow could be calculated using the Fick principle. After a 20% blood loss, the PsqO2 measured during breathing of room air fell to 20% of baseline, corresponding to an 80% fall in sc blood flow; it remained low until the shed blood was returned despite compensatory changes in cardiac output. Rapid infusion of electrolyte solutions in normovolemic animals produced a temporary increase in local blood flow. Subcutaneous oximetry seems capable of quantifying peripheral perfusion and may be clinically useful.\r"

Although the hemodynamic conditions during cardiac compression were not significantly different after both routes of drug administration, endobronchial instillation produced a prolonged drug action during the first hour of restored spontaneous circulation. A more extensive use of this type of drug administration, especially in out-of-hospital resuscitation, is suggested.\r"

Dobutamine decreased the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), without significant changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Dopamine increased MAP, SVR, and PVR, except for a decrease at 10 micrograms/kg.min. Both drugs produced dose-related increases in cardiac output and venous admixture; however, with dopamine the dose-response curve reached a plateau at doses greater than 40 micrograms/kg.min. While the oxygen consumption (VO2) increased progressively in both groups, the oxygen availability ratio (DO2/VO2) and arteriovenous oxygen content difference (CaO2 - CvO2) were maintained mainly by increased cardiac output in the dobutamine group and hemoglobin concentration in the dopamine group. Thirty minutes after termination of drug infusions, the DO2/VO2 dropped, and CaO2 - CvO2 increased significantly in both groups. These changes were mainly due to sustained high VO2; however, in the dopamine group, a larger imbalance resulted from further decreases in cardiac output to levels below the control value.\r"

These patients were placed on an open trial of ribavirin therapy. We describe a technique for the safe delivery of aerosolized ribavirin to these infants while on the ventilator. The agent was delivered for 16 h/day for 7 days. Modifications of the ventilator circuit were needed to prevent the condensation of the drug in the ventilator tubing and to allow for the safe and effective operation of the ventilator. A common ventilator strategy was used for all patients. The highest positive inspiratory pressure generated was 42 +/- 9.5 (SD) cm H2O, the highest PEEP was 5.9 +/- 3.2 cm H2O, the duration of ventilation was 10.7 +/- 8.5 days, and exposure to fraction of inspired oxygen was greater than or equal to 0.6 for 55.3 h. Ribavirin levels were measurable in two patients, thereby demonstrating that the drug was in fact delivered and absorbed. Our preliminary results demonstrate that ribavirin can be delivered to the patients with respiratory syncytial viral infections who require mechanical ventilation; however, further studies are indicated to evaluate the efficacy and dose responsiveness, alterations in pulmonary dynamics, and safety of ribavirin in delivery to infants requiring ventilation.\r"

We compared this relationship with that between Qsp/Qt and its commonly used estimates: inspired oxygen concentration to arterial blood oxygen tension ratio, arterial to alveolar oxygen tension ratio, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference. The relationship between Qsp/Qt and the oxygen tension-based indices is nonlinear and substantially influenced by changes in inspired oxygen concentration and arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Therefore, it is inaccurate within the clinically acceptable range of arterial blood oxygenation. In contrast, calculation of ventilation-perfusion index from arterial and mixed venous blood oxyhemoglobin saturations provides a linear estimate of Qsp/Qt that is minimally affected by alterations in inspired oxygen concentration or oxygen uptake and, therefore, will allow accurate continuous assessment of pulmonary gas exchange.\r"

Excellent correlation by linear regression (n = 108, r = .95) was observed between the two methods at oxygen saturations ranging from 35% to 95%.

Oxygen consumption and CO2 production showed a marked increase during the first 6 h postoperatively. Consequently, the measured resting energy expenditure was markedly elevated compared to the predicted energy expenditure. This hypermetabolic response occurred simultaneously with maximum spontaneous rewarming after the end of surgical procedures. Ventricular function was low throughout the postoperative period, and no cardiac response to increased energy requirements was recorded. On the contrary, marked increases in arteriovenous oxygen and CO2 difference were observed during the period of highest resting energy expenditure. We conclude that the first hours after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass represent the period of highest risk for decompensation. The continuous monitoring of CO2 production is suggested as a useful clinical method to detect postoperative changes in metabolic rate.\r"

Prolonged hyperinflations to 40 cm H2O can completely reverse deterioration of gas exchange and compliance in such patients. Similar efforts have effectively recruited atelectatic lung regions in critically ill patients. Less aggressive hyperinflations have not improved lung function in patients with abnormal lungs with hypoxemia. However, sustained exaggerated hyperinflations may successfully open collapsed lung units in these patients when standard recruitment techniques fail. We compared periodic hyperinflations of 40 cm H2O lasting 15 to 30 sec associated with body positioning (directed recruitment [DR]) to standard bag-sigh-suctioning (BSS) for their effects on gas exchange and pulmonary compliance in 16 stable surgical ICU patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure of 24-h duration or longer. Patients were sequentially alternated between DR and BSS (group 1, BSS followed by DR; group 2, DR followed by BSS). Neither technique, alone or in sequence, resulted in a sustained (greater than or equal to 5 min) improvement or deterioration in either gas exchange or pulmonary compliance. We conclude that neither BSS nor DR reliably affects gas exchange or compliance in patients with established hypoxemic respiratory failure.\r"

However, the mechanism(s) behind Fn depletion in sepsis are obscure. We measured the Fn plasma concentration in 32 patients 12 to 24 h after the diagnosis of septic shock. Although the average plasma level was low (214 +/- 80 [SD] mg/L) compared to that of a reference material (p less than .001), the range was great (60 to 403 mg/L). A multivariate analysis of some possible influencing factors showed significant (p less than .01) positive correlations to the prothrombin level (r = .62) and the amount of insulin infused per 24 h (r = .63). The relationships to disseminated intravascular coagulation-related variables, hemodilution, and outcome were weak. Cryoprecipitate was infused into 16 patients; Fn levels increased by 52 +/- 18% of the expected increase. The most severely ill patients displayed the lowest rates of increase. The postinfusion decrease in Fn plasma concentration indicated that the plasma half-life of cryoprecipitate Fn was about 25 h. The results support the concept that decreased Fn synthesis, probably in the liver, is the major reason for Fn depletion in sepsis, rather than an increased rate of consumption.\r"

We sought to determine the frequency of metabolic acidosis in such patients and to assess the relative contributions of renal bicarbonate loss and lactic acid accumulation to this acidosis. Twenty-two asthmatics (21-71 yr; four males, and 18 females) who came consecutively to the emergency department with severe acute asthma were studied. Most patients reported that their asthmatic symptoms had begun to worsen greater than or equal to 2 days before the emergency department visit. Within several hours, simultaneous measurements of arterial blood gases, whole blood lactate, and serum electrolytes were made. Ten of 22 patients were found to have metabolic acidosis (base deficit greater than 2 mEq/L). All ten patients had nonanion gap acidosis, while nine of ten had whole blood lactate values in the normal range (0.33 to 2.55 mmol/L). In the one patient with an elevated whole blood lactate level, the concentration of lactate in excess of normal (0.45 mmol/L) could not account for the magnitude of the base deficit (-4.9 mEq/L). We conclude that a) nonanion gap metabolic acidosis is very common in asthmatics with acute severe asthma (prevalence 45% in our series), and b) the mechanism of the base deficit in these patients is excessive renal bicarbonate excretion. We believe that the latter occurs as a renal compensatory response to a preceding period of hypocapnia due to hyperventilation related to worsening asthma.\r"

We simultaneously measured oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and on arterial blood samples by co-oximetry as well as PaO2 and the relative content of fetal (F) and adult hemoglobin in order to evaluate the reliability of pulse oximetry. Comparisons were made in triplicate in ten infants with acute cardiorespiratory disease less than 7 days of age and in 11 infants with chronic lung disease greater than 28 days of age. Oxygen saturation pulse oximetry and arterial saturation were well correlated over a wide range of saturation values. In infants with chronic lung disease, PO2 derived from pulse oximetry was within 10 torr of measured PaO2 in 73% of comparisons. In contrast, calculated PaO2 was within 10 torr of measured PaO2 in only 50% of comparisons in patients with acute disorders. The chronic infants all had less than 10% hemoglobin F, but in the acute infants, hemoglobin F ranged from 26% to 83%. Nonetheless, correction of oxygen dissociation curves for type of hemoglobin in these acute infants failed to improve the correlation between calculated and measured PaO2. We conclude that pulse oximetry saturations and their derived PaO2 values correlated well with measured arterial saturation and PaO2 obtained from arterial blood samples in neonates with chronic lung disease and prolonged oxygen dependence. In infants with acute cardiorespiratory problems, pulse oximetry unreliably reflects PaO2, but may be useful in detecting clinical deterioration.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 3-yr period (1982 to 1984), 533 arterial catheters were inserted in 476 patients admitted to the pediatric ICU or the operating room. Radial arterial catheterization with small-bore, 0.8-mm, 22-ga Teflon cannulas was the most common method (376 of 533 cannulations), and 296 of these catheters were inserted in patients less than 1 yr of age. All catheters were flushed intermittently with heparin (12.5 U/ml) in isotonic saline. The mean catheter duration was 2.6 days, and only minor complications were noted. The main reason for catheter removal was malfunction of the arterial line. There was no difference in duration or complication rate between catheters inserted percutaneously or by cutdown. Over a 6-month period (1985 to 1986), 42 0.8-mm, 22-ga radial arterial catheters were inserted in 39 patients less than 1 yr of age; all catheters were maintained by a continuous flushing system using heparin (5 U/ml) in isotonic saline. The mean duration was 6.3 days. No complications were noted, and the proportion of catheter malfunction decreased. This study confirms the safety of radial arterial catheterization in children and neonates. The continuous flushing system considerably improved catheter patency compared to a method using intermittent flushing.\r"

Two sets of mongrel dogs were studied: uninjured (n = 25; 14 to 22 kg) and pulmonary fibrin-microembolized (n = 25; 15 to 23 kg). In both sets of experiments, left atrial pressure was controlled (15 mm Hg) throughout the 4-h plus experimental period. In the uninjured set, the Pc-pi c gradient averaged +1.0 and -0.2 mm Hg in the hydroxyethyl starch and dextran groups, +0.7 and +2.3 mm Hg in the human serum albumin and control groups, and +6.2 mm Hg in the Ringer's lactate group. In the fibrin-microembolized group, this gradient averaged 2.6, 2.4, 3.0, 5.3, and 9.5, respectively. The extravascular lung water to bloodless dry lung wet weight ratios in the no-fluid treatment group of the uninjured and microembolism groups with increased pressure (3.8 +/- 0.3 to 4.1 +/- 0.4 [SEM]; NS) are consistent with interstitial or perivascular edema. There were, however, no significant differences noted between the respective control groups or any fluid treatment group in either set of experiments. These data support the view that infusion of either colloid or crystalloid solutions in normal or pulmonary fibrin-microembolized lungs does not produce sufficient change in the Pc-pi c gradient to elevate edemagenesis when pulmonary capillary pressure is limited to 22 mm Hg in dogs.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that small volume infusions of 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran-70 (HSD) are superior to equal volumes of normal saline (NS) or 7.5% NaCl in the ability to resuscitate animals from an otherwise lethal hemorrhage. In the present experiment, we evaluated organ blood flow in unanesthetized swine bled 46 ml/kg in 15 min and subsequently infused with a volume of HSD (n = 5) or NS (n = 5) equal to 25% of the shed blood. Radiomicrospheres were injected before hemorrhage, immediately after hemorrhage, and 5 and 30 min after treatment. At the end of hemorrhage, cardiac output had fallen to one-third of baseline values. Five minutes after the infusion of HSD, cardiac output had returned to baseline levels, while cardiac output in the NS-treated controls had increased to only one-half of prehemorrhage values. Blood flows to the brain, diaphragm, skin, muscle, and fat were not different between the two groups. Infusion with HSD, however, produced flows to the myocardium, kidneys, liver, small intestine, and pancreas that were significantly greater than post-hemorrhage and NS-treated control values. NS was unable to increase these flows significantly above post-hemorrhage levels. We conclude that small volumes of HSD can significantly improve organ blood flow after hemorrhagic shock. This improvement in flow may explain the increased survival observed with this solution and may attenuate some of the later complications of hemorrhagic shock.\r"

Throughout the range of IAP studied (10 +/- 5 to 70 +/- 10 mm Hg), bladder pressure did not differ significantly from the direct measurement of IAP. We conclude that the measurement of bladder pressure using a standard transurethral bladder catheter provides an accurate determination of IAP.\r"

Fifteen smokers rated puffs from their own brand of cigarette, citric acid aerosol, a low tar and nicotine cigarette, and air. To focus on tracheal perceptions and pharmacologic effects of nicotine, we equated visual, olfactory and taste cues across conditions. Subjects rated the citric acid aerosol more similar to their own brand, more desirable, and more satisfying (after a block of puffs) than control puffs of air. It was also rated equal to or better than the low tar and nicotine cigarette. Subjects' own brands were rated best, although puffs of citric acid aerosol were of comparable strength and harshness. The results suggest that a nebulizer delivering citric acid in a fine mist might reduce craving for cigarettes in smokers attempting to quit and may thereby increase cessation rates.\r"

Their smoking habits were routinely analyzed. The sample consisted of 15,204 persons domiciled in the same circumscribed area (County of Stockholm). The annual incidence of first SP in the admission area is 6/100,000 for women and 18/100,000 for men. The study showed that smoking increased the relative risk of contracting a first spontaneous pneumothorax approximately ninefold among women and 22-fold among men and that there is a striking, statistically significant (p less than 0.001) dose-response relationship between smoking and the occurrence of SP. The life span risk of contracting SP among lifelong heavily smoking men is roughly estimated to be 12 percent but only 1/1,000 among never smokers.\r"

Two potential problems with an indwelling pericardial catheter system are catheter blockage and infection. We have utilized slow infusion of heparinized saline solution (3 ml/hr) via a continuous flush device to maintain catheter patency for up to seven days (mean 3.6) in 16 patients. Pericardial effusions were secondary to malignancy, uremia, and cardiac surgery. This article describes practical aspects of the technique. Most pericardial effusions can be successfully treated with pericardiocentesis and catheter drainage, provided the drainage is continued reliably and safely for several days. Surgical treatment such as subxiphoid pericardiostomy or partial pericardiectomy should be reserved for loculated effusions, clotted blood, subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or significant recurrences after initial drainage.\r"

We calculated the cytotoxicity activity and lytic unit (LU) of natural killer (NK) cells. Significant impairment was noted in the comparison of NK cytotoxicity and LU between stage III-M1 lung CA patients (n = 28) and the control group. However, significant impairment was also noted in stage III-M1 and III-M0 patients. Four cases in stage I underwent surgery, and the NK cytotoxicity before the operation was noted to be low. After the operation, the NK cytotoxicity increased. These results indicate that NK cytotoxicity assay was impaired in stage III-M1 lung CA and also suggest that it may act as a therapeutic guide in determining the results of the operation.\r"

We observed six normal subjects, six patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis, and six patients with asymptomatic bronchial asthma (three men and three women in each group), all of whom had normal pulmonary function. At rest, five of the six normal subjects breathed nasally but 11 of the 12 patients breathed with an oronasal distribution. Five normal subjects who breathed nasally at rest breathed with an oronasal distribution of ventilation during exercise, and one normal subject who breathed oronasally at rest had slightly less oral ventilation during exercise. In the patients, the change in oral distribution of ventilation during exercise was variable. Among the three groups, there were no significant differences from the resting oronasal distribution for ventilation during exercise, and all subjects breathed oronasally during exercise. The oronasal distribution of ventilation did not correlate with the level of nasal airflow resistance. Analysis of the timing, volume, and flow components of breathing showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups at rest and exercise. Thus, neither the level of resistance to nasal airflow, even up to moderately high values, nor the nasal distribution of ventilation at rest and with moderate exercise appears to have a major role in the pattern of breathing.\r"

Inter-machine variability was an important contributor to intra-subject variability for tcPO2. The percentage change from baseline required to detect a significant physiologic change while breathing room air was 1.2 percent for SaO2 and 13.8 percent for tcPO2. When subjects breathed a 15 percent oxygen mixture, the percentage change for significance increased to a maximum of 4.7 percent for SaO2 and 35.8 percent for tcPO2. These results are applicable to non-neonatal pediatric and adult patients and demonstrate the importance of intra-subject variability when performing noninvasive measurements of patient oxygenation over time.\r"

We studied seven men and measured alae nasi (AN) and genioglossal (GG) electromyograms (EMGs) during two nights of sleep, one with their nose open and the other with their nose occluded. Nasal occlusion produced OSA in all subjects and also increased the percentage of time during sleep in which phasic AN and GG EMG activity was present. Apneas tended to occur at the nadirs of EMG activity. This suggests that nasal occlusion generally increases respiratory drive to upper airway muscles during sleep and that it does not cause OSA by merely decreasing respiratory drive to these muscles.\r"

Our report confirms and extends that observation. Review of 42 successive pneumonectomies revealed one case of bronchopleural fistula with the use of the standard reusable parallel firing stapling device; there were six cases of bronchopleural fistulas in 36 successive pneumonectomies performed with the modified hinged stapling device (four with reusable and two with disposable instruments). Improperly formed staples were identified by x-ray examination or reoperation. We recommend that only the standard reusable parallel firing stapling devices be used for bronchial closure in pneumonectomy.\r"

One of these patients died of progressive respiratory insufficiency and the others are clinically disabled. Their symptoms and airflow obstruction are more severe than those of most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these individuals, we cannot say that precocious obstructive lung disease is not due to a combination of smoking and other factors, nor can we be certain that methylphenidate is the offending agent. However, this cluster of cases among methylphenidate abusers suggests that long-term IV exposure to this drug might lead to early severe obstructive lung disease.\r"

We investigated whether ibuprofen, administered after acute lung injury, would result in improvement in arterial oxygenation. In animals not receiving ibuprofen after unilateral acute lung injury with ECV, PaO2 decreased and venous admixture increased significantly from control values at all experimental time-periods. In those animals receiving ibuprofen, significant decreases in venous admixture were noted. The decrease in PaO2 after ECV administration was significantly less than that observed in animals that did not receive ibuprofen after acute lung injury (p less than 0.05). Ibuprofen had no effect on extravascular lung water. These results demonstrate that in an ECV model of acute lung injury the administration of ibuprofen, after the acute lung injury, results in significant decreases in venous admixture.\r"

Sequential electrocardiograms and cardiac isoenzyme levels following coronary angioplasty were within normal limits. Thus, severe myocardial ischemia following intravenous dipyridamole testing can occur and emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of these patients, particularly when the pretest risk of coronary disease is high.\r"
