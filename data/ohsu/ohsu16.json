  ".W": "Although ambulatory ECG recordings provide quantitative information in the follow-up of patients with ventricular arrhythmias, they are performed infrequently, potentially missing serious arrhythmias in the unmonitored periods. Telephone ECG systems offer \"real-time\" ECG information, theoretically functioning as an arrhythmia surveillance system. Thus we incorporated frequent telephone ECG transmissions in two antiarrhythmic drug protocols. The first investigation was designed to show the relationship of telephone and ambulatory ECGs in patients with frequent ventricular tachycardia (VT). The second protocol selected patients with \"nonlife-threatening\" frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in whom a second placebo period was instituted to simulate the clinical situation of asymptomatic arrhythmia increase. In both drug trials there was a strong linear relationship between the log-transformed PVC counts of telephone ECG and concomitant PVC, couplet, and VT frequencies on ambulatory ECG. In the VT population, greater than or equal to 1 PVC on telephone ECG reflected the presence of VT on ambulatory ECG (sensitivity 87%; specificity 77%). In the second study, telephone ECG transmissions with PVCs on three consecutive transmissions reflected the change from less than or equal to 10 PVCs/hour to greater than or equal to 40 PVCs/hour on ambulatory ECG within 48 hours. These data support the concept that daily surveillance by means of telephone ECG provides arrhythmia information of qualitative clinical relevance.\r"

No significant relationship was found between gender or blood pressure and aortic or PA flow velocity measurements. Aortic peak flow velocity, flow velocity integral, and average acceleration decreased with increasing age (all p less than 0.001), whereas ejection time (corrected for heart rate) increased, and acceleration time did not change. In contrast, there was no relationship between age and Doppler PA flow velocity measurements. Although there was no relationship between BSA and Doppler aortic flow measurements, PA peak flow velocity and average acceleration increased, while acceleration time decreased with increasing BSA (all p less than 0.02). Decreases in aortic peak flow velocity and flow velocity integral may be partly related to known increases in aortic root diameter with aging. The relationship between PA flow velocity measurements and BSA is not readily explained.\r"

Systolic wall thickening was reduced from 26.47 +/- 6.20% (S.D.) (control) to 22.05 +/- 5.73% (mild stenosis), 17.00 +/- 5.86% (moderate stenosis), 11.46 +/- 3.56% (severe stenosis), and 3.69 +/- 2.57% (30-second occlusion), values significantly different from each other (p less than 0.01). The amplitude of the first harmonic decreased stepwise from 1.35 +/- 0.31 to 1.08 +/- 0.29 mm, 0.90 +/- 0.27 mm, 0.69 +/- 0.24 mm, and 0.43 +/- 0.12 mm, all significantly different from each other (p less than 0.05). These amplitude values correlated to percent systolic wall thickening (r = 0.894, p = 0.001). A phase shift of the first harmonic from 137 +/- 11 to 139 +/- 14 degrees, 150 +/- 15 degrees (p less than 0.05 vs control), 161 +/- 21 degrees (p less than 0.01 vs control), and 191 +/- 21 degrees (p less than 0.01 vs control and severe stenosis) correlated with the increase in time from end diastole to the point of maximum wall excursion (r = 0.662, p less than 0.001). These data indicate that the extent of ischemic regional myocardial hypokinesis can be adequately described by the amplitude of the first harmonic, and that the asynchrony of ventricular contraction and relaxation can be detected from the phase of the first harmonic.\r"

Thus, in 30 dogs, 1 minute after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, 99mTc-labeled albumin microspheres (8 mCi) were injected into the left atrium for subsequent assessment of the hypoperfused zone, that is, the area at risk of infarction. Fifteen minutes after coronary artery occlusion, dogs were randomized into a control group (n = 15) and a cytochrome C-treated group (n = 15). The latter immediately received cytochrome C, 2.5 mg/kg intravenously. Six hours after coronary artery occlusion the dogs were sacrificed and their left ventricles were cut into 3 mm thick slices. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and measured by planimetry. The same slices were then submitted to autoradiography and the hypoperfused zone was then measured by planimetry. The hypoperfused zone was 22 +/- 2% and 23 +/- 2% of the left ventricle in the control and treated groups, respectively (NS), indicating that the extent of myocardium at risk before treatment was similar. The extent of the hypoperfused zone which evolved to necrosis was 90 +/- 3% in the control group but only 50 +/- 7% in the treated group (p less than 0.001). Myocardial salvage in the treated group was paralleled by improvement in systolic wall thickness of the ischemic segment as measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Thus, cytochrome C reduced the extent of myocardial necrosis by 44% and improved systolic function of the ischemic myocardium.\r"

These hemodynamic responses were accompanied by notable declines in systemic vascular resistance (-28%, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary arteriolar resistance (-24%, p less than 0.05). These effects persisted throughout the 24-hour period of observation. The decline in left ventricular filling pressure in our patients ranged in magnitude from 8 to 21 mm Hg, and varied linearly and directly with pretreatment values for left ventricular filling pressure (r = 0.69). The decrease in systemic vascular resistance ranged in magnitude from 3% to 40% and varied linearly and directly with pretreatment values for systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.85). These data indicate that BTS 49465, a new oral, direct-acting vasodilator agent, exerts balanced cardiocirculatory effects in patients with severe chronic heart failure, which may be sustained with once-daily oral administration.\r"

Ages ranged from 2 to 13 months (6.7 +/- 4.0 months, mean +/- SD). Each infant had congestive heart failure and angiographic evidence of markedly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (0.24 +/- 0.11; normal = 0.58-0.78) with left ventricular dilation (left ventricular end-diastolic volume = 349 +/- 125% of normal). Hydralazine (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg administered intravenously) acutely decreased systemic arteriolar resistance from 21.1 +/- 3.3 to 12.0 +/- 2.7 U/m2 (p less than 0.001). This 41 +/- 14% decrease in systemic resistance was accompanied by a 45 +/- 16% increase in cardiac index (3.24 +/- 0.53 to 4.71 +/- 0.99 L/min/m2; p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure declined from 70 +/- 8 to 60 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Hydralazine also increased heart rate (122 +/- 19 to 138 +/- 18 bpm; p less than 0.001), but this increase did not account entirely for the change in cardiac index as evidenced by a rise in stroke volume index (26.9 +/- 4.9 to 34.5 +/- 7.5 ml/beat/m2; p less than 0.001). Pulmonary arteriolar resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure fell slightly in response to hydralazine. Subsequently, oral hydralazine was included in the treatment regimen of 10 infants followed for 3 to 38 months (mean = 15 months). Of these, eight demonstrated sustained clinical improvement. We conclude that hydralazine may be a beneficial adjunct to the management of congestive heart failure in young infants with a dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

Plasma BTG in the hypertensive group correlated significantly with the total serum cholesterol concentration (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01) and with the atherogenic cholesterol fractions low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01). In the normotensive group, no significant correlation was observed between plasma BTG and total serum cholesterol (r = 0.14) or between plasma BTG and LDL + VLDL cholesterol (r = 0.08). Neither was any significant correlation found between plasma BTG and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or total triglycerides in either group. Thus, middle-aged men with untreated essential hypertension have an increased blood platelet release reaction related to their concentrations of atherogenic blood lipids. This relationship may be of pathogenetic importance for atherogenesis in hypertension.\r"

However, eight patients (40%) demonstrated no change or an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance. Six of these eight patients had an average daytime mean pressure above 120 mm Hg. There was a significant decrease in the index of resistance during exercise in all but one of the 16 subjects. Hemodynamic parameters of 1 hour before and 1 hour after awakening were similar to the values obtained during the entire night and the rest of the day, respectively.

  ".W": "Right ventricular myocardial infarction has been reported to occur exclusively in association with inferior left ventricular infarction. To determine the frequency of right ventricular myocardial infarction in association with anterior left ventricular myocardial infarction, all hearts with anterior myocardial infarction studied over a 3-year period were examined for evidence of right ventricular necrosis or scar. Of 97 hearts with anterior myocardial infarction, 13 (13%) had anterior right ventricular myocardial infarction. The right ventricular infarcts involved from 10% to 50% (mean 28%) of the circumference of the right ventricular free wall from base to apex. The associated left ventricular infarcts were all anteroseptal and large and involved from 36% to 67% (mean 50%) of the total area of the left ventricular free wall and septum. Nine of the 13 patients underwent equilibrium radionuclide angiography and six had demonstrable right ventricular regional and global dysfunction. Thus, right ventricular myocardial infarction does occur with anterior wall left ventricular infarction, and right ventricular dysfunction may be demonstrable by radionuclide angiography. Further investigation is needed to define the hemodynamic characteristics, clinical importance, and therapeutic implications of anterior right ventricular myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the ability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging to assess left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF), we studied 24 patients within 48 hours of single-plane LV angiography. In all patients, a transverse, single-plane NMR acquisition technique was employed with LV end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) volumes (V) calculated by a modified area-length algorithm. In nine patients, a multislice acquisition technique was employed with LVEDV and LVESV calculated by a Simpson's rule algorithm. NMR-determined LVV and EF correlated reasonably well with angiographic values (LVEDV: r = 0.75; LVESV: r = 0.90; and LVEF: r = 0.76). The single-plane NMR technique significantly underestimated LVEDV (p less than 0.01), whereas no significant difference was demonstrated for LVESV. As a result, angiographic LVEF was significantly underestimated (p less than 0.05). This underestimation is likely related to off-axis imaging and to the geometric constraints of a single-plane algorithm. In comparing multislice NMR to angiographic data, no significant difference was demonstrated for LVEDV, LVESV, or LVEF. Thus, quantitation of LVV and EF with NMR is feasible, and comparison to angiographic volumes is similar to results reported from other noninvasive imaging modalities. Improvement in current acquisition techniques and software should result in further quantitative potential.\r"

We studied LP in 152 patients without a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia who underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring for varying clinical indications (chest pain 21%, syncope 17%, palpitations 32%, dizziness 20%, other 10%). Twenty-one patients (14%) had a positive test. Of the 152 patients, 84 (55%) had complex ventricular arrhythmias and 68 (45%) had simple or no ventricular arrhythmias. Complex ventricular arrhythmias were present in 71% of patients with and in 52% of those without LP. In conclusion: patients without history of sustained ventricular tachycardia who demonstrate complex nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias on Holter monitoring have a low prevalence of LP; the presence of LP on signal-averaged ECG indicates an electrical property of the heart, which is distinct from complex ventricular arrhythmias detected on Holter monitoring.\r"

A No. 4.5 French single lumen catheter, with steerable guidewire and an optical fiber, was introduced through a Judkins-type femoral-coronary guiding catheter into three left anterior descending and eight left circumflex coronary arteries. A total of 65 laser energy exposures were made coaxially at 24 sites in the 11 arteries. At five sites, angiographically evident arterial perforation occurred with the first laser exposure, while at seven sites multiple laser exposures were made without angiographically evident perforation. All eight dogs remained hemodynamically stable, and were electively killed 5 +/- 1 hours following the procedure. Sections of myocardium from territories supplied by treated arteries demonstrated minimal or no pathology in 10 cases, while one territory had a small zone of early myocardial necrosis. This study suggests that standard coronary artery catheterization techniques can be used to introduce and position a steerable guidewire and an optical fiber in canine coronary arteries. Laser energy can repeatedly be delivered coaxially. Short-term deleterious effects may be reduced or eliminated, and exposure of blood elements to argon laser energy does not appear to create debris.\r"

All patients underwent control EP studies followed by continuous telemetric cardiac monitoring during oral amiodarone administration (mean duration 29 +/- 6 days, mean dose 739 +/- 230 mg). Follow-up 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring and EP studies were performed. Thirty VT recurrences occurred in the first 4 weeks of amiodarone therapy (total incidence, 61%), with the majority (55%) in the first 3 weeks of treatment. During long-term follow-up (1 to 42, mean 15 +/- 12 months), there were 12 symptomatic VT/VF recurrences (incidence 24%). There was a higher incidence of VT recurrences if patients had inducible sustained or nonsustained VT at chronic EP study (p less than 0.01), or complex ventricular arrhythmias on ambulatory ECG monitoring (p less than 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of chronic EP testing and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring were 100%, 35%, and 51%, and 58%, 84%, and 78%, respectively. Chronic EP testing correctly identified all patients who had their arrhythmia suppressed by amiodarone on long-term follow-up, while 42% of all VT recurrences occurred in patients without complex ventricular arrhythmias on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, 26 patients with symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation were evaluated by PVS by means of one to three extrastimuli (ES) before treatment and after 2 months of amiodarone therapy. Before amiodarone, sustained unimorphic VT was induced in 21 patients (group A) and symptomatic, nonsustained VT was induced in five patients (group B). After 65 +/- 8 days of amiodarone (total dose 64.5 +/- 8.9 gm, mean +/- S.D.), 15 of 21 patients (71%) in group A had sustained VT, five patients (24%) had nonsustained VT, and one patient had no VT induced. Four of five patients (80%) in group B had sustained VT and one patient had no VT induced. VT was induced by the same or by fewer number of ES in 79% of cases. When the morphologies of the VT induced before and after amiodarone were compared, the morphology of VT induced after amiodarone was the same in only 8 of 24 patients (33%), unimorphic but different in 14 patients (58%), and polymorphic in the remaining two patients. No correlation was found between the serum concentrations of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, tetraiodothyronine, triiodothyronine, or reverse triiodothyronine, and similarities or differences in VT morphology, VT cycle length, or the relative number of ES required to induce VT after treatment with amiodarone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed in nine men and six women with a mean age of 68 +/- 2 years and a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 41 +/- 4%. All patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation while off all antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients were then tested on procainamide, 1000 mg, administered intravenously, and ventricular tachycardia could be provoked in 10 of 15 patients. Indecainide was given intravenously, 1 mg/kg. Indecainide did not significantly change the baseline heart rate, blood pressure, and QTc interval from control values. The PR and QRS intervals were significantly prolonged. Twelve of 15 patients were still inducible for ventricular tachycardia on indecainide. Procainamide protected 5 of 15 patients against ventricular tachycardia induction. In patients still inducible on indecainide therapy, the ventricular tachycardia rate was significantly slowed, from 281 bpm to 224 bpm on indecainide and to 215 bpm on procainamide. The effects of this new class IC antiarrhythmic agent appears similar to procainamide in patients with serious life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional assessment of the energy required for successful ventricular defibrillation involves the measurement of a \"defibrillation threshold\" (DFT), implying a clear-cut distinction between effective and ineffective energies. We examined the relationship between delivered energy and the likelihood of successful defibrillation in 10 open-chest pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, with the use of an internal spring/patch electrode system. An initial DFT was determined by decreasing the energy discharged until a failure first occurred (10.3 +/- 3.4 J). Six energy levels in 1 to 2 J increments were then selected surrounding this value and each was administered eight times in balanced random order (total 48 trials). The relationship between energy and percent success in defibrillation exhibited a shallow slope, with a gradual increase in success from 0% to 100% over several energy increments. The initial DFTs showed actual success rates varying from 25% to 87.5% (mean 71 +/- 26%). The results were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve by logistic regression analysis and the energy associated with 50% success (E50) and 80% success (E80) was determined, as no single value for DFT could be defined in any animal. In 12 other dogs, a defibrillation curve was similarly constructed at baseline and was repeated after 90 minutes. No significant change in E50 (5.0 +/- 2.1 J vs 5.2 +/- 2.7 J) or E80 (6.3 +/- 2.5 J vs 6.6 +/- 3.2 J) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The right ventricular myocardium was clearly delineated from adjacent structures in all patients. The trabeculated pattern of the right ventricle was well seen and was most evident during systole and in patients with right ventricular hypertrophy. The moderator band was discernible in 72% of the subjects, whereas smaller muscular structures such as the papillary muscles were identified less frequently. Magnetic resonance imaging provided a good image of the tricuspid valve leaflets but did not show the pulmonic leaflets well. The clear visualization of the endocardial and epicardial borders obtained with magnetic resonance imaging allowed measurement of wall thickness and of the internal dimensions of the cavity in normal subjects, in patients with moderate to severe systolic overload, and in patients with moderate to severe diastolic overload. Patients with severe systolic overload of the right ventricle had markedly thicker walls when compared with patients without this condition. The mean internal dimension at end diastole of patients with severe diastolic overload of the right ventricle was significantly increased when compared to other subgroups. Magnetic resonance imaging provides tomographic images of the right ventricle with clear distinction of the endocardial and epicardial surfaces that can be useful for quantitative and qualitative assessment of this complex structure.\r"

The different morphologies (regular and irregular) of the occlusive lesions did not show a significant relation with the response (reperfusion vs nonreperfusion) to intracoronary streptokinase; neither did the presence of angiographically visualized thrombus in the infarct-related artery favor reperfusion. Among the clinical variables analyzed (previous myocardial infarction, previous angina, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, use of tobacco, and hyperlipidemia), a history of previous angina was significantly related to absence of reperfusion (p = 0.001). Although the presence of thrombus showed a trend toward reperfusion (p = 0.1), overall, our angiographic observations did not contribute to predicting the response to streptokinase. Further studies are needed to identify morphologic criteria favoring reperfusion and select groups of patients most likely to benefit from it.\r"

Exercise tests were consecutively performed by 208 survivors of uncomplicated MI (no heart failure, postinfarction angina, recurrent infarction, or late arrhythmias) and by 92 survivors of complicated MI. After uncomplicated MI (1-year mortality rate 4%), an achieved workload greater than 70% of age-predicted maximum identified 145 patients at very low risk (predictive value for survival 98%). After complicated MI (1-year mortality rate 13%), an exaggerated heart rate response was the best predictor of outcome, but had low (92%) predictive value of survival at 155 bpm. It is concluded that stress testing has only limited value after complicated MI. After uncomplicated MI, exercise variables are extremely helpful in identifying patients at very low risk in whom further investigations are not warranted.\r"

Prior estimates have ranged from 2% to 30% area change during the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study was to measure cyclic dimensional changes in the aorta and pulmonary artery of dogs by a very sensitive technique, mercury strain gauge plethysmography. Gauges were fixed around the pulmonary artery and the aorta and changes in vessel circumference were recorded under the following conditions: increased preload, increased afterload, decreased preload, and during administration of dobutamine, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min. Percent change in circumference of the aorta at baseline was small (mean circumference change = 4%, SD = 1%, SEE = 0.5). Percent change in the pulmonary artery at baseline was slightly larger (mean circumference change = 6%, SD = 5%, SEE = 2%). Mean aortic area change was 9% (SD = 2%) and for the pulmonary artery it was 12% (SD = 10%). No experimental manipulation significantly altered the percent cyclic change in vessel size from baseline except for clamping the inferior vena cava, in which mean percent change in aortic circumference decreased to 1% (SD = 1%, SEE = 5%) (p less than 0.05). Percent change in the aorta correlated only weakly with heart rate (r = 0.48), blood pressure (r = 0.4), and CO (r = 0.46). Similar values were obtained for the pulmonary artery. These data demonstrate a small but definite cyclic change in pulmonary artery area, and to a lesser extent in aortic area.\r"

The method has been validated against a standard infrared absorption (IR) procedure using a tracer dose of deuterium oxide (2H2O) of approximately 10 g for each human subject. The precision and accuracy for the methods have been compared and found to be very similar. The advantages of the 2H NMR method over other presently available techniques that are based on 2H2O dilution are as follows: it is fast, accurate, needs only a small dose of 2H2O, can be done using any body fluid, and, most importantly, does not require any sample preparation.\r"

With data from 900 controls the percentage of New Jersey white men who eat specific vegetables and fruits primarily in certain seasons, the relative importance of in-season and out-of-season consumption, and the median length of season were determined. Although first asking whether a food item was consumed all-year-round or primarily in certain seasons and then asking for the appropriate frequency of consumption facilitated the interview, obtaining out-of-season frequency of consumption and length of season was not necessary. Substituting 0 for reported out-of-season frequencies and 3 mo for reported season lengths reduced slightly the observed associations between diet and lung cancer risk but did not modify the overall pattern noted. Carotenoid intake in winter-fall was estimated to be about two-thirds that in summer-spring.\r"

Causal morning and 24-h urines were collected analyzed for crystalluria, pH, calcium, phosphorous, oxalate, creatinine, sodium, potassium, citrate glycosaminoglycans, and pyrophosphate. The results demonstrated that the longer the supplementation period of pumpkin seeds, the better were the results. Pumpkin seeds lowered calcium-oxalate crystal occurrence and calcium level but increased phosphorus, pyrophosphate, glycosaminoglycans, and potassium values in urine as compared with orthophosphate supplementation. Pumpkin seeds provide high phosphorus levels and can be used as a potential agent in lowering the risk of bladder-stone disease.\r"

Significant increase in physical activity was observed in the intervention group. Activity measures were weakly related to each other. Results of factor analyses suggest that factor I reflected voluntary leisure-time pursuits (such as walking) and factor II, activities of daily living. Participation in sports was not a significant contributor to overall activity of the women. Research on physical activity must define the particular dimension of activity measured. Several types of instruments should be used because different instruments reflect different activity patterns which, in turn, may be differentially related to disease.\r"

In this study anthropometric indicators were explored in 81 Asian mothers living in Birmingham. Single (distance) measurements (eg, weight at 28 wk, etc) were not effective predictors. Changes in measurements of the arm during the second trimester were predictive, and triceps skinfold remained the most effective predictor of poor fetal growth. This measurement probably reflects the balance of energy intake minus energy expenditure during the critical second trimester when the mother would normally be laying down extra fat in anticipation of later fetal demands.\r"

In studies reporting an increased efficiency in the utilization of energy from fat than from equal amounts of energy from carbohydrate, this increased efficiency is indicated by less energy lost by the animal as heat and more energy retained in the carcass of the animal as fat. Because the energy yield from nutrients and the efficiency of energy utilization appear to differ under various conditions, energy intakes using the Atwater values cannot be assumed to be physiologically equivalent in providing energy to the animal during growth.\r"

Additionally, obesity is associated with increased estrogen production secondary to increased peripheral aromatization. In postmenopausal women, this effect is proportionately more significant because the ovaries no longer contribute to production of estrogen. Obesity also alters the further metabolism of estrogens, resulting in products that retain estrogenic potency. Consequently, the estrogen-sensitive tissues of obese women are exposed to more stimulation than those tissues in leaner women. It is possible that this increased estrogen exposure is responsible for the augmented risk of breast and endometrial cancer observed in obesity. Evidence is accumulating that dietary macronutrients can alter the metabolism and excretion of endogenous estrogen and androgen, providing a potential mechanism by which diet can modulate the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.\r"

Because of the complex meaning of total energy intake, studies that attempt to examine directly the relationship between energy intake and cancer risk are likely to be misleading. Carefully conducted and interpreted studies of height and relative weight may be more revealing, although they are susceptible to diagnostic bias. These studies may prove useful in expanding our limited knowledge about breast and colon cancer, but they will have few direct implications for public health because individuals are not likely to restrict their energy intake voluntarily to a substantial degree, even if the energy-restriction hypothesis is correct.\r"

  ".W": "The authors quantified creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme activity and mass in the serum of 81 uremic and 20 nonuremic (control) patients who had no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of acute myocardial infarction. CK-MB was quantified by three methods: electrophoresis, the QuiCK-MB (International Immunoassay Labs), and the Tandem-E CK-MB (Hybritech, Inc.). The authors then followed all uremic patients for subsequent hospitalization for cardiac disease. Median CK-MB was increased in the serum of the uremic patients as compared with the control patients by all methods. Most uremic patients had CK-MB in serum above the median CK-MB of the control group. Seventeen (21%) uremic patients had CK-MB in serum elevated above the reference range by at least one method. All control patients had CK-MB in the serum within the reference range. Twelve of 81 (15%) uremic patients have subsequently developed acute myocardial infarction (six patients; four died) or angina pectoris (six patients; one died). Eleven patients were specifically hospitalized for cardiac symptoms. One patient had acute myocardial infarction three weeks after renal transplant. With the use of the chi-square test and 2 X 2 contingency tables, patients with CK-MB in serum above 5 U/L by electrophoresis (chi 2 = 5.47; P less than 0.05) or at least 2.9 EU/L by the QuiCK-MB (chi 2 = 6.56; P less than 0.01) appeared to be at increased risk of subsequent hospitalization. The authors conclude that a slight increase of CK-MB in serum is found in most uremic patients. However, CK-MB elevated above reference range in the serum of uremic patients without clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of acute myocardial infarction is not common. When found, elevated CK-MB isoenzyme appears to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiac disease. Therefore, quantification of CK-MB in the serum of uremic patients is more reliable than is implied in the literature.\r"

However, three cases of CMV infection initially diagnosed from antemortem biopsy of skin lesions have been documented in the literature. The authors review in depth one of these three cases and describe two new cases of CMV infection first identified by skin biopsy. The latter two are the first detailed descriptions of this infection in the skin of burned patients. Review of the literature describing cutaneous CMV involvement reveals protean epidermal and dermal manifestations with consistent histologic findings. Recently, however, there has been documentation of histologically occult CMV in patients with disseminated CMV infection. Skin biopsy of cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients is important in the diagnosis of systemic CMV infection.\r"

Fourteen patients were operated. Five erroneous diagnoses were uncovered; inexperience was the main reason for the mistakes. The greatest diagnostic difficulties are encountered in cases of Hurthle cell nodules and malignant lymphoma, but mistakes are likely to disappear after reasonable experience. Thyroid antibodies are of no help in sorting diagnostic problems, because a positive titer is only corroborative evidence of underlying HT and does not rule out an associated tumor. Conversely, a negative titer does not discard the diagnosis of HT. The association of nodular colloid goiter and HT is depicted. Problems of sampling and staining technic are discussed.\r"

Previous studies have primarily examined symptomatic persons, and only one study included a comparison with normal controls. In the present study, the authors examined esophageal mucosal biopsies obtained by the hydraulic suction technic for the presence of intraepithelial eosinophils from 73 adult patients with subjective and objective evidence of GER disease and 12 asymptomatic adult volunteers in whom a series of esophageal function tests were normal. Intraepithelial eosinophils were identified in 23 (31.5%) of adult patients and in 4 (33.3%) of the asymptomatic volunteers. No clinical aspects in the GER patients correlated with the presence of eosinophils. By crude quantitation, rare eosinophils added little to more conventional assessment of histologic esophagitis and were present in one-third of normal subjects. The authors conclude that rare eosinophils in esophageal biopsies may not be a reliable criterion for the histologic assessment of GER disease.\r"

All C. pyloridis strains isolated exhibited uniform biochemical characteristics and had almost identical protein profiles, which indicated that they belong to a relatively homogeneous group distinct from other Campylobacter species. All C. pyloridis isolates were uniformly susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, coumermycin, ciprofloxacin, novobiocin, clorobiocin, and nitrofurantoin.

In the present series, 11 of 171 patients (6.4%) receiving the drug had APT develop. Clinical symptoms varied from mild cough and dyspnea to acute respiratory failure. Chest x-rays demonstrated alveolar and/or interstitial opacities in all 11 patients. The microscopic appearance of APT resembled that seen in lung injury from other drugs. The features were those of diffuse alveolar damage, ranging from the early acute to the organizing phase. Mural and intraalveolar foam cells were a prominent component. The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by positive immunoperoxidase staining for carcinoembryonic antigen. They were further identified as type II pneumocytes by electron microscopic examination. These findings support the concept that amiodarone is responsible for a drug-induced phospholipidosis. APT was clinically reversible in all patients; however, five patients (45%) died of arrhythmia shortly after discontinuation of amiodarone.\r"

The precision, linearity, and lack of carry-over of this instrument was excellent for the entire dynamic range of all nine tested parameters (white blood cells [WBCs], red blood cells [RBCs], hemoglobin [Hgb], hematocrit [Hct], mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and platelets [Plts]). Coefficients of correlation for all directly measured parameters were always 0.98 or greater, with the exception of the MCV and RDW parameters, for which r = 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. Special emphasis was placed on WBC and Plt counts at low ranges. When compared with reference methods the correlation for both parameters was very good, r = 0.99 for WBCs less than 4.0 X 10(3)/microL (4.0 X 10(9)/L) and 0.91 for Plt less than 100 X 10(3)/microL (100 X 10(9)/L). These excellent performance characteristics for the CBC parameters, combined with the ability of the analyzer to perform a full WBC differential (to be described in the next report), make the H*1 a superior advancement in the field of automated hematology.\r"

The partitioning of ethanol and acetone was moderately reduced with these specimens relative to water, while no effect was seen with methanol or acetonitrile. Normal urine only slightly affected relative partitioning, and vitreous humor had no effect. The partitioning reductions observed with blood were not affected by changing the equilibration temperature to 25 degrees C, by lengthening the equilibration time to three days, nor by changing the concentration of the volatiles in the liquid phase. The use of saturated sodium sulfate enhanced the differences in partitioning observed between water and blood. Only with substantial dilution (5:1) of blood specimens was the effect abolished.\r"

Vitreous humor electrolyte and urea nitrogen concentrations were measured in 53 infants dying of gastrointestinal infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), other infectious diseases, and miscellaneous causes to determine whether these parameters would assist in the recognition and confirmation of deaths resulting from dehydration. Significant differences were found when comparing the mean sodium and urea nitrogen levels of infants dying of gastrointestinal infections with those succumbing to SIDS or other causes. We recommend that these determinations be routinely performed whenever the gross autopsy findings are insufficient to explain the death.\r"

No difference was found between epileptics and the control group as far as cellular infiltration, single myocyte necrosis, basophilic cell degeneration, and fresh bleeding were concerned. Fibrosis of the myocardium was measured quantitatively by point counting. The fibrosis was approximately 6% of the muscle mass in both groups. In conclusion, no structural difference in the myocardial composition was found between epileptics and the control group.\r"

In group I, the temperature and CO concentration increased gradually to 35 degrees C and 5.2% in 70 min. The animals died after 9 min, when the values were 20 degrees C and 5.2%, respectively. In group II the animals died after 9 min, when the values were 55 degrees C and 1.95%, respectively. In group III, the temperature was very high (870 degrees C), but the CO concentration was not (0.6-1.3%) after 4 min. The animals died after 5 min. In all experimental groups, marked acidosis and hypoxemia were seen, but the CO2 tension (PCO2) was high, in contrast to previous studies on pure CO poisoning. In group I, the level of carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) was significantly higher (91.2 +/- 3.4% in arterial blood, 87.5 +/- 8.1% in venous blood; p less than 0.01) than in groups II and III. Although the O2 tensions of venous and arterial blood (PvO2, PaO2) were very low, that of arterial blood was higher, suggesting that O2 was still being utilized in the tissues at the time of death. In group II, CO-Hb was high (57.7 +/- 16.0% in arterial blood, 61.2 +/- 20.6% in venous blood) and the acid-base balance indicated marked acidosis. In group III, the CO-Hb, PCO2 and cyanide levels in the blood were very high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In wounds with loss of substance, the complete coating by newly formed basement membrane took longer. There was an early deformation of the holes of hair follicles in the undamaged dermis surrounding the lesion, as well as the appearance of creases that moved toward the center. This process was over within a few days; then the lesion became very small and the holes of the hair follicles reappeared. The results suggest a force of traction bound toward the center of the lesion and acting on the surface, the effects of which on the basement membrane are most evident between the eighth and the 15th days.\r"

Portal venous flow measured by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter in 14 patients with cirrhosis and nine patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, who underwent operation 2-5 yr earlier, was significantly reduced compared with that in unoperated 49 patients with cirrhosis and 17 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension who had esophageal varices (410 +/- 158 versus 660 +/- 263 ml/min in cirrhosis; 443 +/- 185 versus 912 +/- 189 ml/min in idiopathic portal hypertension). In nine patients (six cirrhosis, three idiopathic portal hypertension), portal venous flow and portal vein pressure were measured before and after operation. In patients with cirrhosis, portal vein pressure did not change significantly postoperatively even though portal venous flow was reduced. In contrast, portal vein pressure decreased in two patients with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was reduced. Portal vein pressure was elevated in one patient with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was increased postoperatively as a result of resection of a large gastro- and splenorenal shunt conducted additionally.\r"

Median age of these 47 (53.5 yr) was younger than those without AJPB. The length of the common channel ranged from 15 to 53 mm. The pancreatic-biliary type junction was present in 36 of 39 cases (92.3%). Gallstones were present in 7 of 40 (17.5%). Levels of amylase in bile were high in 10 of 11.

Control subjects and three groups of diabetics were studied: A) no neuropathy; B) peripheral neuropathy; and C) peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Nine diabetics had gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastric t1/2 liquid emptying was similar in all groups and in controls, but liquid gastric emptying in the first 15 min was significantly more rapid in the diabetics than controls. Solid emptying was prolonged in group C patients. There was a significant correlation between t1/2 solid emptying and the severity of neuropathy. The eight patients with slow solid emptying had more neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms than the remaining 22 patients. The type and duration of diabetes, diabetic control, and frequency of retinopathy are independent of gastroparesis. These data indicate that delayed emptying of solids is common (27%) in patients with clinically detectable neuropathy and may often be asymptomatic. Visceral autonomic neuropathy seems the most important underlying factor in diabetic gastroparesis.\r"

  ".W": "The relative bioavailability of single oral doses of prednisone with and without sucralfate administration was determined in 12 healthy male volunteers. Each subject participated in a randomized three-way cross-over study consisting of the following three phases: treatment A, prednisone given alone; treatment B, 2 days pretreatment with sucralfate with a concomitant dose of sucralfate administered with prednisone; and treatment C, 2 days pretreatment with sucralfate with a sucralfate dose administered 2 h after the oral prednisone dose. Plasma prednisolone concentrations (active moiety of prednisone) were determined by a specific and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic assay and unbound prednisolone concentrations were determined by equilibrium dialysis. Bioavailability was assessed by comparing the areas under the plasma prednisolone concentration-time curves as well as peak concentrations, time to peak concentration, elimination rate constant, and half-life. No significant differences were noted in any of the treatment phases for any of the parameters except for the time of peak concentration which was slightly delayed from 1.0 +/- 0.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.9 h when sucralfate was concomitantly administered with the prednisone. Thus, the data from this study indicate that sucralfate does not have a clinically significant effect on the bioavailability of orally administered prednisone. The use of these two drugs in combination does not result in an interaction requiring dosage regimen alteration.\r"

In 30 of these patients, treatment was carried out entirely in an outpatient setting, providing more time at home and saving costs of hospitalization. Most patients had received prior radiation and chemotherapy. All were unable to swallow solid food; 16 had difficulty with liquids. Palliation was achieved in 69% allowing patients to eat a nearly normal diet. Therapy was least successful in cancers involving the cervical esophagus, in cancers more than 8 cm in length, and in cancers that were primarily infiltrating or extraluminal. Epidermoid carcinomas and adenocarcinomas were effectively treated, except for adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia, which tended to be infiltrating. There were two serious but nonfatal complications, one perforation and one episode of bleeding, directly attributable to Nd:YAG laser therapy. An esophageal dilation prior to endoscopic Nd:YAG laser treatment facilitated outpatient management.\r"

Upper gastrointestinal series is the most useful radiological tool for detecting these lesions. Ultrasound and CT play a useful role in documenting the origin of these large masses, as well as their spread. Endoscopy is being used with increasing frequency, but because these are submucosal lesions diagnosis cannot easily be made through the endoscope. Pathologically, these tumors can be subdivided histologically into a benign epithelioid leiomyoma and two varieties of malignant epithelioid leiomyosarcoma. Prognosis correlates with histological features. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy have no proven efficacy in treating epithelioid leiomyosarcoma. Unlike most other gastric malignancies, a favorable prognosis follows successful resection.\r"

Formulas are presented to generate expected covariance matrices for assortment or assortative placement on many variables simultaneously. It is demonstrated that all linear models in human genetics can be reduced in form to two fundamental equations. An algorithm is presented that will allow the application of these two equations to linear modeling in human genetics.\r"

This molecular analysis demonstrated the presence of a unique 4,237 base pair (bp) deletion extending from 3.3 kilobases (kb) 5' of the beta-globin mRNA cap site to approximately the middle of beta IVS-2.

Eighteen aspirates contained malignant cells; in 13 of these, a definite cell type was identified, which usually was metastatic lung carcinoma; in five instances, the cell type could not be unequivocally identified. Complications were minimal, two instances of pneumothorax (6.3 percent) and two of hemoptysis (6.3 percent). No deaths or hemorrhage occurred. In 16 of the 29 patients (55 percent), thoracotomy was avoided because of fine-needle aspiration biopsy. It is concluded that fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mediastinum is a safe, useful diagnostic tool. This procedure may obviate the need for thoracotomy in persons with inoperable cancer, thus lowering medical costs and length of hospital stay.\r"

Since the plasma sodium level is determined by the ratio between the total quantity of effective solutes (primarily sodium and potassium salts) and the total body water, abnormalities in the plasma sodium level must be produced by a change in one or more of these parameters. In most patients, alterations in body water are of primary importance because the plasma sodium level is normally regulated by changing water intake and water excretion. Measurement of free water excretion has traditionally been calculated by using a formula that includes the urine osmolality. However, urea is a major urinary solute but does not contribute to regulation of the plasma sodium level, since it is an ineffective osmole. As a result, urinary solute excretion is best expressed as 2 X UNa+K. Making this important correction allows solute and water intake and excretion to be compared, thereby leading to a better understanding of both the development and correction of disturbances in the plasma sodium level.\r"

One family member had findings consonant with papillary serous adenocarcinoma of ovarian origin, which may have arisen directly from extra-ovarian pelvic mesothelium. These and other clinical nuances of familial ovarian carcinoma are discussed in order to aid physicians in understanding the natural history, surveillance, and management of familial ovarian carcinoma.\r"

Histoplasma complement fixation titers to mycelial antigen were not demonstrable in three of three patients in whom they were measured. Of the four patients with AIDS, Histoplasma capsulatum was isolated from bone marrow aspirates in two patients and from lymph node and liver biopsy specimens in one patient each. One of the bone marrow specimens showed organisms on Gomori-methenamine silver stain. In the other three cases, results of staining were falsely negative and diagnosis awaited culture results weeks later. Amphotericin B therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement in the three patients that were treated. Intravenous therapy was followed by treatment with oral ketoconazole. Follow-up has not been long enough to determine the ultimate efficacy of ketoconazole. Disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered in all patients from the Caribbean or South America with AIDS or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Twenty-two subjects had bacteriuria that resolved spontaneously; bacteriuria subsequently developed in 24 nonbacteriuric subjects; and 26 subjects had bacteriuria that resolved with antimicrobial therapy. Subjects occasionally reported urinary symptoms (especially incontinence) and commonly reported symptoms indicating a lack of well-being when they were with and/or without bacteriuria. However, no differences in symptoms were found when bacteriuric subjects were compared with themselves when they were nonbacteriuric.

There was a larger increase in lymphocyte potassium in patients with tachyarrhythmias than in patients without (70.4 and 46.9 pmol/100 cells, respectively, p less than 0.001), whereas the presence of a high lymphocyte magnesium level was associated with a significant decrease in the development of tachyarrhythmias, despite high potassium concentrations.

  ".U": "87097318\r", 
  ".W": "Because we so rarely know the cause of hypertension, antihypertensive therapy remains empiric. However, certain principles of treatment are emerging; one of these concerns the critical role of the kidney in antihypertensive therapy. Whether or not the kidney is primarily responsible for hypertension in a patient, it is the patient's renal response to treatment that determines, to a major degree, an agent's efficacy. Vasodilators have been a conceptually attractive approach to the treatment of high blood pressure, because they decrease total peripheral resistance, which is considered to be the mechanism responsible for this condition in most patients. Nonspecific vasodilators exert a series of actions on the kidney--including profound sodium retention and reactive renin release--that limits therapeutic response. For reasons that are not yet clear, but are apparently related to specific action on calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle, endocrine function, and renal hemodynamics, calcium channel blocking agents, such as nifedipine, have an advantage in the treatment of hypertension. They cause little or no sodium retention; thus, the addition of a diuretic agent is not required. In fact, there is evidence that sodium loading in certain patients may potentiate the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs. The renin-angiotensin system seems to be activated to a somewhat lesser degree by calcium channel blocking agents than it is by nonspecific vasodilators; in addition, these agents interfere with the actions of angiotensin on aldosterone release. Moreover, their dilator action on the renal blood supply favors sodium excretion. Nifedipine either has no effect on the renal blood supply or induces an increase in renal blood flow and maintains glomerular filtration rate, both of which combine to support the ensuing natriuresis.\r"

  ".W": "Nifedipine is frequently administered by the sublingual route to provide rapid onset of intense effect, especially in patients in whom urgent reduction of elevated blood pressure is indicated. Previously available data, however, suggest that peak levels of nifedipine are higher and occur earlier when the drug is administered orally. Results of pharmacodynamic studies show that maximal hypotensive effects occur between 30 and 60 minutes after administration by either route, but that such effects are often achieved earlier when the drug is given orally. Recent work implies that the absorption of nifedipine through the buccal mucosa is poor, if it occurs at all, and that the appearance of nifedipine in plasma requires delivery of the drug to the stomach for active absorption. The small time lag in absorption that may be attributed to the dissolution of the nifedipine capsule may be obviated by biting through the capsule and swallowing the contents; this bite-and-swallow approach to dosing provides the most rapid rise in plasma nifedipine concentrations, and produces peak levels well above those achieved with sublingual administration.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonist monotherapy is more effective in older patients and in those with low plasma renin activity, whereas beta blockers control blood pressure better in younger patients and in those with normal or high renin activity. Monotherapy with a calcium antagonist has been shown to result in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to equal to or less than 95 mm Hg in more than 80 percent of patients with essential hypertension. We investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil plus an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and nifedipine plus a beta blocker in 24 patients (aged 41 to 68) with moderate to severe hypertension in whom monotherapy with a calcium antagonist had been ineffective. Blood pressure recorded in patients during the placebo period was 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). Twelve patients received monotherapy with nifedipine (50.0 +/- 5.2 mg per day) and 12 others received verapamil (460 +/- 20 mg per day); neither treatment resulted in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. However, this goal was achieved when atenolol (89.5 +/- 25.7 mg per day) was added to the regimen of patients receiving nifedipine and enalapril (29.5 +/- 5.0 mg per day) was added to the regimen of those receiving verapamil; resultant blood pressures were 127 +/- 3/83 +/- 2 mm Hg and 137 +/- 5/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. It is suggested that in patients in whom hypertension is inadequately controlled by calcium antagonist monotherapy, counter-regulatory mechanisms can be blocked by the addition of a beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to the calcium antagonist regimen, resulting in greatly improved, simple, well-tolerated, and safe control of blood pressure.\r"

The potentially remediable nature of the tumors is stressed, and frequently a good quality of life can be experienced even in the presence of metastatic disease. The syndromes are probably underdiagnosed as they present with clinical features for which there are more common explanations, and appropriate diagnostic methods are therefore not used. The management of the syndromes is reviewed with particular emphasis on the treatment of patients with inoperable disease. Histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist therapy has made an impact in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and streptozotocin and somatostatin analogues can control tumor growth and endocrine syndromes, respectively.\r"

These groups were as follows: carcinoid tumors present; history of carcinoid tumors; miscellaneous tumors present; and non-tumor diseases. The test with the most sensitivity (i.e., patients with carcinoid tumors labeled positive) and the test with the most specificity (i.e., patients without carcinoid tumors labeled negative) for the presence of carcinoid tumors was determined. Urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion had a sensitivity of 73 percent and a specificity of 100 percent; the plasma concentration of substance P had a sensitivity of 32 percent and a specificity of 85 percent; and the plasma concentration of neurotensin had a sensitivity of 41 percent and a specificity of 60 percent. Even when basal plasma concentrations of substance P and neurotensin were elevated, there was no additional increase of these neuropeptides prior to ethanol-induced facial flushing. Although measurements of plasma neuropeptide levels may be helpful in occasional patients with carcinoid tumors, it is concluded that measurements of serotonin overproduction--such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion--are of more general value.\r"

Diuretics are the most frequently prescribed initial medication (76 percent of physicians), followed by beta blockers (44 percent of physicians). Physicians report recent trends, however, towards more use of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and less use of diuretics. Only 59 percent of patients have insurance that covers medication, and about one in four patients report that paying for medications or physicians' fees is \"very much\" or \"somewhat\" of a problem.

  ".W": "In 1985, the rate of growth of national health expenditures was more than twice the overall rate of growth in prices in the United States, while the percentage of health expenditures relative to the Gross National Product reached a record high of 10.7 percent. There have been almost no changes in the fraction of direct patient payments for medical care since 1980, or in the fraction paid by third parties or the government. Consequently, cost increases in the gross price of medical care are being transferred directly to the patient population. The expense associated with medical treatment and the availability of managed care systems (Health Maintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider Organizations, among others) have contributed to the increasing cost consciousness of patient and physician alike. One of the areas in which the spiralling costs of medical care are most deeply felt is in the treatment of hypertension. The direct costs for treating this condition, which affects more than 25 percent of the American population, exceed $8 billion annually. Furthermore, hypertension is a chronic condition in which the cost of treatment is continuously apparent to the patient. Moderate and severe hypertension is more likely to affect elderly and black patients, the people who are least able to pay for therapy. Difficulty in paying for therapy is becoming an increasingly important problem due to the trend among physicians to prescribe newer and more expensive antihypertensive drugs instead of the more commonly used diuretics and beta blockers. Due to the cost-conscious attitude of patients, the physician who chooses the more expensive drugs may run the risk of losing patronage among middle- and upper-income patients. In the case of lower-income patients, prescribing expensive drugs may result in noncompliance. In order to guard against incursions by managed care systems and ensure the best care for low-income patients, physicians must assume a cost-conscious attitude toward the treatment of hypertension.\r"

By applying the best principles of stepped care to a more individualized methodology, a \"profiled-care\" approach to treating hypertension has been made available. Profiled care may prove particularly valuable in treating hypertensive patients in black urban communities where all forms of hypertension are disproportionally represented because of various physical, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors. Along with efforts by the government and private sectors to eliminate barriers to effective hypertension control in poor black communities, profiled care can help achieve control equal to that achieved in more affluent communities.\r"

The cost burden of treatment may significantly compromise care for the individual patient, while in aggregate the direct costs of antihypertensive treatment in the United States approach $8 billion a year. Improved insurance coverage and efforts to control the costs of antihypertensive treatment are needed. Efforts to reduce the costs of care, with minimal or no reduction in its quality, should focus on the following: limiting treatment to patients with sustained diastolic hypertension; improving the efficiency of the delivery process; and emphasizing \"low-cost prescribing strategies.\" The uncertainty that remains over the risk-benefit ratio of pharmacologic treatment for patients with very mild hypertension (90 to 94 mm Hg diastolic) raises additional questions. Even if treatment of mild hypertension is effective, it is without doubt less cost-effective than treatment of moderate and severe hypertension. Is this cost worthwhile? Such trade-offs of cost and benefits will increasingly have to be confronted in the face of limited health care resources.\r"

In addition, no significant correlation was noted between mean serum estradiol levels and the extent of coronary artery disease as classified by the number of obstructed coronary vessels. A matched-pairs analysis was carried out in which patients who had normal coronary arteries were matched with those who had coronary artery disease on the basis of age, cigarette smoking, prior history of myocardial infarction, and body mass index. The mean serum estradiol level in the patients with coronary artery disease was 28.7 pg/ml, and the mean estradiol level was 31.4 pg/ml for the matched patients with normal coronary arteries. In addition, when serial (three) estradiol determinations were carried out in 100 patients, no association was observed between degree of estradiol variability and the occurrence and/or extent of coronary artery disease.

Cardiovascular reactivity was evaluated with two different mental arithmetic tasks before and six months after treatment by continuously measuring systolic and diastolic pressure (ultrasonic Doppler device), heart rate (electrocardiography), and stoke volume (impedance cardiography). Patients in both treatment groups had equal decreases in arterial pressure and the same pressures at rest. In patients receiving calcium entry blockers, mental challenge provoked an increase in stroke volume and a decrease in total peripheral resistance similar to results in the pretreatment phase. In contrast, beta adrenoreceptor blockade reversed the hemodynamic response pattern to a distinct decrease in stroke volume (p less than or equal to 0.05) and an increase in total peripheral resistance (p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, an attenuated heart rate response (p less than or equal to 0.01) and a larger increase in diastolic pressure (p less than or equal to 0.01) were found in the beta blocker group compared with the calcium entry blocker group. Although beta blockers and calcium blockers produce equal decreases in arterial pressure, beta blockers evoke an abnormal hemodynamic response to mental challenge, whereas calcium entry blockers preserve the physiologic reactivity pattern of the untreated state.\r"

A total of 235 patients with syncope in whom a cause was not assigned or suggested by the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiography were studied. Although a variety of arrhythmias were documented during monitoring, the vast majority of arrhythmias were of short duration and did not produce symptoms. At two years, the patients with frequent or paired premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) when compared with patients with rare PVCs, had a higher incidence of sudden death (18.2 percent versus 4.0 percent; p less than 0.001) and higher overall mortality (28.3 percent versus 10.8 percent; p less than 0.003). Similarly, patients with ventricular tachycardia, when compared with patients with rare PVCs, had a higher incidence of sudden death (18.7 percent versus 4.0 percent; p less than 0.0001) and higher overall mortality (36.5 percent versus 10.8 percent; p less than 0.00001). Cox regression analyses revealed that frequent or repetitive PVCs and sinus pauses were independent electrocardiographic predictors of sudden death and mortality in patients presenting with syncope. Therefore, patients with syncope and frequent or repetitive ventricular ectopy or sinus pauses constitute a high-risk subgroup and may be candidates for more extensive diagnostic evaluation.\r"

A serum prolactin concentration of more than 8,000 mU/liter was always due to a prolactin-secreting adenoma. Prolactin levels of less than 8,000 mU/liter occurred with a variety of pathologic diagnoses. Fifteen patients had lesions other than pituitary adenomas, most commonly intrasellar craniopharyngioma; 10 of these had modest hyperprolactinaemia (maximum, 5,260 mU/liter) and four had received inappropriate bromocriptine therapy. Adenomas that were not prolactinomas frequently caused mild hyperprolactinaemia, although this was usually less than 3,000 mU/liter; three of these patients, however, had serum prolactin concentrations greater than this (maximum, 8,000 mU/liter). If the serum prolactin concentration is less than 3,000 mU/liter in the presence of significant pituitary enlargement, surgical removal is essential for both diagnosis and treatment since only prolactin-secreting adenomas are likely to shrink with dopamine agonist therapy. A serum prolactin concentration between 3,000 and 8,000 mU/liter is consistent with any diagnosis, whether the fossa is greatly enlarged or not, and great care must be taken with dopamine agonist therapy in such patients.\r"

The records of 75 patients with scleroderma seen over a four-year period at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were retrospectively reviewed to determine the prevalence of Barrett's metaplasia and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and to identify clinical, manometric, laboratory, or radiographic criteria that might predict the presence of these lesions. Twenty-four of these patients underwent endoscopy. In this group, the prevalence of Barrett's metaplasia was 37 percent (nine patients) and adenocarcinoma was also present in two of these patients. The patients with and without Barrett's metaplasia were similar in age (range, 22 to 64 compared with 28 to 79, respectively), sex (six of nine compared with 12 of 15 female, respectively), frequency of esophageal motility disorders, presence of proximal skin involvement, digital ulceration, and pulmonary involvement as measured by diffusion capacity. Barrett's metaplasia was diagnosed on the basis of double-contrast esophagographic results in only one of eight patients with Barrett's metaplasia so-studied. Patients with Barrett's metaplasia tended to have longer duration of heartburn (90 +/- 40 months compared with 11 +/- 35 months) and dysphagia (39 +/- 22 months compared with 7 +/- 3 months). Patients with Barrett's metaplasia also tended to have greater impairment of lower esophageal sphincter pressure either at end-expiration (4.0 +/- 2.1 compared with 6.1 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) or mid-respiration (13.0 +/- 3.0 compared with 16.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). Using chi-square analysis, however, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Discrimination did occur on the basis of the presence of the CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal manifestations of scleroderma, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasis) variant (55 percent compared with 7 percent, p less than 0.01), a duration of dysphagia of more than five months (p less than 0.03), and mid-respiratory lower esophageal sphincter pressure of less than 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). It is suggested that: Barrett's metaplasia of the esophagus occurs in one third of patients with scleroderma; clinical, manometric, laboratory, and radiographic features are poor predictors of the presence of Barrett's metaplasia; patients with CREST syndrome, prolonged dysphagia, or a very low lower esophageal sphincter pressure may have an increased risk for the development of metaplasia; patients with scleroderma and Barrett's metaplasia have an increased risk of complications such as stricture or adenocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ten patients with Friedreich's ataxia (seven females and three males, age 15 +/- 7 years) were compared with 10 age-matched normal subjects (five males and five females, age 16 +/- 7 years). The mean systolic blood pressure in the patients with Friedreich's ataxia was lower (114 +/- 9 mm Hg) than that in the control subjects (122 +/- 8 mm Hg; p less than 0.05); diastolic blood pressures were the same. The heart rate in the patients with Friedreich's ataxia (102 +/- 17 beats/minute) was greater than that in the control subjects (76 +/- 12 beats/minute; p less than 0.001). The interventricular septal wall thickness was much greater in Friedreich's ataxia (13 +/- 2 versus 8 +/- 1 mm, p less than 0.001) as was the posterior wall thickness (13 +/- 3 versus 8 +/- 1 mm, p less than 0.001). The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was smaller in Friedreich's ataxia (35 +/- 6 mm versus 47 +/- 6 mm; p less than 0.01), and the fractional change of the left ventricular minor axis with systole was greater in Friedreich's ataxia (40 +/- 9 percent versus 33 +/- 5 percent; p less than 0.05). An 11th patient with Friedreich's ataxia (age 33) had clinical heart failure, but his course was complicated by alcohol abuse. Heart biopsy in three patients with Friedreich's ataxia demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy (21.5 +/- 2.0 microns diameter; normal, 14 to 17 microns) and increased fibrosis (16 +/- 9 percent; normal, less than 5 percent). Thus, heart disease in Friedreich's ataxia is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, increased left ventricular wall thickness, decreased left ventricular cavity size, sinus tachycardia, and normal systolic function. Further biochemical analysis of tissues may lead to the link of the neurologic and cardiac diseases and eventually to more effective therapy of this condition.\r"

  ".W": "In neuromuscular disease, the precise relationship between general and respiratory muscle weakness is at present unclear. That relationship and the influence on respiratory muscle strength of such factors as type and duration of neuromuscular disease, distribution of general muscle weakness, and nutritional status were studied in 30 patients with stable chronic neuromuscular disease not presenting with respiratory symptoms. The degree of general muscle weakness was assessed by clinical examination of the strength of 17 muscle groups, yielding a general muscle strength index. The degree of respiratory muscle weakness was assessed by measuring maximal static inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures. Maximal inspiratory (mean +/- SD: 68 +/- 28 percent predicted) and expiratory (66 +/- 29 percent predicted) mouth pressures were frequently reduced, but did not correlate with general muscle strength. The ability to estimate the degree of respiratory muscle weakness improved to some extent when the type of neuromuscular disease and the distribution of general muscle weakness were taken into account: thus, maximal expiratory mouth pressure was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in myopathy than in polyneuropathy, and in proximal than in distal muscle weakness. Duration of neuromuscular disease and nutritional status did not influence respiratory muscle strength. It is concluded that in stable chronic neuromuscular disease, respiratory muscle involvement depends on a complexity of factors, in particular the type of neuromuscular disease and the distribution, rather than the degree, of general muscle weakness. In the individual patient, however, only direct measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures allows accurate assessment of respiratory muscle strength. These tests ought to complement neurologic examination.\r"

The greatest improvement followed treatment with the ipratropium-fenoterol combination (0.53 +/- 0.40 liters at 45 minutes; 0.57 +/- 0.51 liters at 90 minutes) and was significantly greater than that following either ipratropium alone (p less than 0.001) or fenoterol alone (p less than 0.05). In 51 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (mean one-second forced expiratory volume, 0.67 +/- 0.29 liter), each regimen produced significant improvement in one-second forced expiratory volume at both 45 and 90 minutes (for all, p less than 0.05), but there was no significant difference among the three treatment regimens. It is concluded that, in patients with acute asthma, combination therapy with sympathomimetic and anticholinergic agents is more efficacious than either one alone. In patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although either sympathomimetic or anticholinergic therapy provides bronchodilatation, no further benefit could be demonstrated from combination therapy.\r"

Although the basis of this noncompliance is multifactorial, it is largely related to deterioration in a patient's quality of life produced by the commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents. Quality of life is a collective term that encompasses multiple components of a person's social and mental status. Simply stated, it is the ability of a person to function normally in society, as perceived by the person. There is increasing evidence that social and behavioral science techniques can be used to quantify the effects of antihypertensive agents on a patient's quality of life. Thus, in determining the most appropriate antihypertensive program for an individual patient, physicians will now be able to add impact of the agent on quality of life as a dimension in addition to the more common triad of efficacy, cost, and serious side effects.\r"

They have also been reported to usually decrease total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and, in some studies, to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Prazosin, a quinazoline derivative, is well tolerated and is not associated with chronic toxicity. Prazosin has been successfully used in the treatment of hypertension for more than 10 years. Its short plasma half-life requires twice-daily dosing. Although the hypotensive response to an initial dose of prazosin is usually greater than to subsequent doses during long-term therapy, the initial response is an accurate predictor of the hypotensive response in patients during long-term therapy. The vasodilatory action of prazosin is largely due to its blockade of vascular postjunctional alpha 1 receptors. The mechanism involved in its effect on lipid levels is currently under investigation and is an important consideration since hypercholesterolemia, as well as hypertension, is an independent risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease. Reduction of blood pressure with conventional agents, such as beta blockers or diuretics, has not had the expected impact on coronary heart disease. However, since alpha 1 blockers may influence both hemodynamics and lipids, they warrant evaluation as first-line treatment of hypertension to confirm that they also have an effect on coronary heart disease.\r"

Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated the importance of single risk factors and the extent of their interaction. These studies have demonstrated that the incidence of coronary heart disease is greatly augmented if more than one risk factor is present. The recent British Medical Research Council mild hypertension trial demonstrated that blood pressure reduction was highly effective in preventing stroke, although there were important differences between smokers and nonsmokers with regard to the efficacy of individual drugs. In this trial, there was no overall reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity or mortality. Other trials such as the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study on Antihypertensive Agents, the United States Public Health Service Hospital Cooperative Study, the Australian Therapeutic Trial in mild hypertension, and the European Working Party Trial on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly have failed to demonstrate significant reduction in coronary heart disease mortality. The Pooling Project and other epidemiologic studies have identified other factors that are associated with increased coronary heart disease; these include glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, obesity, lack of exercise, and, more arguably, type A personality. Methods of controlling these factors should involve both patient education programs promoting change in life-style, such as those proposed by the American Heart Association, and pharmacologic interventions. The British Medical Research Council trial and other such trials have shown the importance of interactions between antihypertensive therapy and individual risk factors, not all of which are readily predictable and some of which may be adverse. Coronary heart disease is now the leading cause of death in many countries and is the major unsolved problem in the treatment of hypertension. A successful attack on this problem would necessarily involve application of a number of measures and the tailoring of such measures to the needs of individual patients.\r"

Results of various other clinical trials suggest that the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin has a significant impact on two of the three primary coronary heart disease risk factors. In the articles reviewed herein, prazosin is shown to be an effective agent when used alone or in combination with other agents. Stamler and co-workers showed that prazosin alone achieves successful control of blood pressure equal to that of hydrochlorothiazide. Inouye et al compared the effectiveness of prazosin with propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide and found all three drugs to be comparable. Okun reveals the efficacy of prazosin across the spectrum of hypertension--mild, moderate, and severe. Additionally, Okun's prazosin versus captopril study revealed equal efficacy between these two drugs. The long-term comparative data of Lowenstein and Neusy show prazosin and atenolol to be equally effective as monotherapy after one year.\r"

However, some issues concerning this type of treatment have yet to be resolved. For example, it has not been determined whether there are differences among antihypertensive agents with respect to their effects on mortality and morbidity or whether such effects are independent of the alterations in blood pressure resulting from the use of such agents. Thiazide diuretics, the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs, were the first agents proven to be effective and practical for the widespread treatment of hypertension. Alpha blockers, also commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs, provide equally effective blood pressure control to that of the thiazides, but with a very different metabolic profile. In this article, these drugs are compared for efficacy, side-effect profiles, metabolic effects, and potential for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol is regarded as a protective cholesterol fraction that is negatively associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease. Thus, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol levels is an expression of the total atherogenicity--the higher the ratio, the lower the risk of coronary heart disease. There is a sharp contrast between alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers with regard to their effect on the profile of blood lipids. In most studies, alpha blockers increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreased serum triglyceride levels. In addition, alpha blockers generally reduce total serum cholesterol levels. On the other hand, most beta blockers reduce serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increase serum triglyceride levels. European clinical trials recently investigated the effects of alpha blockers and beta blockers on blood lipids in a total of 104 and 281 patients with hypertension, respectively. On the average, selective alpha blockade increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol:total cholesterol ratio by 11.3 percent and reduced serum triglyceride levels by 11.4 percent. In contrast, the selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol reduced that ratio by 11.7 percent and increased serum triglyceride levels by 25.8 percent. This difference between alpha and beta blockers may significantly influence the risk profile of coronary heart disease and should be given strong consideration when choosing drug therapy for hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "The primary hemodynamic hallmark of essential hypertension is elevated systemic vascular resistance that may be affected by increased sympathetic tone, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, or structural and cellular abnormalities (e.g., those involving calcium) of the blood vessel wall. The aim of therapy, therefore, is to reduce vascular tone through the use of a specific blocker of neurohormonal mechanisms or a nonspecific vasodilator. These agents are not equally effective in all patients. In comparing these drugs, the following issues are important: pathophysiology, patient demography, mechanism of drug action, long-term efficacy, and metabolic effects. Several studies have suggested that there is a response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young and middle-aged patients, whereas in elderly patients there may be more of a response to calcium channel blockers. Alpha 1-adrenergic blockers, however, appear to be effective in all age groups. Calcium channel blockers and alpha 1-adrenergic blockers generally are more effective in black patients than are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Neither of these agents adversely affects serum potassium, glucose, or plasma lipid levels. In fact, data suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic blockers may reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Unlike alpha-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers may produce a negative inotropic effect and improved cardiac diastolic relaxation. In addition to all of these factors, it is important that the agent selected as initial antihypertensive therapy be efficacious, have a favorable side-effects profile, and have no adverse influences on other risk factors.\r"

In the past, physicians were primarily concerned with blood pressure reduction; the side effects of antihypertensive agents were a matter of lesser concern. Today, however, drugs can be selected for therapy on the basis of providing optimal antihypertensive efficacy and minimal harmful side effects. Furthermore, now that blood pressure can be effectively managed and the overall incidence of stroke has been reduced, perhaps the aim of therapy in patients with hypertension should include the reduction of coronary heart disease incidence. Three broad categories of antihypertensive agents are available: diuretics, antisympathetic agents, and vasodilators. Each class of drugs has its own pattern of action and produces optimal efficacy in identifiable patient populations, and each has a distinct side-effect profile. Knowledge of these variables and a scheme that can identify patients likely to benefit from a specific agent are paramount considerations in the treatment of hypertension.\r"

As would be expected, overall systolic and diastolic blood pressures were found to be lowest in the normotensive subjects and highest in the untreated hypertensive patients. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values for patients receiving prazosin twice daily were significantly lower than in the untreated patients; they were slightly, but not significantly, higher than the values recorded for the normotensive volunteers. The data from 24-hour monitoring revealed no between-group differences in the actual circadian rhythm of the blood pressure. This finding established that the blood pressure pattern for hypertensive patients treated with prazosin was parallel to that for normal individuals. Thus, prazosin administered twice daily reduces blood pressure throughout a full 24-hour period in a fashion that maintains the normal circadian pattern of the blood pressure.\r"

This study evaluated the therapeutic effect of titrated doses of prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, on systemic blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in elderly patients with chronic stable hypertension. Prazosin alone or co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide significantly lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in 31 elderly hypertensive patients. At the same time, however, there was no significant change in cerebral blood flow, which was measured in eight patients. Neither harmful biochemical changes nor treatment-related adverse effects were observed in any patients. Prazosin therapy alone or in combination with low-dose diuretic therapy was effective in the treatment of hypertension in this elderly population. Furthermore, blood pressure reduction with prazosin therapy was accomplished without compromising cerebral blood flow and without unfavorably altering lipid profiles.\r"

All three types of treatment reduce blood pressure to about the same degree, but with considerable individual variability with respect to their impact (positive or negative) on coronary heart disease risk. Hypokalemia, increased cholesterol levels, and hyperglycemia are common side effects of diuretic therapy that may exert a negative impact on coronary heart disease risk. Of the adrenergic inhibitors, the central agonists reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas the alpha blockers generally have no adverse effect on cholesterol levels and may block coronary alpha receptors, both of which would have a positive impact on coronary risk. Beta blockers, the other class of adrenergic inhibitors, produce effects that can both negatively impact (lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increase triglyceride levels) and positively impact (prevent arrhythmias and reverse left ventricular hypertrophy) coronary heart disease risk. The various types of vasodilators affect coronary risk differently: direct vasodilators stimulate sympathetics (negative impact), and converting enzyme inhibitors reverse left ventricular hypertrophy (positive impact). The effects of diuretics, adrenergic inhibitors, and vasodilators on all of these parameters need to be considered in the choice of therapy, particularly for the majority of asymptomatic patients with mild hypertension who are at relatively low risk for coronary heart disease.\r"

To test the hypothesis that patients with slowly evolving disability from mitral stenosis frequently do not recognize the degree of their limitations and to determine the utility of formal exercise testing, 24 consecutive patients with pure or predominant mitral stenosis were evaluated for NYHA functional category (NYHA class) by historical determination of functional impairment, echocardiographic mitral valve area (echo MVA), exercise duration, estimated maximum oxygen consumption, and functional aerobic impairment during a symptom-limited Bruce protocol exercise test and multiple catheterization-derived parameters. The data revealed no difference in exercise duration or mitral valve area between NYHA classes, but demonstrated an excellent correlation between exercise duration and severity of mitral valve stenosis determined at cardiac catheterization (cath MVA). This relationship was similar to that of echo MVA to cath MVA and exceeded that of exercise time to any other parameter measured during catheterization. Estimation of maximum oxygen consumption or functional aerobic impairment did not improve the exercise duration to valve area relationship. The data presented thus demonstrate that Bruce protocol exercise testing is a valuable adjunct to other noninvasive tests in the initial evaluation of selected patients with mitral stenosis. By virtue of being easily repeated at low risk, exercise testing may also be useful in long term follow-up of medically treated mitral stenosis patients.\r"

Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment.

Blepharospasm and dysfluency of the extrapyramidal type antedated the torticollis. This first report of torticollis in PSP reinforces previous notions that torticollis is related to pathologic changes in the striatum and brainstem. In addition, the combination of torticollis and blepharospasm in our patient supports the previous concept that these two \"focal dystonias\" have a common pathophysiologic mechanism. This also suggests that dysfluency in PSP may be an expression of a focal dystonia involving the muscles of articulation.\r"

Urinary diagnostic indices (including urine-to-plasma ratios of creatinine, urea nitrogen, and osmolality) were generally consistent with a prerenal etiology for the observed oliguria. Conversely, invasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed a volume replete state in five of seven preeclamptic women studied. All patients were observed to have markedly elevated urinary sodium concentrations. The transient oliguria observed in these patients spontaneously resolved without diuretic or hyperosmolar agents. We conclude that oliguria is a poor index of volume status in preeclamptic women. Urinary diagnostic indices may also be misleading if used to guide fluid management in these patients. Finally, the clinical significance and therapeutic alternatives relating to preeclampsia-associated oliguria are discussed.\r"

Other imaging methods showed this only as a focus of stable scarring. The antibody scan guided surgical resection of this tumor focus, which on gamma counting had a tenfold excess of antibody activity compared with that of the normal lung. This approach may be useful in detecting occult foci of gestational choriocarcinoma for surgical resection in patients with rising levels of the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and is under further evaluation.\r"

It was our hypothesis that if the allegedly \"high\" rate of cesarean sections was the result of mediocre or flawed practices, these should be most evident in patients delivered abdominally. A group of 59 patients delivered vaginally were compared with 37 patients delivered by cesarean section. The means of many variables were not statistically different. The cesarean section group was characterized by smaller stature, a lesser cervical dilatation rate both before and after oxytocin administration, a larger maximum oxytocin dose, a longer period of oxytocin administration, more frequent cessation of oxytocin administration or dose reduction because of hypercontractility or an abnormal fetal heart rate or both, and a higher incidence of intra-amniotic infection. We conclude that the decision to perform cesarean section in nulliparous women with functional dystocia arises from disabilities of the patient and not from differences in the application of our management principles, services, or treatments.\r"

Sixty-one pregnant patients undergoing screening for gestational diabetes underwent a 1-hour carbohydrate tolerance test of both glucose and a glucose polymer within 3 days of each other. Analysis of the data revealed a high degree of agreement between the results of the 1-hour carbohydrate tolerance test (kappa = 0.62, p less than 0.0001).

Since the improvement of pregnancy outcome is of particular relevance in low-income populations, we have compared the characteristics of women with planned and unplanned pregnancies in central Harlem with regard to those factors that might affect pregnancy planning such as sociodemographic factors, attitudes toward child-rearing, environmental stress, social support, and maternal mental health. Of the 416 women in the study, a minority (27%) reported their pregnancy as being planned. They differed from the remainder in being more likely to be married and/or living with a boyfriend or husband and to have been born outside New York City. The two groups did not differ in any other risk factor or in outcome in terms of birth weight and gestational age. The results provide little support for the lack of planning of pregnancy as an indicator of risk in a low-income population and suggest that improvement of perinatal outcome must involve more broadly based interventions that are not confined to the periconceptional period.\r"

There was a significant correlation between plasma estradiol levels and endometrial blood flow in the follicular but not the luteal phase. Blood flow patterns in women with ovulatory dysfunctional bleeding were similar to normal, except for a significantly lower middle follicular rate. Women with anovulatory dysfunctional bleeding exhibited exceedingly variable flow rates.\r"

The effective pressor dose before treatment (17.4 +/- 2.2 ng/kg/min) (mean +/- SE) was significantly less (p less than 0.001) than that after treatment (35.1 +/- 4.2 ng/kg/min). Low-dose aspirin therapy resulted in an enhancement of the pregnancy-acquired refractoriness to angiotensin II.

Blood samples were taken on days 6, 11, 21, and 28 of a control cycle, the third cycle of treatment with either ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel or ethinyl estradiol-desogestrel (11 volunteers each), the third cycle of a 3-month washout period, and the third treatment cycle after crossover change of the preparations. There was a significant reduction in total testosterone by 16% during treatment with both preparations. Ethinyl estradiol-desogestrel increased the concentration (+175%) and binding capacity (+330%) of sex hormone-binding globulin to a much greater extent than with ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel (+92% and +160%). Contrary to this, a significant suppression of non-protein-bound testosterone by 35% was found during treatment with both oral contraceptives. The results demonstrate that an excessive elevation of the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin above the normal range does not cause a corresponding suppression of free testosterone. It is assumed that the decrease in the apparent binding affinity of high sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations to testosterone may be due to protein-protein interactions.\r"

We found that smoking after natural menopause is associated with a 70% reduced risk of endometrial cancer among estrogen users and a 50% reduced risk among nonusers of estrogen. These findings are consistent with previously proposed biologic effects of smoking on estrogen metabolism, which may have important clinical implications.\r"

Papillomaviral deoxyribonucleic acid was detected by Southern blot hybridization in 197 (90%) of the 218 principal biopsy specimens and 93 (46%) of 198 secondary biopsy specimens. Although different papillomaviruses were found at different sites in 31 women, only six of 416 specimens contained multiple types within the same sample. Specific viral types were associated with specific disease patterns. Only one of 80 type 6 or 11 infections had a diagnosis greater than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2. In contrast, 42 of 48 (90%) biopsy specimens of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3, or invasive cancer contained type 16, 18, or 31. Nonetheless, 12 of 124 (10%) cases of condyloma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1, were associated with types 16, 18, and 31 infections. Of 58 women with multicentric disease, 46 had positive hybridizations for both cervical and vulvar lesions (32 showing the same type in both samples and 14 showing different viruses). Differing patterns of papillomavirus-induced disease arise partly from the predilection of specific viral types for certain anatomic sites and partly through variations in host response. Detection of viral deoxyribonucleic acid in 46% of the secondary biopsy specimens suggests that disease expression may represent focal breakdown of host surveillance within a field of latent papillomaviral infection.\r"

(2) If so, what is the impact of such reductions on fetal oxidative metabolism? In 15 chronically catheterized pregnant sheep and fetal lambs, we measured uterine and umbilical blood flows and uterine and fetal oxygen deliveries, oxygen extractions, and oxygen consumptions at various, randomly selected maternal hematocrits ranging from 30% to 8%. We altered maternal hematocrit by performing isovolemic exchange transfusions with plasma or packed red blood cells. Uterine and umbilical blood flows were measured with the radionuclide-labeled microsphere technique, and the variables of oxygenation were calculated with modifications of the Fick principle. Decreases in maternal hematocrit led to linear reductions in oxygen delivery to the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Despite reductions in oxygen delivery of up to 50%, fetal oxygen consumption was maintained, because of compensatory increases in oxygen extraction. When hematocrit (and thus fetal oxygen delivery) was reduced by more than 50%, fetal oxygen consumption and the arterial blood base excess both decreased, indicating that, at these hematocrit levels, the supply of oxygen to fetal tissues was inadequate for the demands for oxygen by these tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Triiodothyronine has been found to enhance gonadotropin- and insulin-stimulated morphologic luteinization and progesterone production by porcine granulosa cells in culture. The role of triiodothyronine in the above events is not well defined. One possibility is that triiodothyronine effects are direct and are receptor mediated. To test this concept, we undertook this study to investigate the presence of triiodothyronine receptors in granulosa cells aspirated from large (6 to 12 mm), medium (3 to 5 mm), and small (1 to 2 mm) porcine ovarian follicles. Crude nuclei were isolated and tested for iodine 125-triiodothyronine specific binding. Binding was time and temperature dependent and maximal in cells from small follicles at pH 8. Scatchard analysis yielded a mean apparent dissociation constant of 5.5 X 10(-9) mol/L and a mean apparent total number of binding sites of 1.0 pmol/mg of deoxyribonucleic acid. Competition experiments revealed the following relative binding affinities: triiodothyronine greater than L-thyroxine greater than reverse triiodothyronine. Gonadotropins, prostaglandins, epidermal growth factor, and insulin did not compete with 125I-triiodothyronine for binding. We conclude that there are nuclear binding sites in porcine granulosa cells with characteristics expected of a triiodothyronine receptor which might mediate a direct action of triiodothyronine on granulosa cells.\r"

Maternal plasma salicylate concentrations (mean +/- SD) of 12.0 +/- 1.6 mg/dl (low-dose group) or 24.1 +/- 5.3 mg/dl (high-dose group) were achieved. Control rabbits were infused with saline solution. Pups were delivered by hysterotomy on day 29. Fetal/maternal salicylate concentration ratios were near unity for both infusion groups. There were significant dose-related reductions (mean +/- SD) in fetal weight (control, 39.7 +/- 6.7 gm; low-dose group, 34.4 +/- 6.4 gm; high-dose group, 22.2 +/- 7.1 gm; p less than 0.001) and in crown-rump length (control, 9.7 +/- 0.45 cm; low-dose group, 9.1 +/- 0.68 cm; high-dose group, 7.7 +/- 0.86 cm; p less than 0.001). There was a significant reduction in fetal brain weight only in the high-dose group, and brain weight/fetal weight ratios were increased, suggesting relative sparing of brain growth. Liver weight was significantly reduced in both low- and high-dose groups. In contrast to results in previous animal studies, standardized intravenous maternal salicylate administration in rabbits induced a reproducible and dose-dependent asymmetrical fetal growth retardation.\r"

Data from a cohort of 359 neonates, from a large prospective observational study in which chronic alcohol problems and maternal drinking were assessed during pregnancy and standardized neonatal examinations were blinded for prenatal information, were analyzed with the use of multivariate techniques, with uniform control for confounding by eight factors. Craniofacial abnormalities were found to be definitively related to prenatal alcohol exposure in a dose-response manner (p less than 0.001); a significant, but less striking, relationship was observed for other anomalies (p less than 0.01). The critical period for alcohol teratogenicity was confirmed to be around the time of conception. Risk for anatomic abnormalities in the offspring was clearly defined among the 5.6% of infants whose mothers drank more than three ounces of absolute alcohol, that is, more than six drinks, per day. Because of a trend toward an increase in craniofacial abnormalities with increasing embryonic alcohol exposure at lower levels, a clear threshold could not be defined. These are not experimental data and the results should not be overinterpreted. Nevertheless, pending further studies with larger samples, the findings suggest that to completely avoid alcohol-related anatomic abnormalities, advice to discontinue drinking or at least to reduce it to a minimal level before conception is clinically appropriate.\r"

Thirty-three parturient women (21 vertex-breech and 12 vertex-transverse presentations) were allocated for vaginal delivery and 27 for cesarean section (18 vertex-breech and nine vertex-transverse). Six pairs of twins in the vaginal delivery group were delivered in a different mode than requested by the protocol (two women underwent cesarean section; in four cases the second twin spontaneously changed to vertex presentation). There were no significant differences between 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores and incidence of neonatal morbidity between the second-born twins in both study groups. Firstborn twins had higher 1-minute Apgar scores than the second-born infants irrespective of route of delivery (p less than 0.05). No case of birth trauma or neonatal death was recorded. Maternal febrile morbidity was significantly higher in the cesarean section group than in the vaginal delivery group (40.7% versus 11.1%, p less than 0.05). These results suggest that in twins with vertex-breech or vertex-transverse presentations after the thirty-fifth week of gestational age the neonatal outcome of the second twin was not significantly influenced by the route of delivery.\r"

The overall vaginal delivery rate was 59.2%. Comparing route of delivery in the induction and augmentation groups separately revealed no significant differences in maternal height, weight, or parity, duration of membrane rupture, length of oxytocin treatment or maximum dose, cervical examination on admission or before oxytocin treatment, or use of conduction anesthesia. A previous vaginal delivery favored repeat vaginal delivery in patients with augmentation while a nonrecurrent indication was significantly associated with vaginal delivery in all patients. After the beginning of oxytocin augmentation, the cervical dilatation rate was 1.82 cm/hr in patients delivered vaginally, compared with 0.18 cm/hr in those requiring cesarean section (p less than 0.001). Any cervical dilatation during the first 2 hours of augmentation was associated with more frequent vaginal delivery: 24 of 40 vaginal deliveries (60%) versus six of 24 cesarean sections (25%, p less than 0.01). Discriminant analysis correctly identified route of delivery in 85.3% of those with induction and 87.5% of patients with augmentation. During a trial of labor, oxytocin induction or augmentation is effective in a majority of patients. Furthermore, an early response during augmentation is of predictive value when such patients are being managed.\r"

It was injected into the vitreous of 38 rabbit eyes after mechanical vitrectomy or gas compression of the vitreous with perfluoropropane. The eyes were observed for periods of up to five months. Clinically the liquid occupied the lower vitreous space but gradually dispersed into smaller fluorochemical droplets. In the upper vitreous clusters of cells appeared within three to four weeks which precipitated on the posterior lens surface and in the cortical vitreous. In eyes with experimental retinal detachment perfluorotributylamine had physical properties which provided mechanical retinal tamponade. Its interfacial tension prevented passage through iatrogenic retinal breaks. Histopathologic findings showed irregularly shaped defects in the outer segment disks as early as two days after vitreous replacement. These changes appeared to reverse if perfluorotributylamine was removed after two days. The cellular response in the vitreous consisted primarily of monocyte-derived macrophages capable of ingesting fluorochemical (foam cells).\r"

The freezing time and the temperature of 11 lesions were recorded. The light microscopic finding of an intranuclear clear center with peripheral displacement of clumped chromatin against the nuclear membrane was suggestive of intranuclear ice crystal formation but did not indicate cellular death of the tumors. The major ultrastructural changes, including plasmalemmal breaks, dissolution of cytoplasmic matrix, and damage to various organelles, however, suggested acute necrosis in tumors not exceeding 7 mm in elevation. Failure of the melanoma cells to grow in tissue culture and positive staining with trypan blue support the contention of tumor death. The late effects of rapid freezing were also evaluated in another case of uveal melanoma. The eye was enucleated six months after cryopexy. Histopathologic findings showed that the tumor was necrotic. Failure of the neoplasm to regress (noted clinically) was related to edema and inflammatory infiltrates.\r"

Experimentally, immunologically activated mononuclear phagocytes stimulated with endotoxin (LPS) produce TNF, while resting mononuclear phagocytes stimulated with LPS produce little TNF. To date, the ability of human alveolar macrophages (AMs) to produce TNF has not been clearly delineated. As pulmonary sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder characterized by immunologically activated AMs, we investigated the production of TNF by AMs obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 7 normal volunteers and 13 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The AMs were cultured with and without LPS, and TNF production was assessed by an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. Unstimulated sarcoid and normal AMs produced little TNF, but LPS stimulation enhanced TNF production by both normal and sarcoid AMs. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated sarcoid AMs produced more TNF than normal AMs (84.9 +/- 16.7 versus 32.5 +/- 10.2 units/million cells, P less than 0.05). It is concluded that human AMs can produce TNF and that sarcoid AMs are primed and can produce significantly more TNF, compared with normal AMs.\r"

The data presented showed that in the first 12 weeks of feeding a 0.1% cholesterol-rich diet, rabbit aortas were covered with an intact endothelium. Focal areas of increased endothelial cell replication were observed adjacent to the aortic ostia at 12 and 20 weeks. These replicating cells were almost exclusively located at the shoulders of large raised lesions. In a similar fashion, adherent leukocytes were observed adjacent to the aortic ostia, and at later times they were concentrated at the periphery of these intimal lesions. Smooth muscle cell replication, as assessed by autoradiography, was found to be significantly increased only after 20 weeks of feeding the lipid-rich diet. These data suggest that an increased endothelial cell turnover and leukocyte adhesion were the first detectable changes induced by cholesterol feeding and that smooth muscle cell proliferation occurred soon after these events.\r"

Mean cell volume per nucleus increased with infarct size in both zones, but the rate of change was greater in the border than in the remote portion of the unaffected myocardium. Capillary numerical density within the uninjured tissue progressively decreased with infarct size leading to an increased diffusion distance for oxygen. Although the magnitude of changes in capillary density was similar in the two regions of the ventricle, the analysis of the individual values in each heart showed that in infarcts comprising more than 11% of the ventricular wall capillary concentration and the path length for oxygen supply to the myocytes were affected more in the border zone than in the myocardium remote from the scar. In conclusion, the border zone participates in the hypertrophic recovery process after infarction, but the inadequate growth of the capillary microvasculature suggests that this region is more susceptible to additional ischemic episodes.\r"

In this communication the authors have examined the possible role of glomerular endothelial cells as potential regulators of mesangial cell proliferation. Conditioned medium was collected from confluent cultures of glomerular endothelial cells and tested for its effects on glomerular mesangial cell and vascular smooth muscle cell growth. When glomerular endothelial cell-conditioned medium was mixed 1:1 with normal growth medium, the growth of these two closely related cell types was inhibited by 60-70%. If the conditioned medium was diluted to 1:9, a stimulation of mesangial and smooth muscle cells growth was seen. Approximately 70% of the antiproliferative activity was destroyed by a highly purified heparinase; the other 30% was sensitive to trypsin. Approximately 90% of the mitogenic activity was protease-sensitive. These results suggest that glomerular endothelial cells may participate in part in mesangial cell growth regulation via a heparin-mediated mechanism.\r"

At birth, examination by light microscopy (LM) in all dogs showed normal glomerular capillaries, but by electron microscopy (EM), many GCBM showed separation of endothelial from visceral epithelial cell basement membranes. By LM, glomerular capillaries of affected males appeared normal for up to 4 months, but then isolated and eventually all capillaries became thickened and split. However, by EM, a bilaminar appearance of the GCBM was seen within 1 month which evolved into multilaminar splitting that became extensive as renal failure ensued. Carrier females showed mild nonprogressive changes in GCBM. These results with SHG permitted speculation on the evolution of splitting of GCBM in human HN.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular proliferation is regulated not only by the action of growth factors and growth inhibitors whose effects are reversible but also by factors that induce the irreversible loss of proliferative potential associated with the terminal event in cellular differentiation. The authors have employed 3T3 T mesenchymal stem cells as a model system to study the terminal event in cellular differentiation because in these cells' distinct nonterminal and terminal states of differentiation can be identified and because transition from the nonterminal to the terminal states of differentiation can be induced by human plasma. In this paper is reported the 20,000-fold purification of a component of human plasma that induces the terminal event in differentiation. This factor is shown to have an apparent molecular weight of approximately 45,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.6. It is trypsin-sensitive, acid and heat-labile, and is resistant to treatment with dithiothreitol and alkali. The ability of this human plasma protein to induce the irreversible loss of proliferative potential associated with the terminal event in differentiation serves as the basis for its designation \"aproliferin.\" The data in this paper in addition show that no other pharmacologic or physiologic agents have been identified that can mimic the biologic effect of aproliferin. Therefore, aproliferin appears to be a functionally distinct protein in human plasma.\r"

Various studies indicate that disease resistance in CVB3o-infected mice results from generation of suppressor cells. Low-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg body weight) treatment enhances inflammation in both CVB3M and CVB3o-infected animals, which clearly demonstrates that CVB3o has the capacity to induce disease, but inhibitory factors must exist preventing myocarditis. Spleen cells obtained from mice 10 days after CVB3o inoculation inhibited myocarditis induction in CVB3M-infected recipients, which confirms the presence of suppressor cells in these animals. The suppressor cell belongs to the Lyt 2+ subclass of T lymphocytes and specifically interferes with CVB3-induced myocarditis but fails to inhibit T-cell-mediated cardiac injury triggered by an unrelated virus, encephalomyocarditis virus.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have used SDS-PAGE and lectin overlay analysis in parallel with lectin-gold cytochemistry to identify Helix pomatia lectin (HPL) binding glycoconjugates in rat kidney glomeruli. Previous work revealed HPL binding sites only beneath podocyte foot process bases, where they contact the glomerular basement membrane. It is shown here that after neuraminidase digestion of thin sections of glomeruli before incubation with HPL-gold complexes, the number of HPL binding sites is markedly increased. These new sites are mainly associated with the podocyte free surface (adjacent to the urinary space) and with capillary endothelial cells. By lectin overlays, this neuraminidase-dependent HPL binding was shown to be due to reaction of the lectin with desialylated podocalyxin. In contrast, HPL binding sites detected prior to neuraminidase digestion are associated with a novel glycoconjugate having a lower electrophoretic mobility than podocalyxin. Although any role for this glycoconjugate is at present speculative, it is strategically positioned at the site of interaction between foot process bases and the glomerular basement membrane. Its presence correlates with normal podocyte architecture, as shown by our previous studies on developmental and aminonucleoside nephrosis-associated changes in HPL binding to podocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical investigations were carried out on the properties of the cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in focal hepatic injuries. A liquid nitrogen-cooled syringe needle was thrust into the rat liver. Necrotic areas became permeated with plasma within 24-hour period. Areas became strongly positive for fibronectin and were infiltrated with inflammatory cells positive for lysozyme. By the third day, Ito cells were proliferated in the peripheral portions of the damaged areas. These Ito cells showed enhanced immunostaining for desmin and actin but were negative for lysozyme. Interstitial fibers which were immunochemically positive for Types I and IV collagens, laminin, and fibronectin, began to increase from Day 3. They appeared on the rim of the hepatocytes adjacent to the damaged areas and extended into the injured regions with the Ito cells. An increase in basal laminas associated with capillaries and bile ducts also increased with a 1-day delay. The damaged areas were replaced by granulation tissue by Day 5. A rapid diminution then occurred in the granulation tissue, and normal hepatic tissue was restored in 7-10 days. These observations demonstrate that ECM changed in a sequential manner and then finally disappeared from the damaged site within 10 days. Although various cells, including parenchymal cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and cholangiolar cells contributed to the healing of the damaged area, Ito cells, which exhibit unique phenotypic changes, presumably had a major role in the process.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, a histopathologic examination of the brain from iron-deficient or iron-supplemented rat pups was carried out. Pups were obtained from female rats, which were fed an iron-deficient or iron-supplemented diet during both pregnancy and lactation. Immediately after anesthesia and the collection of blood, pups were fixed by intracardiac infusion of 2% glutaraldehyde. Brain and cervical spinal cord were fixed, embedded in paraffin, and cut at 6-mu thickness. Myelin was identified using Luxol fast blue stain. As compared with controls (hematocrit, 30.8%), 11-day-old iron-deficient pups (hematocrit, 11.9%) showed reduced myelination in the spinal cord. Although myelination increased somewhat in the iron-deficient 17-day-old pups (hematocrit, 8.5%), the amount of myelin in the spinal cord and white matter of cerebellar folds was reduced as compared with that of the corresponding controls. These observations show the importance of prenatal iron adequacy in myelinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "DSM-III suggests that axis IV should have prognostic value--that patients with higher scores will have a better outcome than patients with low ratings. The authors used axis IV to assign scores to 130 depressed inpatients and examined these scores in association with the patients' course during the index hospitalization and at 6-month prospective follow-up. Higher axis IV scores were associated with more depressive symptoms on hospital discharge, but they did not predict follow-up outcome. These results are consistent with other studies of the prognostic value of ratings of psychosocial stress and indicate that, at least for depression, there is little empirical support for DSM-III's suggestion that stress is a favorable prognostic sign.\r"
