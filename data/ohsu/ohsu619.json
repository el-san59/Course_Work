All three patients were men who presented with chronic cholestatic liver disease at ages 32, 46, and 62 years, respectively. In each patient, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed the typical findings of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Histologic features of liver biopsy were compatible with the diagnosis. Two patients had associated chronic ulcerative colitis. All three patients complained of frequent loose stools and weight loss; subsequent testing showed severe steatorrhea (204 to 323 mmol/d of fecal fat on a 100 g fat diet). Total villous atrophy was found in all three patients on histologic examination of the small bowel. Celiac disease was diagnosed at the time of presentation in two patients who had primary sclerosing cholangitis and was diagnosed three years after the onset of primary sclerosing cholangitis in the third patient. The celiac disease responded to a gluten-free diet in each patient whereas the primary sclerosing cholangitis was not affected by dietary treatment. The possibility of a chance association of primary sclerosing cholangitis and celiac disease cannot be accurately assessed but seems unlikely given the rarity of both diseases. The relationship between the two diseases remains unknown, although an immunologic connection is suspected. Celiac disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe steatorrhea in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

DESIGN: The study was prospective, controlled, and blinded. Each patient received active drug and placebo. Platelet counts were compared before and after receiving zidovudine. SETTING: Outpatient clinics in Geneva, Lausanne, and Zurich, Switzerland. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of ten patients (five intravenous drug addicts, four homosexual men, one Zairian) who were seropositive for HIV, and had platelet counts between 20 and 100 X 10(9)/L (20,000 to 100,000/mm3). Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were not enrolled. None had been previously treated for thrombocytopenia, and no medication except zidovudine or placebo was administered during the trial period. INTERVENTIONS: Five patients received 8 weeks of zidovudine (2 g/d for 2 weeks, and 1 g/d for 6 weeks), followed by 8 weeks of placebo. The other five patients received placebo for 8 weeks followed by zidovudine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Platelet counts increased in each patient while on zidovudine, but not while on placebo; the mean increase was 54.6 X 10(9)/L +/- 11.25 (SE) from 53.2 to 107.8 X 10(9)/L (P less than 0.004). After the end of zidovudine treatment, platelet counts remained elevated for more than 4 weeks in three of five patients. One patient developed granulocytopenia and anemia during treatment with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS: Zidovudine is a potential new treatment for HIV-associated thrombocytopenia.\r"

The larger corneal astigmatism occurred after opening the anterior chamber with Graefe's method; the best results were obtained using Worsth's knife.

  ".W": "A new carbacephem analog of cefaclor, LY163892, was examined along with four other cephalosporins for chemical stability and for antibacterial activity under a variety of susceptibility test conditions. LY163892 was found to be markedly more stable than cefaclor during storage at 4 and 35 degrees C in human serum, human urine, and various bacteriological media. Under these conditions, LY163892 demonstrated stability equal or superior to the stabilities of cephalexin, cephalothin, and cefuroxime. Broth and agar dilution susceptibility tests did not reveal significant differences in LY163892 activity in a variety of test media, although LY163892 MICs were somewhat higher in Mueller-Hinton chocolate agar or Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) than in other media. The activity of LY163892 against selected pathogens was only slightly influenced by the increased or decreased pH of the test medium, in a manner similar to that of the other cephalosporins tested. Thus, the carbacephem structure of LY163892 appears to represent a more stable cephalosporin than cefaclor, while retaining a similar antimicrobial spectrum.\r"

The drug was extracted from 0.05 ml of serum with 0.2 ml of isopropanol containing beta-hydroxypropyltheophylline, the internal standard. Separations were performed on a C18 column at ambient temperature with detection at 240 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetate buffer (0.05 M sodium acetate) containing tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and methanol (pH 5.1; 70:30, vol/vol). The method was linear to 500 micrograms of cefpirome per ml and had a sensitivity of 0.6 micrograms/ml. Analytical recovery was greater than 86%, and the between-day coefficient of variation was less than 4.2%. The stability for 1 week at 4 to 8 degrees C and for 30 days at -20 degrees C was documented. Interference with commonly used antibiotics, analgesics, methylxanthines, and anticonvulsants was not found. The small sample volume and ease of preparation make this method suitable for use in pediatric pharmacokinetic investigations of cefpirome.\r"

The recombinant plasmid obtained, pBBB21, conferred methicillin resistance on its host and was responsible for the synthesis of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP 2'. PBP 2' determined by the S. epidermidis DNA and expressed as a membrane-bound PBP in S. carnosus reacted with monoclonal antibodies directed against PBP 2' of Staphylococcus aureus origin, and the cloned S. epidermidis DNA hybridized to the methicillin (mec)-specific DNA from S. aureus. These findings point to a common origin of the methicillin resistance determinant in staphylococci.\r"

Samples from two volunteers were also assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean peak level in serum, 4.7 micrograms/ml, was attained within 1 h of administration. The mean elimination half-life from serum was 7 h. Inflammatory fluid was penetrated rapidly, with a mean peak level of 3.5 micrograms/ml occurring after 2.7 h. The mean recovery of lomefloxacin from urine over 48 h was 76% of the administered dose. There was a minor peak on the high-performance liquid chromatography trace, suggesting a small amount of unidentified metabolite. This was present only in urine; no detectable metabolites were found in serum. This study suggests that either once-daily or twice-daily dosage of lomefloxacin should be sufficient to treat urinary or systemic infections, respectively, caused by susceptible pathogens.\r"

On the basis of these data, a dosage adjustment strategy, which incorporates the severity of infection and the size and renal function of the patient, was developed. An adaptive (feedback) control algorithm is proposed. A total of 32 subjects (8 normal, 8 anuric, and 16 with CLCR between 0.53 and 4.3 liters/h per 1.73 m2) were given a single 750-mg tablet of ciprofloxacin by mouth. Serial serum and urine samples were collected, assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and comodeled. The population relationship between total apparent ciprofloxacin clearance (CL/f) and CLCR, both measured in liters per hour per 1.73 m2, was CL/f = 2.83 x CLCR + 21.8 (r = 0.69; P less than 0.001). The mean terminal half-life was not significantly related to CLCR but was much more variable in subjects with CLCR less than 3 liters/h per 1.73 m2 (F = 4.8; P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with CLCR less than 1.2 liters/h per 1.73 m2 should receive two-thirds of the normal daily dose and that the dose interval should not be lengthened.\r"

Roxithromycin caused lactate dehydrogenase leakage close to that of erythromycin estolate and higher than erythromycin base after 21 h of exposure to the drugs. This effect was, at least in part, explained by the higher uptake: roxithromycin was two to three times more concentrated by liver cells than erythromycin base. For both roxithromycin and erythromycin base, the uptake depended on time, temperature, and extracellular antibiotic concentration. The accumulated macrolides egressed rapidly when cells were incubated in antibiotic-free medium. No uptake and no loss of accumulated drugs were observed at 4 degrees C. After accumulation by hepatocytes, roxithromycin and erythromycin base underwent similar subcellular distribution, mostly concentrating in cytosol and lysosomes. The small amount accumulated in the other particulate fractions followed the order mitochondria much greater than nuclei greater than microsomes. Roxithromycin, however, was less concentrated than erythromycin base in the microsomes.\r"

  ".U": "89049006\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperbilirubinemia is frequently observed in neonates, and serious neurological complications such as kernicterus can be precipitated when the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin is abnormally increased. The administration of drugs which bind to albumin and compete with bilirubin can increase the possibility of such a complication. To test the bilirubin-displacing activity of pharmacological agents that are used with newborns, 52 antimicrobial agents were investigated in vitro. A glycine conjugate of salicylate, 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine, which is known to be present at elevated levels in newborns and has a potent bilirubin-displacing property, was used as a positive control agent. Pooled cord serum was used as a source of hyperbilirubinemic serum. A centrifugal ultrafiltration method with semipermeable cones was employed to determine the effects of potential bilirubin-displacing agents on the levels of total bilirubin. 2-Hydroxybenzoylglycine was demonstrated to be the most potent bilirubin-displacing agent. Antibiotics could be classified into four groups: high-level displacers (sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, dicloxacillin, cefoperazone, and ceftriaxone), intermediate-level displacers (moxalactam, nafcillin, and 14 others), low-level displacers (aztreonam, carbenicillin, and 11 others), and nondisplacers (mezlocillin, cefuroxime, kanamycin, and 15 others). It is concluded that the ultrafiltration method is a rapid and readily reproducible for the determination of bilirubin displacement and that antibiotics with a tendency to displace bilirubin should be avoided in jaundiced newborns whenever appropriate alternatives are available.\r"

All strains of Haemophilus influenzae (MIC for 90% of strains [MIC90], less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90, 3.0 micrograms/ml), and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 and 0.019 microgram/ml) were susceptible to ceftibuten. Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, and G) were also inhibited by ceftibuten, but penicillin-resistant pneumococci were generally resistant to cefixime and ceftibuten. The activity and spectrum of ceftibuten seem most applicable to infections of the respiratory and urinary tract plus those infections caused by pathogenic Neisseria spp. Ceftibuten disks (30 micrograms) were evaluated and found to have an acceptable correlation (r = 0.88) with ceftibuten MICs. Preliminary zone size interpretive criteria for MIC breakpoints of less than or equal to 4.0 and less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml were calculated.\r"

Repeated administrations were performed for 4 days (200 mg every 12 h). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the plasma decay curves of the single and the last of the multiple administrations. Ofloxacin kinetics after the single dose were best described by a two-phase curve with a total body clearance of 241.6 +/- 43.3 ml min-1, a volume of distribution of 112 +/- 23.1 liters, and an elimination half-life of 5.4 +/- 0.8 h. The extrapolated area under the curve (AUC0-infinity) was 14 +/- 2.3 mg.h liter-1. The pharmacokinetics were not significantly modified by repeated administration, demonstrated mainly by the AUC0-12 value of the last infusion (13.4 +/- 2.2 mg.h liter-1). We conclude that, with intravenous multiple doses every 12 h, the steady state is reached within 24 to 36 h and no abnormal accumulation or changes in pharmacokinetic parameters occur.\r"

  ".W": "The penam nucleus can assume two conformations; these are designated open and closed. The synthetic (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams can be regarded as analogs of the open and closed conformations, respectively. It has been shown that the beta-methylenepenams are essentially inactive, suggesting that the closed conformation of penams is also inactive. In this study, we investigated a series of beta-lactams, all of which contained phenylacetamido side chains: penicillin G, the (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams, and the 3-acetoxymethyl- and 3-methylcephalosporins. The alpha-methylenepenam and penicillin G were the most active compounds, while the beta-methylene isomer was only poorly active. Results with permeability mutants suggested that the alpha-methylene compound penetrated the outer membrane somewhat more readily than penicillin G did. The intrinsic potency of the alpha-methylenepenam appeared to be similar to that of penicillin G, on the basis of their affinities for penicillin-binding proteins and their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized Escherichia coli, while the beta-methylene analog had very poor intrinsic potency. The alpha-methylene analog was about 10-fold more efficient (Vmax/Km) than penicillin G as a substrate for the cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, but it was about 40-fold less efficient with penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the active conformation of penams is the open conformation and suggest that the position in space of the carboxyl group relative to the beta-lactam carbonyl is an important determinant of cephalosporinlike character, as distinct from penicillinlike character.\r"

The tonsils of 40 patients were removed at 112 to 329 min after intake of the last dose. Blood samples were collected at the time of tonsillectomy and at 0, 2, and 6 h after the last dose. At all time points, EA produced severalfold more total antibiotic (erythromycin + 2'-AE) concentrations in plasma compared with ES. There were two nonabsorbers in the ES group, but none in the two EA groups. The mean total antibiotic levels in tonsillar tissue after EA treatment exceeded the levels after treatment with ES by a factor of 3 (for EA at 400 mg b.i.d.) and 4.5 (for EA at 500 mg b.i.d.). The ratios of erythromycin concentration in tonsil to that in plasma at the time of tissue removal were quite similar for all groups (means, 0.51 to 0.54). In the EA groups, 2 of 26 (8%) patients had no measurable erythromycin in the tonsillar tissue samples, whereas in the ES group, 3 of 14 (21%) patients had no measurable erythromycin in the same tissue. The degree of hydrolysis of 2'-AE to erythromycin was about 25% in plasma at the time of tonsillectomy for both EA groups and about 40% in tonsillar tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A study of the structure-activity relationship of a series of newly synthesized phosphonylmethoxyalkyl purine and pyrimidine derivatives revealed that several adenine derivatives substituted at the N9 position by a 2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl (PME) group inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced cytopathogenicity and HIV antigen expression in vitro at concentrations significantly below the toxicity threshold for the host cells. In terms of anti-HIV potency in MT-4 cells, the PME 2,6-diaminopurine derivative (50% effective dose [ED50], 1 microM) ranked first, followed by the PME adenine derivative (ED50, 2 microM [MT-4]) and the PME 2-monoaminopurine derivative (ED50, 45 microM). Antiretroviral activity was also demonstrated in ATH8 and H9 cells, which were de novo infected with HIV, and extended to C3H mouse fibroblasts infected with Moloney murine sarcoma virus. Unlike 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine, these compounds were not found to be degraded by deaminases derived from bovine intestine.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of meningitis and the method of parenteral gentamicin administration (intramuscular injection, a 30-min intravenous infusion, or intravenous bolus administration) on achievable concentrations of drug in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In normal animals, only intravenous bolus administration of 2 to 8 mg/kg produced a gentamicin concentration of greater than 0.1 microgram/ml in CSF in some animals. All CSF samples contained less than the limit of detection (0.1 microgram/ml) after the intramuscular administration of 6 mg/kg. In animals with meningitis, gentamicin penetration into cisternal CSF was increased significantly after a bolus administration of 6 mg/kg (mean, 0.197 +/- 0.063 microgram/ml in normal animals versus 1.68 +/- 0.38 micrograms/ml in animals with meningitis; P less than 0.01). In meningitic animals that received 6 mg/kg as an intravenous bolus, lumbar CSF had the highest maximum concentration (4.25 +/- 1.08 micrograms/ml), in comparison with ventricular CSF (3.10 +/- 0.66 micrograms/ml). The gentamicin concentration in cisternal CSF decreased more slowly than it did in serum (elimination half-life, 238.70 +/- 64.56 min in cisternal CSF versus 82.73 +/- 2.91 min in serum), yielding a relative increase in the percentage of penetration. We conclude that maximum penetration by gentamicin into CSF occurs after intravenous bolus administration and that the maximum concentration occurs in lumbar CSF.\r"

BV-araU effectively inhibited EBV replication both in superinfected Raji cells and in virus producer P3HR-1(LS) cells, as determined by density gradient centrifugation, in situ cytohybridization with an EBV DNA probe, and cRNA-DNA hybridization. The 50% effective doses for viral DNA replication were 0.26, 0.06, and 0.3 microM for BV-araU, BVdU, and ACV, respectively. The relative efficacy on the basis of the in vitro therapeutic index was BVdU (6,500) greater than BV-araU (1,500) greater than ACV (850). Synthesis of EBV-induced polypeptides with molecular weights of 145,000 and 140,000 was inhibited by these drugs. Kinetic analysis of reversibility of inhibition of EBV DNA replication after removal of the drugs indicated that BV-araU, like BVdU, has a more prolonged inhibitory effect than ACV. These results indicate that the 2' OH group in the arabinosyl configuration of BV-araU results in marked reduction in anti-EBV activity while slightly diminishing cytotoxicity.\r"

An intravenous dose of 200 mg of ciprofloxacin given 2.5 to 3.0 h prior to cholecystectomy resulted in concentrations in common duct bile, gallbladder bile, and gallbladder wall of 5.69 +/- 4.8, 5.43 +/- 3.34, and 2.52 +/- 1.30 micrograms/g, respectively, all at least fourfold greater than simultaneous concentrations in serum. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in common duct bile exceeded peak concentrations in serum in all but two patients with common duct obstruction. Multiple preoperative doses of ciprofloxacin prior to cholecystectomy increased concentrations in gallbladder bile by eightfold. Six patients with indwelling biliary drainage catheters also received 200 mg of ciprofloxacin intravenously. Less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted in bile as unchanged ciprofloxacin, and there was extensive metabolism. However, peak ciprofloxacin concentrations of 2.83 +/- 0.76 micrograms/ml in serum produced peak concentrations of 10.69 +/- 5.30 micrograms/ml in bile within 1.5 h after infusion and maintained concentrations of at least 0.5 microgram/ml in common duct bile for over 12 h in all patients. It appears that ciprofloxacin concentrations in bile will exceed the MICs for most susceptible biliary pathogens for a period of at least 12 h after a 200-mg intravenous dose.\r"

The concomitant administration of steroids has never been investigated. We evaluated the role of hydrocortisone on gentamicin-induced nephroxicity in a model of infused rats. We showed that hydrocortisone given over 3 days after the infusion did not modify the gentamicin half-life in the renal cortex, gentamicin-induced lysosomal phospholipidosis, or histopathology but did reduce significantly the 3H/DNA ratio on day 4 after gentamicin infusion. We concluded that hydrocortisone interferes with the postnecrotic cellular regeneration process, an important step that is responsible for the recovery of normal kidney structure following toxic injuries associated with aminoglycoside therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of natural purine and pyrimidine nucleosides on protection from or reversal of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) cytotoxicity in human bone marrow progenitor cells by using clonogenic assays. The selectivity of the \"protection\" or \"rescue\" agents was examined in evaluating the antiretroviral activity of AZT in combination with these modulating agents and of AZT alone. Following exposure of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells for 2 h to 5 microM AZT (70% inhibitory concentration), increasing concentrations of potential rescue agents were added. Cells were cultured, and colony formation was assessed after 14 days. At concentrations of up to 50 microM no natural 2'-deoxynucleosides, including thymidine, were able to reverse the toxic effects of AZT. Dose-dependent reversal was observed with uridine and cytidine, and essentially complete reversal was achieved with 50 microM uridine. In the protection studies, 100 microM thymidine almost completely antagonized the inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony formation produced by 1 microM AZT (50% inhibitory concentration), and 50 microM uridine effected 60% protection against a toxic concentration of AZT (5 microM) (70% inhibitory concentration). The antiretroviral activity of AZT in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, assessed by revere transcriptase assays, was substantially decreased in the presence of thymidine, whereas no impairment of suppression of viral replication was observed in the presence of uridine in combination with AZT at a molar ratio (uridine/AZT) as high as 10,000. This demonstration of the capacity of uridine to selectively rescue human bone marrow progenitor cells from the cytotoxicity of AZT suggests that use of uridine rescue regimen with AZT may have potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

The number of viable intracellular bacteria was determined after 2 and 4 days of treatment by lysing cultured macrophages. Treatment for 24 h resulted in an inhibition of growth, as determined by macrophage lysis at day 4, for all three antimicrobial drugs and killing of 22% of intracellular bacteria after treatment with TNF.

Among these, five resistant isolates of C. jejuni and six resistant isolates of C. coli, all with different plasmid patterns, were identified. Each contained at least one plasmid greater than or equal to 41 kilobases in size. The MIC of kanamycin for all 11 strains was determined to be greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml by an agar dilution method. In addition, all of the strains exhibited resistance to tetracycline (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Eight of the 11 strains transferred the kanamycin resistance phenotype to other Campylobacter strains by conjugation. DNA from 9 of the 11 strains hybridized to a DNA probe specific for the 3'-O-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type III gene. The remaining two strains also failed to show homology with DNA probes specific for the genes encoding 3'-O-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase types I, II, and III. The novel kanamycin resistance gene was cloned into the vector pBR322 and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Phosphocellulose paper binding assays on sonicates of the E. coli strain carrying the cloned kanamycin determinant demonstrated significant activity against kanamycin, neomycin, and amikacin but not against butirosin, gentamicin, tobramycin, or lividomycin, suggesting that the enzyme is the product of a 3'-O-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type of aminoglycoside resistance gene.\r"

  ".W": "Methicillin- and gentamicin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Dublin hospitals have been classified into groups I, II, and III based on resistance to antimicrobial agents and plasmid profiles. Each group expresses a characteristic level of resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and sisomicin. Enzyme assays showed that resistant strains expressed 2\"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-6'-aminoglycoside transferase activity by a determinant which is known to be chromosomally located. The gentamicin resistance (Gmr) determinants were transferred from group I, II, or III strains by transduction into a laboratory strain where each expressed the same low level of resistance. This finding suggests that high-level resistance in some clinical strains is due to a second, unlinked resistance mechanism. No evidence was obtained by hybridization experiments that clinical isolates or spontaneous mutants expressing high-level Gmr carried more than one copy of the Gmr determinant, thus eliminating the possibility that a gene dosage effect was responsible for high-level resistance. Hybridization experiments with transductants and wild strains suggested that the Gmr determinant was located at homologous sites in wild strains from different groups, although restriction site differences were observed in flanking sequences. Electron microscope analysis of a cloned Gmr determinant and genetic evidence suggested that a Dublin clinical isolate harbored a transposon very similar to Tn4001.\r"

The ability of new quinolone antibacterial agents such as norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin to inhibit DNA gyrase activity and cell growth was investigated.

Patients were given a single 3-mg/kg intravenous dose of teicoplanin for prophylaxis. Blood and urine samples were collected for 8 days after administration, and teicoplanin levels were determined by microbiological assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from a three-compartment open pharmacokinetic model and from a noncompartmental analysis. Levels in plasma 1 h after the administration averaged 14.8 mg/liter. The half-lives of the two distribution phases were 1.3 and 9.7 h. The half-life of the terminal phase averaged 57.9 h, with similar estimates obtained from the noncompartmental analysis and from data from urine. The volume of distribution of the central compartment was 0.15 liter/kg, whereas the volume of distribution at steady state and during the elimination phase were 0.80 and 1.25 liters/kg. The total teicoplanin clearance averaged 14.8 ml/h per kg, with renal clearance accounting for about 60% of the total. The average cumulative recovery of teicoplanin in urine over 8 days was 59% of the dose, similar to the value obtained in adult volunteers. There was no significant linear correlation between elimination half-life and age. Preliminary data after repeated administration support the reliability of the model used and the validity of the mean estimated parameters. There were no local or systemic adverse reactions to teicoplanin.\r"

Serum 25-OH-D levels were significantly lower among long-term PABA users than among normal controls: 40.2 +/- 3.2 vs 91.3 +/- 6.2 nmol/L. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency, ie, 25-OH-D levels below 20.0 nmol/L, was seen in two PABA users and in none of the controls. This preliminary study suggests that long-term use of PABA may be associated with low body stores of vitamin D in some persons.\r"

The frequency of this eruption was compared with the syndrome's other diagnostic criteria. Thirty-nine (67%) of the 58 patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of Kawasaki syndrome had documentation of the perineal rash that usually occurred in the first week of onset of symptoms. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of coronary artery aneurysms. We believe that an erythematous, desquamating perineal rash is a valuable early clinical finding facilitating a more rapid diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki syndrome.\r"

Two patients had polyadenomatosis, one of whom underwent successful liver transplantation after malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma. Eighteen patients (median age of 33 years, range of 17-45 years) had either a solitary adenoma or two adenomas. Eighty-three per cent were women 87% of whom had received oral contraceptives or other hormone therapy before diagnosis (median duration of 11 years, range of 3-15 years). Fifty per cent of these patients presented with acute hemorrhage into an adenoma. Seventeen patients underwent surgical resection of their adenomas, with the remaining patient currently being treated by arterial embolizations to reduce the tumor size before surgery. There was no operative mortality or serious morbidity, and all patients remain well upon follow-up. Surgical excision of liver adenomas, where this can be done without causing mortality, is recommended. Resection relieves symptoms and removes both the risks of hemorrhaging into the tumour and of malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 19 years, mortality due to burn injuries has markedly declined for children at the Boston Unit of the Shriners Burns Institute (SBI), dropping from an average of 9% of SBI admissions during 1968-1970 to an average of 1% during 1981-1986. Detailed statistical analysis using logistic regression was necessary for determining whether this decline in mortality was explained by changes in patient characteristics, such as age or burn size, which are known to strongly influence the outcome of burn injuries. This dramatic decline in mortality during the past 19 years was not the result of change in the age of the patients or their burn sizes; rather, it may be attributed to improvements in burn care. Results of this statistical analysis indicated that, for burn injury patients whose ages ranged from 11 days to 19 years, age had no demonstrable effect on survival from a burn injury. Children survived burn injuries at least as well if not better than the young adult (20-29 years of age). Also, infants (less than 1 year old) survived as well as other children (2-19 years old). Dramatic improvement in survival occurred in patients with burns covering more than 50% of the body surface area. Since 1979, mortality has been essentially eliminated for patients with burn sizes less than 70% of the total body surface area (of 296 patients with burns covering 15-69% of the total body surface area, only two patients died). During the period 1979-1986, 29 of 37 patients (78%) survived an 80% or greater total body surface area thermal injury.\r"

Cholangitis was the presenting diagnosis in four cases. Fragmentation of the stones was successful in all patients; in two cases, two ESWL sessions were needed for stone disruption. Morbidity was minimal (there was a minor elevation of LDH and transaminases and asymptomatic hemobilia and hematuria); pancreatitis did not occur. After ESWL, hospital stays ranged from 1 to 13 days (mean of 5.3 days). ESWL can be a valuable adjunct in the management of patients with complex biliary stones.\r"

They differed from older patients in that the usual sex ratio was altered (18 men: 19 women), and in certain histologic features. Poorly differentiated or undifferentiated lesions predominated (34 patients), and the distribution of histologic types was unusual; two thirds each were of the diffuse type (Lauren classification) or signet ring type (World Health Organization classification), and over three quarters were infiltrative (Ming classification). Intestinal metaplasia was absent in the majority of patients, and gastritis was less commonly seen than in older patients. Although most patients had long histories of disease and advanced disease, the TNM stages and the proportion undergoing curative resection (8%) were similar to those seen in older patients. Except for one who has survived 5 years, all patients in this study have died.\r"

The length of the interposed segment of jejunum ranged from 20 to 30 cm (median of 22.5 cm) in the Henley patients, and from 30 to 60 cm (median of 40 cm) in the Roux-en-Y group. In Henley patients, the percentage of administered 99mTechnetium-DISIDA that was recovered from the stomach (median of 0.92%) was lower (p less than 0.01) than that obtained for Billroth II patients (median of 32.28%) and did not differ (p greater than 0.10) from that of the Roux-en-Y (median of 0.36%) and duodenal ulcer groups (median of 2.53%). These results indicate that Henley operation is as effective as Roux-en-Y diversion in promoting the reduction of the amount of enterogastric biliary reflux that follows Billroth II distal gastrectomy.\r"

Of 122 patients who had transthoracic resection of esophageal cancer, 27 had pulmonary dysfunction; in six, the forced vital capacity was less than 70% (minimum of 42.8%, mean +/- SD of 56.6 +/- 8.9%); in 18, forced expiratory volume for one second (FEV1%) was less than 70% (minimum of 34.6%, mean +/- SD of 60 +/- 10%); and in three, both forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume was less than 70%. Two patients had undergone hemipneumonectomy before receiving resection of the esophagus. During the intrathoracic operative procedure, high frequency ventilation was used, providing good surgical exposure and contributing to a decrease of postoperative pulmonary complications. There were no deaths during the month after surgery. The survival curve of these patients was not significantly different from that of other patients who had had esophagectomy for cancer of the esophagus. These patients survived for an average of 24 months. The patient who survived the longest has been alive for more than 11 years.\r"

Of the 13 patients with TAR, eight (62%) had associated CC. All patients with CC had two or more of the following positive findings: abnormal ECG, elevated myocardial-band creatinine kinase levels, abnormal radionuclide angiography/left ventricular segmental wall motion studies, or cardiac damage seen at surgery and postmortem examination. Four patients with TAR suffered cardiac arrest; all of the latter patients had associated CC. After successful repair of the TAR, five of six patients with combined TAR and CC developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whereas only one of five patients with isolated TAR had ARDS. All patients with isolated TAR survived, whereas three of eight patients suffering combined TAR and CC died perioperatively, secondary to cardiac arrest. In patients with TAR, the presence of associated CC occurs with increased frequency, is associated with increased morbidity (cardiac arrest, ARDS), and results in increased operative mortality secondary to cardiac instability. A branch-chain decision tree (clinical algorithm) was developed as a means of improving management of patients with combined TAR and CC, including indications for preoperative pulmonary artery catheterization.\r"

  ".W": "Acute aortic dissection occurred in 18 patients who had previously diagnosed atherosclerotic aneurysms of the thoracic and/or abdominal aorta. These patients were reviewed to assess the clinical course when these two forms of aortic pathology coexist. Patients were grouped according to status of their atherosclerotic aneurysm (previously repaired vs. untreated) and the segments of the aorta effected by the acute spontaneous dissection. Group 1 patients (n = 5) had previously undergone-abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy (AAA) repair, and the abdominal aortic suture line effectively terminated the dissection process. In Group 2 patients (n = 5), the acute dissection and the atherosclerotic aneurysm involved different segments of the aorta. Group 3 patients (n = 8) experienced spontaneous aortic dissection involving atherosclerotic aneurysms (five infrarenal, three thoracoabdominal), with threatened or actual rupture occurring in six patients, resulting in three deaths. In Group 3 patients, rupture occurred both at the atherosclerotic aneurysm (four patients) and at the site of the aortic intimal tear of the dissection (two patients) after AAA repair. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has proven to be highly accurate in delineating the nature and extent of pathology in recently encountered patients with complicated aortic disease. Coexistence of atherosclerotic aneurysm and acute dissection appears to increase the risk of aortic rupture, in both proximal and distal aortic segments.\r"

Complications affected 13% of the patients of the Dacron group and 4% of the PTFE group. All six graft infections and all seven graft double-limb thromboses occurred in Dacron grafts. Anastomotic aneurysms, amputations, and late graft revisions occurred with greater frequency in patients with Dacron grafts.\r"

Plasma glycerol concentrations after an overnight fast were significantly higher in cancer patients as compared with control patients, in keeping with an increased adrenal and adrenergic activity. This study demonstrates evidence of simultaneously elevated catecholamine and cortisol excretion in cancer patients, which could not be ascribed to alteration in body composition. The results may, in part, explain the mechanisms behind ongoing tissue breakdown in progressive cancer disease.\r"

Controversy exists regarding the etiology of this complication. Suggested causative factors include the type and extent of the valvular disease, type and size of the prosthesis, and the surgical techniques used. Our experience over a 20-year period includes 10 patients with rupture of the left ventricle following mitral valve replacement. In all patients, both mitral leaflets were excised together with the attached chordae. Three patients survived after repair of the rupture. Repair consisted of compressing the area between the left atrium and the base of the papillary muscle using two strips of Teflon and deep mattress sutures passed beneath the coronary vessels in the atrioventricular groove. Since 1983 we have routinely preserved the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with its attached chordae to maintain a \"tethered loop\" between the mitral valve and ventricle. No further ruptures have occurred. The technique used for repair represents reconstitution of the divided loop between the ventricle and the mitral valve.\r"

Analysis examined the predictive value of presenting symptoms and diagnostic screening results for pathological Stage III or IV disease (advanced) and survival. The lesion presented as a peripheral mass in 121 patients (59%) and as an infiltrate in 84 (41%). Follow-up data were available on 199 patients (97%). Variables analyzed included indices of background or risk factors, presenting symptoms, diagnostic test results, and clinical management. Seventy-nine patients (39%) had a histological diagnosis of advanced disease by TMN staging criteria. Of the 152 deaths (74%), 117 (77%) were related to the pulmonary carcinoma. Univariate analysis associated short-term and long-term anorexia, weight loss, generalized weakness, and profound dyspnea with advanced disease and ultimately with death due to cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analyses suggested that weight loss and dyspnea disclosed independent information about the likelihood of advanced disease for this population (p less than 0.0003). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses of survival revealed a significant association between weight loss and death due to alveolar cell carcinoma after pathological stage was taken into account (p = 0.001). In this series, the 80 patients with Stage I disease had the best prognosis (5-year survival of 55%). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients having wedge resection (N = 17) and those having lobectomy (N = 63) for Stage I disease.\r"

Marlex mesh was used for flat surfaces, and Marlex mesh with methyl methacrylate was used for the sternum and the curved surface of the lateral chest wall. These results have allowed an expansion of the indications for chest wall resection to include the curative treatment of primary chest wall tumors and palliative treatment for breast cancer patients with osteoradionecrosis, local recurrence (in select patients), chest wall infection, and tumors metastatic to the chest wall.\r"

Antireflux procedures consisted of the following: six Belsey Mark IV, two Collis-Belsey, three Nissen, and one Collis-Nissen. Reflux esophagitis recurred in all patients at an average of 4 years postoperatively. Esophageal strictures were severe in 3 patients and necessitated partial esophagectomy and short-segment colon interposition. These patients had been on a regimen of long-standing high-dose steroid therapy, and none showed any wound healing problems or postoperative leaks. There was 1 death, which occurred fifteen days postoperatively as a result of pulmonary complications. Control of reflux and dysphagia can be achieved with antireflux procedures, but in our experience, all will ultimately fail in time. We believe esophageal replacement should be considered as the initial step in treatment of strictures of the esophagus in patients with scleroderma.\r"

  ".W": "Rupture of a congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. Between 1956 and 1971, we operated on 14 patients aged 9 to 36 years (median, 20 years) for repair of a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva, and have followed each patient to the present. Two operative and 4 late deaths occurred, 3 following a second cardiac operation and the other from dysrhythmia. Late complications have included development of complete heart block in 2 patients (necessitating permanent pacemaker insertion 11 and 24 years after initial repair), progression of aortic regurgitation in 2 (necessitating valve replacement 9 and 13 years after initial repair), and endocarditis in 1 patient 20 years after repair. Four of the 8 remaining long-term survivors (followed for 15 to 30 years [mean, 23.6 years]) are in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, and the other 4 are in NYHA Class II. Three of the 5 patients with suture closure (no pledgets or adjacent ventricular septal defect repair) of the ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva sustained recurrent rupture and required repeat closure. Whether the lack of prosthetic material to bolster the repair or inadequate resection of redundant aneurysmal fibrous tissue was responsible for these recurrences cannot be stated. Operative management of patients with ruptured congenital aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva is discussed.\r"

Twenty-five patients (81%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class III or IV. Coexistent cardiac anomalies included a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in 16 patients (52%) and aortic valve regurgitation in 12 patients (39%). The ruptured SVA originated from the right coronary sinus in 29 patients (94%) and the noncoronary sinus in 2 patients (6%), and drained into the right ventricle in 30 patients (97%). In 6 patients treated recently, we used patches to repair the ruptured SVA and VSD through a double approach, thereby avoiding a ventriculotomy. This method resulted in no recurrent rupture or residual VSD postoperatively. There was one operative death (3%) and 4 late deaths (13%). Of the 26 surviving patients, 22 (85%) were in NYHA Class I at follow-up ranging from 6 months to 26.7 years (mean, 11.1 years). Actuarial survival at 25 years is 85.6 +/- 7.4% (mean +/- standard deviation). Repair of ruptured SVA with a patch through a double approach provides an excellent operative procedure and offers a long-term outcome.\r"

There were no signs of valvular stenosis, exuberant peel formation, or calcification of the conduit in any of the patients. To date, there has been no need to replace any of the porcine-valved conduits. Cumulative survival (including hospital deaths) is 71% at 10 years. In conclusion, we believe that the porcine-valved conduits have functioned very satisfactorily over time.\r"

In addition, local myocardial temperatures were monitored to determine their utility in the intraoperative determination of the extent of cryothermic cell death. Cryolesion volume was significantly affected by both the initial myocardial temperature (p less than 0.001) and the line pressure (p = 0.014). In a 37 degrees C myocardium, the mean lesion volume ranged from 0.501 +/- 0.183 cc at line pressures lower than 700 psi to 0.839 +/- 0.258 cc at line pressures greater than 700 psi. In a 12 degrees C myocardium, the mean volume was 1.151 +/- 0.436 cc at line pressures lower than 700 psi and 1.361 +/- 0.288 cc at line pressures higher than 700 psi. A myocardial temperature of 0 degrees C occurs at the edge of the area of cell death. When analyzing the range from -5 degrees to +5 degrees C, the probability of a point at or lower than 0 degrees C falling inside the cryolesion is 84.2%. Monitoring intramyocardial temperature will predict the border of a cryolesion.\r"

Major associated procedures and preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes IV and V influenced hospital mortality significantly. The mean follow-up was 2.6 +/- 1.3 years. Late mortality was 5.9%. Overall actuarial survival was 81% at 5 years. A chief cause of reoperation was cusp rupture of a mitral prosthesis in 5 patients (all after aortic and mitral valve replacement). The overall actuarial reoperation-free incidence was 93% at 5 years. Thromboembolic (TB) phenomena occurred at a linear incidence of 1.4 +/- 0.3% per patient-year or an actuarial thromboembolism-free incidence of 92% at 5 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that postoperative NYHA Class, rhythm at follow-up, and anticoagulant therapy significantly influenced the incidence of TE phenomena.\r"

Forty patients were followed up and underwent the same investigations 10 +/- 4 months after operation. At baseline, regional RV dysfunction was observed in 89% of the patients whereas global RV dysfunction was present in approximately a third. After operation, no changes in RV regional dysfunction or RV pressures were observed. However, a significant increase in RV end-diastolic (p less than 0.03) and end-systolic volume indices (p less than 0.02) along with a significant decrease in resting and exercise RV ejection fractions (p less than 0.05) was found. We were unable to demonstrate any significant relationship between preoperative RV dysfunction and surgical outcome. We conclude that RV dysfunction is common in patients with LV aneurysm. Current techniques of operative intervention for this type of aneurysm seem to be followed by RV dilatation and impairment in RV function.\r"

The mean ages of Groups 2, 3, and 4 were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than the mean age of Group 1. The predicted postoperative lung function (F) was assessed by the formula F = [1-(b-n)/(42-n)] x f, where f is the preoperative vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in one second, b is the number of subsegments of the resected lung lobe, and n is the number of subsegments obstructed by the tumor, which was assessed by the findings on the chest tomogram, on the bronchogram, at bronchofiberscopy, or a combination of these. The total number of subsegments was assumed to be 42. The predicted postoperative % FEV1 was 65.1 +/- 19.3% in Group 1,55.3 +/- 10.6% in Group 2,37.6 +/- 12.1% in Group 3, and 42.3 +/- 18.4% in Group 4. It was significantly (p less than 0.05) different between all the groups except between Groups 3 and 4. All 10 patients with a predicted postoperative % FEV1 of less than 30% were in Groups 3 and 4. We conclude that special attention to postoperative management is needed for patients whose predicted postoperative %FEV1 is lower than 30%.\r"

  ".W": "With the increasing application of arrhythmia surgery, intraoperative electrophysiological study is done frequently, although its potential to cause acute depression of cardiac function remains unresolved. This study examines the acute effects of simulated electrophysiological testing on left ventricular function. Seven dogs were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and instrumented for measurement of heart rate, mean aortic pressure, cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Systolic pressure-dimension work loops were analyzed over varying preloads. Contractility was assessed from the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship (Ees) and from preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW). After the collection of control data, electrophysiological testing was simulated by pacing at 200 beats per minute for 30 seconds, fibrillating for 15 seconds, and finally defibrillating with a 10-J countershock. Data were recorded after 3 and 6 simulations of ventricular fibrillation (VF3, VF6). Mean heart rate and mean aortic pressure did not vary significantly during the course of the experiment. CO decreased from a control value of 2.7 +/- 0.2 L/min (+/- the standard error of the mean) to 2.0 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05) after VF3 and remained significantly depressed after VF6. SVR increased from a control value of 3,231 +/- 211 dyne sec cm-5 to 3,976 +/- 305 dyne sec cm-5 after VF3 (p = not significant) and increased further to 4,774 +/- 442 dyne sec cm-5 after VF6 (p less than 0.05). Neither Ees nor PRSW varied significantly even after 6 EP simulations, thereby indicating that contractility was unchanged during the experiment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An algorithm that provides quality care and a rational basis for timely surgical intervention would be advantageous. We report our five-year experience with EMP in substance abuse patients and present such a treatment plan. Sixty-one substance abuse patients were treated for EMP. Posteroanterior, lateral, and decubitus x-ray studies were obtained before treatment to assess fluid movement. Chest tubes were placed to drain frank pus and to obtain material for positive smears. X-ray studies and computed tomography were done 24 hours later to assess parenchymal pathology and to detect any multiple loculations. Thirty-three substance abuse patients recovered following initial tube thoracostomy and 7 after a second chest tube was introduced. Twenty-one had multiple loculations and underwent thoracotomy. Twenty of the 21 required extensive debridement or decortication, or both; 2 required lobectomy and 1 pneumonectomy. Chest tubes were removed on an average of 6 +/- 1.5 days. Average postoperative stay was 10.7 +/- 2 days. There were 2 early deaths and 1 late death and no recurrent EMP. Bacteriology findings were nonspecific and often polymicrobial. We conclude that early thoracotomy can be lifesaving in the presence of a benign clinical course.\r"

Therefore, we used a questionnaire to gather information on experience with use of pericardial substitutes and to document the findings at reoperation. A six-question survey was sent to 2,344 members of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, requesting surgeons to list their experience with pericardial substitutes and at reoperation in patients with these substitutes in place. Of the 634 surgeons who responded to the survey, 120 reported the insertion of 3,828 pericardial substitutes. Two hundred thirty-six reoperations were reported by 89 surgeons. None of the pericardial substitutes was reported to be completely successful in facilitating reoperation. The experience with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pericardial substitutes was reported to be significantly more satisfactory than that with all other substitutes (p = 0.0004 by chi-square analysis), but 14% of surgeons who used PTFE said they were dissatisfied at reoperation. Based on the results of this survey, we suggest caution, careful documentation, and long-term follow-up studies before widespread use of pericardial substitutes can be recommended.\r"

Preventive measures include modifications in operative techniques, containing pressure-volume work by the left ventricle, and probably retention of the posterior mitral leaflet. Surgical repair of the rupture with and without the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in 50% and 7% survival, respectively. With the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, external repair was followed by a 67% survival and the internal approach, by a 27% survival.\r"

  ".W": "The antihypertensive efficacy and renal effects of enalapril maleate therapy were evaluated in 13 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure. Enalapril was administered as follows: alone; added to furosemide, clonidine hydrochloride, or atenolol; or in combination with any of the aforementioned drugs. Three patients did not complete the study; uncontrolled hypertension was the cause in two of these patients. In the remaining ten patients, short-term (mean +/- SD, 63 +/- 9 days) enalapril maleate therapy decreased the patient's seated blood pressure from 161/98 +/- 19/8 to 130/80 +/- 13/7 mm Hg. Furosemide was administered to eight patients; the dose of concomitant sympatholytic therapy was decreased in five of five patients. Serum potassium concentration increased from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L. Levels of urinary total protein excretion decreased from 2.23 +/- 2.05 to 1.08 +/- 1.45 g/d. Renal function (creatinine clearance, 0.58 +/- 0.21 mL/s) did not change from baseline. During long-term therapy, the rate of progression of renal insufficiency seemed to slacken in three of four patients with diabetic nephropathy. Thus enalapril can reduce blood pressure and proteinuria in hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The possibility that enalapril can slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy remains to be confirmed by future studies.\r"

Forty-three non-insulin-dependent diabetic men were compared with 41 male nondiabetic age-matched controls. The diabetic patients were significantly inferior to the control group in the serial learning task and Benton's Visual Retention Test. The digit span test showed no difference between the groups. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-frequency-band analysis revealed slowing over the central cortex and reduction of alpha activity over the parietal area in diabetic patients. Acute hyperglycemia induced in healthy volunteers with the administration of 50 g of intravenous glucose did not have any effect on the dominant EEG rhythms. The checkerboard elicited P100 wave did not reveal a significant increase in latency nor were the P300 wave latencies significantly different in diabetic patients. However, a trend toward longer latencies in diabetics was evident at Fz and Cz recording sites. Acute hyperglycemia in healthy volunteers did not alter the P300 wave component. The results indicate that elderly type 2 diabetic patients have an impairment in retrieval of recently learned material with preservation of auditory attention and immediate recall. The EEG data suggest that there may be some central neural pathologic condition associated with diabetes.\r"

We reviewed the course of 244 patients who died during two three-month periods, in 1982 and 1986. We found that 68% of patients who died had a DNR order written, including 94% with malignancy and half of patients with cardiovascular disease. Most orders (61%) were written within three days of death, with 64% written on medical-surgical floors and 34% in critical care units. Even among patients under the age of 60 years, 57% had a DNR order written by the time of death. Ninety-one percent of DNR orders were written by attending physicians, with accompanying explanatory note in 84%. Documentation showed only 14% of patients but 77% of families being consulted. In 1983 a new two-level DNR order system defined two levels of intensity: \"all but cardiopulmonary resuscitation\" and \"comfort measures only.\" Equal numbers of patients received each order in the 1986 sample. No patient was transferred to the critical care units after a DNR order had been written. The prevalence of DNR orders written for patients dying of cardiovascular disease increased from 27% to 64% over the four years. We conclude, from study of deaths in this representative community hospital, that an explicit DNR order is now the rule rather than the exception, but decisions are made late and involve family far more than the patient.\r"

An abnormal AmECG was defined by second-degree or greater AV block or by Lown grade 3 or greater ventricular ectopy. The incidence of cardiac mortality or an abnormal AmECG was not influenced by hypokalemia or beta-blockers. Digitalis was associated with both an abnormal AmECG and a twofold increase in mortality whether or not the AmECG was normal. Cardiac mortality accounted for 26 of 33 deaths within the first year after the AmECG. In the absence of coronary artery disease, survival at six months was 100% in patients with normal AmECG vs 90% (abnormal AmECG). In the presence of coronary artery disease, survival at six months was 83% (normal AmECG) vs 54% (abnormal AmECG).\r"

However, recent changes in societal perceptions about environmental risks, corporate health care practices, and medical reimbursement patterns favoring provision by hospitals of contractual outpatient services to healthy workers all portend expanded involvement of residents in certain occupational medicine activities in the future, in response to economic pressures on both consumers and providers. These same forces may, unfortunately, undermine the scientific and ethical quality of such training experiences, compared with emerging, more academically motivated approaches. The implications of these prospects are analyzed in the hope that a proper balance can ultimately be struck between economic and academic imperatives.\r"

Respondents who reported having a personal MD (44% MDs, 74% non-MDs) were twice as likely to believe they should visit a physician regularly for health maintenance and three times as likely to actually visit a physician for health maintenance as those respondents without a personal physician. Both MDs and non-MDs described the need to visit the doctor more often than they actually reported doing so for health maintenance. However, MDs more often than non-MDs reported receiving the particular health maintenance procedures that are generally considered to constitute essential health maintenance care. A better understanding of health maintenance care by MDs and their non-MD colleagues provides insights into the use and misuse of clinical procedures in the asymptomatic adult.\r"

Within this study, we evaluated whether benzodiazepine sedative use was associated with risk of falling. The mean age (+/- SD) of the cohort was 79.8 +/- 7.3 years, and 80% were women. Monthly telephone interviews yielded a total of 77 falls during an average follow-up time of 5.6 months. Benzodiazepine use at baseline was categorized as either none, as needed, or continuous, eg, nightly use. Continuous use appeared to increase the risk of falling in this cohort (unadjusted relative risk [RR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.93, 2.52; RR adjusted for age, gender, and follow-up time = 1.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.92, 3.62). Any use of benzodiazepines was related to multiple falls in persons who fell. The risk of falling from continuous benzodiazepine use may be higher in persons with position-sense loss in the toes (RR = 2.00) than in persons without such loss (RR = 1.35). We suggest that periodic review of the need for benzodiazepines in the elderly be made.\r"

Subjects were actively employed health workers between 20 and 64 years of age without active tuberculosis. All subjects were tested using 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative via the Mantoux technique. Induration was quantitated by trained readers at 24 hours and at 48 to 72 hours. Patients were asked to read their own tests as well at 48 to 72 hours. The amount of induration at 24 hours was highly predictive of eventual findings at 48 to 72 hours. The patients' abilities to read their own tests were poor. Significant differences were noted between the pen and palpation methods. The degree of induration noted 24 hours after placement of 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative is valuable in a screening population. Most decisions, however, should still be based on results measured at 48 to 72 hours. Results with the pen technique must be interpreted with caution in the 5- to 14-mm range. The patients' readings of their own results are inaccurate and should never be relied on to make clinical decisions.\r"

All vegetations were large (greater than or equal to 1 cm) (mean maximal dimension, 1.7 +/- 0.5 cm). Medical cure was achieved in all 16 patients without vegetations and in 18 (90%) of 20 patients with tricuspid valve vegetations. One patient with tricuspid vegetation and polymicrobial infection died of respiratory failure. Surgery was required for one patient with tricuspid vegetation, all three patients with isolated left-sided endocarditis, and two of four patients with multivalve involvement. Short-term changes of tricuspid valve vegetations during therapy (one to eight weeks) did not correlate with clinical outcome. Although large tricuspid vegetations may occasionally identify a subset at risk for complications, most patients with isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis have a benign prognosis.\r"

Unfortunately, due to adverse reactions to sulfonamides, many patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are unable to receive a complete course of therapy. The promising results with clindamycin phosphate therapy in a mouse model of TE prompted us to seek further information about patients with AIDS with TE who had been treated with clindamycin. Fifteen such patients were identified in whom clindamycin was used to treat 18 episodes of TE. Eleven patients showed clinical or radiologic improvement after receiving clindamycin therapy, either alone or in combination with pyrimethamine. Twelve received oral clindamycin as suppressive therapy after discharge from the hospital. Adverse reactions possibly related to clindamycin therapy included diarrhea, reversible granulocytopenia, and skin reactions. The results of this retrospective study suggest that clindamycin, either alone or in combination with pyrimethamine, may represent an effective alternative therapy for TE in patients with AIDS. Whether this supposition can be substantiated by appropriately designed studies is presently being determined.\r"

In an attempt to circumvent these drawbacks, 55 patients with cardiovascular disease were given low-dose long-acting niacin, 1 g/d. Treatment was continued for a mean of 6.7 months and lipid values were compared with a non-treated group of 17 patients followed for a mean of 6.3 months. Lipid values did not change in the nontreated group. In the niacin-treated group total cholesterol and triglyceride levels also did not significantly change. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level rose 31% from 1.01 +/- 0.31 mmol/L to 1.32 +/- 0.31 mmol/L and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was reduced 27% from 6.4 +/- 1.9 to 4.7 +/- 1.3. Despite these results, 40% of the patients left the study mainly because of side effects. Apart from one patient who developed overt diabetes, of questionable relationship to niacin, no patient developed serious side effects such as jaundice or peptic ulcer as seen with much higher doses of the drug. Although often difficult to administer to patients, niacin, particularly in low dose, deserves consideration as an inexpensive agent especially useful for elevating HDL cholesterol level and altering the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio.\r"

An adenoma was identified and removed in both patients. Persistence of hypercortisolism characterized the response of patient 2 to surgery; transient hypoadrenalism, the response of patient 1. Patient 1 subsequently underwent a relapse. At the second surgery (total hypophysectomy for both patients), hyperplasia was demonstrated in patient 1, and scattered nests of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting cells were demonstrated in patient 2. Postoperatively, Cushing's syndrome persisted in both patients. Inferior petrosal sampling for ACTH during corticotropin releasing hormone stimulation verified a pituitary source of ACTH in patient 1. A decrease in cortisol secretion following hypophysectomy and subsequent cure by pituitary irradiation constitutes the evidence for pituitary origin in patient 2. Dexamethasone suppression and corticotropin releasing hormone-stimulation tests consistently suggested a pituitary cause throughout the clinical course of both patients. Computed tomographic scans after hypophysectomy revealed postoperative changes only. In both patients, panhypopituitarism, except for cortisol and ACTH, followed hypophysectomy. It may be concluded that patients with diffuse pituitary ACTH hyperplasia cannot, at present, be identified preoperatively by conventional clinical testing. Surgery for such patients may not be the therapy of choice.\r"

For the other indications, half to three fourths of the patients improved with splenectomy. An increased incidence of excessive hemorrhage, infected hematoma, and early mortality was more common in the PPMM group and was found to be connected with large spleens, prolonged bleeding time, and prominent thrombocytopenia. Persistent thrombocytosis after surgery was more common in the AMM group. Leukemic transformation seemed to be related to thrombocytosis and to prior therapy with alkylating agents. Median survival following splenectomy was 43 months in the AMM group and 32 months in the PPMM group. We conclude that splenectomy has a role in improving the quality of life by ameliorating mechanical discomfort and decreasing transfusion requirement in the late phase of AMM. However, in patients with PPMM, because of the high complication rate, splenectomy should be carefully considered for specific indications on an individual basis.\r"

Of 94 (47%) respondents who used computers, 77 (82%) used them for administrative purposes; 74 (79%), for any routine processing of surgical specimens; 43 (45%), for processing surgical specimens other than word processing (eg, database); 52 (55%), for processing cytology specimens; and 60 (63%), for processing autopsy specimens (including word processing). Computer use was slightly greater with higher work loads. Among nonusers, on a scale of 1 to 5 the average interest in using computers was 3.5 for surgical pathology data, 3.4 for cytology data, and 2.8 for autopsy data. The interest rate also increased with work load, and was nearly 4 for laboratories with greater than 4000 surgical or cytology cases per year. The average interest in controlling and/or making decisions about computer hardware and software was 3.9 for hardware and 4 for software. Reasons for low computer use in anatomic pathology despite interest in utilization are discussed, including the limited selection of affordable commercial software for anatomic pathology and difficulties of in-house software development.\r"

Using data from death certificates, verified by hospital records, autopsy rates for various diseases and causes of death were examined in persons aged 25 to 44 years, which represents the age group with the majority of AIDS deaths. The hospital autopsy rate for those patients dying of AIDS dropped from 46% in 1982 to 17% in 1986, while the rate for non-AIDS autopsies went from 23% in 1982 to 15% in 1986. These declines have occurred despite the continued presence of a major epidemic in which the pathophysiology is still under active investigation. The low autopsy rate for patients with AIDS is of concern to both epidemiologists and clinical researchers: the autopsy is vital to a better understanding of the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

Several lymph nodes are embedded in the parotid gland, other lymph nodes are adjacent to the submaxillary gland, and ectopic salivary gland acini and ducts are commonly present in cervical lymph nodes. These salivary gland lymph nodes may become the primary site of the benign lymphadenopathy and the malignant lymphomas characteristically associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This report of a series of HIV-associated lymphatic lesions originating in salivary gland lymph nodes comprises nine cases of salivary gland masses that were surgically excised, it includes six cases of lymphadenitides and three cases of lymphoma--all originating in salivary gland lymph nodes and showing the histologic lesions known to occur in association with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The HIV-related infections and neoplasias located in the salivary gland lymph nodes raise interesting questions about the possible etiologic role of an oral portal of entry and of the virus-infected saliva. The recognition of their clinical and pathologic features is indispensable to enable correct diagnosis and treatment.\r"

In six cases the infection was identified outside of the central nervous system and in only two cases was infection disseminated to multiple extracerebral organs. Review of clinical history and laboratory data revealed no specific risk factors or laboratory indicators associated with toxoplasmosis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Though inflammatory cell infiltrates often accompanied disseminated infections, diagnosis could be made with certainty only by finding characteristic Toxoplasma organisms, either as free tachyzoites, pseudocysts, or as true parasitic cysts. We found immunohistochemical staining to have limited usefulness for diagnosis in extracerebral sites. Characteristic Toxoplasma organisms were most readily identified in central nervous system tissues in our acquired immunodeficiency syndrome population, making this the most useful site for diagnosis.\r"

Peak torque values were recorded at low (60 degrees/sec) and high (180 degrees/sec) speed of isokinetic movement, and the maximal isometric extension and flexion outputs were measured at the knee angle of 60 degrees from straight. Three standardized knee scoring scales were used to determine the subjective, functional, clinical, and radiologic outcomes of these LCL insufficient knees. In every test a great interpersonal variation of the HQ ratios was noticed, even in the healthy knees (range 24% to 154%). On the injured side the HQ ratios were in every test higher than on the healthy side, because of the weaker quadriceps muscle of the injured leg. In most cases, followup scores did not differ significantly between the groups with low (less than 50%), optimal (50% to 80%), or high (greater than 80%) HQ ratios of the LCL insufficient knees. However, in every test the scores were significantly (p less than 0.005 to 0.0001) better in the patients who had the HQ ratio of the injured knee near the uninjured side (less than 15%) compared with those with a clear difference (greater than 15%). These findings suggest that the HQ ratio is a very individual parameter, and therefore any general recommendation about the optimal value is very difficult to give. With regard to long-term outcome, the most ideal HQ ratio of an LCL insufficient knee seems to be the HQ ratio of the opposite, healthy extremity.\r"

  ".W": "Many rehabilitation patients have cardiovascular disease as a primary or secondary diagnosis. Such patients require careful evaluation before institution of vigorous therapeutic exercise and activity regimens. However, conventional exercise tests are often inappropriate due to orthopedic, neurologic, or functional limitations. This article introduces a new method of cardiac assessment, called the Trendscriber Evaluation (TE). The TE uses the Trendscriber, a cardiac telemetry unit which provides a hard-copy single-lead electrocardiogram (SECG) printout and digital heart rate monitor. The TE was developed to assess SECG, hemodynamic, and symptomatic responses during preestablished submaximal levels of activity. Specially trained physical and occupational therapists conduct the evaluation, directing the patient and monitoring vital signs. Results are interpreted by a staff cardiologist. For two years this technique was evaluated for 100 patients in the form of a medical records review. Eighty-nine percent of the patients' TEs identified cardiac abnormalities with heart rhythms, hemodynamic response, or both. Arrhythmia activity not detected on the routine 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded in 49.5% of the TEs performed. Fifty-seven percent of the records revealed activity-related ventricular ectopic activity. Data uncovered by the TE resulted in alteration of medical and/or rehabilitation therapy in 63% of the patients. The review suggests that the TE is a valuable tool in identifying problems related to cardiovascular performance and in providing the health care team with information important for patient management.\r"

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that both peak heart rate (HR) and rate pressure product (RPP) increased significantly with increases in cranking rate across the three tests (p less than .05). Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) and oxygen uptake (VO2) for the 60- and 70- rpm tests was significantly higher than for the 30-rpm test (p less than .05). Peak work rate (WR) was significantly higher for the 70-rpm than for the 30-rpm test (p less than .05). Because RPP is an accepted index of myocardial oxygen consumption, the results indicated that the metabolic load on the heart was increased by increments in the cranking rate. The increases in RPP occurred as a function of the combined increases in HR and SBP as rpm increased from 60 to 70. Since increases in WR and VO2 did not occur as rpm increased from 60 to 70, the rise in HR and RPP may have occurred in response to factors other than the total-body oxygen demand.\r"

Forty-one controls (20 boys and 21 girls) ambulated at a comfortable pace; 16 children (eight boys and eight girls) with lower extremity poliomyelitis of varying severity ambulated by (1) wheelchair propulsion, (2) bilateral axillary crutches, (3) unilateral lower extremity ankle-foot orthoses or knee-ankle-foot orthoses, and (4) unassisted. Disabled children, regardless of their mode of ambulation, had to expend significantly more energy to ambulate than normal children (p less than 0.05). Wheelchair propulsion cost 16% more energy than the normal gait; crutch ambulation cost 41% more than the control. Children using unilateral braces sacrificed speed to attain near-normal Ee. When they ambulated without orthoses, their Ee increased by 109% over the control. In ascending order, the least energy was expanded by normal ambulation followed by disabled ambulation with unilateral brace, disabled propelling a wheelchair, disabled ambulation with bilateral axillary crutches, and disabled ambulation without brace. Efficiency of locomotion was reflected in the values obtained for Ee in terms of kcal x 10(-3)/kg/m, as demonstrated by the lower Ee but slower ambulation of children with braces, as compared to the nondisabled children.\r"

Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured in 19 healthy young men (means = 20.31 years) in seven positions: (1) standing passive (STD), (2) inverted passive (INV), (3) standing recovery postpassive inversion (SRPI), (4) standing exercise (SDE), (5) standing recovery poststanding exercise (SRPSE), (6) inverted exercise (INVE), and (7) inverted recovery postinverted exercise (IRPIE). Ten of the subjects participated in a five-week inversion training program, after which all 19 subjects were retested. Compared to STD, INV elicited significant increases in SBP/DBP and a significant decrease in HR. The average INV blood pressure was 146/97 mmHg, which was further increased during INVE to 158/101 mmHg. These responses increase the workload of the heart and may be dangerous to some populations. No physiologic adaptations occurred in any of the inverted positions as a result of inversion training. Gravity inversion should not be compared to or classified as an exercise. Some previously suggested inverted exercises are not recommended. Because of the nature of the responses, medical screening before the use of inversion devices is critical.\r"

Differences in shoot segment responses were determined by stimulating the ulnar nerve at 2-cm intervals across the elbow in 20 normal adults. Thirteen ulnar nerves on the left side and 12 nerves on the right of 14 men and six women were studied for motor nerve conduction velocity. The amplitudes of the hypothenar compound muscle action potentials and the conduction times after supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve were also determined. The distal-to-proximal reduction in the amplitude of the potentials was 6% on the left and 4.2% on the right. The maximum conduction time in a 2-cm segment on the right side was 0.63msec (mean +2SD = 0.43 + 0.20) and on the left, 0.60msec (mean +2SD = 0.44 + 0.16). Using the same short segment stimulation technique, ulnar nerve motor conduction was also studied in 13 patients with suspected ulnar neuropathy at the elbow in order to localize the nerve lesion. Conduction time only was abnormal in one patient, both conduction time and amplitude in nine, amplitude only in one, and conduction time and mild reduction in amplitude in two. It was concluded that short segment stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the elbow is useful in localizing the exact site of entrapment/compression of the nerve at the elbow.\r"

The case of a 25-year-old man with C8 complete quadriplegia, who developed a syrinx five years after his initial injury, is presented. This patient kept a log of his daily physical workout which consisted of lifting weights of 50 to 60 pounds with his neck extensors and biceps. The diagnosis was made clinically and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Repeated valsalva maneuvers from daily heavy weightlifting exercises most likely predisposed this patient to the development and extension of his syringomyelia. Dramatic improvement followed surgical placement of a subarachnoid shunt.\r"

Orthopnea out of proportion to the underlying cardiopulmonary status and thoracoabdominal paradoxus in the supine position are the clues to the diagnosis. Pulmonary function tests showed a typical restrictive ventilatory defect, and arterial blood gas showed chronic respiratory acidosis. Failure to recognize the diaphragmatic impairment led to cardiopulmonary decompensations such as cor pulmonale and acute respiratory failure. However, with the institution of appropriate therapy, adverse effects resolved and all five patients are alive and continue to lead independent lives. We conclude that nontrauma-related bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed condition. The results also indicate that early diagnosis and treatment can minimize morbidity and mortality, and that excellent long-term, good-quality survival can be expected.\r"

Bypass caused no significant elevation in peripheral venous white blood cell counts. Higher counts were present in the right atrium compared with the left atrium. Patients who underwent bypass had elevated complement component and prostacyclin concentrations before operation and these levels increased further during operation. Trapping of polymorphonuclear leukocytes occurred in pulmonary alveolar capillaries and venules after bypass. We conclude that bypass activates complement components primarily of the alternative pathway and leads to increased blood prostacyclin levels. These changes are accompanied by polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in the lungs and may be important in initiation of the adult respiratory distress syndrome in these patients.\r"

Previous studies of the functional changes induced by this process have produced variable results. We compared neutrophils isolated from blood and from subcutaneous wounds in rabbits using established assays for adherence, chemotaxis, superoxide anion production, and hydrogen peroxide production. No differences in adherence to biologic surfaces or chemotaxis toward activated plasma were found. However, our results confirm the observation that wound neutrophils are \"primed\" for increased production of oxygen radicals. Primed responses were observed for both soluble (formyl methionyl leucylphenylalanine, phorbol myristate acetate) and particulate (opsonized zymosan) stimulants. Priming was also observed for peritoneal exudate neutrophils. The data suggest that the process of extravascular migration includes priming of the superoxide generating system.\r"

In contrast, these groups were similar with respect to other clinical features and indexes of global severity of dementia. A logistic regression model that included the degenerative features of both the locus ceruleus and the substantia nigra was significantly better at predicting the presence of major depression than those employing the characteristics of either pigmented nucleus alone.

In patients with Parkinson's disease, the additional central processing time required for more complex situations was no different from that in control subjects, suggesting that cognitive aspects of the reaction time procedures tested were possibly too simple to reveal a slowing of thought processes in these patients. Conversely, the central processing time was increased in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy compared with both Parkinson's disease and control subjects. The increase was associated with impairment in frontal lobe test performance. These results confirm that a slowing of central processing is a prominent feature of the cognitive disturbances of progressive supranuclear palsy and, furthermore, suggest that this slowing may be related to striatofrontal dysfunction.\r"

All nine boxers were medically suspended secondary to a knockout or excessive head blows. Neurologic examination results and MR scans were normal in all nine boxers. Failure to detect abnormalities on the MR scan, by neurologic examination, or both in these amateur boxers may reflect several factors, including a small sample size, the duration between their last bout and neurologic evaluation, and the lower exposure to head trauma among amateur boxers compared with professionals.\r"

Five of these patients had distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Nerve conduction velocities were normal and therefore indicative of pure axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed moderate loss of myelinated axons in two patients and severe loss in one. This patient also had necrotizing arteritis. The remaining two had both clinical and electrophysiologic signs of overlapping mononeuritis multiplex with severe denervation in the territory of the involved nerves, but normal conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy in one of these two patients showed marked loss of myelinated fibers and signs of vasculitis. Two types of neuropathy were noted: (1) a mild distal neuropathy with relatively minor neurologic deficit, probably due to vasa nervorum microcirculation occlusion caused by intravascular deposits of cryoglobulins and (2) a severe distal symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy or overlapping mononeuritis multiplex, associated with necrotizing vasculitis.\r"

The levorotatory form of 5-hydroxytryptophan significantly improved the ataxia score. It also significantly modified the time of standing upright, the spread of feet, the speed of walking, speaking, and writing. In five cases in which the levorotatory form of 5-hydroxytryptophan therapy was maintained for 12 months, the effect continued progressively.\r"

Forced vital capacity, MVV, and MEP correlated with Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status scores (tau = -0.72, -0.70, and -0.65) and expiratory muscle weakness occurred most frequently.

Pelvic floor descent was correlated with increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in both groups of patients. In the patients with double incontinence, there was a less significant correlation between perineal descent and increased perineal nerve terminal motor latency. In the patients with fecal incontinence, but without urinary incontinence, there was no correlation between perineal descent and perineal nerve terminal motor latency. These data support the concept that pelvic floor weakness can result in damage to the pudendal and perineal nerves, leading to fecal and urinary incontinence. In patients with isolated fecal incontinence the perineal nerves are relatively spared. Thus these common types of incontinence probably have a neurologic cause, and neurophysiologic methods can be used in their assessment.\r"

Serum concentrations of estrogen and progesterone parallel cerebrospinal concentrations, and circulating sex hormones are concentrated in specific areas of the brain that regulate sexual behavior. These centers include two potentially epileptogenic regions--the amygdala and hippocampus. Many of these structures are physiologically affected in vitro by estrogen and progesterone. Exogenous sex hormones change the seizure threshold in animal models of epilepsy. Cyclical hormonal variations may influence electroencephalographic activity and affect seizure frequency in women with epilepsy. Hormonal therapy may be appropriate adjunctive anticonvulsant treatment, particularly for women with seizures that are catamenial or associated with a menstrual or reproductive endocrine disorder.\r"

The focal nature of the auditory structures was confirmed by detailed neuropathologic data in one case and by magnetic resonance scans in the other one. In both cases, brain-stem auditory evoked potentials revealed the unilateral absence (case 1) or marked attenuation (case 2) of wave V on stimulation of the ear contralateral to the intrinsic pontine lesion. Findings in both cases strongly suggest that wave V is predominantly generated by pontine structures contralateral to the stimulated ear and that the integrity of the contralateral lateral lemniscus is essential.\r"

This revascularization could be mistaken for recurrent choroidal neovascularization because it initially proliferated into a glomerularlike structure and showed dye leakage on angiography. Unlike choroidal neovascularization, these vessels, however, filled entirely from the retinal circulation and stereoscopic angiograms showed them to be located in the inner retina. In the 20 patients who were followed up, the retinal revascularization first appeared approximately four weeks after treatment and persisted for an average of ten weeks. It was associated with dense laser scarring, retinal capillary obliteration, and internal limiting membrane wrinkling, suggesting that heavy initial laser treatment was a predisposing factor for its development. It is important to differentiate retinal revascularization, which has an excellent prognosis and does not require re-treatment, from recurrent choroidal neovascularization, which usually must be treated promptly to avoid loss in visual acuity.\r"

For a subgroup of 18 patients who had a two-year follow-up visit, the average chorioretinal scar expanded in area 50.1% per year for the first two years and 4.6% per year thereafter.

A poorly defined neovascular membrane was presumed to be present when subsensory retinal fluid was present in association with choroidal leakage on fluorescein angiography and in which the extent of leakage was not well defined. Among the 84 eyes, the average initial visual acuity was 20/80. In 75 (89%) of 84 eyes, the leakage involved the foveal center at initial presentation. At follow-up (average, 28 months; range, six to 53 months), the average visual acuity was 20/250; the final acuity declined at least three but less than six lines in 18 eyes (21%) and six or more lines in 35 eyes (42%). There was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of eyes that developed moderate or severe visual loss among eyes that progressed to disciform scarring compared with eyes that continued to manifest poorly defined leakage without evidence of scarring. Given that most severe visual loss associated with macular degeneration can be attributed to consequences of neovascular membranes and that many membranes associated with age-related macular degeneration are poorly defined, our study results support the possibility that poorly defined neovascular membranes represent a major cause of severe visual loss among the elderly in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of macular hole formation, focal electroretinograms (ERGs) were obtained from both eyes of 35 patients with a unilateral, idiopathic, full-thickness macular hole. Foveal cone ERG amplitude was significantly correlated with hole diameter at the initial visit. Twenty-six patients had normal foveal cone ERGs in the fellow eye at the baseline visit and for the duration of the study (mean follow-up, 35 months; range, 24 to 56 months). None of these eyes developed a macular hole. Seven eyes had significantly reduced foveal cone ERGs in the fellow eye, despite good visual acuity and a normal-appearing macula on the initial visit. Four of these eyes subsequently developed a full-thickness macular hole during follow-up (mean follow-up, 35 months; range, 25 to 46 months). Foveal ERG amplitude was significantly related to subsequent macular hole formation, suggesting that this test can provide an objective measure of macular function to help identify eyes at risk for macular hole formation.\r"

Postdilation binocular visual acuity using the patients' usual correction was measured first in the office and then outdoors, both with the patient's back to and the patient facing the sun, with and without the aid of postmydriatic sunglasses. Twelve percent experienced disabling photophobia even with the use of postmydriatic sunglasses, with 3% having significant objective visual loss defined as 20/50 or worse. No objective visual loss was found in 30 controls examined outdoors before dilation, without sunglasses. We recommend that patients who have experienced significant photophobia with dilation in the past, or who have never before undergone dilation, make arrangements for transportation after a dilated examination.\r"

With age, the connective tissue ground plate between ciliary muscle and ciliary processes thickens, while there is very little increase in connective tissue within the ciliary muscle. With age, the atropinized muscle becomes shorter and smaller in area while it remains unchanged in width and position. In pilocarpinized eyes, the ciliary muscle is shorter, narrower, smaller in longitudinal and total area (ie, more circular and compact), and positioned more anteriorly than in contralateral atropinized eyes. These contractile responses to pilocarpine diminish with age at a rate similar to that for accommodative decline. According to these topographic findings, physicians seeking the pathophysiologic characteristics of presbyopia, which occurs in humans and rhesus monkeys on a comparable relative time scale, should redirect their attention toward the ciliary muscle.\r"

As early as one hour after treatment, the endothelium of both preretinal and choroidal blood vessels was severely damaged or completely obliterated, and platelet aggregates occluded the vascular lumina. Occlusion of the preretinal and choroidal blood vessels persisted for up to three days; however, endothelial regeneration and reperfusion had occurred in both vascular beds by seven days. In addition, the retinal pigment epithelium and myelin wings suffered ischemic damage.

Progressively better results were seen in patients with some high school education, high school graduates, and patients with some college education. No differences in clinical status were seen among patients who had attended college, graduated from college, or had postgraduate education. Although patients seen at the Veterans Administration Medical Center had lower levels of formal education than those seen at a university clinic and private practices, trends in clinical status according to formal education level were similar in all three clinical settings. Differences in clinical status according to formal education level are not explained by age, sex, duration of disease, clinical setting, or multiple comparisons. Formal education level may identify an important marker of clinical status in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Of 260 individuals infected with S typhimurium for whom adequate data were obtained, 19 patients developed joint disease (7.3%). All were men; the mean age +/- SD was 39.3 +/- 1.6 years. Among the 16 patients for whom this information was available, the interval from the onset of diarrhea to the onset of joint pain was less than 7 days in 7, 8-21 days in 2, and greater than 21 days in 7. There was a significantly longer duration of diarrhea in those patients with joint disease (mean +/- SEM 15.2 +/- 2.6 days) than in those without complications (10.0 +/- 1.1 days) (P less than 0.01). The joint disease was monarticular in 3 patients and polyarticular in 16. The joints most commonly affected were the elbow (47%), wrist (47%), knee (42%), low back (32%), and shoulder (32%). Six of the 19 patients had at least 1 extraarticular feature: ocular (5 patients), mucosal (1 patient), urethral (2 patients), or cutaneous (1 patient). Of these 19 patients, 11 were located and agreed to HLA typing. Four were positive for HLA-B27, 6 were HLA-B7 positive, and 1 had HLA-Bw60. Of the 4 B27 positive patients, 3 were DR1 positive; of the 6 B7 positive patients, 5 were DR2 positive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinically, peripheral joints were inflamed initially, then became ankylosed in a predictable sequence from distal to proximal. Forefeet were involved before hindfeet. Axial joint involvement produced severe spinal ankylosis. Extraarticular manifestations included balanitis and crusting skin lesions. Radiographically, bony erosions and calcification of articular and periarticular tissues were extensive, and vertebral syndesmophytes produced a \"bamboo\" spine. We conclude that progressive ankylosis is a systemic disease with many clinical and radiographic similarities to human spondylarthropathies, and it may represent a useful animal model for the study of the human diseases.\r"

It has been demonstrated by Mundy and Panje that a free flap placed on a large recipient bed and receiving nutrients through retrograde venous flow will survive as frequently as one in which a conventional microvascular anastomosis has been performed. Our groups examined (1) conventional microvascular anastomosis of the amputated appendage to establish survival and demonstrate proficiency with the technique; (2) survival when only venous egress is maintained; and (3) effectiveness of establishing nutrient flow through arterialization of the venous system. Nutrient flow in the first group was through the arterial system. In the second group no nutrient flow was established, but the venous system remained intact. In the last group, nutrient flow existed through retrograde venous profusion. Survival within the groups that underwent reestablishment of nutrient flow through a conventional reanastomosis or through arterialization of the venous system was not significantly different. There were no surviving segments if nutrient flow was not reestablished, but venous channels remained intact. It was shown that nutrient flow to a free-standing appendage can be established through retrograde venous profusion, and that maintenance of venous drainage alone is not sufficient for survival when a limited base exists. We suggest that arterialization of the venous system is a viable means of reestablishing nutrient flow to the amputated auricle.\r"

The authors presented findings that many of the physicians listed in the Yellow Pages, particularly under the heading of \"Plastic Surgery,\" were not board certified. The source data employed in that article were obtained and reexamined, and it was found that the assumptions used were inaccurate and the methodology flawed. Almost every physician listed under \"Plastic Surgery\" in the Yellow Pages is board certified. We discuss the conclusions of the original article and its recommendations for control of Yellow Pages listings.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed to objectively demonstrate the benefits of leeching a congested flap. Doppler laser perfusion monitoring (DLPM) was used to record blood flow changes in pig rump flaps compromised by venous occlusion. With the application of leeches to nine congested pig rump flaps, significant increases in blood flow were demonstrated both clinically and by DLPM. It is concluded from this study that DLPM can demonstrate objective improvement in microcirculatory perfusion with leeching.\r"

Agents that reduce the level of these free radicals have been used to improve flap survival in model systems. An in vitro study of the interactions between amino acids and hydroxyl radicals by electron spin resonance spectroscopy suggests an intrinsic radical scavenging activity of certain amino acids. The ability of these amino acids to improve acute axial-random skin flap survival was examined in a rat model. Cysteine, methionine, proline, hydroxyproline, histidine, and phenylalanine, given intravenously, significantly improved flap survival over saline controls; alanine gave an intermediate result, while aspartic acid showed no improvement. The in vitro data were generally a good predictor of free radical scavenging ability as manifested by improved flap survival in vivo. Biochemical mechanisms and clinical applications are described.\r"

This technique provides an expanded subglottic airway with minimal paratracheal dissection and does not require concomitant tracheotomy. We applied this procedure in managing extubation difficulty in pediatric as well as neonatal patients. Five of ten patients in our series did not fulfill the traditional criteria for ACS. Relief of stridor and avoidance of tracheotomy were accomplished in nine of ten patients. One patient in whom mechanical ventilation was reinstituted developed an interesting complication. In properly selected infants with subglottic airway compromise, the ACS appears to be an effective adjunct in facilitating extubation.\r"

In addition, nasal resistance, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate were determined before and after the olfactory tests. Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were obtained prior to testing. Although olfactory thresholds were equivalent in the two study groups, the MCS group evidenced significantly higher nasal resistances, respiration rates and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Decreases in systolic blood pressure and pulse were noted in both groups across the test sessions. These results do not support the hypothesis that MCS is associated with greater olfactory threshold sensitivity (at least to the two target chemicals), but do suggest that MCS is associated with depression, increased respiration rate, and decreased nasal airway patency.\r"

From 1964 to 1980, one-stage operations were carried out on 271 ears with sinus cholesteatomas. Follow-up included 90% of the patients, and the median observation time was 9.75 years. The recurrence rate was 10%. The recurrence rate was found to be independent of the mastoidectomy type employed. The best hearing results were obtained in ears with intact ossicular chain. We conclude that, wherever possible, sinus cholesteatoma should be removed through the auditory canal without mastoidectomy just as an intact ossicular chain should be preserved. \"Canal wall up\" and \"canal wall down\" appear to be equally valuable mastoidectomy types, and both methods must be employed to obtain optimum results.\r"

The perforation occupied the upper posterior quadrant of the TM. Alterations in healing rate and quality of the healed TM were examined by otomicroscopy and in histologic sections. Hyaluronan enhanced the healing rate and resulted in less opacity and structural alteration of the scar area. Closure time for the TM perforation was correlated to the concentration of hyaluronan but not to its molecular weight or viscosity. Improved scar quality was obtained in the presence of hyaluronan irrespective of its rheologic properties. Hyaluronan improved the restoration of the fibrous connective tissue layer. Treatment of TM perforation in man with hyaluronan at high concentrations should be considered as an alternative to myringoplasty.\r"

The test was performed in a pressure chamber designed for subatmospheric pressures, which enabled us to apply a negative middle ear pressure. In recumbent subjects, the hydrostatic effects of the body position and the negative pressure locked the tube. The subsequent pressure change was monitored by serial tympanometry. Despite a closed eustachian tube, a substantial capacity of reducing negative pressure was present. This capacity is not explained only by hydrostatic effects. The classical \"hydrops ex vacuo\" theory, which postulates a continuous gas absorption under the present conditions, is not consistent with our findings. Instead, they are in agreement with the view that the turnover of middle ear gas by diffusion is a bidirectional process that may even show a positive balance.\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of the measurement of changes in ST segment elevation was assessed as a non-invasive marker of coronary artery reperfusion after thrombolytic treatment. Forty five patients with acute myocardial infarction (23 anterior, 22 inferior) of less than six hours' duration were given thrombolytic treatment by either the intravenous (n = 28) or the intracoronary route (n = 17). A proportional value for the shift in ST segment, termed the fractional change, was calculated both from 12 lead electrocardiograms and from the Holter tape for each patient. Coronary artery patency in an initial group of 22 patients (training group) was associated with a fractional change value of greater than or equal to 0.5 (100% specific, 88% sensitive by Holter analysis; 100% specific, 94% sensitive by 12 lead electrocardiogram). This rule performed well when it was applied to a test group of 17 patients (100% specific, 93% sensitive by Holter analysis; and 67% specific, 93% sensitive by 12 lead electrocardiogram). Linear discriminant analysis was then used to determine which features gave the best separation of those in whom there was reperfusion and those in whom there was not. This gave 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity when applied to the training group for either the 12 lead electrocardiogram or Holter monitoring. When it was applied to the test group, the sensitivity was maintained at 100%, but the specificity dropped to 33% irrespective of whether the basis of the test was Holter monitoring or the 12 lead electrocardiogram.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty two patients (four men, 18 women, mean age 56 years, range 21 to 88 years) with a history of rheumatic mitral stenosis were studied by cross sectional echocardiography before and after balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. The appearance of the mitral valve on the pre-dilatation echocardiogram was scored for leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvar thickening, and calcification. Mitral valve area, left atrial volume, transmitral pressure difference, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, cardiac rhythm, New York Heart Association functional class, age, and sex were also studied. Because there was some increase in valve area in almost all patients the results were classified as optimal or suboptimal (final valve area less than 1.0 cm2, final left atrial pressure greater than 10 mm Hg, or final valve area less than 25% greater than the initial area). The best multiple logistic regression fit was found with the total echocardiographic score alone. A high score (advanced leaflet deformity) was associated with a suboptimal outcome while a low score (a mobile valve with limited thickening) was associated with an optimal outcome. No other haemodynamic or clinical variables emerged as predictors of outcome in this analysis. Examination of pre-dilatation and post-dilatation echocardiograms showed that balloon dilatation reliably resulted in cleavage of the commissural plane and thus an increase in valve area.\r"

None of the patients had received mediastinal irradiation. Computer-assisted analysis of digitised echocardiograms showed impaired rapid diastolic filling and an increased change of dimension between minimal cavity dimension and mitral valve opening. This impairment of diastolic function was related to the cumulative dose of doxorubicin. In contrast when angiotensin II was infused to increase the afterload the end systolic pressure-length and stress-shortening relation indicated normal left ventricular systolic function. But during baseline conditions the end systolic wall stress was significantly increased in patients in whom the cumulative dose of doxorubicin exceeded 360 mg/m2.\r"

The group means for resting right and left ventricular ejection fraction and exercise response were not significantly different from those reported five years before. Individual changes in values were within the normal variation seen in serial studies. This long term longitudinal follow up of patients after the Mustard operation showed that although some patients still had right and left ventricular dysfunction, resting ventricular function and exercise response remained stable over a five year period. This preservation of cardiac function may contribute to the long term survival of patients after the Mustard procedure.\r"

Age distribution, haemodynamic function, and previous palliative operation were similar in the two groups. Left ventricular volumes were calculated frame by frame throughout the cardiac cycle by Simpson's rule. The end diastolic volume index was similar in the two groups, but the ejection fraction was significantly lower in tricuspid atresia. Left ventricular peak filling and emptying rates were also lower in tricuspid atresia, although heart rates in the two groups were similar. End diastolic shape index was significantly higher in patients with tricuspid atresia, indicating a more globular shape, and changed less during systole, suggesting differences in the mechanism of ejection between the two groups. Analysis of pressure-volume loops showed normal phase relations between pressure and volume, but systolic stroke work was reduced in tricuspid atresia and correlated with stroke volume and shape change. Left ventricular function was impaired in patients with tricuspid atresia when compared with those with double inlet left ventricle and this finding may reflect structural differences caused by the absence of one atrioventricular connection.\r"

All patients presented with heart failure of less than six months' duration and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 0.40. Repeat biopsy and assessment of ventricular function were performed at a mean (SEM) of 79 (17) days after the initial biopsy. At repeat biopsy eight patients had evidence of ongoing myocarditis and 12 showed resolved myocarditis. In eight (66%) of the 12 patients with resolved myocarditis ventricular function had improved significantly. Left ventricular ejection fraction also improved significantly in four of eight patients during treatment despite ongoing myocardial inflammation. Regardless of the histological findings on repeat biopsy, early improvement in ejection fraction was associated with an excellent long term prognosis--that is 83% survived for at least three years. Histological resolution of myocarditis during immunosuppressive treatment is not a prerequisite for improvement in ventricular function; and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction during the first three months of treatment are predictive of clinical outcome.\r"

Though the haemorrhage was contained, the left to right (aorto-atrial) shunt led to a severe low output state, which was corrected by percutaneous closure of the fistula with a detachable balloon. A year after operation computed axial tomographic scanning showed the balloon in place though the para-aortic space persisted and communicated freely with the aorta.\r"

Spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride 2.5 ml in 8% glucose monohydrate solution was administered after preloading with 2 litre of lactated Ringer's solution. Simultaneously with the subarachnoid injection, an infusion i.v. of ephedrine 50 mg in 500 ml normal saline was initiated. Maternal heart rate and systolic arterial pressure remained stable during the spinal anaesthesia, but diastolic arterial pressure decreased (P less than 0.05). Fetal heart rate increased (P less than 0.05) 30 min after the introduction of the spinal anaesthesia, but blood flows in the fetal descending aorta and umbilical vein were unaffected. The pulsatility index of the fetal blood velocity decreased (P less than 0.05) both in the fetal aorta and in the umbilical artery 30 min after induction of the spinal anaesthesia, indicating a possible decrease in the placental vascular resistance. We conclude that, when normotension is maintained in the mother with a preload infusion and an infusion of ephedrine, spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section has no harmful effect on the fetal circulation.\r"

In a number of rats the lung content of hydroxyproline was determined. Mild reactions, namely increases in pneumocytes type II and macrophages, oedema and prefibrotic alterations were observed after the instillation of bleomycin. The reactions were comparable to those observed after additional hyperoxia alone. Lung hydroxyproline concentration was not increased after bleomycin plus oxygen as compared with bleomycin alone.

Hexamethonium alone in concentrations between 3.55 x 10(-3) and 7.1 x 10(-3) mol litre-1 produced neuromuscular blockade in a dose-dependent manner. Low concentrations of hexamethonium antagonized the neuromuscular blocking effect of all three neuromuscular blocking drugs, less with tubocurarine than with the other two. Increasing the concentration of hexamethonium produced potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effect, this being greater with tubocurarine than with either pancuronium or alcuronium. The cholinesterase activity in rat diaphragm homogenates was inhibited by hexamethonium. This inhibition was only significant at concentrations greater than those which resulted in antagonism and cannot, therefore, explain the observed antagonism. The mechanism of these observations is discussed with respect to the known behaviour of a combination of antagonists acting within a receptor system.\r"

In a cross-over design, each anaesthetist worked one day in a reference facility (for example, intensive care) and another day in a scavenged operating theatre where time-weighted exposure averaged nitrous oxide 58 p.p.m. and halothane 1.4 p.p.m. The results showed that arousal scores reached a peak in the middle of the theatre day, but this appeared to reflect the nature of operating theatre work rather than exposure. Reports of stress were also unaffected by exposure, although higher scores were associated with longer and more demanding work. Similarly, there was no evidence that exposure impaired performance of tasks assessing syntactic and semantic reasoning, verbal and spatial memory, sensory-motor reaction time and attention. Performance in these tasks was, however, sensitive to the cognitive demands of the tasks and to naturally varying non-exposure factors. It is concluded that, compared with the reference condition, the concentrations of anaesthetic agents found in actively scavenged operating theatres have no detrimental effect on either the mood or the cognitive functions of anaesthetists.\r"

  ".W": "The anticonvulsive properties of pregnanolone (as an emulsion) were evaluated in mice and compared with similar properties of Althesin and thiopentone. Pregnanolone emulsion was found to antagonize convulsions induced by the GABA antagonists pentetrazole, bicuculline and picrotoxin and by the specific glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine. The drug was effective in all four convulsive tests at subanaesthetic doses with maximal activity appearing within less than 1 min. The anticonvulsive therapeutic indices of pregnanolone emulsion were superior when compared with the therapeutic indices of Althesin and thiopentone in all four tests. Pregnanolone emulsion might be a useful alternative drug in the management of convulsive states resistant to conventional therapy.\r"

Values in the supine position were similar to those seen in non-pregnant subjects, but there was a significant reduction in LOSP and BrP in the lithotomy position unrelated to any change in intragastric pressure. It is concluded that the lithotomy position is associated with increased risk of regurgitation in early pregnancy.\r"

There were no clinically significant differences between the muscles in respect of onset time, maximum blockade, train-of-four ratio, or recovery index. There were no problems in recording a consistent electromyogram from the 1st DI, which appears to be well suited to clinical monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "In 15 patients (ASA I-II) undergoing intraabdominal gynaecological surgery, muscle paralysis for tracheal intubation and surgery was achieved by a combined bolus and demand infusion of vecuronium. The initial loading dose of 67 micrograms kg-1 and the rate of subsequent infusion were determined by evaluation of the tactile twitch response to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve while the neuromuscular blockade obtained was recorded blindly for control on the contralateral arm. A maintenance dose of 4.9 mg h-1 (2.0-7.6 mg h-1) produced a smooth course of blockade with minimum and maximum values of twitch height during infusion of 2% and 12%, respectively. A period of 15.9 min elapsed from the end of infusion to a TOF-ratio of 0.7, when neostigmine 2.5 mg was administered at the point of two palpable twitches to TOF-stimulation. Simple tactile evaluation of peripheral nerve stimulation is sufficient to determine the infusion rate of vecuronium required to produce stable and appropriate neuromuscular blockade during intra-abdominal surgery.\r"

The eyepiece of a conventional Jamin type interferometer has been replaced by an array of photocells which records the intensity across the interference pattern. Mathematical correlation procedures are used to locate the principal interference pattern maximum and, by sequential analysis of a fresh gas mixture followed by fresh gas plus vapour, it is possible to determine both oxygen and vapour concentrations. The instrument was used to analyse mixtures of oxygen and nitrous oxide and also oxygen, nitrous oxide plus halothane. It was found that the oxygen concentration could be determined to an accuracy of +/- 1% v/v and the vapour concentration to +/- 0.1% v/v. The instrument is suitable for monitoring concentrations delivered by an anaesthetic machine and may be included in a microprocessor-controlled anaesthetic machine.\r"
