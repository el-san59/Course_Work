  ".W": "We studied paraffin-embedded specimens from 18 surgically enucleated eyes with retinoblastoma by peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemistry with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, Leu 7 epitopes, neuron-specific enolase, the 200-kilodalton subunit of the neurofilament triplet polypeptide, and retinal S-antigen. We found that (1) glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, and Leu 7 epitopes were detected only in well-differentiated glial cells that were interpreted as reactive and not neoplastic, (2) undifferentiated neoplastic cells expressed both neuron-specific enolase and retinal S-antigen immunoreactivity, and (3) differentiated cells forming Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes were found to express neuron-specific enolase, retinal S-antigen, and, occasionally, neurofilament protein. These results support the view that retinoblastomas are composed of neuron-committed cells and favor the origin of these tumors from photoreceptor progenitor cells. We did not find any morphologic or immunohistochemical evidence of glial differentiation from tumor cells that would support the concept that retinoblastoma arises from a primitive neuroectodermal cell capable of divergent differentiation along neuronal and glial lines.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have explored the effects of variations in mouse polyoma virus genotype on patterns of tumor formation in the mouse. Four \"wild type\" virus strains were surveyed. Two were highly oncogenic, inducing multiple tumors of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, at high frequency and with short latency. The other two strains were weakly oncogenic, inducing fewer tumors, solely of mesenchymal origin, and after a long latency. These sharply contrasting tumor profiles were reproduced with virus stocks derived from molecularly cloned viral genomes. Though vastly different in their oncogenic properties, these cloned viruses proved equally effective in transforming established rat fibroblasts in culture and showed the same patterns of tumor antigen expression in cultured mouse cells. Complexes of polyoma middle T antigen and pp60c-src were demonstrated in extracts of epithelial tumors induced by a highly oncogenic virus strain. It is concluded that polyoma viral genetic determinants for tumor induction in the mouse are more complex than those previously defined by the use of cell transformation systems.\r"

In all 9 cases, the pol alpha + proliferating cells had a peripheral T-cell phenotype with T11 and Leu-4 antigens, whereas proliferating B cells with B1 antigen were rarely observed. As for T-cell subset antigens, the proliferating T cells had T4+ helper/inducer phenotype in 7 cases, while T8+ suppressor/killer T cells proliferated in 2 cases, although a significant number of T4+ proliferating cells were also recognized. The study on malignant lymphomas that evolved in the 2 cases showed that the T-subset antigens on major proliferating tumor cells were the same as those found in the preceding AILD lesions, suggesting that lymphoma T cells originate from the AILD lesion. The results suggested that AILD without histologic manifestations of malignancy and AILD-T may be a neoplastic disease derived from either subset of peripheral T cells.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the apparent paradox in the observation that most patients with immune thrombocytopenias have normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes (MKs), the extent of antigenic cross-reactivity between normal platelets and MK was examined. Indirect immunofluorescence and ultrastructural studies were carried out by means of four antisera specific for platelets: anti-GpIb, anti-GpIIb/IIIa, anti-PLA1, and an antiserum from a patient with quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia. Following incubation of freshly collected marrow with these antisera, MK were first identified by phase-contrast microscopy and then inspected for fluorescence. Almost all MKs were found reactive with the last three antisera, albeit to a variable extent. In contrast, only 24% reacted with anti-GpIb. The pattern of fluorescence, ie, rim, partial or cytoplasmic, appeared to be related to the extent of MK fragmentation. Only rim fluorescence of living MKs could be interpreted to indicate that the platelet epitope was exposed on the surface of the precursor cell. The observations suggest that platelet antigens are variably expressed on the plasma membranes of MKs. In a clinical setting, the heterogeneity among platelet target antigens and the extent to which these are exposed on MKs at various stages of maturation may dictate the severity of the thrombocytopenia and degree of ineffective thrombocytopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Explants derived from human gliomas have been characterized with respect to their cellular outgrowth pattern after 1-22 weeks in culture. A mat of cells which were fibronectin (FN)-positive and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-negative (hereafter designated FN+ cells) with a polygonal, flat morphology covered the growth substrate in a swirling pattern for a mean diameter of 9.2 mm around FN+ explants. FN+ cells showed ruffled plasmalemma, dilated rough endoplasmic reticulin (RDR), and extracellular filamentous strands. Rare desmosomes were compatible with at most minor leptomeningeal components or differentiation. FN+ cells predominated in six of seven cultures at passage 2, and their features were the same from various high-grade gliomas and gliosarcoma. Around other explants, elongated or stellate cells which were GFAP+ and FN- grew in a netlike pattern with little cell-to-cell contact. These GFAP+ cells surrounded explants at a mean diameter of 2 mm, substantially less than FN+ cells (P less than 0.005), and they grew more slowly than FN+ cells around explants. GFAP+ cells had an area/perimeter ratio which was less than that of FN+ cells. GFAP+ cells contained abundant intracellular filaments, rare desmosomes, and narrow RER cisternae. In mixed explants, GFAP+ cells often grew on top of FN+ cells. Individual cells which stained for both GFAP and FN were evident only from one glioma (8% doubly positive). Cells negative for both proteins resembled FN+ cells morphologically. Frozen sections of original glioma tissue showed FN+ vessel walls and GFAP+ parenchyma. Results are evidence for very early overgrowth of a preexistent FN+ cell type distinct from the GFAP+ parenchymal cell. The features of this distinct cell type are mesenchymal and resemble the proliferating vascular elements of gliomas in situ. The tendency for GFAP+ cells to grow on top of these FN+ cells suggests a feeder layer interaction. More knowledge of the origins and interactions of these two cell types may increase our understanding of the mechanism of antigenic changes in gliomas and may provide clues to improved therapeutic approaches.\r"

In cell transfer experiments to adult thymectomized, lethally irradiated, bone-marrow-restored (ATxXBM) mice, the effects of cyclophosphamide and irradiation appeared to be either overlapping (low dosages of cyclophosphamide) or additive (dosages of cyclophosphamide greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg), suggesting that the two agents exert their influence in dissimilar fashion, perhaps by injuring different cell types with the same basic function. The most pronounced conjoint effects are seen when low dosages of cyclophosphamide are given 3 days after the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from mice pretreated with low-dose irradiation. The implications of this observation with respect to immunotherapy are discussed.\r"

In this study, the authors have investigated the normal and pathologic tissue distribution of HHF35-positive cells using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method on methacarn-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of human tissue. In addition to muscle tissues (smooth, skeletal, and cardiac) the antibody localizes to myoepithelium, as well as most of the capsular cells of several parenchymal organs, including liver, kidney, and spleen, with extension of the latter cells into the splenic trabeculaes. In pathologic tissues, the antibody localizes to cells, identified by some investigators as \"myofibroblasts,\" in the stroma of certain tumors, within hyperplastic fibrous tissue responses (\"fibromatoses\") such as Dupuytren's contracture, and within fibrotic lung tissue. HHF35 also localizes to cells that proliferate within the intima in lesions of atherosclerosis and to a unique population of reactive mesothelial and submesothelial cells. Among tumors, it is positive only on leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas, and negative on all nonmuscle sarcomas. This antibody thus shows great potential utility as a diagnostic reagent in various pathologic conditions, most especially in the diagnosis of tumors of muscle origin.\r"

If this rate continues, with no changes in current levels of Medicaid nursing home payments, and if population forecasts are accurate, increasing numbers of the very old will generate an additional +6.3 billion (1982 dollars) annually of Medicaid nursing home payments by 2012: an increase of 280 per cent from 1982 levels. The stress this trend will place upon societal ability to check growth in public expenditures for medical care while maintaining basic services for other low income populations will be an important force shaping public health policy in the next 25 years.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis proposed in this study was that the initiation of active and passive knee motion within 48 hours of major intraarticular knee ligament surgery would not have the deleterious effects of increasing knee effusion, hemarthrosis, periarticular soft tissue edema, and swelling. We conducted a prospective study with randomized assignment of 18 patients into two groups: 9 patients in the \"motion\" group began 10 hours of daily continuous passive motion (CPM) on the 2nd postoperative day, while the remaining 9 in the \"delayed motion\" group used a soft hinged knee brace with knee hinges locked at 10 degrees of flexion and entered into the motion program on the 7th postoperative day. All knees were allowed full 0 degrees to 90 degrees of motion except for a total of seven knees with concomitant mensicus repairs and extraarticular reconstructions where 20 degrees to 90 degrees of motion was allowed, limiting the last 20 degrees of knee extension for the first 4 postoperative weeks to protect the repair. In all other respects, the rehabilitation program after surgery was the same for the two groups, including postoperative compression dressings, exercises, and weight-bearing status. Ten of the eighteen patients had acute ACL disruptions and 8 had chronic ACL insufficiencies. There was an even distribution of acute and chronic knee cases and of open and arthroscopic ligament procedures in the early and delayed motion groups. Associated surgery included four meniscus repairs, three medial collateral ligament repairs, and one lateral collateral ligament repair. Special suturing and fixation techniques were used at surgery to maintain the integrity of ligament and meniscus structures, allowing the surgeon to feel safe in subjecting the joint to early postoperative motion. The objective parameters measured were KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, Cybex isokinetic testing, girth measurements at four lower limb locations, range of motion goniometer measurements, postoperative pain medications, and days of hospitalization. Starting intermittent passive motion on the 2nd postoperative day did not increase joint effusion, hemarthrosis, or soft tissue swelling. In both motion groups, postoperative joint effusions were absent after the 14th postoperative day. There was no statistically significant difference in knee extension or flexion limits, pain medication used, or hospital stay in comparing the two knee motion programs. An important finding of this study was the significant decreases in thigh circumference that occurred within the first few weeks of surgery, which progressed despite a closely supervised inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a repetitive epitope on the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum was used in Kenya to assess malaria infections in Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus. The ELISA confirmed that 88% of 44 sporozoite-positive gland dissections were P. falciparum. The ELISA infection rate of 18.6% (n = 736) for individually tested mosquitoes for both species was significantly higher than the 10.4% (n = 537) salivary gland sporozoite rate determined by dissection. This difference was due to ELISA detection of medium and large sized oocysts on the midguts of infected mosquitoes which did not contain salivary gland sporozoites. From a series of 379 Anopheles that were cut at the thorax, ELISA tests on \"head\" and \"body\" portions showed that 29.5% of 95 positive mosquitoes contained circumsporozoite antigen in the body portion in the absence of salivary gland infections. This field evaluation demonstrates that the ELISA can most accurately be used to estimate sporozoite rates by cutting mosquitoes at the thorax and testing anterior portions.\r"

A total of 178 children in 3 regions were treated; 174 (98%) responded successfully, which required a greater than or equal to 75% reduction in parasites by day 2 and elimination of parasites by day 7. All 4 failures had low blood levels of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine at day 7. A single dose of chloroquine for treating malaria can be considered for those areas of Africa where the efficacy of such therapy is documented, and where an antimalarial drug sensitivity monitoring system is operating.\r"

Cheek pouch circulation was observed microscopically in the anesthetized animal; the brain and contralateral pouch were collected for histopathologic examination on days 3-12 post-challenge. Cheek pouch vascular lesions, observed in vivo, appear to involve three phenomena; early (beginning 3-4 days) adhesion of pigment-laden mononuclear cells to endothelium within venous vessels and loss of function of the small capillaries supplying the skeletal muscle fibers and, later (6-9 days), the apparent attraction of erythrocytes to venular and venous endothelium and to adherent monocytes. The aggregation of formed elements on endothelial walls leads to progressive occlusion of venules and small veins and contributes to the observed disruption of flow through capillary networks. Histopathology of the brain and pouch shows vascular changes similar to those seen in vivo; in addition, multifocal hemorrhages are seen commonly in the brain and occasionally in the pouch on postmortem. In severe disease, evidence of cerebral edema is seen in the brain. The data suggest that failure of capillary flow and disruption of venous outflow tracts by cell aggregates are central to vascular failure in both the cheek pouch and brain of the P. berghei infected hamster. This hamster model of human cerebral malaria allows the in vivo observation, still and video photomicrography, and manipulation of the peripheral vascular pathogenesis of a disease process similar to that seen in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The subcellular localization of the 150/130 Kd antigen in Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes was determined by electron microscopy using monoclonal antibody 9B11 and immuno-gold labeling. We now find that this antigen may be associated with the membrane of newly-infected human erythrocytes and the cytoplasm of ring stage parasites. During differentiation of the parasite to the trophozoite stage, the antigens are no longer detectable on the erythrocyte membrane, while gold particles become more numerous within the parasite and in the erythrocyte cytoplasm adjacent to the parasite. As the parasites develop into schizonts, more antigen appears within the parasites, and some of it appears in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. At the segmented schizont stage, many intraparasitic gold particles are associated with rhoptries and micronemes of developing merozoites. Likewise, gold particles are associated with elements of the rhoptry-microneme complex in free merozoites. No gold particles are detected on the surface of merozoites. These antigens are found most abundantly in erythrocytes infected with gametocytes, revealing a localization pattern similar to that of mature trophozoite-infected erythrocytes. These subcellular localization patterns are similar to those described for the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen.\r"

The assay utilizes a polyclonal rabbit antifilarial antiserum to capture, and a monoclonal antibody to identify, circulating parasite antigen. Using this assay, we found that greater than 95% of sera from microfilaremic donors with bancroftian or brugian filariasis, approximately 60% of sera from microfilaremic patients with hydroceles, chyluria, or elephantiasis, and 15%-20% of sera from asymptomatic residents of filariasis-endemic areas evidently contain filarial antigens. Antigen was also detected in the urine of some microfilaremic patients. Serum levels of antigen detected with one monoclonal antibody, ES34, correlated well with microfilarial density in night blood. In contrast, less than 5% of sera from residents of areas where lymphatic filariasis is not endemic reacted in the assay, even though approximately one-third of the donors whose sera were tested were known to be infected with intestinal nematodes. The assay was designed to be flexible enough to allow the parallel use of multiple monoclonal antibodies with different specificities and simple enough to be applicable in most areas where lymphatic filariasis is endemic.\r"

Although peripheral blood, thioglycollate-elicited, and antigen-elicited neutrophils from normal mice or thioglycollate-elicited neutrophils from P. brasiliensis-sensitized [corrected] mice killed Candida albicans (57% to 84%), they failed to significantly reduce inoculum colony forming units of P. brasiliensis [corrected] (0% to 13%). In contrast, antigen-elicited neutrophils from sensitized mice reduced colony forming units of P. brasiliensis [corrected] by 40%, and exhibited significantly enhanced candidacidal activity compared to thioglycollate-elicited neutrophils from normal or sensitized mice but not peripheral blood neutrophils from normal mice. Fresh serum, but not specific antibody, was required for optimal killing of P. brasiliensis [corrected], presumably representing an essential role for complement. Killing of P. brasiliensis [corrected] by antigen-elicited neutrophils from sensitized mice correlated with their ability to produce an enhanced oxidative burst, as measured by luminol-assisted chemiluminescence, when interacting with killed P. brasiliensis [corrected] cells. These results indicate that in P. brasiliensis-sensitized [corrected] hosts an inflammatory reaction to P. brasiliensis [corrected] results in activation of neutrophils for significant killing of the pathogen.\r"

Such ticks feed most abundantly on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), apparently the main reservoir hosts of these agents, and tend to concentrate in mouse burrows. Mice captured after permethrin-treated cotton was distributed, were infested by a tenth as many ticks as were those captured in adjacent nontreated sites, a difference that continued throughout the 4-month period of observation. On average, 72% of all mice captured in treated sites were free of ticks, while virtually all mice captured in nontreated sites were infested. Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), however, were tick-infested, regardless of site of capture. Laboratory-reared I. dammini failed to attach to mice captured in treated sites, and most such exposed ticks died. Distribution of permethrin-treated cotton appears to be a means for preventing transmission of the pathogens that cause human babesiosis and Lyme disease.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of cardiac output has become an essential feature of anesthetic management of patients with cardiac disease requiring operation. Thermodilution by way of a Swan-Ganz catheter is the current popular technique for cardiac output determination. Unfortunately, this method is costly and has an associated irreducible morbidity rate and has, in rare instances, resulted in death. The suprasternal ultrasonographic Doppler technique has shown promise for measuring cardiac output noninvasively; however, it is too cumbersome for continuous intraoperative use. In an effort to overcome this limitation, the esophageal stethoscope was modified to accept a Doppler probe. Herein, we have reported an initial comparison of transesophageal Doppler scanning and thermodilution in 23 adult men during general anesthesia. The average difference between thermodilution and descending cardiac output was 0.16 +/- 0.81 liters/min. The correlation between thermodilution and descending cardiac output increased with operator experience. In the last 13 patients, there was an average correlation of 0.85. After the equipment was mastered and improvements in design were made, descending cardiac output had a high correlation with thermodilution and appeared to track the dynamic changes during general anesthesia.\r"

Three infants presented with uncontrollable hypertension secondary to renal artery thrombosis due to umbilical artery catheterization for respiratory distress in the neonatal period. They all responded to nephrectomy. A fourth infant had stenosis of a polar vessel secondary to umbilical artery catheterization and was cured by partial nephrectomy. Two infants with renal artery stenosis secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia benefited from revascularization and, at last follow-up, were normotensive and off all blood pressure medication. Ultrasonography, isotope scanning, angiography and selective renal vein renin assays should be used to identify patients with surgically correctable lesions. The use of fine suture material and microvascular surgical techniques, including ex vivo revascularization and autotransplantation, can salvage renal parenchyma and relieve hypertension. Infants with less than 10 percent renal function on the involved side should have a nephrectomy. The infant with an umbilical arterial catheterization line needs blood pressure monitoring and aggressive evaluation and treatment of persistent hypertension.\r"

At present, the most reliable technique appears to be profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest, although long cardiopulmonary bypass times and coagulopathy remain significant problems. Interest in alternative procedures continues. Herein, we report our experience of aortic arch replacement in eight patients using profound hypothermia (12 to 17 degrees C) and circulatory arrest in six patients (Group I) and moderate (20 degrees C) hypothermia with low flow (200 ml/min), pressure-monitored (100 mm Hg) innominate artery perfusion by way of a 14 Ga. cannula in 2 (Group II). Arch repair was by patch graft in two, and tube graft in six. Concomitant ascending aortic replacement was performed in five, aortic valve replacement in four, and coronary bypass in two. Circulatory arrest times ranged from 15 to 71 minutes in Group I and were 15 minutes and 35 minutes in Group II. All patients survived. One patient in Group I had a neurologic injury of moderate severity, probably due to a hypoxic postoperative cardiac arrest. We have found low flow pressure-monitored innominate artery perfusion and moderate hypothermia to be simple and expedient, and we will continue use of this technique.\r"

These inert chemicals have a high solubility for the respiratory gases and, in emulsified form, are present in the oxygen-transporting plasma substitutes now undergoing clinical trials. Oxygen content is directly related to arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Thus, although oxygen transport of Fluosol-DA 20% (FDA) is only 0.75 ml per 100 ml per 10 kPa, oxygen delivery at the tissues will be adequate in the presence of a high PaO2. FDA has a low viscosity at low shear rates and this, together with a very small emulsion particle size of 0.1 micron, helps provide improved tissue oxygenation in conditions of ischaemic hypoxia. Fluorocarbon plasma substitutes may be employed as 'blood', but may also be used for a wide range of purposes in clinical practice. This review describes some current and potential future applications.\r"

Photographs of the ultrasound images were analyzed to score \"hit\" or \"miss\" for the internal jugular vein (IJV) and the carotid artery (CA), and to measure both the angle between these vessels and the distance from the skin to the IJV. In 11 subjects, the effect of a Valsalva maneuver on IJV width was also determined. Owing to bilateral CEA in 9 of the 21 subjects, there were 12 studies of nonsurgical sides (NSS) and 30 studies of surgical sides (SS). SS and NSS hit frequencies were statistically indistinguishable both for the IJV and the CA. In no photograph did the IJV lie medial to the CA. A Valsalva maneuver did not change IJV width on either the SS or the NSS. These data show that prior CEA does not affect the location of the IJV. Tissue alterations or adhesions may render actual IJV cannulation more difficult or risky. The data suggest but do not prove that prior CEA may not increase the incidence of CA puncture under clinical conditions.\r"

However, in recent years several studies have failed to show negative effects on peripheral blood flow. It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of celiprolol, a beta-1-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and of metoprolol, a beta-1-adrenergic blocking agent without ISA, on peripheral blood flow of patients with and without PAOD. In an acute trial 24 patients (group I: 12 patients with PAOD stage I and II; group II: 12 patients without PAOD received a single dose of 200 mg celiprolol or 200 mg metoprolol in a double-blind crossover design. Celiprolol induced no significant changes in calf and skin blood flow at rest or during reactive hyperemia. Basal vascular resistance (BVR) and minimal vascular resistance (MVR) were not affected. Metoprolol, however, significantly reduced muscle blood flow and increased BVR in both groups. Subsequently the patients were treated in a randomized double-blind design with a daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol or metoprolol for three weeks. In long-term treatment skin and muscle blood flow at rest and during reactive hyperemia, BVR, and MVR were not affected by celiprolol. Metoprolol significantly lowered calf blood flow at rest in patients with PAOD; other parameters remained unchanged. In patients without PAOD, metoprolol caused a significant decrease of calf blood flow at rest and an increase of BVR. Calf blood flow during reactive hyperemia, as well as skin blood flow at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed no significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exacerbations of symptoms have been reported in some women with asthma just prior to and during menstruation. We examined changes in airway responsiveness to methacholine during 2 consecutive menstrual cycles in 17 well-controlled asthmatics with a wide range of airway responsiveness. In 10 women with regular natural cycles, measurements were made 1 wk before and 1 wk after the start of menstruation to coincide with the highest and lowest progesterone levels. The mean concentration of methacholine to cause a fall in FEV1 of 20% (PC20) premenstruation was 1.49 mg/ml, which was not significantly different from the mean postmenstruation PC20 of 1.34 mg/ml (p = 0.45). Although there were only 10 subjects, the power was 96%, indicating little likelihood of any difference between the 2 phases. In 7 women taking oral contraceptives, the mean PC20, measured within 1 wk of completing a 21-day course, was 1.19 mg/ml, which was not different from the mean PC20 of 0.97 mg/ml measured after the start of menstruation but before restarting medication (p = 0.17). The power was 98%. In both groups, there was no difference in FEV1 or medication use during the cycle, but symptoms were worse during menstruation. The results suggest that the fluctuations in serum progesterone levels that occur during natural menstrual cycles are insufficient to alter airway responsiveness in an unselected sample of asthmatic women. They also demonstrate that changes in symptoms occur during the cycle both in women with natural cycles and those using contraceptives and that these changes are not related to serum progesterone levels or airway responsiveness.\r"

Dose-response curves to each agonist were generated in random order, and tantalum bronchograms and simultaneous measurements of pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) were obtained at the plateau of the response of each dose of agonist after intravenous (iv) infusion. At 5 X 10(-7) mol/kg, NE (after beta-adrenergic blockade) caused an increase to 254 +/- 27.3%, PGF2 alpha to 368 +/- 50.0%, U-46619 to 522 +/- 98.5%, and MCh to 1,204 +/- 173% of baseline in RL. However, airway diameter changes within the major diameter airways varied substantially for each agonist. Methacholine caused substantial contraction in all airways. Neither NE nor U-46619 caused significant airway narrowing in generations zero or 1, although both agonists caused greater than 30% narrowing in sixth generation airways. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (5 X 10(-7) mol/kg) cause an increase in RL of greater than 350%; however, this was accompanied by an approximately 10% increase (dilation) in airway diameter in generation 1 through generation 4 airways and an approximate 25% narrowing in generation 6 airways. We demonstrate that both alpha-adrenergic agonists and thromboxane analog cause substantial bronchoconstriction in situ in the central air-ways of the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It seems likely that mast cells are activated since histamine was detected in early- and late-phase allergen- and exercise-induced asthma. On the other hand, the origin of NCA is still in some doubt, and the possibility exists that it may be derived from other cell types. Furthermore, there is no firm evidence that the mast cell is directly involved in pathogenesis and some evidence that it may have a secondary or amplifying role. There is an urgent need for further details of other mast-cell-associated mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Measurements in the blood have the obvious disadvantage of only indirectly reflecting events in the lung. It seems likely that more invasive procedures such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy will yield more critical information regarding mast cells and their mediators in early- and late-phase reactions, as well as the effects of selective drugs and the role of other cell types.\r"

We have explored the potential utility of CPAP in a patient with sleep apnea without a major contribution of airway obstruction as measured by the usual criteria. The patient showed dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement in central apnea when treated with CPAP. A low level of CPAP (7.5 cm H2O) resulted in the reduction of central apneas from 281 to 32 per night with no significant change in obstructive apneas, which increased from 43 to 59 per night. On a separate night, a higher level of CPAP (12.5 cm H2O) resulted in virtually complete removal of all apneas. Measurement of pharyngeal properties revealed pharyngeal cross-sectional area in the low normal range, but increased pharyngeal compliance. This case illustrates that pharyngeal abnormalities may be present in patients with central sleep apnea, and CPAP may be beneficial in the treatment of this disorder. Although the exact mechanism of action of CPAP in this disorder is unclear, we propose several possibilities that may account for the beneficial effect of CPAP in this patient.\r"

  ".W": "Of all snake bites reported in the United States of America each year, 75 per cent occur in the states that form the Southeastern Surgical Congress. Pit vipers, coral snakes, and exotic imported snakes are all found in that area. Deaths from those snake bites are rare, but morbidity is high and it is often due to overtreatment rather than undertreatment. Treatment in the field is rarely necessary for the victim who is less than 1 hour away from definitive care. The type and size of the snake and the age, size, and health of the patient are important guides to therapy. Envenomation may not occur. When envenomation occurs from pit viper bites, antivenom is not always necessary, and its inherent dangers (serum sickness and possible hypersensitivity) must be weighed against the severity of systemic and local manifestations. All coral snake bites resulting in envenomation must be treated vigorously with coral snake antivenom. The Oklahoma City Poison Control Center can guide the treatment of bites from exotic snakes. The most frequently encountered toxic spider bites in the Southeast are those of the black widow and brown recluse spiders. The symptoms of black widow envenomation are best controlled with calcium gluconate or a muscle relaxant. Antivenom should be reserved for severe reactions. Brown recluse necrotic lesions are best controlled with dapsone.\r"

  ".W": "Although easily taken for granted when functioning properly, malfunction of the anorectal mechanism presents profound inconvenience and embarrassment. The anal sphincters, internal and external, have been the subjects of extensive study yet much appears to remain unsettled. Each sphincter has been proposed, at one time or another, to be the sine qua non of fecal continence, and both clinical and nonclinical studies have often yielded contradictory results. For example, it has been established that the internal sphincter is actually relaxed during the moments of greatest need! On the other hand, the external sphincter can be fully contracted only for a matter of seconds before becoming fatigued. Anatomic studies of the external sphincter date from 1715, yet it has defied consistent and consensual description. A rather persistent theme has been the claimed existence of anatomic subdivisions (e.g., deep, superficial, and subcutaneous). Some form of this traditional description is found in all modern anatomic texts; however, when dissecting, the student is invariably disappointed in his or her efforts to discern the subdivisions. Further, the roles of other important, nonsphincteric mechanisms are often overlooked. This presentation will briefly review the controversial history of the anorectal mechanism and correlate the results of both clinical and anatomic/physiologic studies. By so doing, a functional concept of the structure of the anorectal mechanism emerges.\r"

  ".W": "Although changes in lifestyle may increase the life expectancy of persons at high risk for coronary disease, there is no cost-effective screening test that can select these persons from the general population. Exercise testing has been considered, but epidemiologic studies have not proved that it effectively identifies persons at risk for myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Theoretically, exercise testing should have limited sensitivity in predicting events because abnormal responses occur only when sufficient atherosclerotic plaque has accumulated to impede coronary flow. Abnormal test responses cannot occur before plaque has reached such dimensions. A test that indicates the presence of any atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary lumen would be more useful than one that indicates compromise of blood flow. Data show that sensitive detection of coronary calcific deposits accurately predicts the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. Sensitive radiographic techniques such as digital subtraction fluoroscopy need to be developed as screening tests. Screening studies should be blinded and include only hard endpoints, and follow-up periods should be no less than 10 years so that the detected disease can develop to its symptomatic endpoint.\r"

We discuss mechanisms in three intestinal diseases in this overview of the mucosal immune system. Genetic and immunologic factors are important in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, which is characterized by damage to the mucosa of the small intestine with resultant malabsorption. Pathogenic microbes are important environmental agents that interact with the intestinal mucosa and initiate local immune responses. Advances in the understanding of the mucosal immune response to these pathogenic microbes have produced a clear picture of the way in which this specialized immune system works in concert with systemic immunity. As to the autoimmune nature of inflammatory bowel disease, no specific antigen has been shown to incite the inflammatory reactions and neither the target cells nor the effector mechanism involved have been identified. Several factors exist, however, to suggest an autoimmune mechanism and the role of mucosal immunologic factors in this disease.\r"

Responses can be induced in more than 80% of patients using either agent, although a greater number of complete pathologic remissions may be achieved with deoxycoformycin. Despite interesting preliminary data, the optimal dose, schedule, treatment duration, and impact of therapy on survival are unknown. Clinical trials comparing efficacy and toxicity of alpha-interferon and deoxycoformycin, the extent of cross-resistance, and relationship of activity to previous splenectomy are in progress. Additional studies are testing combinations of these agents. Although interferon is commercially available for treating hairy cell leukemia, considering such therapy routine is counterproductive. Long-term clinical trials of interferon and deoxycoformycin are essential to advance our biologic knowledge of this rare disease, and to ensure optimal therapy for a potentially curable malignancy.\r"

Recent research has yielded new insights into the physiological properties, molecular structure, biochemical regulation, and functional heterogeneity of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In addition, Ca2+ channel antagonist drugs have been developed that are valuable both as probes of channel structure and function and as therapeutic agents. Preliminary evidence suggests that these drugs may be useful in the treatment of diverse neurological disorders, including headache, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and epilepsy.\r"

Normal control nerve was treated in the same way. In normal nerves, Class II molecules are expressed on endothelial cells and on occasional mononuclear and perineurial cells. In Guillain-Barre nerves the inflammatory infiltrate consisted mainly of Class II-positive cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage and of lesser numbers of T4 and T8 lymphoid cells. T4 cells predominated in perivascular collections. In the more severely affected patient, there was a marked increase of Class II molecules expressed on endothelial cells, perineurial cells, and most Schwann cells. Schwann cells associated with unmyelinated fibers and the Schwann cell processes of denervated Bungner bands all expressed Class II molecules. These histological changes were less marked in the more mildly affected patient. It is suggested that the expression of Class II molecules on the myelin forming cell, the Schwann cell, has important implications for the pathogenesis of the demyelination that occurs in Guillain-Barre syndrome.\r"

It is now apparent that antiphospholipids antibodies such as anticardiolipin might well play a role in mediating the elements of this paradox. In addition, other cutaneous vascular conditions as diverse as livedo reticularis and Degos' disease might also be related to this type of autoimmune response.\r"

On direct immunofluorescence, pericapillary fibrin was found in 14 (93%) of the 15 patients with venous ulceration but in only one (7%) of the 14 subjects with ulcers due to other causes. We also confirmed the presence of dermal pericapillary fibrin in legs with venous disease without ulcerations. We conclude that the pericapillary fibrin is easily demonstrable in the dermis adjacent to venous ulcers. In the evaluation of ulcers due to uncertain causes, the presence of dermal pericapillary fibrin may provide additional diagnostic help.\r"

All nine patients had clinically detectable eruptions and had skin biopsy specimens with histologic changes of grade 2 acute GVHD. Although most cases were mild and self-limiting, four patients required systemic corticosteroids to treat their disease.

While apparent high-affinity binding has been observed using dextran-coated charcoal assays, several other characteristics of receptor protein have not been observed. The production of free water on incubation of tritiated estradiol (labeled in the C2 position) with melanoma cytosols suggests the possibility that the apparent binding observed is due to phenomena other than specific receptor-steroid interactions. Melanomas from 15 patients were evaluated for the presence of estrogen receptor using immunocytochemical techniques with a monoclonal antibody directed against the human estrogen receptor protein (H222 Sp gamma). Immunohistochemical evaluation included intensity and distribution of staining. None of the 15 cases demonstrated specific immunohistologic reactivity with the anti-receptor antibody. Control breast and uterine tissue confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of the methods. These results suggest that the apparent estrogen-binding capacity of human melanoma tissues is the result of interactions other than with estrogen receptor, and reaffirm the need to investigate alternate steroid protein interactions, such as catechol estrogen formation, in studying sex steroid influences on human melanoma.\r"

Two pathologic types of cutaneous vasculopathy are demonstrated, one leukocytoclastic and the other mononuclear. The leukocytoclastic vasculopathy is associated with high titers of Ro(SS-A) and La(SS-B) autoantibodies (detected by gel double-diffusion techniques) and general serohyperreactivity. In marked contrast, the mononuclear vasculopathy is associated with low titers of Ro(SS-A) and La(SS-B) autoantibodies (detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but not gel double-diffusion techniques) and general serohyporeactivity. Approximately 70% of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and cutaneous vasculitis have also developed peripheral and/or central nervous system disease. The pathogenesis of the nervous system disease is unknown, but preliminary data suggest a vasculopathy.\r"

In almost all patients the diagnosis was suggested by an imaging procedure. In the 12 nonoperated patients the average size of the tumor was 4.7 cm (range: 3-8 cm). No problems related to the tumor occurred during the follow-up period. The average size of the resected lesion was 10 cm (range: 4-32 cm). The usual indication for resection was pain, mass, or a combination of these manifestations. Five lobectomies, five left lateral segmentectomies, two trisegmentectomies, two segmentectomies, and two enucleations were performed. There were no postoperative deaths. Review of the literature indicates that although rapid growth of the lesion occurred during pregnancy in one patient, the effects of pregnancy or contraceptive drugs on growth are inconsistent. Spontaneous rupture occurs infrequently, and the potential for rupture should not constitute an indication for resection, which should be performed selectively. Intraoperative blood loss may be appreciable, but a mortality rate near 0% has been reported in all institutional series.\r"

Two distinct groups were noted: an infantile group (mean age: 3 months) with obstructive jaundice identical to biliary atresia and a late onset group (mean age: 9 years) with various combinations of pain, mass, and jaundice. Two patients had cystoduodenostomy performed and both required revision. One of six patients who had Roux-Y cystojejunostomy required revision. All seven patients who had primary cyst excision and two patients who had secondary cyst excision with Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy have been followed prospectively and have done well. The follow-up period ranges from 1-11 years with an average of 5.8 years. Cyst excision should be performed as a primary or secondary procedure whenever feasible. The rare patients with intrahepatic ductal dilatation (Caroli's disease) are best approached by hepatic lobectomy when possible, and those with choledochocele should be treated by unroofing the cyst as indicated by the anatomy encountered.\r"

  ".W": "This review of 28 cases of airway obstruction by vascular anomalies in the past 6 years emphasizes the importance of these anomalies as causes of obstruction, stridor, and apnea in infants as well as the important contribution of telescopic bronchoscopy to the recognition of these lesions, especially compression of the trachea by the innominate artery. There were 20 patients with compression by the innominate artery; four were surgically corrected. Seven vascular ring anomalies were all corrected by operation as was an enlarged left atrium and malformed mitral valve in one patient. Vascular anomalies caused 26% of the obstructive airway lesions in a series of infants who had bronchoscopy for obstruction, stridor, or apnea. Failure to diagnose and treat these entities may result in progressive respiratory embarrassment and even death. Barium esophagogram and aortic arch arteriogram, the traditional modalities for diagnosing vascular rings, may fail to identify tracheal compression by enlarged cardiac chambers or the more common \"anomalous\" innominate artery. Telescopic bronchoscopy will identify tracheal compression by the innominate artery; furthermore, it will identify the area of compression by the vascular ring. Observation of the compressed area during corrective surgery ensures that the operative manipulations are appropriate and successful in relieving the obstruction. This observation can be facilitated by televised monitoring and videotaping.\r"

  ".W": "This is a progress report of a prospective, randomized study involving 200 consecutive patients treated electively with either parietal cell vagotomy (PCV) or selective vagotomy and antrectomy (SV-A). Both groups comprised patients with pyloric, prepyloric, or duodenal ulcers. There was no operative mortality in either group. Patients were examined at 2, 6, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter for 8-10 years. The two operations produced no statistical difference in the frequency of diarrhea. Dumping (p less than 0.0005) and weight loss (p less than 0.0005-p less than 0.05) were statistically less after PCV than after SV-A. There were two recurrent ulcers (2.2%) after SV-A. One was treated successfully by medical therapy and one patient suspected of having gastrinoma had total vagotomy. Nine patients had recurrent ulcers in the PCV group for an accumulated recurrence rate of 10.1% at 10 years by life-table analysis. There was a significant difference (p less than 0.033) between the curves for recurrent ulcers in the two groups of patients. The recurrent ulcer rate after PCV was 21% for patients with pyloric and prepyloric ulcers and 6% for patients with duodenal ulcer. There was no significant difference between the recurrent ulcer rate for PCV and SV-A if the patients with pyloric and prepyloric ulcers were withdrawn from the study. Of the nine patients with recurrent ulcers in the PCV group, three had an inadequate vagotomy and four had a pyloric or prepyloric ulcer before operation. Three patients were successfully treated with antrectomy. Five patients were treated successfully by medical therapy and remained healed for long periods without recurrence. One patient had five recurrences. He declined operation and remained free of symptoms for 3 years after his last recurrence. Poor gastric emptying necessitated gastroenterostomy in five patients in the SV-A group and in one patient in the PCV group. Patients' clinical results were evaluated according to a simple Visick grading scale. A significantly (p less than 0.0005) greater number of patients were in Visick I category after PCV than after SV-A. The clinical results obtained with PCV make this the operation of choice for the elective surgical treatment of duodenal ulcers even though the results obtained with SV-A were good.\r"

One IMA was used in 68% (N = 469) and both IMAs were used in 19% (N = 130). Only saphenous vein grafts were used in 13% (N = 93). The mean number of anastomoses (all types) was 3.5. Fifty-seven patients were having a reoperation; bilateral IMA grafting was performed in 23% (N = 13). In 60 patients, 3 or more IMA anastomoses were performed: 3 IMA anastomoses, 50 patients; 4, 9 patients; and 5, 1 patient. In 27 patients, repeat coronary arteriography was performed within 30 days of operation to evaluate dynamics of IMA, saphenous vein, and native coronary artery flow. Major flow or all flow was through the graft (vs. the native coronary artery) in 62% of in situ IMA bypass grafts, 86% of free IMA grafts and 94% of saphenous vein grafts. Hospital mortality excluding patients having reoperation was 1.7% (11/635); it was less than 1% for patients having either single IMA grafting procedures (4/437) or bilateral IMA grafting procedures (1/117). Hospital mortality for patients receiving only saphenous vein grafts was surprisingly high, 7.4% (6/81). Major determinants of flow through the in situ IMA sequential graft are the size and flow of the IMA, the degree of proximal native coronary artery narrowing, the distally grafted to proximally grafted coronary artery size ratio, and probably the size of the side-to-side anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A protocol was developed to compare prolonged heart preservation by hypothermic storage with prolonged hypothermic storage interrupted by a period of reperfusion. Hearts from adult mongrel dogs were excised after administration of 4 degrees C crystalloid cardioplegia. Group A hearts (N = 7) underwent 7.5 hours of ischemia at 4 degrees C followed by 1.5 hours of reperfusion and rewarming (A0). Group B hearts (N = 8) underwent 3 hours of ischemia at 4 degrees C, 1.5 hours of reperfusion and rewarming (B1), 3 additional hours of ischemia at 4 degrees C following repeat cardioplegia, and finally 1.5 hours of reperfusion and rewarming (B2). During reperfusion, hearts were defibrillated and left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by measuring isovolumic peak systolic pressure and maximum positive rate of rise of LV pressure (+dP/dtmax) with an intraventricular balloon. LV biopsy samples for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay were obtained before ischemia and after each rewarming period. One Group A heart could not be defibrillated and studied. All Group B hearts completed the protocol. LV function, as assessed by peak pressure and +dP/dtmax, at B1 and B2 exceeded values obtained at A0, but the differences were not statistically significant. The mean ATP level was 63.4 +/- 7.7% of baseline at B1 and 79.7 +/- 4.3% of baseline at B2 (p less than .03). The mean ATP level was 57.9 +/- 5.9% of baseline at A0 (p less than .007, B2 vs. A0). It is presumed that intermittent reperfusion allows repletion of substrate stores, which results in improved myocardial protection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Anatomical repair of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) seems more attractive than the more conventional atrial baffle procedures because of resultant left ventricular-aortic continuity. The results of anatomical repair in 16 consecutive neonates with TGA and intact ventricular septum were reviewed; special consideration was given to technique and guidelines to avoid complications. Infants underwent repair within 6 days of life (average weight, 3.3 kg). Survival was 88% (14 of 16 patients). One death occurred from pulmonary hypertension and atrial shunt reversal causing cyanosis after an uncomplicated procedure; the other was due to myocardial ischemia caused by kinking of an anomalous coronary artery after attempted repair. Complications of ventricular swelling and coronary tension or kinking were successfully treated by Silastic skin patches in 2 patients and pericardial aortic patches in 2, respectively. One patient had successful repair of supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. Because anatomical repair of TGA must be performed in the first week of life, special consideration must be given to meticulous anatomical dissection, careful coronary transfer, and optimal myocardial preservation. The excellent short-term results favor the continued application of anatomical repair of TGA with intact ventricular septum in infancy.\r"

The cleft in its anterior leaflet was closed in each patient in whom the valve was incompetent. The septal defect was closed with pericardium, and the coronary sinus was left on the right atrium. Two patients required reoperation, 1 to close a recurrent septal defect and 1 to replace a mitral valve that had been competent for the first several years after the initial repair. All 33 survivors remain in New York Heart Association Functional Class I. Nineteen patients have no mitral incompetence, and the remaining 14 have only mild incompetence. These data demonstrate that excellent late results from repair of partial atrioventricular canal are possible when the mitral valve is managed as a bileaflet structure.\r"

The test drug was given through a nasogastric tube beginning 4 to 6 hours after operation until oral ingestion was possible. Serum levels of verapamil were measured at selected times after operation and when postoperative atrial dysrhythmias occurred. Postoperative atrial dysrhythmias occurred in 10 of the 53 verapamil-treated patients and in 20 of the 56 placebo-treated patients. Patients with verapamil drug levels higher than 150 ng/ml had fewer postoperative atrial dysrhythmias than those with lesser verapamil levels (p = .034) or than placebo-treated patients (p = .012). Only 2 of 31 patients with drug levels higher than 150 ng/ml experienced postoperative atrial dysrhythmias. Approximately 40% of verapamil-treated patients had drug levels lower than 150 ng/ml at 48 hours after operation. It is concluded that oral administration of verapamil prevents postoperative atrial dysrhythmias in a dose-dependent fashion.\r"

In fact, many of these tumors may be operable and some perhaps curable. A technique has been developed based in part on our experience with previously described procedures. A preliminary sternal split is used to demonstrate the extent of the mediastinal involvement as well as to provide enhanced exposure and proximal control of the great vessels. The pectoralis major muscle is used with a generous flap of overlying skin comprising nearly half of the anterior portion of the chest. A tracheostomy is then created in a fashion similar to the placement of a cardiac valvular prosthesis by creating a circular defect in the pectoralis major flap and suturing it to the tracheal remnant. This technique offers a reasonably safe and reliable means of creating a low anterior mediastinal tracheostomy for tumors previously considered inoperable. The preliminary sternal split makes the procedure safer and easier to perform, and the use of a very large pectoralis major island flap allows for reliable closure of the resulting mediastinal and sternal defects.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of two prophylactic antibiotic regimens during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was investigated in dogs. Airborne contamination was determined by spraying two different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens) into the air of the operating room. Dogs were operated on and underwent CPB with a bubble oxygenator. Pericardial suction, either conventional (blood-air) or selective (only blood), was used. Particularly in the first situation, an impaired humoral host defense is induced. In dogs given the regimen consisting of penicillin G (benzylpenicillin), gentamicin sulfate, and flucloxacillin, the number of contaminated sites for both bacteria was reduced (p less than .01) compared with those given cefuroxime. The effectiveness of the combined antibiotic regimen could be ascribed to increased serum bactericidal activity and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) killing capacity. Cefuroxime enhanced the PMN respiratory burst. As a result, two weeks postoperatively the rate of infection was small in both groups. We conclude that prior to CPB, antibiotics should be administered prophylactically to overcome a period of impaired humoral host defense during CPB.\r"

Chronic rejection appeared to be responsible for the arteritis. The onset of coronary occlusive disease is insidious, and recognition depends on the performance of coronary arteriography, which is usually not done until the one-year follow-up. Early coronary arteriography is suggested to rule out occlusive coronary arteritis when cardiac allograft function is not satisfactory, even when the endomyocardial biopsy shows no evidence of rejection.\r"

The insulin suppression test has been used to support this diagnosis prior to surgical intervention. In this study the euglycemic clamp technique was used to compare five control volunteers with four hypoglycemic patients with suspected insulinoma. Insulin was infused over successive two-hour periods at 2, 4, and 8 mU/kg/min. Plasma glucose levels were clamped at 80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L) using an artificial pancreas. High insulin levels were measured in all subjects, ranging from 225 +/- 30 microU/mL (1614 +/- 215 pmol/L) to 1018 +/- 239 microU/mL (7304 +/- 1714 pmol/L). Levels of C peptide fell to 0.1 ng/mL (0.028 nmol/L) in control subjects but remained at high levels in the patients. Insulinoma was confirmed on laparotomy in all four patients. In two patients tested after removal of the tumor the results were found to have returned to normal.\r"

As part of the Stirling County Study (Canada), the information was gathered from 1003 adults through structured interviews and was analyzed by means of a diagnostic computer program. The risk for mortality was assessed using external and internal standards, controlling for the effects of age and sex as well as for the presence of self-reported physical disorders at baseline. Increased risk was found to be significantly associated with affective but not physical disorders and with depression but not generalized anxiety. When this evidence about mortality was combined with information about subsequent psychiatric morbidity among survivors, 82% of those who were depressed at baseline had a poor outcome.\r"

However, during the first half of the 17th century, a single authority existed in England, the Court of Wards and Liveries (1540-1660), with responsibility for appointing guardians for the mentally disabled. In 1637, Benoni Buck, a man with severe mental retardation, was referred to this court from Jamestown, Va. The ensuing conflict over Benoni's custody exposed a contradiction between the economic and political exigencies of a new order and the social obligation to protect the mentally ill. Benoni Buck is almost certainly the first case of mental disability reported from the English colonies. The case thereby represents a minor landmark in the history of mental illness in America; May 1987 marks the 350th anniversary of the first petition for guardianship.\r"

Evaluation of the survival with each dose revealed no significant difference at one year, but significantly better survival was seen with the 25-mg dose (64%) than the 5-mg dose (31%) at two years. There was no significant difference in survival when the clinician was permitted to make a dosage adjustment up to 10 mg in the low-dose group and 50 mg in the higher-dose group when the patient demonstrated evidence of a symptomatic exacerbation. Patients assigned to the higher dose appeared to feel more uncomfortable during the early months of the study, as indicated by significantly higher scores on subscales of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90R and higher side effect scores for retardation and akathisia.

A significant decrease in dyskinetic symptoms occurred with the administration of GVG, associated with a twofold increase in cerebrospinal fluid levels of GABA; THIP produced a more moderate, yet consistent decrease in the involuntary movements. A pathophysiologic role for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neuronal transmission in tardive dyskinesia was explored by analyzing cerebrospinal fluid GABA concentrations in drug-free schizophrenic patients with and without tardive dyskinesia. A significant reduction in cerebrospinal fluid levels of GABA was observed in the dyskinetic schizophrenics compared with the nondyskinetic controls. These data compliment a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting a critical role for GABA-ergic neurons in the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia.\r"

In addition, more informative DNA analysis has been achieved using antibodies to bromodeoxyuridine-modified DNA, proliferation-associated nuclear antigens, or tissue-type-specific cytoplasmic antigens as second stains for two-parameter analysis. Improvements in both staining and instrumentation have also increased the usefulness of flow cytometry in analysis of \"rare events,\" ie, cell types comprising less than 0.1% to 0.5% of a total cell suspension. Commercially available slide-based image-processing systems have been developed that provide sophisticated cell and tissue analysis functions using inexpensive personal-computer-based systems.\r"

All patients had abdominal bruits. Two patients underwent primary repair. One patient underwent APF resection and replacement of the superior mesenteric artery with autogenous vein. Another patient underwent APF and bowel resection. Three patients survived. One patient died of liver failure. The development of an abdominal bruit in a patient with penetrating abdominal trauma suggests APF and should prompt angiography.

Clots were seen in 86 patients in multiple views and cross sections. Normal veins completely collapsed with probe pressure on the skin. Blood flow was seen and heard, and abnormal flow was detected. There were no false-negatives (100% sensitivity). Early in the study, two false-positives occurred (78% specificity), but these errors will not recur. These tests are accurate, noninvasive, and inexpensive. They differentiate acute from chronic thrombosis and are repeatable.

Overall mortality was 30% (14/47). Factors predictive of death were as follows: age greater than 60 years (86% mortality vs 21% mortality), preoperative vs no organ failure (57% vs 6%), multiple vs single abscess (53% vs 16%), and exploratory vs directed operative approach (39% vs 17%). Although the interval between the primary surgery and reoperation was similar between survivors (13 days) and nonsurvivors (14 days), five (36%) of 14 nonsurvivors were in septic shock and eight (57%) of 15 survivors showed evidence of organ failure prior to reoperation. The median survival period following reoperation in this group was only four days. Computed tomography (CT) and/or ultrasonography were performed to localize a source of infection in 24 patients. In nine (82%) of 11 patients, CT identified the abscess, while ultrasonography was positive in 15 (72%) of 21 patients. Neither the interval to operation nor the mortality was significantly different in patients diagnosed with CT and ultrasonography when compared with those who underwent exploration on the basis of clinical findings. To lower the mortality and to shorten the interval to reoperation in these high-risk patients, noninvasive diagnostic testing and confirmation by percutaneous sampling must be sought before the onset of clinical sepsis and organ failure.\r"

Previous experience had suggested that our surgical formula based solely on the distance deviation would lead to excessive undercorrections. A higher percentage of the augmented recession group achieved satisfactory alignment and were able to discontinue wearing bifocals postoperatively than the posterior fixation group. The data also showed a trend (though not statistically significant) suggesting that more members of the augmented recession group were able to discontinue wearing spectacles entirely. We concluded that the posterior fixation suture technique is not as effective as the augmented recession technique for the treatment of partly accommodative esotropia with a high accommodative convergence-accommodation ratio.\r"

All subjects had active synovitis that was unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and conventional slow-acting antirheumatic drugs. Initial treatment with azathioprine (AZA), 100 mg/day, or methotrexate (MTX), 10 mg/week, orally, was adjusted at predefined intervals. Both treatment groups showed statistically significant improvement at week 24, compared with baseline status, in all 9 clinical outcome variables. There were no apparent statistically significant differences in these outcome variables between the 2 treatment groups. There was a trend toward a more marked and rapid improvement in the MTX-treated group. Radiologic evidence of progression of joint damage was similar in both treatment groups at 24 and 52 weeks. Four of the 42 patients (2 receiving MTX and 2 receiving AZA) discontinued the study because of side effects, and 1 MTX-treated patient withdrew because of personal reasons. Outcome measures at week 52 (open phase) were not statistically different from those at week 24. Twenty-three patients were still taking the medication at week 104. We found that AZA and MTX were similarly effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and that this beneficial effect was maintained for up to 2 years in most patients.\r"

PEGG, eluted at acid pH from large pools of human placentas, contained 99% IgG material. Sephacryl S300 gel filtration revealed a main fraction (76%) of native IgG accompanied by 10% aggregates and 14% digested fragments (as identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis with specific antisera). Previous in vitro data had suggested that alloantibodies to class II HLA antigens were present in this preparation. This study confirms that PEGG and F(ab')2 fragments were able to inhibit stimulating cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Additional findings showed that: IgG from PEGG were cytotoxic for the non-T cell population; IgG or F(ab')2 from PEGG bound only to class II HLA-bearing cells; F(ab')2 from PEGG were able to block the complement-mediated cytotoxicity of anti-HLA-DR and anti-DQw1 alloantibodies. These data confirm the presence of class II HLA alloantibodies in PEGG. These antibodies may account for the clinical improvement reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings are similar to recent data showing that the injection of anti-Ia antibodies in experimental animal models decreases the autoimmune process.\r"

Ethidium bromide staining of these preparations separated by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the Sm/RNP preparation contained RNA, but the free Sm preparation did not. These preparations were used as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera characterized as anti-Sm only, anti-Sm/RNP, and anti-RNP only were assayed. A quotient (Q) was derived from the ELISA optical density obtained with Sm/RNP as antigen divided by the optical density obtained with free Sm as antigen. Q values less than 4.0 characterized sera with anti-Sm only, values of 4.0-12.0 were observed in sera with anti-Sm plus anti-RNP, and values greater than 12.0 in sera with anti-RNP only. Sera with antibodies to other nuclear antigens were not reactive in this system. It has traditionally been difficult to identify sera with anti-RNP when this is present simultaneously with, and in lower concentration than, anti-Sm. With this method, such sera can be identified by their Q value, which falls in an intermediate region between a lower Q for anti-Sm and a higher Q for anti-RNP.\r"

Frequent contact with blood and body secretions of potentially infectious patients undoubtedly is a major factor in the increased seroprevalence and risk of hepatitis B. The potential sequelae of HBV infection include chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and development of the chronic carrier state, any of which may have a devastating impact on the personal health and professional career of the emergency physician. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982 and has been found to be effective in approximately 90% of vaccinees. The vaccine is generally well tolerated; the most common side effects are reactions at the injection site, although systemic side effects may occur. The risk of serious illness due to the vaccine is very low. Using a risk/benefit analysis to assess the risks of hepatitis B and the risks and benefits of HBV vaccination, it is clear that HBV vaccination should be accepted by the emergency physician to minimize the risk of contracting hepatitis B.\r"

Over a period of 24 months, we have performed outer-table calvarial bone grafts on 62 patients, totaling 367 individual grafts, which were placed in an average of three separate facial sites per patient. The grafts have been easily taken in a prompt fashion with little postoperative discomfort or graft-site deformity. We have not experienced significant complications in harvesting or in placement of cranial bone. The contour provided in the face is quite natural and predictable.\r"

Thirty-one of the scans were reported as showing fatty change without fibrosis; in 12 cases the liver histology showed mild but significant fibrosis and in four cases fibrosis was of sufficient severity to necessitate methotrexate withdrawal. Five of the scans were reported as showing fibrosis and in all the biopsy showed significant fibrosis. This was of sufficient degree to necessitate methotrexate withdrawal in two cases. No patient with a normal ultrasound scan showed significant fibrosis and thus we concluded that such patients may be spared liver biopsy and safely continue with methotrexate therapy. Ultrasound cannot reliably distinguish between fatty change and fibrosis, so all patients with abnormal scans require liver biopsy.\r"

Endoscopically the tracheo-bronchial mucosa was diffusely purpuric and hyperaemic and also showed pale elevated plaques, bullous lesions and ulceration. Histological examination of biopsies of skin and nasal and tracheo-bronchial mucosa showed subepithelial blister formation associated with an accumulation of polymorphonuclear cells at the epithelial-subepithelial junction, and linear IgA deposits on direct immunofluorescence.\r"

Following maternal smoking, a significant increase was found in the nicotine concentration in maternal plasma accompanied by a significant increase in the fetal heart rate. The flow velocity was recorded in the fetal descending aorta by combining real-time ultrasonography and the 2 MHz pulsed Doppler technique and the waveform of the maximum blood velocity was analysed. The duration of the acceleration part of the pulse cycle (start-to-peak time) remained unchanged during the study period. The least diastolic blood velocity increased significantly after smoking. The pulsatility index fell significantly during the first 5 min after smoking, probably as the consequence of fetal tachycardia, but was normal again at 10 min. The rising slope rose significantly within the first 10 to 20 min after the onset of smoking. The results indicate, that, following maternal smoking of one cigarette, fetal central circulation increases but peripheral resistance is unchanged.\r"

Fetal aortic blood flow increased during labour from 200 to 245 ml/min/kg in the group without analgesia (P less than 0.05) and from 211 to 236 ml/min/kg in the group with epidural analgesia (P less than 0.05) but decreased insignificantly from 216 to 204 ml/min/kg after pethidine. After paracervical block the aortic blood flow fell in two out of three fetuses. Not only is epidural analgesia the most effective means of pain relief during labour, it is also the type of obstetric analgesia that interferes least with the physiological response to labour in terms of its effect on the fetal blood flow.\r"

A rapid decrease in PRA was observed during and after infusion of 1000 micrograms or 1500 micrograms sulprostone. PRA returned to the initial values at 24 h after drug administration. The lowest levels of PRA were 36% and 51% of the initial values (P less than 0.001) in the two drug concentration groups. No significant changes were observed in the control group. The value for plasma cAMP did not correspond completely to the changes in PRA. Serum concentrations of oestradiol, progesterone and chorionic gonadotrophin showed a gradual decrease during drug administration. The changes in serum potassium, sodium and calcium were minimal. The decrease in PRA associated with sulprostone is very surprising. Our finding elucidates in part the still rather poorly known mechanisms and function of renin-angiotensin system in pregnancy.\r"

The estimates were made using published data on the risk of Down's syndrome in relation to maternal age from 4528 affected and over 5 million unaffected pregnancies, and on the risk in relation to serum AFP from 68 affected and 36,645 unaffected pregnancies. Separate estimates were derived for AFP levels using gestational age based on the time since the first day of the last menstrual period and on an ultrasound biparietal diameter measurement. In each case this was done with and without adjusting AFP levels to take account of maternal weight. The same sources of data were also used to construct six Down's syndrome screening policies, each combining information on maternal age and serum AFP. For example with one policy the detection rate would be 28% and would involve selecting 2.8% of unaffected pregnancies for amniocentesis; using age alone the same detection rate could only be achieved by selecting 4.3% of unaffected pregnancies for amniocentesis--an increase of 50%. In general, screening for Down's syndrome using both maternal age and serum AFP is more efficient than either alone.\r"

The median remission duration is now 1 to 2 years, and a substantial fraction of patients achieve long-term disease-free survival. Bone marrow transplantation provides an improved antileukemic effect compared with chemotherapy alone, and it is the treatment of choice for selected groups of patients. The major limitation is the risk of transplant-related mortality. Most patients are not currently eligible for bone marrow transplants because of advanced age or lack of a histocompatible donor. Autologous marrow transplantation may be effective in selected setting, but this remains investigational at present. Substantial improvement in results of treatment of AML requires the development of new and effective chemotherapeutic agents that are non-cross-resistant with available drugs. Results of bone marrow transplantation may substantially improve if innovative measures to prevent major complications are successful.\r"

The characteristic immunophenotype of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma was: surface IgM and IgD+, BA1+, B1+, BA2-, B2-, B4+, Leu 14+, Leu 1+, HLA-DR+, and common acute lymphocytic leukemia associated (CALLA) antigen negative. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were identified in ten cases, with structural or numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 11 or 12 in nine cases. Five cases had structural abnormalities involving the long arm of chromosome 11; three of these had translocations with chromosome 14 at band q32. Three cases had trisomy 12, and one case had a translocation involving the long arm of chromosome 12. The tenth case had a translocation involving the long arms of chromosomes 7 and 9. These characteristic immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings suggest a close lineage relationship between intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma and small lymphocytic (well differentiated) lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Their differing clinical, cytologic, and architectural features suggest, however, that intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma should be considered a separate category of lymphocytic lymphoma in the International Working Formulation.\r"

Assessment of leukocyte function revealed profound abnormalities in adherence-dependent activities including impaired granulocyte adhesion to glass/plastic surfaces or nylon wool, decreased granulocyte aggregation and chemotaxis, and diminished lymphocyte blastogenesis, but normal neutrophil oxidative activity, serum immunoglobulin, and complement levels. By immunofluorescence analysis, CD11b and CD18 monoclonal antibodies specific for the 155-kd alpha polypeptide of Mo1 (gp 155, 94) and the 94 kd beta peptide common to Mo1, LFA-1 (gp 170, 94), and Leu M5 (p 150, 94) (surface molecules that promote leukocyte adhesion) failed to bind to unstimulated and A23187 calcium ionophore-stimulated granulocytes or mononuclear cells of the affected dog as compared with strong specific binding to canine control cells. The Mo1 glycoproteins were only barely detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of immunoprecipitates from lysates of 125I surface-labeled neutrophils from the affected dog as compared with intense bands seen with canine control cell precipitates. We conclude that this dog has a severe leukocyte surface glycoprotein deficiency syndrome that is similar, if not identical, to that recently recognized in humans. Dogs with deficiency of leukocyte Mo1, LFA-1, and Leu M5 expression may represent a useful animal model to characterize further the molecular basis for an inherited disorder in leukocyte effector function.\r"

Within each stratum, patients were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with chlorambucil and prednisone (CP) or fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). Morbidity from both regimens was negligible. Complete response (CR) was defined as the resolution of organ enlargement and the return of blood count to normal. The CR rate for the entire CP group (n = 54) was 59% and that for the TBI group (n = 54), 52%; median survivals were 53 and 57 months respectively. In the 41 patients with CLL the CR rate for CP (n = 17) was 47% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival for CP was 48 months, and for TBI it was 51 months. In the 21 patients with WDLL the CR rate for CP (n = 15) was 53% and that for TBI (n = 6), 67%; the median survival for CP was 42 months and has not yet been reached for TBI. For the 46 patients with FL the CR rate for CP (n = 22) was 72% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival was 55 months, and for TBI it was 56 months. None of the differences in CR or survival are statistically significant (P greater than .05). In these indolent lymphoproliferative diseases, CP and TBI are equally effective forms of initial treatment irrespective of the end point being defined as CR or survival.\r"

The post-BrdU infusion BM aspirates from 40 patients were incubated with tritiated thymidine in vitro. These double-labeled slides were utilized to determine the duration of S-phase (Ts) in myeloblasts and their total cell cycle time (Tc). The Ts varied from four to 49 hours (mean, 19 hours; median, 17 hours). Similarly, there were wide variations in Tc of individual patients ranging from 16 to 292 hours (mean, 93 hours; median, 76 hours). There was no relationship between Tc and the percentage of S-phase cells, but there was a good correlation between Tc and Ts (r = .8). Patients with relapsed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) appeared to have a longer Ts and Tc than those studied at initial diagnosis. A subgroup of patients at either extreme of Tc were identified who demonstrated clinically documented resistance in response to multiple courses of chemotherapy. We conclude that Ts and Tc provide additional biologic information that may be valuable in understanding the variations observed in the natural history of ANLL.\r"

  ".W": "The promising antineoplastic agent diaziquone is associated with prolonged aplasia and rare instances of bone marrow necrosis, but only mild extramedullary toxicity. To explore the drug's potential as a myeloablative agent prior to bone marrow transplantation, we compared its effects on hematopoietic versus marrow stromal cells. After short-term (one to six hours) or prolonged (three to seven days) exposure to the drug, marrow was assayed for hematopoietic (CFU-Mix, BFU-E, CFU-GM) and stromal (CFU-F) colony-forming cells and studied in long-term marrow culture (LTMC). One- and three-hour treatments produced little cytotoxicity, even at 5000 ng/mL. After six-hour treatments with this dose, marrow was depleted of CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM, but produced CFU-GM in LTMCs, indicating an ongoing input of CFU-GM from a surviving pre-CFU-Mix population. In contrast, elimination of the latter may be inferred from the absence of CFU-GM in LTMCs exposed for three to seven days to diaziquone at only 150 ng/mL. Under these conditions, CFU-F recovery was 40% and adherent stromal layers in LTMCs were similar to untreated controls regarding rate of development and cellular composition. Our in vitro pre-CFU-Mix-ablative regimen correlates with clinical data that show prolonged but reversible myelosuppression at steady-state diaziquone plasma levels of 101 +/- 10 ng/mL (mean +/- standard error of mean) during 7-day constant infusions. In conclusion: hematopoietic cells are more sensitive than marrow stromal cells to the dose- and highly time-dependent cytotoxicity of diaziquone, a direct drug-induced noxious effect on the marrow microenvironment is an unlikely cause of the isolated episodes of marrow necrosis after the use of diaziquone in vivo, and prolonged infusion of diaziquone represents an attractive means for achieving myeloablation in selected clinical situations.\r"

  ".W": "Red blood cells (RBC) from favic patients are characterized by (a) severe oxidative damage (contributed by autoxidation of divicine and isouramil, two pyrimidine aglycones present in fava beans) and (b) greatly increased calcium levels. In vitro, both autoxidation of divicine and calcium loading produced marked alterations of proteolytic systems in intact RBC. Specifically, autoxidizing divicine inactivated procalpain, the proenzyme species of calcium-activated cytosolic neutral proteinase, or calpain. Inactivation was much greater with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient RBC than with normal RBC. On the other hand, loading of normal and G6PD-deficient RBC with calcium resulted in conversion of procalpain to calpain and eventual autoproteolytic inactivation of calpain itself, and extensive release of acid endopeptidase activity from the membranes into the cytosol. Damaged RBC from favic patients had significantly lowered procalpain activity and an abnormal subcellular distribution of acid proteinase activity that was found mostly in the cytosol. When purified calpain was incubated with membranes from acetylphenylhydrazine (APH)-treated RBC, significant proteolysis was observed affecting mostly band 3 and hemoglobin chains, ie, the two proteins involved in the onset of aggregation of Heinz bodies. Moreover, exposure of intact RBC to 20 mmol/L APH induced depletion of procalpain activity for which the time course was inversely related to formation of Heinz bodies. These findings support the role of procalpain in protecting G6PD-deficient RBC from oxidant-induced Heinz body formation and imply that exhaustion of the procalpain-calpain system is an important step in the mechanisms of RBC damage and destruction in favism.\r"

All sera were number coded and scored blindly by two independent observers. ANA was detected in 61% of sera by IF and 62% of sera by IP. Positive and negative results corresponded between the two techniques in 97% of sera. Patterns and titres corresponded in 85% of positive sera. The two independent observers scored ANA more consistently with IP than with IF. Both methods were technically simple to perform and produced consistent results with control sera. These data show that IP provides results equivalent to the traditional IF technique for demonstrating ANA on HEp-2 substrate. Fewer discordant results between two independent observers using IP suggests that this technique has technical advantages for interpretation of ANA on HEp-2 substrate.\r"

Cystic parathyroid glands are difficult to differentiate from thyroid cysts, and may be the cause of false positive diagnosis, as in three cases in this series. Topographic assessment showed a relatively low sensitivity in detecting disease in the right upper gland (50%) and in the upper mediastinum (70%). The decreased accuracy in these regions is probably because of the particular anatomical location of the right upper gland and sonographic limitations in screening the mediastinal region. Awareness by the radiologist and surgeon of the variations in texture and location may influence both diagnosis and intraoperative detection of the abnormal parathyroid gland.\r"

Radioisotope studies demonstrated parenchymal damage in three of seven and reduced function in four of 10 refluxing kidneys. Subsequent investigation showed no increase in the areas of parenchymal damage but there was evidence that function in some kidneys had deteriorated. It was thought that this was due to disturbances in inter-renal or renal-child related growth velocities.

Six of these patients remained on oestrogen therapy. Suppressed gonadotrophin levels (FSH and LH), despite orchiectomy, correlated strongly with benefit from aminoglutethimide. No relationships between response to treatment and changes in serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, oestradiol or prolactin were found. Six patients had side effects requiring cessation of therapy. A further 27 patients developed less severe toxicity.

One hundred and forty-eight such grafts were randomized to act as controls or to receive dipyridamole 200 mg b.d. for 48 h pre-operatively and dipyridamole 200 mg b.d. with aspirin 300 mg daily for 6 weeks after surgery. Patients were well-matched and the mean pre-operative pressure index of 0.37 rose to 0.78 during the first postoperative week. No deaths were attributable to the treatment. Ninety-three grafts were autogenous vein and the remainder were prosthetic (GORE-TEX (PTFE), human umbilical vein or externally supported Dacron). At 1 year autogenous vein cumulative patency was 75 per cent. Overall results showed higher patency in the treated group (P = 0.012) which was entirely accounted for by the difference between prosthetic dipyridamole and aspirin group (85 per cent patency) and prosthetic control groups (53 per cent patency, P = 0.005) and arose during the first postoperative month. There were 11 deaths and 8 amputations in the dipyridamole and aspirin group and 8 deaths and 12 amputations in the control group. It is concluded that a six week perioperative course of dipyridamole and aspirin allows the patency of prosthetic femorodistal bypass to approach that of autogenous vein, and the regimen therefore is recommended for patients who may require a prosthetic graft.\r"

The cumulative patency at 3 years of the reversed grafts was 77 per cent and that of the in situ grafts was 68 per cent (n.s.). The patency of all grafts was affected adversely by small veins (P less than 0.005), long grafts (P less than 0.05), low volume of blood flow in the grafts (P less than 0.001) and poor run-off (P less than 0.05). These factors influenced the outcome of the in situ and reversed operations to a similar degree and there was no statistically significant difference between them within any subgroup. The mean compliance of the in situ grafts measured 3 months or more after operation with an ultrasonic echo-tracking system was 0.024 +/- 0.01 per cent/mmHg (+/- s.d.) compared with 0.017 +/- 0.01 per cent/mmHg for the reversed grafts (t = 2.43, P less than 0.02). The incidence of fibrous stricture formation as shown by intravenous digital subtraction angiography was 29 per cent in both the reversed and the in situ grafts. The results of the study to date indicate that reversed and in situ vein grafts are equally effective for femoropopliteal bypass.\r"

The onset of allograft rejection was marked by an elevation of the total corrected increment score by fine-needle aspiration cytology in 80 per cent of rejection episodes whereas intrarenal pressure was raised in only 46.6 per cent. However, intrarenal pressure was greater than 40 mmHg on a single occasion in 16 measurements performed on allografts showing evidence of cyclosporin nephrotoxicity. By combining fine-needle aspiration cytology and intrarenal manometry the sensitivity of these tests for allograft rejection was increased to 93.3 per cent at the onset of renal dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that fine-needle aspiration cytology is more sensitive than intrarenal manometry as a single investigation. However, the combined test may have an important role in the differentiation of allograft rejection and cyclosporin nephrotoxicity in the early management of renal allograft recipients.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of a chronically ill or mentally handicapped child in a family can be a stress for the child's siblings, who often are ill informed about the nature and prognosis of the illness, may be uncertain what is expected of them in the caregiving role, may feel their own identities threatened, and may experience ostracism by their friends and misunderstanding at school. Although individual reactions vary widely, feelings of anger, guilt, resentment and shame are commonly reported. Excessive responsibility and concern about one's identity may add to these feelings and culminate in psychologic problems in the sibling. The physician caring for the family must be alert for symptoms of emotional disturbance or social maladjustment among the siblings of chronically ill or mentally handicapped children and should be prepared to counsel the family or refer them to a counsellor experienced in this area. In general, the first step is to be sure that the sibling is fully informed about the condition and to encourage frank discussion between the parents and the handicapped child's siblings.\r"

  ".U": "87215527\r", 
  ".W": "The histogenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) has been investigated since its description. Twenty ASPS cases were analyzed for immunohistochemical content, with emphasis directed toward the paraganglial, Schwann cell, and muscle theories of histogenesis. In addition, the cases were examined for possible prognostic clinical features. The clinical characteristics of the patients were similar to those reported previously concerning average age (23 years); male:female ratio (1:1); and predominant primary site (lower extremity, nine cases). Despite a local recurrence rate of 20% and a metastatic rate of 68% (including four at presentation), the natural history was often indolent and relapse commonly occurred very late. The average follow-up period was 10.1 years. While the overall 5-year survival was 67%, only seven of 18 patients were alive without disease at last follow-up (1.7-32 years), and one patient died of tumor after a 28-year disease-free interval. Neither tumor size nor site appeared to affect prognosis. The tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically for neurofilament, S-100 protein, met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, acetylcholinesterase, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, Factor VIII-related antigen, serotonin, lysozyme, neuron-specific enolase, myoglobin, cytokeratins, desmin, and vimentin. Except for weak vimentin immunoreactivity, no other antigenic expression was detected despite multiple repeated experiments with several antibodies. S-100 protein which is present in virtually all granular cell tumors was absent in the cases of ASPS. The lack of detectable expression of neurofilament, met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin, and neuron-specific enolase is interpreted as evidence against the paraganglial theory of histogenesis. Similarly, the repeated absence of the muscle proteins, desmin and myoglobin, in contrast to a previous report, is interpreted as evidence against a myogenic origin.\r"

Five tumors were benign and 50 were malignant. The average age at presentation was 47 years for the benign tumors and 54.3 years for the malignant ones. Although the overall benign/malignant ratio was 1:10, women were more likely to have a malignant tumor than were men. The site of 80% of the benign tumors was the middle to anterior portion of the tongue, whereas over 85% of malignant tumors involved the base. Clinical signs and/or symptoms related to the site aroused suspicion in some cases but often were of short duration and in over 60% of cases did not occur. The most common benign tumor type was the myoepithelial variant of the benign mixed tumor. The most common malignant tumor type was the low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (38%) followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (14%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (10%), and clear cell carcinoma (8%), with occasional basaloid, papillary cystadenocarcinoma, acinic cell and mucus-producing adenocarcinoma. Treatment was similar to that of other accessory salivary gland neoplasms of similar histologic type and clinical stage. Prognosis worsened with high histologic grade, old age, and advanced clinical disease at presentation.\r"

Prolonged exposure to hypoxemia coupled with volume overload or pressure overload can produce myocardial fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction, which complicates surgical correction. Despite these difficulties, surgical correction is possible for most congenital heart lesions in adults, with subsequent improvement in symptoms and survival paralleling that achieved after repair in childhood. In the future, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons will encounter an additional subgroup of adults with congenital heart problems. These are patients who have survived initial correction or palliation of complex heart diseases and later develop complications owing to failure of abnormal native valves or prosthetic valves, narrowing of surgically created conduits, or intrinsic ventricular failure. Such patients will add to the challenge of evaluation and treatment of adults with congenital heart disease.\r"

More precise diagnostic methods, increased awareness of the dismal natural history of patients with these aneurysms, improved methods of myocardial and cerebral protection, refined vascular grafts and prosthetic valves, widespread availability of specific coagulation components, more sophisticated anesthetic and postoperative management, and more timely referral of patients (prior to rupture or irreversible deterioration of left ventricular function, or both) have all been instrumental in promoting these improving results. The thrust of future efforts should be directed to the appropriate identification, diagnosis, and treatment of remote aneurysms and atherosclerotic disease in the cerebral and coronary circulation, detection of patients predisposed to aortic dissection, and ultimately to the development of pharmacologic methods to prevent aortic dissection and atherosclerotic aneurysm development. Eventually, it is hoped, more complete understanding of the genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry of both acquired and congenital degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysms will also lead to preventive measures for these patients.\r"

Metocurine 0.42 mg X kg-1 provided muscle relaxation. No further IV anaesthetic agents were given. The haemodynamic response to induction, intubation, and surgery, differed minimally between agents. The degree of rigidity on induction was identical with both agents, as were the intervals following induction at which patients lost consciousness, regained consciousness, or met criteria for extubation. However, the interval until extubation criteria were met did correlate with the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. Sufentanil 15 micrograms X kg-1, was clinically indistinguishable from fentanyl 100 micrograms X kg-1, when used as the primary anaesthetic agent for coronary surgery.\r"

Four hundred and forty adult females were randomly assigned to one of four pretreatment groups. Three hundred and ninety-five patients completed the study. One of the following pretreatments was given prior to injection of 1.5 mg X kg-1 of succinylcholine: normal saline IV three minutes and again immediately prior to succinylcholine; 0.06 mg X kg-1 d-tubo-curarine (dTc) IV three minutes prior and normal saline IV immediately prior; normal saline IV three minutes prior and 1.5 mg X kg-1 lidocaine IV immediately prior; 0.06 mg X kg-1 dTc IV three minutes prior and 1.5 mg X kg-1 lidocaine IV immediately prior. Fasciculations after injection of succinylcholine were observed and recorded. Patients were contacted by telephone 40-48 hours postoperatively and questioned about the presence of muscle pains. These pains, if present, were graded either mild or moderate to severe. The patients in the two dTc-containing groups exhibited less fasciculations than patients in the other two experimental groups. The dTc-lidocaine group had a lower incidence of moderate to severe fasciculations than in any of the other three groups. Patients in the dTc, lidocaine, and dTc-lidocaine experimental groups reported a higher incidence of absence of muscle pain and a lower incidence of moderate-severe pain than did patients in the saline group. The dTc-lidocaine group had more patients without myalgia and less patients with moderate to severe myalgias than any of the other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of tubulin and desmin, the constituent proteins of microtubules and intermediate filaments, respectively, were studied in normal and hypertrophied rat myocardium by high-resolution immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in 25-day-old rats by aortic stenosis. In the normal heart, double immunolabelling of ultrathin frozen sections of papillary muscle using gold-labelled probes for tubulin and desmin showed that microtubules ran primarily in a longitudinal direction through the intermyofibrillar spaces, perpendicularly to the desmin filaments. Microtubules were present near nuclei, mitochondria, and plasma membranes, while desmin filaments formed transverse connections between adjacent Z disks. No tubulin was observed near the intercalated disks, which were rich in desmin filaments. In hypertrophied hearts, myocytes exhibited the typical morphological features of developing hypertrophy. While there was little difference in the distribution of the microtubules around mitochondria and at the plasma membrane, considerable increases were seen near the nuclei and along the myofibrils. Desmin labelling was distributed transversely as in the controls; however, sometimes it was longitudinally oriented either in the intermyofibrillar space linking 2 Z disks out of register or along digitations of the intercalated disks connecting neighboring desmosomes. The unique rearrangement of desmin and tubulin filaments in hypertrophied cardiac myocytes emphasizes their distinct role in myocyte organization. We suggest that, during the development of cardiac hypertrophy, desmin filaments are mainly involved in maintaining the myofibrils in register, whereas the degree of assembly of microtubules is correlated with the rate of protein synthesis and with myofibrillogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) contain renin and angiotensinogen. To examine whether angiotensins are synthesized intracellularly and secreted by these cells, we assayed cell extracts as well as serum-free media of intact confluent BAEC. Angiotensins were identified by their retention time on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and direct radioimmunoassay. BAEC and their media contain angiotensin II and angiotensin III. The rate of angiotensin accumulation in the media was a nonlinear function of time; the highest rate occurred in the first 15 minutes. The amount of angiotensin II accumulated in 30 minutes exceeded 200% of the intracellular concentration and that of angiotensin III exceeded 500% of the initial intracellular content. Neither renin nor angiotensinogen could be detected in the media. The viability of these cells was supported by low lactic dehydrogenase activity in the media (less than 0.5% of cellular level). These data suggest that BAEC is capable of synthesizing and secreting angiotensins. We postulate that this endothelial-derived angiotensin system may play an important paracrine or autocrine role in influencing local vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the feasibility of quantitative ultrasonic techniques to define the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, samples of freshly excised human aortas were sewn to a sample holder and immersed in a saline bath for ultrasonic interrogation. Integrated backscatter of a 2-microsecond portion of the backscattered radiofrequency signal was measured with a 10 MHz focused transducer. Integrated backscatter was calculated by normalizing the root-mean-square voltage of the gated signal to the root-mean-square voltage obtained by replacing the tissue sample with a nearly perfect reflector. Microscopic examination of the 124 interrogated sites allowed differentiation of normal, fibrous, fibrofatty, and calcified regions. A site was considered calcified if it contained any histochemically detectable calcium. Values of integrated backscatter were markedly elevated from calcified regions (-30.0 +/- 6.4 dB, n = 25; mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001) compared to normal (-43.2 +/- 2.4 dB, n = 20) and fibrofatty (-43.9 +/- 3.4 dB, n = 43) sites. Values from fibrous regions (-40.7 +/- 3.8 dB, n = 36) were also significantly different compared with the calcified and fibrofatty regions (p less than 0.001). Thus, we have demonstrated that quantitative ultrasonic backscatter identifies and differentiates calcification and fibrosis in atherosclerotic sites offering promise for the noninvasive assessment of the pathologic status of the arterial wall.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three uremic patients on intermittent hemodialysis for eight to eighteen years provided the material for the present pathological study. In all of them, there was evidence for dialysis related amyloidosis based on previous clinical or histological findings or both. The material examined consisted of nine skin biopsies, five abdominal fat aspirates, eight trans-iliac bone biopsies and numerous post-mortem specimens of various visceral organs from eight cases. None of the skin biopsies or fat aspirates showed amyloid deposits. In only one bone biopsy could a small Congo red positive area be recognized that showed characteristic birefringence under polarizing light. Autopsy material findings were negative except for one case: this patient had been dialyzed for 18 years. Very minute amyloid deposits with a positive immunofluorescence staining for beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) were found in the walls of small vessels from her lung, heart, liver and intestine. Thus, in chronic hemodialysis patients the accumulation of beta 2-M amyloid fibrils in tissues other than joints and juxta-articular structures appears to have a low incidence, to occur lately and to be of limited size. Although extra-articular amyloid deposits may progressively occur and extend with increasing survival time on dialysis, tiny deposits such as those observed in only two of our patients will hardly lead to serious complications.\r"

The estimation of hCG is clinically superior to the measurement of any other pregnancy protein or biochemical parameter. If an hCG test has a sensitivity of 25 IU/1, then 90-100% of ectopic pregnancies will give a positive result. But, the hCG test cannot distinguish between intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy, and here ultrasonic examination and laparoscopy are routine diagnostic measures to identify the site of trophoblastic activity. If highly sensitive hCG tests are used routinely, they may detect small amounts of hCG so early in ectopic pregnancy that the tubal swelling is missed, or hCG may be reminiscent from trophoblastic activity of a previous regressing intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy. The lesson we learn from such cases is that a patient with an elevated hCG level in whom an intrauterine pregnancy has been excluded should be carefully followed-up as long as hCG remains elevated because of the possibility of an early ectopic pregnancy.\r"

These studies show that there are specific physiologic mechanisms for regulating structural and functional coupling between myometrial cells during labor. The integration of these control mechanisms probably operates to ensure appropriate activation and maintenance of synchronous contractility of the myometrium and effective delivery.\r"

  ".W": "This article has considered the subject of bony pelvic dystocia and soft tissue dystocia. Dystocia most often results from a combination of fetal and pelvic factors. However, on many occasions the size and shape of the pelvis is the initial problem, which encourages the fetus to take up a malposition such as occiput-posterior, and this in turn results in a dysfunctional contraction pattern that may or may not be corrected by oxytocin augmentation--a vicious circle that can only be broken by performance of a cesarean section. With minor degrees of pelvic dystocia, asynclitism and molding of the fetal head can often make a safe vaginal delivery possible. Clinically all pelvises can be categorized into adequate, questionable, and too small. The latter group is the least common and generally includes the congenitally or developmentally abnormal pelvises, and in most cases primary cesarean section should be the mode of delivery. In all other pelvises with a vertex presentation, a trial of labor is indicated because the fetal head is an excellent pelvimeter. With proper fetal monitoring with an intrauterine pressure catheter, with the use of a partograph to assist in the diagnosis of an active-phase arrest, followed by a cesarean section at the appropriate time, there is no increase in fetal or maternal morbidity. If the breech is the presenting part, then there are only two types of pelvis--very adequate and inadequate--and x-ray pelvimetry should be used to help in the classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many techniques for ligamentous reconstruction have been developed in recent years. In the United States, injuries of the knee have been increasingly treated with innovative methods of surgical reconstruction, most of which have used normal structures. There are obvious theoretic advantages in using synthetic materials that might simplify surgery, spare normal tissues, and possibly facilitate stronger repairs. To these ends, several synthetic substances have been used experimentally and clinically. This is a brief summary of eight of the materials that have been or are being investigated in the United States. Some are no longer in use, others are currently being used in clinical trials. As of this writing, only the Gortex ligament has received a general device release from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\r"

The intracapsular pressure in straight neutral position of the hip exceeded normal hip pressure in all cases. Patients with an intracapsular pressure greater than 80 mm Hg had a low scintimetric rate, indicating a risk for segmental collapse of the femoral head. Intracapsular tamponade may contribute to the development of segmental collapse in some patients with nondisplaced femoral neck fracture, but further investigations are needed to determine whether evacuation of the hemarthrosis should be recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective review of records of 26 patients with nonunion of the humeral shaft revealed several factors frequently associated with the development of nonunion. The fractures were transverse and short oblique and treated per primam with hanging casts or open reduction. Surgical fixation was unstable. The types of nonunion were atrophic in 19 patients, hypertrophic in five patients, and synovial pseudarthrosis in two patients. Twenty-four of 26 nonunions (92%) treated with bone grafts and rigid internal fixation healed in an average of 5.6 months. Overall, 47 surgical procedures, including prior procedures, were performed on these 26 nonunions. The average number of operations per patient was 1.8. Successful platings produced immobilization, consisting of an average of 6.8 points of cortical fixation above the nonunion and 7.1 cortices below. Rigid fixation was not obtained in the unsuccessful procedures. Unsuccessful platings were noted to have unstable fixation, with an average of 2.7 points of cortical fixation above the nonunion and 3.0 cortices below. Bone grafting was performed in only 55% of the unsuccessful platings. Optimal treatment of nonunions of the humeral shaft consists of resecting atrophic nonunions, shortening the bones, drilling sclerotic areas, and apposing bleeding diaphyseal surfaces; open reduction with internal fixation with a broad compression plate, including at least six points of cortical fixation above and below the nonunion; compression of the nonunion by means of interfragmentary lag screws, prestressing of the plate, dynamic compression by the plate, or direct compression by the external compression device; and autogeneic cancellous iliac bone grafts.\r"

Nine dogs were used for the study, six dogs received allografts and three received autografts. No tissue antigen matching was performed. All nine dogs were killed nine months after surgery. Necropsy examination revealed that the ACL was not present in three joints (one autograft, two allografts). The two autograft and four allograft ligaments available for mechanical testing sustained mean maximum loads that were 10% and 14%, respectively, of the mean maximum loads sustained by the contralateral ACL. Autoradiography indicated that cellular activity was more pronounced in the autograft specimens. Hydroxyproline uptake was 200% and 45% of normal in the autograft and allograft ligaments, respectively. Both autograft and allograft specimens were producing Type I collagen at the time of killing. Antidonor dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) antibody was detected in the synovial fluid taken at the time of killing from six of six dogs that received allografts and in zero of three dogs that received autografts.\r"

  ".W": "Orthopedic history vividly documents the continuing battle between restoring tissue stability and preserving functional mobility. Prolonged and uninterrupted rest, popularized by Hilton and Thomas, but promoted by many before them and subsequently continued by Jones, Orr, and others, assures healing. Contractures that permanently limit function are not an uncommon consequence. Hippocrates, Hunter, Lucas-Championniere, and David advocated judicious motion. Timing and the interpretation of the patient's pathologic state have proved to be the critical criteria. Modern antibiotics, antiinflammatory medications, acute surgical repair, and techniques that combine stability and early motion provide today's orthopedic surgeons' great versatility and capability. Despite these advantages the threat of contractures remains. The dictum \"rest until healed\" persists. Physiologic posturing of inflamed or swollen joints to minimize tissue strain introduces resting positions of 15 degrees plantar flexion at the ankle, and 30 degrees flexion at the knee and hip. These will be perpetuated by contractures if not actively counteracted by timely mobilizing procedures. Each of these joint positions is a serious deterrent to walking without stressful substitutive posturing, and the patient's ability to function is impaired.\r"

Seventeen obese and nine nonobese control prepubertal girls were studied. Biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold thickness were measured. Percentage of body fat (% BF) and total body fat (TBF) were calculated. Body fat distribution was assessed by analyzing the central (suprailiac, subscapular)/peripheral (biceps, triceps) ratios. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Serum glucose and insulin were measured and insulinogenic index (insulin/glucose) was calculated. Body fat anthropometric data and body fat distribution indexes were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in the obese group. The obese population presented significantly elevated values of glucose, insulin, and insulinogenic indexes (p less than 0.01-p less than 0.001). In the obese group, insulin showed significant positive correlations (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001) with biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds, % BF and TBF, whereas the insulinogenic index had positive correlations with suprailiac skinfold and TBF (p less than 0.05). Obese girls showed positive correlations between the body fat distribution indexes and insulin or insulinogenic indexes (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001). In prepubertal girls obesity is of the centripetal (central) type. This pattern has an important role in determining the alterations in the glucose-insulin homeostasis that characterize the childhood nutritional obesity.\r"

These results are likely to underestimate the true number of complaints because participants may be withdrawn (e.g., deaths, losses to follow-up, and refusals) before they ever complain of an adverse effect. However, survival analysis methods can be used to compare the distributions of \"time to first complaint\" in the active and placebo treatment groups, taking into account withdrawals. Participants in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial were monitored for possible adverse effects. On each follow-up visit they were asked whether they had had any of four conditions (blacking out, fatigue, depression, and bronchospasm) since their previous visit about 3 months earlier. The patients were followed for up to 30 months. For fatigue and bronchospasm, the complaint-free time was significantly longer in the placebo vs. active (propranolol) treatment group (P less than 0.005).\r"

  ".W": "Ibopamine, an oral dopaminergic and adrenergic agent, was given to 19 healthy men to investigate the effect of this dopamine analogue on carbohydrate metabolism. In a three-part study six subjects received ibopamine alone, seven subjects were pretreated with metoclopramide (a dopamine antagonist), and six subjects received phentolamine (an alpha-receptor antagonist) and propranolol (a beta-receptor antagonist) to study the specific mechanisms involved. In these single-blind, controlled, randomized studies, effects on fasting glucose, insulin, glucagon, and prolactin were evaluated. Ibopamine, 300 mg, produced a statistically significant increase in fasting glucose and insulin levels but had no effect on glucagon or prolactin levels. Pretreatment with metoclopramide or phentolamine did not block these effects, but pretreatment with propranolol significantly (P less than 0.05) blunted the increase in fasting glucose and insulin levels. These findings indicate that, unlike other dopaminergic agonists, administration of ibopamine results in increased glucose levels without affecting glucagon. The effect on glucose is mediated through stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

In a double-blind crossover study six normal male volunteers received single oral doses of cilazapril, 4 mg, captopril, 25 mg, enalapril, 10 mg, and placebo. The response of diastolic blood pressure to an intravenous infusion with increasing doses of angiotensin I (AT-I) (0.1 to 18 micrograms/min) was determined at control and up to 36 hours after oral drug intake. Additionally the response to AT-I was established before, during, and after cessation of a 15-day 2.5 mg/day cilazapril administration. The ACE inhibitors antagonized the AT-I effects and shifted the AT-I dose-effect curves rightward, whereas placebo was not effective. After single doses the effects of cilazapril and enalapril declined with a similar elimination half-life of approximately 4 hours; with captopril approximately 2 hours was observed. After multiple administration of cilazapril there was no evidence of cumulative effects. Cilazapril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that does not show pharmacodynamically relevant accumulation.\r"

Sodium repletion, on the other hand, increased urinary PGE2 and TXB2 in proportion to the rise in V, but reduced PRA and PAC. During both sodium diets PGE2 and TXB2 correlated positively with V and negatively with PRA. It is concluded that chronic sodium intake produces opposite changes in the renal prostaglandin and the renin-angiotensin systems.\r"

The treatment should be individualized when other patient characteristics indicate a preferred drug. When this is not the case, then a thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic, with the addition of a centrally acting alpha-agonist when needed to control blood pressure has been demonstrated to be effective. If the patient does not tolerate this, or if his blood pressure reduction is not satisfactory, then other drugs can be used effectively.\r"

ASA had a significant inhibitory effect on erythema from all 6 agents and also on edema from all substances except dimethyl sulfoxide. The mechanism of the effect may be a result of the inhibitory influence of ASA on prostaglandin bioformation.

Salbutamol from both delivery systems produced bronchodilation. The doses of salbutamol inhaled via the nebulizer and MDI producing maximal bronchodilation were established by cumulative dose-response curves. The contents of the nebulizer and MDI were inhaled four times a day, one system containing salbutamol and the other a placebo. Cross-over of salbutamol from one system to the other occurred every two weeks. There was no significant difference between the two delivery methods in daily peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), severity of symptoms, or extra bronchodilator usage. Two weekly laboratory assessments of spirometry, PEFR, and exercise tolerance also showed no significant differences. Careful assessment is recommended before the provision of domiciliary nebulizers.\r"

Biopsy was performed with Trucut or Surecut (modified Menghini) needles in 22 patients, and with both in 32 patients in order to compare the two types of needle. Definitive diagnosis was made in 46 patients (85 percent), of whom 41 had malignancy of various cell types, and five had benign lesions. Of the remaining eight, three had apical lesions, and two had consolidation distal to a proximal tumor. There was complete histologic agreement in 25 of 32 patients where biopsy was performed with both needles. Roentgenographic size of the lesion had relatively little influence on the diagnostic yield. Complications comprise moderate hemoptysis in one patient (2 percent), trivial hemoptysis or hemothorax in three, and symptomless pneumothorax in two which resolved spontaneously. We conclude that tissue core needle biopsy of thoracic lesions under ultrasound guidance is an accurate and safe technique which provides specimens adequate for routine histologic examination. The diagnostic yield from Trucut and Surecut biopsies is comparable.\r"

Fifty-nine percent of them remained respirator-dependent from the onset. Forty-one percent became respirator-dependent at an average of 18 years after onset of polio. Overall, they lost an average of 1.9 percent of vital capacity per year. All used mouth intermittent positive pressure ventilation as their predominant mode of respiratory assistance for an average of 14.5 years. Four of them who had no measurable vital capacity used only mouth intermittent positive pressure ventilation 24 hours per day. Of the 66 who had no significant tolerance off 24 hours per day respiratory assistance, only six had tracheostomies. Despite severe physical disability and dependence on artificial ventilation, the majority of these persons have married, have been gainfully employed, and lead useful lives in society.\r"

Although cross-sectional studies have not clarified the precise etiologic links, they have established that NSBH and atopy are linked to the occurrence of asthma and to each other. In children, evidence supports the hypothesis both that atopy is a cause of asthma and that atopic diathesis is the most frequent trigger for NSHB. In adults, the associations are more complex, although in a small subset findings are similar to those in children. It is concluded that further general population-based or clinical epidemiologic cross-sectional studies based on questionnaires will contribute little more to explaining these associations. Criteria are presented for the further application of case-control studies to maximize their use in examining hypotheses of asthma etiology.\r"

Lung growth appears to be relatively normal in most children with asthma but is reduced throughout childhood and adolescence in those with severe and persistent symptoms. It is not known if this reflects a failure to reach full growth or reversible bronchoconstriction. During adult life, clinical asthma is associated with a slight increase in the rate of decline in FEV1. In the middle-aged and elderly smoker it is virtually impossible to separate chronic bronchitis and asthma. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be associated with an increase in the rate of decline of lung function but it is not clear if this is a result of airway disease due to smoking or a true risk factor. Further research needs are identified.\r"

Hyposensitization with bacterial antigens is no longer an accepted treatment. Bacterial infection of the nasal sinuses and bronchi may exacerbate an asthmatic attack and in some cases patients benefit from antibiotic therapy. However, bacterial infections in asthma and allergic rhinitis do not always require treatment and if treated this is not sufficient alone to reverse symptoms. Opinions vary as to the importance of viral infections. There is evidence that the immunologic consequences of intrabronchial infection with Aspergillus fumigatus may cause exacerbations of asthma.\r"

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may be confirmed in patients with varying severity of asthma from minimal to corticosteroid-dependent and has been reported to occur in approximately 10 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis. It has been documented in infants and children, the geriatric patient with asthma, in the presence of a normal chest roentgenogram, in the corticosteroid-dependent asthmatic patient, and on a familial basis. The pathogenesis of ABPA is unclear, but may be related to the array of immunologic abnormalities including: elevation of total serum IgE, not all of which is directed to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af); elevated serum IgE-Af, IgG-Af and IgA-Af; precipitating antibodies to Af; hyperreactivity of peripheral blood basophils to Af and other molds; and sensitized lymphocytes.

In allergic individuals, inhalation of specific allergens leads to mast cell degranulation and release of mediators. Many of the pathologic features of asthma may be attributed to the effects of mast cell-derived mediators. Their role is clear in allergic asthma and the presence of mast cell derived mediators in the plasma of individuals with exercise-induced and nocturnal asthma suggests involvement in other forms of asthma as well.\r"

This article discusses where the primary problem might lie, starting with the assumption that it is likely to be in neurohumoral control, bronchial smooth muscle or cellular dysfunction with increased release of mediators. The weight of the evidence suggests that the latter is most likely. If true, the question of why this occurs still remains.\r"

This review describes the questionnaires prepared by the British Medical Research Council and the American Thoracic Society and suggests modifications.\r"

Allergen challenge is also used for diagnosis of specific IgE-mediated asthma and evaluation of the effect of immunotherapy. A number of factors influence the result of the challenge test including the selection of patients, criteria for carrying out the challenge test, a number of technical factors concerning the challenge, the dosing schedule, pulmonary function tests carried out and analysis of the data. All these factors have to be taken into consideration before reproducible challenge tests can be performed. Detailed description of the equipment and procedures used and inclusion criteria for the patients should be included in all publications concerning challenge tests in order to be able to compare results from different laboratories. Each clinic or laboratory needs to perform reproducibility studies on bronchial challenge testing procedures and equipment used in their clinic.\r"

Insulin secretion appeared significantly reduced after 0600 h. No correlations were observed between counterregulatory hormones and insulin secretion during this period. Plasma glucose remained stable throughout the study. An increased peripheral sensitivity to insulin after 0600 h is suggested to explain reduced secretion of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "A 55-yr-old woman with a history of Graves' disease experienced attacks of postprandial hypoglycemia for 6 yr. An insulinoma could not be confirmed by repeated fasting tests and by surgical pancreas revision. Extracted pancreatic insulin was chemically normal. Fasting plasma total insulin (1.22 nM = 183 microU/ml) and proinsulin (0.48 nM) were elevated and greatly increased after oral glucose. Glucose-clamp studies revealed delayed insulin clearance. Plasma free-insulin levels were normal. Insulin-binding antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay with human insulin as ligand but not with pork or beef insulins. Analysis with a modified ELISA suggested a monotypic and monoclonal human insulin autoantibody, which showed a restriction to the lambda-light chain. T-lymphocytes (predominantly helper) demonstrated increased responsiveness to beef, pork, and human insulins by proliferation assay. A T-lymphocyte line showed exclusively human insulin specificity. All this indicated cellular and humoral anti-human insulin autoimmunities. Clinically, the cause of hypoglycemia associated with elevated total insulin and proinsulin was misdiagnosed as atypical insulinoma. The study of total and free plasma insulin levels and sensitive antibody assays specific to human insulin were necessary to correctly diagnose autoimmune hypoglycemia.\r"

The patients were characterized by sex, age, and seasonal variation at onset of diabetes mellitus. During the first 36 mo of the disease, an evaluation was performed for basal C-peptide, HbA1c, and insulin dose per kilogram. Total remission was interpreted as complete discontinuation of insulin therapy for at least 1 wk while still metabolically well controlled, and partial remission was interpreted as an insulin need that was less than or equal to 50% of the insulin dose at discharge from the hospital. During the first 18 mo of the disease, 12.3% of the patients entered total remission (median 6 mo), and 18.3% of the patients entered partial remission (median 6 mo). Patients entering remission had significantly higher basal C-peptide levels than those who did not. Sex, age, and initial HbA1c levels did not influence the frequency of remission.\r"

Both male (N = 57) and female (N = 29) diabetic patients with normal urinary sediment showed an increased excretion of albumin compared with the respective nondiabetic subjects, and male diabetic patients also had an increased IgG excretion. No consistent difference was found in urinary beta 2-microglobulin concentration between the diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. In all, 19.5% of the diabetic subjects with normal urinary sediment (12 men, 5 women) showed urinary albumin concentration exceeding the highest value (35 mg/24 h) found in nondiabetic subjects without renal disease. The urinary excretion of albumin in the diabetic subjects was not associated with the presence of hypertension or coronary heart disease or with the fasting blood glucose or serum insulin levels measured at diagnosis of diabetes. In male diabetic subjects with urinary albumin excretion greater than 35 mg/24 h, a reduced creatinine clearance was found, suggesting the presence of structural damage associated with diabetic nephropathy. The early increase of urinary albumin excretion in type II diabetic patients may be mostly functional in nature. However, some patients may have structural renal damage associated with diabetic nephropathy present at diagnosis.\r"

The purpose of the study was to 1) systematically study the insulin response to several different high-starch foods, 2) determine whether this insulin response could be predicted by the glucose response, and 3) determine whether the glucose response could be predicted by the physical structure and digestibility of the ingested carbohydrate. Each subject served as his own control. Carbohydrate was given in the form of potatoes, bread, oatmeal, rice, lentils, kidney beans, cornflakes, high-amylose corn muffins, and low-amylose corn muffins. Bread, oatmeal, rice, lentils, kidney beans, and high-amylose corn muffins resulted in a significantly lower glucose area than 50 g glucose, and the glucose response generally could be predicted by the physical structure and the known digestibility of the ingested carbohydrate. The insulin rise was statistically significantly greater than would be predicted from the glucose response for oatmeal, lentils, kidney beans, and high-amylose corn muffins. Although not statistically significant, the mean was greater than predicted for every other food except potatoes when the insulin response to 50 g glucose was used as a standard. These results indicate that the insulin response cannot be predicted by the glucose response.\r"

The discovery of insulin and other drugs for lowering hyperglycemia have certainly reduced mortality from acute complications of diabetes and improved the quality of life of many diabetic patients. Recent advances in research into the etiology and natural history of diabetes have increased our knowledge about different types of diabetes to such an extent that primary prevention of diabetes mellitus is becoming a reality. Until now, few studies have attempted to test measures for primary prevention of diabetes. Therefore, the data supporting the possibility for primary prevention are largely indirect and need to be tested in preventive trials or in community-based prevention programs. We believe, however, that the time is right to start action in populations in which the prevalence of diabetes is known to have clearly increased recently. We summarize the evidence that can be used as the scientific basis of primary prevention of diabetes mellitus.\r"
