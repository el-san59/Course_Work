  ".W": "Genetic analysis of protein secretion in Escherichia coli has identified secY/prlA and secA as components of the secretory apparatus. We have examined the roles of the secY(prlA) gene product (an integral membrane protein) and the soluble secA gene product in translocation of OmpA and alkaline phosphatase precursors in an in vitro system. The protein translocation defect of the secY24 mutation was recently demonstrated in vitro as was its suppression by an S300 extract. We show here that the extract was essentially inactive in SecY24 suppression when SecA protein was removed from it by immunoaffinity chromatography. Furthermore, purified SecA protein suppressed the SecY24 defect. Preincubation of the inactivated SecY24 membrane vesicles either with S300 containing SecA or with purified SecA protein reconstituted the membranes and restored the translocation activity when assayed in the absence of additional soluble proteins. These results suggest that the SecY24 translocation defect is suppressed by SecA interacting, directly or indirectly, with SecY24 on the cytoplasmic membrane.\r"

Combinations of the lac operator with other promoter sequences, however, differ vastly in the level of repression. The data presented show that the extent of repression is determined largely by the rates of complex formation of the competing systems operator-repressor and promoter-RNA polymerase and by the rate at which RNA polymerase clears the promoter. Moreover, up to 70-fold differences in the level of repression were found when the operator was placed in different positions within the promoter sequence. A kinetic model is proposed that explains the observed effects and that allows predictions on promoters controlled by negatively acting elements.\r"

Previous studies indicated that SecB promotes the export of the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) by preventing premature folding of the precursor MBP in the cytoplasm into an export-incompetent form. In this study, SecB has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be a soluble, cytoplasmic, multimeric protein composed of identical 17-kDa subunits. SecB was required for efficient in vitro translocation of MBP into inverted membrane vesicles. The addition of purified SecB to an in vitro system prepared from SecB- cells significantly enhanced MBP translocation. The purified protein also quantitatively retarded folding of precursor MBP into a stable, protease-resistant conformation in the absence of membranes. Finally, the inclusion of excess purified SecB in a SecB+ in vitro system significantly prolonged the time in which precursor MBP remained competent for posttranslational import into membrane vesicles.\r"

  ".U": "89057866\r", 
  ".W": "We have devised a simple and efficient cDNA cloning strategy that overcomes many of the difficulties encountered in obtaining full-length cDNA clones of low-abundance mRNAs. In essence, cDNAs are generated by using the DNA polymerase chain reaction technique to amplify copies of the region between a single point in the transcript and the 3' or 5' end. The minimum information required for this amplification is a single short stretch of sequence within the mRNA to be cloned. Since the cDNAs can be produced in one day, examined by Southern blotting the next, and readily cloned, large numbers of full-length cDNA clones of rare transcripts can be rapidly produced. Moreover, separation of amplified cDNAs by gel electrophoresis allows precise selection by size prior to cloning and thus facilitates the isolation of cDNAs representing variant mRNAs, such as those produced by alternative splicing or by the use of alternative promoters. The efficacy of this method was demonstrated by isolating cDNA clones of mRNA from int-2, a mouse gene that expresses four different transcripts at low abundance, the longest of which is approximately 2.9 kilobases. After less than 0.05% of the cDNAs produced had been screened, 29 independent int-2 clones were isolated. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 3' and 5' ends of all four int-2 mRNAs were accurately represented by these clones.\r"

An alignment of the sequences of the L and M subunits from four purple bacteria, one green bacterium, and the D1 and D2 subunits of a photosystem II-containing green alga is presented. The residues that are conserved in all six species are shown in relation to the structure of Rb. sphaeroides and their possible role in the function of the reaction center is discussed. A method is presented for characterizing the exposure of alpha-helices to the membrane based on the periodicity of conserved residues. This method may prove useful for modeling the three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins.\r"

The beta tumor cell (beta TC) lines maintain the features of differentiated beta cells for about 50 passages in culture. The cells produce both proinsulin I and II and efficiently process each into mature insulin, in a manner comparable to normal beta cells in isolated islets. Electron microscopy reveals typical beta-cell type secretory granules, in which insulin is stored. Insulin secretion is inducible up to 30-fold by glucose, although with a lower threshold for maximal stimulation than that for normal beta cells. beta TC lines can be repeatedly derived from primary beta-cell tumors that heritably arise in the transgenic mice. Thus, targeted expression of an oncogene with a cell-specific regulatory element can be used both to immortalize a rare cell type and to provide a selection for the maintenance of its differentiated phenotype.\r"

For examination of this problem, monoclonal antibody specifically directed to PIP2 was injected into cells. This antibody bound to endogenous PIP2 and so inhibited its intracellular breakdown. Injection of this antibody into ras-transformed cells cultured in the presence of serum caused reversible and dose-dependent decrease in proliferation and reversion of the cell morphology to that of the normal phenotype. The antibody also inhibited the proliferation of src- and erbB-transformed cells but had no effect on the proliferation of untransformed or myc-transformed cells. These results show that the breakdown of PIP2 is involved in the signaling pathways for mitogenesis in cells transformed by oncogenes such as ras, src, and erbB.\r"

When the low-Km (high affinity), cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase was isolated from such lysates by blue dextran-Sepharose chromatography, the specific activity of the enzyme was increased an average of 11-fold over similarly processed control platelets. The increase in the low-Km, cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited when platelets were incubated with the protein kinase inhibitor H-8 prior to treatment with forskolin, suggesting that the stimulation of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity involved a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. When intact platelets that had been prelabeled with 32Pi were treated with forskolin and the low-Km, cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase was isolated by blue dextran-Sepharose chromatography, a protein of 110,000 kDa was phosphorylated. By using a monospecific antiserum to the purified phosphodiesterase, this protein was shown to be the low-Km, cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase by electrophoretic transfer blot (Western blot) analysis and by immunoprecipitation. The stable prostacyclin analog iloprost also stimulated the low-Km cAMP phosphodiesterase activity about 2-fold and caused phosphorylation of the enzyme. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the low-Km, cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase may be an important regulatory mechanism for this enzyme in platelets.\r"

We have also derived the sequence of the DHFR portion of the gene, by amplification using polymerase chain reaction, for the pyrimethamine-sensitive clone 3D7 and the pyrimethamine-resistant strains V-1, K-1, Csl-2, and Palo-alto. The deduced protein sequence of the resistant DHFR portion of the enzyme from HB3 contained a single amino acid difference from the pyrimethamine-sensitive clone 3D7. It is highly likely that this difference is involved in the mechanism of drug resistance in HB3. The sequence of the DHFR gene from other pyrimethamine-resistant strains contains the same amino acid difference from the sensitive clone 3D7. However, they all differ at one other site that may influence pyrimethamine resistance. The DHFR-TS gene is present as a single copy on chromosome 4 in all pyrimethamine-sensitive and pyrimethamine-resistant isolates tested. Therefore, the molecular basis of pyrimethamine resistance in the parasites tested is not amplification of the DHFR-TS gene.\r"

Parasites having a mutation from Thr-108/Ser-108 to Asn-108 in DHFR-TS are resistant to the drug. The Asn-108 mutation occurs in a region analogous to the C alpha-helix bordering the active site cavity of bacterial, avian, and mammalian enzymes. Additional point mutations (Asn-51 to Ile-51 and Cys-59 to Arg-59) are associated with increased pyrimethamine resistance and also occur at sites expected to border the active site cavity. Analogies with known inhibitor/enzyme structures from other organisms suggest that the point mutations occur where pyrimethamine contacts the enzyme and may act by inhibiting binding of the drug.\r"

We have constructed plasmid pIP11, in which the dnaQ gene is fused to the strong tac (trp-lac) promoter. Enhanced synthesis of the epsilon subunit stimulated by isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the inducer of tac, prevents expression of the mutator phenotype of recA441 and markedly decreases the frequency of UV-induced mutations.

This system is based upon the use of mammalian cell lines containing mutant shuttle vector genes integrated into chromosomal DNA. The target for mutation was the Escherichia coli gpt gene, coding for the enzyme xanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT; EC 2.4.2.22). We have previously isolated a large number of cell lines containing mutant gpt genes with single base changes. From these lines, revertants were selected on the basis of the reappearance of GPT activity. In general, the frequency of revertants was below 10(-7). The gpt genes were recovered from 32 revertants and sequenced to determine the nature of the base changes associated with reversion. In the majority of the revertants, there was a base change within the originally mutated codon, leading to either restoration of the wild-type amino acid sequence or substitution of a different amino acid at the original mutated site. In no case did reversion of a base substitution mutant involve an amino acid residue other than that affected by the original mutation. The results have demonstrated a number of sites in the GPT polypeptide at which amino acid substitutions are compatible with enzyme activity and one site at which the loss of an amino acid is compatible with enzyme activity. This study establishes reversion analysis as a sensitive molecular assay for mutagenesis in mammalian cells.\r"

Chem. 263, 6829-6835; Lu, A.-L. & Chang, D.Y. (1988) Genetics 118, 593-600]. One is the mutHLS-dependent, methyl-directed pathway that recognizes a variety of mismatches and repairs the unmethylated strand of DNA heteroduplexes that are hemimethylated at d(GATC) sequences. The other pathway appears to be specific for A-G mispairs, yields C.G base pairs exclusively, and is independent of the presence of d(GATC) sites. Analyses of cell-free extracts prepared from E. coli mutY strains and isogenic parents have demonstrated that the mutY gene product is involved in the methyl-independent pathway, which converts A-G mispairs to C.G pairs. The specificity of this activity is consistent with the mutator phenotype associated with the mutY locus, which generates G.C----T.A transversions [Nghiem, Y., Cabrera, M., Cupples, C.G. & Miller, J.H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2709-2713]. We propose that the mutY product functions at a late stage of a pathway that excludes A-G mispairs during chromosome replication and that involves the function of the mutT gene product. This model suggests that the mutT function acts at an early stage of this pathway to exclude A-G mismatches where the adenine resides on the template DNA strand. A-G mispairs that persist after passage of the replication fork would contain guanine on the template strand and thus be processed to C.G base pairs by the mutY-dependent repair system.\r"

They also raise the possibility of adverse side effects of GM-CSF therapy in patients whose malignant cells may be directly stimulated by this molecule and suggest a previously unanticipated role of GM-CSF gene activation in the evolution of solid tumors and in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the frequency of mutations activating RAS oncogenes in human lymphoid malignancies, including B- and T-cell-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. By the polymerase chain reaction/oligonucleotide hybridization method, DNA from 178 cases was analyzed for activating mutations involving codons 12 and 61 of the HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes and codon 13 of the NRAS gene. Mutations involving codons 12 or 13 of the NRAS gene were detected in 6 of 33 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6/33, 18%), whereas no mutations were found in non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Direct nucleotide sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction products showed that the mutations involved a G----A transition in five of the six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. In four cases the mutations seemed to occur in only a fraction of the neoplastic cells, and one case displayed two distinct NRAS mutations, most likely present in two distinct cell populations. These results indicate the following: (i) RAS oncogenes are not found in all types of human malignancies, (ii) significant differences in the frequency of RAS mutations can be found among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue, (iii) in lymphoid neoplasms the NRAS mutation correlates with the most undifferentiated acute lymphocytic leukemia phenotype, and (iv) NRAS mutations present in only a fraction of malignant cells may result from either the selective loss or the acquisition of mutated alleles during tumor development.\r"

  ".W": "To work toward an understanding of the mechanisms of cancer progression, we have followed the changes in expression of several genes in rat mammary carcinomas during the development of invasion. Tumors were induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and serially transplanted to isogeneic rats. Gene expression in individual cells was followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. We show that invading cells do not express the same genes as the primary tumor or normal adult mammary gland but are similar to the primitive mammary duct cells present in late embryos. In the most advanced tumors, the most fundamental epithelial characteristic, polarity, is lost. Relative to the mechanism of invasion, we observe that the basal lamina, often thinner than normal, always coats the strands of invading cells and may be entirely absent from single invasive cells only. These observations suggest that the basal lamina ultimately disappears because of reduced expression of the genes or the failure to assemble the components. In these tumors it is the progressive alteration in gene expression rather than the enzymatic breakdown of the basal lamina that leads to invasion. These results show that the most important aspect of cancer progression is the progressive alteration of gene expression. They also raise questions about the mechanism that causes tumor cells to retrace the steps in their differentiation.\r"

This study shows PDGF receptors on an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line, C 643, that was found to express thyroglobulin mRNA, confirming its origin from thyroid epithelium. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA hybridized with a human PDGF B-type receptor cDNA probe revealed a 5.4-kilobase transcript in the C 643 cells. The existence of receptor protein on the cell surface was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy with a PDGF receptor monoclonal antibody. Binding experiments with 125I-labeled dimeric forms of PDGF indicated that the cells contain B-, but not A-, type PDGF receptors. The addition of PDGF to C 643 membranes in the presence of [32P]ATP induced phosphorylation of the receptor. A polyclonal PDGF B-type receptor peptide antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate a receptor protein from metabolically labeled C 643 cells; the receptor was found to be 5-10 kDa larger than that in normal human fibroblasts. Removal of N-linked carbohydrates using endoglycosidase H resulted in deglycosylated receptor proteins of similar size in C 643 cells and fibroblasts, indicating differences in glycosylation patterns of the two receptor proteins. The aberrant expression of receptors might be crucial in tumor development by conferring a selective growth advantage to the cancer cells.\r"

Complete DNA sequences of ipaB, -C, and -D were determined. The proteins predicted (62, 42, and 37 kDa, respectively) from the nucleotide sequences lack a signal-peptide sequence. Hydrophilic segments of the IpaB and IpaC proteins were found to overlap known epitopic domains of these membrane antigens. Analysis of total RNA demonstrated that temperature control of ipa gene expression occurs at the level of transcription. Multiple mRNA bands were detected by using ipa gene fragments as hybridization probes, and a putative transcript map for the ipa genes was constructed. Comparison of this map with the DNA sequence reveals a complex system of ipa gene regulation.\r"

The method employs L-[1-14C]leucine as the radiolabeled tracer. A comprehensive model has been designed that takes into account intracellular and extracellular spaces, intracellular compartmentation of leucine, and the possibility of recycling of unlabeled leucine derived from steady-state degradation of protein into the precursor pool for protein synthesis. We have evaluated the degree of recycling by measuring the ratio of the steady-state precursor pool distribution space for labeled leucine to that of unlabeled leucine. The values obtained were 0.58 in whole brain and 0.47 in liver. These results indicate that there is significant recycling of unlabeled amino acids derived from steady-state protein degradation in both tissues. Any method for the determination of rates of cerebral protein synthesis in vivo with labeled tracers that depends on estimation of precursor pool specific activity in tissue from measurements in plasma must take this recycling into account.\r"

LTP induction resulted in a considerably larger potentiation of non-NMDA as opposed to NMDA receptor-related currents. Increasing the size of postsynaptic potentials with greater stimulation currents or with paired-pulse facilitation produced opposite effects; i.e., those aspects of the response dependent on NMDA receptors increased to a greater degree than did those components mediated by non-NMDA receptors. These results pose new constraints on hypotheses about the locus and nature of LTP and strongly suggest that postsynaptic modifications are part of the effect.\r"

Neuropathic fractures occur less often than plantar ulcers but usually result in major structural deformities of the feet. The primary risk factors for plantar ulceration are believed to be loss of protective sensation and the presence of high plantar pressures. Principal etiologic factors in the development of neuropathic fractures are hypothesized to be loss of protective sensation and bone demineralization. Major diabetic foot injuries are preventable by the use of comprehensive screening examinations and patient education. Patients at highest risk of injury should be seen more frequently and receive more extensive therapy. Successful management of plantar ulcerations is dependent on reduction of pressures under the foot and control of infection. Neuropathic fractures require long-term immobilization to promote healing followed by careful monitoring after removal of casts to prevent reinjury. Future research needs include prospective studies on risk factors and validation of treatment techniques.\r"

Several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) are subunits of this complex that assembles on the pre-mRNA. Although the U1 snRNP is known to recognize the 5' splice site, its roles in spliceosome formation and splice site alignment have been unclear. A new affinity purification method for the spliceosome is described which has provided insight into the very early stages of spliceosome formation in a yeast in vitro splicing system. Surprisingly, the U1 snRNP initially recognizes sequences at or near both splice junctions in the intron. This interaction must occur before the other snRNP's (U2, U4, U5, and U6) can join the complex. The results suggest that interaction of the two splice site regions occurs at an early stage of spliceosome formation and is probably mediated by U1 snRNP and perhaps other factors.\r"

  ".W": "D-galactose-binding (or chemoreceptor) protein of Escherichia coli serves as an initial component for both chemotaxis towards galactose and glucose and high-affinity active transport of the two sugars. Well-refined x-ray structures of the liganded forms of the wild-type and a mutant protein isolated from a strain defective in chemotaxis but fully competent in transport have provided a molecular view of the sugar-binding site and of a site for interacting with the Trg transmembrane signal transducer. The geometry of the sugar-binding site, located in the cleft between the two lobes of the bilobate protein, is novel in that it is designed for tight binding and sequestering of either the alpha or beta anomer of the D-stereoisomer of the 4-epimers galactose and glucose. Binding specificity and affinity are conferred primarily by polar planar side-chain residues that form intricate networks of cooperative and bidentate hydrogen bonds with the sugar substrates, and secondarily by aromatic residues that sandwich the pyranose ring. Each of the pairs of anomeric hydroxyls and epimeric hydroxyls is recognized by a distinct Asp residue. The site for interaction with the transducer is about 18 A from the sugar-binding site. Mutation of Gly74 to Asp at this site, concomitant with considerable changes in the local ordered water structures, contributes to the lack of productive interaction with the transmembrane signal transducer.\r"

Reversal of resistance is associated with increased chloroquine accumulation in the parasite, probably because of inhibition of a putative chloroquine efflux pump. When owl monkeys (Aotus lemurinus lemurinus) infected with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum were treated with chloroquine plus desipramine, their parasitemias were rapidly suppressed. Desipramine was found to be one of the most effective compounds yet described for the reversal of chloroquine resistance both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

To address this issue, normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells were exposed to c-myb sense and antisense synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, and the effects on hematopoietic colony formation and maturation were examined. Exposure of these cells to c-myb antisense, oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a decrease in both colony size and number, without apparent effect on the maturation of residual colony cells. Exposure to c-myb sense, or irrelevant antisense, oligonucleotides had no such effect. These results show that (i) c-myb plays a critical role in regulating normal human hematopoiesis and (ii) the combined use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and hematopoietic cell culture techniques will provide a powerful tool for studying the role of proteins encoded by proto-oncogenes, or other specific genes, in normal human hematopoiesis.\r"

The efficacy of two tissues adhesives, fibrin adhesive sealant and cyanoacrylate polymer, as adjunctive or the sole means of effecting dural closure, was studied. In vitro analysis of repair techniques was accomplished using fresh human cadaveric dura. Uniform 4 mm defects were created, repaired using various techniques, and then subjected to pressurization testing. Defects repaired with suture alone leaked at pressurization levels within the physiologic range, while those supplemented with tissue adhesives failed at higher pressurization levels. In vitro testing, accomplished in white New Zealand rabbits, supported this conclusion. Histologic sections obtained from dura treated with fibrin adhesive sealant demonstrated minimal inflammatory response, while those sections obtained at the site of dural repair augmented with cyanoacrylate polymer featured significant inflammatory responses, including dural thinning, gliosis, and cortical necrosis. Results indicate that a new substance, fibrin adhesive sealant, appears to have application as an adjunctive means of effecting dural closure.\r"

  ".W": "Pelvic floor physiology is poorly understood. The funnel shape of the pelvic floor and anal canal is uniquely developed to provide discriminatory continence of gas, liquid, and solid. Proximally, the pelvic floor consists of the pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus muscles. Distally, the anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external sphincter muscles. The anorectal ring is situated between the proximal pelvic floor and the distal anal canal. It is the site of the puborectalis muscle, which is anatomically, neurologically, and functionally merged with the deep portion of the external sphincter muscle. It is at this site that unique forces act to create both a flutter valve and the anorectal angle with the flap valve. Extrinsic pressures at this level reinforce both the flap valve and the flutter valve. Intrinsic pressures are generated by all of the surrounding muscles to produce a high-pressure zone. These factors are critical, but many other factors, such as rectal capacity, compliance, colonic transit, motility, and sensory mechanisms, also interact in a complex way to provide normal continence and defecation. Not surprisingly, no single test allows a complete assessment of the interactions of all these factors. Nevertheless, analysis of components thought to be important in pelvic floor physiology has contributed significantly to the understanding of normal as well as abnormal physiology. Although clinical evaluation continues to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis of pelvic floor disorders, anorectal physiological testing has contributed significantly to our understanding of the dynamics of the pelvic floor. With the refinement of existing techniques and the addition of new investigative tools, it is anticipated that knowledge of pelvic floor physiology will continue to grow.\r"

There seems no doubt that following rectopexy there is an increased tendency to constipation.\r"

Most of the maneuvers are relatively esoteric and can be performed successfully only by the few surgeons who have developed the specialized techniques. It is recommended, therefore, that the surgeon who is less experienced with rectal prolapse adopt one of the standard operations. A rectopexy or suspension procedure without resection can be performed safely with good results, low morbidity, and a low mortality rate. Anterior resection with or without sacral fixation, an operation familiar to most surgeons, also offers an excellent cure rate. The Thiersch-type approach should probably be reserved for those patients who cannot tolerate laparotomy. The material chosen should be one of the commercially available synthetic products; wire should not be used. The Silastic-impregnated Dacron prosthesis for this operation has some potential benefit, especially for the incontinent patient. Results of further studies are awaited.\r"

One may explain such persistence of anastomotic leakage on the basis of the dynamic effect that multiple factors have on the healing of an anastomosis. Awareness of these factors and proper precautions by the surgeon can make a high-risk anastomosis less prone to leakage. The intracolonic bypass procedure is an alternative to a temporary colostomy. It does not prevent an anastomotic dehiscence but can prevent anastomotic leakage with its associated complications in those situations where dehiscence is most likely to occur.\r"

For the purposes of management, the large bowel can be considered as colon and rectum. Minor colon injuries can be repaired primarily; management of major colon injuries or injuries associated with multiple organ involvement, significant blood loss, or massive contamination should be individualized. Diversion or exteriorization remains the gold standard of treatment when there is any doubt. Rectal injury should be repaired when feasible and diverted and the presacral space drained. Distal rectal washout is of proven merit. Antibiotics provide an important adjunct to therapy. They should be initiated early (preoperatively), ended quickly (12 to 72 hours postoperatively), and provide a broad spectrum of coverage. The treatment of established infection should be guided by bacterial culture. Postoperatively, aggressive support is important for a good outcome. The significant incidence of complications even in the face of optimal management demands continued vigilance and aggressive intervention by the operating surgeon.\r"

With the wealth of experience now available, the operation of ileal pouch with anal anastomosis must be considered as an option in treating the young or well-motivated patient. Screening of families in whom polyposis coli has been found can prevent colon cancer developing. For this group of patients, who may be totally asymptomatic, to be able to offer a reconstructive operation may make it easier for such patients to accept colectomy. The value of consultation between medical and surgical gastroenterologists in order to time surgery is vital, and an exact histologic diagnosis in inflammatory bowel disease may prevent the potential disaster of constructing an ileal pouch in a patient with Crohn's disease. The construction of a pouch is not difficult, being made up of several familiar surgical steps in an unfamiliar setting. However, it is a long operation, frequently taking more than 4 hours, and mucosal protectomy can be rather awkward. For these reasons and the problems with patient counseling, we believe ileal pouch with anal anastomosis operations should be performed at referral centers. We still have to decide on the best type of pouch to use, but it is encouraging that better antibiotics, safer anesthesia, and new techniques such as the intraluminal bypass tube and rectal sleeve dissection have helped to make this operation more successful for a greater number of patients.\r"

Radical radiation has shown to be effective for the control of local disease, but treatment complications have been cause for concern. Reported 5-year survival rates have ranged from 40 to 80 per cent. Treatment with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy results in a response rate of about 90 per cent and a projected 5-year survival rate of 83 per cent. Strong proponents exist for the combination chemoradiation, whereas others favor radical radiation therapy. Only a prospective clinical trial will determine the treatment of choice.

Furthermore, contact Nd:YAG laser therapy definitely appears to be efficient and safe and compares favorably with other therapies available.

All patients were graded on the basis of test results from five studies: (1) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, (2) fat-stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), (3) NBT-bentiromide PABA test, (4) 72-hour fecal fat test, and (5) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients with CP were graded as either mild/moderate or severe by means of a scoring system that we devised and have previously reported. Nineteen patients were graded as mild/moderate and 43 patients were graded as severe. The endocrine function of non-beta and beta islet cells was compared by assessing release of PP after fat and by release of insulin during OGTT. Release of PP was depressed in 58%, and the depressed output was found in only patients with a severe grade of CP. Forty-four of 62 patients (71%) with CP had abnormal OGTT findings; the distribution of this abnormality was not greatly different between mild/moderate and severe grades. Depressed release of insulin was seen in 58% (36 of 62)--more commonly in patients with a severe grade (10%) but also in 32% of patients with a mild/moderate grade. A subset of patients with CP sustains early beta-cell dysfunction. We conclude that decreased output of PP is a more reliable measure of functional deficit and stage in CP.\r"

  ".W": "Of 522 patients with hyperparathyroidism operated on from 1973 to 1987 at our institution, there were seven (1.3%), each with an ectopic, hyperfunctioning mediastinal parathyroid adenoma, who required median sternotomy. In three of these seven patients, the tumor was located in the aorticopulmonary window. A 61-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism had a preoperative thallium-technetium subtraction scan that showed thallium uptake at the base of the heart without any uptake in the neck. After further workup and without prior neck exploration, a parathyroid adenoma was found in the aorticopulmonary window through a median sternotomy. Six months later, serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone values remain normal. Two other cases of parathyroid adenoma in the aorticopulmonary window are presented. Of these two patients, the thallium scan was a key element in the immediate mediastinal exploration of one, who was transferred from another hospital comatose and intubated, in acute hypercalcemic crisis. Since mediastinal parathyroid tumors that necessitate median sternotomy occur in less than 2% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, we do not advocate routine preoperative localization studies before an initial cervical operation; localization, however, may be justified in selected cases, such as in critically ill patients or in instances of acute hyperparathyroidism, when the first operation needs to be curative.\r"

  ".W": "In 6307 cervicotomies for thyroid and parathyroid excision, 33 cases of nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve were identified (0.52%). The anomaly was observed in 31 cases from 4921 dissections on the right side (0.63%) and in two cases from 4673 dissections on the left side (0.04%). Of the 31 patients who were initially seen with this anomaly on the right side, no innominate (brachiocephalic) artery was found; the right common carotid artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. The aberrant subclavian artery could always be felt against the vertebral column behind the esophagus. The two patients with the anomaly on the left side had a right aortic arch associated with situs inversus viscerum. In one case of invasive thyroid carcinoma, the nerve had to be sacrificed. In all of the other patients, postoperative laryngoscopic findings were normal. The nervous anomaly was of vascular anomaly origin in all cases. Predisposing factors for its onset during aortic arch development are discussed. Before surgical treatment, the diagnosis may only be made if vascular anomaly is suspected. Impairment of swallowing is the only clinical symptom to be looked for. The retroesophageal subclavian artery may be detected on chest x-ray films (20%) or by the compression and distortion of the esophagus shown during barium swallow tests (97%). Although rare on the right side and exceptional on the left, an aberrant nonrecurrent pathway for the inferior laryngeal nerve represents a major surgical risk. This is an additional argument in favor of systematic dissection of the inferior laryngeal nerve during thyroid or parathyroid excision.\r"

  ".W": "Salmeterol is a new inhaled beta 2 adrenoceptor agonist, which has been shown in animal experiments to produce a more prolonged bronchodilator effect than currently available beta 2 adrenoceptor agonists. It was studied in eight adult asthmatic patients. Each patient received on separate test days salbutamol 200 micrograms and salmeterol 50, 100, and 200 micrograms according to a randomised, double blind, crossover design. FEV1, peak expiratory flow (PEF), heart rate, blood pressure, and tremor were recorded in the clinic for six hours after drug inhalation; PEF was recorded for a further six hours at home. All three doses of salmeterol produced peak increases in FEV1 (mean 0.5-0.8 l) and PEF (71-100 l/min) similar to those produced by salbutamol 200 micrograms (0.5 l and 74 l/min). After salbutamol FEV1 and PEF had returned to baseline within six hours, but after all three doses of salmeterol more than half of the maximum bronchodilator effect remained after 12 hours. The effects of salbutamol and the two lower doses of salmeterol (50 and 100 micrograms) on cardiovascular measurements and on tremor were similar, whereas after salmeterol 200 micrograms there was a small decrease in diastolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate and tremor. Thus inhaled salmeterol has a long acting bronchodilator action in asthmatic patients. This effect may be of value in the treatment of asthma, particularly in patients with nocturnal symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of high dose nebulised ipratropium was carried out in 10 asthmatic patients with documented nocturnal bronchoconstriction. Patients received nebulised saline or ipratropium 1 mg at 10 pm and 2 am on two nights. Absolute peak flow (PEF) rates were higher throughout the night after the patients had received ipratropium (at 2 am, for example, mean (SEM) PEF was 353 after ipratropium and 285 l/min after placebo). The fall in PEF overnight, however, was similar with ipratropium and placebo. Patients were given a further 1 mg nebulised ipratropium at 6 am on both nights. There was a significant overnight fall in PEF on the ipratropium night even when comparisons were made between the times that maximal cholinergic blockade would be expected, PEF falling between 11.30 pm and 7.30 am from 429 to 369 l/min. The percentage increase in PEF, though not the absolute values, was greater after ipratropium at 6 am than at 10 pm. These results confirm that ipratropium raises PEF throughout the night in asthmatic patients, but suggest that nocturnal bronchoconstriction is not due solely to an increase in airway cholinergic activity at night.\r"

After a 60-minute incubation, the plates were read automatically and then were assessed visually. Tests with seropositive samples obtained from hemophiliacs and an HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) familiarization panel showed that the automated HIV-PA test was more sensitive than the EIA and did not show a false-negative result. Of 11,300 blood donors, 44 were positive by the automated test, and 51 were positive by the EIA. None of the blood donors was confirmed to be seropositive. Using the automated test, a large number of samples could be screened in a relatively short time without a significant increase of nonspecific reactions.\r"

In order to evaluate neurohumoral changes over time, we measured plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity at baseline and sequentially during follow-up in 49 patients with chronic, stable congestive heart failure. All patients were treated with digitalis and diuretics. Converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was prescribed as adjunctive therapy in 22 patients, while 10 patients were taking hydralazine and/or isosorbide dinitrate, seven were taking prazosin, and 10 had no adjunctive therapy. Patients were divided into those taking converting enzyme inhibitors (group I, n = 22) and those not taking converting enzyme inhibitors (group II, n = 27). Group I was followed for a median (25th to 75th percentiles) of 24.3 (18 to 27.9) months, while group II was followed for 18.7 (11.9 to 36.5) months. Results indicate that patients in group I demonstrate a significant positive trend for rise in plasma norepinephrine of 11.7 pg/ml per month (7.8 to 15 pg/ml per month, 95% confidence interval). Patients in group II also demonstrated a significant positive trend in plasma norepinephrine over time of 6.6 pg/ml per month (2.2 to 11.1 pg/ml per month). Moreover, there was a progressive trend upward in plasma renin activity over time in group II (median 0.34 ng/ml/hr per month; range 0.13 to 0.54). The data indicate that there is a significant trend of neurohumoral activation over time in patients with chronic, clinically stable congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, its dose-response relationship was examined in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled five treatment parallel design protocol. Patients enrolled had heart disease with Lown grade 2 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (greater than or equal to 30/hr) documented on 24-hour Holter recordings. Propafenone was compared in four doses (337.5, 450, 675, and 900 mg/day) to placebo. The double-blind phase lasted 2 weeks. Two hundred twenty-six patients were enrolled, of whom 171 were men and 55 were women; their mean age was 59.8 years and 85% were Caucasian and 4% were black. The arrhythmias were symptomatic in 173. Twenty (8.8%) withdrew from the study before completion: 15 had adverse reactions, two had intercurrent illnesses, and three withdrew for administrative reasons. In one patient, the density of arrhythmia appeared to increase with propafenone. Side effects were of central nervous system or gastrointestinal origin; less than 5% of patients developed first-degree atrioventricular block or intraventricular conduction defect. There were no deaths in the study. The occurrence of side effects was not related to dose. Propafenone had no effect on heart rate. It increased the PR interval at all doses (9% to 22% compared to placebo at baseline; p less than 0.01) at 450 to 900 mg/day after 2 weeks of therapy. The drug increased the QRS duration at all doses, highly significantly at 675 mg/day (8.5 msec; p less than 0.01) and at 900 mg/day (15.7 msec; p less than 0.01) after 2 weeks of therapy. Only at the highest dose was the QTc slightly but significantly (14.3 msec; p less than 0.01) increased. Propafenone exerted a dose-dependent effect on PVCs recorded on serial 24-hour Holter recordings: compared to placebo, at 2 weeks 337.5 mg/day reduced PVCs by 70.8% (p less than 0.05), 450 mg/day reduced PVCs by 82.0% (p less than 0.01), 675 mg/day reduced PVCs by 90.2% (p less than 0.01) and 900 mg/day reduced PVCs by 95.3% (p less than 0.01). The effects of the two highest doses of propafenone were significantly greater than those of 337.5 mg/day. In 68% of the patients receiving 900 mg/day, 80% or greater reduction in total PVCs was found.

  ".W": "Since their introduction in clinical practice in 1980, ACE inhibitors have been found useful in the treatment of hypertension and CHF. In hypertension, they are effective as monotherapy in 40% to 50% of the patients, and in combination with diuretics or calcium antagonists, they are effective in up to 85% of the patients. They are well tolerated, are not associated with depression, impotence, bronchospasm or metabolic derangements such as hypokalemia, hyperuricemia or hyperglycemia, and do not have adverse effects on the quality of life. As a result, they are preferred in hypertensive patients with CHF, left ventricular dysfunction, mental depression, older age, coronary artery disease, metabolic disorders, chronic destructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease. In CHF they cause long-lasting hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement, improve exercise tolerance, and may lower mortality in certain patient subsets. Evolving new indications for ACE inhibitors include the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, the prediction of surgical success, the treatment of scleroderma renal crisis, the reduction of proteinuria, renal protection, cardioprotection, the improvement of arterial compliance, in Bartter's syndrome and idiopathic edema, etc. ACE inhibitors are usually well tolerated but in some instances they may cause class-specific side effects such as hypotension; usually reversible azotemia or renal failure, especially in patients with renal artery stenosis or with CHF with low blood pressure; cough; angioedema; and hyperkalemia. Differences among ACE inhibitors are emerging and include chemical class (e.g., zinc ligand), biotransformation, potency, pharmacokinetics, prodrugs, tissue effects, additional pharmacologic properties, and drug interactions.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect on morbidity and mortality of a post-myocardial infarction management and intervention system. One thousand four patients were prospectively randomized to an intervention group that included routine and emergency transtelephonic follow-up and ECG monitoring or to control; all subjects were followed for 1 year. For symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, intervention patients telephoned the project emergency office, were instructed by a project nurse to self-administer intramuscular lidocaine with an auto-injector, and were then transported to the nearest emergency facility. Cardiac death or arrest was decreased 29% in intervention patients (p = 0.066), while all-cause mortality was decreased by 24% (p less than 0.11). Routine transtelephonic ECG monitoring detected ventricular ectopy in 48% of intervention patients, with almost 50% of these findings classified as complex forms. Ventricular ectopy detected during routine calls within 60 days of the acute myocardial infarction conferred a threefold increase in mortality (p = 0.001). In addition, control patients were 2.4 times more likely to be clinically depressed (p less than 0.03) and returned to work less quickly (p less than 0.03) when compared to intervention patients. Lidocaine injections were associated with an absence of ventricular ectopy on arrival at the Emergency Room in 64% and with a low incidence of lidocaine-associated side effects. There was only one case of unauthorized use of the self-injector. These findings demonstrate that an outpatient post-myocardial infarction transtelephonic surveillance program can be safely and effectively conducted, can detect complex ventricular arrhythmias of prognostic significance, can improve the quality of life, and may reduce 1-year cardiac mortality.\r"

BP, heart rate, laboratory blood and urine tests, left ventricular wall thickness and mass index (as estimated by M-mode echocardiography) and rate and type of ventricular premature complexes (via ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring) were determined before, during and after drug treatment. Both drugs produced highly significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in supine and upright systolic and diastolic BP. The mean dosages of diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide used were 260 and 52 mg/day, respectively; at these dosages, 80% of diltiazem-treated versus 71% of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients achieved goal reduction in BP (supine diastolic BP reduction of greater than 10 mm Hg and to less than 90 mm Hg). Both drugs were well tolerated, although hydrochlorothiazide therapy was associated with multiple biochemical abnormalities not seen with diltiazem. Neither drug affected left ventricular mass index or the rate of ventricular ectopic activity. Diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide are both effective and safe agents when used as monotherapy in older patients with systemic hypertension unaccompanied by other clinically significant cardiovascular disease.\r"

Blood pressure, age and sex were matched as closely as possible. The 19 patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension and the 19 patients with primary aldosteronism were similar in age, sex and blood pressure (168 +/- 19/97 +/- 11 and 163 +/- 17/99 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively), but plasma volume was increased in the patients with primary aldosteronism. Interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass index and relative wall thickness did not differ between the 2 groups of patients. There was a significant correlation between the level of systolic blood pressure and either left ventricular mass index (r = 0.34, p less than 0.05) or relative wall thickness (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001) in both groups of patients.

When confined to the patients with systolic pressure greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg, relative wall thickness was significantly increased in the patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension. Patients with primary aldosteronism and unilateral renovascular hypertension of similar blood pressure levels, age and sex have almost identical degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy and anatomy. In contrast, the patients with primary oldosteronism had increased left ventricular dimension index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Despite immunosuppressive potency, patients treated with cyclosporin A remain at significant risk for the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. It is hypothesized that cyclosporin A's hepatotoxic effects might contribute to the atherosclerotic process by impairing low density lipoprotein hepatic clearance in transplant patients, which would be reflected in a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile. To test this hypothesis, serum cholesterol levels were analyzed after transplantation. Significant and progressive increases in total cholesterol and in the total-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were found. This atherogenic lipoprotein profile may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in cardiac transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A.\r"

In assessing the comparative efficacy of reperfusion strategies, safety factors, recanalization rates, reocclusion rates, myocardial salvage and improvement in survival must be compared. In this analysis, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) compares favorably to intravenous thrombolytic therapy or combination PTCA and thrombolytic therapy as a reperfusion strategy. Primary PTCA has not been reported to cause intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas thrombolytic strategies are associated with an incidence of a 0.2 to 1.4% rate of intracerebral bleeding. Strategies using PTCA have recanalization rates of only 33 to 75%. Disappointingly, a major failure of all reperfusion strategies (including primary PTCA) is a high rate of reocclusion and reinfarction. Primary PTCA is associated with a 7 to 16% increase in global ejection fraction. Similar improvement in ejection fraction has not been demonstrated in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy alone. Although in-hospital mortality is improved, a substantial 1-year mortality persists for intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Long-term survival is greater when PTCA therapy is used. In addition, PTCA does favorably improve survival in high-risk patients with cardiogenic shock. Although it is unlikely that most patients with acute myocardial infarction will have primary PTCA as a treatment option, this therapy remains extremely attractive for centers where primary PTCA is readily available.\r"

Acute closure and restenosis remain the 2 principal limitations of angioplasty. Means of controlling these problems, including intracoronary stenting and antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents, are now being studied. Furthermore, controlled prospective randomized trials are underway to assess the value of angioplasty compared with coronary bypass surgery in the treatment of multivessel disease. These trials will help to establish the limits of coronary angioplasty and its relative advantages in terms of therapeutic results and costs.\r"

Immunocytochemical stains were performed in 11 cases; the spindle cells stained for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin. Limited follow-up in this series does not allow for conclusions concerning differences in behavior between sarcomatoid carcinoma and conventional transitional cell carcinoma of similar grade and stage. However, the typically deep invasion of the former tumors and their histologic features indicate that they are highly aggressive neoplasms.\r"

Three calculation methods for such assessment have been described by other investigators. The three methods were compared with the use of the database of one anticoagulant clinic (Leiden Thrombosis Centre). Discrepant levels of control were obtained by these methods because of incorrect assumptions in two of them. The most accurate method is the \"cross-section-of-the-files\" approach, in which the last-recorded prothrombin time per patient is used. The authors believe it should be implemented in each anticoagulant clinic. With the use of this method, the level of therapeutic control achieved by the Leiden Thrombosis Centre for its patients on long-term treatment amounted to 80%. The same method was applied by 37 other thrombosis centers in the Netherlands using a single target range of 2.8-4.8 International Normalized Ratio for their patients. Thirty-one centers achieved a level of control of at least 70% in their long-term patients. Underanticoagulation was observed more frequently than overanticoagulation.\r"

Cells from washed deposits of midstream urine samples were transferred to gelatinized slides in a cytocentrifuge, air-dried, acetone fixed, and subjected to microwave irradiation. Slide preparations were then treated with monoclonal antibodies with the use of a four-layer peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. It was possible to identify granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and renal epithelial and urothelial cells. This method was found to be helpful in determining the profiles of cells in urine in acute tubular necrosis, drug-related acute interstitial nephritis, and crescentic glomerulonephritis.\r"

In order to clarify the clinical and pathologic features of this rare disorder, a recent case of Riedel's thyroiditis is presented, 6 additional cases from the surgical pathology files of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation are reported, and the 178 cases previously reported in the English literature are reviewed. The mean age at presentation has been 47.8 years, and 83% of patients have been female. Sixty-four percent were euthyroid, 32% hypothyroid, and 4% hyperthyroid. Antithyroid antibodies have been detected in 16 of the 25 patients tested. Since 1960, 34% of the published cases of Riedel's thyroiditis have reported the development of multifocal fibrosis. Immunohistologic study of the inflammatory infiltrate reveals a mixed population of B- and T-cells. Comparison with the infiltrate in Hashimoto's thyroiditis shows similar proportions of CD4- and CD8-positive lymphocytes. The relationship and origin of multifocal fibrosing lesions has not been defined, but an immunologic origin seems most likely. The finding of antithyroid antibodies in 67% of patients supports an autoimmune mechanism of injury.\r"

More subtle peroxisomal dysfunction is now recognized, including that deriving from single peroxisomal enzymes. Peroxisomal disorders are relatively rare. However, these disorders assume importance because of our growing ability to relate clinical sequelae to specific enzymatic and biochemical deficits, because some of these disorders can now be identified prenatally and their recurrence can be prevented, and because therapies are rapidly evolving. We reviewed these disorders in light of increasing understanding of the biochemistry of the peroxisome.\r"

We assessed the usefulness of plasma vasopressin levels as an index of plasma volume in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. However, since 80% to 90% of arginine vasopressin circulates bound to platelets, we measured vasopressin levels in platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma. The nephrotic patients (n = 19) had significantly higher vasopressin levels in platelet-poor and platelet-rich plasma compared with controls (3.2 +/- 0.6 vs 1.0 +/- 0.3 pg/mL, and 10.4 +/- 3.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.6 pg/mL. respectively). The percent binding of vasopressin to platelets was reduced in nephrotic patients compared with controls (50.2% +/- 6% vs 70.4% +/- 2.9%). The values for platelet-poor vasopressin, but not platelet-rich vasopressin, correlated significantly with the plasma renin activity (r = .83). We conclude that in nephrotic patients, platelet-poor vasopressin levels correlate with plasma renin activity and may provide a useful measure of minute-to-minute vasopressin release in response to changes in plasma volume.\r"

This report summarizes our experience with this condition from 1975 to 1985. We diagnosed, treated, and followed up this condition in 18 children and adolescents. The condition usually followed trauma. The most prominent feature in all patients was a constant limb pain with episodes of paroxysmal exacerbation. The pain was associated with two or more of the following: edema, hyperhidrosis or anhidrosis, cyanosis or erythema, and, in severe cases, dystrophic skin changes and muscle atrophy. Roentgenograms were normal. Bone scans were helpful to exclude other possible causes of bone and joint pain. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome in children probably often goes unrecognized, sometimes being confused with psychiatric conditions such as conversion reaction and malingering. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained persistent limb pain in children: early recognition and proper management may result in the prevention of potentially crippling sequelae.\r"

The ability to biopsy under direct vision, reliably obtain a pancreatogram, exclude other upper gastrointestinal disorders, and reexamine with ease, combined with the lack of hepatic puncture, has given the endoscopic route an undeniable advantage over the percutaneous transhepatic route for these interventions. Although some have become routine procedures (EST for postcholecystectomy choledocholithiasis; transpapillary stent insertion for inoperable biliary stenoses), the exact place of many of these interventions remains unclear, and the subject of prospective controlled studies where possible. This review attempts to give an overview of present and developing ERCP- and EST-based diagnostic and interventive techniques and their application to the wide spectrum of pancreatobiliary diseases.\r"

It is concluded that the significance of dietary factors in cancer prevention, is exaggerated. Even if an association does exist between nutritional practices and the risk for certain cancers, it is very small.

Highly elevated serum AFP levels (greater than 200 ng/ml) relatively specific for HCC were seen also in three patients. However, nonspecific elevation of PIVKA-II in patients with liver cirrhosis not accompanied by HCC was much less than that of AFP. Although complementary, both tests appear to be of limited value in early detection of HCC, indicating that searches for other markers are necessary, to allow early detection of small HCC.\r"

  ".W": "The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by increased urinary excretion of albumin and other serum proteins, accompanied by hypoproteinemia and edema formation. Nephrotic patients have lower serum albumin concentrations than do patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis when albumin and protein losses are the same in both groups, suggesting that nephrotic patients may not maximally adapt to loss of protein. The fractional rate of albumin catabolism is increased in nephrotic patients, possibly as a result of increased albumin catabolism by the kidney, but the absolute albumin catabolic rate is decreased in nephrotic patients. The rate of albumin synthesis may be increased, but not sufficiently to maintain normal serum albumin concentration or albumin pools. Augmentation of dietary protein in nephrotic rats directly stimulates albumin synthesis by increasing albumin mRNA content in the liver, but also causes an increase in glomerular permeability to macromolecules so that much if not all of the excess albumin synthesized is lost in the urine. When dietary protein is restricted, the rate of albumin synthesis is not increased either in nephrotic patients or in rats, despite severe hypoalbuminemia. Although dietary protein supplementation may lead to positive nitrogen balance, dietary protein supplementation alone does not cause an increase in serum albumin concentration or body albumin pools, and may instead cause further albumin pool depletion because of changes induced in glomerular permselectivity. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may blunt the increased albuminuria caused by dietary protein supplementation and allow albumin stores to be increased.\r"

Because of the enormous impact kidney transplantation can have for patients, the authors have performed 40 living-unrelated donor renal transplantations using a donor-specific transfusion protocol since 1981. Ten additional patients were entered but became sensitized. Donors included 23 wives, seven husbands, six friends, and four individuals related by marriage. Type I diabetes was the most common indication for transplantation (45%). Despite 36 rejections in 24 patients (27 of 36 [75%] in the early postoperative period), only two grafts failed because of rejection. Twenty-one of these rejections responded to high-dose prednisone alone; the remainder required antilymphocyte globulin therapy or plasmapheresis. Sixteen patients had no acute rejections. Three other grafts were lost, including two deaths: one myocardial infarction (with a functioning graft), and one death secondary to a postoperative cecal perforation. One graft was lost from infarction after percutaneous nephrostomy placement. Of 40 grafts, 34 were functioning with a mean serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL (at a mean follow-up time of 27 months). Actuarial patient and graft survival were 94% and 89%, respectively, at 3 years. Living-unrelated renal transplants are an acceptable alternative to cadaver transplants, with excellent graft and patient survival.\r"

The outcome in 53 older patients (mean age, 54 years; range, 50 to 64 years) receiving transplants between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1986 and followed through June 30, 1987 were analyzed. Before 1984, immunosuppression consisted of azathioprine and prednisone (AP); thereafter, triple therapy (TT)--low-dose cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone--was used. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial patient survival was 87%, 84%, and 84%, respectively. Survival for living related donor (LRD) transplant recipients was 100%, 92%, and 92%; survival for cadaveric (CAD) transplant recipients was 81%, 81%, and 81%. The overall graft survival was 74%, 66%, and 66% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively; graft survival was 88%, 81%, and 81% for LRD transplant recipients and 68%, 58%, and 58%, for CAD recipients. The patient and graft survival rates were better in the TT group than in the AP group. Eight patients died after transplantation; six within the first year. The causes of patient death were infection (50%), cardiac (25%), and malignancy (25%). Rejection (56%) and patient death (38%) accounted for most of the grafts lost. Patient and graft survival rates in diabetic patients were not significantly different from survival rates in nondiabetic patients. Results in recipients of ten secondary and one tertiary transplant were poor, with only four of 11 grafts functioning at 1 year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The inclusion of type of donor and main immunosuppressive drug as covariates in the model did not violate the proportionality assumption of the Cox model. According to this method, the following covariates were significant in predicting graft survival: cyclosporine, type of donor, good human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and HLA-B match (DR data were not considered), highest percentage of reactive antibodies against panel cells, and nephroangiosclerosis as a primary renal disease. Cyclosporine did not significantly improve graft survival in living related donor transplants. Pretransplant blood transfusions, cold ischemia time, and donor ABO blood group were initially significant but dropped out in the step-down procedure. Recipient's age at transplant, cyclosporine, HLA-A and HLA-B match, and nephroangiosclerosis were significant in predicting patient survival. It was concluded that using long-term data of cadaveric and living related renal transplants either on azathioprine or cyclosporine is a valid way to perform multivariate analysis of single-center transplant programs that do not have large samples.\r"

  ".W": "From 11 studies, a total of 1,792 Caucasian probands with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are analyzed. Antigen genotype frequencies in patients, transmission from affected parents to affected children, and the relative frequencies of HLA-DR3 and -DR4 homozygous patients all indicate that DR3 predisposes in a \"recessive\"-like and DR4 in a \"dominant\"-like or \"intermediate\" fashion, after allowing for the DR3/DR4 synergistic effect. Removal of DR3 and DR4 reveals an overall protective effect of DR2, predisposing effects of DR1 and DRw8, and a slight protective effect of DR5 and a predisposing effect of DRw6. Analysis of affected-parent-to-affected-child data indicates that a subset of DR2 may predispose. The non-DR3, non-DR4 antigens are not independently associated with DR3 and DR4; the largest effect is a deficiency of DR2, followed by excesses of DR1, DRw8, and DRw6, in DR4 individuals, as compared with DR3 individuals. HLA-B locus distributions on patient haplotypes indicate that only subsets of both DR3 and DR4 are predisposing. The presence or absence of Asp at position 57 of the DQ beta gene, recently implicated in IDDM predisposition, is not by itself sufficient to explain the inheritance of IDDM. At a minimum, the distinguishing features of the DR3-associated and DR4-associated predisposition remain to be identified at the molecular level. Risk estimates for sibs of probands are calculated based on an overall sibling risk of 6%; estimates for those sharing two, one, or zero haplotypes are 12.9%, 4.5%, and 1.8%, respectively. Risk estimates subdivided by the DR type of the proband are also calculated, the highest being 19.2% for sibs sharing two haplotypes with a DR3/DR4 proband.\r"

The clinical features were typical, and radiographs revealed short ribs, hypoplastic ilia, absence of ossification of sacrum, pubis, ischia, tali, calcanei, and many vertebral bodies; the long bones were short with mild metaphyseal flaring. The femoral cylinder index was 6.3. Comparison with previous cases placed the patient toward the mild end of the achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis spectrum (Whitley-Gorlin prototype IV). Light microscopy revealed hypercellular cartilage with decreased matrix traversed by numerous fibrous vascular canals. The growth plate was markedly abnormal. Ultrastructural studies revealed prominently dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum containing a fine granular material with occasional fibrils in all chondrocytes. Immunohistologic studies indicated irregular large areas of cartilage matrix staining with monoclonal antibody to human type III collagen. The relative intensity of matrix staining for type II collagen appeared diminished. More striking, however, were intense focal accumulations of type II collagen within small rounded perinuclear structures of most chondrocytes but not other cell types. These results strongly suggest intracellular retention of type II collagen within vacuolar structures, probably within the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum observed in all chondrocytes by electron microscopy (EM), and imply the presence of an abnormal, poorly secreted type II collagen molecule. Biochemical studies (see companion paper) suggest that this patient had a new dominant lethal disorder caused by a structural abnormality of type II collagen.\r"

Unlike macroangiopathy, which can readily be prevented by means that are currently on hand, the origin and treatment of microangiopathy remain far more problematical. The complexity of this lesion is indicated by the findings in this laboratory that hyperglycemia induced by the rodenticide, vacor, can cause microangiopathy independent of genetic diabetes, yet significant microangiopathic lesions can be detected in genetic diabetic patients before the appearance of hyperglycemia. Further, there is now intriguing evidence based both on basement membrane measurements from our laboratory and on clinical studies showing that significant microangiopathy only rarely occurs prior to the onset of puberty. The evidence that control or even normalization of blood glucose levels does not influence the course of established microangiopathy is becoming increasingly convincing. Five prospective, randomized studies over the past five years have shown that strict regulation of glucose has no consistent benefit on, and in some studies may, at least transiently, accelerate, the retinopathy of diabetes. Moreover, the first controlled study of successful pancreatic transplantation to achieve normalization of blood glucose levels has again demonstrated that established retinopathy is neither prevented nor even delayed by normal glucose levels. This review, therefore, emphasizes that, though hyperglycemia is required for clinically significant microangiopathy to occur, clearly other factors, genetic, environmental, or both, must play major roles in determining the course of microangiopathy. It is toward these nonglycemic factors in the development of diabetic microangiopathy that future research should increasingly be directed.\r"

Three cardiovascular testing methods, RR-variation, Valsalva maneuver, and postural testing, were selected because each is a simple, non-invasive, quantitative, sensitive, and reproducible test. Furthermore, a hierarchy of sensitivity has been established with these cardiovascular autonomic nervous system measurements: RR-variation, Valsalva maneuver, and finally postural testing. Confounding variables were minimized by prescribing eligibility criteria. Testing equipment, designed to record time between RR intervals in a form easily read into a computer, has been in 21 clinics for three years and a total of 54 technicians have been trained. Over 85 percent of the autonomic nervous system tests performed have been usable at initial testing. A central reading center is an efficient and necessary means of collecting and analyzing data for a multicenter clinical trial.\r"

In our review of 301 veterans presenting to a sexual dysfunction clinic, the clinical and hormonal alterations in the diabetic patients closely resemble those seen in nondiabetic impotent subjects. Atherosclerotic vascular changes play an important predisposing role in the development of impotence. A difference exists between the prevalences of associated medical conditions in diabetic patients taking insulin, compared with those receiving oral agents or receiving dietary management. The high prevalence of impotence in diabetic patients seems to be due to the high prevalence of its vascular complications. Considering the availability of useful therapeutic approaches, it is mandatory to evaluate all diabetic men for the presence of impotence.\r"

Total cholesterol intake should be less than 300 mg per day. Fiber appears to have distinct benefits in improving glucose and lipid levels; therefore, an intake of up to 40 g per day or 15 to 25 g/1,000 kcal of food is recommended. Other considerations in meal planning for diabetes include alternative sweeteners, salt intake, alcohol consumption, and vitamin and mineral needs. Individualized and flexible nutrition plans, designed within established guidelines, promote adherence. Persons with diabetes can change their eating patterns and closely adhere to a diet plan if the entire health care team is enthusiastic, supportive, and instructive.\r"

Those patients with long-standing disease or elevations of fasting plasma glucose in excess of 140 mg/dl are generally hypoinsulinemic in response to an oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetic patients who do not have an acute response to intravenous glucose may have normal responses to intravenous tolbutamide or intravenous arginine, suggesting that delayed responsiveness to glucose is not due to decreased pancreatic insulin content. An association between hyperinsulinemia and hypertension has been suggested by recent studies from several laboratories. In a homogeneous population of men who suffered traumatic bilateral above-the-knee amputation in the Vietnam War with subsequent development of obesity, it was shown that there was strong correlation between hypertension and hyperinsulinemia during oral glucose tolerance testing despite only mild glucose intolerance. In addition, a subset of hypertensive women who were in their third trimester of pregnancy were markedly hyperinsulinemic during oral glucose tolerance testing in the absence of any abnormalities of glucose tolerance. Thus, the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and hypertension, and the possible reasons for this relationship, are fields of active investigation at present.\r"

The latter was tested in in vitro rat pancreases by anterograde and retrograde perfusion with or without anti-insulin or antisomatostatin antibody. Anterograde infusion of insulin antibody increased glucagon and somatostatin secretion (p less than 0.0005), whereas retrograde insulin antibody infusion was without effect. Anterograde infusion of somatostatin antibody had no effect upon insulin or glucagon secretion. In contrast, retrograde infusion of somatostatin antibody increased both insulin and glucagon secretion (p less than 0.0005). In comparison, anterograde infusion of antiglucagon antibody decreased somatostatin secretion without influencing insulin, whereas retrograde antiglucagon antibody infusion decreased insulin without changing somatostatin secretion. These results establish a \"directed\" functional microvascular circulation with a strict sequence of perfusion, first of B cells, then A cells, then D cells. The B cell microvascularly is the primary glucose sensor and its insulin plays a vital role in inhibiting glucagon secretion. The abnormalities in glucagon secretion in diabetes mellitus can now be explained by a deficiency in intra-islet microvascular insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin is known to control a number of anabolic metabolic processes in a variety of target tissues through activation of cell surface receptors. It is clear that insulin receptor activation provokes increases in tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, but subsequent events have not been elucidated. Recently, it has become clear that insulin provokes the following rapid changes in phospholipid metabolism, which result in the generation of several intercellular signaling substances (or mediators): (1) hydrolysis of a phosphatidylinositol-glycan; (2) stimulation of de novo synthesis of phosphatidic acid; and (3) hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by a phospholipase C and/or D. Hydrolysis of the phosphatidylinositol-glycan leads to the release of polar headgroups, which serve as mediators to activate phosphatases, and may thereby account for a number of insulin effects on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and regulation of cyclic nucleotide metabolism. All three phospholipid effects of insulin also generate diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and this may contribute to insulin effects on glucose transport, ion and amino acid transport, protein synthesis, and gene expression (messenger RNA synthesis). Combined, the headgroup mediators and diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signaling systems may account for many, or perhaps most, of insulin's actions. Moreover, the three phospholipid effects of insulin appear to be coordinated, and may function as an integrated cycle to ensure the continued synthesis of lipids, which are the sources of the signaling substances during insulin action.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is characterized by fasting hyperglycemia associated with defects in the pancreatic islet, the liver, and the peripheral tissues, which together comprise a feedback loop responsible for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. This review focuses on the key role of the endocrine pancreas A and B cells to coordinate glucose output from the liver with glucose utilization. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production is elevated in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and this is positively correlated with the degree of fasting hyperglycemia. This increased rate of glucose release by the liver results from impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin and reduced insulin secretion. Though basal insulin levels in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may appear normal when compared with those of healthy persons, islet function testing at matched glucose levels reveals impairments of basal and stimulated insulin secretion due to a reduction in B cell secretory capacity. The degree of impaired beta-cell responsiveness to glucose is closely related to the degree of fasting hyperglycemia but in a curvilinear fashion. The efficiency of glucose uptake by the peripheral tissues is also impaired due to a combination of decreased insulin secretion and defective cellular insulin action. This impairment becomes more important to the hyperglycemia as the islet dysfunction declines. Therapeutic interventions either improve islet dysfunction and raise plasma insulin levels, reduce hepatic glucose production, or improve the efficiency of tissue glucose uptake. All result in a decline in the fasting glucose level regardless of the cause of hyperglycemia. It is concluded that non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is characterized by a steady-state re-regulation of plasma glucose concentration at an elevated level in which islet dysfunction plays a necessary role.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) constitute an important element of signal transduction in various cells. These changes either reflect alterations in calcium (Ca2+) fluxes or result from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In pancreatic islet cells, an increase in [Ca2+]i is critical for secretagogue-induced insulin release. Thus, glucose evokes a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, primarily by stimulating Ca2+ influx. Under physiologic conditions, glucose may also promote mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores by virtue of stimulating membrane phospholipid hydrolysis and formation of inositol triphosphate, a potent stimulus for Ca2+ mobilization. This action of glucose requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The magnitude of change in [Ca2+]i may not parallel the level of insulin release, suggesting that the role of [Ca2+]i in the process of insulin release must be considered in concert with other cellular mechanisms. The role of [Ca2+]i in promoting insulin action is a subject of continuous controversy. Recent observations that chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with quin-2 diminishes insulin action (and that of insulin mimetics) support the role of Ca2+ in mediating the insulin-generated signal. Insulin has also been demonstrated to increase [Ca2+]i in adipocytes in close association with its effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Finally, in both pancreatic islet cells and adipocytes, high concentrations of either extracellular or intracellular Ca2+ inhibit cellular responsiveness. The optimal concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ appear to be within the 140 to 350 nM range. When Ca2+ concentrations are too low or too high, the ability of pancreatic islets and insulin target cells to respond appropriately to physiologic stimuli is significantly diminished. Impaired cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (either primary or secondary to other cellular lesions) may represent a crucial and identical link in the pathogenesis of impaired insulin secretion and in the pathogenesis of impaired insulin action.\r"

The vascular endothelium is continuously and directly bathed by components of the bloodstream and represents the initial fixed anatomical surface with which these components come in contact. In the past decade, the methodologies for studying endothelial cell functions have markedly advanced, enabling direct and detailed study of the vascular endothelium. From such studies, it is now apparent that the vascular endothelium represents an extraordinarily complex network of cells demonstrating a multitude of distinct anatomic, metabolic, and immunologic properties critical to such processes as angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, neoplasia, and a variety of metabolic disorders including homocystinuria and diabetes mellitus. This report will focus on the interactions of insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) with vascular endothelium, based on studies with cultured endothelial cells, isolated microvessels, and perfused organ systems. Data will be presented relevant to the following concepts: (1) endothelial cells, in culture and in vivo, have specific receptors for insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II; (2) insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II have both distinct and overlapping functions in cultured endothelial cells; (3) cultured endothelial cells process receptor-bound insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II, by distinct processes; (4) in vivo, capillary endothelial receptors are integrally involved in the transport of intact insulin to subendothelial sites of insulin action; and (5) vascular endothelium has specialized cellular features that are likely to contribute to the unique interactions of endothelial cells with insulin and the IGFs.\r"

The initial step in insulin degradation by the liver is binding to a cell membrane receptor, following which some insulin is degraded and the products released into the incubation medium, whereas some insulin is internalized and degraded intracellularly. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the degradation of insulin by hepatocytes produces products identical to those generated by the enzyme insulin protease. With both enzyme and intact hepatocytes, two A-chain cleavages and four major and three minor B-chain cleavages occur in intact insulin. It has also been demonstrated that internalized insulin is degraded in early endosomes, primarily by cleavages in the B chain and occurring prior to acidification of the endosome and thus prior to dissociation of insulin from its receptor. The initial cleavages in the B chain of insulin occur in the same sites as are cleaved by insulin protease, supporting a role for this enzyme, both in the extracellular and intracellular metabolism of insulin. These findings also indicate that lysosomes probably play a minor or secondary role for hepatic insulin metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have led to an enhanced understanding of cellular alterations that may play an important role in the pathophysiology of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The insulin receptor links insulin binding at the cell surface to intracellular activation of insulin's effects. This transducer function involves the tyrosine kinase property of the beta-subunit of the receptor. It was found that adipocytes from subjects with NIDDM had a 50 to 80 percent reduction in insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity compared with their non-diabetic counterparts. This defect was relatively specific for the diabetic state since no decrease was observed in insulin-resistant non-diabetic obese subjects. The reduction in kinase activity was accounted for by changes in the ratio of two pools of receptors, both of which bind insulin but only one of which is capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation and subsequent kinase activation; 43 percent of the receptors from non-diabetic subjects were capable of autophosphorylation compared with only 14 percent in the NIDDM group. A major component of cellular insulin resistance in NIDDM involves the glucose transport system. Exposure of cells to insulin normally results in enhanced glucose transport mediated by translocation of glucose transporters from a low-density microsomal intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. It was found that cells from NIDDM subjects had a marked depletion of glucose transporters in both plasma membranes and low-density microsomes, relative to obese non-diabetic control participants. Obese non-diabetic persons had a normal number of plasma membrane transporters but a reduced number of low-density microsome transporters in the basal state compared with lean control volunteers; insulin induced the translocation of relatively fewer transporters from the low-density microsome to the plasma membrane in the obese subgroups. In addition to the diminished number of glucose transporters, cells from both NIDDM and obese subjects had impaired functional activity of glucose carriers since decreased whole-cell glucose transport rates could not be entirely explained by the magnitude of the decrement in the number of plasma membrane transporters. Thus, impaired glucose transport is due to both a numerical and functional defect in glucose transporters. The cellular content of high-density microsomal transporters was the same in lean and obese control volunteers and NIDDM subjects, suggesting that transporter synthesis is normal and that cellular depletion results from increased protein turnover once transporters leave the high-density microsomal subfraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89060315\r", 
  ".W": "One or more phospholipases of the C and A2 types exist in rodent islets and may play a pivotal role in the cell signaling cascade culminating in exocytotic insulin release. Phospholipase C generates myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mobilizes a \"pool\" of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum and which may also secondarily facilitate calcium (Ca++) influx from the extracellular space to replenish that pool. Diacylglycerol is also generated by phospholipase C action and activates protein kinase C; it may thereby potentiate the cellular response to elevations in cytosolic free Ca++ concentration. Arachidonic acid may be released during the degradation of diacylglycerol and may also contribute to islet activation. Phospholipase C is activated by glucose, cholinergic agonists, and probably by Ca++ fluxes. Phospholipase A2 action generates arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. Certain lysophospholipids mobilize cellular Ca++, at least in part from superficial, plasmalemmal stores. Native (unoxygenated) arachidonic acid also has the capability of mobilizing cellular Ca++ from membrane-bound stores; it may, in addition, activate protein kinase C, as suggested by recent indirect studies. The further metabolism of arachidonic acid via lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase appears to provide positive and negative modulation, respectively, of stimulated insulin secretion. Many pieces of the puzzle remain, however, to be supplied. For example, it has not yet been unequivocally demonstrated that phospholipase A2 is activated by physiologic stimuli in intact islets. Furthermore, the absence of truly specific pharmacologic stimulators or inhibitors of these processes currently precludes precise delineation of the respective physiologic roles of each potential mediator in stimulus-secretion coupling. When such roles are elucidated, it can be asked whether the defects in insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus may be due in part to abnormalities in the turnover of beta-cell membrane phospholipids and the generation of intracellular lipid-derived signals.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: There is a high incidence of sleep apnea in patients with untreated hypothyroidism. Thyroxine treatment is said to significantly reduce the apnea index and length and sleep apnea symptoms. We undertook a review of 10 consecutive hypothyroid patients with sleep apnea to investigate mechanisms and management of these two disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polysomnograms were obtained in 10 consecutive hypothyroid patients referred to our sleep disorders unit. All patients were studied while hypothyroid. Eight patients were restudied later when euthyroid. Lung function, blood gas values, and awake supraglottic resistance were also assessed in each patient. RESULTS: All 10 patients had sleep apnea and were treated with thyroxine. In one patient, hypothyroid myopathy involving the upper airway was demonstrated to be a potential mechanism of sleep apnea in hypothyroidism. Nocturnal angina and ventricular arrhythmias developed in two patients, despite the use of low thyroxine doses. Nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) was begun in eight patients. Initiation of CPAP prevented further angina or arrythmia in the patients with these cardiac complications. Six of the eight patients who were available for follow-up studies had persistent sleep apnea despite an euthyroid status (apnea index before thyroxine, 51 +/- 6; apnea index after thyroxine, 45 +/- 8), and CPAP therapy was continued in these patients. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that the apnea index does not decrease significantly in all patients with hypothyroidism and sleep apnea when euthyroidism is achieved. Treatment of hypothyroidism in the presence of sleep apnea is potentially hazardous and may lead to cardiovascular complications. Management by a combination of CPAP and low-dose thyroxine is helpful in this situation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence of a central role for the calcium ion in blood pressure regulation. By studying blood pressure control in disorders of calcium homeostasis, a better understanding of the role of the calcium ion and certain calcitrophic hormones in modulating arterial pressure in humans may be gained. Our goal was to examine levels of blood pressure in a group of patients with either type Ia or type Ib pseudohypoparathyroidism (PsHP), a disorder characterized by target organ resistance to parathyroid hormone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with type I PsHP were recruited for the study (28 with type Ia and 18 with type Ib). Blood pressure was measured and the degree of obesity was assessed in all patients. Detailed measurements of hormones involved in blood pressure regulation were made in nine hypertensive patients with PsHP. RESULTS: Elevated arterial pressure was present in 18 of the 46 patients with PsHP, which comprised 53 percent (18 of 34) of the adult subjects. Prevalence of hypertension was similar in PsHP type Ia (nine of 21) and type Ib (nine of 13; p not significant) and was not related to coexisting hypothyroidism or degree of hypocalcemia. However, hypertension in PsHP was strongly linked to severe obesity. Mean body weights of normotensive and hypertensive patients with PsHP were 64 +/- 2.8 (SEM) kg (125 +/- 6 percent ideal body weight) and 96 +/- 4.7 kg (172 +/- 10 percent ideal body weight), respectively. Compared with obese hypertensive non-PsHP persons, hypertensive subjects with PsHP had reduced basal and posture-stimulated renin activity (basal, 1.68 +/- 0.36 [n = 9] versus 3.97 +/- 0.61 ng/ml/hour [n = 9] [p less than 0.05]; upright posture, 2.11 +/- 0.42 versus 7.13 ng/ml/hour [p less than 0.05]; and lower basal and posture-stimulated plasma norepinephrine levels (basal, 236 +/- 52 versus 426 +/- 37 pg/ml [p less than 0.05]; upright posture, 424 +/- 62 versus 707 +/- 64 pg/ml [p less than 0.05]). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that hypertension is common in PsHP types Ia and Ib. This newly identified form of endocrine hypertension is strongly linked to excessive body weight but is associated with alterations in the renin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems that are distinct from those encountered in obesity-related hypertension in the general population. The pathophysiologic basis for hypertension in these two distinctly different forms of PsHP remains to be determined.\r"

We therefore conducted two randomized, controlled clinical trials to test the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins in patients with cholera diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In Trial I, 45 patients with cholera were randomly assigned to receive two doses (2 g in 100 ml of water each) of anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins, non-immune bovine colostral immunoglobulins, or 100 ml of water alone. In Trial II, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g of anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins or non-immune bovine colostral immunoglobulins or water every two hours for a total of eight doses. The mean stool volumes in each of two sequential eight-hour periods following initiation of therapy were not significantly different among study groups in either trial. RESULTS: Measurement of immunoglobulin in stools showed that bovine IgG was detected in 19 of 25 patients given bovine colostral immunoglobulins in both trials. Cholera toxin neutralizing activity, as assessed with the rabbit ileal loop assay, was found in the stools of three of seven patients given anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins in Trail I, and in all six patients given anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins in Trail II. CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral anti-cholera toxin bovine colostral immunoglobulins are not effective in the treatment of patients with active cholera diarrhea. The prophylactic benefit of oral antitoxin antibody remains to be determined.\r"

For this group of patients, intensive therapy and bone marrow rescue may be curative. Our goal was to assess the effects of autologous transplantation in patients with B-cell lymphomas and a poor prognosis. To avoid occult or overt contamination with lymphoma, monoclonal antibodies BA-1, BA-2, and BA-3 were used for ex vivo marrow treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients underwent intensive therapy and autologous bone marrow transplant using the aforementioned marrow. Ten of the 17 patients (Group I) had disease that was in complete or partial remission. The other seven patients either had disease that was not responsive to treatment or had bone marrow transplant as their initial therapy at relapse. RESULTS: The ex vivo treatment did not adversely affect engraftment. For those patients who could be evaluated, the median time to white cell engraftment was 24 days; the median durations of red cell and platelet support were 24 and 29 days, respectively. Eleven of the 17 patients had complete remissions at the evaluation 28 days after transplant. Three patients subsequently experienced a relapse, three died while their disease was in complete remission, and five are alive and disease-free 405 to 1,674 days after transplant. Group I patients had an estimated 40 percent disease-free survival rate at three years compared with 0 percent for Group II patients (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our data support autologous bone marrow transplantation as an important treatment modality for the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. With the current preparative regimens available, however, its use should be limited to patients with disease that is still responding to conventional therapies.\r"

Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration mediated by activation of cell surface receptors result in the formation of a Ca2+ calmodulin complex that regulates many Ca2+-dependent cellular processes. In smooth muscle, Ca2+/calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase, which phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin. This phosphorylation reaction increases the actin-activated MgATPase activity of myosin and is associated with increases in contractile properties, including force, stiffness, and maximal shortening velocity. These biochemical and biomechanical responses occur rapidly (seconds) in response to physiological stimulation involving neurotransmitter activation of smooth muscle cells. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chain is a primary event in activation of smooth muscle contraction.\r"

Sera were absorbed with nu/+BALB/c mouse serum proteins coupled to Sepharose 4B to remove nonspecific binding. All sera were coded and tested against at least 2 of 4 lymph nodes from nu/nu mice that were previously inoculated with either CD tissue filtrate or with a passaged CD-induced nu/nu lymphoma. Reference positive CD sera and negative control sera were run in parallel during each assay. Sera from three CD patients consistently showed positive IF. None of the sera from patients with infectious diarrhea, other disease controls, or normals were positive.

They produce sustained beneficial hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in most patients with congestive heart failure and may produce greater symptomatic benefit than digoxin when given as second-line therapy to patients with heart failure on diuretics. Their neurohumoral effects generally are advantageous, resulting in normalization of sodium and potassium balance and a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias. The ACE inhibitors may improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure, and recent data suggest that they may prevent or delay the development of left ventricular dilatation and overt heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The different classes of mutations that are responsible for the thalassemia syndromes will be discussed along with the special insights they have provided into the controls of eukaryotic gene expression. While management of these disorders has not kept pace with our understanding of their cause, there have been notable advances in treatment. Perhaps even more exciting is what the future holds, as the continued march of molecular biology is melded with novel approaches to the definitive treatment of thalassemias.\r"

Nine months after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, he developed neoplastic meningitis with eosinophilic pleocytosis and neurologic findings suggestive of peri-fourth ventricle infiltration. Morphologic and surface marker analysis of cerebrospinal fluid cells showed large numbers of T-lymphocytes and Reed-Sternberg variant cells positive for CD15, the Lex hapten expressed on myeloid cells and on a variety of malignant cells. Therapy with intrathecal methotrexate, oral dexamethasone, and cranial irradiation resulted in prompt resolution of his cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities and neurologic deficits. Ten months after the diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis, systemic relapse of Hodgkin's disease occurred in right iliac and inguinal lymph nodes. The diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of this unusual complication of Hodgkin's disease are reviewed.\r"

The factors predisposing to nodule formation and to a nodule being malignant are reviewed with emphasis that prior radiation exposure does not appear to increase the likelihood that a given nodule harbors a malignancy. In considering the laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules, the limitations of isotope scans and ultrasonography are noted. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is described as revolutionizing the management of thyroid nodules and decreasing unnecessary operations. In the context of the natural history of differentiated thyroid cancer, the application of a decision analysis model to management options is described in some detail, and a cost-effective management regimen is recommended with fine needle aspiration biopsy as the initial procedure.\r"

Marking of the disk margin was performed in a random and masked fashion on each image three times by three independent observers. The overall variabilities of the measurements of the subjects with glaucoma were not statistically different from those of the normal subjects. Overall variability was about 0.2 mm2 for total disk area, 0.08 for cup/disk ratio, 0.2 mm2 for disk rim area, and 0.07 mm3 for cup volume. The largest component of the variability was the result of acquisition of separate images of the optic disk at different times. Observer inconsistency in marking the disk edge was relatively small. Based on the expected amount of random variability of the measurements, we proposed criteria for detecting significant change in the optic disk over time.\r"

The liability for abuse may also be greater for alcoholics, but the substantial methodologic deficiencies of existing studies preclude such a conclusion. Given the frequency of anxiety disorders and benzodiazepine use among alcoholics, their potential for benzodiazepine abuse is an important issue. The authors discuss clinical guidelines and strategies for future research.\r"

In the laboratory, psychological stimuli have also been shown to affect uterine activity. Clinical studies suggest that interventions which reduce tension and anxiety can prevent or inhibit preterm labor. A model is proposed that links preterm labor to a disorder of arousal manifested physiologically as a hyperreactivity of the limbic circuitry and its efferent components. Autonomic hyperreactivity has been found repeatedly in women who experience preterm labor. This central hyperreactivity could unleash a cascade of psychophysiological reactions that could cause uterine excitation and facilitate preterm labor.\r"

Of 18 patients who completed the study, 16 had substantial recurrence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms by the end of the 7-week placebo period. In addition, 11 had a significant increase in depressive symptoms. Treatment duration before discontinuation of clomipramine was not related to the frequency or severity of obsessive-compulsive or depressive symptom appearance.

The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetic recipients of cadaveric kidneys (0.419) was not significantly different from that in diabetic recipients of pancreas transplants (0.40), but significantly higher than that in diabetics given kidneys from living donors (0.187). Although cadaveric recipients were older than recipients of kidneys from living donors (40.8 v. 31.6 years), age at the time of transplantation was not a significant predictor of difficulty in laryngoscopy. Groups were otherwise matched for clinical, morphologic, hematologic, and biochemical indices. Diabetic stiff joint syndrome (SJS), which predisposes a subset of Type I diabetic patients to rapidly progressive microvascular disease and subsequent need for renal and/or pancreas transplantation, may lead to difficult laryngoscopy because of involvement of the atlanto-occipital joint.\r"

  ".U": "89060568\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of 4(5)-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]imidazole (medetomidine), the alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, on anesthetic requirements was investigated in rats anesthetized with halothane. Halothane MAC was determined before and after either dexmedetomidine (d-enantiomer) or levomedetomidine (l-enantiomer) 10, 30, and 100 micrograms/kg or vehicle ip. There was a dose-dependent decrease in MAC with the d-, but not the l-, stereoisomer. At the highest dose of dexmedetomidine (100 micrograms/kg), halothane could be discontinued for up to 30 min with no response to tail clamping. To determine whether alpha 2 adrenoreceptors mediated this effect of dexmedetomidine on MAC, cohorts of rats were pretreated with idazoxan, 10 mg/kg ip, a highly selective alpha 2 antagonist. This completely prevented the reduction of MAC caused by dexmedetomidine. To determine whether the reduction of MAC caused by dexmedetomidine was mediated in part through either opiate or adenosine receptors, groups of rats were pretreated with either naltrexone, 5 mg/kg ip, an opiate antagonist, or 8-phenyltheophylline, 2.5 mg/kg ip, an A1 adenosine antagonist. These two pretreatments did not alter the reduction of MAC by dexmedetomidine. To determine whether postsynaptic mechanisms mediate the anesthetic effect of dexmedetomidine, rats were depleted of central catecholamine stores with either n-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) or reserpine and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine and MAC was determined before and after each dose of dexmedetomidine. While the catecholamine-depleted rats had a lower basal MAC than the vehicle controls, there was still a profound reduction in halothane MAC after administration of dexmedetomidine. The reduction of MAC by dexmedetomidine was blocked with idazoxan in the catecholamine depleted rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with acute respiratory failure underwent lung computed tomography (CT) and physiological measurements at 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to investigate the relationship between morphology and function. Lung densities were primarily concentrated in the dependent regions. From the frequency distribution of CT numbers (difference in x-ray attenuation between water and lung) and lung gas volume measurements the authors obtained a quantitative estimate of normally inflated, poorly inflated, and non-inflated lung tissue weight. This estimated average lung weight was increased twofold above normal and excess lung weight correlated with the mean pulmonary artery pressure (P less than 0.01). Venous admixture correlated with the non-inflated tissue mass (P less than 0.01). Increasing PEEP caused progressive clearing of radiographic densities and increased the mass of normally inflated tissue (anatomic recruitment), while reducing venous admixture. The cardiac index decreased after increasing PEEP while oxygen delivery was unchanged. The authors conclude that CT scan lung density and oxygen exchange efficiency are correlated; the main effect of augmenting PEEP is to recruit perfused alveolar units that were previously collapsed.\r"

The authors determined whether a specific regimen of preoperative oral dantrolene would result in protective blood levels at induction of anesthesia, and in the postoperative period. Ten malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) patients were given a total dose of 5 mg.kg-1 of oral dantrolene in three or four divided doses, every 6 h, with the last dose 4 h preoperatively. Plasma dantrolene levels were determined by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography at induction of anesthesia and every 6 h thereafter for 48 h. All ten patients had plasma dantrolene levels over 2.8 micrograms.ml-1 at induction of anesthesia, for at least 6 h and, in three patients, up to 18 h after induction. Every patient had an uneventful perioperative course. Side effects (drowsiness, weakness) occurred in seven patients. An elimination half-life of 15.8 +/- 6.0 h was determined. In contrast to intravenous dantrolene, this specific oral dantrolene regimen resulted in protective plasma levels for 6-18 h after induction of anesthesia. These results were likely due to the relatively high bioavailability of oral dantrolene and, possibly, to continued absorption of dantrolene in the postoperative period.\r"

Although the initial local events of inflammation occur normally in any viable tissue, the subsequent reparative capacities of macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells are seriously impaired by any compromise of local perfusion and oxygenation. In particular, the bacteriocidal capacities of granulocytes are heavily dependent on local oxygenation/perfusion, nutrition, and endocrine status. This article depicts the local mechanisms of repair with special attention to the means by which physiologic and nutritional support at the clinical level influence repair, even to a point at which wound healing may exceed contemporary expectations. Without appropriate physiologic, nutritional, and endocrine support, wound healing often fails totally. It is now possible, although not always easy, to achieve optimal physiologic support.\r"

These injuries are the result of a complex set of wounding mechanisms that can be significantly modified by other important wound variables. Mechanisms of surface trauma can be divided into two categories -- mechanical and thermal. Mechanical forces include shearing, tension, and compression. The last produces the greatest degree of tissue trauma and can complicate wound repair and healing. Thermal injuries are mediated through radiation, convection, conduction, electricity, and excessive cold. Factors that can modify the mechanism of injury are the wounding material and biologic variables, including the anatomic site of injury, underlying health status, and current use of medications. A working knowledge of wounding mechanisms and their related clinical considerations can be useful in the selection of wound management techniques and in predicting eventual wound outcome.\r"

The dynamics of this exchange of energy will determine the magnitude of injury. Disruption of the body covering leaves the once-sterile underlying integument exposed to contamination. The contaminants are derived from either the victim (endogenous) or the exogenous energy source. The presence of a contaminant such as bacteria makes the care of the wound an exercise in microbiology. Other contaminants, such as dirt, also may reside in the recesses of the wound. Emergency physicians must understand the consequences of tissue trauma. A study of the mechanism of injury will provide a reliable indication of damages. Whether the tissue injury will be limited to the initial wounding depends on the outcome of the interaction between the contaminants and the wound. In the event that the contaminants are very reactive, a relatively insignificant wound may become a catastrophe. This circumstance can be averted by the implementation of a well-devised plan based on the biology of wound healing and infection.\r"

Regardless of severity, the emergency physician and staff must possess the evaluative skills and knowledge of current treatment regimens to appropriately treat these patients. Burn injuries are classified according to extent of body surface involved and depth of skin injury. This classification, together with an understanding of the pathophysiology based on the source of injury, will allow categorization and thereby determine initial therapy and definitive management. The treatment of minor burns focuses on three primary objectives: relief of pain, prevention of infection and additional trauma, and minimizing of scarring and contracture. With major burns the first hours after injury are characterized by life-threatening problems. Airway injuries, trauma other than the burn injury, treatment of shock, and pain relief are of the highest priority, overriding the management of the burn wound itself. The care that the minor burn victim receives is critical to ultimate outcome; the care that the major burn victim receives is critical to both immediate survival and ultimate outcome. The emergency physician must provide optimal care to ensure optimal results.\r"

Victims die as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, and smoke inhalation. These deaths can occur without thermal wounds as well as with burn injuries. There are three distinct problems with inhalation injuries: thermal burns of the upper airway, carbon monoxide poisoning, and smoke inhalation. Each has different symptoms and signs, different treatment, and different prognosis. Thermal burns occurring in the upper airway are usually manifested within 48 hours of injury. Diagnosis is made by direct visualization of the upper airway, looking for signs of thermal injury. Admission for observation with humidified oxygen, attentive pulmonary toilet, bronchodilators as needed, and prophylactic endotracheal intubation as indicated are the mainstays of treatment. Resolution of the injury usually occurs within days. Carbon monoxide poisoning, the most common cause of death in inhalation injury, is a result of combustion. Symptoms and signs correlate with blood levels, but arterial blood gases are used to determine the degree of carbon monoxide intoxication. Treatment is based on the principle that carbon monoxide dissociation occurs much faster if the patient is placed on 100% oxygen. Occasionally the patient's symptoms may persist or get worse despite adequate treatment. Smoke inhalation significantly damages normal respiratory physiology, resulting in injury progressing from acute pulmonary insufficiency to pulmonary edema to bronchopneumonia, depending on the severity of exposure. Diagnosis is based on history, but clinical findings, arterial blood gases, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are helpful. Treatment is supportive with careful attention paid to fluid resuscitation in the patient with burns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89060623\r", 
  ".W": "In the last decade much progress has been made in our understanding of animal bites. Two major areas of remaining controversy are discussed. Recent study of human bites has shown that the early literature depicting all human bites as having an extraordinarily high infection and complication rate was biased by its emphasis on human bites of the hand that presented late with infection already present. These bites, the so-called closed-fist injuries (CFI), do indeed have a poor prognosis, but it may be as much due to their location and initial neglect as to the source of the injury. Human bites elsewhere do not seem to have any higher risk than animal bites, which have an infection rate of about 10%. Human bites of the face, lips, and ears are at very low risk for infection (less than 3%) if properly treated. The CFI should be identified early and aggressively irrigated and debrided (if possible). CFI wounds can be treated on an outpatient basis if uninfected and less than 24 hours old. The economical outpatient antibiotics of choice for CFI are penicillin plus dicloxacillin; the former is needed to cover Eikenella corrodens and the latter to cover Staphylococcus aureus, both common in these wounds. Diabetics with hand infection frequently have Gram-negative infection and may warrant parenteral aminoglycosides. Second- and third-generation cephalosporins are very effective but should be reserved for special situations due to their expense. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for typical bite wounds, which are low risk. The choice of antibiotic (when needed) in other bite wounds is a matter of confusion, because the only scientific data available are in vitro sensitivities, which are a very poor and crude reflection of the clinical reality. Antibiotic effectiveness in vivo is dependent on a complex summation of absorption, tissue levels (not just serum levels), host immune defenses, and the interrelationships between bacterial species present. For dog bite wounds, dicloxacillin and cephalexin are both good choices because they cover most of the broad spectrum of infecting pathogens; dicloxacillin is significantly cheaper.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Plain and mammographic radiography, xeroradiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography can be used to detect foreign bodies suspected during clinical evaluation. The exact position of an object buried in soft tissue is difficult to determine using two-dimensional imaging techniques. Surface markers, multiple-projection radiographs, wire grids, fluoroscopy, or stereotaxic devices may help to locate it.

In the present study, concentrations of tryptase and histamine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as indicators of pulmonary mast cell activation. BALF was obtained before and after endobronchial allergen challenge and assessed for mediator content and cell composition in 4 subject groups: nonatopic nonasthmatics (Group 1, n = 7), nonatopic asthmatics (Group 2, n = 3), atopic nonasthmatics (Group 3, n = 7), and atopic asthmatics (Group 4, n = 7). Before challenge, histamine concentrations were not different between the 4 groups, whereas tryptase concentrations were significantly greater in the atopic asthmatics than in each of the other groups (p less than 0.04). Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases above baseline in mean +/- SD histamine (0.7 +/- 7.1 to 2.8 +/- 2.0 ng/ml) and tryptase (2.0 +/- 1.7 to 10.1 +/- 8.2 ng/ml) concentrations in BALF (p less than 0.03).

Though the histamine values were not significantly different between atopic nonasthmatics and atopic asthmatics after allergen challenge, tryptase concentrations were markedly higher in the atopic asthmatic group. The numbers, as well as the predominance of the T mast cell type in atopic asthmatics and nonasthmatics, were no different from controls. In nonatopic subjects, regardless of asthmatic state, histamine or tryptase concentrations were not altered by allergen challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animals were actively sensitized and 2 wk later were challenged through the airways. Airway responses of sensitized animals were compared to those of 6 control animals challenged with sufficient methacholine (MCh) to at least double RL and to 4 unsensitized control rats challenged with OA. Ten of 15 rats in the experimental group displayed an early response (ER), defined as an increase in RL of at least 50% within 1 h of challenge. A late response (LR) was considered to have occurred when the value of RL exceeded the mean plus 2 standard deviations of all the measurements taken from 1 h after challenge to the end of the experiment. Two rats died less than 240 min after OA challenge with RL greater than 200% baseline. The remaining 13 were studied for a total duration that ranged from 390 to 720 min and of these animals 10 demonstrated LRs. Maximal RL during the LR after OA was 287 +/- 49% (SE) baseline (range, 129 to 760) versus 115 +/- 15% (75 to 176) for control animals after MCh (p less than 0.01) and 52 +/- 3% (51 to 142; p less than 0.01) for unsensitized control animals after OA. There was no correlation between the magnitude of ER and LR; 3 LRs occurred in the absence of detectable ERs.

  ".W": "The mammalian tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) are known to be present in sensory airway nerves of animals and humans. We studied the effect of mammalian and nonmammalian tachykinins on the conducting airways of anesthetized, mechanically ventilated Fisher 344 rats. Dose-dependent increases in lung resistance and decreases in dynamic compliance occurred after the intravenous administration of eledoisin (E), kassinin (K), NKA, and SP. E, K, and NKA were more potent bronchoconstrictors than was SP. Neurokinin B (NKB) caused a similar decrease in dynamic compliance, but had no effect on lung resistance. This order of potency suggests a predominance of NK-2 receptors in the rat airways. Both atropine and the 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist methysergide largely reduced the bronchoconstriction induced by E and SP. Vagotomy did not change this reaction, whereas pretreatment with the ganglion blocker hexamethonium slightly enhanced the bronchoconstrictor action of E and SP. Sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium, 2 drugs that can inhibit mediator release from inflammatory cells, significantly reduced the bronchoconstrictor action of NKA. Ketotifen, an antihistamine with mast-cell-stabilizing properties, significantly reduced the bronchoconstriction induced by E, whereas the H1-receptor antagonist clemastine had no effect. We conclude that tachykinins cause bronchoconstriction in rats largely by an indirect mechanism, involving both acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. We suggest that tachykinins cause bronchoconstriction by stimulation of postganglionic vagal nerve endings and mast cells.\r"

Seven patients were randomized into Group 1 who received their normal diet during Months 1 to 3, a supplemented diet during Months 4 to 6, and their original normal diet during Months 7 to 9. The other 7 patients received their normal diet for the entire 9-month study period (Group 2). Seven well-nourished patients (Group 3) matched for age and severity of air-flow obstruction served as control subjects; they received their normal diet for the 9-month study period. Measurements of nutritional status, respiratory muscle and handgrip strength, sternomastoid muscle function (including frequency/force curves, maximal relaxation rate, and a fatigability test), lung function, arterial blood gas tensions, general well-being and breathlessness scores, and 6-min walking distances were carried out monthly in all patients. At the start of the study, the poorly nourished patients had lower mean daily calorie and protein intakes than did the well-nourished patients. The poorly nourished patients had lower respiratory muscle and handgrip strength, and abnormal contractility and increased fatigability of the sternomastoid muscle compared with those in the well-nourished patients. After 3 months of supplementary oral nutrition, there was a significant improvement in the nutritional status of Group 1 patients, as evidenced by an increase in body weight, triceps skinfold thickness, and midarm muscle circumference. Respiratory muscle and handgrip strength increased in parallel with nutritional status, although there were no significant changes in lung function or arterial blood gas tensions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89060664\r", 
  ".W": "The intratracheal administration of bleomycin in rats elicits an acute inflammatory response in the lung followed by the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The alveolar macrophage (AM) is a key effector cell involved in this process because of its potential to release a variety of hormonelike molecules (cytokines) that can modulate systemic responses as well as the local response of other lung cells including the interstitial fibroblast. In this report, we have documented the chronology of the in vitro spontaneous release of AM cytokines after a single instillation of bleomycin. We show that supernatants from AM harvested after the administration of bleomycin but not after saline contain lymphocyte-activating factor (interleukin-1) activity. Maximal activity was detected between 6 and 12 h and was barely detectable by Day 7 after bleomycin. In addition, supernatants showing interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity also inhibited the proliferation of log-phase normal rat lung fibroblasts. Fractionation of supernatants from AM harvested 6 h after bleomycin demonstrated that both lymphocyte-activating factor and fibroblast modulatory activity coelute in the same 18-kDa region, suggesting that IL-1 may demonstrate both activities. We also report here the spontaneous release of a second AM cytokine, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, which we have recently shown in humans to be identical to interferon beta 2 and which initiates the hepatic acute-phase protein response. The release of this 30-kDa cytokine from AM of rats exposed to bleomycin has a different chronology than does IL-1, showing a steady increase over time, with maximal activity at Day 28 after bleomycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was shown to reduce lung water content in this type of edema, but its possible effects on cellular lesions were not documented. We compared the consequences of normal tidal volume ventilation in mechanically ventilated rats at a high airway pressure (HiP-LoV) with those of high tidal volume ventilation at a high (HiP-HiV) or low (LoP-HiV) airway pressure and the effects of PEEP (10 cm H2O) on both edema and lung ultrastructure. Pulmonary edema was assessed by extravascular lung water content and microvascular permeability by the drug lung weight and the distribution space of 125I-labeled albumin. HiP-LoV rat lungs were not different from those of controls (7 cm H2O peak pressure ventilation). By contrast, the lungs from the groups submitted to high volume ventilation had significant permeability type edema. This edema was more pronounced in LoP-HiV rats. It was markedly reduced by PEEP, which, in addition, preserved the normal ultrastructural aspect of the alveolar epithelium. This was in striking contrast to the diffuse alveolar damage usually encountered in this type of edema. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of a protective effect of PEEP during permeability edema.\r"

  ".U": "89060674\r", 
  ".W": "Airway smooth muscle responses are elicited in a complex manner through a large variety of endogenous mediators. Mediators augment or inhibit bronchomotor tone at a variety of sites through numerous different mechanisms. Interactions occur among mediators and nerves, muscle, and circulating blood elements or respiratory mast cells. Airway smooth muscle tone further is regulated by postsynaptic mediator-mediator interactions. Substances may circulate through the blood from distal sites to reach their target organ, as with epinephrine in its effects on airway smooth muscle, or may be secreted directly onto airway smooth muscle, as with the secretory products of respiratory mast cells. Recent observations have indicated that some mediators elicit airway contraction at least in part by activating efferent parasympathetic nerves and/or platelets. Direct secretion of minute quantities of mediators from adjacent epithelium or from infiltrating leukocytes may be an essential component of airway hyperreactivity. Complex interactions between the complement and kallikrein cascades have been cited as possible mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness. Ultimately, bronchomotor tone is mediated postsynaptically by the availability of calcium to the contractile apparatus of the smooth muscle cell. A role for the phosphoinositide system in membrane transduction and for cyclic adenosine monophosphate in regulating calcium distribution for smooth muscle contraction has been implicated. Mediator-mediator interactions distal to the synaptic cleft have been shown to augment both force and duration of airway smooth muscle contraction in a synergistic fashion. The stimuli eliciting mediator and neurotransmitter secretion, their physiologic significance, and the homeostatic infrastructure of these interactions are areas of promising investigation that require further definition.\r"

Insulin-treated diabetic and normal rats similarly fed, and undernourished rats weight-matched to the untreated diabetics, served as comparison groups. The ratio of unbound [14C]hydroxyproline to total [14C]hydroxyproline in the lung was used to assess connective tissue degradation. Compared to the normal group, the untreated diabetic animals showed similar synthesis of collagen and elastin, reduced synthesis of total protein and DNA, and decreased degradation of connective tissue. When compared with the normal group, the undernourished animals showed diminished synthesis of total protein, collagen, elastin, and DNA, and increased degradation of connective tissue. In comparison to the undernourished group, the untreated diabetic animals indicated increased synthesis of collagen and elastin, and diminished degradation of connective tissue; total protein and DNA syntheses were similar. The insulin-treated diabetic animals showed increased collagen and DNA synthesis. We conclude that experimental diabetes has a profound effect on lung connective tissue metabolism, supporting previous observations of connective tissue abnormalities and morphometric changes. The increase in lung collagen and elastin in diabetes is in part due to reduced breakdown of the connective tissue proteins.\r"

  ".W": "To diminish the work of breathing, some demand valve systems are equipped with inspiratory pressure support (IPS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the work performed during spontaneous breathing using the Siemens Servo 900C ventilator (SVC) at the minimal IPS level available, and comparing it with a demand valve ventilator without IPS, the Ohmeda CPU1 (CPU1), and with a home-built continuous flow system (CFS). We found a larger minute ventilation and inspiratory peak flow with the SVC and the CFS than with the CPU1 (p less than 0.05). When the work of breathing was measured at the airway opening, we found that the CFS led to the least amount of work (0.17 +/- 0.05 J.L-1, p less than 0.05). Additionally, this work was strikingly less for SVC than for CPU1 (0.22 +/- 0.06 versus 0.42 +/- 0.10 J.L-1, p less than 0.001) as a result of a higher flow supplied by the SVC. By contrast, the work measured using the esophageal pressure, i.e., including the work dissipated on the lung and airways, was significantly reduced with the CFS (1.34 +/- 0.45 J.L-1, p less than 0.05), but surprisingly not different between SVC and CPU1 (1.49 +/- 0.57 versus 1.54 +/- 0.51 J.L-1). We conclude that the absence of a demand valve in CFS involves the lowest work of breathing. Likewise, the high flow capability in SVC reduces the work necessary to overcome the circuit and demand valve resistances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After completing a standardized questionnaire and undergoing a physical examination, throat-culturing, and pulmonary function testing, subjects took the active drug or identical-appearing placebo for 7 days while they kept a diary in which they ranked the severity of 17 symptoms for 14 days. Pulmonary function testing was repeated, on average, on Days 4, 8, and 14. Forty-six percent of the variation in cough severity could be explained by throat-clearing and 47% of the variation in throat-clearing severity by postnasal drip. FIF50%, the only physiologic parameter that significantly correlated with cough, rose as cough severity fell. Antihistamine-decongestant therapy reduced postnasal drip and significantly decreased the severity of cough, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and throat-clearing during the first few days of the common cold. In addition, cough was 20 to 30% less prevalent in the active drug group within 3 days of starting therapy. We conclude that the cough of the common cold arose from upper respiratory tract stimuli and that cough and other cardinal symptoms of the common cold were reduced with antihistamine-decongestant therapy when these symptoms were at their worst.\r"

The provocative dose of methacholine that produced a 10 and 20% decrease of baseline FEV1 (PD10,20 FEV1) and the maximal fall in FEV1 (MFEV1) at the response plateau to inhaled methacholine were determined prior to surgery. Small airway smooth muscle preparations, obtained from the 10 resected lung tissue specimens, were examined in vitro to determine the sensitivity (-log EC50) and maximal isotonic shortening (Smax) to methacholine. In addition, the relaxation responses to the beta-agonist I-isoproterenol were measured. The degree of small airways disease (SAD) was examined histologically. Nine subjects showed a maximal response plateau to inhaled methacholine in vivo. The maximal fall in FEV1 at the plateau was 26 +/- 3%. All airway smooth muscle preparations (n = 30) contracted to methacholine (-log EC50, 5.94 +/- 0.09; Smax, 1320 +/- 219 micron) and relaxed to I-isoproterenol (-log EC50, 7.60 +/- 0.11; maximal relaxation [Rmax], 87 +/- 3%). No significant correlations were found between Smax or Rmax of the airway smooth muscle in vitro and the MFEV1 in vivo, and between -log EC50 for methacholine or I-isoproterenol in vitro and PD10 or PD20 FEV1 for methacholine in vivo. The severity of SAD was significantly correlated with the degree of baseline airflow limitation (p less than 0.05), but not with in vivo or in vitro responses to methacholine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five groups of guinea pigs were studied over a period of 8 h.

Arterial blood gases, arterial blood pressure, and blood WBC counts were monitored serially for 8 h. Lung water (wet-to-dry ratio), the concentration ratio of 125I-labeled albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid to that in plasma (albumin index; AI), total cell count in BAL fluid, thiobarbituric-acid-reactive material (TBARM), and the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (beta-G) were examined. Lung tissue was studied histologically to assess neutrophil accumulation. Our results showed that E. coli septicemia caused significant peripheral neutropenia and histopathologic evidence of neutrophil alveolitis associated with an increased ratio of TBARM and beta-G in BAL fluid as compared with those in plasma (TBARM BAL ratio and beta-G BAL ratio).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate whether such a nonantigenic stimulus induces a late-phase reaction (LPR) in the nose, we challenged 12 preselected volunteers who had previously shown an immediate response to CDA. We monitored the subjects' responses for 10 h by means of symptom diaries and the levels of histamine and TAME-esterase activity in nasal lavage fluids. All 12 subjects showed an immediate response, whereas 8 had a LPR, as indicated by a recurrence of symptoms (rhinorrhea and congestion) hours later, accompanied by an increase in the levels of histamine and TAME-esterase activity. Rhinorrhea and congestion were concomitant with the late reelevation of mediators. Control challenges of these subjects with warm, moist air (WMA), as well as serial nasal lavages without any stimulation of the nose, failed to induce an early- or a late-phase response. The amount of both mediators and symptoms generated during the 10 h after the initial reaction to CDA challenge was significantly greater (p less than 0.02) than after WMA challenge or after performance of nasal lavages without a challenge. The ability of CDA to induce a LPR strengthens the connection between initial mast-cell activation and the occurrence of a LPR.\r"

Nasal lavages obtained at baseline and after provocation were analyzed for albumin, total protein, secretory IgA (sIgA), and total IgA. Compared with baseline levels or saline provocation, MC provocation increased the secretion of albumin (p less than 0.025), total protein (p less than 0.001), sIgA (p less than 0.025), and total IgA (p less than 0.025), but did not significantly affect the relative proportions of albumin-to-total protein (albumin percent) or sIgA-to-total IgA (sIgA/total IgA ratio). Nasal pretreatment with atropine significantly inhibited MC-induced secretion of all 4 proteins, again without affecting the albumin percent or the sIgA/total IgA ratio. Because MC is known to stimulate atropine-inhibitable secretion of glandular products, these data suggest that sIgA and albumin may accompany glandular secretions. Immunohistochemical analyses of nasal turbinates confirmed that secretory component was found only on serous cells within submucous glands. Thus, it appears that cholinergic stimulation may regulate sIgA secretion and thereby participate in local nasal (and possibly respiratory tract) immunity.\r"

Lavage fluids of 72 subjects were analyzed by 3 techniques: glass cover, filter, and cytocentrifuge preparations. Seventy-seven other lavages were analyzed by glass cover and cytocentrifuge preparations alone. Data for the 72 subjects studied by all 3 techniques showed that the cell counts on glass cover and filter preparations were similar, e.g., lymphocytes, 19.2% (range, 0.5 to 94%) and 20.9% (range, 3 to 95%), respectively (Spearman's correlation coefficient, 0.98). However, on cytocentrifuge preparations, lymphocyte counts were lower (8.3%; range, zero to 87%) and macrophage counts were higher (p less than 0.005). Comparison of glass cover and cytocentrifuge preparation mixtures with varying amounts (20 to 80%) of purified blood leukocytes labeled with 51Cr (greater than or equal to 72% lymphocytes) showed that a significant amount of radioactive cells was lost during the cytocentrifuge technique in contrast to the glass cover technique. Because neutrophils represented a low proportion of lavage cells, we also evaluated cell suspensions with known neutrophil contents (10 to 70%); we found no difference in neutrophil counts obtained with the 3 techniques. Lavage data analysis of 40 young nonsmoking volunteers showed that glass cover lymphocyte count was also higher than counts on cytocentrifuge preparations: 16.5% (range, 3 to 45%) and 8.2% (range, 2.5 to 35%), respectively. In this group, the distribution of glass cover lymphocyte percentages was normal (p = 0.21, chi 2 test), and the one-tailed 95% confidence interval was 18.6 to 34.7% (mean plus 1.65 standard deviation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To document the long-term prognosis of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated between 1971 and 1975 and to determine how the prognosis varies by histologic subtype and stage. SETTING: Three cancer referral centers in the United States and one center in Italy. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 1153 previously untreated patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At the time of analysis, 71% of the patients had died and the median follow-up for patients still alive was 11.2 years. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The 10-year survival proportions were 45% (CI, 40% to 50%); 26% (CI, 22% to 30%); and 23% (CI, 18% to 30%) for patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-grade lymphomas, respectively. Patients with intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas were curable, but this was not apparent for patients with advanced stage low-grade lymphomas. For the low-grade follicular small cleaved and follicular mixed lymphomas, the Ann Arbor staging system distinguished the prognosis of patients with stage I disease from those with more extensive involvement. For the diffuse large cell and immunoblastic lymphomas, the Ann Arbor staging system distinguished long-term prognosis for patients with stage I disease from patients with stage II disease and those with more disseminated involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of long-term survival for unselected patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be substantial. Long-term prognosis depends on the histologic subtype of the tumor and the extent of dissemination. The Working Formulation for non-Hodgkin lymphomas is a simple and useful nomenclature for selecting treatment and reporting results. The Ann Arbor staging system is a useful but imperfect prognostic indicator.\r"

Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences were detected in DNA isolated from lymph node biopsies from two of the patients. Initially, no abnormalities in the numbers of B and T cells could be detected. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients did not react in the mixed lymphocyte culture assay. We suggest that an immune deficiency to Epstein-Barr virus may favor the proliferation of malignant lymphocytes after Epstein-Barr viral infection. Monoclonal lymphoid B cell lines established spontaneously in vitro from a lymph node biopsy specimen and from peripheral blood specimens from two of the patients. The cells harbor Epstein-Barr viral DNA sequences in multiple genome equivalents and express Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen. The cells contain a tenfold increased level of c-fgr-related RNA transcripts compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy adults. No obvious amplifications or translocations of the c-myc, c-abl, or c-fgr gene could be detected.\r"

  ".W": "Immunosuppressed patients are at risk for developing cytomegalovirus retinitis. This disorder is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cytomegalovirus retinitis is probably the result of hematogenous spread of the virus to the retina after systemic reactivation of a latent cytomegalovirus infection. Although the ophthalmic infection may initially be asymptomatic, the retinal necrosis it produces may result in both loss of visual field and decreased visual acuity. Routine screening of these patients is required for early diagnosis. The retinitis is detected with ophthalmoscopy as either a perivascular yellow-white retinal lesion frequently associated with retinal hemorrhage or as a focal white granular infiltrate, often without hemorrhage. Both lesions enlarge in a progressively expanding \"brushfire\" pattern. The diagnosis of cytomegalovirus retinitis, as well as the evaluation of its response to therapy, is determined primarily by clinical criteria. Serial retinal photography is an objective method to assess the changing appearance of these lesions. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are investigational antiviral drugs that appear to be effective in treating cytomegalovirus retinitis. However, maintenance therapy with these medications is required after initial treatment because the disease often relapses. The combined expertise of the internist and the ophthalmologist is needed to diagnose and treat these patients.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from January 1982 to June 1988 were identified through a search of the English-language literature using MEDLINE and thorough extensive hand searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All consecutive patient series and randomized trials of coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. DATA EXTRACTION: Demographic characteristics, technical results, clinical outcomes, and left ventricular function results were collated. RESULTS of DATA SYNTHESIS: Three randomized trials have compared immediate and deferred coronary angioplasty after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Immediate angioplasty was associated with increased mortality, increased need for emergency bypass surgery, higher transfusion requirement, and no benefit in terms of left ventricular functional recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The role of coronary angioplasty for myocardial infarction has thus far been established as adjunctive, in a delayed time frame after thrombolytic therapy. Coronary angioplasty has not been shown to reduce in-hospital mortality or improve resting left ventricular function. A deferred strategy has improved exercise left ventricular performance, and several follow-up studies suggest a favorable long-term prognosis.\r"

HPA-23 was fairly well tolerated at doses of 1.0 mg/kg or less; nearly 60% of patients given 2.0 mg/kg discontinued treatment. Twenty-six patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events or concurrent illness. HPA-23 produced dose-related decreases in platelet count and increases in serum glutamine oxalacetic transaminase. There were no changes in immune system function, as determined by total lymphocyte count, T4-cell count, T8-cell count, and T4/T8 ratio. The effects of HPA-23 seemed to be more closely related to the total dose than to the daily dose. No improvement in the clinical status of the patients was observed during the 8 weeks of treatment.\r"

Antibiotic medium no. 3 was used as the standard medium. Isolates of C. albicans and C. tropicalis demonstrated a paradoxical effect in Sabouraud dextrose broth and yeast nitrogen base broth in that growth was partially inhibited at MICs equivalent to those in antibiotic medium no. 3, but growth continued, in many instances, throughout all concentrations tested. There was decreased activity of cilofungin with inocula greater than 10(5) CFU/ml. The temperature and duration of incubation did not affect its activity.\r"

Nevertheless, the compound had significant activity in a lethal rat Escherichia coli peritonitis model at serum concentrations of one-tenth the MIC against the infecting organism. The drug demonstrated only bacteriostatic activity against susceptible organisms. Studies to define the mechanism of antibacterial action revealed that S-6123 inhibited ribosomal protein synthesis without inhibiting DNA or RNA synthesis. This compound represents a new series of antibacterial agents not related to any other antibacterial compound of natural or synthetic origin.\r"

The inoculum size, incubation time, and enhancers were defined for the assessment of chlamydial antigen synthesis in HeLa 229 cells seeded as monolayers in 96-well plates. MICs were determined and defined as the lowest antibiotic concentrations required to inhibit, after 24 or 48 h of incubation, antigen production as determined by the EIA. The MICs (after 48 h) were similar to those determined by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining of inclusions. MIC determinations after 24 h were suitable for screening the activities of quinolones, but less so for measuring the susceptibility of C. trachomatis to macrolides and tetracyclines. MIC determination by EIA was rapid, appropriate for standardization, and less cumbersome than determination by quantification of inclusions.\r"

Most studies have focused on the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of this compound. In this study, we report that berberine sulfate is bacteriostatic for streptococci and that sub-MICs of berberine blocked the adherence of streptococci to host cells, immobilized fibronectin, and hexadecane. Concentrations of berberine below its MIC caused an eightfold increase in release of lipoteichoic acid from the streptococci. Higher concentrations of berberine directly interfered with the adherence of streptococci to host cells either by preventing the complexing of lipoteichoic acid with fibronectin or by dissolution of such complexes once they were formed. Thus, berberine sulfate interferes with the adherence of group A streptococci by two distinct mechanisms: one by releasing the adhesin lipoteichoic acid from the streptococcal cell surface and another by directly preventing or dissolving lipoteichoic acid-fibronectin complexes.\r"

  ".U": "89061006\r",

Mutants with stably derepressed beta-lactamase expression occur in inducible populations at frequencies in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-8). The contribution of these beta-lactamases to drug resistance was examined in Morganella morganii and Proteus vulgaris. The M. morganii enzyme was a high-molecular-weight (49,000) class I cephalosporinase with low Vmax rates for ampicillin, carbenicillin, and and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The P. vulgaris enzyme had a lower molecular weight (32,000) and high Vmax rates for ampicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. Imipenem and cefoxitin inactivated the P. vulgaris enzyme but were low-Vmax, low-Km substrates for that of M. morganii. Despite these differences, the two beta-lactamases caused similar resistance profiles. Ampicillin and cephaloridine were strong inducers for both species, and beta-lactamase-inducible strains and their stably derepressed mutants were resistant, whereas basal mutants (those with low-level uninducible beta-lactamase) were susceptible to these two compounds. Mezlocillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and (usually) carbenicillin were almost equally active against beta-lactamase-inducible organisms and their basal mutants, but were less active against stably derepressed mutants. This behavior reflected the beta-lactamase lability of these drugs, coupled with their weak inducer activity below the MIC. Carbenicillin was a labile strong inducer for a single P. vulgaris strain, and inducible enzyme was protective against the drug in this atypical organism. Cefoxitin and imipenem, both strong inducers below the MIC, were almost equally active against beta-lactamase-inducible organisms and their basal and stably derepressed mutants.\r"

Alarcon, and L. Carrasco, J. Med. Chem. 28:40-46, 1985), has a potent and selective activity against the intracellular and extracellular stages of Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro. It had a 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 5 micrograms/ml for T. cruzi extracellular cultured forms (epimastigote) and of 25 micrograms/ml for T. cruzi intracellular forms (amastigote) growing inside J774G8 macrophagelike cells. In contrast, the 50% inhibitory concentration was 100 micrograms/ml or greater for cultured mammalian cells and 180 micrograms/ml for the proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes. Furthermore, the addition of P536 (50 micrograms/ml) to T. cruzi-infected J774G8 cells cured the infected macrophages, making them able to grow and function normally. Studies on the mechanism of action of this drug indicated that it inhibited incorporation of [35S]methionine, [3H]thymidine, [3H]mannose, [14C]-N-acetylglucosamine, and [3H]uridine into macromolecules by T. cruzi epimastigotes, the last being the most sensitive.\r"

No correlation between age and HbA1 concentration was found indicating that factors other than progressive pancreatic fibrosis may be important in the aetiology. HLA typing, islet cell antibodies, and autoantibody screen were completed. Eighteen (75%) out of 24 patients with cystic fibrosis who had an impaired glucose tolerance had HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4 antigens compared with 23 (62%) out of 37 patients with normal glucose tolerance. Islet cell antibodies were present in seven (15%) out of 46 patients with cystic fibrosis; the prevalence in a normal population is 0.5%. Five (25%) of the 20 patients with a raised HbA1 concentration were positive for islet cell antibodies compared with two (8%) out of the 26 with normal glucose tolerance. Six (86%) out of seven patients who were positive for islet cell antibodies had HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4 antigens. There was no general autoantibody production. Islet cell antibodies may play a part in the development of glucose intolerance in some patients with cystic fibrosis by being produced in those who are genetically predisposed as part of an immune response to damaged pancreatic tissue.\r"

Ultrasound examination of the fetus was performed as part of the routine antenatal assessment at 16-20 weeks' gestation, and later examinations were done if there were obstetric indications. Fetuses with any degree of dilatation of the renal pelvis or other renal tract anomalies were followed up with serial ultrasound examinations in utero and then postnatally at 6 days and 6 weeks of age, or earlier if indicated. No renal tract anomalies were detected before 28 weeks' gestation, but of 761 fetuses examined later, 62 had dilatation of the renal pelvis not associated with overdistended bladders, and one fetus was anephric. After birth 10 of these infants (16%) were found to have pronounced renal tract abnormalities. Three who had associated serious congenital abnormalities died, five infants had obstruction of the pelviureteric junction, and two infants had vesicoureteric reflux. Antenatal ultrasonographic examination after 28 weeks identifed pronounced renal tract abnormalities in asymptomatic infants with a frequency of 9.2/1000 births (seven of 761) thus permitting early treatment and reducing the incidence of late complications.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac transplantation was carried out in a 40-year-old man with the diagnosis of repaired transposition of the great arteries and right-sided aortic arch who had end-stage cardiac failure due to myopathy of the ventricles. Because of several previous surgical repairs and the orientation of the great vessels, the operation presented some technical problems. Therefore, modifications of operative procedures were used, including recipient hypothermia, circulatory arrest, and changes in the donor heart implantation. The removal of the donor heart was modified in such a way that the graft included the aortic arch and both pulmonary arteries. With the extra length of ascending aorta and transverse arch, the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian vessels were excised as a button, thereby leaving the distal orifice of the aorta in the superior portion of the transverse arch. For the recipient, the operation was performed using hypothermic total circulatory arrest to dissect free the huge pulmonary artery and the short right-sided aortic arch to place the clamp. Implantation of the donor heart was modified accordingly. The technical results were confirmed one and a half months later on a control digital angiogram. Thirty-five days postoperatively the patient was discharged. Six months after operation, the patient is doing better than ever before in his life. Our findings suggest that a complicated conotruncal development does not preclude cardiac transplantation.\r"

Group 2 (N = 3) underwent total cardiac denervation with placement of ventricular wires. Group 3 (N = 8) underwent total cardiac denervation with subsequent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and collaterals to the apex. Group 4 (N = 9) underwent coronary artery ligation only. Chronic electrophysiological studies were conducted in all groups in the conscious state. Electrophysiological variables were determined from continuous Holter monitoring of the ECG, determination of strength-interval curves, and assessment of the inducibility of ventricular tachycardia by premature programmed pacing. In general, the denervated, infarcted group (Group 3) consistently demonstrated a greater level of electrical stability than the infarcted animals with normal innervation (Group 4).\r"

To evaluate methods for improving oxygen transport during one-lung ventilation, we applied high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the nondependent lung following deflation to atmospheric pressure in each procedure, and measured the effects on cardiac output and arterial oxygenation. In each case, the dependent lung was ventilated with conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Eight patients were studied during posterolateral thoracotomy using double-lumen endobronchial tubes. HFJV or CPAP to the nondependent lung improved arterial oxygenation significantly during both closed and open stages of the surgical procedures (p less than 0.008). When the chest was open, HFJV maintained satisfactory cardiac output, whereas CPAP usually decreased cardiac output (p less than 0.008). There were no significant differences in mean partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide between HFJV, CPAP, and deflation to atmospheric pressure. In conclusion, HFJV to the nondependent lung provides not only satisfactory oxygenation but also good cardiac output, thereby maintaining better oxygen transport than CPAP or deflation to atmospheric pressure, while the dependent lung is ventilated with IPPV during one-lung ventilation for thoracotomy.\r"

The arterial PGI2 levels in the IABCP group increased from control values of 95 +/- 20 pg/ml to 268 +/- 95 pg/ml at 1 hour, 429 +/- 95 pg/ml at 4 hours, and 1,884 +/- 532 pg/ml at 24 hours. The arterial PGI2 levels were consistently higher in the IABCP group. Although the TXB2 measurements revealed no significant differences between groups, the IABCP group consistently had a higher level than the sham group. The platelet count in the control group decreased to 45% of baseline levels versus 55% for the IABCP group. We conclude that prolonged IABCP results in either net production of PGI2 or decreased degradation. The correlation between TXB2 and platelet counts is unclear and remains to be defined.\r"

As the incidence of occurrence of a pulmonary carcinoma in association with bullous disease is high, these radiographic findings will aid in early detection of a malignant lesion.\r"

Proven sources of infections at different institutions include contaminated porcine valves and municipal water supply, but the mode of transmission in the great majority of patients remains unclear. There are two principal clinical forms of atypical mycobacterial infections after cardiac operations--endocarditis and sternal osteomyelitis. The latter has characteristics resembling tuberculotic \"cold abscess.\" Specialized laboratory testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, and surgeons may have to take the initiative to request special microbiological investigation in cases where infection is clinically suspected but routine cultures are reported as \"negative.\" The prognosis for patients who have any atypical mycobacterial infection after a heart operation is severe. Those infected with the strain chelonei and those whose cardiac chambers were entered during operation fare worse. This dim clinical prognosis may be improved by appropriate and aggressive antibiotic and surgical therapy. Awareness of the urgency of special bacteriological studies is the key to successful management.\r"

In normal human life spans, marrow stem cells do not appear to wear out, and, finally, clinicians are cautioned not to attribute anemia per se simply to aging. Any elderly individual with unexplained anemia must be fully evaluated for the possibility of occult gastrointestinal blood loss, marrow failure syndrome, or hemolytic state before his/her anemia is attributed to age alone.

Current evidence suggests a possible link between cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, which have been shown to occur most frequently during the morning hours, and the rapid rise in blood pressure and heart rate during this same time period. We review data from ambulatory blood pressure studies to ascertain which antihypertensive agents provide the most satisfactory control of blood pressure and heart rate during the hours of 6 AM to 12 noon. Of the forms of drug therapy studied, labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-blocker, and two calcium channel blockers, nifedipine and verapamil, appear to be the most effective in blunting the rise in arterial blood pressure during these critical morning hours.\r"

Possible favorable actions of theophylline, including improved mucociliary clearance, stimulation of respiratory drive, enhanced cardiovascular function, and increased diaphragmatic contractility and endurance, have either been shown to be minor in degree, or have not been demonstrated in patients with irreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No well-designed trial has yet shown improved exercise capacity following theophylline treatment in these patients. Nevertheless, considering that some patients benefit symptomatically in the absence of objective improvement, a cautious trial of theophylline appears indicated in patients with severe irreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with discontinuation if there is no objective or subjective improvement. Theophylline therapy should be initiated via the intravenous route during acute exacerbations, but otherwise should start with sustained-release oral preparations of anhydrous theophylline. Oral therapy should begin at low doses in stable patients to avoid side effects, and dosing should take into account the many factors, such as age, cardiovascular and liver function, smoking status, and possible drug interactions, that can affect theophylline metabolism.\r"

Additional analyses focused on the composition of transplant waiting lists and aggregate data from a 1984 census of 1133 dialysis and transplant units. White, male, young, nondiabetic, high-income patients treated in smaller units are more likely to receive a cadaver transplant under Medicare than are other kidney patients. Profit status of the dialysis unit was not found to be correlated to access to transplantation, although size of the unit may be correlated to access. Future analysis should focus on whether patient access has been inappropriately compromised. Possible factors unexplored in this analysis include differential patient preferences and medical suitability, as well as differential medical access.\r"

Our present patient, a 55-year-old woman, had classic symptoms of dry cough, weight loss, malaise, dyspnea, night sweats, and fevers. Significant peripheral blood eosinophilia and a right upper lobe infiltrate were present. Glucocorticoid therapy caused prompt resolution of symptoms, as well as disappearance of blood eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE levels, and pulmonary shadowing. The diagnosis of CEP should not be neglected in the classification of the eosinophilic pneumonias with increased serum IgE levels. The increased serum IgE levels, when present in CEP, seem nonspecific and thus may not be useful as a diagnostic adjunct. However, measurement of IgE may be helpful in CEP, as it has been in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, to guide the dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy.\r"

It is a high-pressure zone with phasic contractions that regulate bile and pancreatic juice flow. The SO is probably regulated by several gastrointestinal hormones, and its basal pressure and phasic contractions can be elevated or decreased significantly by exogenous drugs. Its role in gallstone formation is probably negligible, but severing the SO allows one to extract CBD stones with an endoscope. Abnormal function of the SO can cause biliarylike pain. Of patients with persistent pain after cholecystectomy, 14% have abnormal SO manometric findings. Endoscopic or surgical sphincterotomy can cure these patients of their pain. The SO may play a significant role in the development of pancreatitis in certain patients, either because of the relationship of the CBD orifice to the pancreatic duct orifice created by the SO or because of the response of the SO to exogenous agents, such as alcohol.\r"

A special Substance Abuse Module covers tobacco, alcohol, and other drug abuse in considerable detail, allowing the assessment of the quality and severity of dependence and its course. This article describes the design and development of the CIDI and the current field testing of a slightly reduced \"core\" version. The field test is being conducted in 19 centers around the world to assess the interviews' reliability and its acceptability to clinicians and the general populace in different cultures and to provide data on which to base revisions that may be found necessary. In addition, questions to assess International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, and the revised DSM-III diagnoses are being written. If all goes well, the CIDI will allow investigators reliably to assess mental disorders according to the most widely accepted nomenclatures in many different populations and cultures.\r"

An analysis was made of all respondents in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) project of the Piedmont region of North Carolina who reported suffering from depressive symptoms (n = 406) at the second wave of the ECA study. The analysis identified five profiles of symptoms that adequately described the interrelationships of the symptoms as reported in the population. One profile included a set of symptoms nearly identical to the symptoms associated with the DSM-III classification of major depression. Other depressive syndromes emerged and included a premenstrual syndrome among younger women and a mixed anxiety/depression syndrome. The existence of these other depressive syndromes may explain the present discrepancy in the epidemiologic literature between a high prevalence of depressive symptoms and a low prevalence of traditional depressive diagnoses in community populations.\r"

The goal of this review is to update the clinical neurologist on the current state of progress in neurogenetic research. This progress has been primarily in the field of gene mapping--assigning a disease to its chromosomal locus. More recent advances have been in the cloning and study of the involved proteins in disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The techniques are powerful and predictable in outcome. Knowledge in the field of genetic disorders will continue to expand rapidly. Many neurologic disorders have a genetic origin. As progress continues in the study of neurogenetic diseases, the clinical neurologist will have increasing options for diagnosis and counseling. Eventually, it is anticipated that therapeutic interventions will be available for some disorders. The clinical neurologist is a key worker in both research as well as the practical application of research advances. This review will focus initially and briefly on the basic methods of molecular genetic research. After the introduction to these methods, the remainder of the review will discuss recent advances in several neurogenetic disorders by the clinical neurologist. Gene therapy will also be briefly discussed.\r"

The same two instruments were used, and the sequence of measurement was randomized. Analysis of variance demonstrated no significant difference between measurements obtained with the two tonometers in any of the groups.

SLE sera were screened for the presence of surface neuronal antibodies using a mixed hemadsorption assay. Thirty SLE sera were further tested by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of lysed IMR-6 cells. Western blotting revealed binding to predominantly intracellular antigens, none of which was restricted to neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated binding to a 97K antigen, which appeared to be of surface origin, by 3 SLE sera. This was not present on non-neuronal cells and was not precipitated by sera from healthy or disease controls. This 97K antigen was also precipitated from the neuroblastoma cell line NMB-7, but was not present on SK-N-Mc or SK-N-SH cells. Precipitation was depleted by preabsorption with viable IMR-6 and NMB-7 cells, but not with non-neuronal cells. Thus, some SLE sera recognize a 97K neuronal antigen on select neuroblastoma cells.\r"

Of the patients who received placebo, 52% dropped out due to lack of efficacy of the drug, compared with 16% of patients taking cyclobenzaprine. The dropout rate due to adverse reactions was similar in the 2 groups. Patients taking cyclobenzaprine experienced a significant decrease in the severity of pain and a significant increase in the quality of sleep. There was a trend toward improvement in the symptoms of fatigue, but morning stiffness was not alleviated. These improvements in symptoms were associated with a significant reduction in the total number of tender points and in muscle tightness. Our findings indicate that cyclobenzaprine is a useful adjunct in treating patients with the fibrositis syndrome.\r"

The kinematics and kinetics of the foot and ankle during the three major components of stance phase are reviewed. The first component, between foot contact and foot flat, is characterized primarily by force absorption. The portion of the gait cycle between foot flat and heel off is associated with controlled forward progression of the center of mass and maximum mobility of the transverse tarsal joint. In the third phase, supination of the foot results in increased rigidity of the transverse tarsal joint, and therefore improved force transmission. The controversy regarding the function of the triceps surae during this phase of the gait cycle is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle atrophy, joint stiffness, osteoarthritis, infection, skin necrosis, atrophy and ulceration of joint cartilage and tendocutaneous adhesion are familiar complications produced by prolonged immobilization of surgically repaired tendon ruptures. Because these complications may be minimized by limited immobilization and early functional activities, we studied the effects of early weight bearing on the maximum breaking strength of tenotomized tendons in 30 Wistar rats. After tenotomy, the right hind limb of the first group of 10 rats was immobilized for the first 5 days. Thereafter their casts were removed to permit weight bearing for the next 3 days. In a second group of 10 rats, casts were removed 2 days after surgery, the animals were allowed 3 days of unrestricted use of the limb, and then the limbs were re-casted for another 3 days. In a third group of 10 rats the right hind limbs were casted throughout the first 8 days of healing. At the end of this time, strain gauge measurements showed that tendons in the second group healed significantly stronger and without rerupture than those in either of the two groups. Although healing time in rats does not directly translate to humans, our findings suggest that function may return faster in humans, as, for example, following Achilles tendon rupture, if a better combination of immobilization and activity could be found than is currently employed.\r"

The peptides employed were chosen because of their strong hydrophilicity and in the case of the gp120 peptide because it represents a highly conserved hydrophilic region in the envelope protein. The MAb developed displayed appropriate specificities with their respective peptides and reacted with appropriate HIV-1 components (i.e., a 120 kD glycoprotein and a 27 kD protein, respectively) as determined by Western blot analysis. In indirect immunofluorescence assays the MAb strongly stained syncytia present in cultures of HTLV-3B-infected H9 cells. The MAb to the envelope component reacted with the RF isolate of HIV-1, as well as with the 3B isolate in immunofluorescence.\r"

  ".W": "The simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) in macaques at the Washington Regional Primate Research Center is associated with a type D retrovirus known as SAIDS-D/WA. We tested the ability of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA) to inhibit the in vitro cytopathic effect (syncytium formation) and infectivity of the SAIDS-D/WA virus. Raji cell cultures were infected with virus and treated with various concentrations of AZT, ddC, and ddA. The ability of these drugs to inhibit replication of the SAIDS-D/WA virus in Raji cells was monitored by syncytium formation, expression of viral antigen, and reverse transcriptase assay. At concentrations of 4, 40, and 400 microM, AZT completely blocked the viral infectivity and inhibited the cytopathic effect of SAIDS-D/WA. Likewise, ddC was inhibitory at concentrations of 5 and 50 microM and ddA was inhibitory at 100 and 200 microM. AZT, ddC, and ddA became cytostatic to Raji cells with increasing drug concentrations. AZT also partially inhibited SAIDS-D/WA replication in previously infected Raji cell cultures, and viral inhibition increased in response to the concentration of AZT. These data indicate that AZT, ddC, and ddA are effective antiretroviral agents that merit further evaluation, including clinical trials, in animal models with AIDS-like diseases.\r"

Using an activity gel procedure that allows identification of catalytic polypeptides in situ after PAGE in denaturing conditions, we visualized two major active bands of 66 and 51 kD of reverse transcriptase from highly purified preparations of HIV-1. We show that both p66 and p51 are enzymatically active. An additional active band was also associated with a 165 kD polypeptide, representing about 2-4% of total activity and possibly corresponding to the putative gag-pol precursor. In H9-infected cells the 66 kD active band became visible 70 hours after infection. These studies show that the two major forms of reverse transcriptase (66 and 51 kD) of HIV-1 are independently active and that a higher Mr form of 165 kD is also enzymatically active.\r"

A collaborative study by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was conducted to determine the effect of dialyzer disinfectants on five types of dialyzer membranes: three cellulosic (Cuprophan, cellulose acetate, cuprammonium rayon); and two synthetic (polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile). The disinfectants tested were: 4% formaldehyde; Renalin; Cidex Dialyzer; Sporicidin HO; Warexin; and RenNew-D. Water was the control. Dialyzers were reprocessed up to 15 times. Each reprocessing consisted of rinsing, air-leak testing, filling with fresh disinfectant, and storing for 2 to 4 days. After 15 reprocessings or air-leak failure, each dialyzer was microbiologically challenged for membrane integrity. Membranes exposed to Renalin, Cidex Dialyzer, and water passed all tests. Cellulosic membranes exposed to Warexin failed all tests after 2 to 9 reprocessings. Cellulose acetate membranes exposed to Sporicidin HD failed microbiologic testing. One polysulfone dialyzer exposed to RenNew-D and one exposed to 4% formaldehyde failed microbiologic testing. These results and those obtained from epidemiologic studies suggest that membrane integrity testing (e.g. an air-leak test) should be an integral part of dialyzer reprocessing.\r"

During HD, the prolongation of celite activated coagulation time (CCT) of the intracorporeal blood was significantly milder in FUT than in heparin and that of blood passing through the dialyzer was increased in FUT compared with LH. FUT showed no prolongation of CCT after HD. These results indicate that FUT is a more useful and safer anticoagulant for HD patients with hemorrhagic complications than any regional anticoagulating method using heparin (RH or LH).\r"

  ".W": "Beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2m) plasma levels during hemodialysis have recently been considered markers of membrane biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to assess if generation of beta 2m from blood cells in contact with the membrane could account for changes in beta 2m plasma concentration during hemodialysis. The role of heparin was studied as well by comparing conventional with heparin-free dialysis. beta 2m plasma levels were measured in six patients during 12 Cuprophan (Cu) and 12 Eval (E) non-consecutive hemodialysis sessions without ultrafiltration. E membranes were compared with and without heparin. beta 2m plasma levels significantly increased with Cu but not with E. A total of 200 ml of blood from four other patients was recirculated ex vivo before Cu hemodialysis in Cu or E and then reinfused into the patient. A drop in beta 2m concentration was observed in the recirculating blood, recovery of beta 2m from the washed filter was higher with E, and reinfusion of recirculated blood to the patient was not associated with significant increases in beta 2m plasma levels. Hemodialysis with a new Cu filter, following reinfusion, did not produce significant increase in plasma beta 2m concentration. In conclusion, 1) beta 2m plasma levels change during Cu, but are not associated with hemoconcentration from ultrafiltration nor with local release from the blood leaving the filter, 2) beta 2m binding to the membrane may account for decreased levels in recirculated blood, 3) E membranes both with and without heparin do not increase beta 2m plasma levels and reinfusion of recirculated blood blunts the beta 2m changes observed with Cu.\r"

Novel beta 2m had a lower molecular weight and a higher acidic isoelectric point. The serum levels of beta 2m might be dependent on the dialysis duration. Changes of conformation or amino acid composition in native beta 2m might occur in patients with chronic renal failure, and these changes may begin prior to the initiation of dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism(s) behind the larger relative increase of Plasma beta 2 microglobulin (P-beta 2m) than that of Plasma albumin (P-alb) during Cuprophan hemodialysis is disputed. To elucidate this phenomenon P-alb, P-beta 2m (MW 11,800) and Plasma cystatin (P-cC; MW 13,000) an inhibitor of cystein proteinases, were determined before and after a Cuprophan or polysulphone hemodialysis (4-7 hr, QB 200 ml/min) in 30 stable regular dialysis treatment (RDT) patients. Body weight (BW) decreased by 2.5 +/- 1.4% (mean +/- SD). P-alb, P-beta 2m and P-cC increased by 11.4 +/- 14.8%, 15.4 +/- 11.5%, and 22.1 +/- 14.3%, respectively, during Cuprophan dialysis. The relative increase of P-cC was larger than that of P-beta 2m (P less than 0.05) and that of P-alb (P less than 0.02). During polysulphone dialysis BW decreased by 4.1 +/- 1.8%. P-alb, P-beta 2m, and P-cC increased almost equally by 28.1 +/- 18, 26.5 +/- 19.2, and 26.8 +/- 14.4%, respectively. These results are hard to interpret. Is the increase in P-cC a new marker of biocompatibility or does it reflect the true shift of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins between the interstitial and the plasma volume during hemodialysis better than P-beta 2m? In vitro studies indicate that small amounts of both Serum beta 2m (S-beta 2m) and Serum cystatin C (S-cC) are adsorbed to or sieved through the Cuprophan membrane, findings which render the kinetics of LMW proteins during hemodialysis still more complex.\r"

Four of ten livers displayed good function, with bile excreted immediately after revascularization, and animal survival for over 24 hr.

Although heart muscle damage was one of the disadvantages with the original epicardial assist devices, as long as no bleeding occurs, such trauma would be of secondary importance in this particular application. The development of the proposed epicardial circulatory assist device (ECAD) was evolutionary in nature, with the second prototype design based on the lessons learned from that of the first. In vivo results from both phases of the project are reported. ECAD prototype 1 (ECAD-1) was composed of a flexible outer housing and two driving balloons. Fixation to the heart was adjustable for various heart sizes using Velcro fasteners. The design of the ECAD prototype 2 (ECAD-2) was based on the results of ECAD-1. Fixation to the heart was accomplished by suturing the outer housing onto the heart along the anterior descending artery and at the posterior atrioventricular groove. Each device was tested in five dogs. ECAD-1 was able to maintain the systemic circulation for 5 hours. However, unstable fixation and myocardial damage due to rubbing were the major problems. ECAD-2 passive effects on natural heart filling were acceptable. Under conditions of severe heart failure, a flow of more than 85% of control was obtained with a driving rate of 90-110 beats/min and 30% systole. The longest pumping was conducted for 8 hours. The ECAD was demonstrated to be a device useful in assisting the failing heart for short periods. Proper design will play a fundamental role in successful extended use.\r"

The increase in ESRD between 1960 and 1981 was 67%. Of this increase, 30% resulted from an increase in the population and 37% from an apparent increase in the incidence of ESRD. Transplant rate, as a percentage of patients accepted onto dialysis, has decreased because the number of patients on dialysis is increasing faster than available transplant kidney grafts. Almost all patients who are currently not accepted are older than the age of 60, and if they are accepted they will have a much shorter survival time than the present dialysis patient population. Although acceptance rate, as incidence per year, will probably continue to increase significantly, the prevalence figures of patients on chronic dialysis will probably increase less fast, as the patients will have shorter survival times. This overall shortening of survival time will probably be further shortened as transplanters increasingly transplant the younger patients who would have the longest survival times on dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "Six patients accepted into a cardiac transplantation program have been supported with a Biomedicus LVAD. Five of the six patients deteriorated while awaiting a donor organ; the sixth was being supported with a device following mitral valve surgery and showed no recovery of ventricular function. In all cases the device was used only after all other therapeutic modalities had failed. The periods of support ranged from 2.5 to 31 days, mean of 10 days. Three patients underwent cardiac transplantation and all three have been discharged and are well. The three survivors were supported for 2.5, 3, and 31 days. Three deaths occurred in the patients supported for 5, 9, and 15 days, the causes being sepsis, massive cerebral embolism, and respiratory failure. Patients were for the most part maintained with some degree of heparinization, and hemolysis was a significant problem in only one patient and associated with a very small arterial return cannula. Flows were routinely maintained above 2.4 L/min/m2, and all showed recovery of other organ functions while being supported. The patient supported for 31 days was capable of limited mobilization by use of the removable drive system. The Biomedicus LVAD represents a relatively inexpensive support modality for patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.\r"

Thirteen adult and one pediatric patients were supported postcardiotomy, 10 LVAD, 3 BIVAD, and 1 RVAD. There were no equipment failures over a mean perfusion time of 52 hr (range 12-140 hr). Seven of thirteen adult patients were supported and weaned from 6 LVAD and 1 BIVAD. Three patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation, and the other four recovered ventricular function, of whom five are longterm survivors at a mean followup time of 16 months. In one patient bridged to transplantation, a prior infection caused the patient to succumb after successful transplantation. All patients assisted for transplantation are carefully screened, and would be excluded from transplantation if they developed significant infection, or irreversible renal or neurologic limitations.\r"

  ".W": "Techniques of filtration with high flux dialysis membranes are capable of easily removing beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2-M) (MW: 11,800) from renal failure patients. However, hemodialysis is preferred as a method of removing beta-2-M in terms of cost and operation. The present study elucidates the permeability characteristics for beta-2-M of newly developed cellulosic and synthetic polymer membranes for hemodialysis to determine the diffusive clearance for beta-2-M. The authors did dialysis experiments with 3H-labeled water and 125I-labeled beta-2-M to obtain the solute permeability of cellulosic and synthetic polymer membranes. Radioactivity of a single hollow fiber after dialysis experiments for predetermined periods was measured in a gamma counter. Through analysis of radioactivity data, they obtained solute permeability data, from which diffusive clearance for beta-2-M was calculated. With wet cellulose triacetate membranes, values for inside diameter, wall thickness, and water content were 205 +/- 10 microns (N = 100), 12.4 +/- 1.5 microns (N = 200), and 78 vol%, respectively. The cellulose triacetate membranes had a solute permeability for beta-2-M of (4.12 +/- 1.83) x 10(-5) cm/sec (N = 25) and a pure water permeability of 60 ml/m2/hr/mmHg. Diffusive clearance for beta-2-M was calculated to be 39 ml/min at a plasma flow rate of 160 ml/min and a dialysate flow rate of 500 ml/min. The diffuse clearance of capillary dialyzers composed of regenerated cellulose and synthetic polymer membranes ranged from 23 to 19 ml/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
