  ".W": "We investigated the effect of increasing hemoglobin- (Hb) O2 affinity on muscle maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) while muscle blood flow, [Hb], HbO2 saturation, and thus O2 delivery (muscle blood flow X arterial O2 content) to the working muscle were kept unchanged from control. VO2max was measured in isolated in situ canine gastrocnemius working maximally (isometric tetanic contractions). The muscles were pump perfused, in alternating order, with either normal blood [O2 half-saturation pressure of hemoglobin (P50) = 32.1 +/- 0.5 (SE) Torr] or blood from dogs that had been fed sodium cyanate (150 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 3-4 wk (P50 = 23.2 +/- 0.9). In both conditions (n = 8) arterial PO2 was set at approximately 200 Torr to fully saturate arterial blood, which thereby produced the same arterial O2 contents, and muscle blood flow was set at 106 ml.100 g-1.min-1, so that O2 delivery in both conditions was the same. VO2max was 11.8 +/- 1.0 ml.min-1.100 g-1 when perfused with the normal blood (control) and was reduced by 17% to 9.8 +/- 0.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 when perfused with the low-P50 blood (P less than 0.01). Mean muscle effluent venous PO2 was also significantly less (26 +/- 3 vs. 30 +/- 2 Torr; P less than 0.01) in the low-P50 condition, as was an estimate of the capillary driving pressure for O2 diffusion, the mean capillary PO2 (45 +/- 3 vs. 51 +/- 2 Torr). However, the estimated muscle O2 diffusing capacity was not different between conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Surface area of the diaphragm, diaphragm weight, and body weight were also determined. Diaphragm surface area and weight varied linearly with body weight, but there was no significant correlation between overall diaphragm thickness and body weight. Diaphragm thickness varied significantly between regions, and three regions had systematic left-to-right differences as well. Because diaphragm geometry influences the diaphragm's function as a pressure generator, regional differences in thickness may alter the relationship between the force developed by the activation of a particular region of the diaphragm and its action on the respiratory system.\r"

Data were obtained from steady-state temperatures measured in the forearm after 3 h of immersion in water at temperatures (Tw) of 15 (n = 6), 20 (n = 5), and 30 degrees C (n = 5). Temperatures were measured every 0.5 cm from the longitudinal axis of the forearm to the skin approximately 9 cm distal from the elbow. Heat flux was measured at two sites on the skin adjacent to the temperature probe. The FE model is comprised of concentric annular compartments with boundaries defined by the location of temperature measurements. Through this approach, it was possible to include both the metabolic heat production and the convective heat transfer between blood and tissue at two levels of blood flow, one perfusing the compartment and the other passing through the compartment. Without heat exchange at the passing blood flow level, the arterial blood temperature would be assumed to have a constant value everywhere in the forearm muscles, leading to a solution of the bioheat equation that greatly underpredicts keff. The extent of convective heat exchange at the passing blood flow level is estimated to be approximately 60% of the total heat exchange between blood and tissue. Concurrent with this heat exchange is a decrease in the temperature of the arterial blood as it flows radially from the axis to the skin of the forearm, and this decrease is enhanced with a lowered Tw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tissue temperature (Tt) was continuously monitored by a calibrated multicouple probe during a 3-h immersion of the resting forearm. Tt was measured every 5 mm from the longitudinal axis of the forearm (determined from computed-tomography scanning) to the skin surface. Skin temperature (Tsk), heat loss (Hsk), and blood flow (Q) of the forearm, as well as rectal temperature (Tre) and arterial blood temperature at the brachial artery (Tbla), were measured during the experiments. When the keff values were calculated from the finite-element (FE) solution of the bioheat equation, keff skin + fat ranged from 0.28 +/- 0.03 to 0.73 +/- 0.14 W.degrees C-1.m-1 and keff muscle varied between 0.56 +/- 0.05 and 1.91 +/- 0.19 W.degrees C-1.m-1 from 15 to 36 degrees C. The values of keff skin + fat and keff muscle, calculated from the FE solution for Tw less than or equal to 30 degrees C, were not different from the average in vitro values obtained from the literature. The keff values of the forearm tissues were linearly related (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) to Q for Tw greater than or equal to 30 degrees C. It was found that the muscle tissue could account for 92 +/- 1% of the total forearm insulation during immersion in water between 15 and 36 degrees C.\r"

At 110 days of age aortic constriction or sham operations were performed, and hearts were studied 28 days later. Aortic constriction increased left ventricular (LV) mass by 40% over the control value of 611 +/- 27 mg; this adaptive response was not altered by CO exposure. Aortic constriction and CO exposure increased right ventricular (RV) mass by 10 and 11%, respectively, over the control value of 185 +/- 10 mg. The effects of both experimental procedures on RV mass were additive (23%). Peak LV pressure development (dP/dtmax) in vitro increased 29% after aortic constriction in the nonexposed rats. CO exposure blunted the increase in peak LV systolic pressure due to aortic constriction. Maximum positive and negative dP/dtmax decreased by 19% after aortic constriction and were unaffected by CO exposure. The percentage of alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) in the ventricles was 94 +/- 2% in the control group and was decreased to 81 +/- 3% by aortic constriction. In contrast, the percentage of alpha-MHC was 87 +/- 2% for CO-exposed rats and was not significantly altered after aortic constriction. In vitro coronary flow was increased 18% in hearts of adult rats exposed to CO as neonates. Exposure of neonatal rats to CO induced chronic adaptations in the myocardium, some of which became evident in adulthood only when hearts were challenged by aortic constriction.\r"

  ".U": "91358224\r", 
  ".W": "In the process of estimating the kinetic parameters of the pulmonary endothelial serotonin (5-HT) uptake, it is critically important to distinguish the effects of hemodynamic changes from endothelial injury. Therefore, the effects of changes in flow rate (1.7-5.0 ml/s), hemodynamics (vasoconstriction by norepinephrine), and temperature (39 vs. 33 degrees C) were investigated in isolated rabbit lungs. Indicator-dilution data were expressed in terms of the Michaelis-Menten equation for the two 5-HT uptake pathways in the preparation. The maximum uptake velocity (Vmax1) and the 5-HT concentration at half-maximum velocity (Km1) of the first pathway as well as the first-order constant (Vmax2/Km2) of the linear part of the second pathway were determined. Neither vasoconstriction nor flow variations had any effect on Km1, whereas increasing the flow rate caused extensive recruitment, with a concomitant increase in Vmax1 and Vmax2/Km2. Furthermore, all the kinetic parameters were significantly decreased at the lower temperature. We conclude that Km1 is independent of organ hemodynamics (vasoconstriction and flow) but susceptible to changes in 5-HT uptake capacity caused by a change in temperature. Vmax1 and Vmax2/Km2 respond to alterations in 5-HT uptake capacity and perfused organ volume. These are prerequisites to apply kinetic modeling as a method for the investigation of pulmonary endothelial function and integrity.\r"

We used finite-element analysis based on anatomic and mechanical measurements in dogs to assess the action of the intercostal and other rib cage muscles in a model of an isolated canine rib cage. When intercostal muscle forces of either the internal or the external layer were applied in a single interspace, they pulled the adjacent ribs together, consistent with published observations in dogs. However, when the forces were applied in all interspaces, the external layer caused an inspiratory motion and the internal layer caused an expiratory motion, consistent with conventional understanding of intercostal muscle actions. Parasternal intercostal, levator costae, and transversus thoracis (triangularis sterni) muscle actions were also simulated. These muscles caused expected movements of the ribs and sternum. We conclude that the actions of intercostal muscles depend on the spatial extent of their activation. Their actions in a single interspace and in multiple interspaces can be observed and explained with three-dimensional finite-element models.\r"

We measured interrupter resistance (Rint,rs), which in humans represents airway resistance, the additional resistance (delta Rrs) due to viscoelastic pressure dissipations and time constant inequalities, and static (Est,rs) and dynamic (Edyn,rs) elastance. The results were compared with a previous study on 16 normal anesthetized paralyzed humans (D'Angelo et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 2556-2564, 1989). We observed that 1) resistance and elastance were higher in ARDS patients; 2) with increasing V, Rint,rs and Est,rs did not change, delta Rrs decreased progressively, and Edyn,rs increased progressively; 3) with increasing delta V, Rint,rs decreased slightly, delta Rrs increased progressively, and Est,rs and Edyn,rs showed an initial decrease followed by a secondary increase noted only in the ARDS patients. The above findings could be explained in terms of a model incorporating a standard resistance in parallel with a standard elastance and a series spring-and-dashpot body that represents the stress adaptation units within the tissues of the respiratory system.\r"

We gave phosphoramidon to inhibit NEP and enalapril maleate or captopril to inhibit ACE. Animals pretreated with inhaled phosphoramidon (7.5 or 75 nmol), enalapril maleate (87 or 870 nmol), or captopril (350 nmol) reached higher peak lung resistance (RL) values (14.3 +/- 2.7, 15.7 +/- 3.8, 16.7 +/- 3.8, 11.4 +/- 1.6, and 24.6 +/- 3.5 cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively) than saline-treated animals (5.9 +/- 1.1; P less than 0.05) after bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (5 Hz, 10 V, 10 ms, 150 s). Intravenous phosphoramidon (1 mg/kg), but not intravenous captopril (6 mg/kg), potentiated peak RL (22.9 +/- 6.9 and 7.1 +/- 1.5 cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively). Vagal nerve stimulation (1 and 5 Hz) increased the extravasation of Evans blue dye in tracheobronchial tissues compared with sham-stimulated animals, but this was not potentiated by inhaled enzyme inhibitors or intravenous captopril. However, intravenous phosphoramidon significantly augmented the extravasation of Evans blue dye in main bronchi and intrapulmonary airways. We conclude that degradative enzymes regulate both NANC-induced airflow obstruction and airway microvascular leakage.\r"

We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls. The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth. During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations. Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate. Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz). This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring. At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring.\r"

Laryngeal stimulation is known to induce apnea in newborn animals, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this effect are not known. Intracellular recording of ventral respiratory group neurons was accomplished in intact anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated piglets. Apnea was induced by insufflation of the larynx with ammonia-saturated air, smoke, or water. Laryngeal insufflation induced phrenic nerve apnea, stimulation of postinspiratory neurons, and stable membrane potentials in inspiratory and expiratory cells consistent with postinspiratory inhibition. Usually the membrane potential of each neuronal type cycled through an expiratory level before onset of the first recovery breath. Variants of the apnea response, probably reflecting the aspiration reflex or sniffing, sneezing, coughing, and swallowing, were also observed. These latter patterns showed oscillation between inspiration and postinspiration without an apparent intervening stage II expiratory phase. However, stage II expiratory activity always preceded onset of the first ramp inspiration after such a pattern. These findings suggest that activation of postinspiratory mechanisms causes profound alterations in the respiratory pattern and that stage II expiration importantly modulates recovery of ramp inspiratory activity. The mechanism of this latter effect may be inhibition of early inspiratory neurons with consequent postinhibitory rebound.\r"

In 10 experiments we established isolated perfused rat lung preparations. The lungs were initially isogravimetric at 10 cmH2O arterial pressure, 2 cmH2O venous pressure, and 5 cmH2O alveolar pressure. Perialveolar interstitial pressure was determined by micropuncture at alveolar junctions by use of the servo-null technique. Simultaneously a second micropipette was placed in an alveolar junction 20-40 microns away, and a bolus of albumin solution (3.5 g/100 ml) was injected. The resulting pressure transient was recorded for injection durations of 1 and 4 s in nonedematous lungs. The measurements were repeated after gross edema formation induced by elevated perfusion pressure. We model the interstitium as a homogeneous linearly poroelastic material and assume the initial pressure distribution due to the injection to be Gaussian. The pressure decay is inversely proportional to time, with time constant T, where T is a measure of the ratio of interstitial tissue stiffness to interstitial resistance to fluid flow. A linear regression was performed on the reciprocal of the pressure for the decaying portion of the transients to determine T. Comparing pressure transients in nonedematous and edematous lungs, we found that T was 4.0 +/- 1.4 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 s, respectively. We have shown that fluid transport through the pulmonary interstitium on a local level is sensitive to changes in interstitial stiffness and resistance. These results are consistent with the decreased stiffness and resistance in the perialveolar interstitium that accompany increased hydration.\r"

Six male volunteers exercised on a cycle ergometer at 20 degrees C (relative humidity = 30%) as exercise intensity was increased stepwise until voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples were collected at exercise intensities of 29, 56, 70, and 95% of maximum aerobic power (VO2max). A curvilinear relationship between exercise intensity and Na+ concentration in plasma ([Na+]p) was observed. [Na+]p significantly increased at 70% VO2max and at 95% VO2max was approximately 8 meq/kgH2O higher than control. The change in lactate concentration in plasma ([Lac-]p) was closely correlated with the change in [Na+]p (delta[Na+]p = 0.687 delta[Lac-]p + 1.79, r = 0.99). The change in [Lac-]p was also inversely correlated with the change in HCO3- concentration in plasma (delta[HCO3-]p = -0.761 delta[Lac-]p + 0.22, r = -1.00). At an exercise intensity of 95% VO2max, 60% of the increase in plasma osmolality (Posmol) was accounted for by an increase in [Na+]p. These results suggest that lactic acid released into the vascular space from active skeletal muscles reacts with [HCO3-]p to produce CO2 gas and Lac-. The data raise the intriguing notion that increase in [Na+]p during exercise may be caused by elevated Lac-.\r"

The number of gram-positive bacterial species isolated from skin after CG preparation was dramatically reduced. The gram-positive bacterial contamination rate dropped from 12.1% to 2.2% of donor body areas, a drop of 82%. With CG, 12 of the 15 contaminant species were eliminated; and we saw a general reduction in the total number of contaminated body areas, a specific and pronounced reduction in gram-positive bacteria, and an increase from 86.3% to 94.4% in the amount of skin obtained from donor cadavers that tested negative for bacterial contamination.\r"

This study, for the period 1984 through 1988, evaluated the use of the helicopter for transportation of acute-condition patients with burns to a regional burn center for a rural area. It is concluded that helicopter transport within a 180-mile radius in a non-hospital-based system is not appreciably faster than is ambulance transport, and does not clinically benefit most burned patients. Consideration such as safety, cost, and working space are discussed. It is recommended that at least one of three criteria be met before helicopter transfer is considered for patients with burns: the surface area involved should be enough to require a formal fluid resuscitation, an inhalation injury should be present or suspected, or there should be a possible need for an escharotomy.\r"

The local fasciocutaneous flap is advocated as a simple, rapidly elevated, single-staged option that preserves function while correcting these deformities. Although the dorsal thoracic fascial flaps are the most versatile in the axillary region, if they are unavailable or unsuitable, other unspecified but equally robust alternatives from the upper arm or anterolateral chest are similarly efficacious.\r"

Unfortunately, one fourth of the centers still do not deal with emotional aspects of burns in their discharge programs. For program delivery, videotape is becoming an increasingly accepted teaching method. Eighty-five percent of burn facilities experienced barriers to patient education at discharge, with more than half reporting three or more difficulties. The most common difficulty was time constraints (50%), followed by language and sociocultural barriers (41%), lack of receptivity by clientele (39%), lack of educational materials and planning (26%), and inadequate funding (25%). Some of these problems might be alleviated by the establishment of a clearinghouse for burn educational materials.\r"

The BTE Work Simulator has four major components: the exercise head to provide variable resistance, tools that attach to the exercise head, a control console containing a microprocessor that calculates work and power, and the Quest software package (Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment Co.). Quest provides four static/isometric and seven dynamic/isotonic tests that can be used to document the extent of a patient's impairment. In addition, it has daily treatment options and acts as an extensive data base capable of retrieving any stored test or treatment results. This software system greatly facilitates the use of the BTE Work Simulator by providing instant calculations of power and coefficients of variation, immediate patient feedback, graphic expansion of the data, and printed evaluation reports.\r"

Treatment of hypertrophic burn scar consists of several surgical options and of pressure therapy, which traditionally involves wearing garments made from elasticized fabric. This article reviews the treatment of hypertrophic scar tissue, with emphasis on its history and on nonsurgical methods of managing the burn scar.\r"

We reviewed the records of 26 patients with hypertrophic scarring to the central portion of the face to assess the effectiveness of the insert. Seventeen (65%) of these patients wore the insert until scar maturation. Three of these 17 patients later required reconstructive surgery of the central face. Our findings suggest that pressure to this part of the face may be effective in decreasing hypertrophic scar formation. The insert described in this article is inexpensive and relatively easy to fabricate.\r"

Twenty-three of these research questions concerned issues of wound care or infection control. This group of questions was further analyzed to determine priority research issues. The five most highly ranked questions in the category of wound care/infection control with regard to impact on patient welfare concerned healing of donor sites and skin grafts, wound cleansing, and the effect of pressure garments on wound healing. Similarly, the five most highly ranked questions with regard to impact on the profession of burn nursing concerned the impact of combining patients with burns and patients without burns in the same unit, healing of donor sites and skin grafts, care of the patient with burns who also has acquired immune deficiency syndrome, infection control, and dressing of the burn wound.\r"

However, little is known about its protein backbone structure and hence its role in diseases such as colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, and cystic fibrosis, which are known to have mucin abnormalities. Studies in this manuscript show that MUC-2 contains two distinct regions with a high degree of internal homology, but the two regions bear no significant homology to each other. Region 1 consists mostly of 48-bp repeats which are interrupted in places by 21-24-bp segments. Several of these interrupting sequences show similarity to each other, creating larger composite repeat units. Region 1 has no length polymorphisms. Region 2 is composed of 69-bp tandem repeats arranged in an uninterrupted array of up to 115 individual units. Southern analysis of genomic DNA samples using TaqI and HinfI reveals both length and sequence polymorphisms which occur within region 2. The sequence polymorphisms have different ethnic distributions, while the length polymorphisms are due to variable numbers of tandem repeats.\r"

  ".W": "Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury, but it is unclear how they exert their deleterious effects on cellular metabolism. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that free radicals elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inhibit glycolysis as part of their mechanism of injury. We tested these ideas directly in hearts subjected to hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts before, during, and after 4 min of perfusion with H2O2 (0.75 mM) and Fe(3+)-chelate (0.1 mM). Isovolumic left ventricular pressure exhibited progressive functional deterioration and contracture after exposure to H2O2 + Fe3+. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed partial ATP depletion and sugar phosphate accumulation indicative of glycolytic inhibition. To measure [Ca2+]i, fluorine NMR spectra were acquired in a separate group of hearts loaded with the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA [5,5'-difluoro derivative of 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid]. Mean time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased from 347 +/- 14 nM in control to 1,026 +/- 295 nM 4 min after free radical generation (means +/- SEM, n = 7), and remained elevated thereafter. We conclude that free radicals induce clear-cut, specific derangements of cellular metabolism in the form of glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload. The observed increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that the deleterious effects of free radicals are at least partially mediated by secondary changes in cellular calcium homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) in Mennonites is associated with homozygosity for a T to A transversion in the E1 alpha gene of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This causes a tyrosine to asparagine substitution at position 393 (Y393N). To assess the functional significance of this missense mutation, we have carried out transfection studies using E1 alpha-deficient MSUD lymphoblasts (Lo) as a host. The level of E1 beta subunit is also greatly reduced in Lo cells. Efficient episomal expression in lymphoblasts was achieved using the EBO vector. The inserts employed were chimeric bovine-human cDNAs which encode mitochondrial import competent E1 alpha subunit precursors. Transfection with normal E1 alpha cDNA into Lo cells restored decarboxylation activity of intact cells. Western blotting showed that both E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits were markedly increased. Introduction of Y393N mutant E1 alpha cDNA failed to produce any measurable decarboxylation activity. Mutant E1 alpha subunit was expressed at a normal level, however, the E1 beta subunit was undetectable. These results provide the first evidence that Y393N mutation is the cause of MSUD. Moreover, this mutation impedes the assembly of E1 alpha with E1 beta into a stable alpha 2 beta 2 structure, resulting in the degradation of the free E1 beta subunit.\r"

  ".W": "The Tax oncoprotein of the type I human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) activates transcription of cellular and viral genes through at least two different transcription factor pathways. Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins. Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins. We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation. Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics. These results suggest that transcriptional activation through the CREB/ATF pathway may play an important role in Tax-mediated cellular transformation.\r"

We have used in situ hybridization and an immunoassay to determine whether granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (a cytokine capable of eosinophil activation) is present in the airway of asthmatics (n = 6) who have 37.0 +/- 15.1% airway eosinophilia after endobronchial allergen challenge. Levels of immunoreactive GM-CSF (less than 4 pg/ml pre-allergen versus 180.5 +/- 46.9 pg/ml post-allergen) increased significantly 24 h after endobronchial allergen stimulation. The cellular source of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GM-CSF, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining, was derived predominantly from UCHL-1 positive BAL lymphocytes, as well as from a smaller population of alveolar macrophages. Before local endobronchial allergen challenge, less than 1% of lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages recovered by BAL expressed GM-CSF mRNA, whereas after allergen stimulation 92.6 +/- 3.4% of lymphocytes and 17.5 +/- 22.7% of alveolar macrophages expressed GM-CSF mRNA. This study provides evidence that in an experimental model of allergen-induced asthma, activation of the immune and inflammatory response (BAL lymphocyte and alveolar macrophage production of GM-CSF) is temporally associated with an inflammatory cell influx of eosinophils into the airway.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxia in vivo is associated with constriction of the distal vasculature in the lung. Uniquely situated at the interface between blood and the vessel wall proper, the vascular endothelium may release vasoactive mediators in the setting of hypoxia. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor released by endothelial cells that could function as a paracrine regulator of vascular tone. We found that physiologic low oxygen tension (PO2 = 30 Torr) increased endothelin secretion from cultured human endothelial cells four to eightfold above the secretion rate at ambient oxygen tension. This increase in secretion was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the transcriptional rate of the preproendothelin gene resulting in increased steady-state mRNA levels of preproendothelin. In contrast, the transcription of a number of other growth-factor-encoding genes, including transforming growth factor-beta, was unaffected by hypoxia. Endothelin transcript production increased within 1 h of hypoxia and persisted for at least 48 h. In addition, the stimulatory effects of low oxygen tension on endothelin mRNA levels were reversible upon reexposure to 21% oxygen environments. These findings suggest a role for endothelin in the control of regional blood flow in the vasculature in response to changes in oxygen tension.\r"

  ".W": "Previous data suggested an active Cl- conductance in the renal proximal convoluted tubule, although single channel conductance and regulation were not found. We have investigated the presence and regulation of the Cl- channel in proximal convoluted tubules by patch clamp analysis. The current-voltage relationship of whole cells with 130 mM NaCl in the pipette was nonlinear. The addition of 1-34 PTH (10(-8) M), forskolin, or cAMP significantly increased whole cell Cl- conductance. We found a single Cl- channel in excised apical membranes possessing conductance of 33 picosiemens (pS) at positive and 22.5 pS at negative potential, which was blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'- disulfonic acid (10(-4) M) and was selective to Cl- (Cl/Na = 10). The channel was activated by prolonged membrane depolarization, by a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), or by purified kinase C (PKC), but not by Ca2+ (1 microM) inside the membrane. During cell-attached patch clamping, the channel was similarly activated by PTH, phorbol ester, or dibutyryl cAMP in a dose-dependent manner. To investigate second messenger contributions to the PTH-action, the PTH-evoked channels were modified further by the subsequent addition of several blockers of the second messengers. This suggested that PKA and PKC were involved in Cl- channel activation. We therefore conclude that renal proximal convoluted tubule cells possess an apical Cl- channel activated by PTH via the PKA and PKC pathways.\r"

The molecular basis of this disorder is heterogeneous and mutations in codons 28, 46, 48, and 49 (codons 22, 40, 42, and 43 in the previous nomenclature which did not include the six NH2-terminal amino acids) have been reported. In this study we present data on seven unrelated HE Sp alpha I/74 kindred from diverse racial backgrounds in whom we identified four different mutations all occurring in exon 2 of alpha Sp at codon 28. Utilizing the polymerase chain reaction we established a CGT----CTT; Arg----Leu 28 mutation in one kindred of Arab/Druze origin. In two unrelated white kindred of English/European origin the substitution is CGT----AGT; Arg----Ser 28 and in two apparently unrelated white kindred from New Zealand, the mutation is CGT----TGT; Arg----Cys 28. Finally, in one American black kindred and in a black kindred from Ghana the mutation involves CGT----CAT; Arg----His 28. Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed that the probands are heterozygous for the respective mutant alleles. All four point mutations abolished an Aha II restriction enzyme site which allowed verification of linkage of the mutation with HE Sp alpha I/74. Our results imply that codon 28 of alpha Sp is a \"hot spot\" for mutations and also indicate that Arg 28 is critical for the conformational stability and functional self association of Sp heterodimers.\r"

DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified monocyte C1INH mRNA revealed normal and mutant transcripts, as expected in this disorder that occurs in heterozygous individuals. Single base mutations near the 3' end of the coding sequence were identified in affected members of each family. One mutation consisted of insertion of an adenosine at position 1304 which created a premature termination codon (TAA), whereas the second consisted of deletion of the thymidine at position 1298 which created a premature termination codon (TGA) 23 nucleotides downstream. These mutations are approximately 250 nucleotides upstream of the natural termination codon. Nuclear run-off experiments in one kindred revealed no difference in transcription rates of the C1INH gene between the patients and normals. C1INH mRNA half-life experiments were not technically feasible because of the prolonged half-life of the normal transcript. Dideoxynucleotide primer extension experiments allowed the differentiation of the normal and mutant transcripts. These studies showed that the mutant transcript was not decreased relative to the normal, and this therefore was at least partially responsible for the C1INH mRNA elevation. This elevation may be due to the decreased catabolism of the mutant transcript.\r"

To determine the role of these factors in the mediation of glucagon suppression, we injected alloxan while clamping the arterial supply of the pancreatic splenic lobe of dogs, thus inducing insulin deficiency localized to the ventral lobe and avoiding hyperglycemia. Ventral lobe insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin outputs were then measured in response to a stepped IV glucose infusion. In control dogs glucagon suppression occurred at a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and somatostatin output increased at glucose greater than 250 mg/dl. In alloxan-treated dogs glucagon output was not suppressed nor did somatostatin output increase. We concluded that insulin was required in the mediation of glucagon suppression and somatostatin stimulation. Subsequently, we infused insulin at high rates directly into the artery that supplied the beta cell-deficient lobe in six alloxan-treated dogs. Insulin infusion alone did not cause suppression of glucagon or stimulation of somatostatin; however, insulin repletion during glucose infusions did restore the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress glucagon and stimulate somatostatin. We conclude that intra-islet insulin permits glucose to suppress glucagon secretion and stimulate somatostatin during hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".U": "91358734\r", 
  ".W": "Renal cortical tubules consist of polarized epithelial cells where Na/H antiport activity has been demonstrated on the apical and/or basolateral membrane. Apical Na/H antiport activity plays an important role in transcellular bicarbonate (HCO3-) reabsorption, whereas basolateral Na/H antiport activity could be involved in transcellular HCO3- secretion as well as cell volume and pH control. To determine whether this heterogeneity in both localization and function is due to the existence of more than one Na/H antiporter, we studied the tissue distribution of Na/H antiporter mRNA by use of reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in isolated nephron segments from rat renal cortex. The primers used were directed against the rat renal cortical Na/H antiporter cDNA which is homologous to the human growth factor-activatable Na/H antiporter. RT/PCR of beta-actin mRNA were performed as positive controls. Na/H antiporter mRNA expression in the proximal tubule was not detectable in S1 and S2 segments from superficial and most midcortical nephrons, which exhibit exclusively luminal Na/H antiport activity. It was expressed in S1 and S2 segments from juxtamedullary nephrons which have also basolateral Na/H antiport activity. Beta-actin mRNA was expressed uniformly in all segments of the proximal tubule. Na/H antiporter mRNA was also expressed in cortical thick ascending limb and cortical collecting duct, segments with basolateral Na/H antiport activity as well as in the glomeruli. In conclusion, at least two different Na/H antiporters exist in the renal cortex, i.e., the proximal tubule. The close correlation between functional localization of basolateral Na/H antiport activity and mRNA expression suggests that the rat kidney Na/H antiporter DNA homologous to the human growth factor activatable Na/H antiporter encodes a basolateral exchanger. The observed expression in a minority of midcortical proximal tubules could reflect a certain heterogeneity in these nephron segments.\r"

In 13 cases of early erythroid leukemias, we investigated whether erythropoietin (Epo) autocrine stimulation was responsible for the growth factor autonomy. Epo transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in cells from one patient. These cells also expressed an Epo receptor (1,000 receptors per cell) with a 420-pM affinity and Epo was detected in the supernatant of cultured cells. In 8 of the 13 cases, Epo transcripts were revealed by the polymerase chain reaction ranging from 0.5 to 500 copies per cell. In situ hybridization proved that these Epo transcripts were present in the blast cells. No Epo gene abnormalities were detected by Southern blotting. In two cases, leukemic cells were grown in the presence of Epo-neutralizing antibodies or Epo antisense oligomers. In one case, the antibody significantly reduced autonomous growth. In contrast, the antibody had no effect in the second case in which blast cells transcribed the Epo gene at a low level. However, Epo antisense oligomers partially inhibited autonomous growth. This inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous Epo. Overall, these results suggest that an extracellular or intracellular autocrine Epo stimulation occurs in some cases of erythroid malignancies.\r"

MBP has been localized on damaged helminths and tissues in hypersensitivity diseases including bronchial asthma. The MBP cDNA indicates that MBP is translated as a slightly acidic preproprotein with an acidic propart. To test the hypothesis that the acidic pro-part of proMBP inhibits the toxicity of mature MBP, acidic polyamino acids (aa) were used as antagonists of MBP toxicity to K562 cells and guinea pig tracheal epithelium and used as antagonists of MBP airway hyperresponsiveness in primates. The acidic poly aa inhibited MBP toxicity and MBP airway hyperresposiveness. The acidic poly aa inhibited MBP toxicity in a charge-dependent manner similar to that proposed for proMBP, suggesting that the acidic pro-part of proMBP functions to mask mature MBP toxicity. This inhibition was not limited to MBP, but also applied to polyarginine and eosinophil cationic protein. These acidic poly aa may be useful to inhibit the actions of a number of cationic toxins released by the eosinophil in numerous hypersensitivity diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease both result from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (E.C. 3.1.4.12). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients survive into adulthood. To investigate the molecular basis for the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, the nature of the mutations causing Type B Niemann-Pick disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients was determined. The entire acid sphingomyelinase coding region from an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, subcloned, and completely sequenced. A three-base deletion was identified of nucleotides 1821-1823 in the cDNA which predicted the removal of an arginine residue from position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (delta R608). The other cDNA clones from this patient had the R496L mutation previously identified in Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients. Both Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients were heteroallelic for the delta R608 mutation, whereas this allele was not present in 15 unrelated non-Jewish Type B patients, with the notable exception of one mildly affected patient of Arabic descent who was homoallelic for the delta R608 mutation. These results indicate that the delta R608 mutation predicts the Type B Niemann-Pick disease phenotype, even in the presence of the R496L Type A allele, thereby providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for this lysosomal storage disease. Although only two patients have been studied, it appears that the delta R608 mutation occurs frequently in Type B Niemann-Pick disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\r"

We examined, therefore, the effect of a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin on PEPCK gene expression in fasted rats. 5 h after endotoxin treatment, the PEPCK transcription rate and the amount of mRNA(PEPCK) were significantly decreased at a time when the insulin/glucagon (I/G) molar ratio and plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased. Similar results were observed in a time course study, in which altered cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression paralleled changes in the I/G molar ratio. In diabetic rats treated with endotoxin, PEPCK gene expression was decreased in the absence, however, of an increased I/G molar ratio. This finding indicates that other factors, such as inflammatory mediators or cytokines, alter PEPCK gene transcription during endotoxemia. IL-6, a putative mediator of endotoxin action in the liver, had no effect on PEPCK gene expression in fasted rats, but did decrease cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression. These results indicate that, during endotoxemia, regulation of PEPCK gene expression is influenced by inflammatory mediators in addition to the classical endocrine hormones. IL-6, however, does not appear to be involved directly in the altered regulation of the PEPCK gene during endotoxemia.\r"

Met-enkephalin immunoreactivity as detected with a specific antiserum is found in the cytoplasm of monocytes but not in T lymphocytes. Secretion of met-enkephalin was analyzed with an RIA that is specific for the met-enkephalin pentapeptide. Unfractionated PBMC spontaneously released 40 pg/ml met-enkephalin and this increased two- to fourfold after stimulation with PHA. Lower levels (less than 100 pg/ml) of met-enkephalin were detected in supernatants from purified T cells that were activated with PHA and IL-2. In contrast, stimulation of purified monocytes with LPS or PMA resulted in the release of up to 600 pg/ml of the processed peptide. To examine whether T cells can produce met-enkephalin precursor peptides, T cell conditioned media were treated with trypsin and carboxypeptidase-B, which is known to release met-enkephalin from the propeptide. This increased levels of met-enkephalin to 400 pg/ml, indicating that lymphocytes secrete the propeptide but do not process it to met-enkephalin. The 1.4-kb preproenkephalin mRNA is detected in activated blood mononuclear cells and in purified monocytes and T cells. To determine whether monocytes or lymphocytes express met-enkephalin in vivo, lymphoid tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In human spleen tissue, positive cells were found in the red pulp but not in the follicles, which is also consistent with met-enkephalin expression in monocytes. In summary, these results show that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells express preproenkephalin mRNA and that monocytes, but not T cells, process the propeptide to metenkephalin.\r"

The monoclonal antibodies anti-Tac and TU27 against p55 (Tac/CD25) and p75 receptor subunits, respectively, each inhibited IL-2-dependent eosinophil migration. The molar potency of IL-2 and the inhibitory activity of each of the above antibodies suggest that high affinity heterodimeric IL-2 receptor complexes mediated the migration responses of eosinophils to IL-2. Binding of monoclonal antibody against p75 was not detectable by flow cytometry, and high affinity binding sites for 125I-IL-2 were below the limits of quantitation on eosinophils from individuals with eosinophilia. Expression of p55 (Tac/CD25) by eosinophils, without requirement for in vitro activation, was demonstrable by flow cytometry, radioimmunoprecipitation, and Northern blotting for mRNA. Surface expression of p55 on eosinophils from normal or eosinophilic individuals increased during culture for 24-48 h with a biologic activity purified from stimulated U937 cells and to a lesser extent with granulocyte-macrophage CSF or lymphocyte chemoattractant factor but not with nine other cytokines.

In this study we investigated the role mast cells in immune complex-mediated injury in mouse skin. Reverse Arthus reaction was induced in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and their congenic controls (WBB6F1(-)+/+). Serial skin sections were evaluated for neutrophil infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage. In WBB6F1-W/Wv mice the neutrophil influx was only 40% and edema 60% of that in congenic controls. Hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the mast cell-deficient mice. After mast cell reconstitution, the magnitude of the reaction in WBB6F1-W/Wv was equivalent to that in WBB6F1(-)+/+ mice. Mast cell release in reverse Arthus reaction was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity after avidin-FITC staining of mast cell granules. There was a 70% decrease in fluorescence intensity. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 significantly decreased neutrophil accumulation (40%), edema (60%), and hemorrhage in WBB6F1(-)+/+, but not in mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice restored the effect of A-63162.

  ".W": "The object of this study was to further localize autoantigenic structures on IIb-IIIa and, if possible, to precisely identify the epitopes recognized by human autoantibodies. In this paper, we identify a 50-kD chymotryptic fragment of IIIa that is recognized by a high percentage of human autoantibodies, typified by the prototype IgG autoantibody RA, which binds to IIIa on intact platelets as well as in an immunoblot assay under nonreduced conditions. Using an immunoblot assay, a carboxy-terminal region of this fragment (33 kD) that contains the cysteine-rich domains of IIIa was found to carry the epitope(s) recognized by the prototype autoantibody RA. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the reduced 33-kD fragment, the smallest fragment that retains the RA epitope, is XPSQQDEXSP, and that of the reduced 50-kD fragment is IVQVTFD. This indicates that the 33-kD fragment consists of approximately 175 amino acids beginning at residue 479 and extending at least through residues 636-654, while the 50-kD fragment spans the same region but begins at residue 427. It is apparent that the 33-kD fragment is generated from the 50-kD fragment by additional chymotryptic hydrolysis but remains associated because of the multiple disulfide bonds that are characteristic of this cysteine-rich domain. Sera from 48% of patients with chronic ITP and 2 of 8 patients with acute ITP contain antibodies that bind to the 50-kD fragment in an ELISA. Antibodies of the same specificity are also found in one-third of patients with either secondary immune thrombocytopenia or apparent non-immune thrombocytopenia. We conclude that the 50-kD cysteine-rich region of IIIa is a frequent target of autoantibodies in ITP, but that such antibodies may also be present in cases of thrombocytopenia that cannot be linked to an apparent autoimmune process.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase C is involved in mediating the effects of elevated Ca2+ in ileal villus Na+ absorbing cells to inhibit NaCl absorption. The present studies were undertaken to understand the mechanism by which this occurs. The effects of carbachol and the calcium ionophore A23187, agents which elevate intracellular Ca2+ and inhibit NaCl absorption in ileal villus cells, were studied. Carbachol treatment of villus cells caused a rapid decrease in protein kinase C activity in cytosol, with an accompanying increase in microvillus membrane C kinase. Exposure of the villus cells to calcium ionophore also caused a quantitatively similar decrease in cytosol C kinase and increase in C kinase activity in the microvillus membrane. This increase caused by carbachol and Ca2+ ionophore was specific for the microvillus membrane. In fact, 30 s and 10 min after exposure of the cells to carbachol, basolateral membrane protein kinase C decreased, in a time-dependent manner; whereas 10 min of Ca2+ ionophore exposure did not alter basolateral C kinase. Exposure of villus cells to Ca2+ ionophore or carbachol caused similar increases in microvillus membrane diacylglycerol content. As judged by the ability to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange measured in ileal villus cell brush border membrane vesicles, the protein kinase C which translocated to the microvillus membrane was functionally significant. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange required ATP and was reversed by the protein kinase C antagonist H-7. In conclusion, the effect of carbachol and Ca2+ ionophore in regulation of ileal NaCl absorption is associated with an increase in microvillus membrane diacylglycerol content and functionally active protein kinase C. The effects of both carbachol and Ca2+ ionophore are different on brush border and basolateral membrane distribution of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "Although intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin has been used extensively in experimental studies to increase lung endothelial permeability, the effect of E. coli endotoxin on lung epithelial permeability has not been well studied. To examine this issue in sheep, bidirectional movement of protein across the lung epithelial barrier was studied by labeling the vascular space with 131I-albumin and by instilling 3 ml/kg of an isosmolar protein solution with 125I-albumin into the alveoli. E. coli endotoxin was administered according to one of three protocols: intravenous alone (5-500 micrograms/kg), intravenous (5 micrograms/kg) plus low-dose alveolar endotoxin (10 micrograms/kg), and high-dose alveolar endotoxin alone (50-100 micrograms/kg). Alveolar liquid clearance was estimated based on the concentration of the instilled native protein. Sheep were studied for either 4 or 24 h. Although intravenous E. coli endotoxin produced a marked increase in transvascular protein flux and interstitial pulmonary edema, there was no effect on the clearance of either the vascular (131I-albumin) or the alveolar (125I-albumin) protein tracer across the epithelial barrier. High-dose alveolar E. coli endotoxin caused a 10-fold increase in the number of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, that accumulated in the air spaces. In spite of the marked chemotactic effect of alveolar endotoxin, there was no change in the permeability of the epithelial barrier to the vascular or alveolar protein tracers. Also, alveolar epithelial liquid clearance was normal. Morphologic studies confirmed that the alveolar epithelial barrier was not injured by either intravenous or alveolar E. coli endotoxin. Thus, the alveolar epithelium in sheep is significantly more resistant than the lung endothelium to the injurious effects of E. coli endotoxin.\r"

  ".W": "To make synthetic peptide vaccines effective in a broad population of outbred humans, one would have to incorporate enough antigenic determinants to elicit recognition by T cells of most HLA types. We have previously defined multideterminant regions of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope that include overlapping determinants seen by proliferating T cells of three or four haplotypes of mice. We have now tested the hypothesis that synthetic peptides encompassing such multideterminant regions will be recognized by T cells of multiple murine MHC types as well as by human T cells representing multiple HLA types. Six such peptides of 20-33 residues in length were prepared, and tested for their ability to stimulate T cells from mice of four distinct MHC types immunized with recombinant envelope protein rgp 160, as well as from 42 HIV-infected humans of different HLA types. Results identify several such peptides that are broadly recognized by mice of four H-2 types and by 52-73% of infected humans who still retain IL-2 productive responses to control recall antigens such as influenza A virus or tetanus toxoid. 86% of such infected donors tested against at least three peptides respond to at least one of the six peptides, and 77% of an additional group of seropositives respond to a mixture of the peptides. Moreover, the peptides can be used to immunize mice to elicit T cells reactive with the intact HIV envelope protein. These peptides therefore may be useful for both vaccine development in the broad human population, and diagnostic or prognostic use.\r"

To determine if additional benefit accrues from a combination of anti-TNF and anti-LPS MAb in the treatment of septic shock, a neutropenic rat model was developed to study active infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.4.4. Animals were treated intravenously with an irrelevant MAb (group 1); anti-TNF MAb (group 2); MAb directed against P. aeruginosa 12.4.4 LPS (group 3); or a combination of anti-TNF and anti-LPS MAb (group 4). None of the control animals in group 1 survived the 7-d period of neutropenia (0/16). In contrast, the survival rate was 44% in group 2 (P less than 0.02); 37% in group 3 (P less than 0.05); and 75% in group 4 (P less than 0.0002). The combination of monoclonal antibodies provided greater protection than either MAb given alone (P less than 0.05). Serum TNF levels during infection were significantly greater in groups 1 and 3 (20.1 +/- 3.3 U, mean +/- SE) than in groups 2 and 4 (0.9 +/- 0.8 U, P less than 0.0001). These results indicate that a combination of monoclonal antibodies to LPS and TNF have additive benefit in experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. This immunotherapeutic approach may be of potential utility in the management of serious, gram-negative bacterial infection in neutropenic patients.\r"

  ".U": "91358748\r", 
  ".W": "The emphysema of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency is conceptualized to result from insufficient alpha 1AT allowing neutrophil elastase to destroy lung parenchyma. In addition to the deficiency of alpha 1AT in these individuals resulting from mutations in the alpha 1AT gene, it is recognized that, for unknown reasons, there are also increased numbers of neutrophils in their lungs compared with normal individuals. With the knowledge that alveolar macrophages have surface receptors for neutrophil elastase, we hypothesized that the neutrophil accumulation in the lower respiratory tract in alpha 1AT deficiency may result, in part, from release of neutrophil chemotactic activity by alveolar macrophages as they bind uninhibited neutrophil elastase. Consistent with this hypothesis, alpha 1AT-deficient alveolar macrophages spontaneously released nearly threefold more neutrophil chemotactic activity than normal alveolar macrophages. Analysis of alpha 1AT-deficient macrophage supernates by reverse-phase HPLC, molecular sieve chromatography, radioimmunoassay, and absorption with anti-LTB4 antibody revealed that the majority of the chemotactic activity was leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a mediator absent from normal macrophage supernates. Consistent with this hypothesis, incubation of normal macrophages with human neutrophil elastase resulted in the release of the same neutrophil chemotactic mediator. Furthermore, purified human alpha 1AT was able to prevent the neutrophil elastase from stimulating the macrophages to release the chemotactic factor. Together, these findings suggest that the absence of a normal antineutrophil elastase screen in the lower respiratory tract permits free neutrophil elastase to bind to alveolar macrophages, resulting in the release of LTB4, a process which attracts neutrophils to the alveoli of alpha 1AT deficient individuals, thus accelerating the lung destruction that characterizes this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "91358749\r", 
  ".W": "TSH secretion is decreased by both T4 and T3. This negative feedback control of TSH secretion has been correlated with an increase in pituitary nuclear T3 content, and it is not clear whether T4 exerts its effect directly on the thyrotroph or after its deiodination to T3. However, levels of the pituitary enzyme catalyzing T4 to T3 conversion, 5'D-II, are decreased in the presence of an increased amount of T4. Thus, it is unclear why the thyrotroph would have a mechanism for modulating the production of T3, if T3 is, in fact, the sole bioactive signal providing negative feedback inhibition. To examine this apparent paradox, we administered EMD 21388, a compound which inhibits the binding of T4 to transthyretin resulting in a rapid increase in circulating free T4 levels, to rats pretreated with radiolabeled T4 and T3. We observed increases in pituitary and liver T4 content of greater than 150%, without increases in the respective tissue T3 contents. The EMD 21388-treated rats also exhibited a 25% decrease in pituitary 5'D-II activity (103.8 +/- 15.8 fmol 125I released.mg protein-1.h-1, vs. control, 137.4 +/- 15.9, mean +/- SE), as did rats treated with sodium salicylate, another compound that inhibits T4-TTR binding (100.8 +/- 7.1). TSH levels significantly decreased 2 h after the administration of EMD 21388. These data demonstrate that despite a T4-mediated decrease in pituitary 5'D-II activity, an increase in T4 independently decreases TSH secretion.\r"

In this study, we examined the possibility that smooth muscle cells (SMC) in injured rat carotid arteries are stimulated to produce type-1 transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 1) during neointima formation in vivo. Levels of TGF-beta 1 transcripts (2.4 kb) were significantly increased within 6 h after carotid injury and reached a maximum (five to sevenfold) by 24 h. Regenerating left carotids had sustained increases in TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels (about fivefold) over the next 2 wk, during which time a substantial neointimal thickening was formed. No changes in basal TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels were found in contralateral uninjured carotids at any of the times examined. Immunohistochemical studies showed that a large majority of neointimal SMC were stained for TGF-beta 1 protein in an intracellular pattern, consistent with active TGF-beta 1 synthesis in this tissue. Neointima formation and TGF-beta 1 immunoreactivity were correlated with increases in fibronectin, collagen alpha 2(I), and collagen alpha 1(III) gene expression. Infusion of purified, recombinant TGF-beta 1 into rats with a preexisting neointima produced a significant stimulation of carotid neointimal SMC DNA synthesis. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 plays an important role as an endogenous growth regulatory factor produced by neointimal SMC themselves during progressive neointimal thickening after balloon angioplasty.\r"

This study was undertaken to identify the angiotensin II receptor subtypes expressed during fetal and neonatal development and to characterize their cellular localization. Using an in situ receptor binding assay on sagittal frozen sections of fetal and neonatal rats, bound 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]-angiotensin II was visualized by film and emulsion autoradiography. Bound radioligand was detected by E11 (embryonic day 11) and maximal binding occurred by E19-21. Radioligand binding remained unaltered 30 min after birth, whereas a noticeable and stable decrease was observed 12 h postparturition. The highly abundant angiotensin II receptors were shown to be AT2 by the marked reduction in radioligand binding achieved with PD123177 (10(-7)M), a specific AT2 receptor antagonist, whereas DuP 753 (10(-5)M), an AT1 receptor antagonist, had little effect. Emulsion autoradiography showed radioligand binding in the undifferentiated mesenchyme of the submucosal layers of the intestine and stomach, connective tissue and choroid surrounding the retina, subdermal mesenchyme adjacent to developing cartilage, diaphragm, and tongue. Residual AT2 receptors were found on the dorsal subdermal region of the tongue 72 h after birth. AT1 receptors were detected in the placenta at E13 and in the aorta, kidney, lung, liver, and adrenal gland at E19-21, consistent with an adult distribution. The transient expression of AT2 receptors in the mesenchyme of the fetus suggests a role of angiotensin II in fetal development.\r"

The period of study included 8 h of nocturnal sleep, 28 h of continuous wakefulness, and 8 h of daytime sleep. Blood samples for the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, and growth hormone were collected at 20-min intervals throughout the entire study. Insulin secretion rates were derived from C-peptide levels by deconvolution. Sleep was polygraphically monitored. During nocturnal sleep, levels of glucose and insulin secretion increased by 31 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 11%, respectively, and returned to baseline in the morning. During sleep deprivation, glucose levels and insulin secretion rose again to reach a maximum at a time corresponding to the beginning of the habitual sleep period. The magnitude of the rise above morning levels averaged 17 +/- 5% for glucose and 49 +/- 8% for calculated insulin secretion. Serum insulin levels did not parallel the circadian variation in insulin secretion, indicating the existence of an approximate 40% increase in insulin clearance during the night. Daytime sleep was associated with a 16 +/- 3% rise in glucose levels, a 55 +/- 7% rise in insulin secretion, and a 39 +/- 5% rise in serum insulin. The diurnal variation in insulin secretion was inversely related to the cortisol rhythm, with a significant correlation of the magnitudes of their morning to evening excursions. Sleep-associated rises in glucose correlated with the amount of concomitant growth hormone secreted. These studies demonstrate previously underappreciated effects of circadian rhythmicity and sleep on glucose levels, insulin secretion, and insulin clearance, and suggest that these effects could be partially mediated by cortisol and growth hormone.\r"

[3H]-cholesteryl oleate-labeled small unilamellar liposomes, which are rapidly endocytosed by hepatocytes, were intravenously injected to label intrahepatic cholesterol pools, and plasma and bile were collected. FO as compared to CO induced a lowering of plasma cholesterol levels by 38% and of triglyceride levels by 69%. This reduction in plasma lipids in FO rats was accompanied by: (a) an increased bile acid pool size (28%); (b) a fourfold increase in the ratio cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid in bile; (c) increased biliary excretion of cholesterol (51%); (d) accelerated excretion of endocytosed free cholesterol into bile; (e) accelerated incorporation of endocytosed cholesterol in bile acids; (f) a significant increase in the bile acid-independent fraction of bile flow; and (g) a threefold increase in hepatic alkaline phosphatase activity.

Despite a sustained hyperpolarization (from -20.7 +/- 2.9 to -34.1 +/- 4.7 mV; P less than 0.01), 10 nM luminal AVP only slightly altered net Na+ and K+ fluxes (7.6% stimulation and no significant change, respectively). Instead, luminal AVP appeared to modulate an acetazolamide-sensitive electrogenic ion transport because 200 microM basolateral acetazolamide suppressed the luminal AVP-induced hyperpolarization (percentage of Vt from -50.4 +/- 10.8 to -5.1 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.005). In terms of water transport, 10 nM luminal AVP did not change hydraulic conductivity (Lp, x 10(-7) cm/atm per s) (from 3.9 +/- 0.8 to 5.0 +/- 1.2), but suppressed the increase in Lp induced by 20 pM basolateral AVP (134.9 +/- 19.2 vs. 204.3 +/- 21.1 in control; P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "We have examined the onset and duration of the inhibitory effect of an intravenous infusion of lipid/heparin on total body carbohydrate and fat oxidation (by indirect calorimetry) and on glucose disappearance (with 6,6 D2-glucose and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in healthy men during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Glycogen synthase activity and concentrations of acetyl-CoA, free CoA-SH, citrate, and glucose-6-phosphate were measured in muscle biopsies obtained before and after insulin/lipid and insulin/saline infusions. Lipid increased insulin-inhibited fat oxidation (+40%) and decreased insulin-stimulated carbohydrate oxidation (-63%) within 1 h. These changes were associated with an increase (+489%) in the muscle acetyl-CoA/free CoA-SH ratio. Glucose disappearance did not decrease until 2-4 h later (-55%). This decrease was associated with a decrease in muscle glycogen synthase fractional velocity (-82%). The muscle content of citrate and glucose-6-phosphate did not change. We concluded that, during hyperinsulinemia, lipid promptly replaced carbohydrate as fuel for oxidation in muscle and hours later inhibited glucose uptake, presumably by interfering with muscle glycogen formation.\r"

  ".U": "91358758\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently shown in vitro that the peroxisomal fraction of a rat liver homogenate has the highest capacity to beta-oxidize prostaglandins. In order to evaluate the relative importance of peroxisomes for this conversion also in vivo, we administered [3H]prostaglandin F2 alpha to an infant suffering from Zellweger syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of intact peroxisomes. As a control, labeled compound was administered to two healthy volunteers. Urine was collected, fractionated on a SEP-PAK C18 cartridge, and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The Zellweger patient was found to excrete prostaglandin metabolites considerably less polar than those of the control subjects. The major urinary metabolite in the control subjects was practically absent in the urine from the Zellweger patient. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the Zellweger patient was identified as an omega-oxidized C20-prostaglandin, 9,11-dihydroxy-15-oxoprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the control subjects had chromatographic properties of a tetranor (C16) prostaglandin, in accordance with earlier published data. The present results, in combination with our previous in vitro data, indicate that peroxisomal beta-oxidation is of major importance for in vivo chain shortening of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Our primary aim was to determine the extent to which intraplasmic retinyl palmitate (RP) transfers to other lipoprotein particles when chylomicron remnants are not produced and/or the plasma RP residence time is increased. The study was conducted on three familial type I hyperlipoproteinemic patients, four lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-deficient heterozygotes, and three controls on a metabolic research unit. To each subject, a fat load was administered containing 16% of total daily calories in type I patients, 40% in heterozygotes and controls, plus 60,000 U/m2 vitamin A. Triglyceride (TG) and RP levels were evaluated in chylomicron and nonchylomicron fractions. Delay in the clearance of chylomicron fraction RP and the marked deficiency in nonchylomicron-RP (presumed lack of remnant production) in all three type I patients suggests that RP does not demonstrate significant intraplasmic transfer from chylomicrons to existent apolipoprotein B100 particles. In contrast to noncoincident TG and RP peaking in the normal subject, heterozygotes were found to demonstrate coincident plasma TG and RP curves, which is consistent with a common catabolic pathway for both TG and RP and inconsistent with intraplasmic RP transfer. This corroborates reports on compromised chylomicron clearance in heterozygotes. We conclude that RP is an appropriate representative marker for intestinally derived particles in LpL-deficient or partially deficient individuals.\r"

Human bone marrow B cell precursors adhere more avidly than mature B cells to bone marrow-derived fibroblasts. To determine the mechanism of this adhesion, expression of adhesion proteins on human B precursor cells and cell lines was measured by flow cytometry. The very late antigen (VLA) integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 were the only adhesion proteins expressed at higher levels in B cell precursors than mature B cells. Antibodies to the alpha and beta chains of VLA-4, but not VLA-5, significantly blocked binding to bone marrow-derived fibroblasts of immature B cells and cell lines. Although fibronectin is a ligand for VLA-4, anti-fibronectin antibody and a soluble fibronectin fragment containing the VLA-4 binding domain did not block adhesion, suggesting that VLA-4 is involved in adhesion of B cell precursors, but not as a fibronectin receptor. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the other known counterreceptor for VLA-4, was identified on bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, and anti-VCAM-1 significantly blocked adhesion of normal B cell precursors to bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, indicating that VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions are important in adhesion of B cell precursors to the bone marrow microenvironment.\r"

Recently described BCC variants, including signet-ring BCC and granular cell BCC, are discussed. Less commonly appreciated basaloid simulants, including ameloblastoma, cloacogenic carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma, are described.

The tumors were measured every 2 weeks by calipers with a final volume determined at 120 days, at which time the tumors were harvested, weighed, and processed for routine histology. Thirty-two tumor sites were positive for persistent tumor at harvest. Tumor volumes declined by an average of 51% and average tumor weight by 33%. There were increased numbers of mast cells surrounding the BCC tumor lobules. These results indicate that BCC can survive for 120 days in the beige-nude mouse.\r"

Therefore, the use of intraoperative tissue expansion and the addition of hyaluronidase to the local anesthetic are two separate adjuncts to scalp reduction surgery.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for cases of infection that met specific criteria and for chart-recorded baseline and infection temperatures. Chart-recorded baseline temperatures were prospectively compared with re-measurement of morning temperatures. SETTING: Nursing Home Care Unit of the VAMC West Los Angeles. PATIENTS: Random review of 40 residents' charts resulted in the detection of 69 infections among 26 residents over a 20-month period. Fifty randomly selected residents prospectively underwent comparison of chart-determined and actual re-measurement of baseline temperatures. RESULTS: In 50 randomly selected residents, the mean oral baseline temperature of 97.4 +/- 0.2 (degrees F +/- SEM) closely approximated the mean nurse-recorded measures in the charts (97.6 +/- 0.1). Chart review detected 69 infections among 26 residents, with 53 episodes having a temperature recorded during the infection. The mean maximum temperature (Tmax) during an infection was 101.3 +/- 0.3 (degrees F +/- SEM) but 47% (25/53) of the episodes had a \"blunted\" fever response (Tmax less than 101 degrees F). Of the 25 \"blunted\" fevers (Tmax less than 101 degrees F), about one-fourth demonstrated an adequate change in temperature from baseline (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) but failed to reach 101 degrees F because of a low baseline. Most infections (89%) had a Tmax greater than 99 degrees F. CONCLUSION: Establishing a nursing home patient's basal temperature and monitoring for changes in temperature (delta T greater than 2.4 degrees F) and/or lowering the threshold for recognition of fevers (to 99 degrees or 100 degrees F) in nursing home residents with a change in function should assist in early recognition of infections.\r"

Dizziness is a common symptom for which the prognosis is uncertain. This report compares the prognoses for dizzy and not-dizzy older people in order to assist clinicians who diagnose and treat these patients. DESIGN: a prospective study of a representative sample of elderly (70+) non-institutionalized Americans. Elderly subjects (n = 3,798) in the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) were asked questions about the presence of dizziness, medical conditions, and functional disability in 1984. The cohort was reinterviewed about functional disability in 1986. OUTCOME MEASURE: transition from functional ability to disability after 2 years. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that dizziness predicts functional decline but not mortality. Multivariate models revealed that age, race, sensory impairment, vascular disease, and other morbidity are independent predictors of becoming disabled. Controlling for these potential confounders, dizziness does not predict an increased probability of becoming disabled. CONCLUSION: Elderly people who are dizzy should be evaluated for the presence of these related conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91358849\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: We examined predictors of hospital and 6-month mortality in older Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) patients with particular attention to age and functional status. Age is generally thought to be strongly associated with intensive care outcomes, but this relationship may be confounded by age-related changes. These age-related changes may be approximated by changes in functional status (FS). DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective chart review and collected severity of illness data using the Acute Physiology Score (APS), pre-hospitalization FS dichotomized as limited or not limited, and hospital mortality. County death records were reviewed for 6-month mortality. SETTING: Three community hospital MICUs. PATIENTS: Four-hundred MICU patients aged 50 and older admitted during the study period. RESULTS: Limited FS was found in 42% of the 227 patients who had FS data in the chart. Mortality was significantly associated with APS, age, FS, immunocompromise state, comorbidity, and nursing home residence. In logistic regression analyses, while controlling for important variables, APS (P less than 0.001) and age greater than or equal to 75 with limited FS (P less than 0.05) were associated with hospital mortality. Six-month mortality predictors were APS (P less than 0.001), hospital (P less than 0.05), immunocompromised state (P less than 0.05) and age greater than or equal to 75 with limited FS (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found that among patients without functional limitations, the oldest group was no more likely to die than the youngest group. Age and functional status had a significant interaction: patients older than 75 years with functional limitations were almost six times more likely to die in hospital compared to the reference group of patients between 50-64 years old without functional limitations. We conclude that functional status is an important predictor of outcome in older MICU patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE. To examine the relationship between selected resident and facility characteristics and the frequency and quality of tranquilizer prescribing and use in skilled nursing facilities. DESIGN. Retrospective review of medication profiles and pharmacy billing records using standardized protocol. SETTINGS. Seven skilled nursing facilities. PARTICIPANTS. All residents aged 65 years or older were eligible. Consent was given by 760 residents or guardians. Six refused permission. OUTCOME MEASURES. Drug use measures included the presence or absence of a tranquilizer order, any tranquilizer use during previous 30 days, and any deviation from selected drug use criteria. RESULTS. Of 760 residents, 38% had an order for an antipsychotic or antianxiety agent, and 28% actually received a tranquilizer. Comparing tranquilizer practices with specific drug-use criteria showed that nearly 19% of all elderly residents were exposed to some type of excess use such as long duration, polymedicine, or therapeutic duplication. Residents in facilities with less adequate staffing and other resources were significantly more likely to have a tranquilizer order, to have a tranquilizer administered, and to have any deviation from drug-use criteria. The data also show higher rates of deviation from criteria among residents with a diagnosed mental disorder, younger residents, and Medicaid recipients. CONCLUSION. More attention must be paid to environmental factors that may undermine current efforts to improve psychotropic drug prescribing and use in skilled nursing facilities.\r"

Subjects were 109 elderly outpatients with Alzheimer's dementia and 100 non-demented outpatient controls. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the MMSE were examined among three strata of educational attainment: middle school, high school, and college/graduate school. MMSE ROC curve areas were .95-.96 in the three educational strata. Assuming a dementia prevalence of 10%-30%, the most accurate lower limits of normal for MMSE scores and their attendant sensitivities and specificities were 21 for middle school (.82/.94), 23 for high school (.79/.97), and 24 for college/graduate school (.83/1.00) attainment. These norms accurately classified over 90% of subjects in all three educational strata. We conclude that education-specific norms optimize performance of the MMSE as a screening test for Alzheimer's dementia in elderly outpatients.\r"

DESIGN, PATIENTS, & SETTING: Depressive disorders were examined using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule in 116 young and 332 elderly medically ill men hospitalized in a VA medical center. RESULTS: Major depressive disorder was diagnosed in 22.4% of men under 40 and 13.3% of those age 70 or over; minor depression was found in 18.1% of young and 29.2% of older men. Besides age, other risk factors for major depression were impaired social support, severe medical illness or functional disability in older men, and history of psychiatric problems primarily in younger men; specific medical diagnosis was not a risk factor. Major depression was associated with more severe symptomatology in younger patients; in both age groups, however, symptoms were of prolonged duration and frequently included suicidal thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorder in hospitalized male veterans is common, varies with age, severity of medical illness, degree of social support, and history of psychiatric problems and is associated with considerable psychological morbidity.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The basal serum concentrations of TNF and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1) were measured in 129 elderly nursing home patients (mean age of 89 years), and survival in the cohort was monitored over a 13-month period. RESULTS: At 4 months follow-up, seven out of 33 patients with detectable serum TNF levels had died (21.2%), and only three out of 96 patients with undetectable serum TNF levels had died (3.1%) (P less than 0.001). The difference in mortality remained significant up to 13 months of follow-up (P less than 0.05). Those with detectable serum TNF levels and those with undetectable levels were comparable in age, body mass index, hematocrit, lymphocyte counts, and serum level of albumin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein. When patients with detectable serum IL-1 levels were compared to those with undetectable levels, there were no significant differences in mortality over a 13-month period. CONCLUSION: Detectable serum TNF levels in elderly nursing home patients may be a predictor of early mortality.\r"

Aggressive treatment of advanced pressure sores is often inconsistent with the overall goals of therapy. Private and public funding for effective prevention and early treatment are restricted and constrained. Little information is available that proves treatment efficacy. Health care professionals and their institutions are often stigmatized by the occurrence of a pressure sore even though accountabilities may lie in the natural history of the disease. We use case analysis to identify ethical dilemmas in pressure sore prevention and management and suggest a framework for ethical decisionmaking so that health care professionals and public policy analysts can make informed judgments about patients and standards of quality care.\r"

Oral cancer is one-fifth as common as cancer of the breast, colon, and lung but more than twice as common as cervical cancer. Incidence rates for oral cancer are highest among older men. Epidemiologic data identify alcohol and tobacco as major risk factors associated with the disease. Screening for oral cancer is a simple, non-invasive procedure which can be easily incorporated into the comprehensive assessment of older patients. Oral cancer screening can detect early, localized lesions which are associated with an improved prognosis. Five-year survival rates are more than four times greater in individuals with localized lesions than those with distant metastases. Since older Americans visit their physician more often than their dentist, the physician's medical examination provides an excellent opportunity to screen for oral cancers.\r"

Despite an extensive body of literature documenting the effectiveness of GA for improving health care outcomes in many settings for identifiable groups of frail elderly patients, no explicit Medicare reimbursement mechanisms currently exist to cover GA services provided by either hospital or physician. We believe that new physician reimbursement codes specific for geriatric assessment should be established in the Current Procedural Technology (CPT-4) manual and that reimbursement for GA should be specifically provided under Part B of Medicare. Further, we believe that hospital reimbursement within the Medicare prospective payment system should be modified to encourage GA during inpatient stays for appropriate patients. This paper summarizes the background for these recommendations. It defines the major content of GA at three levels of intensity--screening, intermediate, and comprehensive. It describes the major sites for conducting GA--hospital, office, home, nursing home. Finally, it proposes criteria for targeting patients most likely to benefit from GA.\r"

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search (restricted to English language); bibliographies of pertinent articles or books. STUDY SELECTION: Studies included only if aim was to follow a cohort of AD patients; diagnosis of AD used DSM-III-R or NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines; techniques or scales used for serial assessment were well-established in terms of validity and reliability. DATA EXTRACTION: All 3 authors reviewed all studies cited and reached consensus about interpretation. RESULTS: Global instruments detect long term deterioration in AD and describe distinct through possibly artificial stages. Cognitive screening tests decline at a consistent rate for groups of AD patients but show considerable variability. Scales measuring activities of daily living (ADLs) need further study to determine annual rate of change. Instrumental ADLs decline early in AD and reach a floor before cognitive screening tests. Electrophysiologic or radiographic techniques do not necessarily change over time and are not superior to clinical methods for following AD. Variability in rate of cognitive change and prognosis in AD has not been adequately explained. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive screening tests provide useful measures of rate of change in AD for clinical and therapeutic studies. Further studies should take advantage of longer follow-up and more sophisticated statistical techniques to optimize use of these measures.\r"

Second, the intervention requires a clear definition, including its component parts, to improve replication across multiple sites. Third, the type of randomization (ie, by hospital or by patient) and the timing of randomization (ie, at admission or at some later point during care) need to be considered. Fourth, because this type of intervention cannot be administered in a blind fashion, bias is a critical concern. Outcome measures must be selected carefully so that those least susceptible to bias are given the highest priority. Despite the need to address all of these questions, the time is upon us to conduct a multi-site trial of geriatric evaluation and management programs.\r"

Studies of GEM have occurred primarily in three settings: inpatient units, outpatient clinics, and specialized types of home care. We have reviewed the literature, focusing on randomized trials, to determine the strength of the evidence for the efficacy of these interventions. Two single-site randomized controlled trials of inpatient GEM units have been conducted and indicate that such units that provide care to targeted disabled older patients probably have a favorable impact on subsequent physical function, rates of institutionalization, and mortality. Two randomized trials of inpatient GEM consultation teams have been conducted. The trial that did not target high-risk individuals showed no benefit while the trial that did target an at-risk group showed that those receiving the service had improvements in mental status and short-term mortality. The results of randomized trials of outpatient GEM clinics to date have been unimpressive. Two trials of in-home GEM by a trained observer tended to show that the service resulted in a reduction in mortality. To date randomized trials of GEM have been very heterogeneous in terms of the type of assessment and subsequent care, the site in which services are delivered, and the manner in which patients are selected for the studies. This limits the ability to compare and extrapolate across studies. In the future there is a need to better clarify the selection of study participants, the exact structure of the assessment intervention provided, and the elements of successful interventions that may be most critical to insuring a good outcome.\r"

Such patients are those who are neither too sick (eg, severely demented or moribund) nor too well. Various strategies for identifying such patients have been employed by investigators with little consensus on the most efficient targeting criteria. Criteria most often use for inclusion in GEM programs are various combinations of patient age, degree of functional impairment, presence of geriatric conditions (eg falls, incontinence, confusion), particular diagnostic conditions (eg, multiple disorders), and psychosocial conditions (eg, living alone, recent bereavement, low income). Commonly used exclusion factors are severe dementia, inevitable nursing home placement, and terminal illness. Outcome studies suggest that beneficial effects of GEM care are most apparent when patients are selected using specific clinical criteria. Future research on targeting should address the potential need for differing criteria in different settings (eg, inpatient vs outpatient GEM units), simplifications of criteria for greatest ease of application, and prospective evaluation of which criteria best predict functional improvement, longer survival, and reduced health care expenditures in response to GEM care.\r"

For each program type, the group outlined targeting criteria based on current literature and experience. Because research has not yet established the effectiveness of many of these patient targeting strategies, the group drafted a set of research questions, pertinent to targeting, that require attention: (1) For each identifiable population of elderly people, who are most likely to benefit from GEM? (2) How should these people best be identified/targeted? (3) What criteria should be used for targeting? (4) How and how often should population screening be performed to identify persons in need of GEM?\r"

If replication studies show similar results, further studies should be undertaken to define the minimum necessary intervention to achieve the desired outcome. Controlled trials are needed to determine if consultative geriatric evaluation and/or primary patient management is effective. Further innovative work is needed in model development for geriatric assessment and management in outpatient settings.

The group favored a randomized clinical trial in which the inpatient geriatric evaluation and management unit was coupled with outpatient geriatric care. Inclusion of a broad spectrum of patients stratified according to risk for poor hospital outcomes was proposed in order to obtain information on the types of patients that would be most likely to benefit. The need for a detailed definition and description of care in the unit and of \"usual care\" was emphasized. Serious concerns were raised about including both VA medical centers and private hospitals in the same trial due to differences in the implementation of such a program. Furthermore, fears of contamination of the control group suggested that hospitals could be randomized either to provide usual care or have a GEM unit. However, this strategy would necessitate that hospitals that have already developed inpatient GEM units would be excluded from the trial and could be costly because of the number of hospitals that would be required.\r"

GEM units have as a major goal the improvement or maintenance of both physical and psychosocial function. Suggested outcome measures for physical health included survival, restricted activity days, general health perceptions, comprehensive physical function, and miscellaneous specific types of functioning. In the area of psycho-social function, the working group suggested measuring cognitive function, affect/life satisfaction, social function, and satisfaction with care. The patient's caregiver (eg, spouse or child) is often an important target of GEM care, and the group suggested measuring caregiver burden, life satisfaction, and assessment of patient behavior problems. While the primary goal of GEM units is to improve health status, their effects on the utilization and cost of health care are important to decisions about wide-spread implementation and funding. The group therefore suggested a comprehensive assessment of these outcomes. Among the large array of recommended outcomes, the most important were thought to be mortality, function, and cost.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper, we present the consensus statement from a national conference on research priorities and methodologies for studying geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) programs. These conclusions, discussion points, and recommendations resulted from discussions of plenary papers, working group deliberations, and a final session in which findings were synthesized by the conference co-chairmen and presented to conference participants for final review. Major conclusions included: (1) The importance of linking geriatric evaluation with care management in future studies; (2) The need for multi-center trials of inpatient units to establish efficacy; (3) The importance of studying criteria for targeting GEM care on patients who are most likely to benefit; (4) The need for further developmental studies of outpatient GEM clinics; (5) The importance of assessing a range of outcomes including mortality, patient function, satisfaction, caregiver burden, and cost; and (6) The need to define more carefully the nature of the intervention that is being studied to aid in comparing and extrapolating findings. The following research priorities for GEMS were formulated based on the conference: (1) Within the VA health care system, a multi-site randomized trial of inpatient GEM units should be initiated; (2) Multi-site studies of inpatient GEM units and consultation teams linked to outpatient care should be initiated in non-VA settings; (3) Studies should identify the components of GEM that are most critical to outcome; (4) Studies should explore efficacy of GEM in settings that have not been well studied to date such as nursing homes; and (5) Studies are needed to test screening methods and targeting criteria for GEM in all settings.\r"

  ".W": "Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a technique for multidimensional diagnosis of frail elderly people with the purpose of planning and/or delivering medical, psychosocial, and rehabilitative care. When comprehensive geriatric assessment is coupled with some therapy, then the term geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) will be used. Following a brief history of comprehensive geriatric assessment, we describe the varied patterns of GEM program organization and review the literature of studies examining GEM effectiveness. Program diversity complicates drawing firm conclusions about GEM effects; however, the vast majority of studies report positive, if not uniformly significant, results. Our analysis suggests that much of the variability in findings is due to sample size limitations. In order to reach conclusions of program effects across studies and to avoid problems of small sample sizes, we undertook a formal meta-analysis. In this initial meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the effect of GEM programs on a single outcome: mortality. We pooled all published GEM controlled trials into four major groups: inpatient consultation services, inpatient GEM units, home assessment services, and outpatient GEM programs. Meta-analysis of 6-month mortality demonstrates a 39% reduction of mortality for inpatient consultation services (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.81, P = 0.0008) and a 37% reduction of mortality for inpatient GEM units (odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.93, P = 0.02). Home assessment services reduced mortality by 29% (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.90, P = 0.005). On the other hand, no significant survival effect was found for outpatient GEM programs (odds ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.61-1.49).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The intrinsic epithelial defenses against acid injury in the esophagus can be labeled \"tissue resistance.\" Tissue resistance is not a single factor but a number of structural and functional elements within the epithelium that interact in a dynamic way to provide protection. This article enumerates the components of this epithelial defense system and describes their roles in the protective process. Furthermore, the ability of agents such as indomethacin and sucralfate to provide protection against acid injury to esophageal epithelium is discussed in light of their known actions at the tissue level.\r"

Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe and complications can occur, particularly if the disorder is untreated or undertreated. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, healing lesions, and preventing complications. Various pharmacologic options are available for treatment, including antacids, alginate/antacid compounds, acid-reducing agents, prokinetic drugs, and agents that protect the mucosa. This article reviews a number of clinical studies evaluating sucralfate in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. Almost all of the investigations were conducted in Europe and encompassed open-label studies, placebo-controlled trials, and comparative studies. From the studies discussed, it can be concluded that sucralfate not only has a place in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, but is also effective in treating reflux esophagitis. Sucralfate is comparable to H2-receptor antagonists in symptom improvement and healing rates. In addition, the studies reviewed have shown sucralfate to be safe and well tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "This article emphasizes and reviews the premise that because the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury is multifactorial, several protective mechanisms should also be considered in analyzing gastric mucosal defense. The first part of the article reviews the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury by major etiologic factors such as hypoxia and chemical and biological agents, and emphasizes the common endogenous mediators of damage (e.g, endothelins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, monoamines, free radicals, proteases, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids--in decreasing potency). The second part of the review is devoted to the gastroprotective mechanisms that are analyzed by anatomical (histologic) location and biochemical processes. The endogenous mediators of acute gastroprotection include prostaglandins, sulfhydryl (SH) compounds, non-SH antioxidants, polyamines, and epidermal growth factor, whereas the protective and mediatory role of glucocorticoids, somatostatin, pentagastrin, histamine, gangliosides, and calcitonin gene-related peptide need further studies. A list of endogenous and exogenous chemicals that exert biphasic, damaging, and protective effects on the gastric mucosa in also included. The final common pathway of acute gastroprotection at the structural and functional level seems to be the preservation of subepithelial microvascular integrity leading to maintenance of mucosal blood flow that allows the energy-dependent rapid restitution (cell migration) from surviving gastric neck cells to repair the superficial epithelial defect. Very new data on the contribution of a histodilutional barrier and release of proteases to gastroprotective processes are also discussed.\r"

Although stress-related mucosal lesions may be detected endoscopically in most critically ill patients, the incidence of clinically significant bleeding from these lesions is difficult to establish because of the heterogeneity in patient populations, the definitions of bleeding, and the methods of monitoring in various studies. Bleeding occurs overall in approximately 16% of patients not receiving prophylaxis, but the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage appears to be much lower (less than 6%). In light of the increasing use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in ICUs, the clinical impact of stress-related bleeding and its prophylaxis is discussed in terms of bleeding incidence, morbidity and mortality, cost, and potential side effects. The pathophysiology of stress-related mucosal ulceration involves the complex interaction of gastric luminal factors, alterations in blood flow and intramucosal pH, and alterations in numerous factors that are normally responsible for maintaining an intact mucosa. The pathophysiology of stress ulceration is discussed, with an emphasis on cause-and-effect relationships, evolving areas of investigation, and implications for prophylaxis and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have reported upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in 5-25% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe stress despite the use of antacids and/or H2-antagonists. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, a meta-analysis of all prospective studies on the prevention of stress bleeding, available from the international literature, was conducted. Only macroscopically visible bleeds were considered. Because alkalinization of the gastric juice has been incriminated in facilitating gastric and pulmonary colonization, agents with little or no influence on the gastric pH have been increasingly investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. The meta-analysis was therefore extended to determine the efficacy of two newer substances, pirenzepine and sucralfate, in preventing macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as their influence on pulmonary infections and mortality. Antacids and H2-antagonists proved to be significantly superior to untreated controls, with the tendency in favor of antacids administered in short intervals as compared to H2-antagonists. Pirenzepine and sucralfate were significantly superior to H2-antagonists, and sucralfate was as effective as an adequate antacid regimen. Patient groups treated with antacids or H2-antagonists showed a significantly higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. The most significant differences was found in long-term ventilated patients compared with patients treated with sucralfate. In the same patient group, antacids and H2-antagonists also showed a significantly higher mortality rate than sucralfate.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology of gastric and duodenal ulcer disease has two sides: the aggressive attack, principally by the highly corrosive gastric acid; and the defending forces of mucus, mucosal resistance, and other protective substances and functions. This report reviews the roles of both the attacking and defending forces in the pathophysiology of ulcer disease. It also discusses how an early notion of ulcer formation (e.g., the Schwarz dictum of \"no acid, no ulcer,\" first published in 1910) became the slogan by which ulcer disease was understood and from which therapy took its cue. Subsequent work has since found that the Schwarz dictum holds for duodenal ulcer, but not for gastric ulcer. Non-acid mechanisms of ulcer formation--i.e., impairment of at least one of the defending or protective forces--are also described, as are treatment approaches to ulcer disease. Although suppression of acid secretion is a mainstay of treatment, agents that safely and effectively strengthen the defense are being used more frequently. There are signs that the safe limits for acid-suppressing therapy have been reached or passed. On the other hand, the search for therapy that strengthens the defensive factors has only begun.\r"

Gastric factors--volume, secretion, the character of the refluxant, and the rate of gastric emptying--also play a role in the pathogenesis of GERD. Treatment requires an individualized approach based on the extent of the symptoms, esophagitis, and other reflux complications. Three phases of treatment--lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic manipulation, and surgery--are discussed, as is maintenance therapy and prevention of recurrent disease.\r"

Age-related anatomical and physiologic changes occur in the major organ systems, affecting functions as diverse as swallowing and hepatic and renal clearance of therapeutic drugs. Because of these factors, and because older patients are more likely to be receiving multiple drugs for concomitant illness, they are more prone to drug-drug interactions and to medication-induced injury of the esophagus and stomach. In addition, several gastrointestinal disorders, notably gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, are commonly seen in the elderly. This report reviews those age-related system changes that affect the gastrointestinal tract, and also reviews the esophageal and gastric disorders that are common and/or particularly problematic in the elderly. Diagnostic techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal disease in older patients and approaches to therapy for this population are described as well.\r"

The authors review their experience with 18 cases of primary otalgia during the past 15 years. A total of 31 surgical procedures were performed. Seventeen patients had sequential rhizotomies and one patient had microvascular decompression alone. Based on the clinical diagnosis, the nerves sectioned were singly or in combination: the nervus intermedius (14 patients), geniculate ganglion (10 patients), ninth nerve (14 patients), 10th nerve (11 patients), tympanic nerve (four patients), and chorda tympani nerve (one patient). Microvascular decompression of the involved nerves was undertaken in nine patients, in whom vascular loops were discovered. Adhesions (six patients), thickened arachnoid (three patients), and benign osteoma (one patient) were other intraoperative abnormalities noted. The overall success of these procedures in providing pain relief was 72.2%, and the mean follow-up period was 3.3 years (range 1 month to 14.5 years). There was no surgical mortality. Expected side effects were: decreased lacrimation, salivation, and taste related to nervus intermedius nerve section, and transient hoarseness and diminished gag related to ninth and 10th nerve section. Four patients developed sequelae consisting of sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and transient facial nerve paresis. One patient had a cerebrospinal fluid leak and another developed aseptic meningitis as postoperative complications. Except when primary glossopharyngeal neuralgia is the working diagnosis, a combined posterior cranial fossa-middle cranial fossa approach is recommended for adequate exploration and/or section of the fifth, ninth, and 10th cranial nerves as well as the geniculate ganglion and nervus intermedius.\r"

In an initial 3-year experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 227 patients with AVM's were treated. Symptoms at presentation included prior hemorrhage in 143 patients (63%), headache in 104 (46%), and seizures in 70 (31%). Neurological deficits were present in 102 patients (45%). Prior surgical resection (resulting in subtotal removal) had been performed in 36 patients (16%). In 47 selected patients (21%), embolization procedures were performed in an attempt to reduce the AVM size prior to radiosurgery. The lesions were classified according to the Spetzler grading system: 64 (28%) were Grade VI (inoperable), 22 (10%) were Grade IV, 90 (40%) were Grade III, 43 (19%) were Grade II, and eight (4%) were Grade I. With the aid of computer imaging-integrated isodose plans for single-treatment irradiation, total coverage of the AVM nidus was possible in 216 patients (95%). The location and volume of the AVM were the most important factors for the selection of radiation dose. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 6-month intervals in 161 patients. Seventeen patients who had MR evidence of complete obliteration underwent angiography within 3 months of imaging: in 14 (82%) complete obliteration was confirmation being 4 months (mean 17 months) after radiosurgery. The 2-year obliteration rates according to volume were: all eight (100%) AVM's less than 1 cu cm; 22 (85%) of 26 AVM's of 1 to 4 cu cm; and seven (58%) of 12 AVM's greater than 4 cu cm. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed postirradiation changes in 38 (24%) of 161 patients at a mean interval of 10.2 months after radiosurgery; only 10 (26%) of those 38 patients were symptomatic. In the entire series, two patients developed permanent new neurological deficits believed to be treatment-related. Two patients died of repeat hemorrhage at 6 and 23 months after treatment during the latency interval prior to obliteration. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an important method to obliterate AVM's, especially those previously considered inoperable. Success and complication risks are related to the AVM location and the volume treated.\r"

Six small and two giant aneurysms were treated surgically: four were clipped, two were repaired primarily, and two were trapped with placement of a saphenous-vein bypass graft. Seven large and four giant aneurysms were treated with interventional radiological techniques: in five cases the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) was sacrificed; one aneurysm was trapped with detachable balloons; and five were embolized with preservation of the ICA lumen. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. At follow-up examination, three patients in the surgical group were asymptomatic, two had improved, and three had worsened. Three of these patients had asymptomatic infarctions apparent on computerized tomography (CT) scans. At follow-up examination, four radiologically treated patients were asymptomatic, five had improved, two were unchanged, and none had worsened. One patient had asymptomatic and one minimally symptomatic infarction apparent on CT scans; both lesions were embolic foci after aneurysm embolization with preservation of the ICA. It is concluded that treatment risk depends more on the adequacy of collateral circulation than on the size of the aneurysm. A multidisciplinary treatment protocol for these aneurysms is described, dividing patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups based on pretreatment evaluation of the risk of temporary or permanent ICA occlusion using a clinical balloon test occlusion coupled with an ICA-occluded stable xenon/CT cerebral blood flow study. Radiological techniques are suggested for most low-risk patients, while direct surgical techniques are proposed for most moderate- and high-risk patients.\r"

Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988. The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988. A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. The infection rate was 3.8%. Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count. Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course. These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001). Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01). In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present. This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts. Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures. In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection.\r"

Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients.\r"

Among 325 patients with sickle-cell disease followed at the University of Illinois between 1975 and 1989, 11 cases of SAH were identified. Aneurysms were found in 10 of these patients, three of whom had multiple aneurysms. All of the patients had some degree of anemia and nine underwent craniotomy without hematological or neurological complications. From this review it appears that SAH is not uncommon in sickle-cell disease patients and tends to occur at a younger age and with smaller aneurysm size than in the general population. With proper perioperative management, including exchange transfusions to reduce the proportion of hemoglobin S to less than 30%, these patients can undergo angiography and craniotomy without an increased incidence of complications. The techniques used in managing sickle-cell disease patients with SAH are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Hochberg and Pruitt have reported glioblastomas recurring within 2 cm of the primary site in 90% of patients after whole-brain radiation therapy. They suggested that computerized tomography (CT) scan accuracy would permit smaller radiation fields. A treatment protocol with smaller-field focal brain irradiation following surgical resection is reported. The first 4500 cGy of radiation is focused to within a 3-cm margin around the tumor, with a 1500-cGy boost within a 1.5-cm margin. Forty-two patients with grade III or IV astrocytoma, treated with focal brain radiation therapy were reviewed retrospectively to assess patterns of tumor recurrence. Thirty patients received intra-arterial bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) radiosensitization with focal brain radiation therapy, and 12 patients underwent conventional focal brain radiation therapy. Tumor margin was defined on preoperative and recurrence CT scans as the contrast-enhanced area; these were traced on acetate templates and compared with each other and with the actual scans. In all 42 patients, the lesion recurred within a 2-cm margin of the original tumor. Four patients had two recurrent areas: the second area was within the 2-cm margin in two, and outside this margin in two. These results are similar to those of Hochberg and Pruitt. It is suggested that focal irradiation is now the optimal treatment for malignant astrocytoma. Since recurrences continue to be within the irradiated volumes, it appears that higher focal doses of radiation are appropriate for clinical treatment trials of malignant astrocytomas.\r"

This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors. The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature. This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad). The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection.\r"

  ".U": "91359059\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy-seven patients presenting with medulloblastoma between 1958 and 1986 were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and studied retrospectively. Multimodality therapy utilized surgical extirpation followed by megavoltage irradiation. In 15 cases chemotherapy was used as adjunctive treatment. The 10- and 15-year actuarial survival rates were both 41% with an 18-year maximum follow-up period (median 4.75 years). There were no treatment failures after 8 years of tumor-free survival. Gross total removal of tumor was achieved in 22 patients (32%); the surgical mortality rate was 3.9%. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of metastatic disease between shunted and nonshunted patients. The classical form of medulloblastoma was present in 67% of cases while the desmoplastic subtype was found in 16%. Survival rates were best for patients presenting after 1970, for those with desmoplastic tumors, and for patients receiving high-dose irradiation (greater than or equal to 5000 cGy) to the posterior fossa. Although early data on freedom from relapse suggested a possible beneficial effect from chemotherapy, long-term follow-up results showed no advantage from this modality of treatment. The patterns of relapse and survival were examined; 64% of relapses occurred within the central nervous system, and Collins' rule was applicable in 83% of cases beyond the period of risk. Although patients treated for recurrent disease could be palliated, none were long-term survivors. The study data indicate that freedom from relapse beyond 8 years from diagnosis can be considered as a cure in this disease. Long-term follow-up monitoring is essential to determine efficacy of treatment and to assess survival patterns accurately.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one intracranial subependymomas were reviewed with regard to presentation, diagnosis, operative findings, and long-term follow-up data. The histopathological features were critically reviewed, and deoxyribunucleic acid analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The patients' mean age was 48.5 years (range 32 to 72 years). In 14 cases the tumor was located in the fourth ventricle, in six within a lateral ventricle, and in one in the third ventricle with extension into the lateral ventricle. Radiographic characteristics included isodensity with minimal enhancement on computerized tomography, frequent dystrophic calcification, and isointensity on T1-weighted or slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. The predominant histological features in all cases were those of classic subependymoma. Nonetheless, pathological examination showed a minor (less than 20%) ependymoma component in five cases, significant cytological atypia in seven, mitoses in 11, endothelial prominence in four, and focal hemorrhage-associated necrosis in two. Flow cytometry revealed a diploid pattern in 12 patients, tetraploidy in two, and aneuploidy in one. Two patients died in the perioperative period. Of the remaining 19, 12 underwent gross total resection (two of whom received postoperative irradiation) and seven underwent subtotal resection (five of whom received irradiation). None of the 12 non-irradiated patients developed tumor progression or died of direct tumor-related causes. Of the seven irradiated patients, follow-up imaging studies demonstrated their tumors to be radioresponsive, particularly with doses of 5000 cGy or greater. Despite the presence of cytological atypia and mitotic activity in the majority of cases, the prognostic effects of such factors as tumor location and the extent of surgical resection outweighed those of the standard histopathological parameters. Routine postoperative irradiation is not recommended, but should be reserved for cases with a symptomatic residual or recurrent subependymomas following surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The term \"angioglioma\" denotes a highly vascular glioma, most of which are low-grade lesions associated with a favorable prognosis. The authors encountered an example of this pathology, a cystic oligodendroglioma associated with prominent vasculature which both clinically and histologically mimicked an occult arteriovenous malformation (AVM). This case and reports of the association of AVM and glioma prompted a histological review of 1034 surgically resected AVM's, both angiographically occult and visible, among which no oligodendroglial or astrocytic forms of \"angioglioma\" were found. Eight cases were observed, however, wherein oligodendroglial cells were increased in number within or about the malformation. Two basic histological patterns of oligodendroglial cell excess were seen; one appeared to be malformative in nature with abnormal disposition of oligodendroglial cells being an integral part of the AVM, whereas in the other an apparent increase in cellularity seemed the result of chronic ischemia with condensation of white matter. It appeared that the areas of increased oligodendrocyte content seen in association with AVM are non-neoplastic lesions that exhibit two rather distinct histological patterns of differing origin. In an effort to determine the frequency of \"angioglioma,\" the authors examined Tissue Registry data for several glioma groups in which highly vascular examples are prone to occur. Tumors selected for study included 104 cerebellar-type (pilocytic) astrocytomas, 82 oligodendrogliomas, and 51 supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas. Histological hypervascularity mimicking a vascular malformation (that is, an \"angioglioma\") was encountered in 5%, 4%, and 12% of the cases, respectively. Based upon clinical, radiological, and pathological reviews of these cases, as well as a careful review of the literature, it was concluded that 1) \"angiogliomas\" are neither rare nor represent a distinct clinicopathological entity; 2) in histological but not necessarily angiographic surgical terms, they represent simply highly vascular gliomas, usually of low grade; and 3) the clinicopathological and angiographic features as well as the prognosis of such lesions do not differ from those of similar gliomas without angioma-like vasculature. Finally, \"angiogliomas\" must not be confused with gliomas of high-grade malignancy which, due to neovascularity, may be highly vascular at angiography and at surgery.\r"

A growth inhibition assay revealed no inhibiting effect in vitro up to a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml rHuTNF-alpha. Receptor-binding studies showed that RG-2 cells did not present specific receptors for rHuTNF-alpha. The pharmacokinetics of rHuTNF-alpha after intravenous injection were studied with respect to serum, tissue, and brain tumor concentrations and showed increased glioma concentrations of (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 0.47 +/- 0.18 ng TNF/mg brain compared to 0.15 +/- 0.05 ng TNF/mg brain in the normal contralateral hemisphere. No therapeutic effect on solid RG-2 gliomas could be observed after stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF/10 microliter buffer solution into the tumor in 10 animals. Immunohistochemical studies after stereotactic injection of rHuTNF-alpha showed total disappearance of the substance after 24 hours without internalization into tumor cells. Stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF 10 microliters into normal brain resulted in marked inflammatory response around the injection track, including microvascular thrombosis. These results demonstrate that rHuTNF has neither direct nor indirect cytotoxic activity on RG-2 glioma cells. Furthermore, before clinical use of rHuTNF-alpha in malignant gliomas, the authors suggest that receptor studies be done in each patient. In receptor-positive patients undergoing treatment with rHuTNF-alpha, precautions should be taken to prevent local encephalitic reactions.\r"

  ".U": "91359063\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelial cell proliferation is a significant biological feature of malignant astrocytomas. The ability of the cells of these tumors to elaborate mitogenic angiogenesis factors has been well documented. However, less is known about the transformational effects that neoplastic astrocytes may have on the endothelial cells within malignant astrocytomas. In this study, the hypothesis that humoral factors elaborated by cells derived from malignant astrocytomas induce transformational changes in normal endothelial cells in vitro is investigated. Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from exponentially growing cultures of a human glioblastoma cell line (UW18) and from two rat brain-tumor cell lines: an anaplastic astrocytoma (R175A) and a glioblastoma with sarcomatous elements (9L). Subconfluent target bovine aortic arch endothelial cells (BAEC's) were exposed for 48 hours to varying concentrations of CM prepared from each of these tumors, and then evaluated for transformational changes. Different molecular weight (MW) fractions of UW18 CM were prepared by molecular ultrafiltration, and each fraction was tested for transforming activity. Transformation endpoints included changes in cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and distribution (measured by differential flow cytometry) and changes in de novo DNA synthesis determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Significant changes in the amount and distribution of DNA and RNA were observed in the BAEC's treated with UW18 CM compared to untreated BAEC's. At 10% concentrations of UW18 CM, changes in the RNA profile of target BAEC's were evident, and at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM, an irregular bimodal distribution was well established. Patterns of DNA were also altered in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant aneuploidy developing at UW18 CM concentrations of 20%. The DNA synthesis in BAEC's increased with increasing CM concentrations, up to a maximum of about 250% of control values at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM. The transformational changes induced after exposure of BAEC's to CM prepared from R175A and 9L were significantly less than those observed with UW18 CM. Molecular ultrafiltration was used to prepare UW18 CM fractions with MW cutoffs of less than 10 kD, 10 to 30 kD, and greater than 30 kD. Transformational activity was significant only in CM's with an MW of 10 to 30 kD. It is concluded that the UW18 human glioblastoma cell line elaborates a soluble factor, or group of factors, with an MW in the 10- to 30-kD range, capable of inducing transformational alterations in target normal endothelial cells, and that such transformation may account for some of the abnormal endothelial cell changes associated with malignant astrocytomas.\r"

  ".W": "Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm. Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a silicone sheath. Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days. Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter silica quartz fiber introduced through the femoral artery. The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control. No instances of laser-induced perforation or of arterial thrombosis were observed for up to 60 days after treatment. Prophylactic laser application to nine normal vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later. Studies in 16 normal CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce dilatation and that which caused perforation, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery. Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal hyperplasia. Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers. In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart. Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively. Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively. Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia was preserved. These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium is essential for their migration and requires the binding of adhesion receptors of the leukocyte (CD 18) to an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) on endothelium. Monoclonal antibodies to an ICAM can block leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. To determine the efficacy of anti-ICAM antibody treatment in preserving neurological function after CNS ischemia, two animal models were used. A 1-mg/kg dose of anti-ICAM was given to rabbits 30 minutes before induction of ischemia either in the spinal cord using temporary aortic occlusion or in the brain using intra-arterial microspheres. In this study, treatment with anti-ICAM produced a significant reduction in neurological deficits in the reversible spinal cord ischemia model but not in the irreversible brain ischemia model. This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in CNS reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy.\r"

This type arises along the course of the sixth cranial nerve in the prepontine area. Cavernous sinus involvement in either type may preclude total surgical excision and indicate an increase possibility for recurrence.\r"

In two patients the AVM's were totally removed without difficulty, and in one the AVM was managed conservatively after embolization. No new neurological deficits appeared during or after embolization. After road-mapping techniques, EVAL was injected slowly until the feeding artery and aneurysm were completely obliterated. This embolic agent is easy to handle and is considered safe compared with other adhesive liquid embolic agents, such as isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate or n-butyl cyanoacrylate. It is concluded that EVAL is an excellent agent for embolizing an AVM with a peripheral aneurysm on the feeding artery.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this prospective study was to define the patterns of recovery of mandibular mobility following three commonly performed orthognathic surgical procedures. Twenty-two consecutive patients undergoing either isolated Le Fort I osteotomy (LE FORT; n = 7), sagittal split ramus osteotomies (SSRO; n = 7), or intraoral vertical ramus osteotomies (IVRO; n = 9) were studied. LE FORT and SSRO patients had no mandibular immobilization, whereas IVRO patients were immobilized by dental fixation for 3 weeks. Mandibular mobility was assessed by measurement of maximal mandibular opening (MMO) and lateral and protrusive excursions. No significant difference in MMO was observed between groups prior to surgery (LE FORT, 47.0 mm; SSRO, 50.7 mm; IVRO, 54.5 mm). A significant reduction in MMO occurred immediately after surgery in the LE FORT and SSRO groups and at release of fixation in the IVRO group. Each group returned to presurgical levels of mandibular mobility at a different rate following surgery. LE FORT patients recovered quickly, regaining 83% (mean, 38.7 mm) of MMO by 1 month and exceeded preoperative levels (mean, 49.6 mm) by 6 months. SSRO patients showed hypomobility (mean, 23.5 mm) after 1 month, with significant improvement in MMO (mean, 38.0 mm) at 2 months, and nearly complete recovery (96.2%; mean, 48.8 mm) at 6 months. IVRO patients recovered rapidly after release of dental fixation, achieving 78% (mean, 39.8 mm) of preoperative MMO at 2 months. This study shows that significant differences in recovery patterns of mandibular mobility exist between surgical procedures. The clinician should be aware of these differences in recovery patterns in defining goals for individual patient rehabilitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred sixty mg of articaine hydrochloride (4.0 mL of a 4% articaine hydrochloride solution) with two different epinephrine doses was injected into outpatients prior to removal of an impacted mandibular third molar in a randomized, double-blind parallel group and crossover design. The results showed that the amount of epinephrine absorbed from the intraoral injection site predominantly determined the serum epinephrine concentration. The anesthetic-induced increase in the serum epinephrine level did not correlate with changes in the cardiohemodynamic parameters under study at any time during the operative procedure. The serum cAMP changes correlated with those of epinephrine, whereas the serum potassium levels remained unchanged. The procedure of tooth extraction was a stressful event when the 1:200,000 epinephrine-containing anesthetic solution was used, showing that the risk of inducing a cardiovascular incident during oral surgery seems to be higher the greater the extent of operation and the lower the epinephrine dose in the anesthetic solution.\r"

Multispace and single-space infections occurred with equal distribution. In both the multispace and single-space infections, the submandibular and buccal spaces were most frequently involved. Males were affected with single-space infections twice as often as females. An equal distribution among sexes was found in multispace infections. The most common age range for all infections was 25 to 30 years. alpha-Hemolytic streptococci, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Third molars were the prevalent cause in both multispace and single-space infections that required hospital admission.\r"

  ".W": "Trabecular bone remodeling during condylar fracture healing in the growing period was analyzed by histomorphometry with a synchronous system. Data from the study showed displacement of the fractured condyle was compensated by the changes in remodeling ascribed to the pubertal spurt of growth, and that such remodeling still continued even after clinical healing. The regional acceleratory phenomenon, evolved to potentiate tissue healing, was observed 1 week after induction of the fracture. Mesenchymal cells were presumably modulated into chondroblasts that promoted endochondral ossification. It was concluded that trabecular bone remodeling plays an important role in healing of condylar fractures during the growth period.\r"

Lung cancer risk for male smokers doubled, while the risk for females increased more than fourfold. On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157,000 of the 514,000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5% of all cancer deaths in women but 45% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced coronary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States.\r"

There was a general agreement of the Pst I and Sst I polymorphisms in any individual tumor, suggesting that they define two alleles in the human PgR locus, one being characterized by a deletion of about 300 base pairs with respect to the other. Both primary human breast tumor specimens (n = 36) and human term placentas (n = 48) displayed similar allele frequencies and typical mendelian distribution of these Pst I/Sst I alleles. The previously reported HindIII PgR RFLP was also investigated in 132 breast tumors. The HindIII PgR gene RFLP did not display typical mendelian distribution in the breast tumors; the factors affecting the HindIII allele frequencies are presently unknown. Neither the HindIII RFLP nor the deletion defined by Pst I and Sst I correlated with PgR expression as determined by a ligand-binding assay, suggesting that neither is related to the heterogeneity of PgR expression seen in breast tumors.\r"

In the first study, aphidicolin glycinate was given by 1-hour infusion for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks (daily x 5 study); in the second study, which was planned on the basis of the pharmacokinetic information obtained in the previous study, the drug was given by 24-hour continuous infusion. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. In the daily x 5 study, the daily dose was escalated from 12 mg/m2 to the maximum tolerated dose of 2250 mg/m2. Local toxicity was dose limiting. Elimination half-life was 2 +/- 0.2 hours (mean +/- SE) with aphidicolin being undetectable 6-8 hours after the end of the infusion. In the 24-hour continuous-infusion study, the dose was escalated from 435 mg/m2 to the maximum tolerated dose of 4500 mg/m2. Local toxicity was dose limiting, while other toxic effects were absent. The experimentally determined concentrations at the steady state were in agreement with those predicted on the basis of the available pharmacokinetic data. The targeted concentration at the steady state of 3 micrograms/mL was achieved at doses greater than or equal to 3000 mg/m2. Twenty-four-hour continuous infusion is the recommended schedule for clinical evaluations of aphidicolin glycinate as the synchronizing agent or in combination with cisplatin.\r"

  ".W": "7-Ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxy-camptothecin (CPT-11) is a novel camptothecin derivative that has been selected for clinical evaluation because of its broad spectrum of antitumor activity in animal models and its unique inhibitory effects on mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. Seventeen patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with CPT-11 at weekly dose levels ranging from 50 to 150 mg/m2. At least three weekly doses were given to all patients except four, and a total of 74 weekly doses were given to the 17 patients. The dose-limiting toxic effects were myelosuppression (predominantly leukopenia) and unpredictable diarrhea. Gastrointestinal toxic effects were severe and not well controlled by standard therapy in some patients. Interpatient variability of toxic effects was substantial (including two deaths) and did not correlate with the pharmacokinetic parameters of CPT-11 and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, its major metabolite. Two previously untreated patients, who received doses of 100 and 125 mg/m2, had partial responses lasting 3.2 and 4.0 months, respectively. The maximum tolerated dose on this schedule was 100 mg/m2, which we also recommend as a starting dose for phase II studies. This schedule appears to allow a CPT-11 dose intensity which is double the dose intensity possible on a once-a-month schedule. However, careful supervision to assess gastrointestinal toxic effects and myelosuppression is indispensable because of wide individual differences in drug tolerance.\r"

There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations). During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis. There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events. We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents.\r"

This article presents results on the incidence of contralateral new primary tumors among 1846 postmenopausal breast cancer patients included in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 2 or 5 years after surgery versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy. The median follow-up was 7 years (range, 3-13 years). There was a significant reduction of contralateral breast cancer in the 931 patients in the tamoxifen group versus that in the 915 control patients (29 versus 47 cases, respectively; P = .03). The cumulative incidence at 10 years in the tamoxifen group and the control group was 5% and 8%, respectively. Analysis of the relative hazard of contralateral tumor over time showed that the benefit with tamoxifen therapy was greatest during the first 1-2 years, but there was a continued risk reduction during the entire follow-up period, i.e., more than 10 years after cessation of treatment. There was no significant difference in the number of contralateral cancers in the patients randomly assigned to 2 or 5 years of treatment, but the 95% confidence interval of the relative hazard was wide. The proportion of estrogen receptor-negative contralateral breast cancers was higher in the tamoxifen group than in the control group. There was no difference, however, between the two groups in recurrence-free survival time from the diagnosis of the contralateral cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocyte-containing plasma subjected to photolysis in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (methoxsalen, 8-MOP) has previously been shown to be effective against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and the AIDS-related complex. The mechanism of this effect was thought to involve photoreaction of 8-MOP with DNA, based on certain in vitro experiments. The results of this study suggest a different mechanism. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from fresh human plasma was photosensitized by addition of 8-MOP and exposure to UV light (mp-LDL), and the reactions of the LDL lipids and the chemical actions induced by these reactions were monitored. In a separate procedure, LDL was peroxidized with hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase (p-LDL). mp-LDL and p-LDL were then tested in cytotoxicity assays on HuT-78 helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These results indicate that (a) LDL in plasma in the presence of very low concentrations of 8-MOP (200 ng/mL) can be peroxidized by UV light; (b) this photoperoxidized LDL is cytotoxic to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in a dose-dependent manner; but (c) it does not kill normal lymphocytes under similar conditions. The findings also suggest alternative therapeutic strategies for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as direct utilization of peroxidized LDL.\r"

We describe antibody inhibition studies showing that the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell-surface glycoprotein selectively expressed by cytokine-activated endothelial cells and responsible for neutrophil adhesion, is the major, if not the only, mediator of colon carcinoma cell adhesion to activated endothelial cells. Among the different tumor cell lines tested, seven colon carcinoma cell lines were sensitive to ELAM-1 antibodies. Adhesion of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and lung, cervix, or kidney carcinoma cell lines to IL-1-treated endothelial cells was not affected by the ELAM-1 antibody. This result suggests that ELAM-1 is selectively recognized by colon carcinoma cells and that adhesion of tumor cells to activated endothelial cells could be mediated by different and specific mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The assessment of physical activity at a single time to evaluate its association with cancer may be limited, since such a measure may not adequately reflect activity over the long term. To overcome this limitation, we studied 17,148 Harvard alumni aged 30-79 years who were followed prospectively for the occurrence of colon cancer (n = 225) and rectal cancer (n = 44) from 1965 through 1988. Physical activity, based on self-reported stair climbing, walking, and sports play, was assessed in either 1962 or 1966 (1962/1966) and again in 1977. The increased activity evaluated using either assessment (1962/1966 or 1977) taken alone was not associated with risk of colon cancer. However, alumni who were highly active (energy expenditure of greater than 2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had half the risk of developing colon cancer relative to those who were inactive (less than 1000 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments (age-adjusted rate ratio = 0.50; 90% confidence interval = 0.27-0.93), whereas those who were moderately active (1000-2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had an age-adjusted rate ratio of 0.52 (90% confidence interval = 0.28-0.94). We conclude that either consistently higher levels of activity are necessary to protect against colon cancer or combining two assessments increased the precision of physical activity measurement. We found no evidence that increased physical activity protected against rectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "L-Histidinol, a protein synthesis inhibitor and structural analogue of L-histidine, has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-treated mice to be cytoprotective to normal stem cells but to enhance cytotoxicity to tumor cells. N,N-Diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl) phenoxy]ethanamine.HCl (DPPE) is an antagonist of recently described microsomal and nuclear intracellular histamine receptors implicated in the mediation of proliferation and modulation of prostaglandin synthesis. DPPE is cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and cytoprotective to the gut in vivo. Noting the similar pharmacologic profiles for histidinol and DPPE and the structural resemblance between histidinol and histamine, we tested 1) whether binding to intracellular histamine receptors may be important to the action of histidinol, 2) whether there exists a differential effect of DPPE and histidinol on proliferating normal and transformed or malignant cells, and 3) whether DPPE, like histidinol, protects host cells from the effects of chemotherapy while augmenting tumor cell kill in vivo. It was observed that histidinol does compete at intracellular histamine receptors in isolated microsomes and nuclei, but with significantly lower affinity than DPPE. Nevertheless, for each agent, potency at intracellular histamine receptors correlates with potency to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis, without cytotoxicity, in normal mitogen-stimulated murine lymphocytes and to kill transformed mouse lymphocytes or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. As demonstrated previously for histidinol (1-2 g/kg), DPPE (4 mg/kg) protected murine bone marrow progenitors from doxorubicin or fluorouracil, while doses of 4-50 mg/kg significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and daunorubicin in murine models of early cancer. One postulate to explain the effects of intracellular histamine receptor ligands is that intracellular histamine mediates DNA and protein synthesis, possibly through a downward modulation of growth-inhibitory prostaglandin levels. Antagonism of the intracellular action of histamine at intracellular histamine receptors by DPPE or histidinol may result in differential perturbations of growth/eicosanoid metabolism in normal and malignant cells, thus forming the basis of a new approach to chemotherapy.\r"

SETTING.--Kigali, Rwanda. PARTICIPANTS.--A representative sample of 1458 childbearing women aged 19 to 37 years who were recruited from outpatient prenatal and pediatric clinics at the only community hospital in the city. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE.--Antibodies to HIV assessed by enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS.--The HIV seroprevalence was 32% overall. Infection rates were higher in women who were single, in those in steady relationships that began after 1981, and in the 33% of women reporting more than one lifetime sexual partner. Women in legal marriages or monogamous partnerships had lower rates of infection, but even low-risk women had prevalences on the order of 20%. History of venereal disease in the past 5 years, although the strongest risk factor in a multiple logistic analysis (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 3.7), was reported by only 30% of those infected. Having a male sexual partner who drank alcohol or who had higher income were significant risk factors for HIV infection in the multivariate analysis, but use of oral contraceptives and having an uncircumcised partner were not. CONCLUSIONS.--The epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Rwanda has spread beyond high-risk groups to the general population of women without known risk factors. For most of these women, a steady male partner is the source of their HIV risk and therefore a vital target for intervention efforts.\r"

DESIGN.--Survey of infected individuals and their heterosexual partners recruited since 1985. SETTING.--Participants were recruited from various HIV counseling and testing sites throughout California but were generally interviewed and tested in their homes. PARTICIPANTS.--Data from 379 couples at entry to the study are reported: 72 male partners of infected women and 307 female partners of infected men. The infected index case had a well-established source of risk; couples were eliminated if the direction of transmission could not be established. The majority of couples were monogamous since 1978, white, and in their 30s. Most partners did not know their serostatus at entry into the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE.--HIV serostatus in the exposed sexual partner. RESULTS.--We observed one probable instance (1%) of female-to-male transmission compared with 20% transmission rates in the female partners of infected men. All couples were sampled in the same way. Male index cases were more likely to be symptomatic than female index cases. CONCLUSION.--The odds of male-to-female transmission were significantly greater than female-to-male transmission. The one case of female-to-male transmission was unique in that the couple reported numerous unprotected sexual contacts and noted several instances of vaginal and penile bleeding during intercourse.\r"

The purpose of this study was to classify the mechanisms of glove tears and sharp injuries in the operating room. DESIGN.--During a 3-month period, a nurse interviewed operating room personnel immediately after a glove tear or sharp injury had occurred. SETTING.--Yale-New Haven (Conn) Hospital is a tertiary care teaching hospital. RESULTS.--There were 249 glove tears and 70 sharp injuries. Visible skin contact with the patient's blood occurred in 156 glove tears (63%). The mechanism causing the tear could be identified in only 81 (33%). For 230 glove tears (92%), personnel were wearing single gloves. Of 70 sharp injuries, 47 (67%) were caused by needles and usually occurred during suturing. The following three mechanisms accounted for 40 sharp injuries (57%): (1) hands injured while stationary and holding an instrument, 11 (16%)-a position of risk not previously identified; (2) hands injured while retracting tissue, 12 (17%); and (3) injuries caused by sharp instruments not being used, 17 (24%). Instrument passage caused only four sharp injuries (6%). CONCLUSIONS.--The majority of glove tears have an unknown mechanism, and alteration in the manufacture or number of gloves worn may be helpful in reducing cutaneous blood exposures. The identification of specific mechanisms of sharp injuries should lead to effective strategies to prevent exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus and other blood-borne pathogens in the operating room.\r"

DESIGN AND METHOD.-Patients were evaluated by echocardiogram from 4 to 20 years (median, 7 years) after completion of anthracyclines, with prospective and retrospective analysis. PATIENTS.--The consecutive sample of 201 patients had received a total anthracycline dose of 200 to 1275 mg/m2 (median, 450 mg/m2), and 51 patients had mediastinal radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The overall incidence and severity of abnormal systolic cardiac function were determined for the entire cohort. Risk factors of total anthracycline dose, mediastinal radiotherapy, age during treatment, and length of follow-up were examined. RESULTS.--Twenty-three percent (47/201) of the cohort had abnormal cardiac function on noninvasive testing at long-term follow-up. Correlation between total cumulative dose, length of follow-up, and mediastinal irradiation with incidence of abnormalities was significant. Fifty-six patients were followed up for 10 years or more (median, 12 years), with a median anthracycline dose of 495 mg/m2. Thirty-eight percent (21/56) of these patients, compared with 18% (26/145) of patients evaluated after less than 10 years, had abnormal findings. Sixty-three percent of patients followed up for 10 years or more after receiving 500 mg/m2 or more of anthracyclines had abnormal findings. Nine of 201 patients had late symptoms, including cardiac failure and dysrhythmia, and three patients died suddenly. Microscopic examination of the myocardium on biopsy and autopsy revealed fibrosis. CONCLUSION.--The 23% incidence of late cardiac abnormalities warrants continued evaluation of patients after anthracyclines to guide patient care and the design of future chemotherapeutic protocols.\r"

Using data on the within-individual and population variance of serum cholesterol, we addressed the following clinical concerns: Given a cholesterol measurement, what is the individual's likely true level? The confidence interval for the true level is wide and asymmetrical around extreme measurements because of regression to the mean. Of particular concern is the misclassification of people with a screening measurement below 5.2 mmol/L who may be advised that their cholesterol level is \"desirable\" when their true level warrants further action To what extent does blood cholesterol change in response to an intervention? In general, confidence intervals are too wide to allow decision making and patient feedback about an individual's cholesterol response to a dietary intervention, even with multiple measurements. If no change is observed in an individual's cholesterol value based on three measurements before and three after dietary intervention, the 80% confidence interval ranges from a true increase of 4% to a true decrease of 9%.\r"

DATA SOURCES - Investigations of these treatments in animal models, healthy human volunteers, and patients with sepsis and related disorders. STUDY SELECTION - Particular attention was paid to studies of patients with sepsis and related disorders, especially randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION - Animal studies and investigations with human volunteers were judged by how closely the experimental model replicated the clinical disorder (sepsis). Patient trials were assessed by sample size and design. Results of all studies were used to evaluate the likelihood that a given treatment would reduce mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS - Direct comparison of E5 and HA-1A antibody studies is difficult because of differences in their design, definitions of shock, and methods of subgroup analysis. However, both antibodies improve outcome in some subgroups: E5 benefits patients with gram-negative infection (bacteremic or focal) who do not have refractory shock, and HA-1A benefits those with gram-negative bacteremia (regardless of whether shock is present) but not those with focal gram-negative infection. Two agents that may be beneficial in gram-positive and gram-negative infection are monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha and receptor antagonists to interleukin 1. Preliminary results with both are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS - All three types of treatment may improve outcome in sepsis. The best results will probably be obtained with combination therapy that interrupts multiple points of the inflammatory cascade underlying sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "After the initial description of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Romania in late 1989, national AIDS case surveillance was established with a modified version of the World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical case definition. This modified case definition requires that AIDS cases have both clinical and serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Before December, 1989, Romania had reported 13 AIDS cases to WHO. By Dec 31, 1990, 1168 AIDS cases were reported to Romania's Ministry of Health, of which 1094 (93.7%) occurred in children less than 13 years of age at diagnosis. Of these, 1086 (99.3%) were in infants and children less than 4 years of age, and 683 (62.4%) in abandoned children living in public institutions at the time of diagnosis. By Dec 31, 1990, 493 (45.1%) mothers of children with AIDS had been located and tested, and 37 (7.5%) were positive for HIV; 423 (38.7%) cases were in children who had received transfusions of unscreened blood, and 6 (0.5%) were in children with clotting disorders. HIV transmission through the improper use of needles and syringes is strongly suspected in most of the remaining 628 (57.4%) children with AIDS, most of whom had received multiple therapeutic injections. This outbreak demonstrates the serious potential for HIV transmission in medical facilities that intensively and improperly use parenteral therapy and have poor sterilisation technique.\r"

  ".W": "Microbial keratitis is a potentially binding disease that is rare in normal eyes unless associated with contact lens (CL) wear. To assess the risks of CL use, and other major causes, for keratitis, a case-control study of 91 cases of keratitis including 60 CL users was done. Relative risks (RR) and population attributable risk percentages (PAR%) for keratitis were estimated for different causes and for the different types of CL. The RR (95% confidence intervals) for CL wear was 80 (38-166) and for trauma cases 14 (6-32) compared with cases of keratitis without a predisposing condition. The PAR% for microbial keratitis attributed to CL wear was 65%. The RR for overnight wear soft lenses was 21 (7-60), for daily-wear soft lenses 3.6 (1-14), and for polymethylmethacrylate hard lenses 1.3 (0-9) compared with gas-permeable hard lenses. Continuous periods of CL wear for more than 6 days was associated with increased risk. CL wear is now the commonest cause, and has the highest risk, for new cases of microbial keratitis at Moorfields Eye Hospital. Soft CLs, especially extended-wear lenses, carry a significantly higher risk than do hard lenses for this disease.\r"

  ".U": "91359741\r", 
  ".W": "Type-1 or reversal reactions are the major cause of nerve damage and disability in leprosy. We wished to determine whether there were any clinical or laboratory markers that identified patients with an increased risk of type-1 reaction. 42 (31%) of 136 Nepalese borderline leprosy patients (97 male, 39 female; age range 7-73 years) had a type-1 reaction during the first 2 years of multi-drug therapy. Before therapy, 41 (98%) of the 42 patients were seropositive for antibodies to one of three mycobacterial antigens. Seropositivity for IgM antiphenolic-glycolipid-1 (PGL-1) antibodies, but not IgG anti-lipoarabinomannan or anti-Mycobacterium leprae 35 kDa protein antibodies, was significantly associated with subsequent manifestation of a type-1 reaction (p less than 0.001). The concentration of IgM anti-PGL-1 antibodies in serum was significantly higher in patients in whom a type-1 reaction developed. The risk attributable to anti-PGL-1 seropositivity was independent of leprosy class, skin smear positivity, and the presence of other anti-M leprae antibodies (adjusted odds ratio = 8.7, p less than 0.001). In the 87 patients who had a lepromin test, anti-PGL-1 seropositivity and lepromin reactivity were significant independent risk factors for subsequent reaction. 78% of patients with positive lepromin reactivity and IgM anti-PGL-1 antibodies had type-1 reactions. Patients with these risk factors should be carefully monitored during antimicrobial therapy to permit early initiation of anti-inflammatory treatment thus minimising permanent nerve damage and resultant disability.\r"

  ".U": "91359742\r", 
  ".W": "It has been postulated that an infectious agent and/or specific sexual behaviour is involved in the aetiology of anal cancer, in analogy with the aetiology established for cancer of the cervix. A case-control study of 29,648 women with cancers registered in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968-87 tested the hypothesis that anal cancer patients were more likely than patients with colon, stomach, or vulva cancer to have had a previous diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer. The odds ratio of CIN, adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, for anal vs colon cancer was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-8.3), that for anal vs stomach cancer 3.6 (2.1-6.0), and that for anal vs vulva cancer 1.6 (0.9-2.9). The median time from diagnosis of CIN to diagnosis of the registered cancer was 151 months for anal, 112 months for vulva, 114 months for colon, and 126 months for stomach cancer. The association with previous invasive cervical cancer was also investigated; no patient with cervical cancer in this second analysis had been included in the CIN analysis. The odds ratios were similar. In addition, anal cancer patients were significantly more likely to have had cervical cancer than were patients with vulva cancer (odds ratio 1.8 [1.0-3.9]). The strong association between anal cancer and CIN/invasive cervical cancer suggests that these cancers share common risk factors. The association is at least as strong as that between cervical and vulva cancer.\r"

During the first days of the Gulf war we noted a sharp rise in the incidence of acute MI and sudden death in our area compared with five control periods. Patient population in the various study periods did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, hospital mortality, or proportion of patients in whom the acute event was the first presentation of coronary disease. However, during the first period of the war there were more cases of anterior wall MI and more patients received thrombolytic therapy than during control periods. Despite the continuing missile threat, the incidence of acute MI reverted to normal after the initial phase of the Gulf war.\r"

The presence of DR3/DRw52a or anti-Scl-70 gives a relative risk of 16.7 for the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a patient with scleroderma--a risk substantial enough to require careful monitoring of these patients and treatment at an early stage of disease.\r"

  ".W": "This article presents the first results of the Dutch nationwide study on euthanasia and other medical decisions concerning the end of life (MDEL). The study was done at the request of the Dutch government in preparation for a discussion about legislation on euthanasia. Three studies were undertaken: detailed interviews with 405 physicians, the mailing of questionnaires to the physicians of a sample of 7000 deceased persons, and the collecting of information about 2250 deaths by a prospective survey among the respondents to the interviews. The alleviation of pain and symptoms with such high dosages of opioids that the patient's life might be shortened was the most important MDEL in 17.5% of all deaths. In another 17.5% a non-treatment decision was the most important MDEL. Euthanasia by administering lethal drugs at the patient's request seems to have been done in 1.8% of all deaths. Since MDEL were taken in 38% of all deaths (and in 54% of all non-acute deaths) we conclude that these decisions are common medical practice and should get more attention in research, teaching, and public debate.\r"

Urine can readily be obtained by compression of wet nappy fibres within a 20 ml syringe if highly absorbent brands that contain gel beads are avoided. Red and white cell numbers were reduced on light microscopy of specimens obtained from nappies, but bacterial counts were unchanged. On culture, 6 children were shown to have urinary tract infections by both methods; of the children who did not have a urine infection, the contamination rate was lower from nappy collections (10/39 vs 17/39 from urine bags). Biochemical analysis of urine collected from 11 older children showed very close correlation for sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine concentrations and osmolality between freshly voided urine and samples obtained after they were soaked into disposable nappies for 3 h and reclaimed, although there was greater variation for measurements of calcium and phosphate. Extraction of urine from disposable nappies put on within 4 h and which are not soiled by faeces is an inexpensive, rapid, and simple method to collect urine from young children for culture, microscopy for bacteria, and biochemical analysis.\r"

Inexperience with equipment and shortage of trained staff were the factors most often felt to contribute to incidents. The critical incident technique is a useful way of improving standards of clinical care.\r"

The feasibility of different intraluminal expandable endotracheal stents for the treatment of surgically induced tracheomalacia was analyzed in 27 piglets. A potentially fatal tracheomalacia was surgically created. Either a stainless steel \"zig-zag\" stent or a woven polymeric stent was then implanted. Tracheal patency, mucosal function, histopathologic respiratory tract changes, and effects of the stent on esophageal motility were evaluated over a 16-week period. Piglets with steel stents uniformly experienced intense inflammation leading to tracheal dysfunction and death. Piglets with polymeric stents experienced minimal respiratory symptoms. Expandable polymeric endotracheal stents alleviate surgically induced piglet tracheomalacia, were easy to insert, allowed for tracheal growth, and reduced the need for high-risk surgical procedures with prolonged ventilatory support.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the recognized ototoxicity of cis-platinum, a clinical outline for the audiologic evaluation of patients receiving this drug has not been clearly defined. In a practical approach to this problem, the audiograms of 48 pediatric patients referred for monitoring during planned cis-platinum therapy were reviewed. Eleven patients tested with auditory brain-stem response (ABR) audiometry demonstrated several limitations of this modality. Fourteen children underwent initial ABR testing followed by at least two pure-tone audiograms. The remaining 23 patients had their hearing evaluated by pure-tone audiometry only. Various factors such as patient age, cis-platinum dosage, and cranial radiation exposure were analyzed for apparent effect. Younger patients tended to be more susceptible to audiologic changes with the administration of cis-platinum. The proportion of patients who demonstrated a hearing loss increased with successive dosing as did the severity of the hearing loss. Prior exposure to cranial radiation was strongly linked to the development of hearing loss following cis-platinum therapy. Guidelines are presented regarding the use of clinical audiometry in the screening of these pediatric oncology patients.\r"

The treatment of these tumors has evolved, and recent introduction of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the diagnosis of very small intracanalicular acoustic tumors before hearing has been significantly affected. For such tumors, some surgeons advocate the premicrosurgical philosophy of observation rather than removal. Our results of small acoustic tumor removal with attempt at hearing preservation were reviewed. From 1961 to June 1989, 39 acoustic tumors 0.5 cm or less were removed by the middle fossa approach. Measurable hearing was preserved in 67%, and facial function 1 year postoperatively was normal or nearly normal in 97%. There was no other permanent operative morbidity. Given our results, early surgical removal of small acoustic tumors is advocated.\r"

A retrospective review of 247 laryngectomies performed between 1979 and 1989 was undertaken to determine specific intraoperative indications for thyroid gland removal. The incidence of thyroid disease in our patients with laryngeal cancer was compared to the normal population. Eight percent of thyroid specimens removed during laryngeal cancer surgery demonstrated invasion by squamous cell carcinoma. All patients having thyroid invasion had T3 or T4 laryngeal lesions that were stage IV at the time of surgery. All these lesions were found to have transglottic growth and laryngeal cartilage invasion by the pathologist. All of these patients also had abnormal thyroid glands intraoperatively and laryngeal cartilage destruction that was evident intraoperatively. Total thyroidectomy with bilateral paratracheal and pretracheal lymph node dissection is indicated when squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx involves the thyroid gland. Prophylactic ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy is warranted for large laryngeal cancers (T3, T4) that involve the anterior commissure, the subglottic area, or extend transglottically. Routine thyroid gland removal is not indicated for the majority of laryngeal cancers that do not meet the aforementioned criteria. Finally, abnormal thyroid histopathology was diagnosed in 37% of the surgical thyroid gland specimens removed during laryngectomy.\r"

Stable and retentive dental restorations have been achieved using enosseous implants placed directly into the vascularized bone flaps. However, the functional assessment of patients who underwent primary mandibular reconstruction with these techniques has not been previously reported. A group of 10 reconstructed and 10 nonreconstructed segmental hemimandibulectomy patients were compared using a battery of tests to assess their overall well-being, cosmesis, deglutition, oral competence, speech, length of hospitalization, and dental rehabilitation. In addition, objective measures of the masticatory apparatus (interincisal opening, bite force, chewing performance, and chewing stroke) were used to compare these two groups as well as normal healthy subjects and edentulous patients restored with conventional and implant-borne dentures. The results show a clear advantage for the reconstructed patients in almost all categories. Persistent problems and future directions in oromandibular reconstruction are discussed.\r"

Spread of toxin from the injected muscle has been suggested as an etiology. This study examines how botulinum toxin crosses muscle fascia by a novel method of quantifying muscular paralysis. Botulinum toxin (0.2 to 10 U) was placed onto the fascia of rat tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (n = 6). Toxin was also placed on dose-matched muscles that had their fascia surgically removed (n = 6). Twenty-four hours later, the nerve to the tibialis anterior was electrically stimulated to deplete the muscle fibers of glycogen. Toxin-paralyzed fibers retained their glycogen and appeared purple on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. Botulinum toxin easily passed through muscle fascia even at subclinical doses. The presence of fascia reduced the spread of botulinum toxin by 23%. These results suggest that spread of botulinum toxin can be prevented only by delivering small doses to the center of a target muscle.\r"

DPOEs and click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOEs) were measured from a same group of normal and hearing-impaired children (age 4 through 10 years) and normal adults (age 22 through 29 years). Measurements of DPOEs in 13 children's ears with normal hearing showed higher levels of emissions in the 700- to 1400-Hz and 5.7-kHz regions relative to the data obtained in 10 normal adult ears. The 22 ears of children with sensorineural hearing loss demonstrated agreement between pure-tone audiograms and \"DPOE audiograms.\" Measurements of CEOEs revealed that the average level of emission in 15 normal-hearing children's ears was slightly lower than that previously obtained in newborns, but slightly higher than that of adults. In children, the CEOE spectral components in the 4- to 6-kHz region were lower than in newborns, but higher than in adults. These results support the view that the DPOEs and CEOEs comprise a valuable tool in assessment of cochlear function in subjects of all ages.\r"

A telephone questionnaire was administered to 73 patients who had been previously screened for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). The incidence of epistaxis in this population was 93%, with a mean onset age of epistaxis of 12 years, a mean frequency of bleeding of 18 episodes per month, and a mean duration of bleeding of 7.5 minutes. More than 90% of patients experienced the onset of epistaxis before the age of 21 and symptoms were progressive with age. There were no differences in the age of onset, frequency of epistaxis, or duration of epistaxis between patients with PAVMs versus those without PAVMs. Although the natural history of epistaxis does not predict the presence or absence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, epistaxis is an early marker of the disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and might guide screening for pulmonary and cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children of affected parents.\r"

A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2. Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity. A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss. Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2).\r"

A cartilage capsule surrounds the nose at 8 weeks and by 9 weeks, medially directed flanges of cartilage have invaded all three preturbinates. The uncinate process arises from the medial surface of the lateral cartilaginous capsule and is first identifiable by 10 weeks. An \"air space\" progressively develops from 11 to 12 weeks lateral to the cartilaginous uncinate process and from this space, the embryonic channel to the maxillary sinus develops. The embryonic woven bone of the maxilla can be identified from 9 to 10 weeks and enlarges both absolutely and relatively to the nasal cavity, so that by 13 to 14 weeks, this expanding bone forms the lateral wall of the inferior meatus as the cartilaginous nasal capsule regresses.\r"

  ".W": "This review examines the potential for an exercise-induced increase in coronary collateral circulation, with specific reference to the role and functional significance of collateral vessels, highlighting animal and human studies in particular, and their inherent methodological limitations. Exercise training may enhance myocardial oxygen supply by promoting transient periods of myocardial ischemia, a potent trigger of collateral growth. Some human studies have shown that moderate-to-high intensity training can result in a higher double product at the onset of angina and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, suggesting that myocardial oxygen supply has increased. Attempts to use thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy to assess myocardial perfusion before and after a physical training program have produced conflicting data, whereas angiographic studies in group trials have, without exception, yielded disappointing results. Thus, direct evidence that exercise stimulates collateralization in humans is lacking.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise training elicits numerous beneficial adaptations in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but until 10 yr ago these adaptations were generally believed to be peripheral adaptations rather than improvements in myocardial blood supply. However, animal models of CAD have been shown to elicit improvements in myocardial blood flow and left ventricular performance with prolonged, intense exercise training. More recently we have provided electrocardiographic, echocardiographic hemodynamic, and radionuclide evidence of central cardiovascular adaptations in patients with CAD after a year-long program of 1 h of exercise at 70-90% of VO2max 5 d.wk(-1). These training-induced adaptations are consistent with an improvement in myocardial oxygenation and concomitantly an enhanced left ventricular function in these patients. This program also resulted in improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile. We have also shown that these beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations are maintained during six additional years of training in patients with CAD. These results do not imply that all patients with CAD should initiate such an intense training program, but rather that, in selected patients undergoing a training stimulus well in excess of that conventionally prescribed for coronary patients, the training-induced adaptations may be substantially greater than previously believed.\r"

On the basis of these and other existing studies, it is possible to draw the following conclusions and to make the following tentative recommendations for patients engaged in exercise training who receive beta-blocker therapy: i) CAD patients treated with beta-blockers are capable of deriving the expected enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness during training, irrespective of the type of drug used; ii) beta1-selective blockers are preferable to nonselective agents for hypertensive patients engaged in exercise training; iii) because beta1-selective blockers impair exercise tolerance in some hypertensive patients, physicians should look out for this adverse reaction and, if present, consider alternative antihypertensive therapy; iv) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity confers no advantage during exercise training; v) exercise intensity prescription for patients receiving beta-blockers should be in accordance with traditional guidelines and based on results of individualized exercise testing performed on medication; vi) exercise training is desirable during beta-blocker therapy in that it appears to offset adverse alterations in lipoprotein metabolism; and vii) nonselective beta-blockers may increase predisposition to exertional hyperthermia, and patients must therefore be encouraged to adhere strictly to accepted guidelines for heat injury prevention.\r"

Improvement in lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and subclass distribution through exercise training is often advised prior to pharmacologic intervention. As with other therapeutic interventions, dose must be stipulated to the patient. The dose of exercise training required to induce beneficial lipoprotein changes is unclear. This issue is further complicated by the potential effect of exercise training on lipoprotein subclass distribution (LDL I, LDL II, LDL III, LDL IV, HDL2a, HDL2b, HDL3a, HDL3b, HDL3c), enzymes, apoproteins, and transfer proteins and by the changes in diet and body composition that often accompany exercise training. These changes may be responsible for all or part of the lipoprotein change attributed to exercise. From available data, it appears that a threshold of approximately 15 miles.wk(-1) of jogging may be required to induce beneficial change.\r"

  ".U": "91359859\r", 
  ".W": "During the last decade, cardiac transplantation has become the accepted form of treatment for selected patients with end-stage heart disease, which usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. Although 5-yr survival is currently 85%, patients have complicated courses after surgery, with an ever present risk of infection and graft rejection. Because of physical inactivity and severe limitation of cardiac output preoperatively, these deconditioned patients are excellent candidates for medically supervised rehabilitative exercise training programs. Denervation of the myocardium, which occurs with cardiac transplantation, results in a loss of autonomic nervous system modulation of cardiac output, with reliance on circulating catecholamines and with a delayed heart rate and cardiac output response to the onset of exercise. Oxygen uptake kinetics are prolonged, and maximal oxygen uptake is reduced. Additional abnormalities in cardiac and pulmonary artery pressures and in ventilation during exercise have been described. The literature contains seven studies concerning the effects of exercise training in cardiac transplant recipients. Benefits resulting from training include increases in maximal oxygen uptake, peak exercise power output, anaerobic threshold, and lean body mass, reduced perceived exertion, heart rate, and blood pressure during submaximal exercise, and a lowered resting heart rate and blood pressure. There are no data to suggest that exercise training alters the incidence of infection or rejection or improves longevity or return to pre-illness lifestyle.\r"

The literature is inconclusive as to whether there is an association between total and LDL cholesterol and exercise. Further, previous work has, almost exclusively, examined male runners. Therefore, we examined 176 male and female cross-country skiers, participating in the National Master's Championships, for body composition, dietary habits, exercise habits, and serum lipid levels. Our results show markedly low concentrations of serum LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, as well as the expected high concentrations of HDL cholesterol and low concentrations of triglycerides, in these lean skiers. Their diets contained 30% fat, and they exercised 9 h weekly. Although it is difficult to separate the effects of diet, leanness, and exercise on the lipid profile, it is apparent that the lifestyle led by these people is associated with a lipid profile that confers an extremely low risk of atherosclerotic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise training has potential benefits for patients with hyperlipidemia and/or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. In nondiabetic, nonobese subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, exercise training alone increased insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance, and lowered serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. These improvements did not occur when exercise training alone was given to similar patients with impaired glucose tolerance. In severely obese (X = 125 kg) subjects without diabetes melitus, a 600 calorie diet alone decreased glucose and insulin concentrations and improved glucose tolerance but did not increase insulin sensitivity. The addition of exercise training improved insulin sensitivity. Obese, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus subjects on sulfonylurea therapy alone increased insulin levels but failed to improve insulin sensitivity or glucose levels. In contrast, the addition of exercise training to this medication resulted in improved insulin sensitivity and lowered glucose levels. We conclude that exercise training has major effects on lowering triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemic subjects and can potentiate the effect of diet or drug therapy on glucose metabolism in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Ten subjects ingested either a water placebo (WP) or carbohydrate solutions formulated to provide glucose at the rates of 26, 52, and 78 g, h-1 during 2 h of cycling exercise in a cool (10 degrees C) environment. Beverages were administered in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. A 4.8 km performance test followed each 2 h session. The average time required to complete the performance test was less with the carbohydrate feedings than with WP: mean (+/- SE) for WP = 505.0 +/- 18.7 s. 26 g.h(-1) = 476.0* +/- 8.8 s. 52 g.h(-1) = 483.8 +/- 12.7 s. 78 g.h(-1) = 474.3* +/- 19.1 s; *P less than 0.05 vs WP. Carbohydrate feeding resulted in higher plasma glucose and insulin, and lower free fatty acid concentrations than did WP. Changes in plasma osmolality, plasma volume, rectal temperature, lactate, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, ratings of perceived exertion, and sensory responses were similar among beverage treatments. Compared with WP, ingestion of the glucose beverages minimized changes in plasma ACTH and cortisol. In summary, carbohydrate feeding at the rates of 26 and 78 g.h(-1) was associated with improved exercise performance. The data further indicate that a dose-response relationship does not exist between the amount of carbohydrate consumed during exercise and exercise performance.\r"

  ".W": "The ventilatory stimulating effects of hypoxia occurring at carotid bodies are potentiated by exercise. However, hypoxia also has central ventilatory depressive effects; the potential interactions between this hypoxic depression and exercise have not been studied. We examined the ventilatory response to a 20 min period of isocapnic hypoxia (end-tidal O2, PETO2, of 50 mm Hg), preceded and followed by a 5 min period of isocapnic hyperoxia in seven normal adult males at rest and during moderate exercise (45-75 W). When hypoxia was introduced at rest (PETO2 = 42 mmHg), ventilation initially increased from 13.73 +/- 3.04 (mean +/- SD) to 23.69 +/- 5.48 1.min-1 and then slowly declined to 19.01 +/- 4.68 1 min-1. The increase was caused by increases in tidal volume and respiratory frequency, but the decline was solely in tidal volume. During a background of moderate exercise (PETCO2 = 46 mmHg), introduction of hypoxia caused ventilation to increase from 30.84 +/- 6.31 to 56.44 +/- 10.58 1.min-1. Ventilation subsequently did not decline; at the end of the hypoxic period, ventilation was 57.06 +/- 12.59 1.min-1. The increase was also associated with an increase in tidal volume and respiratory frequency, as seen as rest, but with much larger magnitudes. Despite the absence of ventilatory decline, there was still a decline in tidal volume, but it was compensated by an increase in respiratory frequency. We conclude that exercise potentiated the acute ventilatory response to hypoxia by modifying both tidal volume and respiratory frequency but that exercise abolished or greatly reduced hypoxic decline by increasing respiratory rate.\r"

Subjects (ages 20-34 yr) were monitored during treadmill running, five times a week (Monday through Friday) for 4 wk, at 2.68, 3.13, and 3.58 m, s-1. Tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion, and a total mood disturbance (TMD) score were assessed every Friday prior to the treadmill running sessions. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was determined via the open-circuit method during each of the three running paces. VO2 values were averaged over 5 d and three speeds for each week (RE) and were correlated with the weekly TMD scores, resulting in a nonsignificant group correlation of r = -0.28. The within-subject group correlation between TMD scores and RE was r = 0.88. This positive correlation indicates that, when the focus of attention was on within-subject variation, weeks featuring more economical values were associated with more positive mental health profiles. Correlations between average VO2 and the six POMS subscales were tension. r = 0.81; depression, r = 0.73; anger, r = 0.58; vigor, r = -0.60: fatigue, r = 0.18; and confusion, r = 0.60. All correlation coefficients except for fatigue were significantly (P less than 0.01) related to average VO2. In conclusion, it appears that short-term fluctuations in RE of moderately trained male runners are closely tied to their mood state.\r"

Two test sessions consisting of both treadmill and track exercise were performed in a rotated order to control for sequential effects. All subjects exercised according to an identical protocol: two successive trials (3 min each) at RPE 11 (light exertion), followed by a RPE 13 (somewhat hard) trial (11 min) and, finally, a RPE 15 (hard) trial (5 min). Results show significantly different levels of heart rate (HR), blood lactate, and velocity at the three RPE levels. Large differences were also observed in all measured variables between field and laboratory. These differences were consistent over time. A high internal consistency, measured by test-retest reliability (alpha greater than 0.9), was obtained for both velocity and HR between the first two trials at RPE 11. In conclusion, the RPE method functioned well as a means of monitoring and regulating exercise intensity.\r"

Despite no changes in treadmill VO2max or cycle peak VO2, a 33 +/- 5% increase (P less than 0.001) in cycling time to exhaustion at 75% of peak VO2 was observed following training. No significant changes in cycling time were observed in the control group. There were significant reductions in plasma lactate concentration at all relative exercise intensities ranging between 55 and 75% of peak VO2 training. The improved endurance performance was associated with a 12% increase in LT (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). The strength training program resulted in significant improvements (P less than 0.001) of 31 +/- 5% and 35 +/- 7% in isokinetic peak torque values for leg extension and flexion, respectively, at a velocity of 30 degrees.s-1. There were also significant increases in 1-RM values of 30 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001) for leg extension, 52 +/- 6% (P less than 0.001) for leg flexion, and 20 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001) for the bench press. These findings indicate that strength training improves cycle endurance performance independently of changes in VO2max. This improved performance appears to be related to increases in LT and leg strength.\r"

VO2max (l.min-1) was measured during a progressive tethered swim test and was also estimated from a 20 s sample of expired air collected immediately after an all-out, 549 m (600 yard) swim. On different days, each subject performed two 549 m trials at 95% of his maximal swim velocity, one with drafting and one without drafting, using a counter-balanced design. Underwater pace lights were used to establish the predetermined swim velocity. Drafting significantly reduced post-exercise VO2 (2.85 +/- 0.63 vs 3.12 +/- 0.66 l.min-1), blood lactate (3.4 +/- 0.6 vs 5.0 +/- 0.5 mM), and rating of perceived exertion (11.7 +/- 0.4 vs 14.9 +/- 0.5) (P less than 0.05). A repeated measures ANOVA (condition X distance) also revealed significant reductions in HR during the 549 m swim (137.7 vs 146.8 beats.min-1) (P less than 0.05).

Cycling leg work was adjusted in order to produce a constant 60% and 75% of MHRR during WW and NW sessions. The results revealed that during both exercises the cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic responses were similar. However, during the NW sessions lactic acid (LA) levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those observed during WW sessions (3.2 +/- 0.9 and 5.4 +/- 1.5 mm.l-1, vs 2.9 +/- 0.9 and 3.8 +/- 1.3 mm.-1), as were ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (13.2 +/- 1 and 14.4 +/- 0.6, vs 12.2 +/- 1 and 13.4 +/- 1.5). These data indicated a similar pattern of hemodynamic and respiratory responses to NW and WW cycling exercises, while LA and RPE were lower in WW cycling. It is therefore suggested that arm swing with wrist weights may be a beneficial mode of exercise, distributing the workload on a larger muscle mass while maintaining the target heart rate. Thus, it enables a lower reliance on anaerobic metabolism and a lower perceived exertion.\r"

VO2max increased only in the Ex group (16%; P less than 0.001). We conclude that healthy septuagenarian women can increase aerobic capacity, leg strength, and Type IIb muscle fiber area with a long-duration, combined aerobic-resistance exercise program.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the current investigation was to evaluate, using multiple measures of physical activity, the relationships among physical activity, body composition, resting heart rate, and blood pressure in an adult population. Subjects were 221 male (135 normal weight, 86 overweight) and 221 female (156 normal weight, 65 overweight) subjects participating in a longitudinal study of cardiovascular risk factors in families. All subjects were administered three physical activity questionnaires. Principal components analyses were conducted to reduce measures into empirically derived subscales; this analysis revealed five stable factors in men and four in women. Results indicated that aerobic/leisure time significantly correlated to body composition and resting heart rate in both men and women. Additionally, aerobic/leisure time activity was related to blood pressure in women, and moderate activity was related positively to blood pressure in men. No other form of activity (e.g., light activity, anaerobic activity) was related to either adiposity or blood pressure. The implications of these results are discussed, and future research directions are highlighted.\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of this study were to validate the 12-min swim as a field test of VO2max and to compare its validity with that of the 12-min run. Thirty-six young men completed 12-min swim, 12-min run, tethered swimming (TS) VO2peak, and treadmill running (TR) VO2peak tests within 3 wk. Mean (+/- SD) 12-min swim and run distances were 581 +/- 88 and 2797 +/- 290 m, and mean TS and TR VO2peak values were 50.3 +/- 6.2 and 57.2 +/- 5.5 ml.kg BW-1.min-1, respectively. Correlation coefficients and standard errors of estimate for predictions of TS VO2peak from the 12-min swim (0.40 and 5.7 ml.kg BW-1.min-1) and run (0.74 and 4.2 ml.kg BW-1.min-1) and for predictions of TR VO2peak from the 12-min swim (0.38 and 5.1 ml.kg BW-1.min-1) and run (0.88 and 2.6 ml.kg BW-1.min-1) indicated that the 12-min run was a more accurate predictor of TS or TR VO2peak than the 12-min swim. We conclude that the 12-min swim has relatively low validity as a field test of peak aerobic power and that it should not be considered an equally valid alternative to the 12-min run in young male recreational swimmers. However, the accuracy of predicting VO2peak from the 12-min swim is as good as some other commonly used methods, and, therefore, it may be adequate for fitness classification in situations in which a high level of accuracy is not needed.\r"
