  ".U": "87215509\r", 
  ".W": "References in the literature to the frequent occurrence of cervix carcinoma accompanied by nicotine abuse led us to investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on the results of treatment in primary irradiation of cervix carcinoma. As not only nicotine abuse but also diabetes mellitus can lead to angiopathy, we also investigated the influence of diabetes mellitus on the results of treatment. Of 410 nonsmokers with carcinoma of the cervix in Stages I and II, 260 (63.4%) reached the 5-year limit, but only 62 of 115 smokers survived (53.9%). In Stages III and IV there were significantly less favorable rates of cure in patients with nicotine abuse. Of 626 nonsmokers with cervix carcinoma in Stages III and IV, 212 survived (33.9%); but of 153 smokers, only 31 (20.1%) could be cured (P less than 0.01). The frequency of side effects of primary irradiation was distinctly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. Reversible complications occurred in 17.5% of the smokers and 15.5% of the nonsmokers. Severe irreversible changes occurred in 28% of the smokers versus 15.2% of the comparative group of nonsmokers (P less than 0.01). The injuries caused by smoking not only reduce the biologic effectiveness of ionizing radiation but also increase the rate of side effects due to the deficient capacity for regeneration of the tissue surrounding the tumor. With diabetes as a complication, however, no significant changes in frequency of side effects were noted. Five-year survival in diabetic patients was affected in Stage I and II, but not in the advanced stages.\r"

Primary sites of tumors included lung, ten; colon, two; gastric, one; ovarian, one; and unknown primary, one. Bilateral adrenal enlargement was defined as greater than 1 cm on CT scan. Adrenal insufficiency was defined as a failure to increase serum cortisol by at least 5 micrograms/100 ml to a minimum of 15 micrograms/100 ml at either 30 or 60 minutes postcosyntropin. No patient had previously been on corticosteroids. All patients were questioned and examined for symptoms/signs of adrenal insufficiency. Five patients (33%) were found to have adrenal insufficiency based on the cosyntropin test. Of the clinical parameters evaluated, all five patients had nausea, anorexia, and orthostatic hypotension. The clinical onset of adrenal insufficiency was insidious; no patient experienced acute adrenal crisis. We conclude that adrenal insufficiency is not a rare occurrence in patients with metastatic cancer and bilateral adrenal involvement on CT scan.\r"

Testicular tissue was abnormal in all patients, revealing peritubular fibrosis (six), decreased spermatogenesis (eight), interstitial edema (five), Sertoli cells only (one), and Leydig cell hyperplasia (two). Detailed hormone analysis in five patients revealed elevations of luteinizing hormone in four, decreased serum testosterone in two, elevations of estradiol in two, and elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin in one patient. A history of infertility was documented 2 months to 13 years before presentation in four patients and suspected in another. Extragonadal germ cell tumors, like their testicular counterparts are associated with primary germ cell defects, some of which seem to be independent of gonadotropin production by the tumor. In addition, the rather high incidence of antecedent infertility suggests that either a congenital or acquired primary germ cell defect contributes to defective spermatogenesis and the development of cancer in incompletely migrated germ cells.\r"

  ".U": "87215515\r", 
  ".W": "The thermometry results of radiofrequency (RF) capacitive hyperthermia for 60 deep-seated tumors in 59 patients are reported. Hyperthermia was administered regionally using two RF capacitive heating equipments which the authors have developed in cooperation with Yamamoto Vinyter Company Ltd., (Osaka, Japan). Intratumor temperatures were measured by thermocouples inserted through angiocatheters which were placed 5 cm to 12 cm deep into the tissues. Tumor center temperatures were measured for 307 treatments in all tumors; thermal distributions within tumors and surrounding normal tissues were obtained for 266 treatments of 53 tumors by microthermocouples. Thermometry results obtained were summarized as follows. A maximum tumor center temperature greater than 43 degrees C and 42 degrees C to 43 degrees C was obtained in 23 (38%) and 14 (23%) of the 60 tumors respectively. The time required to reach 43 degrees C in the tumor center was within 20 minutes after the start of hyperthermia in 87% of tumors heated to more than 43 degrees C. Temperature variations within a tumor exceeded 2 degrees C in 81% of tumors heated to more than 43 degrees C. The lowest tumor temperature greater than 42 degrees C was achieved in six of the 53 tumors (11%). Of 42 tumors in which temperatures of the subcutaneous fat, surrounding normal tissues, and the tumor center were compared, 24 (57%) showed the highest temperature in the tumor center and ten (24%) in the subcutaneous fat. When the heating efficacy was assessed in terms of a maximum tumor center, it great deal depended on the treatment site, tumor size, thickness of subcutaneous fat, and tumor type. Tumors in the head and neck, thorax, lower abdomen, and pelvis could be heated better than tumors in the upper abdomen. Greater heating efficacy was shown in patients with large, hypovascular tumors, and with the subcutaneous fat measuring less than 15 mm thick. The predominant limiting factor for power elevation was pain associated with heating. Systemic signs including increases in pulse rate and body temperature were not serious and seldom became limiting factors for power elevation. Our thermometry results indicate that the advantages of deep RF capacitive heating are its applicability to various anatomic sites and negligible systemic effects. The disadvantages are that its primary usefulness is limited to patients with thin subcutaneous fat and with large or hypovascular tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical effects and safety of radiofrequency (RF) capacitive hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy were evaluated in 40 patients with locally advanced deep-seated tumors. Hyperthermia was administered regionally with an 8-MHz or a 13.56-MHz RF heating device, once or twice a week after irradiation, four to 13 sessions total. Radiotherapy was delivered in fractions of 170 to 200 cGy a day, 5 days a week to 30 to 70 Gy to 33 patients, whereas the remaining seven patients received a total dose of 28 to 60 Gy in fractions of 400 cGy, twice a week. Six of the 40 tumors treated showed CR (100% regression), 6 PRa (80%-100% regression), 13 PRb (50%-80% regression), and 15 NR (less than 50% regression) when assessed by tumor size on computerized tomography (CT) scan. The tumor size before treatment was significantly smaller in CR + PRa tumors than in PRb + NR ones. TDF Time-dose fractionation (TDF) and number of heat treatments, however, did not differ significantly between the both tumors. Greater regression was observed in tumors heated to 41 to 43 degrees C in the maximum temperature than in tumors heated to below 41 degrees C or above 43 degrees C. The minimum tumor temperature was not related to the tumor regression. Posttreatment CT scan revealed remarkable low-density areas in 18 of the 34 tumors that did not regress completely. Histopathologic examinations demonstrated the low-density area to be massive coagulation necrosis and no malignant cell was observed in two tumors examined thoroughly. The types of low-density areas, which were classified according to its percent area in the tumor, correlated with the maximum and minimum tumor temperature. Most of the type III tumors (more than 80% low density) did not regrow in follow-up studies. Complications consisted of subcutaneous fat necrosis in four patients, local edema in four patients, and one abdominal abscess in one patient, all of which eventually resolved. These clinical results strongly suggest the usefulness of RF capacitive hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy for the treatment of refractory deep-seated tumors, and that intratumor low-density areas which appear on posttreatment CT seems to be a good parameter for assessing the tumor response to thermoradiotherapy.\r"

Examination of the relationship between the presence of intraperitoneal free cancer cells and serosal area invaded by the tumor revealed that only 22% of cases with an area of serosal invasion 10 cm2 or less were positive for free cancer cells, but such cells were found in 72% of cases with an area of serosal invasion greater than 20 cm2. The 5-year survival rate was 31% in patients with an area of serosal invasion of less than 10 cm2, whereas the rate was only 8% in patients with an area of serosal invasion greater than 20 cm2. Not only the presence of serosal invasion by a tumor but also the spatial extent of the invasion are significant factors that influence the prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Although the semisynthetic broad-spectrum acylureido-penicillin, azlocillin has been demonstrated to have significant antibiotic activity in leukemic patients, its role in combination therapy of febrile granulocytopenic patients with chemotherapy-treated solid tumors has not been clearly delineated. Thirty-five solid tumor patients with chemotherapy-induced absolute granulocytopenia (less than 1000 granulocytes/ml) associated with fever (greater than 38.3 degrees C) were treated on a prospective study with a combination of azlocillin 4 g intravenously (IV) every 6 hours, cephalothin 2 g IV every 6 hours, and tobramycin 80 to 100 mg IV every 8 to 12 hours. Prior chemotherapy included doxorubicin combinations in 18 patients and other combinations in 17 patients. Granulocyte counts preantibiotic therapy were greater than 100 granulocyte/ml in 14 patients, 100 to 499 in nine patients, and 500 to 1000 in 12 patients. Granulocyte nadirs were less than 100 in 20 patients, 100 to 499 in nine patients, and 500 to 1000 in six patients. Times for granulocytes to rise towards normal were 1 to 3 days in eight patients, 4 to 6 days in 18 patients, and 7 or more days in nine patients. Tobramycin levels were primarily in the peak range of 3 to 6 micrograms/ml and trough range of 0 to 1.9 micrograms/ml. The site and pathogen were identified in nine patients, the infection site clinically documented without isolated pathogen in three patients, and no site or pathogen identified in 23 patients. Of the 35 patients, 34 had good responses to the antibiotic combination (complete disappearance of fever and other evidence of infection). Serum creatinine rose 0.4 to 0.6 mg/dl in nine patients, 0.7 to 1.5 in four patients, and 1.5 in one patient (obstructive uropathy). The only other noted antibiotic-related side effect was hypokalemia. This antibiotic combination had little toxicity with marked efficacy.\r"

In previously treated patients, the complete remission rate was somewhat higher and the remission duration and survival were longer among those patients treated with the methotrexate containing program; however these differences were not statistically significant (P values = 0.88, 0.81, and 0.46, respectively).

Treatment consisted of a bilateral sequential infusion of peptichemio 20 mg, doxorubicin 10 mg and cisplatin 20 mg in a 6-hour period via an external infusion pump. After a rest period of 4 days, treatment restarted until maximum response or toxicity. Twenty-five patients, 12 with primary advanced (four Stage IIb, eight Stage III) and 13 with recurrent tumors were treated. All previously untreated patients obtained objective response. In particular, two patients with Stage IIb and III disease, respectively, achieved a complete response. Nine of 13 patients with recurrent disease (69%) were responsive, too, and therefore an overall objective response rate of 84% was achieved. Responses were noted after a median of five cycles of chemotherapy, whereas hematologic toxicity observed in all but one patient, was encountered after a median of four cycles. Toxicity of grade 1 and 2 was noted in 19 patients (76%), whereas of grade 3 and 4 in only 5 (20%). One treatment-related death, due to sepsis during myelosuppression, was reported. Catheter-related toxicity was noted in four patients causing femoral thrombosis in two. In one case a bypass operation was required. After intraarterial chemotherapy, all 21 responsive patients were eligible for radical surgery and 18 (86%) underwent both surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Surgery was excluded in three patients. In these three cases radiation therapy alone was employed. In this series, the schedule of intraarterial chemotherapy employed was very effective. Patient accrual is ongoing in order to confirm the response rate so far obtained and to evaluate, with a longer follow-up, the impact of this multidisciplinary approach on local control and survival.\r"

Twelve patients (43%) had had some pericardial event after radiation: a diagnosed pericarditis, remarkably increased heart volume, or a conspicuous change of cardiac silhouette, suggesting pericardial fluid. On evaluation, 50% of the patients complained of symptoms, and 13 patients had to stop the exercise test on a low level because of chest pain, dyspnea, or general fatigue. In 13 patients some of the following abnormalities in the electrocardiogram (ECG) was found: right bundle branch block (four), first-degree atrioventricular block (four), abnormal P terminal force (five), or a low voltage (two). In ten patients (38%) an increase of the pericardial fluid was seen in the echocardiogram, and in nine patients the right ventricle wall thickness had increased. In two patients a severe coronary artery disease was found. One died suddenly after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the other had a large anterior AMI. Two patients with chronic pericardial fluid underwent partial pericardectomy. Two cases of mild pulmonary valve stenosis, one pulmonary subvalvular stenosis and two aortic valve deformities were discovered. Eight patients went through cardiac catheterization, and in all but one case the pressures were slightly elevated suggesting diminished diastolic compliance. In summary, 19 of 28 patients had some abnormal cardiac findings, but only three of them were serious ones.\r"

During the relatively short period of investigation of this family, an intensive educational and surveillance program has been mounted in the interest of improving cancer control through direct application of knowledge of natural history and the risk factor evidence through pedigree assessment.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA content of selected areas of 16 glioblastoma multiforme predominantly composed of small anaplastic cells was investigated. These findings were contrasted with those of five cases of anaplastic astrocytomas. The microfluorometric determination of DNA was performed on mechanically isolated single cells stained by the Feulgen method, obtained from selected areas of the neoplasms in paraffin blocks. Twelve of 16 cases of glioblastoma multiforme had a main population that was diploid-near diploid. Although four of the five anaplastic astrocytomas disclosed a diploid-near diploid main population there was a more complex DNA distribution than in the small cells in glioblastomas. These differences were evident using two numerical DNA indices obtained from the analysis of each tumor histogram which defined, respectively, the extent to which the main tumor cell population deviated from euploid values and the probabilities to have multiple stemlines with abnormal DNA content. The results suggest that small anaplastic cells which appear to represent the most aggressive population in glioblastomas have a DNA content diploid-near diploid, and in malignant gliomas the degree of aneuploidy of the main stemline is not related to the biologic behavior of the neoplasm.\r"

All the benign (n = 24) and semimalignant (n = 6) tumors were diploid. Of 50 malignant tumors, 24 (48%) were diploid and 26 (52%) were aneuploid. Aneuploidy was more frequent in the advanced stages of the disease, in tumors of low degree of differentiation, and in older patients. The patients with aneuploid tumors had smaller primary tumors and more often ascites. The fraction of cells with S-phase DNA content was higher in the aneuploid tumors. No association was seen to the tumor type. Ploidy determination is objective and reproducible. Aneuploidy associates to most negative prognostic factors in ovarian carcinoma and may reflect the aggressiveness of the tumor. The ploidy status may be taken into consideration in the stratification of patients of comparable risk for treatment studies.\r"

  ".W": "Nine years after biopsy and radiation therapy for an extramedullary plasmacytoma of the nasal cavity, a 64-year-old man developed locally recurrent tumor. Repeat biopsy revealed tumor identical in hematoxylin and eosin stain (H & E) appearance to that found originally, leading to the diagnosis of recurrent extramedullary plasmacytoma. Neither the original tumor or its recurrence demonstrated features characteristic of esthesioneuroblastoma (e.g., nests, rosettes, ganglion cells, or fibrillary background). However, Gremilus staining and neuron specific enolase tests (immunoperoxidase method), done strictly as a teaching exercise, were strongly positive and eventually resulted in an altered diagnosis to esthesioneuroblastoma. This case underscores the difficulty that may be encountered in distinguishing these two pathologic entities of the nasal cavity solely on the basis of H & E staining. In view of differences in staging, evaluation, prognosis, and management, accurate differentiation of these two relatively uncommon tumors of the nasal cavity is of immediate clinical importance. These observations suggest that care should be taken to exclude the possibility of esthesioneuroblastoma before making the histologic diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma of the nasal cavity.\r"

Between 1951 and 1984, there were seven adult patients who fulfilled the criteria: focal or multifocal neurologic disease of abrupt onset; systemic cancer; and pathologic demonstration of tumor emboli in appropriate vessels. Tumors originated from the lung in four patients and from the colon and hypopharynx in one each; in one patient the primary source was unknown. Five patients had carotid and two had vertebrobasilar system strokes. Two patients had at least one antecedent transient ischemic attack (TIA). Three patients presented with cerebral infarction as the initial manifestation of their cancer. In two patients, it occurred immediately after pneumonectomy. In four patients, cerebral infarction occurred in a setting of widespread systemic, including pulmonary, metastases. At postmortem examination, one patient had a single large basilar artery tumor embolus. The others had multiple large and small vessel tumor embolic occlusions. The anterior circulation was affected in three patients, the posterior circulation in two, and both circulations were affected in two. Four patients had additional brain parenchymal metastases including one with diffuse leptomeningeal spread.\r"

Examination of the resected specimen showed infiltration of the duct walls by sheets of metastatic carcinomatous cells from the previous breast cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful in both patients with disappearance of all symptoms due to the biliary obstruction. The first patient died 4 years later from peritoneal deposits and the second was alive at 30 months with a metastasis to the hip. These observations differ from most of those previously reported, by the localization of the tumor at the hilus and the direct infiltration of the duct walls by the tumor. The results of this study suggest that aggressive surgical treatment may be the treatment of choice in patients with extrahepatic biliary metastases of breast carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "There are few published reports regarding the long-term results of the operative treatment of significant mitral regurgitation secondary to coronary artery occlusive disease. The few available reports deal with mitral replacement and myocardial revascularization. We prefer repair of the mitral apparatus to replacement, whether combined with myocardial revascularization or done alone. On the basis of our experience with 141 patients requiring myocardial revascularization with mitral valve repair or replacement over the past 12 years, we have come to the following conclusions: Good long-term survival and short-term results can be expected when patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation and coronary artery disease require surgical treatment. The in-hospital mortality in these patients approaches 15 percent. Patients who are so symptomatic that they require operation within 60 days of a myocardial infarction can be helped but will have poorer results than patients with more remote events. Patients with poor ejection fractions do worse than patients with good ejection fractions. Mitral valve repair is superior to mitral valve replacement. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure, and the grade of mitral regurgitation do not seem to be significant determinants of outcome and should not be the basis for denying operation to symptomatic patients. Patients with minimal mitral regurgitation (grade 1/6) and good ventricular function should not undergo corrective valve operation because of the unduly high risk that valve replacement will be required.\r"

Four patients had bilateral obstructions, and one patient had unilateral iliopudendal arterial disease. Balloon angioplasty was used to dilate bilateral lesions in three patients and unilateral lesions in two patients. Four of the five patients had improvement in erectile function for 2 to 18 months (mean, 12 months) after angioplasty. We conclude that balloon angioplasty is an adequate, expeditious, and relatively inexpensive method for treating subtotal obstruction of the internal iliac and/or internal pudendal arteries in patients with vasculogenic impotence.\r"

This report describes an alternative technique to immediate removal of the balloon dilatation system for cardiac arrest complicating coronary angioplasty.

Fifty patients were successfully studied by means of this technique without incident. In 20 cases, the ipsilateral internal mammary artery was subsequently visualized.

Recently, a new catheter for monitoring central hemodynamic pressures, which has a right ventricular port (Chandler pacing port), has been devised, which has been reported to allow for simultaneous acquisition of hemodynamic data and reliable pacemaker function as well. To assess the reliability of this catheter, we studied ten consecutive Swan-Ganz catheterizations utilizing this new catheter system. In all instances, hemodynamic monitoring was established without difficulty. In three instances, because of right heart enlargement, fluoroscopy was necessary to position the pacing probe at the right ventricular apex. In all ten instances, a threshold of less than 2.5 mV was obtained. Isolated PVCs and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were common during insertion. After initial placement, the threshold for sensing and pacing was assessed every 6 hr. Malfunction occurred in three patients. In all, repositioning was accomplished without marked difficulty; in one it required fluoroscopy. In three instances, the Swan-Ganz pacing catheter system malfunctioned. These data are similar to data utilizing other modalities of temporary pacing and suggest that this catheter may be capable of providing hemodynamic monitoring and pacing from a single percutaneous procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrence (restenosis) after coronary angioplasty has undermined the initial success of the procedure and has compromised, to some extent, the attractiveness of the technique in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Assessment of recurrence predictors has been problematic due to lack of coordination of angioplasty recurrence research and includes: incomplete angiographic documentation, variations in definitions of restenosis anatomically and the results of restenosis physiologically (ie, myocardial ischemia), the dirth of morphologic specifications of subsets under investigation and late outcome pathology, limitations in statistical analyses used, and minimal efforts to classify the available data on recurrence. A review of the literature suggests that all findings regarding recurrence after angioplasty can be organized in four categories: clinical, morphologic, technical (or procedural), and pharmacologic. The reported findings with high concordance as risk factors for recurrence after angioplasty include the clinical factors of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and angina of short duration or unstable presentation. Morphologic factors which have been corroborated vis-a-vis recurrence include stenoses with diameter reduction of greater than 90% before and greater than 30% after angioplasty, residual trans-stenotic pressure gradients of greater than 20 mmHg after angioplasty, and lesions that are diffuse, long, eccentric, or calcified. Technical factors associated with recurrence include lower balloon/vessel (or graft) ratios and the absence of (uncomplicated) \"intimal dissection.\" The category most deficient in research regarding recurrence after angioplasty is pharmacologic. Since there are statistically documented and reproducible factors predictive of restenosis, to ignore or minimize these findings or resist further evaluation (because of the ease and safety of performing repeat angioplasty) is to deny the opportunity to understand the mechanisms and favorably affect the incidence of recurrence. This review concludes with two major implications of the restenosis research: certain clinical, technical, and pharmacologic factors, if addressed, may predictably decrease the rate of restenosis and certain clinical and morphologic factors may increase the risk of restenosis; these factors may be less readily modified (eg, diabetes, lesion calcification) and thus must be considered in the decision for angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Eight patients had native left anterior descending (LAD) lesions and three had LAD saphenous vein grafts lesions. Lesions were considered to be \"very proximal\" when one half or more of the balloon was inflated in the left main coronary artery for the native LAD lesions or the aorta for the LAD coronary artery saphenous vein bypass graft (CABG) lesions. There was a mean reduction in stenosis from 88.3% (range 75-99) to 13.8% (range 0-60) and a mean reduction in transtenotic gradient from 47.2 mmHg (range 20-80) to 8.3 mmHg (range 0-20). The initial success rate was 90.9% (10 out of 11 patients) with a partial success in the other patient. No complications occurred in any of the patients. Two patients had restenosis (18.2%) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively, post-PTCA. It is concluded that \"very proximal\" lesions can be successfully dilated with a high initial success rate and low complication rate. Nevertheless, these lesions may present problems with guiding catheter stability and, because of the potential risk of circumflex (CX) occlusion, this vessel may have to be protected with a second guidewire.\r"

  ".W": "The thermal dilution technique (TD) of measuring cardiac output (Q) has been assumed to be inaccurate when the tricuspid valve is regurgitant (TR). The indicator transit time from the right atrium to pulmonary artery (PA) is prolonged and may increase indicator loss to the heart and adjacent tissue. We surgically created TR in four anaesthetized dogs and compared simultaneous cardiac output measurement made with an implanted PA flow probe with intermittent TD cardiac output measurements. We found an excellent correlation (r = 0.98) between the techniques in the normal heart when Q was increased by 100-150 per cent of control values using an intravenous dobutamine infusion. After TR was produced by incorporating the tricuspid valve leaflet within a suture, Q decreased. Dextran 40 was then infused and Q increased significantly. The rate at which Q increased was greater with the TD technique than with the PA flow probe; however, a significant (r = 0.85) linear relationship was still present with TR. The altered thermal waveform detected by the PA thermistor in TR was characterized by a lower peak amplitude and a slower return to baseline. Within the limitations of an animal model, our data suggest that TD cardiac output may be more accurate than previously assumed, particularly in low output states.\r"

Gram negative pneumonia resulted in significant increases in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients [(A-a)DO2] and pulmonary shunt fractions (Qs/Qt), as well as a significant decrease in QLLL during SB. Significant differences in standard haemodynamics, (A-a)DO2, Qs/Qt, and QLLL were not observed when HFV was compared to CMV. However, serum levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were elevated when the animals underwent HFV. We conclude that HFV is a safe and efficient method of oxygenation and ventilation in unilobar gram negative pneumonia and also results in a significant increase in the serum levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha when compared to CMV in sheep. The exact significance of the latter finding is the subject of current investigation.\r"

Train-of-four stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. Doses producing 90 per cent first twitch blockade were 2.5 and 15 mg for succinylcholine and atracurium respectively. The onset of action was 6 min for both relaxants, and time to 90 per cent first twitch recovery was 20 min for succinylcholine and 16 min for the atracurium-edrophonium combination. It is concluded that the use of atracurium in these patients does not offer marked advantages over small doses of succinylcholine.\r"

The clinical features of this congenital syndrome and the acute management of its complications are described. As elective surgery is frequently required for ocular, musculo-skeletal or cardiovascular problems in people with Marfan's syndrome, patients must be carefully assessed preoperatively for specific complications. Significant pulmonary problems include restriction of lung function due to pectus excavatum or kyphoscoliosis and intrinsic pulmonary involvement with emphysema, bronchogenic cysts and \"honeycomb lung.\" This leads to a significant incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax and the danger of tension pneumothorax with positive pressure ventilation. The commonest causes of sudden death are cardiovascular complications, in particular rupture and dissection of the ascending aorta. Preoperative assessment should include echocardiography to determine the size of the aortic root. The anaesthetic technique chosen should both decrease myocardial contractility and avoid sudden increases in contractility, in order to minimise the risk of aortic dissection or rupture.\r"

However, the effects of changing sinus pressure around a normal arterial pressure set-point of 100 mm Hg have not been examined. In anesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs, we distended the vascularly isolated carotid sinuses with a pulsatile pressure and recorded isometric tension in an upper tracheal segment. The aortic nerves were cut. Increasing mean carotid sinus pressure in steps between 100 and 200 mm Hg decreased tracheal tension, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure; decreasing sinus pressure between 100 and 25 mm Hg had the opposite effect. Changing carotid sinus pressure still evoked tracheal responses when systemic arterial pressure was held constant. Increasing and decreasing carotid sinus pulse pressure around a constant mean pressure evoked similar changes in tracheal tension. All reflex effects were abolished by cutting or cooling (0 degree C) the carotid sinus nerves; tracheal responses were abolished by the carotid baroreflex were of comparable magnitude to those triggered by stimulating pulmonary stretch receptors, laryngeal receptors, and pulmonary C-fibers. Our results indicate that carotid sinus baroreceptors exert a tonic influence on the upper airways by a vagal cholinergic pathway, increasing and decreasing tracheal smooth muscle tension as blood pressure varies around the normal set-point.\r"

  ".W": "This study presents a quantitative comparison of the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and the free concentration in the lumen of the dense tubules of the human platelet. The former was measured by the fluorescence of the high affinity indicator quin2 and latter by the fluorescence of chlorotetracycline (CTC). The CTC technique monitors calcium-CTC complex accumulation in the lumen of dense tubules and mitochondria when washed platelets were incubated in 2 mM Ca2+. Resting cytoplasmic and dense tubular Ca2+ concentrations were studied in platelets from patients suffering from venous and arterial thrombosis. Compared with normal controls (0.40 +/- 0.10, n = 54), the values of the calcium-CTC ratios were 0.68 +/- 0.19 (n = 16, p less than 0.005) in venous thrombosis; 0.75 +/- 0.18 (n = 14, p less than 0.005) in cardiovascular accident; 0.84 +/- 0.18 (n = 6, p less than 0.005) in occlusive peripheral vascular diseases; and 0.42 +/- 0.10 (n = 21, p greater than 0.1) in patient controls. The dense tubular Ca2+ levels for both patients and controls were perfectly correlated with the cytoplasmic levels using an equation that assumes that the dense tubular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]dt) has a second power dependence on [Ca2+]cyt. The abnormal Ca2+ handling of platelets obtained from thrombotic patients could be completely reversed by preincubation with the calcium channel blocker verapamil. These observations suggest that the primary Ca2+ handling defect is the leakage through activated channels in the plasma membrane. The defect and the elevated resting [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]dt are adequate to explain the observation of increased rates of collagen-activated aggregation in the above-mentioned group of patients. The results can be explained by platelets from thrombosis patients being exposed to activating factors in the circulation, resulting in Ca2+ channel activation. Channel activation persists through the process of platelet isolation and washing and is manifested in higher measured values of [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]dt in the \"resting state.\" This would bring the platelet closer to its aggregation when aggregation-inducing agents are added. The CTC test is shown to be a useful and convenient means of detecting this abnormality.\r"

Aortas from SHR were less sensitive to the contractile effect of Ca2+ than their WKY controls (EC50 was 3.18 +/- 0.03 in WKY and 2.76 +/- 0.13 in SHR, p less than 0.05). The relaxant effect of NIF was dissociated from its effect on Ca2+ influx in SHR aortas. NIF 10(-10) M relaxed the muscle by 100% without producing Ca2+ influx blockage, and NIF 10(-9) and 10(-8) M induced Ca2+ influx blockage while the muscle continued in the relaxed state. Chemically skinned aortic fibers from SHR were less sensitive to the contractile effect of Ca2+ than their normotensive (NR) controls (pCa for EC50 was 5.91 +/- 0.05 in SHR and 6.20 +/- 0.03 in NR, p less than 0.05). NIF 10(-10) M depressed the contractile response to Ca2+ significantly more in SHR than in NR skinned fibers (pCa for EC50 for 5.62 +/- 0.09 in SHR and 6.07 +/- 0.07 in NR, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using the isolated perfused rat heart with transient (10-minute) regional ischemia induced by coronary artery ligation, we have shown that PBN (N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone), an organic spin trap agent designed specifically to form \"stable\" adducts with free radicals in electron spin resonance studies, can dramatically reduce the vulnerability of the myocardium to reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation. Studied in the concentration range of 5-1,000 microM/L, PBN added to the perfusate 5 minutes prior to ischemia exerted a dose-dependent protective effect. At the optimum concentration of 30 microM/L PBN reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation to 50% (6 of 12) from its control value of 100% (12 of 12). The antiarrhythmic effect was achieved without any substantial effect on coronary flow or heart rate. Investigating whether this was a direct antiarrhythmic effect, operating during reperfusion, or an indirect effect arising from the action of PBN on the heart during ischemia, PBN (30 microM/L) was added to the perfusion fluid 2 minutes before reperfusion. In the control group, 100% of the hearts fibrillated whereas only 50% fibrillated in the PBN group. Additional studies were designed to ascertain whether the drug caused an absolute reduction in vulnerability to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias (irrespective of the duration of ischemia) or whether it only shifted the ischemic time-reperfusion vulnerability curve to the right (i.e., delayed the onset of vulnerability). Thus, studies were undertaken to define the relation between the duration of ischemia and the incidence of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in control hearts and hearts treated with PBN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The total ATPase activity of myosin and the values for the isozyme V1 have been measured in hearts from rats of different ages and with different levels of thyroid function. The contribution of V3 was calculated from the difference between total and V1 ATPase, neglecting the small contribution of V2. Hearts were quickly frozen after rapid removal from the animals in order to preserve the state of ATPase activity that existed in the intact animal, and ATPase activity was measured in thin sections of tissue by a microphotometric technique. In euthyroid hearts, although cAMP increases total myosin ATPase activity and the activity of V1, the cyclic nucleotide inhibits the ATPase activity of V3. In hearts from rats with developing hypothyroidism following thyroidectomy, the same occurs. After a sufficient period has elapsed after thyroidectomy for V1 to have practically disappeared, cAMP has no effect on ATPase activity, but the injection of thyroid hormone restores the effect. Total myosin ATPase activity is maintained relatively constant as the animal ages from 80 to 165 days and during the first 10-11 days following thyroidectomy even though the concentration of V1 is dropping. The explanation proposed for these observations is that myosin can exist in two different forms, only one of which can participate in the active generation of force. The transition between the two forms is regulated by a soluble factor that is itself controlled by the adrenergic system. The factor(s) involved in this regulatory mechanism is soluble and can be transferred between different thin sections cut from a frozen heart.\r"

  ".W": "The factors responsible for collateral arterial growth after major artery occlusion remain obscure, despite their importance for tissue survival. An increase in endothelial cell labelling with tritiated thymidine, as an index of collateral arterial growth, occurs early after renal artery occlusion. Our working premise was that an increase in endothelial cell labelling would occur simultaneously throughout the length of the collateral arteries if biophysical factors related to blood flow were the responsible mechanism, because blood flow must be increased simultaneously throughout the length of the small, preformed collateral arterial vessels. On the other hand, if the information spread from the ischemic zone, one would anticipate centripetal spread of the endothelial cell hyperplasia in a retrograde direction from the ischemic zone. With the periureteric collateral arterial supply as the model, we performed serial studies of tritiated thymidine labelling following renal artery stenosis in the rat. As anticipated, endothelial cell labelling rose sharply within 24 to 48 hours, first evident in the area immediately adjacent to the renal hilum. Thereafter, a progressive, time-related centripetal gradient in endothelial cell tritiated thymidine labelling occurred (p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that the factors responsible for endothelial cell hyperplasia are less related to blood flow in the lumen than to downstream, ischemic events. Although the mechanism responsible for the centripetal spread remains speculative, the communication system is likely to involve cell-to-cell contact in the vessel wall.\r"

  ".W": "The vasoconstrictor effects of 9,11-epithio-11,12-methano-thromboxane A2 (STA2) on smooth muscle strips of the rabbit coronary artery have been investigated in vitro. Right coronary artery (RCA) was more responsive to STA2 than either the left anterior descending or the circumflex coronary artery. On endothelium-denuded RCA strips, the sensitivity and responsiveness to STA2 were greater than observed on intact muscle strips. A thromboxane(Tx)-antagonist, (9,11), (11,12)-dideoxa-9 alpha, 11 alpha-dimethylmethano-11,12-methano-13,14-dihydro-13-aza-14-oxo-15 - cyclopenthyl-16,17,18,19,20-pethanol-15-epi-TxA2 (ONO-3708), inhibited the STA2-induced contraction, whereas atropine or prazosin had no effect. Nifedipine partly inhibited the STA2-induced contraction, one half of which was still evoked in Ca2+-free solution. When acetylcholine was applied prior to the application of STA2 in Ca2+-free solution, the STA2-vasoconstriction disappeared. In saponin-treated chemically skinned muscle strips, STA2 itself had no effect on either the pCa-tension relation or on the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. However, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released Ca2+ from such stores, and 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and 1,2-diolein, activators of protein kinase C, enhanced the contraction induced by 0.3 microM Ca2+. It is concluded that STA2 acts on the TxA2 receptor and produces contraction due to an increase in both voltage- and agonist(receptor)-dependent Ca2+ influx. STA2 also releases Ca2+ from ACh- and caffeine-sensitive storage sites.\r"

  ".W": "Contractile agonists can mobilize Ca2+ from both intracellular and extracellular stores in smooth muscle. This study addresses the role of Ca2+ mobilization as it relates to the complex manner by which Ca2+ regulates the contractile system in smooth muscle. In swine carotid media, both histamine and phenylephrine produced initial rapid increases in myosin phosphorylation and stress. Stress was sustained for the duration of the stimulus while myosin phosphorylation slowly declined to steady-state levels. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or elimination of cellular Ca2+ influx did not dramatically reduce the initial rapid increase in myosin phosphorylation produced by either agonist but reduced steady-state levels of myosin phosphorylation to basal values. Initial rapid increases in stress were seen, but stress was not maintained. Following depletion of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscle activation by Ca2+ influx in the presence of phenylephrine occurred without an initial transient in myosin phosphorylation, and stress developed slowly. Steady-state levels of myosin phosphorylation and stress were not different from control values. Similar results were obtained with histamine, although a small transient in myosin phosphorylation was also seen. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in vascular smooth muscle is to provide high myoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations causing extensive myosin phosphorylation and rapid crossbridge cycling leading to rapid stress development. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, control levels of agonist-induced steady-state stress and myosin phosphorylation could be produced without an initial phosphorylation transient when intracellular Ca2+ pools were depleted, suggesting that the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not required for the regulation of steady-state myoplasmic [Ca2+] during \"latch\".\r"

In air, laser beams produced from ArF (193 nm) and XeF (351 nm) excimer laser gas mixtures were delivered to samples of myocardium and atherosclerotic coronary arterial segments through the wall of a quartz cell, using 8-40 mJ/pulse. In blood, 351 nm were delivered via an optical fiber, using 14 mJ/pulse. When the experiments were performed using an air-tissue interface, the dominant photoproducts identified in order of elution from the gas chromatographic column were methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, propyne, allene, propylene, propane, and butene. When a fiberoptic was used to accomplish 351-nm excimer laser tissue ablation in a blood field, a similar gas chromatographic spectral distribution was observed. These vapor-phase photoproducts are indistinguishable from those observed following continuous wave laser irradiation or flame torching of cardiovascular tissues. Thus, despite the fact that excimer laser ablation of cardiovascular tissues is characterized by the absence of signs of thermal injury, the results of these experiments suggest that the predominant mechanism of excimer ablation is, like continuous-wave laser irradiation, a thermal process.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of crossbridge phosphorylation and cellular activation rates in arterial smooth muscle are unknown, and the response rates are usually limited by agonist diffusion rates. In this study, electrical field stimulation (10-20 V AC, 60 Hz) was used to activate strips of swine carotid artery smooth muscle. Pretreatment with 0.5 microM phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) for 30 minutes significantly inhibited field stimulated stress due to norepinephrine released from adrenergic nerves. Addition of 1-10 mM tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) to PBZ-pretreated tissues allowed direct stimulation of muscle cells and significantly potentiated the response to field stimulation. Activation in field stimulated tissues pretreated with PBZ and TEA was strongly inhibited by the Ca2+-channel antagonist verapamil (0.5 microM for 15 minutes). Activation was rapid with myosin light chain (MLC)-phosphorylation values rising to greater than 50% of total MLC, with a half-time of approximately 1 second. Stress and stiffness development was biphasic and lagged with an estimated half-time for the first phase of 3 seconds. Stress and stiffness continued to slowly rise after 5 seconds of stimulation, while MLC phosphorylation declined significantly between 5 and 10 seconds to a nearly constant value of 35-40% for up to 60 seconds. Unloaded shortening velocity was maximal (0.067 Lo/sec) at the earliest time point examined (0.5 second), prior to significant stress development and at submaximal phosphorylation. Significant decreases in unloaded shortening velocity were observed after 10 seconds. These results show that the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and the rates of activation are very rapid in this arterial smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The instantaneous force-velocity relations of cat papillary muscles were studied at different times in the twitch in normal and in postextrasystolic potentiated contractions. Fourteen to sixteen different loads were used to define each of the force-velocity curves. The curves were fitted by a least-squares procedure to the hyperbolic (Hill equation). The hyperbolae were extrapolated to obtain maximum velocity and isometric force and interpolated to obtain maximum power. All three of these values rose more quickly than developed force. Maximum velocity reached 77% of its peak at the earliest time studied, 20-25% of the time to peak force. Developed force achieved 22% of its final value at this time, while extrapolated isometric force and maximum power both reached 44% of their peak values. Postextrasystolic potentiation sufficient to produce a 1.5 to twofold increase in peak developed force produced less than a 20% increase in extrapolated maximum velocity. The results can be interpreted in terms of a model in which the maximum velocity of the contractile elements remains constant during the twitch. Variation in maximum velocity is attributed to a small internal load, equivalent to 6% of twitch force. Since maximum velocity is relatively constant, it does not give a good measure of changes in the force-velocity curves. By contrast, the extrapolated isometric force and maximum power are much more sensitive to changes in the force-velocity curves, and they vary in proportion to each other. The advantage of using interpolated maximum power rather than isometric force to define changes in the curves is that it can be normalized to muscle mass.\r"

We propose that this is due to posterior rhinomanometry measuring the resistance of the nasopharynx as well as the resistance of the nose. In the past a discrepancy between the 2 methods has been claimed to be due to an error in the standard form of the parallel resistance equation. This hypothesis was tested by measuring total nasal resistance by posterior rhinomanometry and comparing this with a total nasal resistance value derived from posterior rhinomanometric measurements of the resistance of the individual nasal cavities. The standard form of the parallel resistance formula was used to derive the total nasal resistance. There was no significant difference between the 2 values for total nasal resistance. We conclude that if measurements are made at the same pressure gradient then the use of this equation is valid.\r"

Thus in most cases suspicion is raised by the clinical history and the presence of a fistula confirmed at operation. In children such fistulae may be relatively silent and the diagnosis difficult to establish. This paper reports the results of using an impedance bridge and ENG-controlled fistula test in the routine screening of 24 children with unilateral sensorineural deafness, and compares the results obtained to those found from testing 21 normal and asymptomatic children of comparable age and sex. These tests have shown that fistula testing may mimic a previously recorded gaze or positional nystagmus and hence give false positive results. In the routine testing of patients with deafness only 1 subject had nystagmus invoked by fistula testing alone, and in this case it was obvious from all other criteria that no fistula was present. The conclusions drawn are that the method is prone to error if spontaneous, gaze and positional nystagmus are not recorded and that in routine clinical use the test may produce erroneous results. New criteria for the interpretation of the test in children are suggested, but it seems that the best means of diagnosis still remains an accurate history and a readiness to explore the ear to confirm the diagnosis.\r"

The mean malignancy score was 18.0 for tumours with metastases and 13.0 for those without (P less than 0.05, chi square test). Nuclear polymorphism, mode of invasion, vascular invasion, and cellular response were the single factors with the strongest influence. All but 3 carcinomas were DNA diploid, but DNA ploidy and proliferative activity (S-phase) yielded no prognostic information. However, hypertetraploid cells were found in all DNA diploid carcinomas with metastases, but in only half of those without (P less than 0.05).\r"

This form of imaging proved to be highly accurate in depicting the extent of soft tissue within the middle ear cleft and mastoid. With the exception of the long process of the incus and the stapes superstructure, the state of the ossicular chain was correctly predicted in over 90% of cases. Erosion of the labyrinth was clearly depicted in 4 of the 5 cases in which it occurred. A correct pathological diagnosis was made radiologically in 44 cases (88%). The selective use of this modality in the evaluation of patients with chronic suppurative otitis media is valuable.\r"

They were seen as soon as possible after an episode of infection and the presence or absence of middle ear effusion was determined by a combination of tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy. The sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (90%) of this method were determined by comparing the prediction of effusions using this method with the results of myringotomy in a group of children with chronic secretory otitis media. The parents of the children with recurrent otitis media were questioned about previous aural discharge, chronic nasal symptoms, family history of atopy, numbers of siblings and breast feeding in infancy. Forty-one per cent of the 58 children studied had effusion(s) 2 months after their presenting episodes, while by 3 months this figure had fallen to 33%. Significantly more of the children with persistent effusions at 2 months had received cephalexin than of those who were effusion free at that stage (P less than 0.05). There were no other statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. Nine children had had aural discharge during the presenting episode and 5 of these developed persistent effusions.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty patients with end stage chronic renal failure (CRF) enrolled in a dialysis program underwent studies of serum thyroid hormones and carbohydrate metabolic state. The aim of the study was: 1) to evaluate whether the glucose intolerance per se represents a factor for the alteration of circulating thyroid hormones; and 2) to explore the potential usefulness of specific thyroid hormones and particularly reverse T3 (RT3) as indicators for predicting glucose intolerance. Forty-two patients received hemodialysis and 18 were on intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). CRF patients had reduced serum total T4 and T3 levels, slightly decreased RT3 and TBG concentrations and normal TSH values. There was no significant difference in serum thyroid hormone indices between HD and IPD patients. Glucose intolerance was found in 25 patients. Ten had fasting hyperglycemia and diabetic response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 15 had an impaired glucose tolerance according to the criteria of the National Diabetes Data Group. In CRF patients with glucose intolerance, serum T3 and T3/T4 molar ratio were significantly lower than in those with a normal OGTT response, whereas serum RT3 and RT3/T4 molar ratio were found to be higher. In the whole group of CRF patients these serum thyroid hormones closely correlated with glucose tolerance indices. To investigate the usefulness of serum RT3 assay in predicting glucose intolerance we compared the outcome of the OGTT and serum RT3 values. Using the results of the OGTT as the true diagnosis of glucose intolerance, serum RT3 assay showed a diagnostic specificity of 94.2% and a sensitivity of 100%. In conclusion these results suggest that: 1) the glucose intolerance, which frequently occurs in uremia, may influence circulating thyroid hormones probably leading to a shift in the peripheral tissue conversion of T4 from T3 to RT3; and 2) serum RT3 assay could assume a clinical interest in assessing carbohydrate metabolic state in treated end stage renal failure independently of the type of dialysis therapy.\r"

In all cases there was irregular thickening of peripheral glomerular capillary loops and paramesangial deposits. Arteriolar hyalinosis was present in two of the three cases. By direct immunofluorescence, and immunoperoxidase techniques in one case, IgM was present in the glomeruli and C3 was present in blood vessel walls. Secretory component was not detected in the glomeruli of any of the patients. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation immune complex assay was positive for IgM and IgG immune complexes in one patient and weakly positive for IgM immune complexes alone in another. The serum of one patient contained milk precipitins. All three patients had suffered from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. It is suggested that the glomerular IgM immune complex deposition is related to the IgA deficiency and that, although the immune complexes may be a consequence of antibodies to dietary bovine proteins, this could be due to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. This type of glomerulonephritis appears to resemble IgM associated glomerulonephritis in some aspects. Careful appraisal is required to establish if this association constitute a specific entity.\r"

The frequency of occurrence of transmigration is relatively low, and, in many cases, other routes of ovum and sperm transport (i.e., intrauterine migration, tubal recanalization, fistula formation) may lead to the ectopic implantation site. In our view, the percentage of abnormal embryos associated with EP is no different from those associated with spontaneous abortions of intrauterine origin. Embryos from spontaneous abortions-of either intrauterine or extrauterine origin-seem to have more abnormalities than embryos from induced abortions. Other etiologic factors such as tubal disease, strictures of the fallopian tube, or endocrinopathies seem to contribute more significantly to the incidence of EP than does abnormal embryogenesis.\r"

If the membranes are intact, amniotomy should be performed. If cervical dilatation at a rate of at least 1 cm/h does not occur promptly, oxytocin should be begun. Efficient and safe use of oxytocin requires knowledge of its clinical pharmacologic characteristics: that the maximum level of a dose is not reached for approximately 40 minutes, that the blood level needed is a reflection of the sensitivity of the myometrium, and the blood level produced by a specific dose is a manifestation of the plasma clearance rate. While it has never been demonstrated that continuous electronic monitoring of the uterus and fetus with intermittent visits from professional personnel is better than palpation and auscultation performed by an educated attendant present continuously, the former practice is more common in the United States than the latter. If maximum use is to be made of the information provided by the uterine monitor, the data must be quantitated. When the patient's inadequate contractility fails to improve in response to the initial dose of 1 mU/m, the dose must be increased until some improvement is noted. Geometric incrementation should be limited to nulliparas in whom each dose of oxytocin is evaluated after a 40-minute infusion period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The problem with single-exposure technique is that a good exposure of the hip overexposes the lower leg. This problem is solved by using leaded acrylic wedges, which, when placed in front of the X-ray tube (collimator), block excessive radiation to the lower limb and create an evenly exposed film of the entire lower extremity. The development of these collimator wedge filters and the advent of newer fast-speed film and screens have reduced the amount of radiation absorbed by the patient by eight times or more. Guided by a chart to interchange and choose between film/screen combinations, the method and technique provides the surgeon with an exact alignment of the limb and joints for all kinds of operations.\r"

Seven patients (14%) were considered chymopapain treatment failures and were later treated with surgical discectomy. Only two of these seven patients (30%) had obvious changes in their three-month CT scan. Chymopapain injection did not alter the size of the herniated portion of the disc during the first three months after chymopapain injection. A decision to operate for presumed chymopapain failure should therefore be based on clinical grounds, rather than on the three-month CT appearance of the herniated disc.\r"

The overall results, using the Merle d'Aubigne grading system, were excellent in four, very good in nine, good in nine, fair in one, and failure in seven. No acetabular protrusio was observed. The seven failures were associated with deep infection in one case and unsatisfactory technique in three. One failure was unexplained, except that the ON was Grade IV. Two failures occurred in one patient with predisposing factors, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and exogenous hypercortisonism. Although the results are not as satisfactory as those of total hip arthroplasty (THA) with respect to relief of persistent pain, some patients remain stable with time even after more than ten years. With correct indications and good surgical technique, SCC arthroplasty is a justifiable alternative to THA in young adults.\r"

Children younger than two years of age or weighing less than 30 pounds are normally treated with skin traction or immobilized in a plaster cast or both. Older or heavier children are often treated with skeletal traction, followed by early or late application of spica cast in the neutral position. A method of spica cast treatment that immobilizes the limb in the 90-90 position using a reinforced cast incorporating a distal femoral traction pin--the pontoon spica--allows for early cast application and discharge from the hospital and encourages early motion of the knee joint. A series of 23 femur fractures in 21 patients were treated with this method. This series is compared with a series of 38 fractures treated with conventional methods. The follow-up period ranged from three to 24 months. The pontoon method provided better results in control of alignment than the conventional method, with no greater discrepancy in leg lengths than generally observed after skin traction and hip spica casts. The average hospital cost reduction was 73%, or approximately $13,334. There were no major complications with the pontoon method, which is now a standard treatment for femoral fractures in children.\r"

Muscle fatigability also increases rapidly after limb immobilization. Muscles within limbs fixed by plaster casts have lower levels of resting glycogen and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a more rapid depletion of muscle glycogen and ATP during work, a greater increase in lactate during work, and a decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acids during work. The greatest loss of absolute muscle mass occurs at the beginning of muscle wasting with subsequent loss of muscle being exponential. A significant decrease in the rate of protein synthesis in muscles is observable at the sixth hour of limb immobilization, which most likely initiates the net loss of muscle protein. A change in the amount of either translational or elongational factor is most likely responsible for the early decrease in this rate of protein synthesis.\r"

However, such wound complications as may have delayed recovery occurred with a frequency similar to that reported in other series of TKA using different antithromboembolic modalities.\r"

The lateral superior geniculate artery was routinely sacrificed in all knees in which a lateral release was necessary. The results showed no complications associated with a possible loss of blood supply secondary to the lateral release. No increased evidence of osteonecrosis, patellar bone-cement radiolucency, or patellar fracture was discovered. Clinically, there was no difference in pain, ambulation, or range of motion. Seventeen patellar fractures (3.6%) were observed in patients for whom a lateral release had not been performed, yet only one patellar fracture (1.5%) was encountered among the patients who had required a lateral release. In TKA, lateral release was associated with a relatively high degree of patellar tilting.\r"

After an average of 60 months, 48 of the surviving arthroplasties were examined clinically and roentgenographically. At follow-up examination, eight were clinical failures. One-half of the McIntosh and Marmor arthroplasties and one-third of the Attenborough and Guepar arthroplasties, altogether 17 cases, showed signs of potential roentgenographic failure. The majority of the revised TKAs classified as roentgenographic failures were clinically successful or acceptable. Revision of TKAs in noninfected rheumatoid patients can be performed with acceptable clinical results but with a significantly higher failure rate than after primary procedures.\r"

A prospective study was conducted on 20 children with DSFH, using a modified technique to reduce and pin the fracture. All fractures were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. After the fracture was internally fixed, intraoperative anteroposterior roentgenograms of each distal humerus were compared, using Baumann's angle. The reduction was accepted if Baumann's angle on the fractured extremity was within 4 degrees of that on the normal side. If the angles were not within 4 degrees, the closed reduction and percutaneous pinning was repeated. In this prospective series, all patients had a reduction to within 4 degrees of the normal side before they left the operating room. Three weeks after percutaneous pinning, the pins were removed and range of motion was begun. All patients returned for clinical and roentgenographic examination. With an average follow-up period of 17.2 months, all patients had excellent or good results. No patient developed cubitus varus deformity. Strict adherence to the guidelines of the protocol prevented cubitus varus deformity in this series of children with DSFH.\r"

Custom-designed implant TEA was substituted in cases with substantial bony or soft tissue loss. Revision of the polyethylene-bearing component, coupled with the addition of a yolk-type locking mechanism, was implanted when only the bearing system of a well-fixed implant had failed. TEA can be performed successfully with satisfactory durability as a revision procedure. Revision of failed open reduction internal fixation or a failed bearing system was highly successful. Revision of previously infected elbows in a single-stage procedure was unsuccessful in two of three cases and has been abandoned in favor of a staged procedure. A revision of loose TEA was successful in only three of five cases. Further investigations are necessary to improve the function durability of TEA.\r"

  ".W": "The muscle wasting associated with joint damage may be highly selective; knee disorders produce quadriceps wasting but little change in the size of the hamstrings. This causes isolated quadriceps weakness, so predisposing to a position of knee flexion. Nociceptors and other receptors in and around the joint can have flexor excitatory and extensor inhibitory actions. At the knee, these receptors are likely to excite hamstrings and inhibit quadriceps. Although other actions could occur, quadriceps inhibition may be favored by a position of knee extension. Quadriceps inhibition will weaken voluntary contraction, reduce tone, and contribute to wasting of the muscle, further predisposing to a position of knee flexion. The potency of quadriceps inhibition may be considerable, even in the absence of perceived pain. A small, apparently trivial effusion (or even a clinically undetectable effusion) may cause important inhibition. In order to improve the orthopedist's ability to prevent flexion contracture of the injured or operated joint, he must look not only for ways of reducing joint pain, but also for ways of preventing activity in other joint afferents. For example, he must consider the possible effects of joint position, intraarticular pressure, suture-line tension, and afferent blockade.\r"

The Hickman catheter is a safe and effective intravenous access device for long-term antibiotic therapy in patients with osteomyelitis.

  ".W": "A new theory is introduced to describe some of the influences of mechanical stresses on chondroosseous biology. It is proposed that degeneration and ossification is a normal process for all cartilage in the appendicular skeleton, which is accelerated by intermittently applied shear stresses (or strain energy), and inhibited or prevented by intermittently applied hydrostatic pressure. These concepts were applied using finite element computer models in an effort to predict the ossification pattern of the prenatal and postnatal femoral anlage. The theoretical calculations successfully predicted the key features of skeletal morphogenesis including the development of the primary ossification site, a tubular diaphysis and marrow cavity, metaphyseal and epiphyseal trabecular bone, the location and geometry of the growth plate, the appearance and location of the secondary ossific nucleus, and the existence and thickness distribution of articular cartilage. The results suggest that degenerative joint disease in immobilized or nonload-bearing mature joints may be a manifestation of the final stage in the ossification of the anlage. In nonfunctional joints, the absence or reduction of intermittent hydrostatic pressure in the articular cartilage permits cartilage degeneration and the progressive advance of the ossification front toward the joint surface until the articular cartilage has been ossified.\r"

Bilateral cranial trephine defects, measuring 14-20 mm in diameter, were created in three Rhesus monkeys, providing a typical primate model system for investigations in comparative physiology of bone regeneration. Each skull had one control and one experimental trephine defect. Control defects were implanted with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Experimental defects were implanted with 100-200 mg of a partially purified fraction of bovine bone morphogenetic protein (bBMP) in two monkeys. In one monkey, the BMP was incorporated in a 1:1 poly(lactic) poly(glycollic) acid copolymer, high-viscosity formula. The animals were killed at eight weeks, ten weeks, and 16 weeks after implantation. The tissue responses were analyzed by computed histomorphometry and routine histologic examination. At each time interval, the BMP implanted defects produced more complete regeneration than the control implants. The morphogenetic response occurred in the following sequences: mesenchymal cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, and increased bone formation. BMP-induced osteogenesis may initiate the regenerative process. The copolymer releases BMP but may constitute a barrier to the end stages of replacement by new bone, and would be more useful in a low-viscosity rapidly biodegradable form.\r"

A 10% increase in bone mass and a significant increase in the number of small diameter vessels were observed after six weeks. No changes were observed in the tibial subchondral bone, consistent with the measured attenuation of load distal to this joint. No changes were observed in either tibial or calcaneal subchondral bone in the 500-ms load group.

Reduced load-to-failure and reduced energy-absorbing capacity of the bone-ligament-bone complex progresses to about one-third that of controls. Collagen mass declines by about 10%. Collagen turnover increases with accelerated degradation and synthesis. Formation of reducible collagen crosslinks increases.

A similar difference was also found between the tubular and the nontubular bone of an autopsy subject with achondroplasia. There was no statistical difference in the levels of LDH and aldolase in the cartilage between the tubular and the nontubular bone. These observations together with results obtained from iliac and limb cartilages of the newborn rat suggest the hypothesis that CK activity of cartilage of the tubular and the nontubular bone is different; cartilage of achondroplasia tubular bone has CK activity similar to that of normal nontubular bone cartilage.\r"

Medication, splintage, and physiotherapy are useful in helping to suppress and reduce the effects of the disease, but in some patients arthritis attacks in acute episodes, while in others arthritis chronically and relentlessly pursues its destructive course. Surgical treatment, particularly of the soft parts, has a considerable part to play in correcting deformity, maintaining movement, and relieving pain. Timely surgical treatment may also serve to prevent deformity and to maintain function as well as muscle strength so that by the time the child becomes an adult he can lead a normal life.

Although spasticity may be partially responsible for joint contractures, it does not produce most of the functional disability experienced by patients with upper motoneuron lesions. Paresis, fatigability, lack of dexterity, etc., account for most of these patients' complaints. The pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood but appears to be related to an increased excitatory state at the segmental spinal level; there is no evidence for increased sensitivity of muscle spindles in spastic patients. Several mechanisms for this increased excitability within the spinal cord have been proposed. There are different types as well as degrees of spasticity. Clinical neurophysiologic recordings of reflex activity in patients with spasticity provide the means to differentiate among the various types of spasticity, to select the therapy most likely to be effective in a particular patient, and to see the results of its employment objectively. The latter will prove whether a specific therapy is useful or not. Ablative treatment at the level of the peripheral nerve or dorsal root may be useful, particularly when spasticity is severe. Drugs such as baclofen or diazepam relieve flexor spasms but are not particularly effective against spasticity itself. Dantrolene acts to weaken muscles, but that is not often helpful. Rarely do any of these therapies increase function; there are no effective cures for paresis or related negative manifestations of chronic spasticity.\r"

Seventy-five consecutive cases of craniocerebral trauma observed during a one-year period were evaluated as to the duration of coma, degree of paralysis, treatment facility, and presence of fractures including their relation to contractures. Contractures measured by standard goniometric techniques were defined as loss of range of motion in a joint to a degree that impedes activities of daily living. The incidence of contractures was 84%. The most commonly affected joints were the hips (81%), shoulders (76%), ankles (76%), and elbows (44%). There was a statistically significant increase in the presence of contractures with prolonged duration of coma. Patients with contractures that developed independently of the facility where treated were examined for the presence of fractures. The emphasis after acute craniocerebral trauma is on life preservation. Limb positioning and maintenance of joint motion, which are imperative for the functional activity, have not received the attention necessary for the long-range welfare of the patient.\r"

The introduction of home therapy is an important preventive measure, and treatment is primarily by physiotherapy, splintage, and corrective devices. The late or severe case may require surgical correction in the form of soft tissue procedures. Arthrodesis or total arthroplasty must be carried out with meticulous hemostasis and with replacement of the appropriate blood clotting factors.\r"

Ninety-seven percent of children without Hirschsprung's disease and who were biopsied after the neonatal period did not have symptoms during the first 4 weeks of life. Despite having severe symptoms from birth, nine (37.5%) of the children with Hirschsprung's disease were not biopsied until an average age of 15 months. Data indicate that using the presence of bowel symptoms from the neonatal period as criteria for referral for biopsy would have missed none of the children with Hirschsprung's disease. Children with symptoms dating from the neonatal period should be considered for biopsy to avoid potential morbidity and mortality from the complication of enterocolitis.\r"

A recent experience with a child who presented with an apparent acute subcapsular hematoma after TSE and who underwent complicated emergency splenectomy prompted review of the risks and complications of TSE. Although theoretically attractive in many respects, TSE is associated with significant morbidity. The resultant diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of this procedure can potentially complicate patient management, and the often life-threatening sequelae warrant considerable restraint in its use. In addition, TSE often fails to produce the desired, long-term hematologic response. Because of the morbidity and risk associated with TSE, primary operative intervention is advised for most children in whom splenectomy is indicated. Morbidity associated with the direct operative approach may be minimized by judicious use of blood components and by meticulous surgical technique.\r"

Even when the results are clearly negative, the subsequent treatment may proceed as if the film had been positive because of the child's clinical condition. The cumulative effect of such low-dose radiation on infants and children over time is unknown. The number and types of outpatient radiographs received by a cohort of poor children from a hospital-based continuity clinic during their first 5 years of life were reviewed. Also noted were the reason for obtaining the film, whether it was positive for that reason or another, whether the child had a chronic condition that prompted the use of radiograph, and the child's sex, race, and age when the film was obtained. Of the 218 children, 132 (60.6%) received 349 sets of films in their first 5 years. There was no difference in the number of films by race or sex. Chest and posttrauma bone or joint films accounted for 315 sets of films or 90.3% of the total. Overall, 25.8% of the 267 chest films were positive; this varied by age. Only 15% of the chest films were positive in the first year compared with 29 to 49% in the second through fifth years (p less than 0.001). Cough was the respiratory symptom most reliably associated with a positive chest film, both for the cohort (p less than 0.0001) and for children in the first year of life (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initial examination showed tears, scars, and distortion of the hymen, laceration of the perineal body, and loss of normal anal tone. Follow-up evaluations over the next year showed progressive healing. By 7 months after the injury, the hymen was replaced by a thick, opaque scar with no orifice. Patients with an apparent imperforate hymen require a sensitive interview and careful visual inspection of the genital and anal areas to delineate signs of injury. The finding of an apparent imperforate hymen on physical examination does not eliminate the possibility of antecedent vaginal penetration and sexual abuse.\r"

Compared with control, procainamide plasma clearance decreased from 0.43 +/- 0.12 L/kg-hr to 0.33 +/- 0.12 L/kg-hr (P less than 0.01), plasma elimination half-life increased from 3.77 +/- 0.64 hours to 5.21 +/- 0.42 hours (P less than 0.01), and volume of distribution was unchanged from 2.31 +/- 0.74 L/kg to 2.47 +/- 0.90 L/kg during amiodarone treatment. As single agents, intravenous procainamide and oral amiodarone produced equivalent increases in QRS duration, rate-corrected QT interval, right ventricular effective refractory period, and cycle length of induced ventricular tachycardia. After the addition of intravenous procainamide to amiodarone the QRS duration, rate-corrected QT interval, and, in six of eight patients, ventricular tachycardia cycle length were significantly increased compared with control or either drug alone, suggesting additive electrophysiologic effect. However, acceleration of induced ventricular tachycardia occurred in one patient with combined treatment, suggesting a potential for adverse electrophysiologic interactions. These findings indicate that amiodarone has pharmacokinetic and electrophysiologic interactions with procainamide and suggest that the intravenous dose of procainamide be reduced by 20% to 30% during concurrent drug administration.\r"

A 600 mg oral dose of allopurinol was administered after 7 days of a normal diet (100 mg protein/day) and again after 2 and 4 weeks of a restricted diet (19 gm protein/day). The renal clearance of oxipurinol was reduced from 19.6 +/- 1.5 ml/min during the normal diet to 10.9 +/- 0.8 and 12.0 +/- 0.9 ml/min (both P less than 0.001) during the restricted diet at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. These changes in oxipurinol renal clearance paralleled changes in uric acid renal clearance. Furthermore, the plasma oxipurinol half-life was increased from 27.0 +/- 1.7 hours during the normal diet to 51.1 +/- 4.3 and 45.7 +/- 3.7 hours (both P less than 0.001) during the restricted diet at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively.

Each subject received successively each treatment in random order at weekly intervals. The eyedrops administered were as follows: 0.5% timolol, 2% carteolol, 0.6% metipranolol, and placebo. We evaluated the intraocular pressure and systemic beta-blockade 3 hours after a single administration of one eyedrop in each eye. The systemic beta-blocking effect was evaluated by the isoproterenol sensitivity test, that is the dose of isoproterenol required to increase resting heart rate by 25 bpm (I25). Each beta-blocking eyedrop antagonized the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol. I25 for placebo was 3.1 +/- 0.5 micrograms, for metipranolol 5.2 +/- 0.9 micrograms (P less than 0.005), for timolol 10.9 +/- 1.9 micrograms (P less than 0.001), and for carteolol 39.6 +/- 5.4 micrograms (P less than 0.0005). Each treatment significantly decreased the intraocular pressure: metipranolol 3.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), timolol 2.44 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and carteolol 2.38 +/- 0.48 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) compared with placebo. The resting heart rate and blood pressure were not influenced by the treatments. Even though the results might be different in the case of an earlier or a later time of evaluation or chronic administration, we believe that the isoproterenol sensitivity test may be used to evaluate the systemic effect of beta-blocking eyedrops.\r"

Lorazepam, indocyanine green, and antipyrine are used to assess conjugation, liver blood flow, and microsomal oxidative metabolism, respectively. These substrates were administered individually and as a mixture to 10 healthy adult male volunteers to determine if clearances of any of the compounds were affected by simultaneous administration. Mean clearances of the substrates were not different when administered alone (9.97, 0.78, and 0.53 ml/min/kg) vs. together (11.5, 0.89, and 0.52 ml/min/kg), using a paired t test. Since we were using this method to assess hepatic drug clearance in children with leukemia, the effect of short-term allopurinol was assessed. The three model substrates were administered to the volunteers after 0, 1, 8, and 22 days of treatment with allopurinol, 200 mg t.i.d. There was no change in mean clearance of any of the three compounds at any point during allopurinol treatment (repeated-measures ANOVA). We conclude that this technique is a simple and valid method to simultaneously assess three major processes involved in hepatic drug clearance and is not affected by up to 22 days of oral allopurinol treatment. This simple technique, requiring a single set of blood samples, has potential applications in the assessment of developmental changes in hepatic drug clearance, as well as the effects of environmental, therapeutic, and pathophysiologic factors on three major processes involved in hepatic drug clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Adriamycin (ADM) concentrations in neoplastic plasma cells, nucleated blood cells, bone marrow cells, and plasma were measured in seven patients with advanced multiple myeloma. ADM was administered as a 96-hour infusion of 9 mg/m2/24 hr. Maximum plasma ADM concentrations were 15.8 +/- 4.4 ng/ml. ADM concentrations in nucleated blood cells, bone marrow cells, and plasma cells increased continuously throughout the 96-hour infusion. Maximum cellular levels were up to 200-fold higher than the maximum plasma concentration and were similar to levels observed shortly after administration of the total dose in one rapid injection. The cellular AUC for 96-hour infusion and bolus injection were comparable. Thus continuous infusion is the equivalent of bolus injection in delivering ADM to the target cells in bone marrow, although plasma ADM concentrations remained very low. These results provide support for administering ADM as a continuous infusion with less toxicity and better patient tolerance.\r"

Both methods of dose adjustment assume linear drug kinetics. Recent reports have suggested that desipramine kinetics are nonlinear, but the samples described were small, six subjects or fewer. In the current study, plasma desipramine concentrations were examined in 42 inpatients who were depressed who had achieved steady-state conditions with a low initial dose and subsequently with a higher dose. Desipramine concentrations increased significantly more than that predicted by the dose increase; however, only one third of the sample had substantial nonlinear changes (an increase in the concentration 50% greater than expected). In the remainder of the sample, disproportionate increases in plasma concentrations were not likely to be of clinical consequence.\r"

  ".W": "A study was made of changes induced by cholinergic agonists and antagonists in the K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Cl- content of saliva of 22 human subjects with denervated parotid salivary glands. At all stages after denervation there was an increased content of Na+ and Cl- in the secretion of the denervated gland as compared with that of the control glands: after administration of pilocarpine and carbacholine; after administration of a combination of atropine and pilocarpine; in 'paradoxical' salivation induced by atropine, scopolamine, metacine or chlorosyle; in spontaneous secretion; in reflex secretion when this was partially restored. The concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in the secretion of the denervated gland were disproportionately higher than would have been expected from the raised salivation rate. Secretions from the denervated glands by virtue of their increased content of Na+ and Cl- resembled so-called primary saliva. The increased output of Na+ and Cl- and high concentrations of these ions in the secondary saliva after denervation indicates that there is loss of the normal neural control over reabsorption of electrolytes in the epithelium of the glandular ducts. Further, that absence of this control results in disturbances of membrane ionic transport, of membrane permeability and of the metabolism of the gland.\r"

The long-term effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and the influence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) has not been clearly defined. We measured serum lipoproteins during chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris treated with propranolol (without ISA) (n = 21) or pindolol (with ISA) (n = 19). No significant changes occurred in the lipoprotein profile of the patients taking pindolol. In those taking propranolol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) increased at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05) and total high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased at 26 weeks (P less than 0.01) and at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05). However, HDL2 rose significantly at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05). There was a corresponding increase in HDL2/HDL3 ratio. We conclude that pindolol is less likely to exert a harmful effect on plasma lipoproteins than beta-adrenoceptor blockers without ISA.\r"

In non-diabetic subjects there was a marked variability in resting fingertip blood flow which was of similar magnitude to that in diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy. In 20 diabetic subjects with increasing severity of autonomic neuropathy there was a reduction of spontaneous variability in flow (r = 0.59, P less than 0.001), which was not related to differences in basal flow, in skin thickness or in age. There was no relationship between maximal flow and severity of autonomic neuropathy (r = 0.08), although basal flow was decreased in subjects with moderate, but not those with severe, autonomic neuropathy (P less than 0.01 and P less than .04 compared with controls). Our failure to find an increase in basal fingertip flow in autonomic neuropathy could imply that spontaneous variability of anastomic flow is lost before increased arteriovenous shunting becomes apparent, but it could result from the indirect heating employed in the study causing vasodilatation in subjects without neuropathy.\r"

The merits of water suppression by freeze drying or irradiation, and spectral simplification by spin-echo methods, are discussed. Well-resolved resonances for a range of low molecular weight metabolites such as lactate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, acetate, citrate, glucose, valine and formate were observed. Resonances for glutamine were observed only from freeze dried samples. Concentrations determined by n.m.r. were in reasonable agreement with those from conventional methods. The n.m.r. spectra of CSF were related to the clinical conditions of the subjects. No resonances for citrate were present in spectra of CSF from subjects (three infants) with bacterial meningitis; high lactate and lowered glucose levels were observed. Strong resonances for glucose and glycine were observed for mildly diabetic subjects. Both the aromatic and the aliphatic regions of the CSF spectra from subjects suffering from liver failure contained distinctive features characteristic for hepatic coma: Intense resonances for lactate, alanine, valine, methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine. In some cases guanine was also present, which does not appear to have been reported previously. The two-dimensional spectrum suggested the presence of abnormally high levels of a number of endogenous metabolites. Such assignments were not possible using one-dimensional spectra alone because of signal overlap.\r"

Serial changes in urinary protein during 48 weeks after the uninephrectomy and blood chemistries and renal histology at week 48 were compared between the groups. The increase in proteinuria was significantly greater in groups N-0, N-2 and N-4 than in group N-8 from week 32 to week 48 after the uninephrectomy. There was no significant difference in urinary protein between groups N-0, N-2 and N-4. Hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia were also more severe in groups N-0, N-2 and N-4 than in group N-8 at week 48. A compensatory renal growth in groups N-0 and N-4 was significantly greater than that in group N-8 at week 48 after the uninephrectomy. Focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis, a characteristic finding in the uninephrectomy groups, was significantly more marked in groups N-0, N-2 and N-4 than in group N-8 at week 48. We conclude that uninephrectomy at young ages leads to increased incidence of glomerular sclerosis in rats compared with uninephrectomy in the adult.\r"

By dividing the urine [K+] by the urine to plasma osmolality ratio the [K+] in the cortical collecting duct luminal fluid can be estimated; dividing this value by the plasma [K+] yields an index of the transtubular [K+] gradient (TTKG) in vivo. The TTKG was close to 7 in aldosterone deficient ADX rats while on a normal K+ diet and fell towards unity when amiloride or a low K+ diet was administered to these rats. With a longer time on a low K+ diet, the TTKG was less than 1 in ADX rats. This suggests that K+ was reabsorbed in the medullary collecting duct under these conditions. Hyperkalaemia appears to have an 'aldosterone-like' action in the cortical collecting duct in vivo in the absence of aldosterone in ADX rats. This action of hyperkalaemia permits normal K+ excretion rates despite the absence of mineralocorticoids.\r"

The effects of LTD4 were compared with those of histamine and the mechanism of action sought. Thirty-three non-atopic individuals participated in the study. The two drugs were inhaled as an aerosol of small particles causing a relative peripheral deposition pattern in order to mimic the preferential involvement of peripheral airways in asthmatic patients out of attack. LTD4 caused a dose-dependent obstruction of the airways as measured by partial flow-volume curves and volume of trapped gas, yet only minor changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate. LTD4 was 1900-7000 times more potent than histamine. LTD4 inhalations were almost symptomless as opposed to the irritative and dyspnoeic symptoms seen after inhalation of histamine. The time duration for the induced change in partial flow-volume curves was the same for the two drugs. Approximately 30 min elapsed until the bronchial obstruction had decreased by 50% of the maximum effect, and no delayed reaction was observed within 10 h. The reactivity of the airways did not change during 10 h after inhalation of LTD4 as tested by repeated exercise challenges. Pretreatment with ipratropium bromide prevented the effect of LTD4 on FEV1, yet not on partial flow-volume curves. Pretreatment with either cimetidine and mepyramine or with indomethacin, did not affect the bronchial obstruction after LTD4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Con A also bound to enterocytes in a specific manner and was inhibited by alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, confirming a lectin-mediated interaction. 125I-FF-III exhibited quantitatively similar specific binding to both normal human and coeliac enterocytes. The primary interaction of gliadin peptides with the enterocyte surface membrane is not lectin-mediated and unlikely to be of fundamental importance in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.\r"

Heart and brain from BEA rats demonstrated a significant rise in vascular resistance with a normal blood flow.

Six age-matched clinically healthy patients in remission from the minimal change nephrotic syndrome served as controls. The diabetic patients had a higher glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow and a lower venous plasma noradrenaline level in the basal state. They also had a higher systolic blood pressure compared with the controls. During exercise the diabetic patients showed a less marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate and urinary flow and a greater increase in filtration fraction. Their heart rate increase during exercise was lower. An inverse correlation between the percentage changes in noradrenaline and glomerular filtration rate during exercise was noted solely in the diabetic patients. They also showed a less marked increase in the ratio between potassium and sodium clearances during and 20 min after exercise. Albumin excretion did not differ between the two groups. We suggest that the sympatho-adrenergic effects of exercise on heart rate, renal haemodynamics and water homoeostasis are blunted in our diabetic patients. Hence, signs of impaired sympathetic activity might be disclosed in young diabetic patients with a disease of fairly short duration.\r"

Methimazole treatment in utero did not produce significant changes in noradrenaline, dopamine or tyrosine content in either the hypothalamus or striatum. Three weeks' postnatal treatment reduced tyrosine specific radioactivity in the anterior hypothalamus and dopamine specific radioactivity in the striatum. Ten weeks' treatment increased dopamine content and reduced noradrenaline synthesis in the mediobasal hypothalamus and a reduction in tyrosine content in the anterior hypothalamus. These data suggest that hypothyroidism restricted to intrauterine life does not produce permanent changes in adult catecholamine neuronal function. Long term hypothyroidism produced localized changes, suggesting a specific rather than general effect.\r"

This has not been confirmed in man, however, in whom no reduction in the bradycardic response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation has been observed after the mild increase in central venous pressure (right atrial catheter) and cardiopulmonary receptor activity provided by passive leg raising. In seven normotensive subjects carotid baroreceptors were gradedly stimulated by progressively increasing carotid transmural pressure through a neck chamber device, the resulting reflex lengthening in R-R interval being measured in the two-three cardiac cycles immediately after the baroreceptor stimulus. This manoeuvre was performed in control conditions and repeated during a head-out water immersion which increased central venous pressure (right atrial catheter) from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 12.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (mean +/- SE), thereby providing a marked increase in the cardiopulmonary receptor stimulus. In the control condition graded stimulation of the baroreceptors caused a progressive lengthening in R-R interval, the maximal effect being + 477.4 +/- 57.2 ms. Immersion increased the R-R interval from 774.2 +/- 3.2 to 961.6 +/- 5.8 ms (P less than 0.01) and reduced mean arterial pressure (cuff measurement) from 96.0 +/- 1.0 to 82.3 +/- 0.9 mmHg. The changes in R-R interval induced by carotid baroreceptor stimulation were virtually identical with those observed in the absence of immersion.\r"

  ".W": "Early diagnosis is the most effective means of reducing the currently high mortality rate associated with ovarian cancer. A better informed public and profession is aiding in this campaign. The palpation of what appears to be a normal-sized ovary in a premenopausal woman suggests an ovarian tumor in a postmenopausal woman. It is becoming obvious that ovarian cancer is a disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract, and physicians treating ovarian cancer should be prepared to deal with bowel-associated problems. The practice of tapping women with ascites for diagnosis as well as doing an exploration merely to obtain a biopsy should be discouraged. Unless the physician is prepared to carry out the optimal surgical approach for the patient, it is crucial that the patient be referred to either a center or to a physician who is actively engaged in the day-to-day care of cancer patients. Tumor markers such as CA125, alpha-fetoproteins, and human chorionic gonadotropin have been of help in monitoring the management of ovarian cancer. One of the most exciting areas of gynecologic oncology is the effort being made to diagnose ovarian cancer with immunologic techniques as well as treating the patient with immunotherapy. These methods promise a hope for early diagnosis and a method to control the disease without destroying a great deal of normal tissue. With the combined use of all the available treatment methods, patients with ovarian cancer are now living longer and more comfortably.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Needle biopsy permits a definite diagnosis in the majority of cases. Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is treated by surgery, the extent of which would be based on the gross evidence of the extent of the disease, the histologic features of the lesion, the patient's age and overall medical status, and the need to avoid postoperative complications. The appropriate care after surgery is also based on the individual patient. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is best treated by total thyroidectomy with cervical lymph node dissection on the side of a palpable nodule. Serum calcitonin determinations provide diagnostic and some prognostic data. Anaplastic carcinoma is usually best treated by radiation therapy. The outlook is good for most thyroid carcinoma recognized reasonably early.\r"

Most cases (75%) are not occupationally acquired, but due to costume jewelry (31.8%), wrist watches (23.3%), metal clothing buckles (3.4%) including jeans buttons. Job dependent nickel dermatitis is often (36/51 cases) linked with wet work. Atopic dermatitis was found in 8.3% of female nickel allergy. Nickel positivity without a dermatitis history was seen in 9/176 cases (5%). Nickel allergy will become a sex-indifferent phenomenon in Europe, because of the changing customs of adornment.\r"

Reactions were followed by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Allergic reactions showed a normal TEWL after 24-h application, and after 48 h, only strong reactions resulted in increased TEWL. In contrast, irritant reactions showed increased TEWL in both series, irrespective of the strength of the reaction. The deficient water barrier of allergic reactions is secondary, probably resulting from the underlying inflammatory process. Consequently, if TEWL measurements are used for the purpose of differentiating allergic and irritant skin reactions, a short application period, i.e., in this study 24 h, is preferable, with recordings performed shortly after removal of test chambers.\r"

The results obtained by this method were compared with those obtained by other quantitative methods. Tc-PO2 measurement can be regarded as complementary to the laser Doppler technique, since it lacks the sensitivity of the laser Doppler technique in the range in negative to 1+ patch reactions, but it does discriminate between 2+ and stronger reactions.\r"

Eczematous skin was compared with uninvolved skin of the same anatomical region. TEWL of eczematous skin was increased in all patients. In contrast, the conductance was decreased in all patients except for one, who showed equal values in pathological and uninvolved skin. This indicates that the water-holding capacity of eczematous skin is reduced. There was no correlation between clinical grading of scaling, and TEWL and electrical conductance. TEWL and conductance were not correlated, and the 2 methods are therefore supplementary for assessment of eczema and scaling. TEWL may be useful for monitoring the primary effect of therapy, and conductance for the final documentation of healing.\r"

Even in patients allergic to nickel and cobalt simultaneously, the frequencies were comparable. Chromate and PPDA allergy was significantly commoner in nickel sensitive patients (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01). Erythematous or follicular reactions were seen most often to wood tars, propylene glycol, formaldehyde, cobalt, chromate and perfume mix. Reactions to propylene glycol and perfume mix were as frequent in both groups, whereas formaldehyde, cobalt and chromate caused reactions more often in nickel-positive patients (p less than 0.05) and wood tars in negatives (p less than 0.05). Follicular reactions developed especially in patients who were positive to nickel and cobalt. The total number of non-specific reactions was not overpresented in nickel sensitive patients, despite their multiple patch test reactivity.\r"

The arrhythmogenic potential of the combination of salbutamol and theophylline was investigated in 25 ambulatory subjects with severe chronic airflow obstruction (mean age 65 +/- 8 SD, mean FEV1 31 percent +/- 13 SD predicted). Asymptomatic arrhythmias were very prevalent in the study population: 76 percent of the patients had runs of supraventricular tachycardia while 24 percent had runs of ventricular tachycardia. Individual arrhythmia frequency showed greater between-test variability than previously described in non-COPD subjects. The mode of administration of salbutamol may have affected arrhythmia frequency in that subjects using aerosol nebulizers had more ventricular extrasystoles than those using metered dose inhalers. Although the addition of theophylline to salbutamol significantly increased heart rate and supraventricular extrasystoles, there was no statistically significant increase in ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Previous reports have shown that this technique has a high positive but a low negative predictive value. The latter has limited the clinical usefulness of a negative biopsy. To improve the reliability of a negative TNAB, a series of thoracic needle biopsies was done using a team approach, having a cytopathologist, with the necessary equipment to examine the biopsy specimens, in attendance at the biopsy. As biopsy specimens were obtained, they were reviewed to ensure an adequate and representative sampling. The positive predictive value was 98.6 percent and the negative predictive value was 96.7 percent. The high negative predictive value obtained using this approach allows clinical decisions to be based on the results of a negative TNAB.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of 129 consecutive thoracocentesis in 86 patients at a university medical center evaluated the clinical value, complications, and patient experience with thoracocentesis. Pleural fluid analysis in conjunction with the clinical presentation placed 78 pleural fluids into diagnostic categories: definitive 14 (18 percent), presumptive 44 (56 percent), and nondiagnostic 20 (26 percent). Fourteen of 78 (18 percent) of the nondiagnostic fluids were useful, while only six (8 percent) were not useful clinically; therefore, 92 percent of thoracocentesis provided clinically useful information. Using sequential data analysis, initial diagnostic categorizations of eight of 78 patients were upgraded from presumptive or nondiagnostic to definitive based on data available 24 hours following thoracocentesis. Thus, 70 patients were categorized based on the pleural fluid data obtained within the first 24 hours of thoracocentesis. Thirty-four objective complications occurred in 26 of 129 (20 percent) thoracocentesis. The most common complications were pneumothorax, 15 of 129 (12 percent), and cough, 12 of 129 (9 percent). Sixty-five subjective complications occurred in 56 of 123 (46 percent) thoracocentesis. Anxiety, 26 of 123 (21 percent), and site pain, 24 of 123 (20 percent), were the most common subjective complications noted. Thirty technical problems occurred in 129 (23 percent) thoracocentesis with blood contamination, 14 of 129 (11 percent), and dry tap, nine of 129 (7 percent), being the most common. We conclude that diagnostic thoracocentesis is a clinically valuable procedure if used in conjunction with the patient presentation with an understanding of its limitations for providing a specific etiologic diagnosis. When performed by physicians in training, the number of complications are substantial and the operator often underestimates the degree of patient discomfort. Awareness of the clinical value and complications of thoracocentesis should lead to improved use and safety of this procedure.\r"

Both patients showed a very significant improvement of their clinical course, and we conclude that elective use of hyperbaric oxygen in unilateral lung lavages should be considered in these severe cases.\r"

Breathing was more abnormal (153 +/- 87 episodes/night) during decompensation of heart failure and improved with medical therapy (72 +/- 100 episodes/night) (p less than 0.05). Abnormal breathing patterns resolved in three patients, improved in two, and were unchanged in one patient after therapy. Allographic cardiac transplantation in one patient whose sleep study remained unchanged after medical therapy was associated with resolution of breathing pattern abnormalities and severe desaturation during sleep. Therapy-related improvement in nocturnal respiratory events suggests congestive heart failure is a contributing factor for breathing abnormalities and arterial oxygen desaturation during sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical repair of complex thoracic aneurysms requiring aortic valve replacement and coronary revascularization is occasionally complicated by significant bleeding despite the experience of the surgeon. While bleeding from the mediastinal tissues and the anterior suture line is usually easily controlled, posterior bleeding may require dismantling the repair and a second bypass run. The synergism of a second bypass run and continued bleeding may result in increased mortality and/or morbidity. We recently encountered bleeding in a patient who developed ventricular dysfunction after bypass and opted to interpose a Gore-tex graft between the aneurysm wall and the right atrium with immediate hemostasis and a benign course. Subsequently we used four different shunts successfully in 9 of 33 patients. The average bleeding rate 30 minutes after protamine was 221 +/- 60 ml/minute with a range of 190 to 350 ml/minute. The initial two hour chest tube drainage averaged 880 +/- 285 ml with a range of 490 to 1300 ml. There were no re-explorations for bleeding. The shunt in the first patient has remained open without cardiac decompensation. The last patient developed heart failure and required elective repair of a leak at the descending end of an arch replacement. Our experience suggests that these shunts can be effective, particularly if posterior suture line bleeding is encountered.\r"

Therefore, we determined the agreement among four trained observers on the presence of S3 in 81 hospitalized patients. Agreement between pairs of observers varied between 48 and 73 percent. The kappa statistic, which adjusts for agreement by chance alone, showed that agreement between various observer pairs was moderate (kappa = 0.40-0.50) at best and slight (kappa = 0.10-0.30) at worst. The rate of agreement did not appear to be affected by the time interval between measurements, by the sex of the patient or by a training effect over the time of the study. In conclusion, although S3 may be important as a clinical sign, clinicians cannot agree reliably about whether or not it is present.\r"

The effect of aminophylline on regional CBF (rCBF) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not previously been reported to our knowledge. We studied the effect of loading and maintenance infusions of aminophylline on CBF in five subjects with moderate to severe COPD. rCBF was determined in eight homologous regions of each cerebral hemisphere at three intervals: (1) baseline; (2) following the IV loading dose of aminophylline (6.0 mg/kg body weight); and (3) early and late in the maintenance infusion (0.5 mg/kg/hr) period. Aminophylline loading caused a 26 percent reduction (p = 0.005) in mean rCBF from 40.6 +/- 5.2 (SD) ml/100 g/min to 30.1 +/- 6.0 ml/100 g/min. A 23 percent reduction (31.5 +/- 6.9 ml/100 g/min) persisted throughout the maintenance phase. Thus, aminophylline, as customarily used in subjects with COPD, is associated with a significant reduction in rCBF.\r"

In this study, five physicians performed simultaneous, independent scoring of 41 individuals with cystic fibrosis using the Doershuk modification of the Shwachman-Kulczycki scoring system for history, physical examination, and nutrition, and the Birmingham scoring system for chest roentgenograms. These were added together to obtain a clinical score. Interobserver variance of the scores was calculated. Mean individual observer variance from the consensus mean was 1.6-2.9 score points of a possible 25 for each category, 4.5-6.0 of a possible 100 for the total score. Coefficient of variance about the mean was approximately 10 percent for the individual categories, 6.7 percent for the total score. We concluded that the interobserver variance of this scoring system is within acceptable limit for most clinical studies. The total consensus score correlated with the NIH clinical score, chest roentgenogram score alone, and predicted values for forced vital capacity and FEV1 with a high degree of confidence.\r"

An epidemiologic definition of asthma was considered an affirmative answer to the question, \"Have you ever had attacks of asthma?\" The prevalence of asthma ranged from 4 to 12 percent, most often higher in boys with a tendency to increase with age. The relationship between asthma and other allergic respiratory conditions was studied. Some recommendations are made here to improve the validity of data and to increase knowledge about the etiology of asthma.\r"

The prevalence of asthma in Denmark is on the same order as found in national morbidity studies in Britain and the US. The two-peaked prevalence curve suggests that there are two different diseases: childhood asthma, provoked by allergy and temporarily stopping before adulthood, and adult asthma gradually increasing in prevalence until 60 to 70 years of age and due to hyperreactivity. In Denmark, asthma does not appear to be increasing in incidence. With the exception of the very young, seasonal variation is not pronounced and hyperreactivity is thus more dependent on irritants than on seasonally occurring allergens such as pollen. The concomitant prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis was similar to rates reported elsewhere. Problems and limitations of sources of data for epidemiologic studies are discussed.\r"

Asthma is more prevalent among males, those living below the poverty level, persons living in the South and West, and blacks; however, this difference did not attain statistical significance. Death rates from asthma among the older age groups probably increased between 1968 and 1982, with a substantial increase since 1979. For children, the evidence is less clear, but the death rate has increased for children over five years of age during the period from 1979 to 1982. Between 1964 and 1980, asthma has become more prevalent in children under 17 years of age, but this does not reflect an increase in the severity of asthma over this same time period. Hospitalization rates for asthma between 1965 and 1983 increased by 50 percent in adults and by over 200 percent in children. Rates for black patients are 50 percent higher in adults and 150 percent greater in children. It is concluded that there has been a marked increase in hospitalization rates for asthma, a moderate increase in death rates from asthma and a smaller increase in overall prevalence of the disease in the United States.\r"

As reported elsewhere in the world, in children rates were higher in boys than girls, and elderly asthmatic patients have higher rates. Further information on the clinical and etiologic characteristics of asthma in Latin America are presented from a survey of chronic allergic disease conducted in seven Latin American countries. Pre-coded forms were completed during consultations at cooperating allergy departments, and all were analyzed centrally at the Pan American Health Organization. Eighty-six percent of the patients studied were atopic and 46 percent of asthmatic patients had a history of other associated allergic conditions (allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis).

A dawn phenomenon (an 0300 to 0700 h increment in blood glucose) was rather uncommon in our patients (about one-third of profiles), was readily demonstrable in groups of patients only when nocturnal glucose levels were low (less than or equal to 50 mg/dl) or normal (51-100 mg/dl), and was generally not of great magnitude (mean 0700 h glucose levels of 114 mg/dl after 0300 h values of less than or equal to 100 mg/dl). Nocturnal hypoglycemia (0300 h blood glucose of less than or equal to 50 mg/dl, 7% of profiles) was followed by significant increments in blood glucose. However, the 0700 h glucose values averaged only 113 mg/dl and ranged up to only 172 mg/dl. Clearly, the magnitude of this Somogyi phenomenon was not great. Mean glucose levels were not higher at 1100, 1600, or 2100 h the day after nocturnal hypoglycemia than those at the same times the day before hypoglycemia. Thus, nocturnal hypoglycemia does not commonly result in major morning, or daytime, hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus sampled while using their usual therapeutic regimens.\r"

The amount of antibody-bound insulin decreased in a biphasic pattern over 13 mo of observation with an initial half-life of 35 days and a more gradual decrease with a half-life of 160 days.

Seventy-seven consecutive WIB patients were matched for age, sex, known duration of diabetes, and type of treatment of diabetes with 74 Whites from the same diabetes clinic in England. In Jamaica, a systematic random sample (95 women, 36 men) was studied. There was no difference in age at diagnosis between WIBs and Jamaicans. Effort chest pain (possible angina) was less frequent in WIBs (9%) or Jamaicans (3%) than in Whites (25%). Cigarette smoking was more common in WIBs than in Whites but still low in Jamaicans. Body mass index was greatest in WIB women (85%), significantly more than in matched White (52%) or Jamaican women (45%); 40% of White men and WIB men were obese, significantly more than Jamaicans (15% obese). Systolic blood pressure was similar, but diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater in WIBs than in matched White subjects. The prevalence of casual hypertension was high (greater than 40%) in all groups, often despite treatment. Cataracts were significantly more frequent in WIB and Jamaican groups than in Whites. Total background retinopathy after correcting for duration of diabetes did not differ between groups, and there were no significant differences in other complication rates. Levels of HbA1 were lower in Whites than in the other groups. Regression analysis showed that systolic blood pressure was most consistently related to complications, particularly retinopathy, independent of ethnic group and duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Random capillary blood glucose, body weight and height, and income were recorded. The results showed an overall prevalence of 4.3%. There was a rise of prevalence with age and higher-income groups. Prevalence also differed with sex. The overall prevalence in women (5.9%) was twice that for men (2.9%; P less than .001). Obesity occurred in 41.2% of our diabetic subjects compared to 29.3% in nondiabetic subjects (P less than .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis with body mass index (BMI) as the dependent variable showed that sex and income status were significant factors (P less than .0001 and P less than .04, respectively).

Mean duration of hospitalization was 21.3 days, and 19.7% of bed use on medical wards during the survey was by diabetics. More than one-third of known diabetics rarely or never saw a physician until incapacitating symptoms or intercurrent illness resulted in hospitalization. Twenty-one (18%) died, one-third of chronic renal failure. I conclude that diabetes mellitus is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in an Ethiopian hospital, indicating that efficient facilities for outpatient education and stabilization are needed for Ethiopia's diabetics, particularly because inpatient facilities are scarce and resources limited. This is the first report from an African nation of hospitalization patterns of diabetic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relationship between the thickness of the quadriceps muscle capillary basement membrane and diabetic retinopathy. Basement membrane thickness was measured in two groups of patients with long-standing type II diabetes mellitus. One group of patients (N = 13) had no evidence of diabetic retinopathy on fluorescein angiography, whereas the other (N = 12) had proliferative microvascular disease. All the patients were male, and both groups were of similar ages, duration of diabetes, serum creatinines, and glycemic control as reflected by HbA1 levels. Mean muscle capillary basement membrane width (+/- SE) of the patients with proliferative retinopathy (3346 +/- 262) was significantly greater (P less than .05) than that observed in the patients without retinopathy (2660 +/- 177). The results of this study suggest that there is a relationship between capillary basement membrane thickness in skeletal muscle and the severity of microangiopathy in the eye. However, there was a substantial overlap between the two groups, indicating that for any individual patient the measurement of muscle capillary basement width will probably not be useful in identifying the presence or absence of retinopathy.\r"

During a short-term single-blind controlled trial, one daily dose of 20 or 40 mg enalapril significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In the supine position, mean systolic blood pressure declined from 169 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than .01) and mean diastolic blood pressure from 101 +/- 1.5 to 85 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than .001). No changes in heart rate or postural hypotension were observed. During 1 yr of treatment, the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril did not decline, and no clinical side effects were observed. Inhibition by enalapril of angiotensin-converting enzyme did not modify daily insulin requirements, glycemic control, uricemia, or lipid metabolism; kalemia and the markers of diabetic nephropathy were not significantly altered. These results suggest that enalapril once daily should be used as the first step in the treatment of diabetic patients with mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

Because serum albumin and total protein are glycosylated and have short life spans, we investigated the usefulness of glycosylated albumin and glycosylated protein in the detection of gestational diabetes. We studied five groups, each with 20 subjects: nonpregnant and pregnant controls, nonpregnant and pregnant insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients, and gestational diabetic patients. All patients with no history of diabetes had an oral glucose tolerance test to define their carbohydrate status. Our results showed that percent glycosylated albumin and percent glycosylated protein were significantly elevated in both groups of IDDM patients compared with the other groups. However, gestational diabetic patients had glycosylated albumin and glycosylated protein values similar to those of both control groups. Both glycosylated albumin and glycosylated protein correlated well with HbA1c determinations. Thus, glycosylated albumin and glycosylated protein may be a good index of glycemic control, but they are of little value in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes because of a lack of sensitivity: 8 and 3% for glycosylated albumin and glycosylated protein, respectively.\r"

Seven diabetologists from the same institution rated the diabetic control of 125 profiles on a four-point scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = excellent). Six of the 7 diabetologists demonstrated adequate intra- and interrater reliability. Study 2 assessed the reliability of judgments of diabetic control made by diabetologists working in two different settings. There were 9 raters from institution 1 and 8 from institution 2. The impact of the amount and type of information on judgment reliability was evaluated by developing two types of profiles. The test form contained only laboratory and supervised blood or urine test data similar to that utilized in study 1. The history form contained this information as well as other descriptive data typically available to diabetologists. The 17 diabetologists rated 125 anonymous profiles on each of two separate occasions approximately 1 wk apart. On one occasion they rated profiles presented on the test form. On the other occasion they rated profiles presented on the history form. As in study 1, the diabetologist raters demonstrated adequate intra- and interrater reliability. Intrarater reliability was somewhat better when rating test form profiles compared with history form profiles. Reliability was not higher within than between institutions. An analysis of the relative contribution of different diabetes control indices to the diabetologists' judgments indicated that HbA1 influenced raters' judgments at both institutions more than any other single variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Criteria defining appropriate indications for the use of cimetidine for longer than eight weeks were established. Of the 243 patients surveyed, 115 (47 percent) were considered to be inappropriately receiving long-term cimetidine, either because they had never been objectively studied radiographically or endoscopically (23 percent) or had negative results before initiation of therapy (24 percent). Risk factors known to be associated with recurrent peptic ulcer disease were reviewed. Patients fulfilling criteria for appropriate long-term cimetidine usage had a greater prevalence of risk factors compared to the nonjustifiable group. Of particular interest, individuals considered appropriate for long-term therapy were very likely to have had a gastrointestinal bleeding episode prior to beginning therapy (52 percent for gastric ulcer, 8 percent for the nonjustifiable group). This increased prevalence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage may be due to the inherent nature of peptic ulcer disease or a result of physicians selecting affected individuals who may benefit from long-term treatment. Eliminating inappropriate usage of long-term cimetidine in conjunction with a thorough evaluation of risk factors for recurrent ulcer disease can be useful in selecting those individuals most likely to benefit from long-term cimetidine therapy.\r"

The bursts recorded from slices after STIB closely resemble the discharges observed in vivo after kindling and may provide a convenient and accessible model for studies of the electrophysiological underpinnings of epileptiform bursting in local neural circuits. One critical element in the validation of this model is the responsiveness of STIB to traditional sedatives and anticonvulsants. In this study we assessed the effects of the barbiturates phenobarbital and pentobarbital on both spontaneous and stimulus-triggered bursts after STIB. Concentration-response studies indicated that both drugs had inhibitory effects on stimulus-triggered bursting, although at significantly different concentrations. The rate of spontaneous bursting, however, was not significantly affected by phenobarbital at any of the concentrations tested, whereas pentobarbital reduced the frequency of spontaneous bursting in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that STIB is responsive to the barbiturates tested, although the drugs have differential potencies depending on the type of bursting measured. These effects may be the result of differential potencies of these drugs on gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition within local hippocampal circuits, as well as different effects on the biophysical characteristics of pacemaker cells within these circuits.\r"

  ".W": "Because under certain conditions, seizure activity electrically elicited from layers III and IV of the inferior collicular cortex can spread into forebrain regions, potential inferior collicular interactions with the amygdala were studied. Following acute electrical initiation of seizure activity from the inferior colliculus, no changes in amygdala EEG activity were noted. Following repetitive stimulation of the inferior colliculus, however, postictal spiking activity was noted in the amygdala, similar to interictal spiking reported for amygdala kindling, but this abnormal EEG activity did not coincide with any observable behavioral change. Conversely, the course of amygdala kindling in animals previously stimulated in the inferior colliculus progressed quite differently in comparison to control animals. Those animals repetitively stimulated in the inferior colliculus required a significantly greater number of amygdala kindling stimulations to reach class 5 seizure activity than did animals that received no inferior collicular stimulation and, unlike the controls, the chronic inferior collicular stimulation group usually regressed to class 2 or 3 seizure activity after the first class 5 seizure. Furthermore, the chronic inferior collicular stimulation group all exhibited wet-dog shakes during the amygdaloid kindling stimulation, whereas at no time did controls exhibit wet-dog shake behaviors. Finally, the seizure generalization from the inferior colliculus appears to be mediated by a mechanism distinct from the acute seizure activity, because a dose of diazepam (0.4 mg/kg), or carbamazepine (10 mg/kg), which had no effect on the wild running seizure, blocked behaviors indicative of seizure generalization. The significance of these results to epilepsy is discussed.\r"

This study evaluated the hypothesis that \"naive\" embryonic neural tissue implanted into previously kindled animals will alter subsequent seizure susceptibility. At age 16 days, male rats were electrically kindled in the right amygdala (AM). Following kindling (age 19 days), rats underwent either transplants of embryonic neocortical tissue into the left dorsal hippocampus or a sham procedure. At age 84 days, both groups underwent transfer kindling in the left AM. In addition, two other groups of 19-day-old pups that had had electrode implantation in the right AM without subsequent kindling received either embryonic neocortical implants in the left dorsal hippocampus or a sham procedure and were kindled in the left AM for the first time at age 84 days. There were no differences in rate of kindling between the animals that received successfully grafted transplants and those that underwent sham procedures. Using the kindling model, transplantation of embryonic neocortical tissue into the hippocampus does not significantly alter seizure susceptibility in the host animal.\r"

The indexes demonstrated that the early phase of cryogenic epilepsy is a very rapid phenomenon during the first 4 h postlesion. Epileptic activity precedes brain edema, and in individual animals, there is a significant positive correlation between the total amount of epileptic activity and the total amount of edema. The relationship between epileptic activity and brain edema are most likely interrelated at the level of pathophysiological mechanisms and several mechanisms can be postulated.\r"

This has led to the creation of a great variety of \"epilepsies\" and a proposal to establish an International Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes. The assumptions underlying the proposed classification were reviewed, and it was pointed out that in spite of the differences in manifestations and etiologies there may be an underlying commonality. The suggestion is made that epilepsy may be viewed as a process that can express itself in various degrees of intensity, and a definition is proposed that takes into account not only the ictal but also the interictal phenomena. The implications for future research directed toward the solution of the epilepsy problem are discussed.\r"

Effective health care facilities have been operating in the community since 1963. Primary health care workers and nondoctor personnel administered a complete census, a screening questionnaire, and a simple screening neurologic examination. The pretested screening questionnaire had been shown in a pilot study to have a sensitivity of 95% for identifying those with epilepsy. Individuals positive on the screening phase of the survey were evaluated by neurologists and neurosurgeons, who used well-defined criteria to make the diagnosis. There were 101 (48 males and 53 females) who suffered from active epilepsy (5.3 cases/1,000) on prevalence day. The highest age-specific prevalence ratios occurred in those below age 20. The most common of the identifiable seizure types was complex partial seizures (52 cases). The prevalence ratio of epilepsy in this Nigerian town (with an effective health care system) is similar to that reported in some developed countries and several times lower than figures derived from studies in developing countries. These data suggest that an improved health care system would probably reduce the prevalence and burden of epilepsy in developing countries.\r"

Differences in CBZ and CBZ-E disposition between day and night dosing were minor. Mean plasma CBZ concentrations were higher and CBZ-E/CBZ ratios were lower in the monotherapy patients. Variations in total and free plasma CBZ levels were comparable in the monotherapy and polypharmacy groups. Peak free and total CBZ concentrations coincided at approximately 4 h postdose. Free CBZ levels correlated significantly with total in each patient. The extent of variation in total plasma CBZ concentration during 24 h correlated significantly with antipyrine clearance in the monotherapy group. Circadian rhythms are unlikely to influence CBZ disposition to a clinically relevant extent. Measurement of peak and trough CBZ concentrations should improve the value of therapeutic drug monitoring. The diurnal variation in CBZ concentration appears related to the degree of autoinduction of metabolism and is substantial enough to warrant the development of a slow-release preparation of the drug.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether glycosylation of circulating immunoglobulins is related to the decrease of antibody activity in diabetic patients. Thirty-five patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes and 14 age-matched normal controls were examined. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vivo was measured by two different techniques, colorimetry and affinity chromatography. The levels of glycosylated IgG were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in normal controls. To evaluate the antibody activity of glycosylated IgG, anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers after in vitro glycosylation of IgG and antibody titers before and after in vivo immunization with influenza vaccine were determined. IgG specific for streptolysin O purified by affinity chromatography decreased ASO titers after in vitro glycosylation. In diabetic patients, serum titers of hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody against influenza viruses 4 wk after initial immunization were significantly lower than those in normal controls. These results indicate that serum IgG in diabetic patients was nonenzymatically glycosylated, and this modification in vivo might be associated with its functional alteration.\r"

Teachers spend 2.4 half days per week providing direct patient care and 3.1 half days per week supervising residents. Approximately 90% attend on an inpatient family medicine service, while about 60% admit and manage patients by themselves. A minimum of 2.3 half days per week of providing direct patient care was felt to be necessary to maintain clinical skills. Direct patient care was felt to be the single most important activity in maintaining clinical skills. While statistical differences among residency types existed, the faculty of the various types of residency programs had very similar practice profiles and opinions as to the maintenance of their clinical skills.\r"

The strength of the Academy resides in an active and growing membership, and concerns about membership should be identified and addressed. This paper describes the AAFP membership in four midwestern states: Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Wisconsin. The age distribution and medical school location patterns of members are presented. In Illinois, almost half the members either currently are or will be 65 years or older within the decade. In the other three states, the comparable pool is only 38%. In Illinois, half the members attended an Illinois medical school and one-third are foreign medical school graduates. In Indiana and Iowa, the vast majority of members are graduates of Indiana and Iowa medical schools, respectively. Wisconsin profits from both its own graduates and from the attraction of physicians trained in other states. Discussion focuses on the needs facing the chapters and on variables that might be important for increasing membership.\r"

One reason is that the available histologic criteria are not adequate to separate patients with lesser degrees of dysplasia or predysplastic changes who are at increased risk for carcinoma and therefore require more frequent surveillance from those patients who are not at increased risk. We used flow cytometry and histology to evaluate 317 biopsy specimens from 64 consecutive patients who were in a cancer surveillance program for Barrett's esophagus and 3 additional patients with adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Specimens from 10 patients had aneuploid cells; 9 of these had dysplasia or carcinoma, or both, but 1 patient had only specialized metaplastic epithelium. Twenty specimens ahd G2/tetraploid fractions greater than 6%; all 20 came from patients who had cancer or dysplasia, or were indefinite for dysplasia. All patients with dysplasia or adenocarcinoma had evidence of genomic instability (aneuploidy) or abnormalities of mucosal proliferation by flow cytometry, even when the dysplasia was focal or difficult to recognize histologically. In a small subset of patients with specialized metaplastic epithelium whose specimens were histologically negative or indefinite for dysplasia, the mucosa had aneuploid cell populations or proliferative abnormalities that were otherwise found only in dysplasia or carcinoma. Additional study may prove that this subset of patients merits more frequent endoscopic biopsy surveillance because of an increased risk for developing carcinoma. Because the abnormalities we have detected by flow cytometry correlate well with the conventional histologic diagnoses of dysplasia and carcinoma, they may prove to be a valuable objective adjunct in the diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.\r"

The metenkephalin analogue (40 micrograms i.v.) significantly decreased the fundic accommodation to distention. In doses ranging from 20 to 60 micrograms i.v. it induced a premature phase III of the migrating motor complex that started ectopically in the duodenum (without a gastric component) and migrated distally at a significantly higher velocity than a spontaneous phase III.

We recently evaluated laser-Doppler velocimetry for use in the stomach and found it to yield continuous, superficial measurements of either mucosal or muscularis blood flow. In the present study, simultaneous measurements of total, mucosal, and muscularis blood flows and arteriovenous oxygen difference were made during step decreases in perfusion pressure in chambered segments of resting canine stomach. As perfusion pressure was decreased from 180 to 35 mmHg, oxygen consumption remained relatively constant at 1.5 ml/min X 100 g and only became blood flow-dependent when perfusion pressure was set below 90 mmHg and total blood flow fell below 35 ml/min X 100 g. Oxygen consumption was maintained partly by increased oxygen extraction; however, there was also a progressive increase in the tendency for total blood flow autoregulation after each drop in perfusion pressure. Mucosal blood flow was also well autoregulated over the physiologic range of perfusion pressure and remained relatively constant during the plateau portion of the oxygen consumption curve. Our results indicate that in the resting stomach, oxygen consumption is maintained by changes in oxygen extraction in conjunction with autoregulation of mucosal and total blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to examine the influence of the commonly used antidiarrheal agent loperamide on the internal anal sphincter of anesthetized opossums. Loperamide caused a rise in internal anal sphincter pressures, and a decrease in the rectal distention-induced internal anal sphincter relaxation. To define the mechanism of decrease in the rectal distention response of the internal anal sphincter, we examined the effects of sacral efferent nerve stimulation, local intramural stimulation, and ganglionic stimulant (which acts at the postganglionic inhibitory neuron). Loperamide caused a significant decrease in the internal anal sphincter relaxation caused by sacral nerve stimulation, but not in that caused by local intramural stimulation and nicotine. These effects of loperamide on the internal anal sphincter were antagonized by naloxone. These findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of loperamide on the internal anal sphincter as an antidiarrheal agent are due to a rise in the tone of the sphincter and the inhibition of its relaxation in response to rectal distention. Both of these actions are mediated by activation of opioid receptors. The inhibition of internal anal sphincter relaxation induced by rectal distention (which mimicks recto-anal reflex) is due to inhibition of release of neurotransmitter from the preganglionic sacral nerve fibers.\r"

  ".W": "To estimate vascular changes in chronic liver disease, we quantitated intrahepatic arteriovenous and portal-systemic shunts in 12 patients with cirrhosis and arteriovenous shunts alone in 4 patients with cirrhosis. An index was obtained for intrahepatic arteriovenous shunts by instilling technetium 99m-macroaggregated albumin into the proper hepatic artery and portal-systemic shunts, by the same procedure done in the portal trunk, near the porta hepatis on different days. Counts were taken over the liver and both lungs in the anterior as well as the posterior view for calculation of the shunt index: cpm in lungs divided by cpm in liver and lungs X 100%. In the 12 patients with cirrhosis in whom both shunts were measured, intrahepatic arteriovenous shunting was significantly lower compared with intrahepatic portal-systemic shunting (1.4% +/- 1.1% vs. 36.0% +/- 29.0%, p less than 0.001). Thus, it seems that in patients with cirrhosis, the development of intrahepatic arteriovenous shunts is not as great as that of portal-systemic shunts, which were found in this study to be considerable and variable in degree.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic cirrhosis produced by repeated inhalation of carbon tetrachloride is associated with reduced levels of microsomal cytochrome P450. In this study the C19-steroids androstenedione and testosterone were used as specific probes of the functional activity of several forms of cytochrome P450 in microsomal fractions from control and cirrhotic rat liver. The principal finding, that androstenedione 16 alpha-hydroxylation and testosterone 2 alpha-, 16 alpha-, and 17 alpha-hydroxylation were reduced to 14%-38% of control activity, strongly suggests that levels of the male sexually differentiated cytochrome P450 (P(450)16 alpha) are decreased in hepatic cirrhosis. The activity of other cytochrome P450-mediated C19-steroid hydroxylases, with the exception of androstenedione 6 beta-hydroxylase, appeared essentially unaltered in microsomes from cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride was also associated with greatly decreased activity of the microsomal cytochrome P450-independent 17 beta-oxidoreductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone. Consequently, and in view of the impaired activity of cytochrome P450-mediated testosterone 17 alpha-hydroxylation, the capacity of cirrhotic microsomes to catalyze the interconversion of androstenedione and testosterone was much lower than that of control microsomes. The present data confirm and extend earlier observations that selective impairment of drug oxidation pathways occurs in hepatic cirrhosis. These changes are unrelated to the acute toxicity produced by carbon tetrachloride exposure. The available evidence supports the assertion that specific forms of cytochrome P450 are subject to altered regulation in cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate a possible role for reduction of intrahepatic vascular space in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension, we studied a partially hepatectomized rat model in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro study used livers from normal, 1/3-hepatectomized, and 2/3-hepatectomized rats, and rats with cirrhosis caused by chronic bile duct ligation, for isolated, perfused flow-pressure plotting. Resistance to perfusion increased such that significant differences were found between all groups except the last two, which showed similar resistances. The in vivo study measured splanchnic blood flow by radioactive microspheres and portal pressure in anesthetized sham-operated and 1/3- and 2/3-hepatectomized rats. Although absolute portal tributary blood flows did not change, portal flow per gram of remnant liver showed significant increases: 1.57 +/- 0.32 ml/min X g liver, 2.52 +/- 0.60 ml/min X g liver, p less than 0.01; 3.48 +/- 1.04 ml/min X g liver, p less than 0.01, respectively. Although intrahepatic resistance increased significantly only in the 2/3-hepatectomized group, portal pressures increased significantly in both groups of hepatectomized rats: normal, 7.5 +/- 1.1 mmHg; 1/3-hepatectomized, 9.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg; and 2/3-hepatectomized, 11.1 +/- 1.2 mmHg. Thus, decreased intrahepatic vascular space caused by resection and hepatocellular hypertrophy leads to portal hypertension, thereby suggesting that this reduction in space may be the pathogenic factor common to a number of different theories of portal hypertension.\r"

Portal pressure, arterial pressure, and regional and systemic blood flows were measured in a rat model of portal hypertension receiving placebo or vasopressin infusion. Effects of the drugs were compared in control rats and rats subjected to hemorrhage and blood transfusion. In a stable portal hypertensive rat group (no hemorrhage or transfusion) a standard vasopressin dose, 2.5 mU X kg-1 X min-1, resulted in a significantly lower portal pressure (11.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 14.4 +/- 0.6 mmHg) with a concomitantly lower portal venous inflow (8.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 0.6 ml X min-1 X 100 g body wt-1) when compared with rats receiving placebo. These findings are in contrast to the effects obtained with the same dose of vasopressin given during blood transfusion to hemorrhaged portal hypertensive rats. The standard dose of vasopressin had no effect on any of the splanchnic or systemic circulatory parameters. Only when a dose of vasopressin 10 times larger was used in the hemorrhaged-transfused animals were hemodynamic effects noted. A significant decrease in portal flow and pressure was noted. These findings suggest that vasopressin given during hemorrhage may be less effective than when given during a stable state. Larger doses of vasopressin may be needed during hemorrhage to produce the same effect as seen during a controlled stable state. Caution should be used in extrapolating the results of pharmacologic studies in stable portal-hypertensive models to hypovolemic states in humans.\r"

Therefore, we compared the effects of oral nifedipine (10-30 mg t.i.d.) and placebo in 20 patients (mean age 50 yr) with chronic noncardiac chest pain and the nutcracker esophagus in a 14-week double-blind crossover study. Compared to placebo, nifedipine significantly decreased distal esophageal contraction amplitude (mean +/- SEM, 198 +/- 11 mmHg to 123 +/- 9 mmHg; p less than 0.005), as well as duration and lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Nifedipine, however, was no better than placebo in the relief of daily chest pain frequency, severity, or index (frequency X severity) as assessed by patient diaries. Despite these disappointing results, long-term follow-up (mean, 16.6 mo) suggests these patients do improve. Mean daily chest pain index significantly (p less than 0.005) decreased from 10.3 +/- 2.0 at the beginning of the study to 3.2 +/- 0.8 at follow-up. Prescription drug use and physician visits for chest pain also significantly decreased. Distal esophageal contraction pressures significantly fell during the long-term follow-up but there was poor correlation with chest pain improvement. This study suggests that identification of the esophagus as the cause of chest pain coupled with supportive intervention may be more effective than drug therapy in improving these patients' chest pain.\r"
