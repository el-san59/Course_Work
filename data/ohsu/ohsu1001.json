  ".W": "The relation between ambulatory myocardial ischemia and the results of exercise testing in patients with ischemic heart disease remains undefined, because of the dissimilar results of previous reports. To further investigate this issue and, in particular, to ascertain the importance of the exercise protocol in determining that relation, 70 patients with stable coronary artery disease underwent 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and treadmill exercise tests after withdrawal of medications. Patients exercised using two different protocols with slow (National Institutes of Health [NIH] combined protocol) and brisk (Bruce protocol) work load increments. Exercise duration was longer with the NIH combined protocol (14.1 +/- 5 versus 6.8 +/- 2 min; p less than 0.0001), but the maximal work load and peak heart rate achieved were greater with the Bruce protocol (9.8 +/- 2 versus 6.5 +/- 2 METs, and 142 +/- 19 versus 133 +/- 22 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.0001). A close inverse correlation between exercise testing and the results of ambulatory ECG monitoring was observed using the NIH combined protocol; the strongest correlation was observed between time of exercise at 1 mm of ST segment depression and number of ischemic episodes (r = -0.86; p less than 0.0001). With the Bruce protocol a significantly weaker inverse correlation was found (r = -0.35). The mean heart rate at the onset of ST segment depression was similar during monitoring and during exercise testing with the NIH combined protocol (97.2 +/- 13 versus 101.0 +/- 17 beats/min, respectively) but it was significantly higher (110.4 +/- 13) when using the Bruce protocol (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate how the diagnostic accuracy of a stress echocardiographic procedure, such as a dipyridamole echocardiography test, depends on the specific experience of the physician interpreting the test. Recordings of 50 consecutive dipyridamole echocardiographic tests were selected for the first part of the study. They were analyzed by 20 experienced echocardiographers with different backgrounds in stress echocardiography: 10 beginners (less than 20 stress studies interpreted with trained staff) and 10 experienced observers (greater than or equal to 100 stress studies performed). Diagnostic accuracy (true positive + true negative/total number of tests) versus the angiographic reference standard (greater than 70% coronary stenosis of at least one major coronary artery) was 62 +/- 6% for beginners and 85 +/- 3% for experienced observers (p less than 0.0001). In the second part of the study, 10 observers (5 beginners and 5 experienced observers) evaluated 2 different sets of 50 dipyridamole echocardiographic test studies before and after the training of the beginners. Before training, the accuracy of beginners was lower than that of experienced observers (61 +/- 7% versus 85 +/- 3%; p less than 0.001). After training, the accuracy gap was closed (83 +/- 3% versus 86 +/- 2%; p = NS). Therefore, interpretation of stress echocardiographic tests by an echocardiographer without specific training severely underestimates the diagnostic potential of this technique. One hundred stress echocardiographic studies are more than adequate to build the individual learning curve and reach the plateau of diagnostic accuracy that the test can yield.\r"

The value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and the amount of ischemic myocardium in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were determined. Forty-one patients were asymptomatic after angioplasty; 77% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Seventy-five patients had chest pain after angioplasty; 99% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Restenosis occurred in 61% of asymptomatic and 59% of symptomatic patients and in 46% of the vessels in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of restenosis by SPECT in individual patients were 96%, 75% and 88% versus 91%, 77% and 85%, respectively, in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic groups (p = NS). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for restenosis detection in individual vessels were 90%, 89% and 89% versus 84%, 77% and 84%, respectively, in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups (p = NS), with similar results for the three major arteries. Sensitivity and accuracy of exercise ECG were significantly less than those of SPECT imaging for the patients with silent (40% and 44%) and symptomatic (59% and 64%) ischemia (p less than 0.001). Restenosis of vessels in the patients with silent and symptomatic ischemia was associated with an equal amount and degree of severity of ischemic myocardium in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91131905\r", 
  ".W": "Fifteen consecutive patients with drug-refractory, recurrent, sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and a history of remote myocardial infarction underwent catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia. Shocks of 100 to 300 J were delivered to sites at which pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in concealed entrainment, in which the ventricular tachycardia accelerated to the pacing rate, there was a long stimulus to QRS interval and there was no change in the configuration of the QRS complex during pacing at several rates compared with the configuration during ventricular tachycardia, thus identifying a zone of slow conduction in the reentrant circuit. Concealed entrainment was demonstrated in nine (60%) of 15 patients, and the stimulus to QRS intervals were 90 to 400 ms. At sites of concealed entrainment, the endocardial activation time relative to the QRS complex during ventricular tachycardia ranged from -125 to +50 ms, the timing of the local electrogram relative to the QRS complex was the same during entrainment as during ventricular tachycardia and the pace map during sinus rhythm was discordant with that of the ventricular tachycardia in seven patients. In the six patients in whom a site of concealed entrainment could not be identified, the target site for ablation was selected on the basis of identification of an isolated mid-diastolic potential, activation mapping and pace mapping. The mean (+/- SD) cumulative number of joules delivered to the target site was 306 +/- 140. A successful long-term clinical outcome was achieved in 9 of the 15 patients (mean follow-up 20 +/- 7 months). The clinical success rate was the same whether the target site was selected on the basis of concealed entrainment (five of nine, 56%) or on the basis of the other mapping techniques (four of six, 67%). In conclusion, the responses to pacing suggest that sites at which there is concealed entrainment may be located within a zone of slow conduction in the ventricular tachycardia reentry circuit, although not necessarily in an area critical for the maintenance of reentry. The long-term clinical efficacy of catheter ablation targeted to sites of concealed entrainment is about 60%, similar to the results achieved when conventional mapping techniques are used.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of standing on induction of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, electrophysiologic studies were performed in both the supine and standing positions in 22 patients with atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia and in 11 with AV node reentrant tachycardia. AV reciprocating tachycardia was induced in 9 of the 22 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 17 when standing. The effective refractory period of the AV node markedly shortened, from 275 +/- 72 to 203 +/- 30 ms (n = 16, p less than 0.005) after standing. The effective refractory period of the accessory pathway shortened slightly, from 293 +/- 75 to 278 +/- 77 ms (n = 8, p less than 0.005), after standing. AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced in 3 of the 11 patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 6 when standing. The effective refractory periods of the slow pathway and fast pathway shortened markedly, from 293 +/- 72 to 216 +/- 40 ms (n = 6, p less than 0.025) and from 416 +/- 85 to 277 +/- 50 ms (n = 10, p less than 0.005), respectively, after standing. Plasma norepinephrine levels increased during standing both in patients with AV reciprocating and in those with AV node reentrant tachycardia (n = 11, p less than 0.005, n = 8, p less than 0.005, respectively). In conclusion, standing, which is associated with increased sympathetic tone, changed the electrophysiologic properties of the reentrant circuits, facilitating induction of AV reciprocating tachycardia and AV node reentrant tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to compare, both subjectively and objectively, four modern rate-responsive pacing modes in a double-blind crossover design. Twenty-two patients, aged 18 to 81 years, had an activity-sensing dual chamber universal rate-responsive (DDDR) pacemaker implanted for treatment of high grade atrioventricular block and chronotropic incompetence. They were randomly programmed to VVIR (ventricular demand rate-responsive), DDIR (dual chamber demand rate-responsive), DDD (dual chamber universal) or DDDR (dual chamber universal rate-responsive) mode and assessed after 4 weeks of out-of-hospital activity. Five patients, all with VVIR pacing, requested early reprogramming. The DDDR mode was preferred by 59% of patients; the VVIR mode was the least acceptable mode in 73%. Perceived \"general well-being,\" exercise capacity, functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the VVIR than in dual rate-responsive modes. Exercise treadmill time was longer in DDDR mode (p less than 0.01), but similar in all other modes. During standardized daily activities, heart rate in VVIR and DDIR modes underresponded to mental stress. All rate-augmented modes overresponded to staircase descent, whereas the DDD mode significantly underresponded to staircase ascent. Echocardiography revealed no difference in chamber dimensions, left ventricular fractional shortening or pulmonary artery pressure in any mode. Cardiac output was greater at rest in the dual modes than in the VVIR mode (p = 0.006) but was similar at 120 beats/min. Beat to beat variability of cardiac output was greatest in VVIR mode (p less than 0.0001), with DDIR showing greater variability than DDD or DDDR modes (p less than 0.05). Mitral regurgitation estimated by Doppler color flow imaging was similar in all modes, but tricuspid regurgitation was significantly greater in VVIR than in dual modes (p less than 0.03). Subjects who preferred the DDDR mode and those who found the VVIR mode least acceptable had significantly greater increases in stroke volume when paced in the DDD mode than in the ventricular-inhibited (VVI) mode at rest (22%) when compared with subjects who preferred other modes (2%, p = 0.03). No other objective variable was predictive of subjective benefit from any rate-responsive pacing mode. Thus, dual sensor rate-responsive pacing (DDDR) is superior objectively and subjectively to single sensor (VVIR, DDIR and DDD) pacing and subjective benefit from dual chamber rate-augmented pacing is predictable echocardiographically.\r"

The effect of patch electrode polarity on the defibrillation threshold was prospectively evaluated. Two large epicardial patches were used. Initial polarity was selected at random. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by direct current and a preestablished defibrillation protocol employed to assess the minimal energy that would reproducibly defibrillate the heart. Nineteen patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with the inferior left ventricular patch as an anode and nine patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with this patch as a cathode. In general, the defibrillation threshold was lower when this patch was used as an anode than when it was used as a cathode (18 +/- 10 versus 22.6 +/- 12.2 J; p less than 0.01). No preoperative variable predicted optimal polarity. Therefore, the effect of patch polarity on defibrillation threshold should be assessed in each patient at the time of AICD implantation so that the safety margin for satisfactory device function can be maximized.\r"

The aortic valve was tricuspid in 170 (91.4%), bicuspid in 14 (7.5%) and unicuspid in 2 (1.1%). Among the 16 patients with aortic dissection and a congenitally malformed valve, the age at death ranged from 17 to 82 years (mean 52) and 13 (81%) were men. The entrance tear of the aortic dissection was located in the ascending aorta in all 16 patients with a malformed valve but in only 68% of those with a tricuspid aortic valve. The aortic valve was stenotic in 6 of the 16 patients with a congenitally malformed valve. Fatal rupture of the false channel occurred after acute ascending aortic dissection in each of the 11 patients (none with healed dissection) who did not have operative therapy for the dissection. Two of the 16 patients with a malformed valve compared with no patient with a tricuspid aortic valve had aortic isthmic coarctation. Histologic sections of aorta from 10 patients disclosed severe degeneration of the elastic fibers of the media in 9 patients. Thus, a congenitally malformed aortic valve appears to be present at least 5 times more frequently in adults with than in those without aortic dissection, and in our patients the entrance tear was always in the ascending aorta, which usually had severe loss of elastic fibers in its media.\r"

Reported alcohol intake and left ventricular mass measured by echocardiography were evaluated in 1,980 men and 2,511 women 17 to 90 years of age and free of cardiovascular disease in the Framingham offspring and cohort study. The relation of reported alcohol intake to left ventricular mass was assessed by gender-specific multivariate regression analysis adjusting for age, height, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, history of hypertension and cigarette smoking. Alcohol intake was positively associated with left ventricular mass in men (p less than 0.01) but not in women (p = 0.64). When stratified by beverage type, beer and wine in both men and women and liquor in men were positively related to left ventricular mass. The lack of association of total alcohol intake to left ventricular mass in women appeared to be due to a negative association (p less than 0.01) with liquor. The strongest positive associations were with wine in men (p less than 0.001) and beer in women (p less than 0.05). Alcohol use is independently associated with left ventricular mass; this association may vary by beverage type. In persons with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy, excessive alcohol intake should be considered.\r"

No patient died during or after operation. Intraoperative postbypass echocardiography documented a good result in nine patients but severe tricuspid regurgitation in one patient, who then underwent prosthetic valve replacement during a second period of cardiopulmonary bypass. Two of four patients who had had right ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction in the early postoperative period showed improved papillary muscle function with concomitant reduction of tricuspid regurgitation 6 months later. All patients were evaluated clinically and by echocardiography 2 to 23 months later. All patients showed clinical improvement, seven by one functional class and three by two classes. All were in sinus rhythm. The mean cardiothoracic ratio decreased by 6% (p less than 0.05). On bicycle ergometry performed in six patients, peak oxygen consumption exceeded 20 ml/kg per min in five. Tricuspid regurgitation diminished in eight patients (by three grades in two patients, by two grades in five and by one grade in one patient); it remained unchanged in two. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative pulsed Doppler flow velocities across the pulmonary valve showed an increase in the peak velocity of flow across the valve (mean 83 +/- 14 versus 97 +/- 11 cm/s, p less than 0.005) and a decrease in the time to peak velocity (mean 130 +/- 16 versus 91 +/- 23 ms, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and minute ventilation were monitored continuously. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained before testing to calculate the right ventricular inflow volume indexed to body surface area. All patients achieved maximal aerobic capacity based on their ventilatory patterns and respiratory exchange ratio. Maximal heart rate was reduced (175 beats/min; 87% of predicted for age) and maximal oxygen consumption was decreased (31 ml/kg per min; 75% of predicted for age and gender). There was no correlation between maximal oxygen consumption and maximal heart rate. Right ventricular volume index, however, had a significant inverse correlation with maximal heart rate (r = -0.62, p less than 0.005). There was no correlation between right ventricular volume index and heart rate at rest. These results suggest that decreased maximal oxygen consumption in patients after the Mustard procedure is not a result of chronotropic impairment. Right ventricular dilation may be a compensatory response to chronotropic impairment.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of captopril and placebo were compared in 18 patients with chronic heart failure and angina pectoris with use of a double-blind crossover trial design. Symptoms were assessed by patient treatment preference, visual analogue scores and nitroglycerin consumption. Exercise performance was assessed using two different treadmill protocols of different work intensity with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and by supine bicycle exercise and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography. Arrhythmias were assessed by 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients generally preferred placebo to captopril, and this appeared to be due to an increase in symptoms of angina with captopril. Treadmill exercise time on a high intensity protocol was shorter with captopril than with placebo; on a low intensity protocol, angina became a more frequent limiting symptom even though overall exercise performance was not changed. The heart rate-blood pressure product was reduced, but largely because of a reduction in blood pressure rather than in heart rate. During supine bicycle exercise, no differences in symptoms, exercise performance, ejection fraction or changes in blood pressure were noted and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced. Captopril does not appear to be clinically useful in alleviating angina pectoris in patients with heart failure, and this effect may be related to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure. Nonetheless, desirable metabolic effects, a reduction in arrhythmias and potential effects on survival require further study of captopril in patients with both angina and heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Despite 200 years of use, the ability of digitalis glycosides to improve exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure remains controversial, partly because of imprecise end points and suboptimal study design. Therefore, this question was examined in 10 ambulatory patients (8 men and 2 women) aged 46 to 70 years (mean 57.8) in sinus rhythm with mild to moderate chronic stable congestive heart failure due to coronary artery disease and systolic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 32 +/- 12). All underwent maximal treadmill exercise with respiratory gas analysis and upright cycle ergometry with gated radionuclide angiography after 4 weeks of digoxin or placebo therapy, administered in a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. Neither treadmill exercise duration (7.7 +/- 2.3 versus 7.3 +/- 2.7 min) nor peak oxygen consumption (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 18.4 +/- 5.4 ml/kg per min) differed between digoxin and placebo regimens. However, the change in peak oxygen consumption induced by digoxin was inversely related to the peak oxygen consumption during placebo therapy (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05). At maximal treadmill effort, heart rate (138 +/- 16 versus 141 +/- 21 beats/min), oxygen pulse (10.3 +/- 2.1 versus 9.9 +/- 2.2 ml/beat), ventilation (40.3 +/- 10.6 versus 42.0 +/- 10.8 liters/min) and ventilatory equivalent (29.4 +/- 4.8 versus 31.5 +/- 6.8) did not differ between digoxin and placebo treatment, although systolic blood pressure was higher during digoxin therapy (163.0 +/- 23.1 versus 153.2 +/- 25.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of treatment of recurrent ischemia after reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction on in-hospital mortality and left ventricular function recovery and to identify patients at highest risk of serious consequences in the event of recurrent ischemia in this setting, 405 consecutively treated patients were studied retrospectively. All patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy within 6 h of ST segment elevation-documented infarction and had angiographic confirmation of their reperfusion status performed within 120 min of treatment. Three hundred three patients had successful reperfusion with or without rescue angioplasty and had no recurrent ischemia (group 1), 74 patients had initially successful reperfusion but subsequent recurrent ischemia (group 2) and 28 patients had failed reperfusion (group 3). The in-hospital mortality in groups 1 to 3 was 2.0%, 14.9% and 32.1%, respectively (p less than 0.001) and the change from baseline to prehospital discharge left ventricular ejection fraction was 1.2 +/- 9.3%, -0.8 +/- 8.7% and -4.3 +/- 5.3%, respectively (p = NS). Within the recurrent ischemia group (group 2), multiple regression analysis found absence of cardiogenic shock at presentation (p = 0.002) and successful treatment initiated within 90 min of recurrent ischemia (p = 0.045) to be the only variables independently correlated with in-hospital survival. Later successful reperfusion was not associated with improved hospital survival. The timing and success of treatment did not affect recovery of global or regional left ventricular function in the patients with paired angiographic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the basis of a substantial body of research in oncology and wound healing, it is hypothesized that restenosis is a manifestation of the general wound healing response expressed specifically in vascular tissue. The temporal response to injury occurs in three characteristic phases: inflammation, granulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The specific expression of these phases in the coronary artery leads to intimal hyperplasia at 1 to 4 months. The major milestones in the temporal sequence of restenosis are platelet aggregation, inflammatory cell infiltration, release of growth factors, medial smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation, proteoglycan deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Each step has potential inhibitors that could be used for preventive therapy. Resolution of restenosis, however, probably requires both creation of the largest possible residual lumen and substantial inhibition of intimal hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Indications for coronary angioplasty have expanded to include patients with unstable acute ischemic syndromes, severe multivessel coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. Several mechanical approaches have been developed as adjuncts to high risk coronary angioplasty to improve patient tolerance of coronary balloon occlusion and maintain hemodynamic stability in the event of complications. These percutaneous techniques include intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, anterograde transcatheter coronary perfusion, coronary sinus retroperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, Hemopump left ventricular assistance and partial left heart bypass. The intraaortic balloon pump provides hemodynamic support and ameliorates ischemia by decreasing myocardial work; it may be inserted for periprocedural complications or before angioplasty in patients with ischemia or hypotension. Anterograde distal coronary artery perfusion may be accomplished passively through an autoperfusion catheter or by active pumping of oxygenated blood or fluorocarbons through the central lumen of an angioplasty catheter. Synchronized coronary sinus retroperfusion produces pulsatile blood flow via the cardiac veins to the coronary bed distal to a stenosis. Both perfusion techniques limit development of ischemic chest pain and myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflations. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass provides complete systemic hemodynamic support which is independent of intrinsic cardiac function or rhythm and has been employed prophylactically in very high risk patients before coronary angioplasty or emergently for abrupt closure. These and newer support devices, while associated with significant complications, may ultimately improve the safety of coronary angioplasty and allow its application to those who would otherwise not be candidates for revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between left ventricular diastolic abnormalities and myocardial blood flow during ischemia was studied in eight open chest dogs with critical stenoses of the proximal left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. The heart was paced at 1.7 times the heart rate at rest for 3 min. In dogs with coronary stenoses, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 8 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg during pacing tachycardia (p less than 0.01) and 16 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after pacing, with increased end-diastolic and end-systolic segment lengths in the ischemic regions. Left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations for ischemic regions shifted upward during and after pacing tachycardia in dogs with coronary stenoses, indicating decreased regional diastolic distensibility. In dogs without coronary stenoses, the left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relation was unaltered. Pacing tachycardia without coronary stenoses induced an increase in anterograde coronary blood flow (assessed by flow meter) in both the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, and a decrease in regional vascular resistance. In dogs with coronary stenoses, regional vascular resistance before pacing was decreased by 18%; myocardial blood flow (assessed by microspheres) was unchanged in both the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery territories. During pacing tachycardia with coronary stenoses, regional coronary vascular resistance did not decrease further; subendocardial myocardial blood flow distal to the left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis decreased (from 1.03 +/- 0.07 to 0.67 +/- 0.12 ml/min per g, p less than 0.01), as did subendocardial to subepicardial blood flow ratio (from 1.04 +/- 0.09 to 0.42 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ischemia was induced by gradual tightening of a micrometer-controlled snare around the left anterior descending coronary artery, which supplied the apical myocardium. Data were obtained at normal flow, after critical constriction (loss of pulsatile coronary flow), mild ischemia (ischemia 1: onset of regional dysfunction, i.e., postsystolic shortening and mild hypokinesia) and moderate ischemia (ischemia 2: marked hypokinesia). At each stage, acute afterloading was performed by partially occluding the descending thoracic aorta. The pressure-length loops were analyzed in terms of four areas: total loop area, effective shortening area, postsystolic shortening area and systolic lengthening area. Total loop area decreased only when marked hypokinesia was present (176 +/- 18.3 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 2 versus 245.1 +/- 26.9 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 1, p less than 0.05). However, effective shortening area (98.2 +/- 0.8% of total loop area at baseline; 93.8 +/- 2.4% at critical constriction; 76.3 +/- 7.2% at ischemia 1; 51.9 +/- 12.2% at ischemia 2) and postsystolic shortening area (1.8 +/- 0.8% of total loop area at baseline; 5.2 +/- 1.9% at critical constriction; 14.3 +/- 3/4% at ischemia 1; 23.8 +/- 5.1% at ischemia 2) changed significantly with each progressive stage of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser photocoagulation of the atrioventricular (AV) node to control the ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms without creating AV block. In 12 dogs on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, short laser pulses were delivered to an area between the coronary sinus orifice and the site of the most proximally recorded His deflection until second degree AV block occurred at a paced atrial rate of 200 beats/min. Long-term effects on AV node function were followed up for 3 months. Three animals developed chronic high grade AV block. In nine animals with preserved 1:1 conduction, the mean (+/- SEM) critical atrial cycle length resulting in AV node Wenckebach periodicity increased from 183 +/- 6 to 261 +/- 24 ms (+43%), the mean RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased from 248 +/- 14 to 330 +/- 27 ms (+32%) and the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation increased from 215 +/- 11 to 275 +/- 20 ms (+28%). Laser effects were not reversed by isoproterenol infusion. Histologic examination of the irradiated area showed fibrotic changes in the AV node and fatty metamorphosis. This study suggests that 1) graded Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation of the AV node region in dogs results in long-term modification of anterograde AV node transmission properties; 2) 1:1 conduction during sinus rhythm usually remains preserved, but ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is chronically reduced; and 3) progression to high grade AV block occurs in a minority of animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve of the affected dogs were studied as immature animals and followed at 1 to 6 month intervals until they were 7 to 46 months of age. Compared with control dogs, affected dogs had significantly increased (p less than 0.02) Q/R ratios in ECG leads II, III, aVF, CV6LL (V2) and CV6LU (V4). Carrier dogs had significantly increased (p less than 0.02) Q/R ratios in leads V2 and V4. The Q/R ratio increased in three of six dogs followed up from age 6 months to greater than 2 years. The PR intervals were significantly shorter (p less than 0.02) in affected dogs. Ventricular arrhythmias were identified in four of six mature affected dogs. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed distinctive hyperechoic lesions in 12 of the 13 affected dogs and in 6 of the 11 carrier dogs. Hyperechoic lesions corresponded to calcified myocardium and surrounding dense connective tissue. This study establishes the dog affected with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy as an animal model of Duchenne's cardiomyopathy and demonstrates that the heart in carrier dogs is affected by the dystrophic process.\r"

The present study was designed to evaluate whether these improvements are maintained when the dose of budesonide is reduced. At the end of the original study, 28 subjects with asthma, who had been in the active-treatment arm of the study were randomized either to continue taking the dose of budesonide taken in the original study or to have the dose reduced. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, bronchodilator requirements, symptoms, and spirometry were assessed after 6 weeks and 3 months. During the 3 months, no subject experienced an asthma exacerbation, and there was no evidence of change in airway responsiveness in subjects who had their steroids reduced (provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1; initial, 2.03 mg/ml; final, 1.91 mg/ml), and this change was not different from change in subjects maintained with a higher dose (initial, 3.02 mg/ml; final, 3.12 mg/ml) (p = 0.39).

However, after 3 months of reduced steroid use, there was a small decline in spirometry (FEV1 percent predicted: initial, 84.4%; final, 81.5%), and this change was significantly different from change in subjects in whom steroids were not reduced (initial, 90.2%; final, 90.2%) (p = 0.002). At 3 months, symptoms (predominantly sputum production) were also beginning to redevelop in the reduced budesonide group (p = 0.056).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A pulmonary macrophage-monocyte-derived mucus secretagogue (MMS) oligopeptide has been previously reported to induce mucus secretion in an in vitro model system with human airway explants and secretory epithelial cells. To understand the possible role of macrophages in the regulation of secretion of mucus, our laboratory has used a series of human macrophage hybridomas that were generated by fusing an hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient promonocytic line, U937, with macrophages obtaining by maturing monocytes in Teflon bags. The cell lines were proven to be true hybridomas by acquisition of donor class I antigens, additional chromosomes, as well as macrophage specific (maximum velocity) not present on the U937 parent line. One clone, clone 63, produced large amounts of an oligopeptide with an approximate molecular weight of 2000, which was identified from culture supernatants by ultrafiltration, chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and Western blot. Processed clone 63 supernatant had biologic activity causing increased secretion of radiolabeled glycoconjugate in both cultured airways and secretory epithelial cells. Immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal rabbit antisera generated against MMS was positive, and Western blot analysis produced a band at approximately 2000 daltons, consistent with the previously described MMS. MMS secretion could be stimulated by zymosan and lipopolysaccharide and inhibited by both cycloheximide and erythromycin. Dexamethasone had a different effect, appearing to stimulate MMS production intracellularly but inhibiting its release once it was synthesized. The availability of cloned hybridomas allows for study of the regulation of mucus secretagogue production as well as purification of molecular species and provides a valuable tool for the study of mucus secretion.\r"

Dust collected from the CR-infested homes of two patients with asthma from Charlottesville, Va., demonstrated wide variation in the levels of Bla g I, depending on the location of dust collection. Dust from kitchen floors and cabinets contained 50-fold more allergen (mean, 10,755 U/gm of dust) than dust from bedrooms and upholstered furniture (mean, 204 U/gm). One hundred forty-five dust samples were collected from the bedrooms and living rooms of 22 children with asthma and 16 control subjects without asthma living in Atlanta, Ga. Twenty-seven of the 38 homes (17/22 children with asthma; 10/16 control subjects) had detectable Bla g I (4 to 1340 U/gm of dust). Bla g II levels were assayed in 40 kitchen, bedroom, and living room samples from homes in Wilmington, Del. Highest levels of Bla g II were detected in kitchen-floor dust (300 U/gm of dust). Additionally, approximately 20% of homes with no visual evidence of CR infestation had significant levels of Bla g II in at least one dust sample (greater than 4 U/gm of dust). Our results demonstrate that CR may be an occult allergen in homes. The kitchen appears to be the primary site of CR-allergen accumulation, but significant CR-allergen levels can also be found at other sites in the home. The MAb-based assays can be used for quantitation of environmental exposure to CR allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A panel of murine IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was raised against German cockroach (CR) (Blattella germanica) extract and selectively screened to identify MAb directed against allergen(s) recognized by IgE antibodies. Sera from 28 CR-allergic patients were used as sources of IgE antibodies to detect allergens \"presented\" by the MAb. Four clones (10A6, 3G12, 8F4, and 1D4) produced MAb to allergen(s) that bound IgE antibodies. Quantitative radioimmunoassays were used to compare levels of the MAb-defined allergens in CR extracts. MAb 10A6 reacted with a cross-reacting allergen that was detected in 9/14 CR species, including Blattella, Periplaneta, Blatta, Leucophea, and Supella spp, at concentrations of 100 to 10,000 U/ml. In contrast, MAb 3G12, 8F4, and 1D4 were Blattella specific. The allergen defined by MAb 8F4 was purified by MAb affinity chromatography and size-exclusion by high-performance liquid chromatography. It is a 36 kd heat-sensitive protein, isoelectric point, 5.2 to 5.4. Allergen 10A6 was partially purified by isoelectric focusing and high-performance liquid chromatography. It is a heat-stable, acidic protein (isoelectric point 3.15). Based on comparison of their properties with properties of previously described CR allergens, the allergens defined by MAb 10A6 and 8F4 have been provisionally designated Blattella germanica allergen I (Bla g I) and Blattella germanica allergen II (Bla g II), respectively. Assays of six commercial CR skin test extracts demonstrated a 200-fold difference in Bla g I levels (4.7 to 1085 U/ml) and only two extracts that contained detectable Bla g II (248 and 324 U/ml). The results demonstrate that MAb can be used to identify and define CR allergens and that the strategy of the use of MAb as a first step in allergen analysis and purification can be very effective, especially for poorly characterized allergen extracts.\r"

However, the relationship of these mediators, measured early to the late asthmatic response (LAR), airway reactivity, and clinical asthma, is unknown. In the present study, we evaluated mediator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and 5 minutes after allergen challenge from three subject groups: atopic subjects without asthma (N = 7), atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR [-) LAR) (N = 6), and atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR [+) LAR) (N = 6). Subjects with asthma were differentiated into subjects with and without LARs based on at least a 15% decrease in FEV1 between 3 to 8 hours postallergen inhalation. The mediators, prostaglandin D2 thromboxane B2 leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine, were measured both before and after allergen instillation. Baseline prechallenge levels were similar, except in the case of LTC4. LTC4 was detectable at baseline significantly more frequently in the atopic subjects with asthma with and without LAR when these subjects were compared to the atopic subjects without asthma (nine of 12 detectable versus one of seven detectable). In all groups, significant increases in mediator levels were observed in the groups with asthma postallergen challenge, compared to the atopic subjects without asthma. Atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR had significantly higher levels of all four mediators after challenge than atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR and atopic subjects without asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean blood eosinophil count was 808 x 10(6)/L at the start of the treatment period. Serum ECP and EPX were significantly raised compared with that of the references, whereas the mean serum MPO level was normal. The mean PEF was significantly and negatively correlated to both blood eosinophil count and serum ECP and EPX, but the predominant correlation was that between blood eosinophil count and PEF. At the end of the treatment period, PEF had increased and the blood eosinophil count and serum ECP and EPX were reduced when these values were compared with the values at the start of the treatment period. There was a significant and negative correlation of mean PEF to serum ECP but not to the blood eosinophil count. In individual subjects, the decreases in the blood eosinophil counts and serum EPX were significantly correlated to the individual increases of mean PEF. In conclusion, the present investigation indicates that in patients with asthma and pronounced eosinophilia, the lung function of the patients was principally related to the number of circulating eosinophils, whereas, when their eosinophilia was reduced to moderate levels, the patient's lung function was closer related to the activity of the eosinophils.\r"

Inhaled BK (20 breaths, 0.1 to 5.0 mg.ml-1) caused dose-dependent increases in pulmonary resistance. Neither inhaled SP nor NKA (20 breaths, 0.1 to 1.0 mg.ml-1) produced significant bronchoconstriction in allergic sheep. However, the response to SP could be enhanced (p less than 0.05) by pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan (40 breaths, 1 mg.ml-1). Sheep that were allergic to Ascaris suum antigen were 5.9 times (p less than 0.05) more sensitive to the constrictor effects of BK than nonallergic sheep. BK-induced bronchoconstriction was blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the BK beta 2-receptor antagonist, NPC 567 (D-arginine[hydroxyproline3,D-phenylalanine7]BK). Atropine (0.2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) and nedocromil sodium (1 mg.kg-1 in 3 ml of saline, aerosolized) significantly inhibited the BK-induced bronchoconstriction by 97% and 43%, respectively. Chlorpheniramine (2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) had no effect. NKA caused a transient increase in airway responsiveness in allergic sheep, producing a mean 1.9-fold leftward shift in dose-response curves to aerosolized carbachol (p less than 0.05). This hyperresponsiveness was not evident 24 hours after NKA challenge. Neither SP nor BK changed airway responsiveness. Thus, in allergic sheep, inhaled BK caused a more pronounced bronchoconstriction than that observed in nonallergic sheep. The bronchoconstriction was blocked by a BK-receptor antagonist and appeared to be partially mediated via cholinergic reflexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that the amount of PAF-induced neutrophil migration was barrier dependent. At low PAF concentrations, neutrophil migration through filters exceeded migration measured through either cellular barrier. As PAF concentrations increased to greater than or equal to 1 mumol/L, neutrophil migration through human umbilical vein endothelial cells often equaled or exceeded migration measured through filters alone. In contrast, significant neutrophil migration through Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was not observed until PAF concentrations exceeded 50 mumol/L.

All extracts were tested before or after gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 columns (fraction 2) as previously described. Skin test studies of 69 subjects with asthma with extracts of American or German cockroaches demonstrated a significant correlation of reactivity to whole body and fecal extracts for both species. Direct RASTs of 13 sera from cockroach skin test-positive subjects were generally greater to both German whole body extracts (GWBEs) and German fecal extracts (GFEs) as compared to American whole body and fecal extracts. There was a good correlation of RAST reactivity to GWBE with GFE. RAST inhibition demonstrated that GFE contained most of the allergenic activity present in GWBE. These studies demonstrate the allergenic similarities of cockroach whole body and fecal extracts and suggest that cockroach feces are an important sensitizing agent in atopic asthma.\r"

Impactor collections were obtained at front and rear seat points and at the track center during periods with (1) windows and vents closed and air conditioning on, (2) windows closed, vents open, and no air conditioning, and (3) air conditioner off, front windows open, and vents closed. These conditions were examined sequentially during travel at 40, 50, 60, and 80 kph. Particle recoveries within the two, new, similar Chrysler Corporation passenger vehicles did not vary with the speed of travel, either overall or with regard to each of the three ventilatory modalities. In addition, collections at front and rear seat sampling points were comparable. Highest interior aeroallergen levels were recorded with WO, and yet, these levels averaged only half the concurrent outside concentrations at track center. Recoveries within the cars were well below recoveries obtained outside when windows were closed (both VO and AC modes). These findings suggest window ventilation as an overriding factor determining particle ingress into moving vehicles. Efforts to delineate additional determinants of exposure by direct sampling are feasible and would appear essential in formulating realistic strategies of avoidance.\r"

To monitor these changes, Evan's blue dye, iodinated rat albumin and IgG, and tritiated neutral dextran molecules having different molecular radii were used. After intradermal injections of serotonin, histamine, and bradykinin, the degree of radiolabeled tracer efflux was determined by measuring the extent of blueing and the level of radioactivity in skin biopsy specimens. Although the mediators varied in potency on a molar basis (serotonin greater than bradykinin greater than histamine), the efflux resulting from each was similar. Furthermore, kinetic studies revealed that each of these vasoactive agents caused a marked but transient increase in macromolecular permeability that lasted less than 30 minutes. To determine the pore size created and the effect of charge on the transudation of macromolecules into the interstitium, fractions of neutral [3H]dextrans with a known molecular size (average radii, 12 and 4.4 nm, respectively) were infused either singly or in combination with 125I-labeled rat albumin and/or IgG before intradermal injection of serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, or compound 48/80. Regardless of the mediator used, no differences could be demonstrated in macromolecular efflux, as indicated by either the molecular size of the charge of the tracer used. Thus, all mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions that were studied produce venular gaps greater than 12 nm in addition to displaying similar vasopermeable characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Alloantigen-specific, radiation-resistant T cells generated in mixed-lymphocyte cultures inhibited the generation of allospecific CTL responses in vitro. This regulatory T cell population was studied using mAb generated to Ag-specific suppressor factors that regulate the response to the synthetic terpolymer L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT). Both monoclonal 984 D4.6.5 and a pool of four mAb 2441, when added in the presence of complement, eliminated alloantigen-specific inhibition of the CTL response. When separate cell cultures treated with mAb 984 or 2441 plus complement were recombined, inhibition was reestablished, suggesting that two or more populations of cells are required for active inhibition. Furthermore, neither the mAb 984 nor the mAb 2441 plus complement had any effect on any stage of CTL development. This suggests that the inhibition of the CTL response was not the result of cytolytic activity via the regulatory T cells. Experiments in which these antibodies were added without complement treatment showed that the mAb 2441 neutralized the inhibitory activity, whereas mAb 984 augmented inhibition. It is concluded from these studies that regulatory T cells originally identified in humoral immune responses also regulate cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor epitopes are displayed on the surface of these cells that allow them to be distinguished from other T cells. These data also show the utility of the mAb 984 and 2441 raised against specific suppressor T cell products in different experimental models of immunity. These studies suggest that phenotypically distinct Ts cell populations can play a normal regulatory role in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.\r"

  ".W": "It has been established that murine mast cells are derived from a pluripotent bone marrow stem cell. In humans, the corresponding pluripotent cell is included in the CD34+ bone marrow population. To determine whether human mast cells arise from CD34+ human progenitor cells, enriched CD34+ cells were cultured over agarose surfaces (interphase cultures) or cocultured with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of recombinant human (rh) IL-3. The presence of both mast cells and basophils was determined using a variety of histochemical and immunohistologic techniques, including immunogold labeling for IgE receptors and mast cell tryptase. Mast cells and basophils continued to appear in cultures when T cell, B cell, macrophage, and eosinophil committed progenitor cells were removed, but were not seen in cultures from which CD34+ cells were removed. CD34+ cells layered over agarose in the presence of rhIL-3 were shown to give rise to cultures that contained mast cells (1 to 5%) and basophils (25 to 40%). Cultures supplemented with rhIL-4 showed no additional increase in mast cells or basophils. CD34+ cells cocultured with 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of rhIL-3 gave rise to mast cells within the fibroblast monolayer, which by 6 wk comprised up to 46% of the monolayer. CD34-cells on 3T3 fibroblasts gave rise to few mast cells (2% of the monolayer). Mast cell granules from interphase cultures contained homogeneous electron-dense material. In contrast, mast cells within 3T3 monolayers at 6 wk contained a variety of granule morphologies, including scroll, mixed, reticular, dense core, or homogeneous patterns. We conclude that both human mast cells and basophils arise from CD34+ human progenitor cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on the generation of NK cells were studied using syngeneic bone marrow transplanted mice subsequently treated with CsA (BMT/CsA mice). In contrast to a severe reduction in T cells that was reported previously, these mice exhibited a marked enhancement of splenic NK activity. The enhanced NK activity was mediated by NK1.1+, Thy-1- cells as assessed by antibody plus complement treatment, and was concomitant with an absolute increase in the numbers of NK1.1+ cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Because the depletion of host-derived, mature NK cells by injection of anti-asialo GM1 antibody before bone marrow reconstitution did not affect the enhancement of NK activity, CsA appeared to augment the generation of NK cells from bone marrow precursors. To investigate a possible relationship between the enhancement of NK activity and the maturational arrest of T cells in the thymus induced by CsA, mice were thymectomized, followed by irradiation, bone marrow reconstitution, and CsA treatment. These mice exhibited as strong enhancement of splenic NK activity as BMT/CsA mice, suggesting that the CsA-induced effect on NK cells is distinct from its effect on T cell development in the thymus. Taken together, these results are the first demonstration of the positive effect of CsA on NK cell generation and may be of importance in clinical bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to identify and isolate the pathophysiologically important B cell subpopulation which is activated to Ig secretion and autoantibody production in stimulatory (chronic) graft-vs-host (GVH) reactions. We recently demonstrated that IL-5 stimulation in vitro induces the appearance of a distinct CD44hi Ialow CD45Rlow B cell subpopulation that has aquired the ability to bind to hyaluronate (HA), one of the ligands for CD44, and that this B cell subpopulation is enriched in both proliferative and Ig-secretory responses. In the present report, CD44 expression was examined in B cells which were activated in the course of stimulatory GVH reactions. Compared with normal mice, B cells from mice undergoing stimulatory GVH reactions contained a novel CD44hi B cell subpopulation which exhibited enhanced binding to HA. The CD44hi HA-adherent B cell subpopulation from GVH mice spontaneously secreted large amounts of Ig, particularly IgG, including autoantibody specific for ssDNA. These findings demonstrate that CD44 expression distinguishes those B cells that are activated in vivo in the course of GVH to proliferate and differentiate into Ig-secreting cells. These CD44hi, HA-adherent, cells may play a prominent role in the hypergammaglobulinemia and immune complex glomerulonephritis that occur during chronic GVH reactions.\r"

  ".W": "A human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC)/monocyte (MC) coculture system was used to dissect cell:cell interactions associated with production of procoagulant activity (PCA) in response to two common stimuli of intravascular coagulation in vivo (LPS and immune complexes). We found that the presence of MC at a ratio of 1 MC:10 EC increased the sensitivity of EC to LPS by 4 logs and the maximal response approximately 20-fold. Aggregated IgG alone did not stimulate the system, but in the presence of small amounts of LPS (1 to 10 ng/ml) aggregated IgG was a powerful stimulus. More than 90% of the PCA was tissue factor as shown by clotting studies and mRNA analysis. PCA was not produced by either cell alone under the conditions of study, but was produced in large amounts when the EC and MC were cocultured. The supernatant from the coculture stimulated virgin EC, but not MC, to synthesize tissue factor. The major factor in the supernatant was IL-1 beta as shown by measuring IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha in supernatants and by blocking the production of PCA by preincubation of supernatants with anti-cytokine antibodies. Small amounts of TNF-alpha were present in the supernatant but anti-TNF-alpha did not inhibit PCA production. Studies using recombinant cytokines established that IL-1 beta was the most potent of the cytokines tested, that cytokines potentiated each other, and that the results could be explained in quantitative terms by the amounts of IL-1 beta measured. These data emphasize that cell:cell interactions are likely to modulate procoagulant events in vivo in the presence of both LPS and immune complexes, and that IL-1 beta may be an important cytokine in these events.\r"

  ".W": "During the course of B lymphocyte development, newly emerging surface Ig+ B cells pass through a stage when Ag-Ag receptor interactions lead not to immune responsiveness but to a state of functional tolerance. We have explored the molecular basis of antigenic nonresponsiveness and tolerance susceptibility using tolerance-susceptible surface Ig+ splenic B lymphocytes from neonatal mice and anti-mu chain antibodies as a polyclonal ligand. In this population of cells, surface IgM is uncoupled from the inositol phospholipid (PI)-hydrolysis pathway at a point proximal to the receptor; anti-mu antibodies did not stimulate inositol phosphate generation despite the fact that PI-hydrolysis was observed after treatment with A1F4, implicating the existence of a functional G protein and phospholipase C. Further evidence for a difference early in the signal transduction pathway stems from the finding that anti-mu stimulation does not induce the expression of two immediate/early PKC-linked genes egr-1 and c-fos. This appears to be the primary signaling difference between the mature and immature B cells from the neonatal mouse splenic population, as these cells undergo a G0-G1 cell cycle phase transition when surface IgM is bypassed using phorbol diester and calcium ionophore. Interestingly, despite undetectable levels of PI-hydrolysis, we observed equivalent receptor-mediated changes in intracellular calcium when comparing the immature and mature populations. These results indicate incomplete coupling of surface IgM to the signal transduction machinery operative in mature, immunocompetent B cells and suggests a molecular mechanism accounting for the differential processing of surface IgM signals into activation vs tolerogenic responses observed in these two stages of B cell development.\r"

T cells from subjects expressing each of the alleles from DR1 to DR7 responded to synthetic peptides of 17 or 21 amino acid residues. Furthermore, inhibition studies with mAb to HLA class I and class II Ag showed that the DR Ag was a restriction molecule for the proliferative responses. Mouse L cells transfected with DR1, DR2, DR4, DR5, and DR7 were used to confirm the permissive nature of the responses. An analysis of the fine specificity of the responses showed that the minimum peptides capable of stimulating T cells from subjects with different DR types varied by one or two residues. For DR2 and DR3 the shortest peptide was residues 6-15, an additional serine (residue 5) was required for DR1 and DR7 and an aspartic acid (residue 4) for DR4, DR5, and DR6. Successful oral-mucosal bacterial colonisation in humans, by a largely commensal Streptococcus, might be associated with the permissive nature of the HLA-DR restriction of the response to a major streptococcal cell surface peptide. The peptide recognised in association with the HLA-DR molecule may induce an immune response that prevents central entry of the organism from the peripheral mucosal site.\r"

  ".U": "91132009\r", 
  ".W": "A human CTL epitope located in a region of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp41 that is highly conserved among various HIV-1 strains was identified. This epitope was recognized by CD4+ CTL clones that were induced in seronegative humans by immunization with recombinant gp160. Fusion proteins carrying portions of the HIV-1 env gene and synthetic peptides were used to localize this epitope to amino acids 584-595 of the HIV-1 BRU env sequence. Only two positions within this epitope showed variation among North American HIV-1 isolates, and the substitutions were conservative in nature. The Lys to Arg substitution at position 593 abolished recognition, probably by interfering with the peptide-MHC interactions. This epitope was recognized in association with at least one subtype of the widely distributed human class II MHC specificity DPw4, namely DPw4.2. The relatively high frequency of this allele (27.2% among Caucasians) makes it likely that a larger fraction of the population would generate a response directed at this epitope than would be the case for epitopes recognized in the context of gene products of most other class II and class I loci. Interestingly, the closely related DP beta-chain allele types 4.1 and 2.1, which differ from 4.2 by 3 and 1 amino acids, respectively, were unable to present this gp41 peptide to DPw4.2-restricted clones. Comparison of the structure of this epitope with that of other peptides recognized in the context of DPw4.2 led to the identification of a consensus sequence for DPw4.2 binding peptides. Because the gp41 CTL epitope 584-595 identified here is highly conserved and is recognized in the context of a common DP allele, it may represent an important target region for vaccine development. Our results indicate that vaccines containing this epitope may induce in a significant fraction of those immunized CTL active against at least half of all HIV-1 strains.\r"

  ".W": "Members of the beta 1 subfamily of heterodimeric integrins, such as the fibronectin receptors alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 1, are expressed on human T lymphocytes. The presence of these two adhesion receptors on T lymphocytes suggests an involvement in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that may be important for the development of immune and inflammatory reactions. We have examined the cell surface expression of alpha 5, alpha 4, and beta 1 subunits on purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes before and after activation with Con A and PMA. Freshly isolated T lymphocytes contained distinct fractions expressing high or low levels of alpha 5 and beta 1. Only a high expressing T lymphocyte population was present after 72-h culture with Con A and PMA. Time course analysis indicated that the shift in alpha 5 and beta 1 expression occurred during the first 24 h after addition of activating agents and occurred in the absence of proliferation. In contrast to alpha 5 and beta 1, essentially all freshly isolated T lymphocytes expressed high levels of alpha 4. After 72-h culture with Con A and PMA, a wide distribution of alpha 4 expression was observed. Further experiments showed that after activation, a proportion of CD4-positive cells decreased their surface expression of alpha 4, but increased their surface expression of alpha 5 and beta 1. In contrast, most CD8-positive cells increased their surface expression of alpha 5, beta 1, and alpha 4 upon activation. An examination of mRNA levels in pan-T lymphocyte cultures after activation indicated that alpha 5 and alpha 4 mRNA expression decreased, whereas beta 1 mRNA expression was unchanged, in Con A/PMA-activated cells as compared to those cultured in medium alone. Our results indicate that T lymphocyte activating agents may differentially affect the expression of alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 1, thus providing a mechanism for the selective regulation of binding interactions that occur at sites of immune reactions.\r"

Most Ig produced by CD5+ B cells are polyreactive natural IgM antibodies encoded by unmutated copies of germline VH genes. However, in this study we present data demonstrating the monoreactive high affinity character of the anti-idiotypic antibody (mAb383) produced by EBV383. These data are in agreement with our previous observations, showing that the VH chain of mAb383 is encoded by an extensive somatically mutated VHV gene in a way that is consistent with an Ag-driven immune response. A possible role for this remarkable anti-idiotypic antibody in the maintenance of B cell memory is discussed.\r"

In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-1 alpha induces ODC mRNA and ODC enzyme activity in T cells. Unlike many IL-1 actions on T cells, this did not require a costimulus from the TCR, IL-1 alone being sufficient to induce ODC. The mechanism of IL-1 induction of ODC probably operates at several levels, including transcription, mRNA stability, and translation. Previous studies have shown that IL-1 prepares T cells for replication by increasing the production of c-jun, c-fos, c-myc, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and the response to growth factors. From the present study, ODC induction can be added to the list of IL-1-induced replicative machinery in T cells.\r"

This work was designed to better define the role of HIV in the first steps of normal human B cells activation. We show that the infectious virus or recombinant envelope proteins can render B cells responsive to the growth-promoting effect of several T cell-derived IL, IL-2, IL-4, and low m.w. (12-kDa) BCGF. HIV acts in the absence of monocytes and on different populations of B cells. The competence signal can be provided by recombinant gp160 envelope protein. CD4 molecule is not involved in the interaction of HIV with B cells. In addition, we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha has no promoting activity when B cells are preactivated by HIV and it can suppress the response of HIV-preactivated B cells to IL-2, IL-4, and 12-kDa BCGF. Thus, the HIV envelope can deliver an early signal to normal B cells and modulate B cell response to physiologic signals. The possible relevance of this phenomenon to the immune defect observed in HIV patients is discussed.\r"

Our studies were conducted with long term cultured, human T-LAK cells from peripheral blood, which are 95 to 99% CD3+. We found that proliferating 7 to 10-day human T-LAK cells express TNFR, by using a 125I-TNF binding assay. Additional treatment of these cells with the cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-4, or IL-6 rapidly up-regulated 55-kDa TNFR mRNA transcription and doubled TNFR membrane expression. Further studies revealed that these cytokines also increased the release of TNF and lymphotoxin (LT). Antibody neutralization studies indicated that IL-1 induces release of both TNF and LT; however, IL-4 and IL-6 induce primarily LT release. These results further support the concept that these cytokines are involved in the regulation of TNF/LT release, TNFR synthesis, and TNFR membrane expression. It is apparent that cytokines and their membrane receptors are involved in the autocrine/paracrine control of T cell proliferation, differentiation, and expression of functional activity after IL-2 stimulation in vitro.\r"

In this study, we have compared the mRNA levels for Fc epsilon RI alpha, three cytokines (IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and TNF-alpha), actin and three secretory granule-localized proteins (carboxypeptidase A, proteoglycan peptide core, and a generic serine protease) in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) before and after IgE-mediated activation and degranulation to determine the kinetics and specificity of mRNA induction. An antigen concentration of approximately 10 ng/ml was optimal for the release of histamine from IgE-sensitized BMMC and for the generation and release of a cytokine that was functionally and immunochemically identical to TNF-alpha. In kinetic experiments, the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF mRNA increased greater than 23-fold 0.5 to 1 h after activation. As assessed by in situ hybridization, virtually all BMMC contained detectable proteoglycan peptide core mRNA before and after exposure to Ag, but only approximately one-half of the Ag-treated cells in the culture contained IL-6 mRNA 1 h after activation. There was a slight transient increase at 4 h in the level of proteoglycan peptide core mRNA, but no increase in the levels of those highly expressed mRNA that encode actin, Fc epsilon RI alpha, carboxypeptidase A, and serine protease. Thus, despite the remarkable increment in the levels of the transcripts that encode cytokines in BMMC after IgE-mediated, Ag-dependent activation, the levels of those transcripts that encode a plasma membrane-localized recognition receptor and several constituents of the secretory granule remain essentially unchanged. The failure to increase substantially the level of protease and proteoglycan peptide core mRNA in mast cells after the activation/secretion response suggests that regranulation of mast cells is a slow process.\r"

We describe here the production of neutralizing and immunoprecipitating mAb and polyclonal antibodies specific for murine IL-1 beta and their application to a characterization of the murine IL-1 beta protein. Immunization of either hamsters or rabbits with the recombinant mature form of murine IL-1 beta emulsified in CFA elicited antisera and hamster mAb that only recognized denatured IL-1 beta. In contrast, immunization with rIL-1 beta adsorbed to alum resulted in the generation of neutralizing and immunoprecipitating rabbit and hamster antisera and hamster mAb. All of the mAb recognize both the pro-form of IL-1 beta and the mature bioactive form produced by cultures of murine peritoneal macrophages. Using these antibodies, we demonstrate that approximately half of the IL-1 activity present in supernatants of LPS-treated cultured mouse macrophages is composed of IL-1 beta. Additionally, IL-1 beta as well as IL-1 alpha can be detected in the plasma of LPS-treated mice. These studies, therefore, demonstrate the production of IL-1 beta both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

In this study, we investigated whether monocyte death results from membrane damage (i.e., necrosis) or internally regulated processes [i.e., programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis]. Our results clearly indicated that monocytes die by PCD when cultured without stimulation. Death was associated with fragmentation of DNA into integer multiples of approximately 200 bp, a decrease in cell size, condensation of the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles, and membrane blebbing, all of which are cardinal features of PCD. Monocytes exposed to nonphysiologic conditions such as acidic media (pH 4.2), 56 degrees C for 30 min, or freezing and thawing were killed without concomitant DNA fragmentation, indicating that DNA fragmentation was not a result of cell death per se. Addition of Escherichia coli LPS, a potent monocyte activating agent, in concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml caused a marked increase in monocyte survival and prevented DNA fragmentation. Moreover, exogenous human rTNF-alpha or IL-1 beta also prevented PCD, suggesting that PCD is regulated by certain cytokines released from LPS-stimulated monocytes. The results indicate that in the absence of appropriate stimulation, monocytes are programmed to undergo a sequence of molecular events leading to cell death. Regulation of PCD may be an important homeostatic mechanism for controlling the number of monocytes available to respond to infection, wound healing, and tumor growth.\r"

IL-7 or a control protein were administered to the mice twice daily and the cellularity and composition of the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, and thymus were determined at various time points thereafter. In comparison to the control cyclophosphamide-treated mice, animals receiving cyclophosphamide and IL-7 had an accelerated regeneration of splenic and lymph node cellularity. There was no significant difference in the rate of recovery of the bone marrow and thymus of the control and IL-7-treated mice. Assessment of the pre-B cell compartment revealed a dramatic increase in total pre-B cell numbers in the spleen and bone marrow of the IL-7-treated mice as measured by both flow microfluorimetry and a pre-B cell colony-forming assay. This was followed in a few days by a significant increase in surface IgM+B cell numbers to levels above normal values in both the spleen and lymph node. IL-7 administration to cyclophosphamide-treated mice also resulted in an accelerated recovery of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ cell numbers in the spleen and lymph node. The numbers of CD8+ cells were increased by twofold over normal levels in cyclophosphamide-treated mice receiving IL-7. Myeloid recovery was determined in cyclophosphamide treated mice by assessing the numbers of CFU-granulocyte-macrophage and Mac 1+ cells. There was no significant difference in myeloid recovery between cyclophosphamide-treated mice receiving IL-7 or control protein. These results suggest that administration of IL-7 after chemical-induced lymphopenia may have therapeutic benefits in shortening the period required to achieve normal lymphoid cellularity.\r"

High PY206 Id expression was linked to the IgHb Ig allotype locus. PY206 Id+ antibody-forming cells were identified in situ in cryostat sections of lymphoid tissues and idiotypic heterogeneity was identified among PY206+ B cells. Uninfected adult C57BL/6J mice had PY206 Id in their serum that lacked influenza binding specificity. In situ analysis of prenatal and neonatal spleen of uninfected C57BL/6J mice showed that the expansion of PY206 Id+ B cells occurred early in development. PY206+ cells were demonstrated in the lungs of influenza-infected mice but not in normal mice, establishing the capability to study this B cell population in the lung. This model offers the opportunity to manipulate the anti-influenza A virus hemagglutinin B cell response and to study the proliferation and migration of influenza-specific B cells in their native tissue environments.\r"

These results suggest that multiple epitopes corresponding to different HLA restrictions could coexist in a relatively small region of the NEF protein. The implications of these results in vaccine strategies using synthetic peptides bearing CTL epitopes are discussed.\r"

The addition of anti-IgG F(ab')2 to mouse eosinophils, previously sensitized with IgG, induces inositol phosphate generation after 2 min and after 10 min of stimulation. Maximal generation of inositol tris and inositol tetrakis phosphate has been detected after 15 min of stimulation, and the optimal concentration of anti-IgG F(ab')2 was found to be 25 micrograms. Inositol tris phosphate formation is also observed at 5 min after the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 microM). We also report that neomycin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-phospholipase C, inhibits Fc-gamma R-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown in a dose-dependent manner (88% inhibition at 150 microM of neomycin). The possible involvement of phosphoinositide breakdown in the activation of 5'-lipoxygenase has been investigated. Using streptolysin-O permeabilized cells and different doses of neomycin that inhibit phosphoinositide breakdown, we have demonstrated a parallel decrease in LTC4 released by these cells, using either A23187 (86% inhibition at 200 microM of neomycin) or anti-IgG F(ab')2 (82.4% inhibition at 100 microM of neomycin). [Ca2+]i elevation has been observed by loading the cells with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-2 penta-acetoxy methyl ester and after stimulating with the anti-Fc-gamma RII mAb (2.4G2). It is likely that the activation of murine eosinophils by a Fc-gamma R mechanism stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown as a primary step that leads to the activation of murine 5'-lipoxygenase, producing the formation of leukotriene C4.\r"

  ".W": "Two genes encode Fc gamma RIII (CD16), a low affinity FcR for IgG. CD16-I is expressed as a phosphatidylinositol glycan-anchored membrane glycoprotein on neutrophils, whereas CD16-II is a transmembrane-linked glycoprotein on NK cells. Membrane anchoring is determined by codon 203. Site-directed mutation of codon 203 and transient expression of these cDNA in COS-7 cells indicated that Phe, Ile, Leu, and Val permit transmembrane expression, whereas Ser, Thr, Tyr, Asn, Gly, Ala, Asp and Lys enable phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment. Thus, the involvement of amino acid 203 in membrane anchoring cannot be explained simply on the basis of size, charge, or polarity of the amino acid side groups at this site. Efficient expression of CD16-II in COS-7 cells requires co-transfection with either CD3 zeta or Fc epsilon RI-gamma. Truncation of the cytoplasmic segment of CD16 failed to affect association with CD3 zeta. CD3 zeta and Fc epsilon RI-gamma with truncated cytoplasmic segments were also able to facilitate membrane expression of CD16-II, implicating the transmembrane segments as the interaction site between CD16-II and CD3 zeta or Fc epsilon RI-gamma. Prior studies have suggested that the acidic residue in the CD3 zeta transmembrane segment may be important for the association of CD3 zeta complexes. Although site-directed mutation of CD3 zeta-Asp36 to Glu, Leu, or Val retained the ability to permit membrane expression of CD16-II, quantitatively the wild-type CD3 zeta-Asp36 provided optimal levels of expression, consistent with conservation of this amino acid in mouse and human CD3 zeta.\r"

Here we show that T cell receptor complex (CD3/Ti)-mediated inositol phosphate production was inhibited by CD45 ligation in Jurkat cells. CD3/Ti signaling in normal T cells was also inhibited by CD45 ligation, but coupling of CD4 with CD3/Ti gave augmented calcium signals that were entirely resistant to the inhibitory effect of CD45. In contrast, CD3-induced T cell proliferation was suppressed by immobilized CD45 mAb even in the presence of CD4 mAb. The effect of CD45 and CD4 ligation on tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation was directly examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Using immobilized mAb, CD45 ligation suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates induced by CD3/Ti stimulation, including almost complete suppression of 150-, 36-, and 35-kDa proteins and partial suppression of 76- and 80-kDa proteins. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by CD3/Ti stimulation, including 135- and 21-kDa proteins, were not suppressed by simultaneous ligation of CD3/Ti and CD45. Simultaneous ligation of CD3 and CD4 enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of all substrates, but did not overcome the CD45-mediated suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 35- and 36-kDa proteins. The CD45-mediated suppression of phospholipase C activation is therefore modulated by association with CD4 without altering the specific inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and T cell proliferation after co-ligation of CD45 and CD3/Ti.\r"

To identify the mb-1 gene product directly in B cells, affinity-purified MB-1-specific antibody was prepared by immunization of rabbits with synthetic MB-1 oligopeptide. Immunoprecipitation in combination with two-dimensional diagonal gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that this antibody detected a B cell-specific surface glycoprotein that is very similar to the IgM-alpha (B34) protein described by Hombach et al. However, MB-1 protein exists usually as the monomeric form on the surface of B cells, in contrast to IgM-alpha, which was detected as the dimeric (IgM-alpha/IgM-alpha or IgM-alpha/Ig-beta) protein. We also found that MB-1 protein is already expressed on the sIgM- pre-B cell lymphoma, which might suggest an alternative functional role of this B cell-specific MB-1 protein in B cell differentiation. The molecular identity of MB-1 protein and IgM-alpha (B34) is discussed.\r"

In this study, all were found to bind whole protein when tested against immobilized Ag in a standard solid-phase assay (ELISA), yet none of the antibodies recognized the Ag in its true native form, failing to bind when tested in several solution-phase assay systems, including size exclusion HPLC. This discrepancy may be the result of modifications of the epitope created by interaction and possible denaturation of the protein on the solid-phase matrix. As a consequence, binding of these antibodies to peptides, either immobilized or in solution, or to immobilized protein, cannot be used to infer that the peptide has assumed a conformation that corresponds to that of the cognate sequence in the native protein. A re-evaluation of binding data that relates antipeptide mAb to native structural characteristics may be necessary.\r"

The conserved PC-binding region of CRP corresponds to amino acids 51-66 within the human CRP sequence. A synthetic peptide composed of residues 47-63 of human CRP was previously shown to possess PC binding activity. The charged amino acids at positions 57, 58, 60, and 62 of this synthetic peptide were critical for PC-binding based on lower binding activity of synthetic peptides containing uncharged residues at these positions. The PC-binding peptide was used to generate mouse mAb that were tested for reactivity with intact CRP and with the TEPC-15 (T-15) mouse myeloma protein that also binds PC. The PC-binding peptide of CRP was recognized by two mAb specific for the T-15 Id. One of the mAb generated against the PC-binding peptide of CRP (IID6.2) recognized an epitope on the T-15 protein that was also recognized by the near-binding site-specific mAb (F6) to the T-15 PC-Id. Binding of IID6.2 to T-15 myeloma protein was not inhibited by PC and did not require Ca2+; however, binding was inhibited by the synthetic PC-binding peptide itself. Recognition of synthetic peptides containing uncharged amino acid substitutions by mAb F6 and IID6.2 was greatly reduced indicating that the shared epitope on T-15 and CRP was composed of similar charged residues. Therefore, CRP displays the same idiotope as an antibody that shares its specificity for the hapten, PC.\r"

Using in vitro quantitative monolayer adhesion and videomicroscopic transmigration assays, we have examined the contributions of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the leukocyte adhesion complex, CD11/CD18, to these processes. Maximal enhancement of PMN adhesion and transmigration were observed after 4 h of rIL-1 beta treatment, when surface expression of ELAM-1 had peaked and ICAM-1 was modestly increased. Blocking mAb directed to either ELAM-1 or ICAM-1 inhibited greater than 90% of the up-regulated PMN transmigration. Blocking mAb directed to either CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, a ICAM-1 counter-receptor), CD11b/CD18 (Mo-1), or CD18 (common beta 2-integrin) also blocked greater than 90% of PMN transmigration. At later time points (24 or 48 h), ELAM-1 surface expression was markedly decreased, whereas ICAM-1 expression was increased over the 4-h level; PMN adhesion remained elevated (approximately 50 to 60% of 4 h level), but transmigration returned to levels seen with unactivated HEC. These data indicate that PMN interaction with at least two distinct HEC adhesion molecules is necessary for transendothelial migration and suggests that PMN adhesion and transmigration, although interrelated, are mechanistically distinct processes.\r"

  ".W": "In the present communication, an experimental approach is utilized that facilitates the study of biochemical processes induced in B cells after their interaction with Th cells. In this approach, Th cell clones are stimulated for 18 h upon anti-CD3-coated plates, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and added at a 2 to 3:1 ratio to small, resting B cells (isolated from Percoll gradients). Th cells not stimulated on anti-CD3-coated plates, but fixed with paraformaldehyde, serve as controls for these experiments. The activated, fixed Th cells induce a transient, sixfold increase in B cell levels of cAMP, as well as an increase in B cell expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. This enzyme initiates the synthesis of polyamines and has been shown to be increased as cells enter the growth phase. In addition, previous studies have shown that the cellular levels of ODC activity are controlled by a multi-tiered regulatory cascade. To examine this aspect, polyclonally stimulated B cells were studied. Such cells demonstrated a gradual increase in ODC mRNA levels that peaked between 6 and 15 h and can be partially explained by a three- to fourfold increase in mRNA stability but not by changes in the enzyme affinity for substrate. The increase in ODC mRNA occurs in the absence of protein synthesis, suggesting that the ODC gene is a member of the immediate/early gene family. Finally, the early increase in ODC mRNA was enhanced in cells in which cAMP levels were artificially elevated, suggesting the possibility that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway participates during the regulation of this gene expression. The significance of these experimental results concerning the process of B cell activation is discussed.\r"

The protein has a m.w. of 45,000 to 50,000 and it will bind human IgG but not IgM, IgA, or IgE. The IgG-binding specificity of this protein (designated Fc gamma BP) is similar to that of the Fc gamma RII receptor in that it binds only to mouse IgG1 and IgG2b but not IgG2a. It is an intracellular protein and is detectable by immunoprecipitation from [35S]methionine-labeled cells but it is undetectable on the cell surface. Fc gamma BP is a phosphoprotein, and the amount of phosphorylated Fc gamma BP increases after treatment with alpha-IFN. Although the function of this protein has yet to be determined, the induction of an Fc-binding protein by alpha-IFN suggests a role in the immune response, particularly during infection by viruses.\r"

Measurement of Ag-specific lymphokine responses in these animals suggested that the difference in resistance mechanisms may be due to the differential induction of Th subset response by the two immunization protocols. Thus, upon Ag stimulation, singly immunized mice predominantly demonstrated responses associated with Th1 reactivity, including IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, whereas multiply immunized animals showed increased IL-5, IL-4, and IgG1 antibody production associated with enhanced Th2 response. These responses demonstrated some degree of organ compartmentalization, with splenocytes demonstrating higher Th1-related lymphokine production and cells from draining lymph nodes showing stronger proliferation and Th2 type reactivity. However, hyperimmunized mice also continued to demonstrate substantial Th1-associated immune reactivity. Moreover, in vivo Ag challenge elicited activated larvacidal macrophages in hyperimmunized animals. These observations indicate that protective cell-mediated mechanisms associated with induction of CD4+ Th1 cell reactivity predominate in singly vaccinated mice. Further vaccination stimulates Th2 responses, such as enhanced IgG1 production, that may also contribute to protective immunity.\r"

In previous studies performed in different murine MHC haplotypes, three immunodominant T cell epitopes (T1, T2, and TH4.1) had been identified in the HIV envelope glycoprotein. Moreover, these peptides were proliferative T cell epitopes in humans. In this study, rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, were primed with these three peptides either in combination or given separately. Half of the monkeys had a proliferative response to one or more of the priming peptide(s). Those monkeys who had a T cell proliferative response also had a high antibody response after one boost with a suboptimal dose of the native protein gp 160, whereas three of four control monkeys who had received only the native protein immunization gave no detectable antibody response, and one displayed a very weak response. For reasons that are unclear, antibodies only to the gp41 portion of gp 160 could be detected in the sera. Thus, the peptides can prime Th cells in primates for an enhanced antibody response on first exposure to the whole protein. The three peptides belong to highly conserved and nonglycosylated regions of the envelope protein. The fact that the peptides acted as immunogenic T cell proliferative and helper epitopes in nonhuman primates is very encouraging for including them in future vaccine studies in humans.\r"

Two independently obtained cell lines, established by culturing the PBL with either a recombinant P. vivax circumsporozoite (rPvCS) protein or a pool of synthetic peptides spanning the rPvCS sequence, recognized a 20-mer peptide from a nonpolymorphic region of the carboxyl terminus of the CS protein. This peptide overlaps a sequence homologous to region II of the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein. A third T cell line recognized an epitope within the central repeat domain, which has recently been found to be a polymorphic region of the P. vivax CS protein. The CD4+ clones derived from this third T cell line secreted IFN-gamma and IL-2 when stimulated with either the P. vivax repeat peptide (DRAAGQPAG)2 or the rPvCS protein.\r"

In the present work, the regulation of NF-kappa B expression was studied by analyzing subcellular fractions of adult murine splenic B cells with the electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a kappa B-containing oligonucleotide. Although nuclear extracts from resting B cells contained kappa B-binding activity, additional kappa B-binding activity was present in cytosolic fractions in a form that became apparent after treatment with detergent. Competition analysis indicated that the DNA binding activity detected by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay was specific for the kappa B motif, and UV photo-cross-linking showed the molecular size of kappa B-binding protein to be similar to that of the DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B. Nuclear expression of kappa B-binding activity was markedly induced by treatment of B cells with phorbol ester or with LPS. Most notably, kappa B-binding activity was induced after surface IgR cross-linking, and the mechanism of this induction involved PKC. Further, anti-Ig-induced activity was superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide. These results indicate that nuclear NF-kappa B is rapidly induced as a result of B cell stimulation, and further suggest that NF-kappa B may play a specific role in mature B cells after ligand binding to surface Ig distinct from its postulated developmental role as a stage-specific factor involved in kappa-enhancer function.\r"

  ".U": "91132043\r", 
  ".W": "Autologous melanoma-specific CTL recognize a common tumor-associated Ag (TAA) in the context of HLA class I antigens. We have demonstrated that HLA-A2 can be a restricting Ag and, in T cell lines homozygous for HLA-A2, that CTL can be generated by stimulation with HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas. In the current study, we have investigated T cell lines from patients who are heterozygous at HLA-A region locus, to determine the relative importance of each A-region allele in this MHC-restricted recognition of tumor. We have shown that HLA-A1 can be a restricting Ag, and that allogeneic melanomas expressing HLA-A1 can substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of HLA-A1-restricted CTL. However, when T cell lines express both HLA-A1 and HLA-A2, the HLA-A2 allele governed restriction of the melanoma TAA. Three autologous-stimulated HLA-A1, A2 CTL lines all demonstrated restriction by the HLA-A2 allele, when examined in cytotoxicity assays, cold-competition assays, and proliferation assays. There was no evidence of restriction by the second HLA-allele, HLA-A1. Although the autologous-stimulated CTL use a single A-region allele for tumor recognition, the autologous HLA-A1, A2 tumors are lysed by both HLA-A1-restricted and HLA-A2-restricted CTL. The dominance of restricting alleles was further demonstrated when HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas were used as the stimulating tumor to generate tumor-specific CTL. Stimulation of the heterozygous (HLA-A1, A2) lymphocytes with HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanomas resulted in CTL specific for the autologous tumor, and restricted by the HLA-A2 Ag. However, stimulation with an HLA-A1-matched allogeneic melanoma failed to induce tumor-specific CTL restricted by the HLA-A1 Ag. The data suggest there is a dominance of HLA-A region Ag at the level of the T cell, such that only one is restricting in the recognition of the autologous melanoma. At the level of the tumor, however, the TAA is expressed in the context of both HLA-A region alleles. We can generate specific CTL from lymph node cells or PBL and HLA-A region matched allogeneic melanomas; however, because most patients are heterozygous at the HLA-A region locus, an understanding of the dominant restricting alleles must be obtained so that an appropriately matched allogeneic melanoma can be selected.\r"

These CTL clones expressed preferential cytolytic activity against autologous tumor cells but not against allogeneic ovarian tumor cells and the NK-sensitive cell line K562. The cytolytic activity of these CTL against autologous tumors was inhibited by anti-TCR (WT31 mAb), anti-HLA class I, and anti-CD3 mAb but not by the NK function antibody Leu 11b. Cloning of the autologous tumor cells in vitro revealed that the CTL clones of the ovarian TIL expressed differential abilities to lyse autologous tumor cell clones. The specificity analysis of these autologous tumor specific CTL suggested that they recognize several antigenic determinants present on the ovarian tumor cells. Our results indicate the presence of at least three antigenic epitopes on the tumor cells (designated OVA-1A, OVA-1B, and OVA-1C), one of which (OVA-1C) is unstable. These determinants are present either simultaneously or separately, and six types of ovarian clones can be distinguished on the basis of their expression. These results indicate that CTL of the TIL detect intratumor antigenic heterogeneity. The novel heterogeneity identified within the ovarian tumor cells in this report may be of significance for understanding cellular immunity in ovarian cancer and developing adoptive specific immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer.\r"

The APC-containing fraction was first tested for its capacity to present exogenous modified-self or another tumor (Meth A) Ag after in vitro pulsing. The results showed comparable Ag-presenting capacities to those obtained by APC-containing fraction from normal spleen cells, indicating that APC function is not affected in tumor-bearing mice. We next examined whether APC from CSA1M-bearing mice bind endogenously generated CSA1M tumor Ag onto its surfaces to stimulate tumor-specific T cells. Five rounds of inoculation of APC-containing fraction from CSA1M-bearing mice without further in vitro pulsing resulted in the induction of potent anti-CSA1M immune resistance. The involvement of anti-CSA1M T cells in the induction of anti-CSA1M immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was delivered by Thy-1+ cell-depleted, but not by Thy-1+ cell-enriched fractions of spleen cells from CSA1M-bearing mice. Moreover, the failure of Sephadex G10-passed spleen cells to deliver anti-CSA1M resistance demonstrated the absolute requirement of APC for inducing the in vivo immunity. Finally, this in vivo resistance was found to be tumor specific, because APC fractions from CSA1M-bearing and Meth A-bearing BALB/c mice induced immune resistance selective against the corresponding tumor cell challenge. These results indicate that APC from tumor-bearing hosts can not only exert unaffected APC function against exogenous Ag, but also function to present tumor Ag generated endogenously in the tumor-bearing state and to produce tumor-specific immunity in vivo.\r"

We compared the time course of total hepatic mass, DNA and RNA accumulation, and thymidine kinase (TK) messenger RNA (mRNA) content and enzyme activity, after two-thirds partial hepatectomy in 6-week-old (young adult) and 1-year-old rats. Whereas 6-week-old rats had completely regenerated all liver mass, DNA, and RNA by 7 days, the regenerating 1-year-old rat livers at 7 days contained only 60% to 70% of the mass, DNA, and RNA in the normal 1-year-old rat liver. However, rates of tissue regeneration during this time were very similar in both ages. At 28 days the weight and RNA content of the 1-year-old rat livers were 93% of normal, but total DNA was still reduced, at 78% of normal. In the younger rats TK mRNA content and enzyme activity increased substantially after partial hepatectomy and were observed to peak at 24 hours. In the 1-year-old rats TK mRNA was less abundant in normal liver and the peak level observed was lower and delayed until 48 hours. Nonetheless, the incremental increase from baseline to peak was greater in the 1-year-old than in the 6-week-old rats. In contrast to the mRNA, TK activity peaked at 24 hours, but at substantially lower levels than in the 6-week-old rats. Rates of disappearance of TK mRNA and enzyme activity after peak levels were not significantly different by age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experiments were also done to determine whether higher doses (60 to 100 mg-1.100 gm-1) of these compounds had a delayed effect (48 hours) on GFR or ERPF. Massive urinary excretion of UHb occurred; however, only 1% of the alpha alpha XL and none of the beta beta XL was excreted. Plasma half time of alpha alpha XL and beta beta XL averaged 3.3 hours, or four times longer than UHb. In no case did a decrease in GFR or ERPF occur.

  ".W": "Heparin, hydrogenated dextran sulfate 8000 (Usherdex 8), and dextran sulfate 8000 were administered to rats, and the total drug was separated and determined in endothelium and plasma. A large amount of each drug was recovered from endothelium 2.4 and 6 minutes after intravenous injection. This accounted for the drug missing from plasma. The drugs in water were placed in the stomach by catheter. All three drugs were recovered from the endothelium and identified unchanged by electrophoresis and specific staining. The amounts that were recovered at 2.4 and 6 minutes were equivalent to most of the drug administered. Thus heparin, Usherdex 8, and dextran sulfate 8000 enter the body immediately on oral administration. At longer time intervals after intravenous and oral administration, much of each drug was not demonstrable in endothelium by the method used. Some drug could be detected in endothelium after 4 hours. After oral administration, plasma levels of each drug were rarely more than 0.5% of the dose. Formalin-alcohol was applied to the jugular veins of anesthetized rats to produce a thrombus, (see Blake et al. J Clin Path 1959;12:118-22) and the drugs were immediately introduced into the stomach. Four hours later the injured veins were inspected for thrombi. Incidence of thrombotic plug was 80% in rats that received saline solution, 4% with Usherdex 8, 0% with dextran sulfate 8000, and 0% with heparin. Usherdex 8, dextran sulfate 8000, and heparin demonstrate low, moderate, and high in vitro anticoagulant activity, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A loss of glutathione from the kidney can cause increased sensitivity to oxygen free radical-induced injury. In this study we investigated the effects of kidney preservation on glutathione and how various glutathione precursors affect glutathione concentration in the dog kidney. During 5-day continuous machine perfusion of the kidney at 5 degrees C, a loss of glutathione from the cortex tissue was seen (24% +/- 1% glutathione remained after 5 days). Perfusion with reduced glutathione (GSH, 3 mmol/L) suppressed this loss (77% +/- 11% of glutathione remained after 5 days). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) did not prevent the loss of glutathione. The addition of the three amino acids that make up glutathione (glycine, glutamic acid, and cysteine, 3 mmol/L each) also suppressed the loss of glutathione (82% +/- 13% remained at 5 days). The glutathione precursor, thioproline, a cysteine delivery compound, in combination with glycine and glutamic acid (3 mmol/L each), stimulated the synthesis of glutathione in the kidney during hypothermic perfusion (137% +/- 23% of control values at 5 days). The increase in tissue glutathione stimulated by GSH or other precursors was sensitive to the glutathione synthetase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine. This indicated the existence of active glutathione metabolism even at 5 degrees C in perfused kidneys. This study showed that in kidney preservation a loss of glutathione occurred that could be suppressed by the addition of various precursors for glutathione synthesis. The loss of glutathione from preserved kidneys may be one cause of posttransplant renal injury that could be prevented by use of the appropriate glutathione precursors.\r"

The present study evaluated the efficacy of diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitation fluid, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen tension as the study parameters. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed while they were anesthetized; they were then resuscitated with 14% hemoglobin solution. Animals that received either 10 mg/kg (n = 10) or 20 mg/kg (n = 10) of hemoglobin solution responded quickly and positively to the infusions: mean arterial pressure (which had dropped to less than 40% of prehemorrhage levels) returned to baseline within 2 minutes of initiating infusion; by 4 minutes, the mean arterial pressures of the hemoglobin-infused groups were significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) than those in both the autologous shed blood (n = 8) and lactated Ringer's (n = 10) groups. The heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses in both the half-volume and full-volume replacement hemoglobin groups matched the response to autologous shed blood throughout the hour of observation. The favorable hemodynamic response to infusion of cross-linked hemoglobin solution after hemorrhage suggests that this material is comparable to autologous shed blood and superior to lactated Ringer's solution as a resuscitative fluid as assessed in this model.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in a group of 32 normal volunteers (control group) and 12 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A mild but significant reduction in plasma level and an abnormal urinary excretion of alpha 2-antiplasmin was found in the nephrotic group. Plasma concentrations of factor XIII, fibronectin, and fibrinogen were significantly elevated in patients with nephrosis. In contrast, patients with ESRD showed no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of either factor XIII, fibronectin, or alpha 2-antiplasmin and only a modest elevation of fibrinogen when compared with normal controls. No significant correlation was found between serum creatinine concentration and plasma levels of factor XIII and its circulating substrates in the nephrotic group. No measurable quantities of factor XIII and only small quantities of fibronectin were found in the urine of patients with nephrosis. Elevation of plasma factor XIII, fibronectin, and fibrinogen concentrations in the nephrotic group is considered to be the result of a combination of increased synthesis and possibly contracted intravascular distribution of these macromolecular proteins in the face of their negligible urinary losses. The presence of the observed abnormalities in the nephrotic group and their absence in the non-nephrotic ESRD group tends to exclude renal failure as a cause of these abnormalities. Although the clinical significance of these abnormalities is uncertain, they can potentially contribute to the thrombophilic diathesis and platelet hyperaggregability in nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Under some conditions a further prolongation is required. In this study polymerization of the purified modified hemoglobin (HbNFPLP) with glutaraldehyde was investigated. The influence of the degree of polymerization on the iso-oncotic concentration and the viscosity of the polymerized Hb-NFPLP (polyHbNFPLP) was investigated with three products polymerized to an increasing extent. Exchange transfusions in rats followed by gel filtration analyses of plasma samples provided information on the vascular retention time of four separate polymer fractions (i.e., monomers, dimers, trimers/tetramers, and polymers). The vascular retention time of these fractions correlated with their size. For lightly and highly polymerized HbNFPLP we found fivefold and sevenfold increases, respectively, compared to the retention time for native hemoglobin. This finding and the different shapes of the clearance curves suggested a different clearance mechanism from the vascular system for the monomer and polymer fractions. By polymerizing HbNFPLP the oxygen affinity was enhanced (oxygen half-saturation pressure shifted from 45 to 22 mm Hg), and it appeared to be independent of the degree of polymerization. Because hemoglobin was undetectable in the urine of the rats after the exchange transfusions, no accumulation of polyHbNFPLP will occur in the tubules of the kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No association has been found between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) frequencies and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection, whereas significant associations have been reported in some populations between some HLA haplotypes and the appearance of either opportunistic infections or secondary cancers. With regard to the human leukocyte class I antigens, their role as restriction elements in presenting HIV 1 to virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes seems to be established. An increase in the serum levels of their soluble forms that correlate with disease stage has also been demonstrated. These circulating molecules could interfere with the immune response to HIV 1 and could contribute to the development of the immunodeficiency. Antigenic similarities have been detected between human leukocyte class II antigens and HIV 1 envelope proteins. These homologies could explain both the presence in some HIV-positive sera of anti-HLA class II antibodies that mediate the lysis of CD4(+)-HLA class II+ T cells and the false-positive reaction of some HIV-negative sera, which contain anti-HLA class II antibodies, in tests for HIV 1 antibodies. Reduced levels of some complement factors (the human leukocyte class III antigens) have been detected in HIV-infected subjects. These defects could play a role in the progression of the disease and affect both the clearance of HIV 1 and complement-mediated antibody responses. The data reported in this review suggest that HLA antigens may be involved in several steps of the immune deficiency of HIV-infected subjects and thus contribute to the pathophysiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

In all 16 cases with multiple lesions at least one of the lesions was asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis. It is concluded that multiple spinal epidural metastases are of common occurrence and occur in about one third of the cases. This finding may have important clinical implications. Examination of the spinal canal for epidural metastases should not be confined to the clinically suspected site, but should include as extensive an area as possible of the spinal canal, whatever technique is to be used.\r"

The commonest side effects were drowsiness and behavioural change. The remaining 100 patients were followed for a mean of 30 weeks (range 12-75). Forty one of these patients showed a marked improvement in seizure frequency (a 50% or more reduction when compared with the pre-trial period), and nine (7%) were rendered seizure free. Apparent tolerance to the effects of the drug were noted in five patients. An exacerbation of seizures may occur if the drug is withdrawn too quickly.

Thirty eight had necropsy examination with histological investigation of the spinal cord. No form of mechanoreception was removed in any of the 65 patients and in the majority no forms of tactile sensibility were altered by division of the pathways in the anterolateral and anterior columns. In no case was graphaesthesia affected. Knowledge of joint position and movement and awareness of vibration was normal in 62 of the 65 patients. But information carried by these anterolateral pathways does reach neural levels of consciousness, for with total lesions of the posterior columns, previously reported, touch and pressure are still felt. Itch was removed by division of the anterolateral pathways. Although the posterior columns are essential for discrimination in mechanoreception, discrimination may be disturbed by lesions of the anterolateral pathways, notably two-point discrimination. The evidence on the pathways essential for conveying impulses giving rise to tickle was inconclusive.\r"

In group 1, anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies were detected in eight patients (38%), in titres from 1:1000 to 1:32,000. A small cell lung cancer was present in six patients, ovarian cancer in one patient and in one patient no tumour could be detected. The neurological symptoms preceded a diagnosis of cancer in five out of eight patients. Anti-neuronal antibodies were found in the serum of two out of 94 patients (2%) from control group 3 but not in serum from any of the other control groups. These data indicate a moderate sensitivity of 38%, but a high specificity of 98.6% (95% confidence interval 95.5-99.8%) for the presence of anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies if a paraneoplastic NS disorder is suspected.\r"

A simple mathematical equation has been developed which combines the image and flow data to provide a single predictor of the degree of angiographic stenosis which has advantages over either ultrasonic modality used alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model in the detection of stenosis greater than or equal to 25% was 73% and 98%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 50% was 90% and 93%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, 65% and 99% and occlusion 100% and 94% respectively. The principal clinical value of ultrasound screening is to spare patients with \"non-significant\" stenosis the risk of unnecessary angiography. Thus a simple measure of the Duplex screening tests' performance is the proportion of all strokes occurring as a complication of angiography that are avoided by changing the investigation policy from \"angiograms for all carotid TIA and minor ischaemic stroke patients\" to \"angiograms for all patients with abnormal ultrasound results\". If Duplex scanning were used to select patients most likely to have a significant abnormality on angiography, depending on the degree of stenosis to be detected, 52-85% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. If the predictive equation were used 62-88% of angiographic strokes might be avoided.\r"

The problem is to determine whether the presence of several peaks represents the coexistence of separate tremor mechanisms or be a consequence of fluctuations in the frequency or amplitude of a single tremor. The spectrum of a tremor whose frequency or amplitude vary and are independent has the recognisable pattern of a central carrier frequency with sidebands of equal amplitudes distributed symmetrically around the carrier. However, if tremor amplitude and frequency fluctuate and are not independent, (frequency proportional to amplitude or frequency inversely proportional to amplitude), the spectrum has a pattern of sidebands which are asymmetrical in amplitudes and may resemble the spectrum of the combined signal from different independent oscillators. The investigation of sidebands in spectra has been neglected in tremor studies and multiple irregular peaks on a tremor spectrum have sometimes been used wrongly as evidence for the coexistence of multiple tremor mechanisms or frequency components assumed to be concurrent.\r"

Forty male patients with chronic stable suprasacral cord lesions were studied by filling and voiding videocystometrography, and recording lumbosacral evoked potentials from posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Only five of 15 patients with decreased detrusor contractility had abnormal lumbosacral evoked potentials. Similar abnormalities were found in four of 11 patients with efficient hyperreflexic bladders. The finding of normal lumbosacral evoked potentials in the majority of patients with suprasacral cord injuries and decreased detrusor contractility supports the argument that the pathophysiology of this specific form of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is multifactorial.\r"

Nine patients were studied; all had hydromyelia with varying degrees of associated hydrocephalus. Clinically applicable classification systems were used to evaluate the progression of hydrocephalus (Stages I to IV) and to define the compartment isolated after shunting in the previously communicating cerebral ventricles (Types I to IV). Four patients had Stage IV disease (holoneural canal dilatation); one had Stage II and four had Stage I disease (both Stages I and II with supratentorial hydrocephalus). All patients were initially treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunting at an average age of 9.9 years. Five patients had progressive spinal symptoms before or after treatment of their hydrocephalus. Two patients had Type III isolation (an isolated rhombencephalic ventricle) with a functioning ventricular shunt; ventriculography confirmed a communication between the fourth ventricle and the hydromyelia, and both patients improved after placement of a shunt in the fourth ventricle. The remaining patients had Type IV isolation (isolated central canal dilatation) with a functioning ventricular shunt. This study indicates that in some cases the pathophysiology of hydromyelia is closely related to associated hydrocephalus. A new concept of the development of an isolated compartment after shunting is proposed to explain the progression of hydromyelia in these cases.\r"

Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments. Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted. An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that selective posterior rhizotomy reduced spasticity, thereby increasing range of motion and contributing to improvements in active functional mobility.\r"

The highest values of thromboxane release were seen in patients who deteriorated due to delayed cerebral ischemia with a permanent neurological deficit. Thromboxane release was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) before the onset of severe delayed ischemia in six patients with preoperative ischemia compared to the patients without delayed ischemia. In five others, both ischemic deterioration and elevated thromboxane release occurred after operation. These patients had preoperative values similar to the values in those without ischemic symptoms. The observations suggest that increased platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are associated with delayed cerebral ischemia both before and after surgery.\r"

To clarify the biological and clinical behavior of these rare tumors, the authors retrospectively identified 59 patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma whose tumors were diagnosed and treated between June, 1976, and July, 1989. Three patients who were lost to follow-up review were excluded, as were two whose original slides could not be obtained and three whose tumors were diagnosed at recurrence or at autopsy. The pathological material of the remaining 51 patients was reviewed using two sets of histological criteria. Thirteen patients (Group A) had \"pure\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with more than 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of fibrillary astrocytes. Fifteen patients (Group B) had \"mixed\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with 20% to 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of anaplastic astrocytes. Twenty-three tumors did not meet these criteria and were excluded from analysis. The median age of the patients was 48.5 years in Group A and 38.3 years in Group B (p less than 0.05). In both groups, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale score was greater than 90%. All patients underwent surgical procedures (four total and 19 partial resections, and five biopsies) and postoperative radiation therapy. The majority also had interstitial brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or both. Ten patients had one reoperation for tumor recurrence and one had two reoperations; other treatments for recurrence included brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and repeat irradiation. All four patients who originally underwent gross total resection are still alive; all five who had a biopsy have died. There was no significant difference in median survival times between groups: 136.5 weeks in Group A (range 10 to 310+ weeks) and 135.6 weeks in Group B (range 31 to 460+ weeks). Analysis of all 28 patients showed a better prognosis for patients less than 50 years of age (185 vs. 36 weeks survival time; p less than 0.001), patients with preoperative symptoms lasting for more than 6 months (228.1 vs. 110.2 weeks survival time; p less than 0.05), and patients with seizures as the first symptom (185.7 vs. 80 weeks survival time; p less than 0.01). Survival time did not correlate with the presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. The authors conclude that the presence of at least 20% gemistocytes in a glial neoplasm is a poor prognostic sign, irrespective of the pathological background. It is proposed that gemistocytic astrocytomas be classified with anaplastic astrocytomas and treated accordingly.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical activity was recorded from single cells in the thalamus of 10 patients with chronic pain associated with deafferentation. Under local anesthesia, these patients underwent either electrode implantation or thalamotomy for treatment of their pain. In eight of the 10 patients, single units were identified as discharging spontaneously in high-frequency, often rhythmic, bursts. The discharges were of two types: short bursts comprised of two to six spikes with a burst frequency of one to four per second; and long trains of 30 to 80 spikes of similar frequency. Reconstruction of electrode trajectories indicated that recordings were made from the region corresponding to the lateral aspect of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the central lateral nucleus, a small part of the central median nucleus, and the parafascicular nucleus. In the eight patients in whom spontaneous neuronal burst activity was exhibited, it was impossible to study activity evoked by natural cutaneous stimulation due to the continuous spontaneous neuronal discharges. Both animal and human studies have suggested that pain related to deafferentation is accompanied by spontaneous hyperactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the ventral posterior thalamic nuclei. The authors present evidence of spontaneous neuronal hyperactivity in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei of patients with pain related to deafferentation. The findings suggest that spontaneous neuronal discharge in patients with pain related to deafferentation is more widespread in the central nervous system than has been previously appreciated. The results have important implications for the surgical treatment of chronic pain.\r"

  ".W": "Historically, the neurosurgical treatment of large acoustic neurinomas has developed with two principal goals: complete tumor removal and preservation of facial nerve function. A recent goal for small tumors is the preservation of hearing. Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter). Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case). Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review. Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences. Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery. The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years). Facial function was preserved in nine patients (82%). The results suggest that radical intracapsular removal may be the procedure of choice under certain circumstances and may offer an alternative to focused high-energy radiation.\r"

The authors describe six patients with this disorder who experienced loss of vision 6 to 36 months after neurological surgery and radiation therapy. Of the six patients in the series, two had a pituitary adenoma and one each had a metastatic melanoma, multiple myeloma, craniopharyngioma, and lymphoepithelioma. Visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to no light perception. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed sellar and parasellar recurrence of both pituitary adenomas, but the intrinsic lesions of the optic nerves and optic chiasm induced by radiation were enhanced after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) administration and were clearly distinguishable from the suprasellar compression of tumor. Repeated MR imaging showed spontaneous resolution of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the optic nerve in a patient who was initially suspected of harboring recurrence of a metastatic malignant melanoma as the cause of visual loss. The authors found the presumptive diagnosis of radiation-induced optic neuropathy facilitated by MR imaging with gadolinium-DTPA. This neuro-imaging procedure may help avert exploratory surgery in some patients with recurrent neoplasm in whom the etiology of visual loss is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1975 and 1989, 108 children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) of the posterior fossa were treated at the authors' institution. The patients were managed uniformly, and treatment included aggressive surgical resections, postoperative staging evaluations for extent of disease, and craniospinal radiation therapy with a local boost. Beginning in 1983, children with MB/PNET were prospectively assigned to risk groups; those with \"standard-risk\" MB/PNET were treated with radiation therapy alone, while those in the \"poor-risk\" group received similar radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), vincristine, and cisplatin. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rate for all patients treated between 1975 and 1982 was 68%, and 73% when patients who died within 2 weeks after operation were excluded. This survival rate was statistically better for patients treated after 1982 (82%) compared to those treated between 1975 and 1982 (49%) (p less than 0.004). There was no difference in disease-free survival rates over time for children with standard-risk factors; however, there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate for poor-risk patients treated prior to 1982 (35%) compared to those treated later (87%) (p less than 0.001). For the group as a whole, a younger age at diagnosis correlated with a poorer survival rate; however, this relationship between age and outcome was significant only for children treated before 1983 (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrated an encouraging survival rate for children with MB/PNET, especially those treated with aggressive surgical resection followed by both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The results strongly suggest that chemotherapy has a role for some, and possibly all, children with MB/PNET.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I-II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself. The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma.\r"

The authors obtained localized phosphorus MR spectra from 10 normal brains, four low-grade astrocytomas, six glioblastomas, four meningiomas, and three pituitary adenomas and found differences in the spectra of each tumor type. Compared to normal brain, the spectra from low-grade astrocytomas showed a significant reduction of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak. Glioblastomas were characterized by a significant reduction of the PDE peak, elevation of the phosphomonoester (PME) peak, and a relatively alkaline intracellular pH. The spectra from meningiomas and pituitary adenomas were markedly different from the glial tumors. Meningiomas showed significant reductions in phosphocreatine, PDE, and inorganic phosphate, as well as a relatively alkaline pH. Pituitary adenomas resembled meningiomas, but had a much higher PME peak. Although the number of tumors studied was small, there appears to be a characteristic spectrum associated with these different tumor types. The present findings can be useful in the preoperative identification of these tumors and in furthering understanding of their growth and metabolism in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of U-74006F on malondialdehyde (a by-product of lipid peroxidation) in subarachnoid clot. Eighteen cynomolgus monkeys were divided into three groups of six each. There were two U-74006F-treated groups, receiving doses of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg, and a placebo-treated group. Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and placement of subarachnoid clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days. Seven days after the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. In the placebo-treated group, significant vasospasm occurred in the MCA on the side of the clot (p less than 0.01). After U-74006F treatment at both dosages, significantly less vasospasm developed in the clot-side MCA (p less than 0.01). The content of malondialdehyde was measured by both the thiobarbituric acid test and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Comparing the two methods, HPLC proved to be more accurate than the thiobarbituric acid test, especially for measurement of low concentrations of malondialdehyde. In the placebo-treated group, the malondialdehyde content was significantly increased in the Day 7 clot (p less than 0.05). In contrast, malondialdehyde content in freshly prepared clot was very low. In the 0.3-mg/kg U-74006F group, the malondialdehyde content of clot was significantly less at Day 7 compared to clot from the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.05). Although the malondialdehyde content of clot from the 1.0 mg/kg U-74006F-treated group was less than that of placebo, it was not significantly so. Malondialdehyde was not detected in the actual vessel wall of the MCA of any group. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm and that the salutary effects of U-74006F in vasospasm may be mediated by a reduction of lipid peroxidation in SAH.\r"

The authors have applied and explored a new approach for bone repair which appears promising, even for use in less osteogenic environments such as the adult calvaria. Seventy-two adult Sprague-Dawley rats each received bilateral 8-mm trephine defects in the temporoparietal area; this defect size precludes spontaneous osseous healing during the lifetime of the animal. Five surgical procedures, employing various alternatives of biologically inert expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane positioning and intramembranous bone-chip implantation, were performed and compared to control defects. Slight improvement of bone regeneration was demonstrated with subperiosteal ectocranial and endocranial membranes, alone or in combination, and with bone chips alone or in combination with an outer or inner membrane. Virtually complete bone healing was observed in animals receiving both an outer and an inner membrane with interpositioned bone chips. The latter appeared to function primarily as space-holders by keeping the membranes separated throughout the defect. Consequently, this technique seems to significantly promote bone repair by excluding soft-tissue components from the bone-healing site.\r"

In the present study, the authors examined the effect of fluid-percussion injury on brain temperature in anesthetized rats and the effect of anesthesia on brain temperature in uninjured rats. The relationship between the brain, rectal, and temporalis muscle temperatures during normothermia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia was studied following a moderate magnitude of fluid-percussion brain injury (2.10 to 2.25 atmospheres) in rats. The results showed that mean brain temperature in 10 anesthetized injured rats, in 21 anesthetized uninjured rats, and in 10 unanesthetized uninjured rats was a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 36.04 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C, 36.30 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees C, and 37.95 degrees +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively. There was no significant difference in temperature under general anesthesia between injured and uninjured rats (p greater than 0.05). In the absence of brain injury, mean brain temperature was significantly lower in anesthetized rats than in unanesthetized rats (p less than 0.001). In anesthetized brain-injured rats, temporalis muscle temperature correlated well with brain temperature over a 30 degrees to 40 degrees C range, even when brain temperature was rapidly changed during induction of hypothermia or hyperthermia (r = 0.9986, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, rectal temperature varied inconsistently from brain temperature. These observations indicated that: 1) brain injury itself does not influence brain temperature in this model; 2) anesthesia alone decreases brain temperature to levels producing cerebral protection in this model; and 3) external monitoring of temporalis muscle temperature can provide a reliable indirect measure of brain temperature in the course of experimental brain injury. The authors believe that it is essential to monitor or control brain temperature in studies of experimental brain injury.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and immunogenicity of Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Hib-TT) were evaluated in 77 healthy infants receiving injections at 3, 5, 7, and 18 months of age. No serious local or systemic reactions were noted. After the first injection the geometric mean Hib antibody level rose to 0.55 micrograms/ml, and each subsequent injection elicited a statistically significant rise in the geometric mean. The percentage of vaccinees with Hib antibody levels greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml serum was 75.5% after the first, 97.4% after the second, and 100% after the third Hib-TT injection. This percentage fell to 90.9% at 18 months of age but rose again to 100% after the fourth injection. Control infants (n = 10) injected with diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccine only had nondetectable levels after the second injection. Hib-TT elicited increases of Hib antibody in all isotypes: IgG greater than IgM greater than IgA. Among IgG subclasses the highest increases were of IgG1. All vaccinated subjects had greater than 0.01 U/ml of TT antibody (estimated protective level) throughout the study. We conclude that Hib-TT, injected at 3, 5, 7, and 18 months, is safe and induces protective levels of antibodies during the age of highest incidence of meningitis caused by Hib.\r"

None of those with poor outcomes achieved normal protein/creatinine ratios during follow-up to a maximum of 5 1/2 years, but 93% of those who made a full clinical recovery no longer had proteinuria. Measurement of the protein/creatinine ratio in an early-morning sample of urine is a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive means of monitoring the progress of patients with diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, provided that a technique sensitive at low protein concentrations is employed.\r"

Eight (13%) had both proteinuria and reduced creatinine clearance; three (5%) had a combination of hypertension, proteinuria, and low creatinine clearance. Abnormalities sometimes appeared after an interval of apparent recovery. Logistic regression analysis showed that duration of anuria was the best predictor of disease at follow-up. No patients who had anuria lasting longer than 8 days or oliguria exceeding 15 days escaped chronic disease. However, 45% of those with disease had no anuria, and a third had no oliguria. Physicians should therefore be cautious in assuming recovery from HUS on the basis of a single evaluation and should periodically evaluate patients for an extended period.\r"

The group as a whole had normal height and weight percentiles, and each child grew along his or her established somatic growth curve. Although some children had abnormal values, the group maintained a normal mean total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. The mean residual volume and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratios were elevated at both ages. At age 7 years the 19 patients (59%) who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80% had \"catch up\" improvement by 10 years of age (65 +/- 11% to 72 +/- 16% of predicted value; p less than 0.05). All the children who had a normal FEV1 at 7 years of age continued to have a normal FEV1 at age 10 years. Resting single-breath carbon monoxide uptake by the lung was normal when measured at age 10 years. The majority of patients had a positive methacholine challenge test result at both ages, although there was a low incidence of clinically diagnosed asthma. This study demonstrates that patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who have normal lung function at age 7 have had normal lung growth and that those with evidence of mild to moderate lung disease have continued lung growth or repair, or both, during their school years.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between parental smoking and lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) was studied in a large cohort of infants followed prospectively from birth. Illnesses were diagnosed by physicians using agreed-on criteria, and parental smoking histories were obtained by questionnaire. The LRIs were differentiated into wheezing and nonwheezing episodes, and the age at first illness of either type was evaluated in relation to smoking by parents. The odds of having an LRI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked (odds ratio 1.52; confidence interval 1.07 to 2.15). The odds were higher if the mother smoked a pack of cigarettes or more per day and if the child stayed home rather than attending day care (odds ratio 2.8; confidence interval 1.43 to 5.5). Logistic regression indicated that the LRI rate was significantly elevated both in children exposed to heavy maternal smoke in the absence of day care, and in those who use day care but were not exposed to maternal smoking of a pack or more per day. These findings could not be attributed to other confounding variables. Neither paternal smoking nor smoking by other household members was consistently related to the LRI rate. The relationship of maternal smoking to LRI rate was evident for both wheezing and nonwheezing illnesses. Maternal smoking of a pack or more per day was also related to an early age at first LRI, for both wheezing (p less than 0.05) and nonwheezing (p less than 0.002) illnesses. In sum, maternal smoking is associated with a higher rate of LRIs in the first year, particularly when mothers smoked a pack or more per day and when the child did not use day care.\r"

During 1 year in the Framingham Children's Study, data were obtained for an average of more than 10 hours per day for 8.6 +/- 1.8 days for the children, for 8.3 +/- 2.1 days for their mothers, and for 7.7 +/- 2.3 days for their fathers. Children of active mothers (average Caltrac accelerometer counts per hour greater than the median) were 2.0 times as likely to be active as children of inactive mothers (95% confidence interval = 0.9, 4.5); the relative odds ratio of being active for the children of active fathers was 3.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.5, 8.3). When both parents were active, the children were 5.8 times as likely to be active (95% confidence interval = 1.9, 17.4) as children of two inactive parents. Possible mechanisms for the relationship between parents' and child's activity levels include the parents' serving as role models, sharing of activities by family members, enhancement and support by active parents of their child's participation in physical activity, and genetically transmitted factors that predispose the child to increased levels of physical activity.\r"

All patients were given magnesium orally (6 mg/kg daily of elemental magnesium) for up to 60 days. During treatment, serum magnesium, total and ionized calcium, intact PTH, calcitriol, and osteocalcin concentrations significantly increased, reaching control values. After a 3-day low-calcium diet, the patients had a significantly reduced delta-increment of PTH and calcitriol in comparison with values obtained during hypomagnesemia. After magnesium repletion, the delta-increments of both PTH and calcitriol, in response to the low-calcium diet, were not significantly different from control values. These data suggest that magnesium deficiency plays a pivotal role in altering mineral homeostasis in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

All had received cranial irradiation with a dose range to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of 27 to 47.5 Gy (estimated by a schedule of 16 fractions over 3 weeks) and had been tested on one or more occasions between 0.2 and 18.9 years after treatment. Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose. We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\r"

Cross-brain oxygen extraction was significantly higher (5.06 +/- 0.5 vs 2.05 +/- 0.8 ml/dl; p = 0.012) in the five neonates who survived with normal neurologic outcome than in the four who died or sustained severe brain damage. In contrast, global cerebral blood flow in the five neonates with normal neurologic outcome was significantly lower (25.6 +/- 8.2 vs 83.2 +/- 44.9 ml/100 gm brain/min; p less than 0.05) during the study period. The differences in cross-brain oxygen extraction and global cerebral blood flow between infants who had neurologic recovery and those who died or sustained brain damage occurred in the presence of acceptable values for intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure. Our preliminary data suggest that cross-brain oxygen extraction and possibly global cerebral blood flow may be important variables associated with severe neuronal injury and death after hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury.\r"

Preterm infants had 10-fold higher serum concentrations of AFP than did term infants at birth. The reduction of serum values of AFP was biphasic in both groups and differed significantly between the two groups. The first declining phase continued for approximately 4 months in preterm and for 2 months in term infants, and was related to the degree of prematurity. The AFP values reached adult levels by 12 months in preterm and by 9 months in term infants. The developmental pattern of the carbohydrate moiety of AFP was determined by ConA fractioning. The proportion of the ConA nonreactive subfraction of AFP in preterm and term infants at birth was 6% and 13%, respectively; it increased more rapidly in term than in preterm infants but reached 85% to 95% by the age of 6 months in both infant groups. Our results indicate that the postnatal maturation of AFP synthesis is dependent on gestational age. Malignant recurrences of neonatal sacrococcygeal teratomas were associated with an increase in serum concentration of AFP and a decrease in the proportion of the ConA nonreactive subfraction of AFP.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a single prophylactic dose of synthetic surfactant would reduce mortality and morbidity rates, we performed a randomized, controlled trial of Exosurf Neonatal at 19 hospitals in the United States. The Exosurf preparation (5 ml/kg) was instilled into the endotracheal tube of premature infants weighing 700 to 1100 gm during mechanical ventilation, as soon as practical after birth. Control infants were treated with air (5 ml/kg). Dose administration was performed in secrecy by clinicians who did not reveal for 2 years what they had instilled. A total of 222 infants received air and 224 received the synthetic surfactant; 36 infants with congenital pneumonia or malformations were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. By the age of 28 days, there were 44 deaths in the air group and 27 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.022). By the age of 1 year after term there were 61 deaths in the air group and 35 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.002). Although there was no reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, a significant reduction in the number of deaths attributed to respiratory distress syndrome, a significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary air leaks, and significantly lower requirements for oxygen and mean airway pressure indicated that lung disease was less severe in the Exosurf-treated infants. There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infection. The results indicate that a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf, in high-risk premature infants treated soon after birth, reduces the number of deaths from respiratory distress syndrome and the overall mortality rate.\r"

The patients were evaluated and then randomly selected to receive either dexamethasone or saline solution according to a stratification based on risk factors for postextubation stridor: age, duration of intubation, upper airway trauma, circulatory compromise, and tracheitis. Dexamethasone, 0.5 mg/kg, was given every 6 hours for a total of six doses beginning 6 to 12 hours before and continuing after endotracheal extubation in a pediatric intensive care setting. There was no statistical difference in incidence of postextubation stridor in the two groups; 23 of 77 children in the placebo group and 16 of 76 in the dexamethasone group had stridor requiring therapy (p = 0.21). We conclude that the routine use of corticosteroids for the prevention of postextubation stridor during uncomplicated pediatric intensive care airway management is unwarranted.\r"

Although typically regarded as a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with an activation constant of about 3 microM. Consistent with its classification as an antagonist, CGP inhibited norepinephrine-stimulated cyclase activity and did so at concentrations that had little or no stimulatory effect. CGP also inhibited activity stimulated by the atypical agonist [(R*,R*)-4-[2-[[2[(3-chlorophenyl)-2- hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenyl]phenoxyacetic acid (BRL 37344), but only at CGP concentrations that stimulated activity when tested alone. The beta-1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 blocked norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but did not inhibit the activity stimulated by CGP. Together, these results indicate that CGP modulates IBAT adenylate cyclase by interacting with two receptors. One is the beta-1 receptor of which CGP is a high-affinity antagonist. The second appears to be an atypical receptor of which CGP is a partial agonist.\r"

Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of these novel compounds were compared with those of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imin e] and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, one of the major drugs for treatment of partial and generalized seizures in humans. For comparative evaluation, the compounds were injected i.p. at the following doses: 1 to 10 mg/kg (CGP 37849 or CGP 39551), 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (MK-801) and 20 to 40 mg/kg (carbamazepine), respectively. In contrast to carbamazepine, CGP 37849, CGP 39551 and MK-801 exerted only weak anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats and did not increase the focal seizure threshold. The weak anticonvulsant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats were associated with profound untoward behavioral effects. The behavioral syndrome induced by the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats was characterized by marked ataxia, hyperactivity and, in case of CGP 37849 and MK-801, stereotypies, such as head weaving. The low or absent effectiveness of the novel NMDA receptor antagonists against kindled seizures suggests that these compounds will not be clinically useful antiepileptics against partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Furthermore, in view of the recent clinical findings on psychotomimetic effects of MK-801 in epileptic patients, the similarities in the excitatory effects produced by CGP 39551, CGP 37849 and MK-801 in kindled rats may indicate that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may also produce psychotomimetic effects in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of nitric oxide (NO) as inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitter was studied in the rat gastric fundus. NO induced tetrodotoxin-resistant NANC relaxations in longitudinal muscle strips similar to those induced by electrical stimulation. Incubation with the stereospecific inhibitors of the NO biosynthesis NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) resulted in an increase of the basal tension which was reversed partly by L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. L-NMMA and L-NNA inhibited the relaxations to electrical stimulation, but not those induced by ATP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), norepinephrine or NO. This inhibitory effect was prevented by L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. In a second series of experiments, the gastric fundus served as donor tissue in a superfusion bioassay with de-endothelialized rings of rabbit aorta as detector tissue. The fundus released a labile factor with vasodilator activity upon electrical stimulation. This release was inhibited by tetrodotoxin and L-NNA, whereas it was increased by L-arginine. The biological activity was enhanced by superoxide dismutase and eliminated by hemoglobin. Our results indicate that NO is formed and released upon brief stimulation of the NANC nerves in the rat gastric fundus which is essential for the transient relaxations in this preparation. Therefore, we suggest NO or a NO releasing substance as inhibitory NANC transmitter in the rat gastric fundus.\r"

  ".U": "91132445\r", 
  ".W": "The opioid receptor types involved in supraspinal and spinal heroin-induced analgesia in Swiss Webster and ICR mice were determined by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) and intrathecal (i.t.) administration of opioid agonists and antagonists. Also, comparisons were made with morphine. Antinociception was measured by changes in tail-flick latency. In Swiss Webster mice, i.c.v. heroin like [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin, a delta receptor opioid agonist, activated supraspinal delta opioid receptors as evidenced by inhibition of analgesia by coadministration of naltrindole, a delta receptor antagonist. Lack of effect of i.t. yohimbine and methysergide vs. i.c.v. heroin indicated that spinal descending noradrenergic and serotonergic systems were not involved. Heroin and [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin were also matched in producing additive interactions with i.t. opioids. Also, i.c.v. heroin like [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin did not activate a dynorphin-mediated antianalgesic system. In ICR mice, i.c.v. heroin receptor selectivity matched that of i.c.v. Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-Gly-ol5, a selective mu receptor opioid agonist. Analgesia was inhibited by pretreatment with i.c.v. beta-funaltrexamine, a nonequilibrium mu receptor antagonist. Intrathecal administration of methysergide inhibited i.c.v. heroin-induced analgesia whereas i.t. yohimbine had no effect, which indicated that a descending serotonergic system but not a noradrenergic system was involved. Low doses of i.t. naloxone and nor-binaltorphimine increased the analgesic effect. This effect was consistent with activation of an antianalgesic system by i.c.v. heroin, which was mediated by dynorphin A in the spinal cord. Desensitization of the antianalgesic system also resulted in increased analgesia. In both Swiss Webster and ICR mice, i.t. heroin-induced analgesia involved spinal mu receptors like those stimulated by Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-Gly-ol5. Analgesia was inhibited by i.t. naloxone. In both strains, i.t. heroin, like i.t. Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-Gly-ol5, produced an additive interaction with i.t. clonidine. In conclusion, the supraspinal receptors activated by heroin are different between Swiss Webster and ICR mice. In both strains, the receptor selectivities assigned to heroin did not match those for morphine. Heroin did not act by being biotransformed to morphine.\r"

Bile and urine were collected for 6 hr. Some 70 to 75% was recovered in urine as mercapturates. The half-lives of the urinary excretion were the same for the two mercapturates: 18 min and approximately 130 min, respectively, for the rapid and the slow phase. In bile only 1.5% of the dose of (R) and (S)-IU-G was found; two unidentified metabolites were also found. In rats with ligated kidneys, 4% of the dose of each glutathione conjugate was excreted in bile. Again, the two unidentified metabolites were found. In the isolated recirculating liver perfusion experiments, 1.4% of the administered GSH conjugates was found in bile. The concentration of the GSH conjugates in the perfusion medium remained constant and no other metabolites were formed. When (RS)-alpha-bromoisovalerylurea itself was added to the perfusate, the GSH conjugates in bile increased rapidly. The results show that the GSH conjugate in blood is little excreted in bile due to a slow uptake of the conjugate by the liver. The diastereomeric GSH conjugates show no stereoselectivity in their pharmacokinetics, indicating that the rate limiting step in this process is not stereoselective.\r"

  ".W": "L-651,582 (5-amino-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-3,5-dichlorobenzyl]-1,2,3-triazole-4- carboxamide), which is active in vivo against coccidiosis caused by the intracellular parasitic protozoan Eimeria tenella, is also effective against this organism in tissue culture in Maden Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) host cells. L-651,582 inhibited 45Ca++ uptake, as well as [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation into soluble nucleotide pools, in MDBK cells at concentrations similar to those required for antiparasitic activity (IC50 = 0.3 microgram/ml). However, the drug did not inhibit the [3H] hypoxanthine incorporation into the nucleotide pools of the intracellular E. tenella under the same conditions. The antiparasitic activity of several L-651,582 analogs paralleled their ability to inhibit [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation in MDBK cells. L-651,582 similarly inhibited the growth of the intracellular parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii in vitro with either HeLa cells or Normal Human Fibroblasts as host cells. The IC50 for inhibition of T. gondii growth in normal human fibroblasts was similar to that for [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation inhibition. In HeLa cells, however, 40-fold higher levels were required for the inhibition of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation than were required to inhibit parasite growth, showing that antiparasitic activity was not a consequence of the alteration in host nucleotide metabolism. This was also consistent with the observation that the effect of L-651,582 against E. tenella in MDBK cells was not reversed by the addition of nutrients involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. This study suggests that L-651,582 has antiparasitic activity which correlates with host cell effects and which may be a result of blocking Ca++ entry in the host cells, but is not the result of an alteration of host nucleotide biosynthesis.\r"

This was achieved through the use of transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the rat m1 or m3 receptor genes. A homogeneous population of the m2 subtype was obtained from rat heart tissue. Our data indicate that the cardioselective antagonists (gallamine, methoctramine, AF-DX 116 and himbacine) display the following rank order of potency for both displacing ligand binding to the primary site on the receptor and allosterically decelerating ligand dissociation: m2 greater than m1 greater than m3. Schild analysis showed the following rank order of the magnitude of gallamine's cooperative interactions with the three receptor subtypes: m3 greater than m1 greater than m2. By comparison, the ion-channel blockers (verapamil, phencyclidine and quinidine) exhibited a rank order of potency for cooperative effects similar to that of cardioselective antagonists; however, these blockers did not show appreciable specificity in their interaction with the receptor primary binding site. There was a lack of correlation between the displacement of ligand binding and the allosteric potencies of the allosteric antagonists at each of the three muscarinic receptor subtypes, thus revealing the complex nature of interaction (both competitive and allosteric) between many of these compounds with the muscarinic receptor. Despite the fact that the majority of allosteric muscarinic antagonists are also K+ channel blockers, the use of pertussis toxin did not support the notion that this channel represents the allosteric site coupled to the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "There are reports of an increase in renin release after the administration of fenoldopam which probably results from the activation of dopamine (DA)-1 receptors located on juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. However, the functional significance of this finding in terms of modulating the tubular response to DA-1 receptor stimulation remains to be determined. In this study we have examined the effect of an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity during the administration of fenoldopam on the natriuretic and diuretic action of this compound. Intravenous infusion of fenoldopam (0.5 microgram/kg/min) for 30 min produced significant increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion without causing any changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure, a phenomenon suggestive of a direct tubular site of action. In animals treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, both the diuretic and natriuretic effects of fenoldopam were potentiated markedly. In comparison with fenoldopam infusion in control animals, urine output, urinary sodium excretion and potassium excretion increased by approximately 4-fold (375 +/- 24 vs. 97 +/- 3 microliters/30 min, P less than .01), 9-fold (50 +/- 5 vs. 6 +/- 1 microEq/30 min, P less than .001) and 2-fold (46 +/- 8 vs. 24 +/- 2 microEq/30 min, P less than .05), respectively, in animals receiving a bolus injection of captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) 30 min before onset of fenoldopam infusion. Whereas no significant changes in renal blood flow occurred when fenoldopam was given to control rats, in animals treated with captopril, fenoldopam produced a modest but significant increase in renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91132451\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms of pinacidil-induced direct vasodilation were studied in vitro in RMA and RAO. In RMA, pinacidil produced dose-dependent relaxations of norepinephrine (5 microM)-induced contractions with an IC50 of 0.2 microM. This component of pinacidil relaxation appeared to be dependent on K+ conductance because pretreatment with tetraethylammonium (10 mM), Ba++ (0.5 mM), glyburide (1 microM) and 20 mM K+ all caused a rightward shift of the pinacidil dose-response curve (DRC) and a corresponding increase in the pinacidil IC50. However, additional relaxation effects of pinacidil were still evident in the presence of various K+ channel blockers. Pinacidil also showed a relaxation DRC under the condition of 80 mM K+ contraction in both RMA and RAO with IC50 values of 27 and 50 microM, respectively. Pinacidil could also produce maximal relaxation in RMA and RAO remained unaffected in 145 mM K+ (zero Na+) depolarizing solution suggesting a lack of dependence on Na(+)-Ca++ exchange mechanism for this action of pinacidil. Studies using 1 or 3 min pulse labeling with 45Ca showed an absence of an inhibitory effect of pinacidil (at 50 and 100 microM) on unidirectional 45Ca influx stimulated by high-K+. Net 45Ca uptake studies showed that pinacidil inhibited high-K+ stimulated 45Ca uptake at 100 but not at 50 microM. Ryanodine (10-100 microM) was used as a tool to investigate the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in this action of pinacidil. Under the condition in which ryanodine (10-100 microM) treatment was found to cause the SR to be nonfunctional, pinacidil relaxation DRC remained unaltered, suggesting a lack of a stimulatory effect of pinacidil on SR Ca++ accumulation. These data thus show that the K+ channel-independent effect of pinacidil does not involve to any significant degree an effect of pinacidil on plasmalemmal voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels, SR Ca++ stores, Na(+)-Ca++ exchange or membrane hyperpolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The administration of methamphetamine (METH) to experimental animals results in damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. We have demonstrated previously that the excitatory amino acids may be involved in this neurotoxicity. For example, several compounds which bind to the phenyclidine site within the ion channel linked to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor protected mice from the METH-induced loss of neostriatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and dopamine content. The present study was conducted to characterize further the role of the excitatory amino acids in mediating the neurotoxic effects of METH. The administration of three or four injections of METH (10 mg/kg) every 2 hr to mice produced large decrements in neostriatal dopamine content (80-84%) and in tyrosine hydroxylase activity (65-74%). A dose-dependent protection against these METH-induced decreases was seen with two noncompetitive NMDA antagonists, ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 (25-50 mg/kg/injection), both of which are thought to bind to a polyamine or sigma site associated with the NMDA receptor complex, and with two competitive NMDA antagonists, CGS 19755 (25-50 mg/kg/injection) and NPC 12626 (150-300 mg/kg/injection). Moreover, an intrastriatal infusion of NMDA (0.1 mumol) produced a slight but significant loss of neostriatal dopamine which was potentiated in mice that also received a systemic injection of METH. The results of these studies strengthen the hypothesis that the excitatory amino acids play a critical role in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage induced by METH.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular smooth muscle function does not necessarily deteriorate with advancing age. However, although base-line function may be well maintained, the ability to adapt to stress may decline. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that development of denervation supersensitivity may be impaired in older animals. Fischer-344 rats (6, 12, 20, 24 and 27 months old) were treated with reserpine 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg i.p. for 7 days, a dose which was sufficient to deplete fully vascular norepinephrine content. Isometric contractile responses to phenylephrine and serotonin of isolated tail artery rings were determined. In the oldest animals studied, 27 months, chronic reserpine treatment resulted in depressed tail artery contractile responses, perhaps due to a toxic effect of the reserpine treatment. Reserpine-induced supersensitivity, reflected by a decreased EC50, developed to both agonists at all other ages studied. For serotonin, the degree of reserpine-induced supersensitivity did not change with age. However, for phenylephrine, the shift in the concentration-response curve after reserpine treatment was less in 6-month-old rats as compared to all other ages. There was no change in the development of supersensitivity from 12 to 24 months of age. These findings suggest that the development of reserpine-induced supersensitivity is not impaired in blood vessels of older animals and that the ability to adapt to changing conditions is also maintained with age.\r"

Our results show that all ligands used, except 1,3-di-ortho-tolyl-guanidine, inhibit both neuronal [3H]norepinephrine accumulation in the rat tail artery and specific [3H] desmethylimipramine binding in the rat brain. Except for (+)-SKF 10047, the order of potency of the ligands used for inhibiting neuronal [3H]norepinephrine accumulation in the rat tail artery was similar to that measured for inhibition of specific [3H]desmethylimipramine binding in the rat brain. Despite these similarities, our results also suggest that haloperidol, (+)- and (-)3-PPP, MK 801, rimcazole and cocaine interact with the [3H]norepinephrine site in the rat tail artery and with the [3H]desmethylimipramine binding site in the rat brain in a complex fashion. These studies demonstrate an important action on the norepinephrine carrier by these sigma and PCP ligands in the rat tail artery and brain.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of the selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine and the selective M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 on ganglionic transmission were examined in anesthetized dogs, in order to elucidate a functional role of M1 and M2 receptors. Preganglionic or postganglionic stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves (SNS, 0.5-16 Hz) produced frequency-dependent increases in heart rate. Pirenzepine (3-100 microgram/kg) caused dose-dependent and significant inhibition of positive chronotropic response to preganglionic SNS but not to postganglionic SNS. AF-DX 116 (10-100 micrograms/kg) had no effect on the preganglionic SNS-induced tachycardia. The simultaneous administration of pirenzepine (30 micrograms/kg) and hexamethonium (C6, 1 mg/kg), and the subsequent administration of 10 mg/kg of C6, inhibited more potently the tachycardic responses to preganglionic SNS than each dose of C6 did by itself. The enhancement by pirenzepine of the C6-induced inhibition was evident at high frequencies (8 and 16 Hz) of SNS. In contrast, the blocking effect of C6 (1 and 10 mg/kg) on ganglionic transmission was significantly attenuated by AF-DX 116 (30 micrograms/kg). The attenuation by AF-DX 116 was observed at a wide range of stimulation frequency (0.5-8 Hz). These results suggest that M1 receptors play a facilitatory role in ganglionic transmission but M2 receptors do not contribute to the transmission when nicotinic pathway is intact. However, the activation of M2 receptors would further suppress ganglionic transmission when nicotinic transmission is inhibited. Under these conditions, activation of M1 receptors would mediate the transmission elicited by high frequency of stimulation.\r"

To better understand the dopamine substrates of this apomorphine response, we investigated the effects of four pharmacologically distinct dopamine antagonists on the apomorphine-induced loss of PPI. Apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) markedly decreased PPI for all prepulse intervals tested. This effect of apomorphine on PPI was reversed by pretreatments with the D2 antagonists spiperone and raclopride but not by pretreatment with the D1 antagonist SCH 23390. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine exhibited an \"inverted-U\" shaped dose-response curve, reversing the apomorphine-induced loss of PPI at low doses but not at high doses. High doses of both SCH 23390 and clozapine decreased PPI independent of apomorphine treatment. The effects of apomorphine on baseline startle amplitude were also differentially modified by these drugs: apomorphine potentiated startle amplitude in spiperone- and raclopride-pretreated animals, but apomorphine decreased startle amplitude in animals pretreated with SCH 23390 or high doses of clozapine. Prepulse inhibition has been shown to be markedly impaired in humans with schizophrenia. Since our present findings suggest that the activation of D2 dopamine receptors is responsible for the loss of PPI in rats, overactivity of D2 dopamine receptors might also be a substrate for PPI deficits in schizophrenia.\r"

The established method of cytochrome C reduction by superoxide was modified to measure superoxide production in vascular rings from rabbit aortae. The diabetogenic compound alloxan significantly increased superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. The nitrovasodilators nitroprusside and minoxidil exhibited contrasting effects. Nitroprusside inhibited alloxan-stimulated production of superoxide, but minoxidil had no effect, suggesting different mechanisms of action for these drugs. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on the production of superoxide stimulated by alloxan, demonstrating that superoxide production induced by this compound is not affected by mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase. These data demonstrate the use of a simple, rapid and inexpensive method for measuring superoxide produced by intact vessels. This may be useful in testing drugs exhibiting antioxidant and vasoactive properties. Finally, because superoxide is implicated in the destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and the presence of the vasodilator nitroprusside reduces superoxide production, it is concluded that some nitrovasodilators may have additional vascular effects through the suppression of superoxide formation.\r"

When given i.p., PGE2 induced a dose- and time-dependent diarrhea; the shortest post-treatment time for diarrhea onset was approximately 7 min, at a PGE2 dose of 200 micrograms/kg. At this dose, PGE2 also produced accumulation of fluid in the small intestine and in the colon (enteropooling). The enteropooling reached its maximum by 9 min and did not decrease until approximately 11 min (i.e., 2 to 4 min after the mean time for diarrhea onset). PGE2 treatment altered neither gastric emptying nor gastrointestinal propulsion, but strongly enhanced the expulsion of a glass bead from the colon (i.e., decreased the time to bead expulsion). The shortest time to expulsion of the glass bead was observed at 200 micrograms/kg i.p. The induction of diarrhea by PGE2 was unaffected by cecectomy, or sham-cecectomy, but the dose-response curve for time to onset of diarrhea by i.p. PGE2 was displaced to the right in animals with ligations of the ileo-ceco-colonic (ICC) junctions. The intraluminal fluid accumulation in the colon, evaluated in mice with ICC ligations, was increased by PGE2 administration within 2 min and remained greater than in vehicle-treated animals until the onset of diarrhea. The stimulation of colonic bead expulsion produced by i.p. PGE2 in control mice was not observed in animals with acute ICC ligations, even at i.p. doses up to 800 micrograms/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dissociation constants (KA) were determined for each of the agonists at their respective receptor subtypes. The KA values for PE and OXY at the alpha-1 receptor were 316 nM and 1.82 microM, respectively, while the KA for 5-HT at the 5-HT2 receptor was 478 nM. Concentration-response curves for each agonist were analyzed by the Black and Leff operational model of pharmacological agonism to determine efficacy (tau) and slope factor values. The estimated tau for PE (16.02) was much greater than the tau for either OXY (4.15) or 5-HT (2.95), which had similar efficacies. Using a previously described drug concentration paradigm, a mutual-effect amplification of the 5-HT-induced contractile response was observed with mixtures of 5-HT and PE, whereas mixtures of OXY and 5-HT elicited a mutual-effect amplification of the observed response to OXY alone. In both cases, the theoretical concentration-response curve constructed using the Poch and Holzmann method of equiactive substitution demonstrated that mutual-effect amplification was largely the result of simple additivity of agonist effects. In addition, estimates of tau and slope factor determined from the Black and Leff equation were substituted into the Leff model of mutual-effect amplification and used to accurately predict the location of the concentration-response curves elicited by mixtures of 5-HT and PE, as well as mixtures of OXY and 5-HT. This represents the first time a mathematical model has been used to accurately predict the outcome of coactivation of the alpha-1 and 5-HT2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY), which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis). Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY, (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects. The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips. Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88. Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold, P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors. Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21], mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30]. The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure. Also, (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice. Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer. However, it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile.\r"

  ".U": "91132463\r", 
  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of the isolated rat mesenteric vascular bed resulted in a frequency-dependent pressor response, which could be potentiated by increasing concentrations of renin substrate (synthetic tetradecapeptide). This potentiating effect appeared to be mediated by tissue conversion of renin substrate to angiotensin II because the response 1) could be mimicked by angiotensin II, 2) was accompanied by an increase in angiotensin II production and 3) was blocked by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinaprilat and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin ([Sar1,Ile5,Ala8]angiotensin II). To assess the role of this tissue renin-angiotensin system in contributing to blood pressure regulation, spontaneously hypertensive rats were administered the prodrug ACE inhibitor quinapril at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Such administration resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 48 +/- 3 mm Hg, a greater than 95% inhibition of serum ACE activity, and a significant attenuation of the potentiating effect of renin substrate on electrically evoked contractions of isolated mesenteric beds. Significant reductions in blood pressure and the potentiating effect of renin substrate on the isolated mesenteric vasculature were still observed 24 and 48 hr after the last dose of quinapril. In contrast, serum ACE activity returned to normal levels within 48 hr after the last dose of quinapril. These results suggest that the changes in tissue renin-angiotensin system, and not the circulating system, are closely related to the blood pressure lowering effect of the ACE inhibitor, quinapril.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic opioid antagonist-induced functional supersensitivity and receptor upregulation on morphine tolerance was examined in Swiss Webster mice obtained from Taconic Farms and Charles River Laboratories. Mice were implanted s.c. with either naltrexone (NTX) or placebo pellets for 8 days. After 8 days, the pellets were removed, and 24 h later mice were either injected with morphine (50 or 100 mg/kg) or saline (acute tolerance protocol) or implanted with a 75-mg morphine or placebo pellet for 72 h (chronic tolerance protocol). Mice were tested for morphine analgesia 24 h after injections or 72 h after pellet implantations. Mice from Taconic Farms were more sensitive to morphine analgesia than Charles River mice, although the degree of tolerance in both strains was similar. Acute morphine produced a 1.7- and 1.9-fold increase in the ED50 for morphine analgesia in NTX and placebo pretreated mice, respectively. the chronic tolerance protocol produced the same shift (2.4-fold) in the ED50 in both NTX and placebo pretreated mice. In both tolerance protocols, NTX-pretreated mice were significantly more sensitive to the analgesic effects of morphine than placebo pretreated controls. Binding studies ([3H][D-Ala,2NMePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin) indicated an approximately 40% increase in opioid receptor density with no significant alteration in affinity after chronic NTX treatment. These results indicate that acute and chronic tolerance to morphine develops comparably in control and upregulated, supersensitive mice. These findings suggest that new binding sites in upregulated mice mediate tolerance similarly to existing binding sites and that the degree of tolerance is unrelated to the density of opioid receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin (ET) exerts various biological actions in mesangial cells, including stimulation of proliferation, contraction and phospholipase C activation. We investigated the presence of specific ET receptors on cultured rat mesangial cells, incubating the cells in the presence of [125I]ET-1 both at 22 and 4 degrees C. ET binding was time- and temperature-dependent and achieved equilibrium at 2 hr at 22 degrees C and at 5 hr at 4 degrees C. Scatchard analyses of equilibrium saturation curves with [125I]ET-1 and homologous competition curves revealed the presence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites (Kd = 31.4 +/- 7.08 pM). Heterologous competition experiments with ET-3 and sarafotoxin, however, indicated the presence of two binding sites for ET-related peptides in mesangial cells with a Kd for ET-3 of 41.5 +/- 19.2 and of 374 +/- 38.5 nM. Nifedipine and arginine-vasopressin failed to compete for ET binding sites. Preincubation of the cells with 1 nM ET-1 caused a dramatic decrease in ET binding capacity (from 0.5-0.02 fmol/100,000 cells) without affecting the Kd for the receptors (38 pM). ET receptor down regulation was not prevented by protein kinase C inhibition with H-7 and sangiovamycin, or after down regulation of protein kinase C induced by 24-hr preincubation with phorbol myristate acetate. ET receptor down regulation also exerts functional effects, as we found a decrease in intracellular-free calcium response to ET-1 after long-term preincubation with the same agonist. Our results are consistent with the presence of two binding sites for ET in rat mesangial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Free-flow micropuncture and in situ microperfusion techniques were used to define the site of action and relative effect of MK447 [2-aminomethyl-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-iodophenol hydrochloride] vs. furosemide in the rat kidney. MK447 was administered i.v. at 5 mg/kg/hr. Infusion of this drug had little effect on proximal tubule reabsorption of water, Na+ and K+. In contrast, reabsorption of these constituents by the loop of Henle was significantly reduced. There was a tendency for water and Na+ reabsorption to rise and for K+ secretion to fall along the distal tubule. These latter effects can be explained by the contributions of an increased distal flow rate and increased tubule fluid K+ concentration. Net addition of K+ beyond the distal tubule was observed. This may be due to effect of the drug on the collecting duct system or juxtamedullary nephrons. The effects of MK447 and furosemide on loop of Henle reabsorption were compared in microperfusion experiments. Furosemide reduced Na+, K+ and water reabsorption by the loop, whereas MK447 had no effect. A 6-bromophenol sulfate ester of MK447 significantly reduced loop reabsorption. From these observations, we conclude that MK447 affects water and electrolyte reabsorption by the loop of Henle and beyond the superficial late distal tubule. The fact that a potential metabolite, but not MK447, significantly reduced reabsorption by the in situ, perfused loop of Henle supports the hypothesis that the p.o. and i.v. effects of MK447 are dependent on metabolism.\r"

In time course experiments, the protection by both compounds was evident up to 48 hr before ethanol administration. Both drugs were also protected, from about 24 hr, from gastric mucosal damage induced by aspirin and hydrochloric acid. In order to examine the role of endogenous prostaglandins and sulfhydryls in this protection, indomethacin and N-ethylmaleimide were used, of which only the sulfhydryl alkylator antagonized (by about 50%) the protection by pyrazole and 3-methylpyrazole. Studies with monastral blue B revealed the protective role of both pyrazole and 3-methylpyrazole against early vascular injury in the gastric mucosa. We conclude that because both the ADH-inhibitor pyrazole and the noninhibitor derivatives of pyrazole exert gastro-protection, and because both compounds protect against aspirin and HCI, ADH inhibition is not involved in this protection. We also suggest that although prostaglandins appear to have minimal involvement in the mechanism of protection, endogenous sulfhydryls may be important mediators. Furthermore, the functional and structural mechanism of this protection seems to be the prevention of acute vascular injury.\r"

  ".W": "In pithed and anesthetized rats, laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to evaluate the role of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating sympathetic responses in acral regions of the cutaneous circulation. The intravenous administration of the selective alpha-1 agonist, phenylephrine, was a more potent vasopressor agent than BH-T 933 (a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist) in pithed rats. However, BH-T 933 was more potent and more efficacious than phenylephrine in reducing cutaneous microvascular perfusion (CP). BH-T 933 also caused a greater increase in cutaneous microvascular resistance. Neural and humoral sympathetic effects on CP were characterized with selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin and rauwolscine, respectively). It was found that frequency-related reductions in CP elicited by sciatic nerve stimulation were antagonized by prazosin, but not by rauwolscine. In fact, rauwolscine enhanced neurally evoked reductions in CP at the highest stimulation frequencies. However, both prazosin and rauwolscine antagonized reductions in CP elicited by electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar outflow (sympathoadrenal activation). Ganglionic stimulation (intravenous 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium) also caused a profound, transient reduction in CP that was abolished by rauwolscine, but was not significantly altered by prazosin. In contrast, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium-induced increases in mean arterial pressure were reduced by prazosin, but not by rauwolscine. In ketamine-anesthetized rats, rauwolscine caused a dose-related increase in CP without altering mean arterial pressure, whereas prazosin lowered mean arterial pressure but did not alter CP. We conclude that acral regions of the cutaneous vasculature are more sensitive to alpha-2 vis-a-vis alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous in vivo electrochemical studies in the normotensive rat have shown that there was a positive correlation between the hypotensive effect of low doses of clonidine (8-40 nmol/kg i.v.) and the inhibition of the metabolic activity of catecholaminergic neurons within the nucleus reticularis region in the brain stem. Higher doses of the drug (200 nmol/kg i.v.) were required to decrease the metabolic activity in the locus ceruleus, which is involved in the sedative effect of clonidine. To investigate further the pharmacological mechanism involved in the hypotensive effect of imidazolines, low doses of antagonists were injected centrally in the cisterna magna (5 nmol/kg intracisternal): idazoxan, an imidazoline that labels nonadrenergic imidazoline-preferring sites and yohimbine, which is a classical alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist. Our results show that idazoxan very potently antagonizes both the hypotensive effect of clonidine and neuronal inhibition on the nucleus reticularis lateralis region but not in the locus ceruleus. The opposite effect is observed with yohimbine, i.e., neither the hypotensive effect nor the neuronal inhibition produced by clonidine on the nucleus reticularis lateralis region were affected but it prevented the inhibitory effect of clonidine on locus ceruleus neuronal metabolic activity. In conclusion, we confirm the hypothesis that the hypotensive action of imidazoline is due to an interaction of these substances with imidazoline-preferring receptors in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata whereas its sedative effect is related to an action on alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

AIII was about 10 times less potent, the slope of its concentration-response curve was less steep and its rate of onset slower than that of AII. The responses of both AII and AIII were inhibited with equal potency by the surmountable AII antagonist Phe4, Tyr8-AII and its unsurmountable analog Sar1, Leu8-AII but the kinetic patterns of inhibition by both were less well defined with the agonist AIII than with AII. The addition of AIII to tissues which had exhibited a maximal response to AII did not increase the level of contraction, in contrast to the case when norepinephrine was added to tissues contracted by AII. Both AII and AIII displaced [125I]AII binding from rabbit adrenal membranes; AIII was 6 times less potent than AII but displayed competitive kinetics as an inhibitor of [125I]AII binding. In further studies two binding sites for [125I]AII were identified in adrenal membranes, having KD values of 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 19.6 +/- 2.3 nM, respectively. Each site was inhibited by both AII and AIII and the ratio of the apparent Ki values for the two hormones was not significantly different. The Hill coefficient for the high affinity site was, however, lower for AIII than AII. We interpret our data to suggest that AII and AIII act on the same receptors. AIII apparently binds less efficiently than does AII in both rabbit adrenal membranes and rabbit aortic strips.\r"

A significant (P less than .001) linear correlation (r = 0.94) was found between binding site affinity and adenylate cyclase stimulation (EC50) for forskolin and the nine structural analogs. Adenylate cyclase activity was also significantly correlated with the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of these substances on isolated guinea pig atria. Compounds with K1 values between 0.020 and 1.136 microM produced concentration-dependent increases in heart rate and contractile force in isolated spontaneous and electrically paced guinea pig atria, respectively. In contrast, an analog with a K1 of 3.174 microM caused significant (P less than .05) negative chronotropic and inotropic effects at concentrations above 10 microM. The optimal separation between positive inotropic and chronotropic activity was found with compounds displaying potent [3H]forskolin binding site affinity but moderate adenylate cyclase stimulation, i.e., K1 and EC50 values of approximately 0.05 to 0.10 and 3 microM, respectively. The results of this study show that the forskolin analog, P87-7692 [7-desacetyl-7-(O-propionyl)-hydroxyl amino-carbonyl-forskolin], has marked activity with a wide separation between positive inotropic (248 +/- 41%) and chronotropic effects (43 +/- 13%) at 6.2 microM and may serve as a prototype for a forskolin-based cardiotonic.\r"

A selective D-2 receptor antagonist, S-sulpiride, counteracted the DA-induced inhibition of Asp and Glu release, but a selective D-1 antagonist, SCH 23390, showed no effect.

MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro hydrolysis of [Leu]enkephalin added to plasma collected from 2-day-old chicks was studied with two different techniques: thin-layer chromatography separation of intact [3H]-[Leu]enkephalin from its [3H]-Tyr-containing metabolites and high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection assay of [Leu]enkephalin disappearance and Tyr-containing metabolite accumulation. The radiometric assay evaluated enkephalin hydrolysis at close to presumed physiological concentrations of this peptide, whereas the liquid chromatography assay necessitated 100-fold higher peptide concentrations to achieve adequate sensitivity. Similar results were obtained with both techniques. We found that the in vitro hydrolysis of [Leu]enkephalin is more rapid in chick plasma (half-life, 0.7-1 min) than in rat (half-life, 2-2.5 min) or mouse (half-life, 9-14 min) plasma. Comparison of the rate of enkephalin hydrolysis and pattern of metabolite accumulation in the absence vs. the presence of various peptidase inhibitors suggested that a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, probably aminopeptidase M, is the primary enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of enkephalin by chick plasma, and that less than 1% of the total hydrolysis of [Leu]-enkephalin by chick plasma is attributable to dipeptidyl carboxy-peptidase activity. This pattern of enzyme activities differs from that which we identified previously in rat and mouse plasma.\r"

[3H]Dihydroalprenolol ( [3H] DHA) was the radioligand used in these previous studies to measure beta adrenoceptors. In this study, we compared the binding characteristics of [3H]DHA with those of [125I]iodopindolol ( [125I]PIN) and used [125I]IPIN to study effects of lesioning serotonergic nerves on the regulation of beta adrenoceptors. A comparison was made in homogenates prepared from rat frontal cortex of the specific binding of [3H]DHA with that of [125I]IPIN to beta adrenoceptors. Nonlinear regression analysis of saturation experiments of [3H]DHA binding to cortical homogenates indicated that a two-component binding model fit the data significantly better than a one-component model. A dissociation constant value of 0.47 +/- 0.16 nM and a Bmax value of 62 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein were obtained for the high-affinity site. The low-affinity site was poorly defined. Rosenthal transformations of the saturation isotherms for [3H]DHA binding were clearly curvilinear. By contrast, nonlinear regression analysis of saturation experiments of the binding of [125I]IPIN indicated that the binding of this radioligand was described adequately by a one-component model and yielded a dissociation constant value of 147 +/- 10 pM with a Bmax of 80 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein. Rosenthal transformations of the [125I]IPIN data were linear. From such data, it was inferred that [3H]DHA binds to some site in addition to beta adrenoceptors, whereas [125I]IPIN does not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The renal processing of the glutathione conjugate of menadione, 2-methyl-3-S-glutathionyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (thiodione) was studied in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Thiodione at an initial concentration of 600 microM was eliminated rapidly from the perfusate (clearance = 6.0 ml/min). Renal disposition could be ascribed to metabolism and transport of the glutathione conjugate. Renal metabolism by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was inhibited by AT-125 [L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid] (0.5 mM) resulting in a reduction of the thiodione clearance to 0.86 ml/min. Further reduction of the renal clearance of thiodione was achieved by a combination of AT-125 (0.5 mM) and probenecid (0.5 mM), resulting in a renal clearance of 0.58 ml/min which equalled glomerular filtration rate. Addition of thiodione to the perfusate caused loss of renal function and cellular damage, as reflected by a decreased glucose reabsorption and an increased urinary secretion of lactate dehydrogenase, respectively. Thiodione-induced nephrotoxicity was ameliorated by AT-125 and prevented completely by a combination of AT-125 and probenecid. Aminooxyacetic acid (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of beta-lyase, did not afford protection against the nephrotoxic action of thiodione. From our results it can be concluded that the thiodione-mediated toxicity in the isolated perfused rat kidney can be linked to cellular uptake by anionic transport systems and metabolism by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase.\r"

Salbutamol (Sal) also relaxed Cch-precontracted tissues, but this relaxant effect was extremely sensitive to the concentration of precontracting agent used: the maximal effect of Sal was 100, 79 and 28% reversal of tone in tissues precontracted with 2 x 10(-8), 10(-7) and 3 x 10(-7) M Cch. The effects of isoproterenol were antagonized by propranolol. Norepinephrine relaxations were antagonized by the beta-1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 (pA2 = 7.70) and the beta-2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (pA2 = 6.33). Sal-relaxations were antagonized by ICI 118,551 (pA2 = 8.91). Field stimulation in tissues precontracted with McNeil A343 (M1-selective muscarinic agonist) produced transient relaxations which were antagonized by ICI 89,406 but not ICI 118,551 (both 10(-9) to 10(-7) M). Thus, exogenous and endogenous catecholamines relax canine bronchial smooth muscle by activating both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors, although the latter seen to play a significant role only when low concentrations of Cch were used.\r"

BAE cell-conditioned medium was transferred onto rat fetal lung fibroblasts (RFL-6 cells) and the increase in cyclic GMP in these cells was used as a sensitive bioassay of EDRF/NO activity. BAE cells released a material that markedly enhanced cyclic GMP in RFL-6 cells. The synthesis of this substance could be stimulated with bradykinin (10 nM) or Ca++ ionophore A23187 (1 microM) and was completely prevented by treatment of the BAE cells with the EDRF/NO synthesis inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 microM) or NG-methyl-L-arginine (1 mM). Addition of hemoglobin (10 microM) or incubation of the RFL-6 detector cells with methylene blue (10 microM) also abolished the cyclic GMP increase in the RFL-6 cells. The release of EDRF/NO by bradykinin and A23187 was accompanied by an approximately 2-fold increase in the cyclic GMP content in the producing BAE cells (in the presence of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor M&B 22,948, 0.1 mM). Incubation of BAE cells with atrial natriuretic peptide (0.1 microM) or sodium nitroprusside (10 microM) enhanced cyclic GMP content of BAE cells 6.5-fold and 4.1-fold, respectively (in the presence of M&B 22,948, 0.1 mM). These increases in the cyclic GMP levels in BAE cells had no effect on basal or bradykinin- and A23187-stimulated release of EDRF/NO. Bradykinin (10 nM) and A23187 (1 microM) also stimulated prostacyclin production in BAE cells 2.4-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the presence of alpha, beta-methylene ATP (10(-6) M), the endothelium-independent contractions induced by alpha, beta-methylene ATP itself (10(-6) M) and by beta, gamma-methylene ATP (10(-5) M) were both abolished. The endothelium-dependent contraction induced by 2-methylthio ATP (10(-7) M) was not attenuated by alpha, beta-methylene ATP. The contraction induced by 2-methylthio ATP (10(-7) M) was attenuated markedly by reactive blue 2 (a P2Y antagonist) (3 x 10(-6) M), aspirin (5 x 10(-5) M), OKY-046 (thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor) (10(-5) M) and ONO-3708 (thromboxane A2 antagonist) (10(-8) M). However, these agents did not affect the endothelium-independent contraction induced by alpha, beta-methylene ATP (10(-6) M). Neither TMK-777 (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) (10(-7) M) nor superoxide dismutase (100 U/ml) plus catalase (1,000 U/ml) affected either contraction. The present experiments demonstrate that P2X-purinoceptors mediate endothelium-dependent contraction in the canine basilar artery, and that the endothelium-derived contracting factor in this system is probably thromboxane A2.\r"

All of the muscarinic agonists completely inhibited [3H](-)methyl-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to the M1 muscarinic receptor in the transfected B82 cells. Their apparent inhibition constant values for agonist/[3H](-)methyl-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate inhibition experiments correlate well with their EC50 values in stimulating phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis. Based on the maximal functional effects: (+)-cismethyl-dioxolane, oxotremorine-M, acetylcholine, carbachol and methacholine are most efficacious, McN-A-343 and arecoline are least efficacious, whereas the efficacies of oxotremorine and pilocarpine are intermediate. In addition, McN-A-343 inhibited carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis. Spare receptors were detected for oxotremorine-M, methacholine and carbachol, but not the rest of the agonists, by comparing the receptor-occupancy curves with the concentration-response curves. These results suggest that the presence of a quaternary nitrogen (trimethylammonium group) within the structure of the agonist may be important for the expression of full agonist activity.\r"

To clarify this, we compared the effects of CCK-8 sulfate, CCK-4 and gastrin in radioligand binding studies and longitudinal ileal contractility in vitro. Contraction to all three peptides was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-7)M), confirming the neuronal nature of the CCK receptors mediating contraction to all three peptides. Maximal CCK-8S contractions were inhibited by 80% in the presence of atropine (10(-6)M), and entirely by the combination of atropine and a substance P receptor antagonist (3 x 10(-5)M). CCK-4 and gastrin-induced contractions were unaffected by substance P receptor blockade, but were abolished by atropine. Two selective CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists, L-364,718 and L-365,260, respectively, were used to probe further the receptors involved in ileal contraction to this peptide family. Radioligand binding studies in mouse brain, rat pancreas and guinea pig stomach confirmed the selectivity of these antagonists. The CCK-A selective antagonist, L-364,718, potently inhibited ileal contractions to CCK-8S (-log KB = 9.35) with 10-fold lower affinity at receptors mediating contraction to CCK-4 (-log KB = 8.25). In contrast, the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260, did not affect contraction to CCK-8S (-log KB less than 7) but potently inhibited contraction to CCK-4 (-log KB = 9.24).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine was found to modulate the activity of the human basophil and lung mast cell (HLMC) differently. In the basophil, adenosine inhibited the anti-IgE stimulated release of histamine and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and increased total cell cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Substituted adenosine analogs had a rank order potency of: N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-phenylisopropyladenosine for the inhibition of immunoglobulin E-triggered mediator release from the basophil and increases in cAMP levels. The adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, antagonized both the NECA-induced inhibition of mediator release and elevations in cyclic nucleotide. The purinergic transport inhibitor, dipyridamole, reversed the inhibition by adenosine of histamine release but not LTC4 generation, suggesting that these two actions are mechanistically separable. Dipyridamole failed to modify the adenosine-induced elevation in cAMP. In contrast to the findings in the basophil, the response to adenosine in the HLMC was biphasic in nature. Thus, at low concentrations of the nucleoside, adenosine potentiated the release of histamine and LTC4 from immunologically activated HLMC, whereas at higher concentrations a counteractive inhibitory process was observed. Analogs of adenosine had the same effects on HLMC; NECA was more potent than R-phenylisopropyladenosine for both the potentiating and inhibitory components of the biphasic response. Low concentrations of adenosine analogs, which potentiated secretion, initiated modest elevations in cAMP levels, whereas higher concentrations, which inhibited secretion, significantly augmented cAMP levels. Although R-phenylisopropyladenosine was almost as potent as NECA at elevating cAMP in HLMC, it was not as efficacious. The NECA-induced modulation of HLMC mediator release and elevations in cAMP were antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At all five receptors, the (R)-enantiomers of trihexyphenidyl and hexbutinol displayed considerably higher affinities (up to 525-fold) than their corresponding (S)-isomers. The stereoselectivity ratios [inhibition constant(S)/inhibition constant(R)] for both pairs of enantiomers were lowest at m2 receptors, suggesting that less stringent configurational demands are made by this receptor subtype.

To initiate explorations of the molecular mechanisms and the underlying biochemical architecture of high-affinity neurotransmitter uptake systems, we have used gene transfer technology to establish and identify novel cellular models that express these systems. Human genomic DNA was transfected into mouse L-M fibroblasts and two independently arising, clonal cell lines (L-S1 and L-S2) have been identified as expressing high-affinity serotonin (5-HT) uptake systems. The 5-HT uptake characteristics of L-S1 and L-S2 are essentially comparable (in terms of Na+ dependence, temperature sensitivity, imipramine antagonizability, kinetic saturability and high affinities) and those of L-S1 have been reported previously. Furthermore, competition studies utilizing catecholamine neurotransmitters and their amino acid precursors demonstrated that these systems are highly specific for 5-HT. Several known inhibitors of high-affinity 5-HT uptake systems (including amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, nortriptyline, tryptamine, 5-methoxytryptamine and N-acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine) were assessed in terms of their respective potencies to inhibit 5-[3H]HT uptake by L-S1 and L-S2 cells. For L-S1 cells, the rank order of inhibitor potencies is imipramine greater than amitriptyline greater than fluoxetine greater than desipramine = nortriptyline greater than tryptamine greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine. For L-S2, the rank order is similar to that of L-S1 except that fluoxetine is more potent than amitriptyline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To characterize this tolerance phenomenon, rats were trained to perform an appetitive operant task which allowed daily quantification of working memory (accuracy of delayed matching-to-position), reference memory (accuracy of visual discrimination) and motor function (choice response latencies and inter-response times during delay). Daily s.c. injections of 0.2 mg/kg of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) caused no visible cholinergic signs, did not affect body weight or visual discrimination, but progressively impaired matching accuracy and lengthened response latencies and interresponse times. These effects recovered in seven of eight treated rats after termination of DFP treatment. Resumption of daily DFP at 0.1 mg/kg caused smaller impairments of both matching accuracy and response latency. After 21 injections of 0.2 mg/kg/day of DFP, rats were subsensitive to the hypothermia induced by acute oxotremorine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), as expected after OP-induced downregulation of muscarinic ACh receptors. Evidence for supersensitivity to scopolamine (0.03 and 0.056 mg/kg i.p.) in DFP-treated rats was mixed, with additive effects predominating on both the cognitive and motor aspects of the task. After 18 days of 0.1 mg/kg of DFP, AChE was inhibited 50 to 75% and muscarinic ACh receptor density was reduced 15 to 20% in hippocampus and frontal cortex. Progressive declines in AChE activity in hippocampus and frontal cortex across 15 daily doses with DFP at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg were observed in other rats; quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was significantly reduced in hippocampus after 15 doses at both levels of DFP. These results indicate that animals showing a definitive sign of tolerance to OP administration (subsensitivity to a cholinergic agonist) were also functionally impaired on both the mnemonic and motoric demands of a working memory task. The nature of this impairment suggests further that it results from compensatory changes in the central nervous system, e.g., muscarinic receptor downregulation, considered to produce \"tolerance\" to OPs in exposed animals.\r"

  ".W": "Dopaminergic structure-activity relationships of 2-aminoindans were evaluated for their ability to inhibit responses to stimulation of cardioaccelerator nerves in cats. The major observations were as follows: 1) Unsubstituted di-n-propyl- and diethyl 2-aminoindan derivatives do not inhibit responses to stimulation of cardioaccelerator nerve, although previous studies identified stimulation of DA2-receptors. 2) 4-Hydroxy, 4,7-dimethoxy and 4-hydroxy, 5-CH3, -CH2OH or -H substitutions on selected indan derivatives produce dopaminergic activity in the cardioaccelerator nerve preparation. 3) 4-Hydroxy-2-di-n-propylaminoindan is stereoselective with the R-isomer being more potent than the S-isomer. One derivative, 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-di-n-propyl-2-aminoindan (RD-211) produced dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Larger doses also inhibited cardiac responses to stimulation of cardioaccelerator nerve in vivo and in isolated right atria of cats. All of the above responses were significantly inhibited by the dopamine-receptor antagonist sulpiride and not by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. RD-211 also possesses high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors as revealed by radioligand binding studies. Results suggest that RD-211 stimulates dopamine DA2-receptors and may also activate 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors, but is inactive at alpha 2-adrenoceptors. RD-211 appears not to require metabolic activation even though it has the same chemical moiety as the aminotetralin homolog, which is a dopaminergic prodrug (5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-di-n-propylaminotetralin).\r"

  ".W": "The role of thyroid status in the ontogeny of beta adrenergic receptor control of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was assessed in hearts and kidneys of neonatal rats. Hyperthyroidism induced by administration of tri-iodothyronine on postnatal days 1 to 5 caused a reduction in the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cardiac ODC but subsequently accelerated the onset of the postweaning peak of the response; the latter effect was even more prominent when tri-iodothyronine administration was given on postnatal days 14 to 18. Hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil administration led to persistent subsensitivity of the cardiac ODC response to beta receptor stimulation. Kidney ODC, which does not become subject to beta receptor regulation until after weaning, was resistant to hyperthyroid-induced changes in reactivity, but hypothyroidism still resulted in long-term response deficits. These results suggest that thyroid hormone is permissive for normal development of the beta receptor-ODC link, and that the euthyroid state provides the optimal conditions for maturation of this signal transduction mechanism. The relative resistance of kidney ODC responses to alterations by hyperthyroidism further indicates that the effects of excess hormone can only be expressed when the receptor-enzyme link is already competent. Finally, thyroid status had equivalent effects on the abilities of vasopressin or angiotensin to stimulate ODC, suggesting that the site of thyroid hormone action is at a transduction locus common to several different receptor types.\r"

Hyperfilm exposed to sections of the whole pregnant uterus incubated with (-)-3-[125I]cyanopindolol with or without ICI 118,551 or atenolol showed a high density of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the longitudinal layer of the myometrium and in the placenta.

  ".W": "To study the role of serotonin in gastrointestinal function in mice, a peripheral deficiency was induced by administration of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, an inhibitor of tetrahydrobiopterin (6-[dihydroxypropyl-(L-erthro)-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydropterin) (BH4) biosynthesis. BH4 is an essential cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin. When 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) was administered for 4 days at the dose of 3 g/kg/day, serotonin decreased in the duodenum and colon to approximately 46 and 40% of the control levels, respectively. These mice showed visual signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction in addition to a remarkable decrease in uptake of a p.o. glucose load. The decrease in serotonin was prevented and prevention of the apparent dysfunction of digestive tract was observed by simultaneous administration of (6R)BH4. Serotonin levels in the brain and blood were also decreased by treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, an irreversible inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase. In contrast, DAHP had no effect on brain serotonin levels, presumably due to poor brain penetration. DAHP caused a rapid decrease (T1/2 of less than 12 hr) in the BH4 levels in all tissues examined, except in the brain. The BH4 level returned to within the normal range less than 24 hr after cessation of the administration of DAHP, a finding which suggests that the BH4 level is in a dynamic steady state maintained by rapid local biosynthesis. Thus, the local biosynthesis of BH4 supports normal digestive functions, presumably by controlling normal serotonin biosynthesis.\r"

  ".U": "91132495\r", 
  ".W": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the major physiological regulator of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the anterior pituitary. In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that hypothalamic CRF secretion is under stimulatory serotonergic control, although the receptor subtype(s) responsible have not been definitely determined. The acute effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 agonist, (+-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOB), were examined on a number of biochemical indices of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in vivo. DOB increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg. This effect is dose-dependent. Peak effects occurred 30 min postinjection and returned to basal levels by 4 hr after DOB injection. These effects of DOB are hypothesized to be mediated by the release of hypothalamic CRF because pretreatment with the CRF receptor antagonist (alpha-helical CRF9-41) significantly attenuated the ACTH response to DOB. Median eminence CRF content was also decreased following DOB administration in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (200 mg/kg i.p.), suggestive of release of CRF from median eminence terminals as a result of DOB activation of CRF neurons. DOB administration was without effect on brain CRF concentrations in all of the 12 extrahypothalamic brain regions studied 60 min after injection. These results, taken together, support a stimulatory role for 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors on hypothalamic CRF secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the long term effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor agonist, (+-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOB), on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, DOB (0.35 mg/kg/day) was administered via osmotic minipumps to rats for 7 days at which time plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone and regional brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations were measured. In addition, anterior pituitary CRF and frontal cortical 5-HT2 receptor binding was measured. Seven-day infusion of DOB resulted in tolerance to the stimulatory actions of the drug on the HPA axis as evidenced by the return of plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations to base-line values. Moreover, rats treated chronically with DOB exhibited decreased numbers of both anterior pituitary CRF and cortical and hypothalamic 5-HT2 receptor. These receptor changes were physiologically significant as challenges doses of DOB or CRF resulted in blunted ACTH responses. Chronic DOB infusion was without effect on CRF concentrations in all hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions studied. A series of time course experiments revealed that DOB-induced increases in plasma corticosterone returned to base-line by 2-days postimplantation. This effect was apparently associated with down-regulation of the 5-HT2 receptor because high-affinity cortical [3H]DOB and hypothalamic (+-)-[125I]-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-amino-propane binding were decreased at this time as well. Although median eminence CRF content was unchanged at all time points, anterior pituitary CRF receptor binding was significantly decreased 7 days postimplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Models studied included two-kidney, one-clip hypertension, one-kidney, one-clip hypertension, desoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, and three normotensive control groups: two-kidney control, one-kidney control and salt-loaded control. Blood pressures at death were significantly higher in all three hypertensive groups compared with normotensive controls, but there were no significant differences among the hypertensive or normotensive groups. Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in all three hypertensive groups compared with respective controls, with no significant differences among hypertensive or control groups. In all three hypertensive groups, there were significant reductions in binding of aortic and mesenteric vascular alpha-1 receptors, renal tubular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, and adrenal cortical alpha-2 receptors when compared with respective control groups. Reduced binding of cardiac ventricular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors was also found in all hypertensive groups, but not to statistically significant levels. No significant differences in intestinal alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptor binding were detected in either hypertensive or normotensive groups. The results suggest increased peripheral sympathetic activity in all three models of experimental hypertension, which is associated with down-regulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors in a number of peripheral tissues, especially those that control cardiovascular hemodynamics and fluid and salt balance. There is no evidence of an increase in peripheral alpha receptor binding as has often been found in some models of genetic or spontaneous hypertension.\r"

In sections of brain mash, the kinetics of association and dissociation of [3H]MK-801 were monophasic in the presence of 100 microM glutamate and glycine, and Scatchard transformations of saturation isotherms resulted in linear plots. Inhibition of the binding of [3H]MK-801 by other noncompetitive antagonists produced competition curves with Hill coefficients close to 1.0, consistent with a simple bimolecular interaction between the radioligand and the receptor. Scatchard plots based upon densitometric measurements of [3H]MK-801 binding in serial sections of rat brain were also linear, with dissociation constant values ranging from 5.0 to 8.4 nM in different regions at the level of the hippocampus. The distribution of [3H]MK-801 binding sites paralleled the distribution of NMDA displaceable L-[3H]glutamate binding sites. One exception was the cerebellar granule cell layer, where the density of binding sites for [3H]MK-801 was extremely low. The relative density of [3H]MK-801 to NMDA displaceable L-[3H]glutamate binding sites was approximately 1 to 2, consistent with the existence of two transmitter recognition sites per NMDA receptor. The modulatory effects of polyamines on [3H]MK-801 binding were studied in washed brain sections. The polyamine agonists spermine and spermidine enhanced [3H]MK-801 binding in all regions studied, with increases ranging from 18% in the thalamus to 106% in the ventromedial striatum. The effects of spermine and spermidine in these regions were highly correlated. Diethylenetriamine, which blocks the effects of spermidine, by itself produced decreases in the binding of [3H]MK-801 in most regions ranging from 5 to 21% but increased binding in parts of the striatum by 3 to 22%. The decrease in binding produced by diethylenetriamine in different brain regions was negatively correlated with the increase in binding produced by the agonists, suggesting that variability in the residual concentration of endogenous polyamines contributes to the regional variability of agonist effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ACO2 laser in the continuous wave mode using a power density of 666 W/cm2 was fired through a 5-cm metal cylinder at virus-infected tissues. Airborne particulate debris, 100-200 microns, was removed from the cylinder's inner surfaces. In one instance, deposition of the debris was found on the surgeon's eyeglasses 1 m from the site of impact despite the use of a smoke evacuator. The first set of studies involved confirmed human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions of the human female lower genital tract. Specimens were collected for electron microscopy and Southern Blot viral hybridization. Additional cervical electron microscopy specimens were recovered from the speculum during pulsed CO2 laser treatment at 13 W average power during conization. Electron microscopy of the vulvar debris revealed only anucleate keratinized squamous epithelial cells. Cervical specimens demonstrated similar cells with nearly instantaneous vaporization of intracellular water and apparent condensation of cellular carbon. HPV Southern Blot testing revealed insufficient quantities of DNA for that technique. The second set of studies involved bovine papillomavirus lesions from dairy cattle.

HPV 16, the only HPV type detected in the lesions, was identified in about half the cases. HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women, and their lesions displayed koilocytosis more often. In four of five cases in which there was a progression to invasive cancer, HPV 16 was detected in both the VIN III and invasive cancer tissue.\r"

  ".W": "There is a discrepancy between anatomy textbooks' description of groin node position and Way's technique of lymphadenectomy. On the one hand, anatomic studies have demonstrated that the deep femoral nodes are on the medial side of the femoral vein, lying on the deep portion of the fascia lata, and can be seen easily through the opening of the fossa ovalis. On the other hand, the standard technique of deep femoral lymphadenectomy consists of removing the fat lying lateral to the femoral artery through the incision and detachment of the fascia lata from the sartorius to adductor longus muscle. With the aim of demonstrating that a correct deep femoral lymphadenectomy does not require removal of the fascia lata, we dissected Scarpa's triangles in 50 female cadavers. The examination of 100 specimens demonstrated that the deep femoral nodes are always situated within the opening of the fossa ovalis, and no lymph nodes are distal to the lower margin of the fossa ovalis, under the fascia cribrosa. These findings suggest that deep femoral lymphadenectomy can be performed without removing the fascia lata.\r"

The rationale for using this technique was based on anatomic knowledge of the topographic distribution of groin lymph nodes, which was confirmed by the study of 50 cadavers. The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books. In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature. These preliminary results suggest that the surgical technique used in this study is as radical an oncologic procedure as Way's classic groin lymphadenectomy, which consists of removing the fascia lata and cribriform fascia.\r"

This study compared TestPack Chlamydia to Chlamydiazyme for the direct detection of chlamydial antigen in endocervical specimens. One thousand three hundred seventy-six patients seen in 47 private practice offices of obstetrician-gynecologists and family practitioners were screened. TestPack Chlamydia, a 25-minute enzyme immunoassay, had a specificity of 98.6% and sensitivity of 90% when compared with Chlamydiazyme, a four-hour laboratory test. The overall prevalence of chlamydial infection in this population was 3.6%. The prevalence among patients less than or equal to 24 years of age was 7.6% higher among subgroups with symptoms and other identified risk factors. The positive predictive value of TestPack Chlamydia (83.7%) makes it an accurate assay for testing women at risk for chlamydial infections.\r"

Between July 1, 1987, and Aug 15, 1987, 322 consecutive patients underwent an anonymous urine toxicology screen at the time of admission to the labor-and-delivery unit. Patients were identified only by a consecutive number and by their age, race, marital status, gravidity, parity and obstetric service (clinic vs. private). The prevalence of positive urine toxicologic screens for marijuana was 19.9% among the study population (64 positive tests among 322 women screened). The prevalence was greater among the clinic patients than the private patients (52 of 161, or 32.3%, vs. 12 of 161, or 7.5%, respectively). The distribution of race and marital status among the marijuana-positive and -negative groups were also significantly different. Specifically, the proportions of black and single women were higher among the marijuana-positive group. Our findings suggest that marijuana use is common in our obstetric patients. The possible association between marijuana use during pregnancy and perinatal morbidity, as well as the unreliable nature of patient drug histories, may support the use of rapid, inexpensive screening techniques, especially if general screening is considered.\r"

Each subject's description of how she performed the examination was scored according to her mention of up to 10 recommended BSE techniques. A random sample of 433 women without advanced-stage breast cancer from the same population was interviewed for comparison. Relative to women not practicing BSE, the risk of advanced-stage breast cancer among BSE users was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.81). Frequency of BSE did not differ between women with advanced-stage breast cancer and control subjects, whether in all subjects or in subgroups defined by age, use of mammography, or frequency of clinical breast examinations. While self-described proficiency in BSE was generally low in both case and control subjects, the small percentage of women reporting more thorough self-examinations, regardless of frequency, had about a 35% decrease in the occurrence of advanced-stage breast cancer compared to women who did not perform BSE. These results suggest that, while carefully performed BSE may avoid the development of some advanced-stage breast cancers, BSE as practiced by most Seattle-area women is of little or no benefit.\r"

  ".W": "The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a phase II pilot study of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery in 85 eligible patients with non-small-cell cancer limited to the chest but in whom attempted resection would have been likely to leave residual disease (advanced stage IIIA and minimal stage IIIB disease). Cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 29; fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per 24 hours, was administered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 4 and on days 29 through 32; and thoracic radiation, 30 Gy in 15 fractions, was administered on days 1 through 19. Two patients achieved a complete response and 46 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 56%. Toxicity from chemoradiotherapy was moderate but acceptable. Eight weeks after therapy was initiated, 54 patients underwent thoracotomy and tumor resection was attempted: 29 (34%) had complete resection and 15 (18%) had incomplete resection. Although surgical dissection was generally more difficult than in patients not pretreated with chemoradiotherapy, there was no apparent increase in postoperative complications. In 8 patients (9%), no viable tumor was detected pathologically in the resection specimen. Of the 18 patients whose tumors were completely resected and had disease recurrence, none had recurrence only in the chest, 12 (67%) had recurrence only in distant sites, and 3 developed second primary tumors. Median survival of all patients was 13 months. The overall results do not indicate a major benefit from this preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with advanced but potentially resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. These results suggest a need to define better the relative roles of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Maternal-fetal exchange of a potent tobacco-related human carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl, was studied in smoking (n = 14) and nonsmoking (n = 38) pregnant women. N-Hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl, the active metabolite of 4-aminobiphenyl, forms chemical addition products (adducts) with hemoglobin. Levels of 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts were measured in maternal-fetal paired blood samples obtained from smoking and nonsmoking women during labor and delivery. Carcinogen-hemoglobin adducts were detected in all maternal and fetal blood samples. Levels of such adducts were significantly higher (P less than .001) in maternal and fetal blood samples from smokers: the mean 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct level was 92 +/- 54 pg/g of hemoglobin in blood samples from fetuses of smokers, and 17 +/- 13 pg/g of hemoglobin in blood samples from fetuses of nonsmokers; the mean maternal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct level was 183 +/- 108 pg/g of hemoglobin in smokers, and 22 +/- 8 pg/g of hemoglobin in nonsmokers. Fetal carcinogen-adduct levels were consistently lower than maternal levels: the mean maternal to fetal ratio was 2.4 +/- 1.1 in smokers and 1.9 +/- .98 in nonsmokers. Fetal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels were strongly associated (correlation coefficient [r2] = .51, P = .002) with maternal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels when paired samples from smoking mothers were analyzed. A measure of third-trimester tobacco smoke exposure based on number of cigarettes smoked per day, amount of each cigarette smoked, and depth of inhalation was associated (r2 = .59, P = .029) with maternal 4-aminobiphenyl levels but not with fetal 4-aminobiphenyl levels. This study demonstrates that a potent tobacco-related carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl, or its active metabolite, N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl, crosses the human placenta and binds to fetal hemoglobin in concentrations that are significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers.\r"

Expression of nm23 has been detected in human breast tumors by means of hybridization and immunocytochemistry. We measured nm23 mRNA in 71 patients with primary breast cancer and found variable levels of nm23 expression. The nm23 gene was expressed at higher levels in well-differentiated tumors (P less than .02). There was a significant inverse relationship between nm23 expression and nodal status (P less than .02). Expression of nm23 was positively associated with longer disease-free survival and overall survival, and the relationships were significant (P less than .002 and P less than .003, respectively). This study showed that nm23 expression in human breast cancer was associated with good prognosis and a lack of lymph node metastasis and suggests that the nm23 gene product may play an important role in suppressing the metastatic phenotype.\r"

Thirty-six sites of metastases were present in the 30 study patients, and the median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 3 (range, 1 to 4). All patients had failed to respond to primary combined methotrexate/cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Nine (30%; confidence interval, 15% to 47%) of the patients achieved a partial response. The mean duration of response was more than 5.2 months (median, 6 months; range, 3 to 8 months). Two patients who achieved a partial response of 5 and 7 months' duration, respectively, had control of residual disease (one with radiation and one with surgical excision) and have remained disease-free for an additional period of more than 7 and 13 months, respectively. These data suggest that the combination of 5-FU and recombinant human interferon alfa-2a is synergistic, with clinical significance for the treatment of urothelial tumors. The response rate for this combination of drugs is higher than that anticipated for either of these agents used alone. Additional confirmatory trials are needed to evaluate the significance of these findings.\r"

We report here that this drug is a potent inhibitor of cell replication and, like taxol, promotes the in vitro assembly of stable microtubules in the absence of guanosine triphosphate and induces microtubule-bundle formation in cells. Compared with taxol, RP 56976 is slightly more active as a promoter of tubulin polymerization. As an inhibitor of cell replication, RP 56976 is 2.5-fold more potent than taxol in J774.2 and P388 cells and at least 5-fold more potent in taxol-resistant cells.\r"

Young swine (15-25 kg) were anesthetized, cannulated, and ventilated (5 cm H2O PEEP, 0.5 FIO2, and 15 cc/kg tidal volume). Three groups were studied: septic animals (Ps, n = 10) received Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 1 hr IV, controls (C, n = 9) received 0.9% NaCl, and ibuprofen-treated septic animals (Ps + Ibu, n = 7) received ibuprofen 12.5 mg/kg at 0 and 120 min post Ps. Systemic (SAP) and pulmonary (PAP) arterial pressures, PaO2, cardiac index (CI), static lung compliance (CL), EVLW (thermal cardiogreen), and peripheral white blood cell counts (WBC) were measured. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed for protein and % neutrophil (%PMN) content. Results: Ps produced significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in CL, PaO2, SAP, CI, and peripheral WBC and increases in PAP, EVLW, BAL protein, and %PMN's vs. controls. Ibu prevented the early increase in PAP and attenuated the late increase in PAP and EVLW. Ibu also maintained PaO2, CL, BAL protein, and %PMN's in BAL at control levels, but exhibited no significant effect on peripheral leukopenia. These data strongly suggest that ibuprofen administered before and at 120 min after onset of Pseudomonas infusion improves lung compliance and affects neutrophil function sufficiently to significantly ameliorate many of the physiologic derangements in acute sepsis.\r"

From 1979 to 1989, more than 20,000 patients were admitted to a Level I trauma center. A retrospective review identified 59 patients requiring emergency surgery for this condition. Injuries resulted from vehicular accidents (68%), motorcycle crashes (10%), pedestrians being struck by vehicles (7%), falls (5%), crushing (7%), and being struck by a horse (2%) or crane (2%). Seventeen patients (29%) had isolated rupture of the pericardium; 37 (63%) had ruptures of one or more cardiac chambers. All patients had signs of life at the scene or during transportation, but only 29 (49%) had vital signs on admission: 15 with chamber injury, 12 with pericardial rupture, and two with combined injuries. Diagnosis was established by emergency thoracotomy in the 30 patients who arrived in cardiac arrest. In the remaining 29 patients, diagnosis was made by urgent thoracotomy (41%), by subxiphoid pericardial window (34%), during laparotomy (21%), or by chest radiography (3%). The overall mortality rate was 76% (45 patients), but only 52% for those with vital signs on admission. Rapid transportation and expeditious surgical treatment can save many patients with these injuries.\r"

  ".W": "The amount of surfactant present in the intra-alveolar space is mainly regulated by the synthesis and recycling of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Biochemical analyses have shown that the surfactant level is frequently diminished and that protein-rich exudate can further interfere with surfactant function in the lungs of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. The microenvironmental changes that occur in the alveoli of burned patients, who are prone to developing ARDS, are unclear. Therefore, using an in vitro rat lung organotypic culture, we showed that the sera of rats with a 3-day old, third-degree thermal injury (25-30% total body surface area) inhibited surfactant synthesis in organotypically cultured rat lung cells. Surfactant precursor, 3H-choline, incorporation into the surfactant was 58% of control. Using liposomes made of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol (8:1, v/v) or surfactant we showed that surfactant endocytosis by purified type II alveolar cells is an active, temperature-dependent process, and correlates with the quantity of surfactant present in the milieu. We also found that plasma protein-rich fluid interfered with surfactant endocytosis by the purified type II pneumocytes. These two processes of inhibition of surfactant synthesis and its reutilization by these cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS.\r"

Sheep were subjected to a freeze injury of one cerebral hemisphere as well as 2 hours of hypotension at a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg. Resuscitation was then carried out (MAP = 80 mm Hg) for 1 hour with either lactated Ringer's (LR, n = 6) or 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS, n = 6). Hemodynamic parameters and intracranial pressure (ICP) were followed. At the end of resuscitation brain water content was determined in injured and uninjured hemispheres. No differences were detected in cardiovascular parameters; however, ICPs were lower in animals resuscitated with HS (4.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) compared to LR (15.2 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Additionally, brain water content (ml H2O/gm dry weight) in uninjured brain hemispheres was lower after HS resuscitation (HS = 3.3 +/- 0.1; LR = 4.0 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.05). No differences were detected in the injured hemispheres. We conclude that hypertonic saline abolishes increases in ICP seen during resuscitation in a model combining hemorrhagic shock with brain injury by dehydrating areas where the blood-brain barrier is still intact. Hypertonic saline may prove useful in the early management of multiple trauma patients.\r"

Due to the similarity of the porcine immune system to man we chose the pig to study subsets of peripheral mononuclear cells after splenectomy and resistance to experimental Pneumococcal infection after splenic surgery and specific immunization. Female miniature pigs were assigned to four operative groups: sham operation, splenectomy, splenic resection, and heterotopic splenic autotransplantation. Hematologic and flow cytometric analysis of mononuclear cells and their subsets revealed a marked leukocytosis following splenectomy and autotransplantation but no significant shift in monocyte and B-cell numbers. Response of leukocytes to septicemia, bacterial elimination from peripheral blood, and mortality were not affected by splenectomy or spleen-preserving operations. Mortality of splenectomized animals was 18%, compared to 42% in sham-operated controls (difference not significant). Immunization protected animals from development of leukopenia, and led to an enhanced bacterial elimination, and a significantly decreased mortality of 5%, compared to 48% in nonimmune animals. Thus our data do not show significant effects of splenectomy on subsets of porcine mononuclear cells or on resistance to experimental Pneumococcal septicemia.\r"

Each patient was assigned Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS). Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and Trauma Score (TS). The total number of patients classified as severe was 65 (21%), and 13 were classified as non-salvageable, with seven non-salvageable survivors and six non-preventable deaths. Our study suggests that current trauma scoring systems tend to overestimate the non-salvageable population. Those identified as non-salvageable and who survived have a high probability of meaningful functional recovery. Current trauma scoring systems are in need of revision to better identify non-salvageable survivors and those children who will not make a meaningful neurologic recovery.\r"

Thirty purebred beagle dogs were divided into three groups and subjected to sham operation (Group 1), splenectomy (Group 2), and splenic wrap (Group 3). Immunologic studies showed no difference between the wrapped group (Group 3) and those with their spleens intact (Group 1) in the induction of specific antibody-producing lymphocytes in splenic tissue after the injection of attenuated Pneumococci. All splenic injuries treated at Cook County Hospital between January 1985 and May 1988 were retrospectively analyzed. Of 60 patients with splenic injuries, 14 underwent mesh splenorrhaphy without mortality or serious complications. This study demonstrates that the immune function of spleen is preserved following mesh splenorrhapy, and that this technique can be used in a clinical setting with safe and efficacious results.\r"

All insertion points deviating from the original anatomic landmarks did not accomplish biomechanical requirements. A femoral displacement had an increased effect on disturbing isometry compared to a tibial malposition. Although recommended by several authors, the \"over-the-top\" position gave the most unsatisfactory results with a maximum isometry failure of 10 mm. In cruciate ligament replacement a positioning guide with isometry testing capacity should be mandatory to ensure correct placement of bone tunnels. For this purpose a new positioning device which allows for isometry measurements before a bone channel is drilled is introduced and applied in an experimental setup.\r"

To assess the flexibility of shoulder and elbow joints 24 parameters were measured on each body side using the neutral-zero method of Debrunner.

Proper timing and careful preoperative planning are essential to prevent soft-tissue complications. In a total of 16 fractures good clinical and radiologic results were achieved in 50% of the cases; results were satisfactory in 25% and poor in 25%. The patients returned to work after an average of 5 months. Only three patients (19%) received disability compensations, which compares favorably with nonoperative treatment. We believe that a majority of comminuted intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus profit from open reduction and internal fixation and that more reliable functional results are achieved than with conservative therapy.\r"

The spontaneous and cytokine (IL-4, IL-2)-induced expression of CD23 which represents a B-cell activation marker was significantly reduced during the second to fifth week postburn when compared to healthy donors. In contrast, CD25, which is expressed on activated T cells, showed a marked increase both spontaneously, indicating an in vivo activation, and after stimulation with IL-2 or PHA. Concomitantly, T-cell proliferation induced by PHA or Con A was suppressed. However, the number of T and B cells remained unchanged. The data demonstrate the impairment of early events in the lymphocyte program in severely burned patients. The activation of B cells is downregulated, since they become refractory to external helper signals. In addition, T cells are highly activated but fail to proceed to proliferation in response to mitogenic stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "The value of sonography in acute trauma evaluation is generally underestimated, and the opinions are controversial. Sonography was performed as a primary screening procedure in 400 of 750 mass casualty patients with trauma admitted to a large hospital within the first 72 hours after the 1988 Armenian earthquake. Two real-time sector scanners were used in the reception area of the hospital, and the average time spent on one patient was 4 minutes. More than 130 followup sonographic examinations were required. Trauma-associated pathology of the abdomen and retroperitoneal space was detected in 12.8% of the patients, with 1% false negatives and no false positives. The authors believe that sonographic screening of mass casualties is a quick and effective means for detection of abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries. Sonography should be used for this purpose more routinely to gain experience and maintain preparedness of the sonographers for screening of trauma cases in mass casualty situations.\r"

Since traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) is a rapidly lethal condition, unnecessary CT scanning may not be justified. To determine the accuracy of chest CT scanning for TAR, we reviewed 17 patients who underwent both chest CT scanning and aortography. Five patients had TAR by aortography. CT scanning yielded three true positives and two false negatives. In 12 patients with a negative aortogram, CT scanning recorded four false positives and eight true negatives. The specificity was 23% and the sensitivity was 83% compared with aortography. The overall accuracy for CT scanning was 53%. From these data we conclude that in the presence of an unstable patient or where there is a strong clinical suspicion of TAR the patient should proceed directly to aortography.\r"

Taking into account the eventual late symptoms, the most severe delayed diagnoses were of injuries located around the hip and knee joints. The patients with delayed diagnoses were, on the average, the most severely ill: their needs for primary blood transfusions and assisted respiration resembled the needs of patients who later died of their trauma or its complications. The most common causes of the delay in diagnosis were: radiographs not done in 60% of patients, and no notation of visible injury in radiographs in 31%. Inferior quality of radiographs, unnoticed radiologists' reports, a fracture visible at the outermost corner of a radiograph, a fracture hidden by other fractures, or excessive obesity of the patient may also contribute to a delay. The study presents measures for improving diagnostic strategies, but it would appear that delayed diagnoses cannot be totally eradicated.\r"

Compared to employees reporting no recent cocaine use, the cocaine users were younger, less often married and reported heavier drinking and more alcohol-related problems, on the job and off. Even after controlling for demographic and occupational factors, and drinking indicators, cocaine users reported more binges (being drunk 24 hours or more), more blackouts (marginally significant, p = .06), more absenteeism and more warnings about unacceptable job performance. Alcoholic EAP clients who use cocaine appear to engage in riskier drinking and to have more trouble on the job than do those who report no cocaine use, and this seems to be a difference specifically attributable to their use of cocaine.\r"

The two groups did not differ in terms of age, education or the ratio of men to women. There were significant differences in coping styles and personality characteristics between alcoholics and nonalcoholics and, to a large extent, between men and women within the alcoholic group. Practically no significant differences were found between the men in the two groups, but female alcoholics differed greatly from nonalcoholic women in terms of coping styles, personality variables and also in terms of conflict. These findings indicate that the differences between alcoholic and nonalcoholics in the sample were due largely to patterns uniquely characterizing the female alcoholic group.

An unweighted cut-off score of two or greater produced a sensitivity of .72 and a specificity of .64. The results of this study suggest that, when the SMAST is used for screening in an ambulatory care clinic population, the optimum balance of sensitivity and specificity is achieved using an unweighted cut-off score of two or greater.

Ninety-eight subjects (38.4% of sample) were readmitted for alcoholism-related diagnoses within 15 months of discharge. Patients with a long history of heavy drinking, high daily alcohol consumption and history of previous alcoholism treatment were most likely to be readmitted with an alcoholism-related primary diagnosis. Once these variables were controlled for, other major psychiatric disorders, polysubstances abuse and sociodemographic variables did not appear to predict time to readmission. However, other potentially more sensitive outcome measures such as return to drinking were not evaluated in the present study.\r"
