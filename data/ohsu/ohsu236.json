Disseminated coccidioidomycosis developed in a 23-year-old man soon after undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Clinical manifestations included an unusual rash, severe myositis and arthropathy, a rapid downhill course, and pathologic evidence of widespread fungal invasion, including invasion of the cardiac graft. Detailed travel and geographic histories, and perhaps skin testing and antibody determinations for geographic-specific pathogens, should be part of the preoperative evaluation of all transplant candidates.\r"

First, the simultaneous occurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis and sarcoidosis has been documented in a few patients. Second, some of these patients had an overlap syndrome characterized by features of both disorders, inviting speculation regarding a common pathogenesis. Third, in patients with sarcoidosis, advanced cholestatic sarcoid liver disease may develop, which may cause diagnostic confusion with primary biliary cirrhosis. Finally, patients with primary biliary cirrhosis may have pulmonary fibrosis as an associated disease.\r"

Retrospective assessment of the biparietal diameter, femur length, and biparietal diameter/femur length ratio in 55 fetuses with Down syndrome and 544 control fetuses was performed at two medical centers. Adequate numbers of cases and controls were available to permit statistically significant comparisons between the groups at 15 to 23 weeks' gestation. Fetuses with Down syndrome displayed no statistically significant differences in the cephalic index or the biparietal diameter compared with controls at a given gestational age. Significant femur length shortening was observed, but the greatest statistical difference was noted for the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio. This ratio was found to decrease with gestational age in the normal population and was consistently elevated in the Down syndrome population (compared with control) throughout the second trimester. With a cutoff value of 1.5 SD above the normal population mean for the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio, 50% to 70% of fetuses with Down syndrome could be identified in 6% of the total population (p less than 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests that the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio may prove superior to current Down syndrome screening methods and, as a third independent variable, may significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of combined maternal age/maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening modalities.\r"

Screening errors for black women can result from the use of normative data bases established with maternal serum samples drawn from other racial groups or the use of such data bases in conjunction with a published correction factor. Because the incidence of open neural tube defects is lower for blacks than for others, excessive false positive results for blacks (estimated to be 8817 to 28,215 cases annually) would be a pernicious misapplication of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening. We address the problem outlined above and recommend independently developed, valid, normative data bases.\r"

In this study, alpha-fetoprotein was obtained from the fluid of 1060 women undergoing genetic amniocentesis for advanced maternal age. Poor pregnancy outcome was defined as (1) a fetal or neonatal death, (2) preterm delivery, or (3) low birth weight infants. Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein was compared to each type of adverse outcome. No significant association with a poor pregnancy outcome in later gestation was noted. Although serum alpha-fetoprotein in the midtrimester of pregnancy may relate to certain poor outcomes in later gestation, midtrimester amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein offers no predictive value for the course of events in later gestation.\r"

The purpose of this report is to describe our experience with 489 pregnant women who came between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 1985 to our Antepartum Fetal Surveillance Clinic with this complaint alone or in association with another indication for fetal surveillance. Overall, 838 nonstress tests were performed, and the results were reactive, 93.2%; nonreactive, 6.8%; and fetal heart rate decelerations, 6.1%. Comparison of the first nonstress test results between those with decreased fetal movement alone or in combination with another diagnosis demonstrated a similar incidence of nonreactivity and fetal heart rate decelerations. In those patients whose indication was decreased fetal movement alone, there was a 3.7 times greater likelihood of diminished amniotic fluid volume. When the last test within 7 days of delivery was analyzed, the decreased fetal movement alone group had a lower incidence of cesarean delivery, cesarean delivery for fetal distress, and Apgar scores less than 7 than patients with an additional indication for testing. In summary, decreased fetal movement continues to be an acceptable indication for fetal surveillance. Based on our retrospective experience, the most reasonable approach appears to be a combination of nonstress test and amniotic fluid volume assessment. Unless the patient has additional indications for fetal surveillance, the patient with decreased fetal movement with a reactive nonstress test and a normal amniotic fluid volume does not appear to warrant additional testing.\r"

  ".W": "The maternal and fetal metabolic effects of three commonly used intravenous fluids administered before regional anesthesia were studied in 32 gravid women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Patients were randomized into one of three groups to receive 1 L of either 5% dextrose (50 gm of glucose) or Ringer's lactate or isotonic saline solution before epidural anesthesia. Acute glucose infusion resulted in maternal hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and an increase in the blood lactate level. Cord blood glucose, insulin, and lactate levels were also increased in this group. The key finding of this study was the significant lowering of pH in the umbilical cord vein (7.31 +/- 0.04) and artery (7.21 +/- 0.06) in the glucose-infused group when compared with the non-glucose infusion groups (p less than 0.05). Confounding perinatal factors such as maternal position, maternal hypotension, and prolonged time of surgery did not influence the fetal acid-base status. Thus acute maternal glucose infusion in normal patients can cause fetal hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and neonatal hypoglycemia. These findings may be of particular clinical importance when fetal distress or fetal hypoxemia is due to other perinatal events. Under these circumstances, acute maternal glucose infusion may further contribute to fetal metabolic acidosis.\r"

Fetal movement makes these procedures technically more difficult while increasing the risk of fetal injury. However, maternal sedation rarely results in adequate suppression of fetal activity. Thus we tested the sedative effects of intramuscular d-tubocurarine (3 or 1.5 mg/kg) or pancuronium bromide (0.3 mg/kg) injected into the fetal gluteal region under ultrasound guidance in conjunction with 70 invasive in utero procedures. Short-term paralysis of the fetus was induced in all cases. No deleterious effects of this technique were noted on initial examination of the neonates. Neuromuscular blockade was found to be a very useful adjunct to both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involving the fetus.\r"

A well-characterized specific monoclonal antihuman estrogen receptor antibody (H222 sp gamma) as amplified by peroxidase/antiperoxidase techniques was used for immunohistologic localization. Immunohistochemical evaluation incorporated both the intensity and distribution of staining into a semiquantitative analysis (HSCORE). The total HSCORE was the sum of the relative contributions of the four histologic components: benign epithelium, malignant epithelium, stroma, and myometrium. These results were compared with clinicopathologic features of the tumors. Excellent sensitivity (91.5%) and specificity (93.1%) were observed for immunohistochemical analyses as compared with the biochemical analysis of estrogen receptor for these tissues. The cancer component HSCORE correlated better with grade than did the biochemical estrogen receptor determination. Correlation was also observed between surgical stage and estrogen receptor content. Decreasing biochemical estrogen receptor content predicted advanced surgical stage (p = 0.0003), as did the total HSCORE (p = 0.003); however, the HSCORE of the cancer component only did not correlate with advanced surgical stage (p = 0.11). Although immunohistochemical analyses predicted biologic differentiation better than did the biochemical technique, stage correlated better with biochemical estrogen receptor analysis and total HSCORE than did the cancer component HSCORE. The HSCORE of the cancer component may better predict biologic behavior and therefore identify cancers more likely to respond to hormonal therapy.\r"

The symptoms of dysmenorrhea, backache, and headache were significantly reduced only during active drug periods. The number of days of flow and pads or tampons used was also reduced during drug cycles but not during placebo cycles. Overall, 26 of the 29 patients evaluated had a reduction in menstrual blood loss with the use of meclofenamate sodium.

This review of the literature and our own data indicate that use of high-dose, progestogen-dominant OCs induces a potentially atherogenic lipoprotein profile (high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio), mostly attributable to the antiestrogenic action of the progestogen content of these OCs. In contrast, lower-dose combination OCs with reduced amounts of progestogens and slight estrogen dominance, either monophasic or multiphasic, produce strikingly fewer adverse effects on lipoproteins. Moreover, use of low-dose, as opposed to high-dose, OCs results in almost unchanged glucose tolerance, marginally increased or unchanged insulin and glucagon responses to glucose, and probably unchanged levels and activity of peripheral insulin receptors. Further in-depth studies of low-dose OC formulations are mandatory to ascertain reduced metabolic risk of these OCs.\r"

The first study was aimed at confirming gossypol's antifertility efficacy and determining the existence of side effects. The objective of the latter study was to find out whether the addition of a potassium salt supplement or a potassium-sparing agent could alleviate the side effect of hypokalemia. In both studies, the participants took a gossypol pill, 20 mg/day for 60 to 75 days for loading, and 50 mg/wk for maintenance. All participants were followed up for a year. The antifertility efficacy was found to be more than 90%, and the chief side effect was lowered serum potassium. In our 1983 to 1985 study, we concluded that since neither potassium supplementation nor triamterene solved the problem, it is very likely that gossypol is a nephrotoxic agent. With 1 year of gossypol treatment, serum testosterone and serum luteinizing hormone showed no change, whereas serum follicle-stimulating hormone showed some elevation after 6 months. The Shanghai researchers found that in their gossypol users, plasma and urinary beta 2-microglobulin levels were elevated to a certain extent. However, 25 subjects in our 1983 to 1985 study showed no appreciable change. Our volunteers had stopped taking gossypol for more than 1 year. In 1986 we started a third study, which was aimed at finding the lowest antifertility dose to minimize possible renal toxicity.\r"

The reliability of natural family planning depends on identifying this window of fertility without ambiguity. Several symptomatic markers, cervical mucus and basal body temperature, have been used extensively and with considerable success in most women but failures occur. Ovarian and pituitary hormone production show characteristic patterns during the cycle. Urinary estrogen and pregnanediol measurements yield reliable information concerning the beginning, peak, and end of the fertile period, provided that the assays are accurate and performed on timed specimens of urine. We have developed such enzyme immunoassays for urinary estrogen and pregnanediol glucuronides that can be performed at home. In the early versions of the assays, enzyme reaction rates were measured by eye, but more recently, a simple photoelectronic rate meter has been used. The final problem to be solved is not technologic but whether women are sufficiently motivated to expend the same time and effort each day for 10 days a month, with less cost, on fertility awareness as they spend on making a cup of tea.\r"

  ".W": "Renal tissue obtained from 8 patients with reflux nephropathy was studied by immunofluorescence with well-defined mono- and polyclonal antibodies to extracellular matrix, intermediate filament proteins, membrane attack complex of complement (MAC), and immune cells. In both unscarred and scarred areas of the tissue, intrinsic components of the human glomeruli, such as Type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, accumulated in the expanded mesangium of the glomeruli. Those components were diminished or absent in the hyalinized glomeruli. Type III collagen was occasionally localized to the mesangium and synechiae in the glomeruli and was frequently observed within the nearly hyalinized glomeruli. MAC was co-deposited with C3, C5, C9, and properdin in the sclerotic area of the glomeruli, along with a decrease in the reactivity of podocytes with anti-vimentin antibody. Numerous suppressor/cytotoxic T cells were identified in the glomeruli and widened interstitum. Monocytes/macrophages also infiltrated the glomeruli. The present study suggests that accumulation of extracellular matrix, activation of the complement system, and infiltration of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells and monocytes/macrophages are closely associated with the glomerular obsolescence and the progression of reflux nephropathy.\r"

They controlled their analysis by studying cell lines derived from chemically induced hepatomas. Transcripts from all three genes were elevated in all tumors, but not in the livers from which they arose. The transcript elevations may represent an effect of active cell proliferation in the tumors. Clone HiHi-3, derived from the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus, detected a large number of hybridization bands, most of which were not part of the rasK-p21 gene. Most tumors had an altered band at 2.6 kb; some had other altered bands. No alterations were seen in liver DNA, and none of the cell lines showed the 2.6 kb band. At low stringency, a rasH probe, which contains a short segment of a similar viral sequence, also detected altered bands in tumors and a single treated liver. These changes in endogenous viral sequences of the rat genome appear to be characteristic of carcinogenesis by a choline-devoid diet.\r"

  ".W": "A major hypothesis to explain the immunodeficiency associated with bone marrow transplantation states that thymic epithelial damage due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) abrogates or delays the recovery of normal immunologic function. This study evaluated the thymus glands of 36 human bone marrow transplant recipients dying between 4 and 1742 days after transplant using histology, histochemistry, and immunohistology. The observations lead to a model of thymic damage by irradiation, chemotherapy, and GVHD in which early injury by all three of these agents results in profound thymic atrophy followed by long-delayed restitution. Patients undergoing total body irradiation showed more severe damage to thymic cortical and medullary epithelium than did patients undergoing chemotherapy alone as preparation for transplantation. Patients with GVHD showed additional damage in the form of individual thymic epithelial cell death and showed HLA-DR surface protein expression on thymic epithelium during GVHD. Longer-term survivors showed a profoundly delayed restitution of normal thymic epithelium and delayed evidence of restored lymphopoiesis. A few patients dying late after transplant showed evidence of reconstitution of normal thymic structure or nodules of lymphopoiesis in focal areas of epithelial-cell reconstitution. Evidence of such lymphopoiesis was seen at times ranging between 90 and 1742 days after grafting. The data are consistent with a model of long-standing thymic damage caused by GVHD which is reversible after the development of tolerance.\r"

Control and 45-, 75-, or 90-minute anoxic hearts were exposed to hypotonic (200 mOsm/l) perfusion media to induce osmotic swelling. Anoxic hearts, but not control hearts, released myoglobin when subjected to osmotic swelling. Control hearts, exposed to hypotonic swelling, retained an intact cytoskeletal system of intermediate filaments, microfilaments and microtubules, intact sarcoplasmic reticulum, and intact sarcolemmal membranes. In contrast, swollen anoxic hearts showed a variety of ultrastructural lesions, including formation of large subsarcolemmal blebs associated with lysis of lateral Z-, M-, and A-band intermediate filament attachments, vesiculation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and rupture of sarcolemmal membranes. Inter-mediate filament attachments with nuclear membranes were also broken, and microtubules disappeared from the perinuclear space. Sarcomere changes included distortion of Z bands, loss of lateral Z band-sarcolemmal attachments, and separations of myofibrils from internal faces in intercalated disks. Immunofluorescence studies of control hearts showed normal staining patterns for the cytoskeletal-associated proteins vinculin, alpha-actinin, and desmin. After 90 minutes of anoxia, hearts exhibited diminished staining of vinculin and alpha-actinin and relatively little change in desmin staining. The results demonstrate that a critical period of anoxia causes lesions in the cytoskeletal apparatus of myocardial cells which correlate with the increased osmotic fragility of irreversibly injured anoxic myocardial cells.\r"

  ".U": "88047092\r", 
  ".W": "Wilms' tumor has been proposed to originate from a developmental abnormality of the metanephric blastema. This undifferentiated component of Wilms' tumors has previously eluded efforts for in vitro growth. Blastema from a \"classical\" Wilms' tumor was transplanted into nude mice and passaged through 12 generations of heterotransplantation. Tumors from heterotransplants were grown for 12 serial passages in a serum-free growth medium supplemented with hormones and conditioned media from human kidney proximal tubule cells. The blastema initially grew on a collagen-fetal calf serum matrix as multicellular spheroids, and the cells proliferating from the rim of the spheroids had a flattened shape. Pulse-labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) identified the proliferating cell population as blastemal in origin. Except for a loss of extracellular matrix, ultrastructural studies demonstrated morphologic similarities in the cultured cells, compared with the primary tumor and heterotransplants. Lectin histochemical stains for the peanut lectin (PNA) and immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin (CYTO), vimentin (VIM), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were performed on the original tumor, successive heterotransplants, and cells grown in vitro. The PNA stained the surface of the blastemal cells after sialidase digestion in the original tumor, heterotransplants, and cultured cells. The blastema of the original tumors was negative for CYTO and EMA but reactive for vimentin. This lack of differentiation was maintained in heterotransplants through 12 passages. However, blastemal cells demonstrated coexpression of CYTO and VIM intermediate filaments when grown in a serum-free medium on a matrix material. These studies demonstrate that the blastemal component of Wilms' tumor can be successfully grown in culture, passaged in nude mouse heterotransplants, and shown to undergo early stages of blastemal differentiation in vitro by growth in serum-free medium. This in vitro system provides a model for testing the factors that influence the growth and differentiation of the blastemal component of Wilms' tumors.\r"

Immunoreactive thrombospondin is also present within the normal human renal mesangium. To determine whether this thrombospondin could be a synthetic product of the intrinsic glomerular mesangial cells, we examined cultured human glomerular mesangial cells for the ability to synthesize and secrete thrombospondin. Well-characterized human mesangial cells were found to synthesize and secrete thrombospondin, as determined by specific immunostaining at the light- and electron-microscopic levels. Furthermore, metabolically labeled thrombospondin was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium of cultured cells. These studies suggest that the thrombospondin present within the normal mesangium is of intrinsic glomerular cell origin. Mesangial thrombospondin may be an important mediator of cellular function, particularly in disease states characterized by intrinsic glomerular cell proliferation.\r"

Patients most likely to switch into mania during antidepressant therapy have probably been excluded from maintenance treatment studies and are probably overrepresented in studies at special research facilities. On balance, the available evidence suggests that some bipolar patients become manic, and a few experience rapid cycling, when they are treated with antidepressants. The prevention of these responses will require further research on risk factors and on the antimanic efficacy of coadministered lithium or other mood stabilizers.\r"

Other etiologic factors, such as gallstones, alcoholism, and corticosteroids, played a minor role in this patient population.

A square knot is satisfactory, but because of its configuration it is difficult to tie, and in actual practice it is seldom used. Instead, a series of half hitches is tied. A half-hitch knot is as secure as a square knot and much easier to tie. However, it too must be tied in proper configuration to be reliable. The technique for tying a half-hitch knot and some of its characteristics are described.\r"

Of those alcoholics who become long term, active AA members, about 40 to 50% enjoy several years of total abstinence, with about 60 to 68% improving to some extent, drinking less or not at all during their participation. Those who combine AA with other forms of treatment seem to do as well as or better than those who go to AA alone. More active AA participants do as well as or better than those who participate less actively. Compared to professionally treated alcoholics, AA members seem to achieve abstinence at a higher rate. Consideration is given to the apparent unsuitability of AA for problem drinkers who choose the goal of nonproblem drinking.\r"

The SH program was staffed by only half as many primary therapists as the control. Patients in both programs were evaluated over the course of one year. By means of the Patient Status Form, a clinical assessment instrument applied monthly, SH patients were found to score significantly higher on social adjustment, although retention and drinking rates, and utilization of Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram were no different from controls. This study is the continuation of an initial comparison in which SH patients were found to have enhanced retention in treatment after discharge from an impatient service.\r"

The present investigation was therefore designed to directly examine the effects of zimeldine on food intake. The results indicated that zimeldine had a potent anorexic action. Furthermore, the drug appeared to primarily affect food intake, with secondary decreases in the fluid most closely associated with prandial drinking. The results were discussed in terms of the effects of serotonin uptake blockade on motivational processes in general.\r"

The blood alcohol concentration was not influenced significantly by dichloromethane. The single high dose of ethanol completely inhibited the carboxyhemoglobin concentration increase due to dichloromethane, but did not prevent the dichloromethane-induced decrease of nerve conduction velocity. It produced initially lower, then higher concentrations of dichloromethane in blood than values seen after administration of dichloromethane per se. Rats treated with ethanol plus dichloromethane showed a more pronounced decrease of nerve conduction velocity compared with rats administered dichloromethane only.\r"

They constitute a set of main transferrin forms in serum of healthy individuals. Their relative proportions are changed in serum from alcoholic individuals, where the more basic of these forms are increased. Tryptic peptides of all forms were compared by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) patterns (fingerprint analysis). Two major differences were detected between corresponding tryptic peptides of the five transferrin forms. Some minor differences were also noticed. The corresponding peptides were purified from the main form and analyzed for total composition and amino acid sequence. The peptides with the major differences between the forms were found to be the two with the glycosylation attachment at positions 413 and 611. A minor peptide difference between the transferrin forms contains a product that is explained by incomplete stoichiometry in cleavage of the peptide bond at positions 217-218. Successive loss of sialic acid is compatible with the presence of different transferrin forms, and our results indicate that the main differences between the serum transferrin forms from healthy and alcoholic individuals are in successive changes of the carbohydrate chains attached at positions 413 and 611.\r"

In the present investigation, a correlation was found between calcium-induced changes in behavioral sensitivity and in the sensitivity of cerebellar Purkinje neurons to the depressant effects of locally applied ethanol. Cerebellar Purkinje neuron sensitivity was measured as the dose of ethanol pressure ejected from a multibarreled micropipette required to produce a 50% depression of spontaneous firing rate of single neurons. Administration of 0.2-0.4 mumol calcium chloride into the lateral ventricle of the brain increased the sensitivity of SS but not LS mice to the hypnotic behavioral effect of systemically administered ethanol. Similarly, Purkinje neuron sensitivity to locally applied ethanol was also enhanced in SS but not in LS mice 15 min following administration of calcium (0.25 mumol) icv. Furthermore, locally applied ethanol was more effective in depressing spontaneous Purkinje neuron discharge in SS mice when a 1 mM calcium solution was concomitantly pressure ejected with ethanol from the micropipette. Magnesium chloride did not mimic the effects of calcium on either behavioral or electrophysiological effects of ethanol, suggesting that the action of calcium is not a nonspecific effect of divalent cations. These data suggest that calcium-dependent processes may be involved in behavioral and electrophysiological effects associated with ethanol intoxication. Further research will be required to determine if the genetically selected difference in ethanol sensitivity expressed in LS and SS mice is regulated by calcium mechanisms.\r"

The main objective of this study was to carry out a detailed assessment of MAO function that included the measurement of key kinetic parameters (i.e., Km, Vmax) in three groups of male subjects: (a) 51 hospitalized chronic alcoholics, (b) 16 recovering alcoholics with 2-10 years of abstinence, and (c) 21 controls. MAO activity was assayed radiochemically with [14C]tyramine as substrate (43-729 microM). The present study demonstrated that alcoholics had low platelet MAO activity (p less than 0.05). Kinetic analysis revealed a substantial reduction (p less than 0.01) in enzyme Vmax values of chronic and recovering alcoholics. Greater than 95% of the alcoholics had Vmax values lower than the smallest value of control subjects. Moreover, 100% of the alcoholics in both groups exhibited exceedingly low Vmax values that were below the 25th percentile of controls. In summary, results of MAO Vmax determinations provided us with a better separation of the alcoholics from controls. Measurements of platelet MAO function that include enzyme Vmax may provide us a reliable biochemical marker for alcoholism.\r"

No correlations were found between CDT level and volume density of liver fibrosis or steatosis or values of a number of clinicochemical liver tests.

The effects of alcohol on atrial fibrillation, however, have not been studied. Accordingly, measurements of hemodynamics and duration of electrically induced atrial fibrillation were made in alpha-chloralose anesthetized dogs during the 30 min before and during a 30-min intravenous infusion of 1.7 g/kg of ethanol (25%, v/v), which produced an average infusion concentration of 254 +/- 21 mg/dl. Average cardiac output, left ventricular (LV) peak dp/dt, and pulmonary artery mean pressure did not change, whereas LV systolic (116 +/- 8 to 107 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and aortic mean (95 +/- 7 to 87 +/- 9 mmHg, p less than 0.05) pressures decreased. Heart rate and atrioventricular conduction in sinus rhythm, and atrial and ventricular activity in atrial fibrillation also did not change. Despite a decrease in arterial pH, duration of atrial fibrillation decreased (356 +/- 143 to 93 +/- 38 sec, p less than 0.05). Moreover, at 15 min, when average ethanol concentration was 208 +/- 20 mg/dl, and aortic mean pressure (95 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), pulmonary artery mean pressure (16 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and LV peak dp/dt (1563 +/- 143 to 1285 +/- 167 mm Hg-sec-1, p less than 0.05) were reduced, duration of atrial fibrillation was less than control (356 +/- 143 to 114 +/- 56 sec, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By recording auditory brainstem potentials (BSP) from abstinent alcoholics we demonstrated significant delays in brainstem transmission time. We have also reported that P3 amplitudes are significantly reduced in abstinent alcoholics compared to control subjects. Although the neurophysiological deficits observed in abstinent alcoholics are presumed to be alcohol-related effects, it is possible that some of these deficits may exist prior to alcohol exposure, and may be present in subjects at high risk for alcoholism. We have recently observed significantly reduced P3 components in young sons of alcoholics similar to those observed in abstinent alcoholics. In the present study, we examined auditory BSPs in young boys at high risk for alcoholism and matched controls. We found no statistically significant difference in brainstem transmission time between high risk individuals and matched control subjects. These findings suggest that while some brain deficits observed in abstinent alcoholics may antecede the development of alcoholism (P3) and may represent a predisposing factor, other deficits (BSP) appear to be the consequence of alcohol and/or nutritional-related effects.\r"

Synaptosomes incubated in the absence of filipin were used as cytochemical controls. Biochemical determination indicates a 12% increase of cholesterol in synaptosomal membranes from alcohol treated rats. This increase was confirmed by a significant increment in the number of filipin-cholesterol complexes. Synaptosomes of treated rats showed a reduction in the total number of synaptic vesicles (SV) as well as a decrease in the density and total number of intramembranous particles (IMP) per synaptosome. In control rats, most synaptosomal IMP were distributed in clusters whereas in those of rats exposed to alcohol they were distributed at random. These changes in distribution of IMP were also observed in presynaptic terminals analyzed \"in situ.\" These findings indicate that ethanol acts on the presynaptic terminals. The variations in cholesterol content as well as in the density and distribution of IMP appear to be related to alcohol-induced changes in the physicochemical properties of components of the synaptosomal membrane.\r"

Genetic variation was found both for ataxia, as measured by loss of righting response (sleep time) after a hypnotic dose of ethanol, and for the depressant action of ethanol on the spontaneous discharge of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Results from an analysis of covariance of these phenotypes, measured among the inbred strains, provided strong evidence for a high genetic correlation between sleep time and inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje neuron discharge in response to acute ethanol administration. However, ethanol metabolism was also found to correlate with the behavioral sensitivity of rats to ethanol. Preliminary data from the third generation of replicate lines of rats currently being selectively bred for high and low acute sensitivity to ethanol shows a trend toward divergence of both ethanol sleep time and neuronal sensitivity to acute ethanol. The conclusion from these data supports the hypothesis that the cerebellum is an important locus of ethanol action, and suggests that neuronal sensitivity to ethanol will continue to diverge between these rat lines as selection for the sleep time phenotype progresses.\r"

Ethanol was more effective in reducing motor performance in Long-Evans than in Wistar rats, as determined by the tilting plane test. In addition, ethanol produced a greater reduction in the population spikes recorded from hippocampal slices (in vitro) of Long-Evans rats compared to Wistar rats. When rats from the Wistar, Long-Evans, and Sprague-Dawley strains were crossbred and then selectively outbred for high (ANT) and low (AT) sensitivity to ethanol-induced impairment of motor performance, no differences were observed in the ethanol sensitivity of the hippocampal population spike between these two strains. These data suggest that differences in ethanol sensitivity may exist among standard laboratory rodent strains. Selective outbreeding may reduce or eliminate the differences in ethanol sensitivity of brain regions or neurons other than those directly involved in producing the selected behavior. Therefore, it may be incorrect to assume a general difference in ethanol sensitivity when these traits are not coselected during outbreeding, thus indicating different neuronal pools in terms of sensitivity to ethanol.\r"

The results showed no significant differences with regard to ventilation sequence but one lung high frequency jet ventilation gave higher values than one lung conventional ventilation for shunt (p less than 0.01) and positive end expiratory pressure (p less than 0.05) and lower peak inflation pressure values (p less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, arterial carbon dioxide or available oxygen. Surgical conditions were satisfactory during both methods of ventilation and satisfactory gas exchange occurred. It was, however, more difficult to assess adequacy of ventilation during high frequency jet ventilation and the routine use of this method of ventilation is not recommended during one lung anaesthesia.\r"

Heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Cardiac index and stroke index assessed by pulsed Doppler and total vascular resistances were not altered by the caudal block. However, after caudal anesthesia, the authors observed a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in brachial blood flow assessed by pulsed Doppler (from 49.0 +/- 28.3 to 31.7 +/- 24.6 ml-1.min) and a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in brachial vascular resistance (from 2.9 +/- 1.7 to 5.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg.min.ml-1). Blood flow and vascular resistance in both the femoral and carotid arteries did not change. This study suggests that, in supine position, caudal anesthesia in infants induces a blood pooling in the denervated lower extremities and a reflex vasoconstriction in innervated areas which maintains cardiac output. We conclude that volume loading is not necessary in normovolemic infants after caudal anesthesia with cutaneous analgesia below T5.\r"

Using a randomized blind cross-over design, six mongrel dogs were given subarachnoid injections (1 ml) of the following solutions over an 8-week period: tetracaine 4 mg (control), or tetracaine 4 mg with clonidine in doses of 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 micrograms. With clonidine doses equal to or exceeding 50 micrograms/ml, motor and sensory blockade were significantly (P less than 0.01) prolonged, when compared to the control times. Analysis of data by second order polynomial regression analysis produced a relationship defined by Y = 23.241 + 1.104(x) - 0.0023(x2) with r2 = 0.92 and P less than 0.001 for sensory blockade and Y = 38.7072 + 1.64425(x) - 0.004125(x2) with r2 = 0.90 and P less than 0.005 for motor blockade. From these curves, a plateau in clonidine dose-response for both sensory blockade and motor blockade occurred at 150 micrograms. The increase in duration of spinal anesthesia with clonidine may be related to a direct post-synaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptor arteriolar effect, a spinal cord pre- or post-synaptic alpha 2 antinociceptive action or supraspinal alpha 2 modulation of nociception. No animals showed evidence of neurologic dysfunction during the study. The authors conclude that a well-defined dose-response relationship exists for clonidine in canine tetracaine spinal anesthesia.\r"

  ".U": "88047534\r", 
  ".W": "The bulk of experimental evidence indicates that anesthetics do not produce their negative inotropic effect via an inhibitory action on mitochondrial electron transport. Anesthetics decrease energy need, rather than energy production. Anesthetics also decrease the rate of sequestration of Ca2+ by mitochondria, but, again, this appears not to be an important cause of reduced myocardial contractility. The role played by direct anesthetic depression of the myofibrils in reducing contractility is uncertain. Most experimental evidence now available suggests that significant myofibrillar depression, measured in terms of inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity or inhibition of force production, occurs only at anesthetic concentrations which are high compared to concentrations employed clinically. This would seem to indicate that the myofibrils are not an important target for anesthetics in regard to the production of depressed myocardial contractility. However, the experimental act of removing myofibrils from their intracellular environment, or of removing the sarcolemma or making it hyperpermeable, appears to prevent some regulatory myofibrillar phosphorylation reactions from taking place. As stated by Winegrad, \"certain forms of regulation of the cardiac myofibril are fragile and can be seen only when cellular constituents and structure are maintained.\" It is possible that this type of regulation is susceptible to inhibition by anesthetics. Methods for preserving this regulation are available, and will need to be employed before a depressant action of anesthetics on the myofibril can be definitely dismissed as a significant cause of the inhibition of cardiac contractility. A single study, of intracellular Ca2+ levels in the intact cell (where myofibrillar regulation was presumably preserved), has indicated that halothane may decrease myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. However, for reasons stated above, this study cannot be taken as unequivocal proof of such an action. Despite the fact that the normal action potential is little affected by anesthetics, the sarcolemma appears to play a pivotal role in the production of anesthetic-induced contractile depression. Significant depression of the rate of upstroke of the slow (Ca2+-mediated) action potential by clinical concentrations of both inhalation and intravenous anesthetics has been demonstrated by several workers. This has been interpreted to mean that anesthetics inhibit the influx of Ca2+ through the slow channel, and such has been confirmed (to date, for halothane and thiamylal) by direct measurement of the slow inward Ca2+ current using a voltage clamp technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, the usefulness of the test to assess the severity of disease is limited because healthy smokers also have abnormally rapid rates of clearance. Because the stability of the 99mTc-DTPA bond might be a contributory factor, we tested the affinity of 99mTc for DTPA in vitro, and in groups of healthy smokers (n = 13) and nonsmokers (n = 7) we measured the clearances of 99mTc-DTPA and 113mIn-DTPA, which have a similar molecular shape and charge. In vitro, sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide released as much as 98% of free 99mTc from the 99mTc-DTPA complex. When incubated with human neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, between 4 and 7% of free 99mTc-DTPA was released after 30 min, and 12% was released after 60 min. In vivo, the clearances of both 99mTc-DTPA and 113mIn-DTPA in the smokers (n = 13) were faster than in the nonsmokers (n = 7) (p less than 0.05). Within the smokers, the mean 99mTc-DTPA clearance (T1/2 25 +/- 4 min) was faster than the mean 113mIn-DTPA clearance (34 +/- 6 min), (p less than 0.05). For nonsmokers, the difference was smaller (T1/2 99mTc-DTPA, 56 +/- 6; T1/2 113mIn-DTPA, 62 +/- 6) and not significant. During hyperinflation, smokers (n = 8) and nonsmokers (n = 8) both demonstrated an increase in 113mIn-DTPA clearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we have investigated the contribution of cholinergic-mediated bronchoconstriction in the airway response provoked by inhaled prostaglandin (PG)D2, its metabolite 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2, and PGF2 alpha, which are generated during mast cell activation in vivo and are potent bronchoconstrictor agonists in humans. The effect of prior inhalation of 1 mg ipratropium bromide (IB) on the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled methacholine (MCh), PGD2, 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2, and PGF2 alpha was determined in 7 allergic asthmatic subjects by measuring changes in SGaw, FEV1, and Vmax30. Methacholine, PGD2, and 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 caused concentration-related bronchoconstriction with PGD2 and 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 being between 45 and 112 times more potent than MCh (p less than 0.05), depending on the method used to measure airway caliber. Preinhalation of IB displaced the concentration response curves to MCh between 69- and 196-fold to the right, and this was significantly greater than that observed with PGD2 (12- to 23-fold, p less than 0.02) and 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 (12- to 22-fold, p less than 0.02). Ipratropium bromide inhibited the bronchoconstriction achieved with the highest concentration of agonist by 73 to 91% with MCh, 46 to 79% with PGD2, and 32 to 38% with 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2. Ipratropium bromide did not affect the bronchoconstriction pattern to inhaled PGF2 alpha, irrespective of the nature of the response. We conclude that although PGD2 and 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 are potent contractile agonists of human smooth muscle in vitro, bronchoconstriction observed with these mediators in vivo results from a combination of both direct and cholinergic-mediated mechanisms.\r"

To characterize the effect of PAF on human airways, 6 normal subjects and 6 subjects with mild asthma inhaled PAF using a standard bronchoprovocation protocol and nebulizer concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 micrograms/ml. Aerosolized PAF produced bronchoconstriction in 5 of 6 normal and 3 of 6 asthmatic subjects as defined by at least a 35% decrease in specific airway conductance (SGaw). However, in these same subjects, flow rates measured at 30% of vital capacity from a partial forced expiratory maneuver (V30P) did not decrease at least 30% nor did the FEV1 decrease by 20%. The 8 PAF responders were 5 to 836 times more sensitive to PAF than to methacholine when SGaw was used to assess the airway response. The relative airway sensitivity of the PAF nonresponders could not be assessed. Normal and asthmatic subjects could not be differentiated by their airway response to PAF, and there were no clinical features that differentiated PAF responders from nonresponders. The maximal airway response to PAF occurred within 2 to 3 min and lasted 15 to 45 min. There were no late reactions. Both normal (p less than 0.01) and asthmatic (p less than 0.05) subjects exhibited tachyphylaxis to PAF. Finally, PAF sensitized the airways of all normal subjects to methacholine, including the one PAF nonresponder (p less than 0.02), but it did not sensitize the airways of the asthmatic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On 4 separate days, 3 consecutive histamine or methacholine tests were carried out, each of them 20 min after saline (placebo) and after 100, 100, and 200 mg intravenous theophylline ethylenediamine given in a cumulative fashion. Airway responsiveness was expressed as the provocative dosage of histamine or methacholine necessary to increase specific airway resistance by 100% (PD100SRaw). After placebo PD100SRaw for histamine showed a small but significant (p less than 0.01) increase not observed after methacholine. Theophylline markedly attenuated airway reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. At a mean (SD) serum concentration of 6.14 (0.30) mg/L, theophylline increased geometric mean PD100SRaw for histamine from 2.76 to 6.07 units (p less than 0.01) and for methacholine from 1.52 to 2.60 units (p less than 0.05). At a mean (SD) serum concentration of 12.9 (0.70) mg/L, theophylline increased geometric mean PD100SRaw for histamine from 2.70 to 17.1 units (p less than 0.01) and for methacholine from 1.28 to 4.98 units (p less than 0.01). Thus, there was a protective effect of theophylline on histamine and methacholine responsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma at \"subtherapeutic\" serum theophylline concentrations with increasing efficacy at higher serum theophylline concentrations. These observations may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of patients with mild asthma.\r"

A total of 50.9% of the residents had evidence of tuberculosis exposure by skin testing. There were no differences between patients with significant and nonsignificant reactions when comparing age, length of stay, functional status evaluated by Karnofsky scale, or number of underlying diseases. Second test conversion occurred in 4.3% of those patients who had been in the unit for less than 1 month and in 36% of those who had been residents for a period of 3 to 6 months (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "It is a commonly held opinion that acid-fast staining of urine or gastric aspirates is not a reliable indicator of mycobacterial disease because of the presence of saprophytic mycobacteria. In order to determine the clinical usefulness of acid-fast staining of these body fluids, we reviewed our 10-yr experience with acid-fast stains. Forty-seven of 5,829 urine specimens (0.8%) and 39 of 309 gastric aspirates (12.6%) yielded mycobacteria on culture. Twenty-three urine specimens and 12 gastric aspirates had positive acid-fast stains. Of these, only one possible false positive acid-fast stain of urine (less than 1%) was found and none was found in gastric aspirates. Thus, acid-fast stains of urine and gastric aspirates are, when positive, reliable indicators of true mycobacterial disease.\r"

  ".W": "Erythromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used in patients with respiratory infections. Certain of these patients become colonized with new microorganisms and develop superinfections. Antibiotics have a number of effects other than simply killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria and may have direct effects upon host cells, including phagocytes. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that erythromycin decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) directed migration. To test the hypothesis that erythromycin inhibits normal PMN migration into the alveoli in response to a bacterial challenge, mice were challenged by aerosol inhalation with Proteus mirabilis or Staphylococcus aureus and injected intravenously with erythromycin (50 or 100 mg/kg). Pulmonary bactericidal activity and total lavaged lung cell and differential counts were determined 4 h after bacterial challenge. In control mice, only 24 +/- 2% of the initial inoculum of P. mirabilis was viable at 4 h. At a dose of 100 mg/kg, lung defenses after erythromycin were ablated, allowing the proliferation of P. mirabilis to 113 +/- 5% of the initial inoculum. The number of PMN obtained by lavage after P. mirabilis challenge was also inhibited by erythromycin in a dose-dependent manner. In untreated animals, 5.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) PMN were recovered as compared with 3.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) and 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) with increasing doses of erythromycin. Intrapulmonary bactericidal activity against S. aureus was not impaired by erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88047689\r", 
  ".W": "Asbestos bodies (AB) were counted by light microscopy in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from 563 subjects. The presence of AB was found to reflect occupational exposure to asbestos and was rarely found in unexposed control subjects at concentrations above 1/ml of fluid (6.9% of white collar workers and 17.8% of blue collar workers). The overlap of results observed between subjects with definite exposure and those without underlines the difficulty in assessing exposure by questioning alone, which leads to underestimations or even overestimations of the risk. The highest counts (log mean, 120.5 AB/ml; range, 0 to 42,600) were found in patients with radiologic evidence of asbestosis, most likely reflecting the known association of this disease with retention of large amounts of long amphiboles, rather than in patients with pleural disease. A considerable overlap of results was also observed between groups with different diseases or without any apparent disease. Apart from uncertainties in the radiologic diagnosis, this may be explained by differences in latency since first exposure, in individual response to asbestos inhalation, or in pathogenic properties of different asbestos types. Because the presence of AB in BAL fluid appears to be a marker of exposure and not of disease, AB are more likely to be detected in patients presenting with asbestos-related diseases but in whom exposure is not confirmed by the occupational history (65 of 78 cases).\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage cytotoxicity for Cryptococcus neoformans was investigated by culturing human alveolar macrophage (AM) with a thin-capsuled clone of C. neoformans in a polypropylene culture tube assay system. Yeast replication was quantitated by electronic particle counting after detergent lysis of AM and viability by quantitative plate counts. Under appropriate conditions, fungal replication was inhibited in the presence of human AM. This effect persisted over the 48-h time course that was evaluated. During this period, organisms in medium alone proliferated rapidly, doubling their number every 4 h. Human AM did not require endotoxin, fetal calf serum, or specific rabbit anticryptococcal antibody for fungistasis. Under these conditions, microscopic evaluation of a cytocentrifuge preparation of AM-yeast cocultures, stained by a modified Giemsa technique, revealed all the fungi to be extracellular. In the presence of 10% fresh human serum, AM phagocytized C. neoformans and exhibited fungicidal activity. Tumor necrosis factor did not affect the replication rate of the yeast. These findings suggest that there may be at least 2 mechanisms by which human AM protect against C. neoformans. One is serum-independent and extracellular and results in fungistasis, and the other is dependent on a serum factor and leads to intracellular inhibition of growth and possibly killing of the organism.\r"

  ".W": "Hybridoma technology has revolutionized the diagnosis of human disease. Owing to the unique specificity of monoclonal antibodies (MABs) of murine origin, hundreds of highly sensitive, accurate in vitro diagnostic tests have been developed for clinical laboratory and at-home use. Major research efforts are now underway to exploit this specificity for direct therapeutic purposes: MABs are being used by themselves in treating lymphomas, and in conjugated form with radionuclides, toxins, and chemotherapeutic drugs to treat a variety of tumors. Human MABs now are being tested in tumor imaging and for treatment of infectious diseases. New technologies have been developed to alter the genetic structure of MABs (eg, chimeric antibodies) to increase their treatment efficacy. As development of therapeutic uses for these reagents continues and, especially, as they receive approval for general clinical use, hundreds of kilograms per year will have to be produced. This paper reviews some of the recent developments in this area and describes two novel technologies that have been developed for large-scale cultivation of hybridoma cells.\r"

The records of over 1,000 patients requiring ventilatory assistance were reviewed. A comparison of this experience with Brantigan and Grow's original series and subsequent reports was used to establish the criteria and technique for cricothyroidotomy. It appears that while cricothyroidotomy has specific advantages, it also has disadvantages and a higher incidence of airway stenosis than either of the procedures it was designed to replace (low tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation). For this reason, its use has been severely restricted in Colorado, where it was popularized.\r"

This experiment was undertaken in order to determine whether the toxin can improve the airway in subjects with bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. The toxin was injected into the cricothyroid muscle to block neuromuscular transmission at the motor end-plate. Paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle was achieved and documented by electromyography and videotaped endoscopy. Paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle decreases the tension of the true vocal cord and allows the cord to take a more lateral position. In this preliminary report, the literature is reviewed, the effect of and action of the toxin are discussed, and the results of the experimental protocol, establishment of dose-response curves, and techniques of injection are presented. Preliminary data suggest that there is an increase in the airway by lateralizing the true vocal cord with this biologic substance, and that this method may have many applications in clinical medicine for the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon.\r"

In continuous-infusion experiments, the mean penetrations into CSF were 14.6 and 35% for ticarcillin and clavulanic acid, respectively, in rabbits with E. coli meningitis and 6.1 and 24%, respectively, in rabbits with H. influenzae meningitis. In animals that received a continuous infusion of the two drugs alone or in combination, the median CSF bactericidal titers for E. coli were less than 1:2, less than 1:2, and 1:2 for ticarcillin, clavulanic acid, and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, respectively, and for H. influenzae the titers were less than 1:2, less than 1:2, and 1:4, respectively. The addition of clavulanic acid potentiated significantly the bacteriological efficacy of ticarcillin in reducing the number of bacteria in CSF of infected rabbits. Additional studies in animals and humans are required before recommendations can be made regarding the use of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid for treatment of meningitis.\r"

A protein of approximately 70 kilodaltons was consistently produced by E. coli maxicells harboring the cloned tet determinant. A 500-base-pair restriction fragment from within the 2.25-kb tet region was shown to hybridize only to DNA from tetracycline-resistant strains of C. jejuni and C. coli, but not to the DNA of organisms known to carry the streptococcal tetM determinant. No homology was noted between the DNA of 10 tetracycline-resistant isolates of campylobacter and the streptococcal tetL, tetM, or tetN determinants when tested under conditions of high stringency.

The accumulation of [3H]tobramycin in proximal and distal tubules in both normal and infected rats was compared. Following induction of pyelonephritis, disturbed intrarenal localization of the drug was noted. Grain counts were affected in both proximal and distal tubules. Decreased labeling was observed at all time intervals in the proximal tubules. Electron microscopy showed that radioactivity was associated mostly with lysosomes in both normal and infected rats 1 and 24 h following the injection of the drug. We could detect significantly higher amounts of drug in the distal tubules of the pyelonephritic kidney than the normal levels at 10 min and 24 h postinjection. The drug did not seem to be associated with any particular organelle and was evenly distributed within the distal tubular cells. The present study shows that the transport of tobramycin within the infected nephron is disturbed. These data might shed some light on the influence of infection on the intrarenal pharmacology of aminoglycosides.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of visna virus replication in vitro by several compounds previously reported to inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was examined. Ribavirin concentrations as high as 1 mM reduced virus production by less than 50% relative to controls. The concentration of phosphonoformate reducing virus replication by 50% was 80 microM. 2',3'-Dideoxynucleosides were potent inhibitors of visna virus replication. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for dideoxyguanosine, dideoxyadenosine, and dideoxycytidine were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 microM, respectively. In contrast, weak inhibition was produced by 100 microM dideoxythymidine. These results are consistent with the reported susceptibility of HIV replication to inhibition by these compounds in vitro. The interaction of visna virus reverse transcriptase with several inhibitors was also examined. Reverse transcriptase was inhibited by phosphonoformate, ribavirin 5'-triphosphate, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The last four compounds inhibited incorporation of homologous 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates into polynucleotides by a competitive mechanism. In view of the biological similarities between visna virus and HIV and the similar in vitro susceptibility of visna virus replication to known inhibitors of HIV, visna virus may provide a good model for studying the inhibition of HIV replication in vitro. Because visna virus is not pathogenic to humans, this model may facilitate the identification of compounds for further investigation into the treatment of HIV-induced disease.\r"

Cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime solutions were studied under MIC and serum inhibitory titer testing conditions. Cefotaxime concentrations, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, decreased 20 to 30% over the incubation period in various systems tested; the greatest decline occurred in systems containing serum in the media. Changes in the results of microbiological susceptibility tests interpreted after 6 and 18 h of incubation were consistent with changes observed in the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.

We investigated whether prolonged occlusion of the skin causes skin irritation, and in this way might play a role in the possible induction of sensitization to drugs from these systems. Occlusion was effected with a placebo transdermal therapeutic system and silver-patch test in a time span ranging from eight hours to seven days in five groups of five volunteers. Skin irritation was judged on clinical aspects, histopathologic and immunofluorescence findings, and changes in the Langerhans' cell systems. The results indicate that occlusion with the systems used in this experiment provokes only slight or no skin irritation.\r"

  ".W": "The immunologic specificity of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) antigens was studied by serologic analysis. Serum samples of 19 patients with PV antibodies were tested for reactivity with seven specimens of normal human skin by indirect immunofluorescence. Some PV antibodies reacted to antigens expressed in all specimens of skin, while others reacted to antigens expressed in only some specimens of skin. This was not due to differences in the titer of PV antibodies among serum samples or to regional variation or individual-to-individual fluctuations in the expression of a single PV antigen. The patterns of cross-reactivity suggest that PV antigens are heterogeneous. Two different groups can be defined serologically: (1) a \"major\" (PV) antigen expressed in all individuals, antibodies to which are the most common in PV; (2) a family of \"minor\" PV antigens whose expression varies from individual to individual. Several immunologically distinct PV antigens are expressed concurrently in the same specimen of skin.\r"

The most severe EEG depression occurred in the four infants with subcortical cysts, who also had the poorest outcome. Six of eight infants with periventricular lesions had lesser degrees of abnormality though all infants had moderate to severe handicap at follow up. Similar abnormalities were seen on EEG recording in three infants in whom the densities resolved without cyst formation and these infants also had an abnormal outcome. An abnormal EEG recording provides a sensitive early guide to the severity and prognosis of these lesions, even before they can be seen on ultrasonography.\r"

The preterm infants had smaller left to right shunts shortly after birth--49 ml/kg/minute (95% confidence limits 38-59). There was no obvious subsequent change in the mean shunt, although by 48 hours there was greater variation in the size of the shunt. The respiratory distress syndrome did not affect the size of the ductal shunt, but the shorter the gestation period the larger the shunt by 48 hours. A ductal flow of greater than 70 ml/kg/minute at 48 hours of age predicted the subsequent development of a ductal murmur with 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity.\r"

The patient died 18 weeks after successful grafting and specimens of tissues were obtained at necropsy. Alpha-mannosidase activity in spleen and liver was just below normal (spleen 102 mumol/g/hour, control 113-330; liver 29 mumol/g/hour, control 30-131). Splenic alpha-mannosidase activity was indistinguishable from the control enzyme with respect to the Michaelis constant, heat stability, and inhibition by cobalt ions, as was 86% of the liver enzyme. In brain tissue alpha-mannosidase activity was 7% of controls, and less than one third had the properties of the normal enzyme. Oligosaccharides were present only in small amounts in liver and spleen, whereas they were greatly increased in brain tissue. Electron microscopic pictures of liver and spleen tissue showed normal morphology, but brain tissue showed definite vacuolation. These findings suggest that transplantation reversed the somatic changes of alpha-mannosidosis but did not affect lysosomal storage within brain tissue. It is concluded that marrow transplantation may not be a suitable treatment for alpha-mannosidosis.\r"

The hepatic glucose production rate was less than 20% of normal for fasting term neonates in all four babies and yet insulin concentrations were never greater than 12 microU/ml; two babies had very low glucagon concentrations (less than 60 ng/l). Two further neonates with similar histories also had plasma glucagon concentrations that were also extremely low (less than 20 ng/l). A single intravenous bolus of glucagon caused a rapid rise in hepatic glucose production rate towards the normal range, which was sustained for many hours after the bolus had been given. Diazoxide given to one baby suppressed previously 'normal' insulin concentrations still further (4.2 to less than 1.6 microU/ml) and thereby restored the hepatic glucose production rate to normal. In view of the normal plasma insulin concentrations at a time when the hepatic glucose production rate was reduced, we feel that the absolute concentration of insulin may be less important than the insulin/glucagon molar ratio in the control of glucose homeostasis in this group of infants. The changing of this ratio by means of boluses of glucagon may be useful in preventing rebound hypoglycaemia, which so often occurs when dextrose infusions are reduced either accidentally or in an attempt to restart oral feeds.\r"

The introduction of new diagnostic techniques over the course of this study improved the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis but did not lead to earlier diagnosis.

Of the 14 patients with metastases to regional lymph nodes, 27% survived disease-free for 5 years. Surgical mortality was 25% for the entire series but has been reduced to 6.6% over the past decade. Surgical mortality was primarily due to leakage of the pancreaticojejunostomy; the risk of pancreaticojejunostomy leak correlated inversely with the degree of chronic pancreatitis in the pancreatic remnant. In 35% of resected cases, a benign adenomatous component was contained within the cancer of the ampulla of Vater. Cure rates are good for this lesion. The most important factor in maximizing cure rate is careful attention to the technical details of pancreaticojejunostomy in order to minimize surgical mortality. Benign adenomas appear to be a frequent precursor of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.\r"

Dacron grafts (both knitted and woven), Teflon grafts, and Dacron grafts coated with one and two layers of silicone were studied because these materials differ significantly in porosity, hydrophobicity, and surface charge (zeta potential). Graft segments were immersed in 3H-labeled bacteria solution for periods ranging from 5 to 180 minutes and liquid scintillation techniques were used to quantify bacterial adherence. The porous knitted Dacron material had a significantly higher rate of bacterial adherence than either the woven Dacron or Teflon (p less than 0.05). Silicone coating (either one or two layers) reduced adherence by a factor of four for the knitted Dacron (p less than 0.05) and by a factor of two for woven Dacron (p less than 0.05). The mucous producing strain of S. epidermidis displayed significantly better adherence to woven and knitted Dacron than the normucous producing strain, but only when 0.25% dextrose was added to the bacteria solution. These findings indicate that the highly porous knitted Dacron grafts have the highest propensity for bacterial adhesion. Graft materials with the most negative zeta potentials are more resistant to bacterial adherence. Silicone coating of Dacron material significantly changed adherence characteristics, suggesting that this may be a viable strategy for protecting implantable medical devices containing materials to which bacteria readily adhere.\r"

Addition of pulse oximetry improved the correlation (r = 0.93) and decreased the difference between absolute values (0.02 +/- 0.06).

In preliminary studies, sequential filling of multisegmented leggings with graded pressure decreasing from ankle to knee increased venous flow velocity and wall shear stress, decreased residual venous volume, and enhanced postoperative fibrinolysis more than uniform compression. To determine if improved hemodynamics also increased antithrombotic activity, we performed a prospective randomized trial in neurosurgical patients comparing sequential application of graded pressure with uniform pressure applied to either a segmented bladder or to a single bladder. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by leg scanning and impedance plethysmography and confirmed by phlebography. Venous thrombosis developed in 3 of 45 patients with graded-sequential filling, 6 of 50 with uniform compression-multiple compartments, and 3 of 41 with uniform pressure single bladder (differences not significant). These results suggest either that uniform compression offers all that can be expected of external pneumatic calf compression in prevention of venous thrombosis, or that even if a study with greater statistical power showed graded-sequential filling to be superior, the benefit/cost ratio of the more complex latter system is not likely to be large.\r"

The cumulative allograft and patient survival for the entire series (follow-up 9-36 months) was 84% and 95%, respectively. This improvement in the rate of successful transplantation can be attributed to the selective addition of ALS therapy to recipients with specific instances of renal allograft dysfunction. In this report, the indications for the use of ALS preparations following prophylactic CsA immunosuppression are reviewed. Experience with the protocols of the ALS administration is also discussed. In selected cases, the administration of either ATG or OKT3 can significantly benefit CsA recipients who experience either primary allograft nonfunction or an epidose of acute rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Necrotizing fasciitis has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thirty-three patients were studied over a 3-year period. Predisposing factors included intravenous drug abuse (30%), diabetes (21%), and obesity (18%). Severe pain (94%) and abnormal temperature (88%) were present, whereas laboratory data and x-ray were nonspecific. Gram-positive organisms were most frequently recovered (B-hemolytic streptococcus 45%). Treatment consisted of antibiotics, surgical debridement, re-exploration 24 hours before surgery, nutritional support, and early soft tissue coverage as needed. Mean duration from admission to operation was 43 hours. The average number of operative debridements was three and the average length of hospitalization was 47 days. Patients operated on less than 12 hours from admission or greater than 48 hours had shorter hospital stays (36 and 38 days). The critical time period was 12-48 hours after admission; all deaths and amputations were in this group and the average hospital stay was 62 days (p less than 0.05). The number of operations did not correlate to hospital stay. Despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement, significant morbidity exists if operation is delayed more than 12 hours. Methods of early detection such as local bedside diagnostic incision and fascial inspection may be needed in high risk patients to further reduce the morbidity and mortality.\r"

Because of the recent publication of new information, a review of available evidence concerning this issue was undertaken. Eight randomized clinical trials were assessed regarding trial design. The studies varied according to generalizability, diagnostic criteria, choice of therapy, outcome measures assessed, evaluation of compliance, methods of analysis, duration of follow-up, determination of side effects, and ability to exclude a type 2 error. While many of the earlier studies found no treatment effects, they lacked methodologic rigor; more recent studies demonstrated positive treatment effects. Pooling of results from similar trials supports a notable treatment effect in the prevention of stroke. There is also evidence that the elderly are not more susceptible to side effects of antihypertensive drugs, as is generally believed. The best evidence suggests the hypertensive elderly should be treated.\r"

Isolation of the bacterium from blood only was associated with a high mortality rate, in contrast to its isolation both from blood and stool.

Treatment was continued for at least four weeks in 22 cases and thereafter for as long as it was felt to be of benefit. Therapeutic efficacy was rated using a new PTSD scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale administered at four weekly intervals. Six patients completed four to eight weeks of phenelzine treatment; seven patients, nine to 13 weeks; and nine patients, 14 to 18 weeks. Comparison of mean prediscontinuation scores with pretreatment ratings showed, at best, only small (23% to 38%) differences (on the PTSD and Hamilton Anxiety scales) in the group treated for nine to 13 weeks. Two patients with a concurrent diagnosis of panic disorder and two with a concurrent diagnosis of dysthymic disorder were the most improved symptomatically but fell short of clinically significant remission. Although statistically significant improvement was observed on seven of the 12 items of the PTSD scale, sleep disturbance was the only symptom showing a clinically impressive change. These results only partially support previous positive reports of phenelzine treatment of PTSD.\r"

Computer-analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise as a tool for the differential diagnosis of dementia, but topographic methods for data collection and analysis have seldom been used. We used these methods to investigate EEG differences among three groups of elderly subjects: those with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), those with mild to moderate multi-infarct dementia (MID), and age- and sex-matched normal controls. The two groups of demented subjects were distinguished from the control group by a new criterion, the ratio of high-frequency to low-frequency electrical activity in the left temporal region, which was greatly diminished in demented subjects. Using this single variable, all control subjects and 15 of 18 demented subjects were correctly classified (sensitivity 83%, specificity 100%). The three misclassified subjects were among the least impaired subjects with DAT. Examination of coherence, or synchronization of the EEG signal, enabled us to distinguish subjects with DAT from those with MID. Using discriminant analysis of both EEG frequency and coherence, 92% (22/24) of subjects were accurately classified. These results justify further evaluation of topographic, computer-based EEG analysis as a test for the differential diagnosis of dementia.\r"

During ontogeny, the pluripotential stem cell emerges and differentiates into all hematopoietic lineages, including three major immunologically relevant components: T-cell differentiation occurs within the thymus; B cells appear within fetal liver, adult bone marrow, and possibly other abdominal sites; and concurrently, the monocyte-macrophage system develops. Under the influence of an array of cytokines and cellular interactions, immune regulation is established. T and B lymphocytes elaborate genetically encoded messages that acquire specificity via transposable genetic elements. Receptors and cytokines provide immune recognition, communication, regulation, and memory for antigens. Inherited and acquired defects in ontogeny and immune regulation are the basis for immunodeficiency disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The microenvironment within the thymus gland and various thymic hormones facilitates the maturation of prothymocytes to functional T lymphocytes. Abnormal thymic morphology is a hallmark feature of several primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Thymus glands from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or graft-vs-host disease and from patients receiving cyclosporine A therapy are depleted of thymocytes, have a striking reduction in thymic epithelial cell mass, and are virtually devoid of Hassall's corpuscles. In malnourished individuals, similar thymic atrophy is present, although the Hassall's corpuscles are present and cystically dilated. Absence of differentiation antigens or anomalous expression of major histocompatibility antigens occurs on thymic epithelial cells in these conditions, and resembles immunologic abnormalities of the thymus in severe combined immunodeficiency. In acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, and cyclosporine therapy, there is an expansion of cytotoxic/suppressor (CD8) lymphocytes. Experimental evidence suggests that in many situations, such cells may cause damage to the thymic epithelium. The damage to the thymic epithelium may alter the thymic microenvironment and contribute to the immune dysfunction observed in these patients. In addition, a damaged microenvironment may hinder therapeutic efforts to reconstitute immunity.\r"

This being so, this activity of macrophages may have a significant role in the progression of the lesions.

The subjects were randomly placed in either a control group or a treatment group. In each group the carpometacarpal (CMC), metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and interphalangeal (IP) joints of the most symptomatic thumb were \"treated\" with 15 sec irradiations at four equally spaced intervals around each joint three times a week for three weeks. The same protocol was used for both groups except that a hidden switch on the laser was placed in the \"on\" position for the treated group and in the \"off\" position for the control group. Although the laser-treated group noted slightly lessened tenderness of the treated MCP and IP joints (p less than 0.01 and 0.05, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and a small increase in three-finger chuck pinch strength (p less than 0.04, paired t-test), changes in ROM, pain, joint tenderness, grip and pinch strength, activity level, and medication use, did not significantly differ between the groups. Adverse effects were rare (one in each group), minimal, and subjective. We conclude that HeNe laser irradiation at 0.9 mw is safe, but that it is not an effective treatment of osteoarthritis of the thumb.\r"

In the first study there was an increased incidence of local recurrence in patients who had wide excision, but distant recurrence and survival were unaltered. In the second study, the distant recurrence and survival rates were also significantly impaired. A new analysis showed that there were significantly more patients with T1 tumors in the second study than in the first. Comparison of treatments by T status indicates that radical mastectomy gives significantly better results in patients with T1 tumors. There is no difference between the results of the two treatments in patients with T2 tumors. We comment on the implications of these findings for conservation treatment of early breast cancer.\r"

Of the 25 patients, five did not have catheters placed due to extrahepatic disease, and one patient did not receive infusion chemotherapy. Continuous floxuridine infusion was given at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/d, alternating with saline solution every two weeks. The mean percentage of hepatic tumor replacement (36% vs 41%), mean serum alkaline phosphatase level (218 vs 179 IU/mL), and mean plasma carcinoembryonic antigen level (689 vs 563 ng/mL) were similar in both groups. Four (50%) of eight hepatic artery patients responded to treatment compared with 0/11 portal vein patients. Ten of 11 portal vein patients showed progressive tumor growth; nine of these patients were crossed over to arterial infusion. Three (33%) of these nine patients had an objective tumor response with the hepatic arterial infusion. This prospective, randomized clinical trial demonstrates significantly improved tumor response after hepatic arterial infusion compared with portal vein infusion.\r"

Patients with histologically positive axillary lymph nodes were randomized after operation to receive melphalan or intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil for one year. After a median follow-up of ten years, there was no significant difference in the survival of the two groups (RM, 71%; MRM, 64%). Local recurrence after RM was significantly lower than after MRM. A subset of patients with more advanced cancers (T3 and T2 with clinically positive axillary nodes) experienced significantly better survival at ten years following RM compared with MRM (59% vs 38%, respectively). These results indicate that overall survival is similar for patients treated by either RM or MRM.

Furthermore, the current method of needle localization of these lesions is cumbersome and inefficient. Stereotaxic needle aspiration was used to examine 84 patients. Successful localization with the needle tip within 1 to 2 mm of the suspected lesion was possible in 80 cases (95.2%). Following aspirate cytology, the lesion was localized with indigo carmine and Kopans' wire and every patient underwent a standard open excisional biopsy. Twelve cases of breast cancer were diagnosed histologically. Eleven of these cases were correctly diagnosed cytologically, while one case yielded a false-negative result. In the remaining 72 histologically benign cases, four lesions were reported cytologically to be atypical. There were no complications. Stereotaxic needle aspiration localizes occult breast lesions precisely and in conjunction with mammography, and it is an acceptable preoperative method of diagnosing nonpalpable breast tumors.\r"

We have followed up 29 patients with clinically and electroencephalographically defined CPS of childhood onset for five years or more. Twelve patients are seizure free, eight of them after having epilepsy surgery. Of the remaining, eight patients have intractable seizures. Only one patient was able to discontinue anticonvulsant therapy after epilepsy surgery. No patient had spontaneous remission of seizures without anticonvulsant medications. School difficulties, behavior problems, and unemployment were seen in half the group. We believe CPS in this age group are difficult to control and need aggressive management. In selected patients, epilepsy surgery offers a good chance of seizure control and improvement of educational, social, and vocational potential.\r"

Indeed, in several instances, there was initial diagnostic confusion with CJD. Unlike the spongiform change in CJD, however, VC was almost entirely restricted to the medial temporal cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, the severity of VC was usually less intense than the spongiform change observed in cases of CJD with severe neurologic impairment. The VC could be readily distinguished from the fine microvacuolation of the upper layers of the isocortex reported in a number of different conditions, including AD. It also differed from the status spongiosus of the cerebral cortex that occurs in advanced AD and CJD as well as in other degenerative diseases. The artifactual rarefaction that occurs in improperly processed paraffin-embedded brain tissue was excluded as a contributory factor to the VC. Since VC does not invariably occur in AD, it conceivably could represent a subtype of this disorder or may represent a variant of the pathologic changes that can occur. Its relationship to CJD or other slow virus disorders is to date unknown but unlikely.\r"

  ".U": "88049010\r", 
  ".W": "That chronic alcoholism yields devastating effects to the central nervous systems of its victims is well known, but the actual physiologic mechanisms underlying that deterioration have yet to be completely identified. What is also known is that many chronic alcoholics seem to recover brain function after a protracted period of abstinence, but the actual mechanisms of that restoration are also not well understood. Using positron emission tomography with the tracer 11C-2-deoxy-D-glucose as a probe to measure regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (RCMRGlu), we compared the magnitudes of glucose consumption in 44 brain regions between a group of newly abstinent chronic alcoholics without Korsakoff's psychosis and a control group of normal nonalcoholic subjects whose range of age was that of the alcoholic group. We found that RCMRGlu measurements in the brains of alcoholics were significantly lower than in the brains of the control group, and that there were many fewer significant interregional correlations in the brains of the alcoholics than in the brains of the control group. We also found no significant correlation between age and global metabolic rate of glucose in either group. However, even though the number of alcoholic subjects was too few to allow a reliable statistical comparison, the measurements suggest that chronic alcoholics over the age of 50 years suffer a greater decrease of RCMRGlu values than do their counterparts under the age of 50 years. While resting in a bland environment, neither alcoholic nor control subjects were found to have significant differences in RCMRGlu values between their brain hemispheres. In contrast to this similarity, normal dextrous subjects responded to a nonverbal auditory stimulus by increasing the metabolic rate of glucose in their right hemispheres while eight of nine chronic alcoholics did not. The results of this pilot study point to arguments that the alcoholic brain metabolizes glucose at a lower rate than do normal brains, that there are fewer region-to-region functional relationships in the alcoholic brain than in the normal brain, and that alcoholics may be impaired in right hemispheric processing. In subsequent investigations, we will measure the metabolic changes that follow abstinence, if any, by tracking subjects throughout an interval of rehabilitation. Also, we intend to test the findings of this study by measuring greater numbers of alcoholic subjects to separate the consequences of measurement variability, age, and chance from the underlying biologic processes that seem to be affected by chronic alcoholism.\r"

The correlation between measurements of tumor thickness by CT scanning, standardized A-scan ultrasonography, and gross pathologic analysis was substantially better than that between the CT, ophthalmoscopic, and gross pathologic measurements of tumor basal diameters.

The clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis was corroborated by arthroscopic evidence of characteristic cartilage degeneration. Signs of inflammation were confined to areas of the synovial membrane that lay near the cartilage; thus, the major part of the joint cavity was not affected. The intensity of the synovial inflammation varied within the areas involved, but was always most pronounced in regions rimming the cartilage. Biopsy samples selected from regions of intensely inflamed synovium contained foci of T lymphocytes, which were bordered by immunoglobulin-carrying B lymphocytes and plasma cells, as well as strongly HLA-DR positive dendritic-like cells adjoined to alpha Leu-3a+ T helper lymphocytes. In tissue samples taken from macroscopically noninflamed areas, only a few infiltrating lymphocytes were seen. Thus, the inflammatory synovial changes found in osteoarthritis appear to be anatomically restricted and of varied intensity but, when present, are microscopically indistinguishable from the changes that have been previously described as indicative of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

We compared 51,797 patients exposed to NSAIDs with 35,634 age- and sex-matched patients who had not been exposed. As a class, NSAIDs were associated with an adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) of hypersensitivity reactions of 2.0 (1.3-2.9). The increased risk was accentuated in those with a diagnosis compatible with acute pain (3.6 [2.2-5.9]) and absent in those without such a diagnosis (1.1 [0.6-1.9]). Comparison of those exposed to zomepirac with those exposed to other NSAIDs resulted in an age-adjusted relative risk of 2.0 (1.1-4.7). Stratification by the probable indication for NSAID use again suggested that the risk may be explained by the use of the NSAIDs for different indications. We concluded that NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of allergy and/or anaphylaxis, and the use of zomepirac appears to be associated with an increased risk compared with the use of other NSAIDs. However, that increased risk may be a function of the primary indication for the drug or, more likely, the regimen associated with that indication, rather than an intrinsic property of the drug.\r"

Automated flow cytometry has made DNA analysis applicable to many solid tumors. Analysis can be performed on fixed specimens, allowing archival retrieval. The techniques, however, are unique and must be individually tested for each tumor type. Presently, few studies have been applied to head and neck cancers. This series of flow cytometric DNA analyses compares the results of 17 fresh and fixed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma specimens. Aneuploidy was present to a significant degree (47%). The method produced interpretable results in 100% of cases, with 100% reproducibility. Fresh and fixed tumor specimens yielded comparable results 76% of the time and, in fact, interpretability of fixed specimens was superior. This series demonstrates a practical and accurate flow cytometric DNA assay for fixed squamous cell carcinoma specimens, facilitating rapid retrospective ploidy analysis.\r"

These methods obscure the contribution of different tissue components to total receptor content. Recently developed, highly specific monoclonal antibodies to human ER and PgR were able to discern the presence of ER and PgR at the cellular level in 12 specimens of normal laryngeal tissue and eight laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Localization of ER and PgR was observed in the nuclei of vocalis muscle. No evidence of ER or PgR was found in epithelial components of the normal larynges or in laryngeal carcinomas. These results extend previous findings in lower primates and rodents to the human larynx and clarify previously reported receptor analyses of laryngeal carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "Although the mechanism responsible for the genesis of acquired renal cysts in hemodialysis patients has not been clearly defined, obstruction of the nephron by deposition of oxalate crystals may be an important factor. We performed this study to investigate this possibility. In 51 dialysis patients, the number and size of acquired cysts as well as kidney size were examined using sonography. Plasma oxalate levels were measured with capillary gas chromatography. Cysts were found in 6 of 18 (33.3%), 12 of 15 (75%), and 15 of 17 (88.2%) dialysis patients treated for 5, 10, and more than 10 years. The mean kidney size was significantly greater in hemodialysis patients with cysts than in those without cysts. There was a significant correlation between plasma oxalate levels and kidney size, particularly in patients dialyzed for longer periods (r = 0.638, P less than 0.01). Mean plasma oxalate levels of dialysis patients with renal cysts were significantly higher than those of noncystic patients (P less than 0.05). Although further evaluation is necessary to confirm these observations, our results suggest that oxalate crystal deposits in renal tubules secondary to hyperoxalemia in hemodialysis patients are a significant contributing factor to the formation of acquired renal cysts in these patients.\r"

Originally identified in men in wartime, it has been widely recognised as a common chronic condition in both sexes in civilian life. Although the symptoms may seem to appear after infections and various physical and psychological stresses, neurocirculatory asthenia is most often encountered as a familial disorder that is unrelated to these factors, although they may aggravate an existing tendency. Respiratory complaints (including breathlessness, with and without effort, and smothering sensations) are almost universal, and palpitation, chest discomfort, dizziness and faintness, and fatigue are common. The physical examination is normal. The aetiology is obscure but patients usually have a normal life span. Reassurance and measures to improve physical fitness are helpful.\r"

They had coronary arteriography (mean (SEM)) 3.1 (0.2) hours after the onset of chest pain with repeat studies 90 minutes and three days later. In 12 (29%) patients the infarct related coronary artery was patent at the first arteriogram (group 1). A further 10 patients, nine of whom received thrombolytic treatment, showed early recanalisation of the infarct related coronary artery within 90 minutes of treatment (group 2). In the remainder the infarct related coronary artery was persistently occluded (group 3). Baseline values for infarct location, the sum of ST elevation in all leads, QRS scores, and serum creatine kinase activity did not permit discrimination between the groups. Nevertheless, patterns of ST segment change and enzyme release in group 1 were closely similar to those that occurred in response to thrombolysis in group 2. Thus compared with group 3, groups 1 and 2 showed earlier 50% reduction in the sum of peak ST elevation in all leads and earlier peaking of serum creatine kinase activity. Importantly, creatine kinase release was significantly attenuated in group 1, rising to a peak serum activity (mean (SEM)) of only 1242 (415) IU/1. Analysis of angiographic left ventricular ejection fractions at three days indicated limitation of infarct size in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3. Mean (SEM) ejection fraction, however, was best preserved in group 1 (62(6)%) and in this group the frequency of non-Q wave infarction was higher than in groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Felodipine (10 mg twice daily) or a corresponding placebo was added to conventional treatment. After three weeks haemodynamic function was assessed at rest, during a standard supine leg exercise, and during 45 degrees passive upright tilt. In patients in the supine resting position, felodipine reduced the mean arterial pressure (9%) and systemic vascular resistance (24%) and increased the stroke volume (25%) and cardiac index (23%). The heart rate and right and left ventricular filling pressures were unchanged. During felodipine treatment the standard exercise was accomplished at a similar cardiac index but at a substantially lower heart rate (7%), arterial pressure (10%), systemic vascular resistance (17%), and left ventricular filling pressure (19%), and a higher stroke volume (13%). During both placebo and felodipine administration there were substantial reductions in cardiac filling pressure during upright tilting. Upright tilting during the placebo phase did not increase the heart rate. It also caused a greater fall in systemic vascular resistance while the arterial pulse pressure but not the mean pressure was maintained and the cardiac index and stroke volume increased. The reduced cardiac filling pressures during the felodipine upright tilt were accompanied by reductions in arterial pulse pressure and stroke volume and the patients were able to maintain the mean arterial pressure by an increase in both the heart rate and systemic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This resulted in alveolar collapse, an arterial PO2 of less than 15 kPa on 100% oxygen and an inflection point on the inspiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve at an airway pressure of 8-10 mm Hg. One group of eight animals was then ventilated with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) equal to the pressure at the inflection point, whilst the second group of eight was ventilated with a PEEP 5 mm Hg less than the inflection point. Animals in the high PEEP group had a significantly greater arterial PO2 than those in the low PEEP group, but the mean survival time for each group was similar. However, there was a significantly greater incidence of hyaline membranes in the low PEEP group. Various mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed.\r"

The site of the antigen was determined using sera from two LAD, 13 CBDC and two CCP patients. In all 31 patients the IgA was located predominantly below the lamina lucida (sublamina densa). Similarly, the indirect immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrated the antigen to be present at the same site, below the lamina densa. This suggests that in linear IgA bullous dermatosis the antibody reacts with the antigen in the sublamina densa region of the basement membrane zone.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of involucrin was examined in 23 skin tumours of hair follicle origin, 17 tumours of sweat gland origin and three tumours of unknown origin, using an immunoperoxidase technique. All tumours from the hair follicle showed a positive reaction for involucrin. In particular keratoacanthoma and the squamous eddies in various tumours stained strongly. Trichofolliculoma, trichilemmoma and pilomatrixoma exhibited characteristic staining patterns which resembled those in the normal hair follicle. On the other hand the majority of the tumours of sweat gland origin did not stain, with restricted positive reactions in areas showing lumen formation or squamous metaplasia. In contrast to the lack of staining in syringoma, a positive reaction was observed in desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, which is histologically similar to syringoma. Clear cell acanthoma, the origin of which is still controversial, showed a staining pattern which indicated that its origin may not be in the sweat gland. These results suggest that testing for involucrin in skin appendage tumours may be very useful for understanding the kinetics of maturation as well as in determining the origin of the tumours.\r"

Follow-up examinations were carried out monthly and the efficacy of treatment was evaluated by using the PASI score. Adverse effects of the treatment were recorded monthly; liver enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. After 2 months of treatment the maintenance dose was reduced in some of the patients either because of complete remission or adverse effects. After 2 months treatment, groups receiving 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day showed significantly lower PASI scores than the placebo group. The 10 mg/day group showed a response intermediate between the 25 mg and 50 mg groups and the placebo group. Thus, the optimal initial dose seems to be approximately 25 mg/day and the maintenance dose somewhat lower. Six months after the start of treatment there were no significant differences between the four groups; the last follow-up examination took place during the summer and some of the patients probably experienced spontaneous improvement. Although clinical adverse effects were frequent in all groups, severe side effects, namely hair loss and paronychia, occurred frequently only among patients treated with an initial dose of 50 mg of etretin daily. The effect of treatment on liver enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides was minimal.\r"

This ultrastructural localization was confirmed in only three of these nine by immuno-electron microscopy. Clinical details were available on six of these nine cases, and none had clinical features suggesting EBA. We have found the split-skin immunofluorescence technique unhelpful in identifying 'missed' cases of EBA. The prevalence of EBA presenting as BP would appear to be very low indeed in the U.K.\r"

Primary failure of the argon laser to produce permanent blanching graded good or excellent was the most important factor limiting the final cosmetic results whilst severe scarring was rare (less than 2%). In order to improve the efficacy of this treatment, a randomized controlled study of different parameters of laser treatment was undertaken in test patches of port-wine stains in 50 patients. A treatment pattern with contiguous or overlapping laser spots was significantly superior to treatment with spots of 1 or 2 mm separation. Increasing the power level to twice the minimum blanching power did not improve efficacy or significantly increase scarring. A randomized study of selective absorption using a neodymium (Nd) YAG laser showed similar efficacy for the different wavelengths although scarring was greater with the Nd-YAG laser. This study has shown that laser treatment can offer a moderately effective treatment for port-wine stains. For best results spot separation needs to be carefully controlled, whilst wavelength and power level appear to be less important than previously reported.\r"

Eight Spitz naevi were investigated immunohistologically with monoclonal antibodies against HLA-antigens and malignancy-associated melanocytic antigens which are rarely present in common naevi. Naevus cells in all lesions expressed HLA-ABC antigens, but lacked HLA-DR antigens in seven of the eight lesions. All naevi were positive for 'constitutive' (KG-6-56) and 'early' (K-1-2) markers of naevomelanocytic cells. In five of the eight Spitz naevi, at least one of the three malignancy-associated melanocytic antigens PAL-M1, A-1-43 and A-10-33 was found. The expression of malignancy-associated antigens in multiple agminate Spitz naevi is at variance with their benign clinical course.\r"

The techniques are relatively inexpensive, though labour intensive. Negative reactions were found in treated cases and in those with some delay in the histochemical staining.\r"

The patient was begun on systemic chemotherapy and external beam radiation to the eye and orbit, with resultant preservation of the eye, vision, and probable extension of life because of early detection of reticulum cell sarcoma by choroidal biopsy. This technique may be advantageous in the diagnosis cases of eyes with clinical evidence of reticulum cell sarcoma, no systemic signs of malignancy, and negative vitreous biopsies.\r"

In this report we describe a new assay that takes advantage of these highly specific reagents to investigate selectively platelet reactive antibodies against epitopes on different glycoproteins. The reliability and specificity of this assay is demonstrated with known platelet-reactive autoantibodies and alloantibodies (anti-PIA1, -Baka, -Pen). The discovery of a PIA2 antibody in a serum of a polytransfused patient underscores the efficiency of this technique. Possible applications of this assay are discussed in detail.\r"

  ".W": "For direct studies of growth control, a method was developed to purify viable human megakaryocytes to homogeneity from routine normal bone marrow aspirates. An initial separation of marrow over a 1.050 g/mL Percoll density cut was used to enrich megakaryocytes. After washing, the cells were specifically labeled with a fluoresceinated monoclonal antibody or F(ab')2 fragment to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex. Megakaryocytes were selectively sorted by using Becton Dickinson FACStar flow cytometer on the basis of a fluorescence intensity greater than 50-fold that of control cells. To increase resolution and purity the sorting rate was adjusted to one cell in 13 formed drops, and negative events that coincided with positive ones were aborted. Two thirds of the isolated cells were large, morphologically recognizable megakaryocytes with a forward light scatter fourfold that of the main cell population. Microscopic examination showed these cells to be greater than or equal to 98% megakaryocytes with a diameter of 20 to 46 microns and a ploidy range of 2N to 64N with a mode of 16N. The small highly fluorescent cells were 10 to 21 microns in diameter, and their ploidy range from 2N to 32N with main ploidy classes of 2N and 4N. The majority of these small cells also positively reacted with monoclonal antibody to platelet GPIb. The isolated cells were cultured in either Iscove's or leucine, lysine-deficient RPMI 1640 medium with 10% human plasma. The cells were maintained in culture more than three days and were capable of synthesis of both DNA and protein as assessed by radiolabeled thymidine and amino acid incorporation. Moreover, the isolated megakaryocytes were capable of responding to recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The data show that human megakaryocytes can be purified from routine marrow aspirates on the basis of a lineage marker and that they are capable of growth in vitro.\r"

Blood mononuclear cells were depleted of monocytes by one-step Percoll density gradient centrifugation and tested for antigen expression by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The reactivity of patient lymphocytes was as follows: 26 of 31 were positive for CD14 (Myr), 22 of 31 for a monocyte Fc receptor (MFC-1), 22 of 31 for CD11b (C3bi receptor), eight of 31 for CD15 (Leu-M1), five of 18 for CD13 (My 7), seven of 18 for My 9, and five of 30 for Mo 2. The B lymphocytes of B-CLL patients were also tested for the ability to produce interleukin 1 (IL-1) after depletion of monocytes and T lymphocytes. In 13 of 17 cases, B lymphocytes of patients produced IL-1 as detected in a mouse thymocyte proliferation assay and, in selected cases, a radioimmunoassay specific for IL-1 beta. The 13 cases that produced IL-1 were also positive for the expression of one or more myelomonocytic-associated antigens, whereas the four cases that did not produce IL-1 lacked expression of these antigens. In conclusion, the malignant B cells of B-CLL patients frequently express a variety of antigens generally considered specific for myelomonocytic cells, and expression of these antigens is associated with the ability to produce IL-1.\r"

Estimated frequencies for progenitor cells responding to G-CSF were one in 489 for colonies scored at day 7, and one in 1,015 for day 14 colonies. For GM-CSF the frequencies were one in 1,407 (day 7) and one in 574 (day 14). The effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT) on the frequency of progenitors responding to either G-CSF or GM-CSF was determined. Both TNF and LT inhibited the response of cells to G-CSF, and in these cultures the frequency of progenitor cells that responded to G-CSF was reduced to less than one in 100,000 cells. In contrast, the frequency of cells able to form colonies in cultures stimulated with GM-CSF was unaltered by either cytotoxin. This differential sensitivity to cytotoxins suggests that either G-CSF and GM-CSF are acting on separate granulocyte progenitor populations or that TNF and LT selectively influence the biochemical pathways associated with the activation of receptors for G-CSF.\r"

  ".U": "88051298\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we detected a factor that stimulates the proliferation of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic precursors in diffusion chambers implanted in mice. This factor, called diffusible colony-stimulating factor (D-CSF), was found in medium conditioned in the presence of spleen and peripheral blood cells from mice with B cell leukemia (BCL1). After the administration of D-CSF, the number of colonies formed in the plasma clot inside the chamber (CFU-DG) was increased, as were the number of hematopoietic precursors (CFU-MIX, CFU-S, CFU-C, and BFU-E) as judged by a subculture of diffusion chamber contents. Depletion of macrophages and T cells from the spleen cell suspension did not decrease the production of D-CSF, thereby indicating that it was derived from B cells. Neoplastic BCL1 cells appear to be the source because D-CSF could not be detected in medium conditioned with normal B cells. BCL1-conditioned medium (CM) did not enhance CFU-MIX, BFU-E, and CFU-C colony formation in vitro, which suggested that D-CSF is different from multi-CSF, EPA, or CSF. The addition of BCL1 CM to multi-CSF-, erythroid potentiating activity (EPA), and CSF (EL-4CM)-containing cultures had no effect on CFU-MIX, BFU-E, and CFU-C colony formation, thus indicating the absence of a synergistic or inhibitory activity. On the other hand, EL-4 CM, which stimulates CFU-MIX, BFU-E, and CFU-C in vitro, had no effect on CFU-DG in vivo. Biochemical characterization of BCL1 CM revealed that D-CSF is relatively heat stable and loses its bioactivity with protease treatments. It binds to lentil-lectin, according to gel-filtration chromatography has a relative molecular weight of approximately 43,000, and on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography elutes with acetonitrile. These data also indicate that transformed B cells may serve as a source for hematopoietic regulators that act on hematopoietic precursors in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical observations during infection suggest that in aged patients, the kinetic or proliferative responses of neutrophils to infection may be deranged. To test this hypothesis, the neutrophil responses of 6-month-old and 30-month-old mice were compared. After intrapulmonary injection of Escherichia coli, young mice exhibited neutrophilia and diminution of the neutrophil storage pool (NSP) by a mean of 6.4 x 10(6) neutrophils/two femurs. This was accompanied by an increase in the pool of CFU-GM from a control value of 1.1 x 10(5) cells/two femurs (range 0.7 to 1.4) to 1.5 x 10(5) (1.1 to 1.9) (P less than .05) and the thymidine suicide (relative proliferative rate) of CFU-GM rose from 27% (19 to 42) to 51% (31 to 61) (P less than .05). Furthermore, the CFU-GM of infected young mice displayed enhanced differentiation to the neutrophil series. In contrast, old mice exhibited a greater mean diminution of the NSP: 12.8 x 10(6) neutrophils. Also, old mice experienced a reduction in CFU-GM from 2.3 x 10(5) (1.0 to 3.9) (controls) to 1.3 x 10(5) (1.2 to 1.5)/two femurs (P less than .05), a reduction in the proliferation of CFU-GM and reduced differentiation of CFU-GM to neutrophils. These experiments establish that the neutrophil response of infected old mice is disordered, with exaggerated depletion of the NSP and lack of stimulus-driven granulocytopoiesis as reflected by a paradoxical reduction in the number and proliferative rate of precursors. This defect may be compounded by decreased differentiation of precursors to neutrophils.\r"

In both rodents and humans, the attachment of lymphocytes to the HEVs of peripheral lymph nodes (PNs) on the one hand and gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) on the other appears to involve discrete adhesive structures on the surfaces of the interacting cells. In rodents, we previously showed that a carbohydrate-binding receptor at the lymphocyte surface participates in the attachment to the HEV of peripheral nodes. The studies reported herein document the involvement of a similar receptor in the selective attachment of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to the HEVs of PNs. We argue that the close functional relationship between the human and rodent receptors indicates that this component of the adhesive interaction has been conserved through evolution.\r"

Growth factor production was dose-related to the number of in vitro cultured cells and detectable at 6 hours using high cell concentrations. A small number of admixed normal T cells was not important for factor production. No growth of autologous B-CLL or allogeneic thymocytes was induced by the factor. A chromatographic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and inhibition experiments with a polyclonal rabbit anti interleukin 1 (IL 1) antiserum indicated that the B-CLL-derived growth factor belonged to the IL 1 family. This was supported by the direct demonstration of IL 1 beta in supernatants from B-CLL by radioimmunoassay. Possible biologic implications for B-CLL-derived IL 1 are discussed in relation to tumor cell growth in different clinical stages.\r"

  ".W": "The biologic activity of human biosynthetic granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was investigated in serum-free culture of erythroid progenitors derived from adult peripheral blood. The morphology of erythroid bursts and the cloning efficiency of BFU-E under serum-free conditions were similar to those observed in dishes with fetal bovine serum (FBS). For these experiments, progenitor cells were partially purified by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation, adherence to a plastic surface, and complement-mediated cytotoxicity of Leu-1+ elements. For some studies, blastlike cells were harvested directly from 6-day-old semisolid cultures. In serum-free culture of the light-density cell fraction, biosynthetic erythropoietin (Ep) was sufficient for formation of pure and mixed erythroid colonies whereas GM-CSF was required for granulocyte-monocytic colonies. When adherent and Leu-1+ cells were removed, or when in vitro differentiated blast cells were used as a source of progenitors, neither Ep or GM-CSF alone induced colony formation. In dishes supplemented with both growth factors, erythroid bursts were detected. Although the presence of GM-CSF alone did not induce formation of any colony or clusters, BFU-E were recorded when Ep was added 8 days later, suggesting that BFU-E could be maintained. Terminal maturation of the resulting erythroid bursts was delayed by 8 days. These results provide evidence that GM-CSF acts directly on early erythroid progenitors. Furthermore, they suggest that both Ep and GM-CSF are necessary to start the differentiation process.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is often followed by significant morbidity and mortality due to protracted immunodeficiency. We have hypothesized that the bone marrow-ablative regimen may delay the recovery of normal immune function following transplantation by impairing the interaction of host endothelial cells with circulating graft-derived lymphocytes. This report compares the relative effects of busulfan (an alkylating drug) and gamma-irradiation on the tissue-specific localization potential of lymphocytes and the eventual recovery of immune function within syngeneic murine transplant recipients. Localization of normal lymphocytes into peripheral lymph nodes of irradiated BMT recipients was markedly less (less than 50%) than in busulfan-treated or normal mice over the first 2 months post-BMT. This finding correlated with irradiation-induced endothelial cell edema and microvascular occlusions within lymphocyte-receptive areas of the nodal microvasculature. The effect of both preparative regimens on the recovery of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) was also analyzed. This response recovered more quickly (between 1 and 2 months) in busulfan-pretreated animals. Further experiments demonstrated that the decrease in CHS responsiveness appeared, in part, related to a depression in the capacity of lymphocytes to localize into skin sites of antigen deposition within irradiated mice. The impairment of tissue-specific lymphocyte localization may represent a novel mechanism by which whole body irradiation can contribute to delayed immunologic reconstitution following bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Factor VIIa participates in blood clotting by activating factor X and/or factor IX by limited proteolysis. The proteolytic activity of factor VIIa is absolutely dependent on a lipoprotein cofactor designated tissue factor. We have examined the ability of purified preparations of human plasma high density, low density and very low density lipoproteins, as well as apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, to inhibit the factor VIIa-tissue factor mediated activation of either factor X or factor IX before and after treatment of the lipoprotein preparation with polyclonal antibody directed against partially-purified human plasma extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI). In the absence of anti-EPI IgG, HDL, LDL, VLDL, and apolipoprotein A-II noncompetitively inhibited factor X activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor with apparent Ki values of 3.39 mumol/L, 124 nmol/L, 33 nmol/L, and 10.5 mumol/L, respectively. Apolipoprotein A-I had no effect on this reaction. The inhibitory activity of HDL, LDL, VLDL, and apolipoprotein A-II in this reaction was unaffected by the presence of high levels of anti-EPI IgG. In the absence of exogenous factor Xa, none of the lipoproteins studied inhibited the activation of factor IX using the tritiated peptide release assay. In the presence of added factor Xa (1 nmol/L), LDL and VLDL, but not HDL and apolipoprotein A-II, inhibited the activation of factor IX by factor VIIa-tissue factor. This inhibition was completely blocked by prior incubation of the lipoprotein with anti-EPI IgG indicating association of EPI with these particles. Taken collectively, our data indicate that HDL, LDL, and VLDL, at or below their plasma concentration, each selectively inhibits the factor VIIa-tissue factor mediated activation of factor X by a mechanism that appears to be distinct from extrinsic pathway inhibitor. These lipoproteins may not only play a role in the regulation of extrinsic blood coagulation, but may also selectively promote the activation of factor IX by factor VIIa-tissue factor in vivo at low tissue factor concentrations.\r"

Two groups of patients receiving HLA-identical marrow grafts from sex mismatched siblings were included in the study: the first group (eight patients) received conventional marrow grafts and the second group (ten patients) received stromal cell and T cell depleted grafts. All patients showed hematopoietic engraftment with donor cells. Marrow aspirates obtained from these patients were used to establish stromal layers in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) for 4 to 6 weeks. In both groups, karyotype analysis of nonhematopoietic cultured stromal cells showed host origin even as late as day 760 posttransplantation. Immunofluorescence methods using monoclonal antibodies against components of fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells, showed that the composition of stromal layers was similar to those obtained from normal controls. Our data indicate that marrow stromal progenitors capable of proliferation are nontransplantable and do not originate from a hematopoietic-stromal common progenitor.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-three consecutive, previously untreated patients who had metastatic breast cancer were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC). They were randomly assigned to receive nonspecific immunotherapy with a heptavalent pseudomonas vaccine. Sixty-five patients were treated with pseudomonas vaccine, whereas 68 did not receive immunotherapy. In addition, all patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors or tumors with an estrogen receptor status were also treated with tamoxifen. To allow clinical assessment of hormone sensitivity in vivo, tamoxifen was started 6 weeks before chemotherapy except in patients who had life-threatening disease. After the initial 6 weeks of tamoxifen, 3% of patients had achieved a complete remission, 9% a partial remission, while 16% achieved a minor response. The maximum response after tamoxifen and chemotherapy included complete remissions in 20% of patients and partial remissions in 61% of patients for an overall remission rate of 81%. The median response duration was 15 months, and the median survival time, 27 months. There were no differences in remission rate, remission duration, or survival time between the groups treated with or without pseudomonas vaccine. Eleven patients with limited metastatic disease received radiotherapy consolidation to initially involved sites. In these patients the median time from radiotherapy to progression of disease was 33 months, and the median survival time was 46 months. We conclude that nonspecific immunotherapy with pseudomonas vaccine failed to increase remission rate or survival time. Furthermore, the addition of tamoxifen to FAC chemotherapy did not improve the remission rate or duration compared to a recent, historical control group of patients treated with only FAC chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The deletion of blood group ABO antigen expression in bladder carcinoma has attracted attention because of its potential as a prognostic parameter. Based on recently produced monoclonal antibodies against blood group antigens, it has become possible to elucidate the carcinoma-associated modulation of these antigens at a molecular level. In this study we have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (H, Lea, Leb, A, ALeb) that are specific to type 1 chain structures. By the use of an immunohistochemical method, the histologic and cytologic location of these antigens in the urothelium was studied in 25 biopsies from transitional cell carcinomas and compared to 21 previously examined normal biopsies. Urothelial blood group reactivity was compared to Lewis and secretor status. The authors found a series of events associated with neoplastic progression of noninvasive urothelium: a disruption of the orderly stratification of blood group antigens in different cell layers; cytostructural relocation of cytoplasmic antigens to the cell surface; loss of correlation between urothelial blood group antigens and secretor status; and gradual deletion of antigens. In the invasive tissue these events were followed by a total deletion of A and H isoantigens and uniform expression of Lewis b and sialyted Lewis a antigen. These findings indicate that there is a complex modulation of blood group antigen biosynthesis associated with the neoplastic progression of the human urothelium.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining of these tumor markers revealed that these proteins were present in different cells. The pattern of lectin affinity electrophoresis of AFP resembled that of hepatocellular carcinoma. Also investigated was the reactivity of serum CEA to monoclonal antibodies against peptide or sugar moieties. Serum CEA values measured by antipeptide monoclonal antibodies were higher than those measured by antisugar monoclonal antibodies. The demonstration of AFP, CEA, and hCG in different tumor cells suggests that three genomes were not reactivated together in a cell, and the lung carcinoma probably consisted of at least three clones of cancer cells with different phenotypes.\r"

In contrast to the much younger age range of patients with ovarian hepatoid yolk sac tumors, the ages of the five patients with hepatoid carcinomas ranged from 42 to 78 (average, 63 years), and none of them had gonadal dysgenesis or recognizable germ cell components within their tumors. All the tumors presented as adnexal masses; in four cases they were Stage III and in one case, Stage IIB; this last tumor spread to the upper abdomen within 4 years. In three cases the clinical course and pathology findings indicated that the tumor had originated in the ovary; in the remaining two cases the tumors were interpreted as only probably primary in the ovary. Hepatoid carcinomas must be distinguished from other ovarian neoplasms, especially from hepatoid yolk sac tumors.\r"

Data were obtained primarily from the published abstracts. The major observations from the study are as follows. First, trials in cancer research are published in an extraordinarily wide range of journals covering most of the major medical specialties in addition to the many cancer specialty journals. Second, randomization is now used quite extensively. It is the predominant method of control in chemotherapy trials and in trials reported in cancer journals. However, its use is much less common in other specialties, especially surgery, so efforts to popularize randomization in these specialties would be beneficial. Third, sample sizes are highly variable, and the median sample size (96 patients) is too small to reliably detect and evaluate moderate treatment advances. Finally, our survey reveals that published trials show an inordinately large proportion of breakthroughs in treatment compared with the generally accepted view that only slow progress is being made in developing effective cancer treatments. Our view is that this result reflects the strong tendency to publish only studies with positive results. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in nonrandom trials there tend to be more positive conclusions and an absence of a strong association between conclusions and sample size.\r"

  ".W": "Combinations of metoclopramide and dexamethasone given intravenously control vomiting caused by high doses of cisplatin. Lorazepam and diphenhydramine are useful adjuncts to antiemetics. In a double-blind trial, 120 patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (120 mg/m2) for the first time were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (1.5 mg/m2) or diphenhydramine (50 mg) intravenously, 45 minutes prior to cisplatin. In addition, all patients received intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg) 40 minutes prior to chemotherapy along with metoclopramide (3 mg/kg) 30 minutes before and 90 minutes after cisplatin. Patients were directly observed in the hospital after cisplatin administration and completed a subjective assessment questionnaire. Overall, 60% of patients experienced no vomiting, and 83% had two or fewer emetic episodes during the study. There were no significant differences in objective antiemetic control between the two regimens. Only 3% of patients receiving lorazepam experienced treatment-related restlessness as opposed to 19% given diphenhydramine (P = 0.007). Less recall of chemotherapy administration (P less than 0.001), more sedation (P = 0.003), and transient enuresis while sedated (P = 0.0002) were characteristic of patients receiving lorazepam. Patient-generated ratings revealed less anxiety (P = 0.0001) for those individuals given the lorazepam-containing combination. Both regimens were well accepted, with 89% of patients receiving the lorazepam combination and 83% of those given the diphenhydramine regimen wishing to receive the same drugs in the future. Some degree of delayed vomiting occurred in 85% of patients during the 4-day period following this study. During the time that patients are at the greatest risk for emesis, the 24 hours immediately following cisplatin, three drug antiemetic combinations of either lorazepam or diphenhydramine with metoclopramide plus dexamethasone stopped cisplatin-induced emesis for the majority of patients and lessen other treatment-related side effects. Less restlessness and anxiety were observed among individuals receiving the lorazepam-containing combination.\r"

All patients had dominant skeletal disease and were on stable systemic treatment (cytotoxic or hormonal) for a least 6 months before the first response evaluation. Bone pain correlated poorly with treatment response. Changes in sclerotic metastases did not show any apparent relation to changes in lytic lesions. A correlation between bone scans and lytic activity on radiographs was found. The absolute level of biochemical bone markers did not correlate with treatment response, but seemed instead to reflect the rate of bone turnover. The relative level of bone markers with respect to baseline showed better correlation to treatment response. The best conventional marker of disease activity was urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine. Propeptide of Type III procollagen (PIIINP), a novel marker reflecting collagen turnover, promises to be at least as sensitive as hydroxyproline. Stable and regressing patients had the same prognosis and significantly longer survival than progressors.\r"

The former included 15 follicular center cell lymphomas (FCCL), four intermediately differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (ILL), four mantle zone lymphomas (MZL), and five well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (WDLL). In controls, DRC-1+ and OKB7+ DRC were localized in both follicular centers (FC) and mantle zones (MZ), but BA-2+ and Leu-M3+ DRC were confined to FC only. FCCL were usually accompanied by DRC-1+, OKB7+, and BA-2+ DRC, and either lost or maintained positively with Leu-M3 from case to case. By contrast, MZL consistently lacked BA-2+ and Leu-M3+ DRC, and was associated with DRC-1+ and OKB7+ DRC only. Desmoplakin-positive DRC occurred in variable proportions in both FCCL and MZL. As opposed to FCCL and MZL, all WDLL and all but one of the ILL (associated only with DRC-1+, OKB7+, and desmoplakin+ DRC) did not show any DRC as identifiable with the antibody panel used. Remarkably, the difference in the distribution of BA-2+ and Leu-M3+ DRC in the normal FC and MZ appears to be maintained in their neoplastic counterparts (FCCL and MZL) also. Such a difference represents an example of the possible interactions between lymphoma cells of different phenotype and their microenvironment, as portrayed by phenotypically heterogeneous DRC.\r"

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that these MoAbs recognize the filamentous components of cytoplasm which were protein in nature. While the pattern of antigen distribution in various cell lines was not cell-type specific, reactivity of these antibodies with tissue sections was informative. MoAb 1H5 was preferentially reactive with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, however, reaction with adenocarcinoma was observed infrequently. This antibody also preferentially reacted with the spinous layer of normal stratified squamous epithelium. MoAb B10, however, was reactive with nonepithelial tissues as well as with epithelial ones, and its level of binding bore no relationship to the grade of histologic malignancy. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis, using cytokeratin extracts of Ueda-1 cells and human epidermis, demonstrated that MoAb B10 reacted with a wide range of keratin proteins of 65-67K, 58K, 56.5K, 56K, 52K, 50K, 48K, 45K, 40K, 38K, 36K, and 34K molecular weight (MW), while MoAb 1H5 reacted with keratin proteins of 65-67K, 58K, 56.5K, 56K, 52K, 48K, and 34K MW. These results suggest that MoAb 1H5 may recognize keratin subfamilies related to squamous differentiation, whereas MoAb B10 recognizes a wide range of keratin proteins, and may even react with other kinds of intermediate filament proteins (IFPs).\r"

In this case amyloid deposits were seen in the breast tumor. In six cases, focal infiltration of ductal/lobular epithelium by lymphoma cells was found. This so-called lymphoepithelial lesion appears to be an important characteristic of various mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas which have been described in different extranodal sites (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract). They may show different behavior from nodal counterparts, especially in terms of their spread to other mucosal sites which may appear before or without nodal dissemination. The breast appears to be yet another location for these lymphomas.\r"

Currently, it is unclear whether FL-HCC rarely arises in preexisting FNH, or whether FNH is a typical response to this vascular variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The FNH region, which is peripheral, may be biopsied to exclude the underlying carcinoma, and thus lead to inadequate therapy. Previous reports of this association are reviewed.\r"

This is despite the fact that it has not been conclusively shown that the use of test doses improve the safety margin of epidural anaesthesia, when administered by a competent person, with the proper resuscitative equipment immediately available. Until a controlled study is performed, test doses should be done for continuous epidural anaesthesia with the understanding that they are neither 100 per cent sensitive nor specific in preventing complications. It is however one more manoeuvre that may be useful in recognizing some of the patients with accidental subarachnoid placement of epidural catheters. The literature suggests that lidocaine 1.5 per cent in dextrose 7.5 per cent should be the test dose of choice in obstetric epidural anaesthesia in an amount known to produce spinal anaesthesia (30-50 mg). The use of epinephrine in test doses in unpremedicated healthy women in active labour is neither sensitive nor specific in signalling intravascular injection, and it may also be detrimental to fetal wellbeing. Epinephrine 15 micrograms as a test dose for intravenous injection appears to create more problems than it solves.\r"

The study involved 4 groups: control Wistar rats, nondiabetic littermates of \"BB\" Wistar rats, insulin-treated diabetic \"BB\" rats, and diabetic \"BB\" rats in which insulin treatment was removed 24 hours prior to study (uncontrolled diabetes). Hearts were perfused for 30 minutes as isolated working hearts in perfusate containing 1.2 mM (1-14C)-palmitate bound to 3% albumin, and 11 mM glucose. Palmitate oxidative rates, calculated as micromoles palmitate oxidized per gram dry weight per minute, were significantly decreased in both diabetic groups (0.447 +/- 0.043 and 0.528 +/- 0.038 in uncontrolled diabetic and treated diabetic versus 0.584 +/- 0.032 and 0.629 +/- 0.033 in nondiabetic littermate and control rats, respectively). This decrease was accompanied, however, by a significant decrease in the heart rate of these 2 groups when compared with control or nondiabetic animals. If the decreased heart function in the diabetic animals was accounted for, no decrease in palmitate oxidative rates occurred, suggesting that fatty acid oxidative metabolism is not impaired in the diabetic myocardium. In the uncontrolled diabetic rats, an increased rate of palmitate incorporation into myocardial triglycerides was seen compared with treated diabetic, nondiabetic littermates, and control rats (8.5 +/- 0.3 mumol/g dry wt/30 min versus 4.8 +/- 0.3, 5.9 +/- 0.7, and 5.7 +/- 0.3, respectively). Myocardial levels of coenzyme A were elevated in the uncontrolled diabetic rats compared with all other groups (647 +/- 25 nmol/g dry wt versus 484 +/- 27, 508 +/- 56, and 534 +/- 9, in treated diabetic, nondiabetic, and control rats, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two types of myosin heavy chain isozymes, alpha-type and beta-type, were fractionated by affinity chromotography using monoclonal antibodies CMA19 and HMC50, which are specific for the alpha-type heavy chain and beta-type heavy chain, respectively. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that the content of beta-type in the atrioventricular node (30-40%) was higher than that in atrial ordinary myocardium (10-20%) and that of the alpha-type was 30-40% in the ventricular conduction system, which was much higher than that in the ventricular ordinary myocardium (less than 10%). By one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis of the peptides produced by partial and complete digestion, the peptide compositions of alpha-type and beta-type in the conduction system were shown to be very similar to those of alpha-type and beta-type in ordinary myocardium, respectively. The CA2+-activated ATPase activity of myosin of the atrioventricular nodes was lower than that of ordinary atrial myosin (0.46 +/- 0.03 versus 0.58 +/- 0.02 mumol Pi/mg/min, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) and in contrast, that of ventricular specialized myocardium was higher than that of myosin in the ventricular ordinary working myocardium (0.32 +/- 0.03 versus 0.22 +/- 0.01 mumol Pi/mg/min, p less than 0.05). This was in good agreement with the relative proportion of myosin isozymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anti-light chain recognizes the proteins in all 4 light chain spots. Complete dephosphorylation of light chain in muscle homogenate, by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase and by adding phosphatase, leads to 2 spots on two-dimensional gel electrophoretograms; both spots are visible on immunoblots. Stimulation (K+ or stretch) of smooth muscle results in increased light chain phosphorylation. Autoradiography of the gel electrophoretograms reveals that radioactive components are contained in spots 3, 2, 1, and in an additional spot with lower isoelectric point, referred to as spot 0. Phosphoamino acid analysis shows that spots 3 and 1 contain phosphoserine, whereas spots 2 and 0 contain phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the trypsin-digested proteins from spots 3 and 1 shows predominantly 2 peptides; whereas from spots 2 and 0, it shows 5 peptides. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the phosphopeptides obtained with Staphylococcus aureus V8 digestion gives identical maps for spots 3 and 2, which are different from the identical maps of spots 1 and 0. The results suggest that arterial smooth muscle myosin contains 2 nonphosphorylated 20,000-dalton light chain isoforms with different amino acid sequences and that each isoform can be mono- and diphosphorylated.\r"

These results were related to myosin isozyme composition measured in ventricles by native gel electrophoresis and by quantitative immunocytochemistry. Both total ATPase activity and percent alpha-heavy chain rapidly rise during the first month following birth. However, ATPase activity remains constant at a high level from 1 to 12 months following birth, even though percent alpha-heavy chain declines during this period. The ATPase activity of V1 myosin was specifically determined using sections in which V3 myosin had been completely inhibited by exposure to alkaline pH in the absence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Relative V1 specific activity, taken as the ratio of V1 ATPase activity to percent alpha-heavy chain, doubles in the first 2.0 months after birth and then remains approximately constant at this higher level until at least 4 months after birth. The specific activity of V1 can be further increased by the addition of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). This effect of cAMP is age dependent, increasing threefold between 1 and 2 months following birth and then declining as V1 is replaced by V3.\r"

A highly significant (chi 2= 706, 2 degrees of freedom) seasonal effect, 7.4 mg/dl higher on December 30 than on June 30, was found. This effect was similar among the 12 LRC centers, including such disparate climates as those of Minneapolis and San Diego, and tended to be larger in the southern centers. Its magnitude was independent of baseline levels of plasma cholesterol and other baseline characteristics. Observed seasonal differences in weight and diet explained less than one-third of the seasonal variation in plasma cholesterol levels. Plasma low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, analyzed similarly, also showed significant synchronous seasonal cycles. Plasma triglyceride levels showed a weaker irregular seasonal pattern, highest in midsummer and late autumn and lowest in spring. The etiologies and mechanisms for these seasonal patterns remain largely unknown.\r"

Duration of each treatment was 6 weeks and the dose of enoximone was 150 mg tid. Efficacy was assessed by exercise tolerance, symptoms, radionuclide angiography for ejection fraction at rest and during exercise, and Holter monitoring. Two patients were withdrawn before completion of the study, one with pulmonary edema after 1 week on placebo and the other for noncompliance with enoximone therapy. Symptom-limited exercise capacity improved with enoximone by 30% and 43% (p less than .01) compared with baseline after 2 and 6 weeks treatment, respectively. Ejection fraction improved at rest (p less than .02) with enoximone but not with placebo. No change was found during exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure remained unaltered. During treatment with enoximone symptoms of exertional dyspnea and fatigue were improved and NYHA class decreased by at least one class for every patient. Holter monitoring revealed an overall increase (NS) in ectopic activity during enoximone therapy. There were no serious adverse effects and laboratory values did not change significantly. The addition of enoximone to the existing therapy of patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure provided clear and sustained subjective and objective benefit when compared with placebo.\r"

It reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion at doses between 0.025 and 0.5 microgram/kg/min and the antihypertensive effect was sustained during 2 hr infusions. In 10 patients studied during free-water diuresis, fenoldopam increased renal plasma flow by 42%, glomerular filtration rate by 6%, and sodium excretion by 202%, while lowering mean arterial pressure by 12% (all p less than .05). Similar promotion of sodium excretion was observed during blood pressure reduction in six additional patients studied without water loading.

All patients had a Glasgow coma scale score of 12 or less. Patients in the control group (n = 101) received standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) care. Patients in the pacing group (n = 101) were to receive PACE in addition to standard ACLS treatment; 89 patients were actually paced. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, presenting rhythm, and mean times to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and ACLS. For the 144 patients in whom the time of arrest could be estimated, the mean times to CPR and ACLS were 5.3 +/- 4.0 and 10.9 +/- 7.1 min, respectively. For the 65 paced patients in whom the time of arrest could be estimated, the mean time from arrest to pacing was 21.8 +/- 8.8 min (range 2 to 43). Multivariate analysis of outcome variables (presentation to emergency department with a pulse, admission to the hospital, and discharge from the hospital) revealed that an initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and a short time to ACLS were correlated with a favorable outcome (p less than .05; logistic regression analysis). A short time to PACE was associated with admission to the hospital (p = .20; logistic regression analysis). The use of a stand-alone transcutaneous pacing device in the prehospital arrest setting was associated with generally long times until pacing and did not appreciably improve outcome. Use of PACE in patients demonstrating prehospital bradycardia without neurologic impairment remains to be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "A technique was developed for measuring regional myocardial perfusion by intracoronary infusions of hydrogen (H2)-saturated saline. H2 concentration was detected during washout in the pulmonary artery by means of the voltage response of a platinum-tipped electrode. Regional myocardial perfusion was calculated from the H2 exponential desaturation curve according to the Kety-Schmidt principle. In 16 anesthetized open-chest dogs, validation of this technique was performed at baseline, reduced (stenosis), and hyperemic (dipyridamole) flow states by means of the radionuclide-labeled microsphere reference withdrawal technique. There was an excellent quadratic correlation between microsphere and H2 washout techniques (range 0.11 to 3.15 ml/min/g) (n = 33, r = .92, y = -0.12x2 + 0.89x + 0.20, SEE = 0.20 ml/min/g; p less than .0001). Hyperemic regional myocardial perfusion was underestimated by H2 washout and severely ischemic regional myocardial perfusion was overestimated. When regional myocardial perfusion values greater than twice normal were excluded, a strong linear correlation was present between H2 and microsphere measurements (n = 27, r = .89, y = 0.76x + 0.22, SEE = 0.18 ml/min/g; p less than .0001). The H2 washout method was further tested in 18 additional open chest dogs for calculations of the mass of an arterial perfusion bed according to the principle that the mass of the bed (g) equals coronary blood flow (ml/min) divided by regional myocardial perfusion (ml/min/g).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exercise testing has assumed a position of growing importance in the assessment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The hemodynamic and neurohumoral adjustments that occur during dynamic exercise are very complex, but are basically designed to ensure that oxygen delivery is commensurate with oxygen demand. These responses are clearly altered in the presence of certain types of heart disease. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure have an attenuated heart rate and blood pressure response throughout exercise, but this is most clearly evident when the data are expressed as a percent of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) rather than as a function of absolute VO2. Likewise, the sympathetic response to exercise is altered in patients with heart failure. Plasma norepinephrine is normally augmented as a function of VO2 during exercise, but this augmentation occurs during the later stages (beyond 50% of peak VO2). Patients with congestive heart failure show a greater than normal augmentation of plasma norepinephrine during exercise when the data are expressed in terms of absolute VO2. However, when the data are expressed as a percent of peak VO2, there appears to be a relative attenuation of the sympathetic response to exercise. Current information suggests that increased plasma norepinephrine and renin activity during exercise in patients with heart failure are not directly related to a decrement in nutritive blood flow to skeletal muscles. The mechanisms responsible for exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure are not known, but do not seem directly related to a decrement in cardiac output or an increase in left ventricular filling pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88053266\r", 
  ".W": "During exercise, the level of oxygen consumption (VO2) above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis is termed the anaerobic threshold. The VO2 at which the anaerobic threshold occurs is influenced by the factors that affect oxygen delivery to the tissues, being increased when oxygen flow is enhanced and decreased when oxygen flow is diminished. The anaerobic threshold is an important functional demarcation since the physiologic responses to exercise are different above the anaerobic threshold as compared with below the anaerobic threshold. Above the anaerobic threshold, in addition to the development of metabolic acidosis, exercise endurance is reduced, VO2 kinetics are slowed so that a steady state is delayed, and minute ventilation increases disproportionately to the metabolic requirement and a progressive tachypnea develops. The anaerobic threshold can be measured directly from lactate concentration with good threshold detection from a log-log transformation of lactate and VO2. This threshold defines the VO2 at which the lactate/pyruvate ratio increases. As bicarbonate changes reciprocally with lactate, its measurement can also be used to estimate the lactate threshold. But most conveniently, changes in gas exchange caused by the physical-chemical event of buffering of lactic acid by bicarbonate can be used to detect the anaerobic threshold during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Engagement in muscular exercise involves complex local and nervous adjustments of the circulation. In the active muscles, including cardiac muscle, the resistance vessels relax in response to local chemical changes to provide an increase in blood flow adequate for their metabolic requirements. There is increased release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve endings as a result of increased sympathetic outflow; the resultant alpha-receptor activation leads to constriction of both systemic resistance and capacitance vessels outside the active muscles, and the beta-receptor activation leads to an increase in heart rate, shortening of the refractory period, and enhancement of myocardial contractility. As a consequence, the filling pressure of the heart and arterial blood pressure are maintained, and the increase in left ventricular output is directed primarily to the active muscles. During upright exercise, the action of the leg muscle pump contributes to the maintenance of the cardiac filling pressure. As exercise continues and body temperature rises, the skin flow increases to dissipate heat from the body. Static exercise causes a greater increase in arterial blood pressure than dynamic exercise. This is due to the combination of an increase in cardiac output and in total systemic vascular resistance as a consequence of increase sympathetic outflow and mechanical compression of the vessels in the active muscles. The hemodynamic changes result from activation of ergoreceptors in the contracted muscles and from central command. The increase in pressure helps to oppose the mechanical compression. The arterial baroreceptors are reset so that they operate normally around the higher blood pressure.\r"

Moreover, this noninvasive variable predicts the exercise cardiac output response and thereby the cardiac reserve. The lactate or anaerobic threshold has been validated in these patients from the response of mixed venous lactate to incremental exercise and has been shown to be another objective measure of the severity of chronic cardiac or circulatory failure. The anaerobic threshold can be reliably assessed from the response in breath-by-breath respiratory gas exchange by the use of multiple criteria, several of which can be monitored during the exercise test itself and the remainder of which can be measured during the recovery period. We find the breath-by-breath monitoring of respiratory gas exchange and air flow to provide the best means of assessing the anaerobic threshold and for identifying the plateau in VO2, or VO2max, in response to incremental treadmill exercise.\r"

Manometric studies were performed using a sensitive computer-directed microvolume flow system. Osteocyte viability within the femoral head was assessed by counting empty osteocyte lacunae in five random high-power fields of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. There was no significant elevation of intramedullary pressure or venous outflow resistance in femoral heads of animals receiving steroids, and a significant random loss of osteocytes was observed in these femoral heads. The clinical relevance of these studies is as follows. NON associated with steroids may not simply be the result of progressive ischemia. Ischemia and elevated intramedullary pressure may be epiphenomena, and a direct cytotoxic effect of steroids on osteocytes may be the earliest event in the development of nontraumatic osteonecrosis. The stress test, as it is currently being used in the clinical setting, may be unreliable.\r"

The bony environment surrounding a loosened cemented prosthesis is an abnormal pathologic condition which, if left unattended, will progress to a total failure of the joint including an inhibition of function and immobilizing pain. That biomaterial properties of the cement used for fixation also contribute to the pathologic state separates this disease from other modes of loosening. This leads inevitably to the conclusion that \"cement disease\" does exist. Methyl methacrylate has revolutionized the treatment of severe joint dysfunction. There can be no doubt that improving surgical technique, cement handling, and the cement itself will continue to improve the results and reduce the incidence of failure due to loosening. Cement is undoubtedly satisfactory for elderly patients with low activity levels and relatively short life expectancies. However, because of the inherent biologic and biomechanical properties of methyl methacrylate, it is unlikely that it can be rendered satisfactory in the long run for the young, the active, or the overweight patient, for whom alternatives are currently being sought. In such cases, the elimination of \"cement disease\" can only occur with the elimination of cement. Alternatives include the search for other grouting materials and the development of prostheses with satisfactory surfaces for either press-fit or biologic ingrowth.\r"

The use of a fixation technique that suited the method of bone repair, i.e., autografts, allografts, or a combination of the two, was all-important. Cement technique alone was generally used when bone stock was intact and healthy. Cement was also used in combination with protrusio screens and allografts for gross acetabular deficiencies. Cementless, porous ingrowth technique, together with autografts, was preferred for femoral deficiencies or minor acetabular deficiencies. Bipolar prostheses with compressed, fragmented allografts were used as salvage procedures in gross acetabular deficiencies in older patients, especially when the femoral component did not need to be exchanged.\r"

The following complications occurred with allograft revisions: dislocation, wound hematoma, joint instability, nonunion, implant failure, and acetabular loosening. Nine patients required additional surgical procedures. There have been no infections or rapid lysis indicative of an allograft rejection phenomenon. The 73% success at the two-year postoperative interval of incorporation of freeze-dried allografts for salvage situations has been encouraging.

Initially, some definitions of skeletal tissues and cells are presented to illustrate the nontrivial problem of how to tell whether cells are capable of becoming osteoblasts or chondroblasts and of depositing bone or cartilage. This leads to a discussion of the best criteria to use to identify differentiating osteogenic and chondrogenic cells. Cytodifferentiation is immediately preceded by the appearance of the membranous skeleton, consisting of the mesenchymal condensations in which bone and cartilage will develop. Condensation formation in normal development and defective condensations leading to abnormal skeletogenesis are related to cellular properties of mesenchymal cells. The remainder of the review is on the development of membrane bone in the craniofacial skeleton, subperiosteal bone in embryonic avian long bones, and subperiosteal and endochondral bone in developing mammalian long bones. In each case the emphasis is on the embryologic origins of the skeletogenic cells, cell migration, and the factors and influences involved in the initiation of cell differentiation. The relevance of developing systems to clinical practice is stressed throughout.\r"

  ".U": "88053605\r", 
  ".W": "Frederic Jay Cotton (Fig. 1) was born in Prescott, Wisconsin, and educated at Harvard. After postgraduate study in New York and in Europe, he returned to Boston where he had an association with most of the important hospitals. In addition to great surgical talent, he also was an able administrator and medical politician. He is remembered primarily for his work on fractures, which is summarized in his book, Dislocations and Joint Fractures. The two editions of this book were illustrated by many of the author's own drawings. Cotton was a founder of the American College of Surgeons and served as Regent of the College as well as on the Committee on Fractures. He served in both the Spanish American War and World War I. In the summer of 1918, he was the Chief of Surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. This article on \"Artificial Impaction in Hip Fracture\" is an example of the application of a clinical observation to the development of an improvement in the care of patients. It had been known for a long time that impacted fractures of the neck of the femur healed, while displaced fractures did not. Cotton was the first to suggest that impaction, after reduction of the fracture, would be of value. Cotton published three additional papers on the use of impaction in the treatment of hip fractures, the last in 1938, the year of his death. Impaction of fractures of the neck of the femur after reduction of the displacement was rapidly incorporated into all of the procedures for internal fixation of such injuries.\r"

This balance may be profoundly affected by the intrauterine environment. Without treatment, it is uncertain how many dysplastic, unstable hips will retain their dysplastic features throughout life. The natural history of untreated complete dislocation varies considerably and is affected by societal considerations. There may be little, if any, functional disability in many cases. Significant roentgenographic degenerative disease and poor clinical results, however, may develop in completely dislocated hips with well developed false acetabulae. In unilateral cases, ipsilateral knee deformity and pain may develop. Congenital subluxations have a particularly poor long-term outcome. A significant percentage of these patients have roentgenographic degenerative joint disease and clinical disability. The age of symptom onset and roentgenographic degenerative joint disease is related to the amount of subluxation and dysplasia. The natural history of acetabular dysplasia in the absence of subluxation is difficult to predict. Physical signs may be absent, and the diagnosis only established with symptom onset or as an incidental roentgenographic finding. While degenerative joint disease may ensue, current roentgenographic parameters are not predictive.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical outcome of bone grafting procedures depends on many factors, including type and fixation of the bone graft as well as the site and status of the host bed. Bone grafts serve one or both of two main functions, as a source of osteogenetic cells and as a mechanical support. Autografts, both cancellous and cortical, are usually implanted fresh and are often osteogenetic, whether by providing a source of osteoprogenitor cells or by being osteoinductive. The latter is a process whereby the transplanted tissue induces mesenchymal cells of the recipient to differentiate into osteoblastic cells. Cortical grafts, whether autogeneic or allogeneic, at least initially act as weight-bearing space fillers or struts. All bone grafts are initially resorbed, but cancellous grafts are completely replaced in time by creeping substitution, while cortical grafts remain an admixture of necrotic and viable bone for a prolonged period of time. The three-dimensional framework, which supports invasion of the bone grafts by capillaries and osteoprogenitor cells, termed \"osteoconduction\", is another important function of both autografts and allografts. Fresh allografts are more slowly and less completely replaced by host bones because they invoke both local and systemic immune responses that diminish or destroy the osteoinductive and conductive processes. Although freezing or freeze-drying of allografts improves acceptance, their failure rate is still too high. These processes are also influenced by the vascularity and composition of the host bed. Thus, the interaction of the host and the bone graft determines the success of these procedures, which ultimately is to provide a mechanically efficient support structure.\r"

The antihypertensive effect of verapamil is associated with a decreased cardiovascular pressor responsiveness to norepinephrine without changes in endogenous noradrenergic activity.

Linogliride demonstrated a significant hypoglycemic activity in 26 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus receiving 1 week of therapy. In a dose range of 150 to 400 mg b.i.d., fasting glucose levels fell from 237 +/- 52 mg to 199 +/- 59 mg by day 7 (P less than 0.01). Eight-hour glucose AUCs fell from 2121 +/- 617 mg/dl/8 hr baseline to 1781 +/- 631 mg/dl/8 hr on day 7 of treatment (P less than 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in insulin AUC from 380 +/- 327 to 610 +/- 417 on day 7 (P less than 0.01). Thus its initial action appears to be by an insulin secretagogue mechanism. No patient had any major adverse effect. This initial study indicates that linogliride fumarate is an effective hypoglycemic agent that significantly lowers fasting and postprandial glucose levels with short-term use. Linogliride fumarate represents a new group of hypoglycemic agents that may be shown to have therapeutic utility.\r"

Levels of serum uric acid, urea, and creatinine before, during, and after the treatment were measured, as well as creatinine clearance and uric acid clearance before and during the treatment. A uricosuric effect, resembling that of probenecid, was found that exerts itself in all the patients, regardless of age, sex, diagnosis, and associated drugs. The resulting hypouricemia starts as soon as 24 hours from the beginning of treatment, stabilizes within 10 days, and averages, at that time, 48% of the initial level. It is reversible within 10 days from the end of treatment.\r"

The metocurine dosage regimen was a bolus of 0.3 mg/kg given concomitantly with the commencement of an infusion at a rate of 0.04 mg/kg/hr; this regimen was designed to produce and maintain a plasma metocurine concentration associated with 95% depression of the twitch response. Metocurine kinetics were affected minimally by hypothermic CPB. The kinetic parameters including volumes of distribution at steady state of 0.35 L/kg and 0.34 L/kg and elimination clearances of 1.3 ml/min/kg and 1.1 ml/min/kg in the control and CPB groups, respectively, are in agreement with the results of others. Changes in neuromuscular blockade with the onset of CPB and the return to original blockade intensities with rewarming suggest a decreased sensitivity to the effects of metocurine at lower temperatures.\r"

Two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting confirmed that the proteins were beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and globin chains. 3. When the effluent of high-performance gel filtration chromatography corresponding to molecular masses of 10-15 kDa was subjected to Edman degradation, only one amino acid residue was found at each step.

Although globin chains were clearly present in the amyloid material, they were not accessible for sequence determination.

  ".W": "Congenital hypothyroidism is a relatively common endocrine disorder, affecting one in 4000 newborn infants. Undiagnosed and untreated congenital hypothyroidism will result in un-toward consequences, including mental retardation and other significant neurologic sequelae. For these reasons, programs to screen newborns were developed to detect congenital hypothyroidism before clinical features become obvious enough to suggest the diagnosis. The most common clinical features include prolonged jaundice, skin mottling, hypotonia, umbilical hernia, constipation, and macroglossia. Congenital hypothyroidism may be caused by several different disorders; ectopic thyroid glands represent the most common cause. There is accumulating evidence that autoimmune thyroid disease as manifested by TBII may be the cause of thyroid dysgenesis in some cases. The diagnosis is easily confirmed by finding a low serum free T4 or total T4 and elevated serum TSH concentration. The treatment of choice is levothyroxine; these infants must be followed carefully to ensure normal growth and development and maintenance of serum T4 and TSH within the normal ranges. With appropriate treatment and follow-up, the large majority of these infants have an excellent prognosis, with an IQ no different from comparison populations. However, it appears that there is still a small percentage of infants who are the most severely affected, who manifest the lowest serum T4 levels, thyroid aplasia, and retarded bone ages, and who may run the highest risk for some degree of retardation and other neurologic sequelae. Acquired hypothyroidism is also a relatively common disorder, occurring in one in 500 to one in 1000 school-age children. These children most commonly have a slowdown in growth, short stature, a goiter, and a drop in school performance. Other clinical features may be subtle or absent except in more severe or long-standing cases. The most common cause is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The diagnosis is easily established by finding low serum-free T4 or total T4 and elevated serum TSH concentrations. Again, levothyroxine is the treatment of choice. With appropriate treatment and follow-up, all clinical features that develop after age 3 should be reversible and the prognosis should therefore be very good.\r"

We must emphasize that most patients with CF and their families do make a successful psychological adjustment. Simultaneously, parents must fulfill the varied physical and psychological needs of the child. A young adult patient with CF summarizes the patient's task: \"Projecting a life goal, living it, having the goal altered by luck and by fate, accomplishing that goal, and then reflecting on what has been done. That is life. That is a life compressed for us; CF is myopic. We cannot look through the long vista of life. That is disappointing, frustrating, and cursed at. We can live now. We can do the best we can. Set goals that fit on our playing field and accomplish them.\" An emotionally adjusted family makes the patient's task possible. Achieving the goal of adequate adjustment also depends on the physician's having the medical expertise to manage this complex multisystem illness and the ability to make the medical knowledge comprehensible for patient and family.\r"

Dietary calcium supplementation in human essential hypertension appears to be an effective nonpharmacologic means of lowering blood pressure in some patients, especially those with evidence of a calcium-deficient state.
