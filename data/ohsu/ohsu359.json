As with many other plastic surgeons, early use was confined to \"salvage cases.\" Owing to the impressive results, use was extended to routine augmentation. Polyurethane implants are now used exclusively for aesthetic breast surgery. Results are evaluated for replacement of gel capsules and simple and radical mastectomy reconstruction. Gel capsules (Baker stages III to IV), in which prostheses were removed and replaced with polyurethane-covered implants, improved in 29 of 32 patients (87 percent). For reconstruction, placement of polyurethane implants in unscarred situations gives far superior results than following repeated procedures. The incidence of infection is no higher than with gel implants. Removal without capsulectomy was not a problem in most instances. However, on two recent occasions capsulectomy was extremely difficult.\r"

During the infusions, subjects rated themselves on questions that assessed their suspiciousness and paranoia, and nurse-observers took descriptive notes on the subjects' behavior; these notes were later scored on a scale for guarded, suspicious, and paranoid behavior. Nurses observed and rated moderately suspicious behavior when cocaine IV bolus loading doses were followed by cocaine infusions, but not when loading doses were followed by saline solution infusions; subjects did not rate themselves as suspicious during any of the study conditions. Suspiciousness during low-dose cocaine infusions significantly correlated with the amount of cocaine previously administered to the subjects. Suspiciousness during infusions was not related to plasma cocaine concentrations, preadmission drug use, or psychiatric symptoms and history. Cocaine infusions may be a useful tool to pursue the biology of stimulant psychoses.\r"

Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we found that increased tumor diameter, mixed or epithelioid cell type, and radiation adversely affected survival. In vivo studies of cell cycling indicated that 20 Gy of preenucleation radiation appeared to diminish the reproductive integrity of the tumor cells. It is most likely that the failure of preenucleation irradiation to prolong patient survival was because of micrometastases that occurred before treatment.\r"

In alternate, otherwise identical experiments, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, either indomethacin or meclofenamate, was also administered throughout the experiment. Increasing doses of secretin led to increasing inhibition of gastric acid output with the maximum inhibition at 1 microgram/kg.h (3.3 CU/kg.h) of secretin. Both indomethacin and meclofenamate abolished the inhibitory effects of secretin on gastric acid secretion. The inhibitors of prostaglandin generation had no effect on the serotonin system. We concluded that secretin mediates its inhibitory action on gastric acid secretion, at least in part, through endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

Also, while the simultaneous test was more sensitive, the alternate test was more specific. Using receiver-operator characteristic methodology, it was found that the ability of the alternate test to distinguish between a healthy population and a patient population was superior to that of the simultaneous test. There was no improvement in the ability to distinguish between a healthy population and a patient population when the results from the two tests were combined as compared to using the alternate caloric test alone.\r"

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with witnessed arrests were more frequently successful than efforts with unwitnessed arrests (47.7% vs 29.9%) and resulted in live discharge more often than efforts with unwitnessed arrests. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts that resulted in a live discharge were more brief and involved a lower mean number of medication doses. Of the 77 CPR efforts in patients 70 years of age or older who had arrests, 24 (31%) were successful, and in 22 (92%), patients were alive after 24 hours. None lived to discharge. There were 322 CPR efforts in the younger cohort; 137 (43%) were successful, in 124 (91%) of these 137 efforts, patients were alive after 24 hours, and in 22 (16%), patients were discharged alive. Older patients were significantly less likely to live to discharge both at the time of arrest and 24 hours after successful resuscitation. When a multivariate analysis was used, the presence of sepsis, cancer, increased age, increased number of medication doses administered, and absence of witness were all \"predictive\" of poor outcome. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be administered only to those who have the greatest potential benefit from this emotionally and physically traumatic procedure.\r"

Systolic function was normal in all but one of the patients. The mean (1SD) first one third filling fraction (a measurement of early diastolic filling) was significantly lower in the hypertensive groups (0.27 (0.24] than in the control group (0.45 (0.16)). The hypertensive group was subdivided into those with electrocardiographic abnormalities and those without. In the subgroup with a normal electrocardiogram the mean (1SD) first one third filling fraction measurement (0.28 (0.16)) was significantly lower than in the control group. In the subgroup with an abnormal electrocardiogram, the first one third filling fraction was even lower (0.24 (0.9)). In addition, the time to peak filling rate (213 (56) ms) was significantly longer in the subgroup with the abnormal electrocardiogram than in the control group (164 (45) ms). However, the interobserver reproducibility of the time to peak filling measurement was poor. The peak filling rate was low in the subgroup with an abnormal electrocardiogram, but not significantly different from the normal controls. The discriminatory value of the three diastolic measurements did not improve with exercise. These results showed an early diastolic filling abnormality in essential hypertension that did not appear to be caused by disease of the large coronary vessels as it was present in patients with normal wall motion and a normal exercise electrocardiogram. The occurrence of diastolic abnormalities when systolic function is still normal may mark an early stage in the development of hypertensive heart failure, at a time when the process is still potentially reversible.\r"

Macaque monkeys infected with SIV show profound immunological impairment, clinically characterized by multiple opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Retrospective examination of autopsy tissue from 27 SIV-infected animals demonstrated that approximately 60% of the experimentally inoculated animals had a meningoencephalitis characterized by perivascular infiltrates of macrophages and multinucleate giant cells in the white and gray matter and leptomeninges. Ultrastructurally, these macrophages contained typical lentiviral particles within membrane-bound intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Other findings in the central nervous system included discrete randomly located neuroglial nodules, endothelial hypertrophy, and leptomeningeal thickening. The results indicate tha the meningoencephalitis induced by SIV in monkeys is similar to the lesions of the central nervous system in patients with AIDS and that SIV infection in the macaque is a useful animal model to study the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus--related subacute encephalitis or AIDS encephalopathy.\r"

Twenty-five patients received khellin orally and three patients were treated with topical khellin. Treatments were given three times weekly. As opposed to psoralens, khellin did not induce skin phototoxicity with UVA but it induced repigmentation similar to psoralens. The treatment success strongly depended on the number of treatments. More than 70% repigmentation was achieved in 41% of the patients who had received 100 to 200 treatments. This success rate is comparable to the rate obtained with psoralens. Seven patients experienced a mild elevation of liver transaminases within the early treatment phase and their treatments were discontinued. No long-term internal organ or skin toxicity was observed. The major advantage of khellin is that it does not lead to phototoxic skin erythema and thus can be considered safe for home treatment. Because of its photochemistry it may be considered less hazardous than psoralens regarding mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.\r"

Cyclosporine had no effect on the toxic contact reaction in normal animals either to croton oil or to DNCB in high concentration. Cyclosporine applied topically to the challenge site also resulted in a reduction of retest and flare-up reactions of contact sensitivity to DNCB, but did not affect the production of generalized rash in the same animals. These results indicate that in the future local topical application of cyclosporine may make treatment of human cutaneous immune-mediated disorders a possibility without serious side effects.\r"

Twenty-seven pigs were used: nine as sham-operated controls, six with partial ureteral obstruction, and 12 with complete ureteral obstruction. P-31 MR spectra and Tc-DMSA scintiscans were obtained weekly over 3 weeks. Partial obstruction caused no significant change in P-31 MR spectra, whereas Tc-DMSA scintiscans showed a 74% decrease in tubular function by the end of 3 weeks. Complete obstruction caused a 43% reduction in the mean adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to inorganic phosphate (Pi) ratio, which paralleled the 96% decrease in Tc-DMSA uptake over 3 weeks. The difference in ATP/Pi ratios between control and completely obstructed kidneys was significant (P less than .01) at 2 and 3 weeks after ligation. These results indicate that radionuclide Tc-99m DMSA uptake is very sensitive to the pathophysiologic changes in renal tubular function, while the organ average cellular bioenergetic state (ATP/Pi) is not as strongly affected.\r"

Patients with multiple gestation, third trimester bleeding, polyhydramnios, or premature rupture of membranes and those already diagnosed with preterm labor were eliminated from the study. Of the 2446 remaining patients (7247 antepartum fetal heart rate tests) who went into spontaneous labor, 237 did so before 37 completed weeks of gestation, 1077 entered labor at term (38 to 42 completed weeks), and 1132 did so after 42 weeks. There was a significant increase in maximum uterine activity per 10-minute window from 30 to 44 weeks of gestation (average 4.7% per week; r = 0.97, p less than 0.0001). When compared with patients delivering spontaneously at term, average maximum uterine activity per 10-minute window was greatest in the preterm labor group (p less than 0.05) and least in the postterm labor group (p less than 0.05). These differences were present for several weeks preceding the onset of spontaneous labor. All three groups showed a surge of uterine activity during the 3 days before the onset of spontaneous labor.\r"

Comprehensive treatment guidelines for posterior fracture-dislocation of the shoulder with fracture of the humeral head have not been previously published. Although open reduction and internal fixation of the proximal humerus for posterior fracture-dislocation has been reported in several series, the successful reconstruction of the articular surface by rigid internal fixation of a large osteochondral fragment has not been reported. This paper describes two cases of posterior fracture-dislocation of the shoulder with a substantial defect of the anteromedial humeral head resulting from the cleavage of a large osteochondral fragment. Preoperative computed axial tomographic (CAT) scanning of the injured shoulders helped in operative planning by precisely defining the extent of the articular injury. Accurate reconstruction of the articular surface restored joint stability and gave excellent clinical results. Large humeral head osteochondral fracture fragments require accurate reduction and internal fixation.\r"

  ".W": "CA 125 was assayed in amniotic fluid and tissue extracts by immunoradiometric assay, and immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin-embedded sections of endometrium, decidua, and fetal membranes with the monoclonal antibody OC 125 used as primary antibody. The concentration of CA 125 in amniotic fluid changes during pregnancy so that levels of 800 to 1000 U/ml are found before 12 weeks. Thereafter, levels of 4000 to 10,000 U/ml are detected routinely. As term approaches, amniotic fluid CA 125 concentrations fall to a range of 1000 to 2000 U/ml. Levels of CA 125 in tissue extracts of secretory endometrium and decidua were 65,000 and 29,500 U/gm of tissue, respectively. CA 125 was readily detected on the apical surfaces of glandular epithelium and in the secretions of endometrial glands obtained throughout the menstrual cycle. It was also detected in the lumina of decidualized glands throughout pregnancy. No antigen was detectable within glandular epithelial cells. We have previously reported high concentrations of CA 125 in chorionic tissue extracts (42,000 U/gm) and low concentrations in amniotic tissue extracts (275 U/gm). In contrast to those findings, immunohistochemical techniques detected CA 125 within the intercellular canaliculi that surround amniotic epithelial cells but not in chorion. We conclude that the likely source of amniotic fluid CA 125 is the decidua and that it gains access to the amniotic fluid via the intercellular canalicular system that traverses the amniotic epithelium.\r"

In another patient, prolonged asystole failed to respond to standard advanced cardiac life-support therapy. High-dose epinephrine was given 38 minutes after arrest, and return of spontaneous circulation subsequently occurred. Intensive treatment efforts were discontinued after admission to the hospital, and the patient died. The temporal sequence in these patients suggests that high-dose epinephrine therapy caused the return of spontaneous circulation. Recent studies suggest that presently recommended epinephrine doses may be too low, and investigation of graded epinephrine doses for the treatment of cardiac arrest is indicated.\r"

Immunization protected against infection--only 3.6% of immunized children developed measles, whereas 30.1% of those not immunized became ill (P less than .001). Thus, the vaccine efficacy rate was 90.1%. The average age at presentation was 72 months, and older patients were more likely to have severe disease. Nutritional status had no effect on susceptibility to measles infection or on outcome; weight loss (350 +/- 170 g) was most marked during the prodromal phase in young children. Infection was more severe when more than one case was diagnosed in a household (P less than .05) and in conditions of overcrowding, which were also associated with higher infection rates (P less than .02). Although immunization did not stop the spread of the epidemic within the village, a strict quarantine in the medical clinic probably prevented spread to other villages.\r"

After 5 days of continuous dosing (at 6 PM), all patients received their regular Uniphyl dose under specified fasting conditions, and serum theophylline concentrations were measured sequentially during the following 24 hours. The patients' next Uniphyl dose was administered immediately after ingestion of a standardized high-fat meal, and theophylline concentrations were again measured during 24 hours. Five days later, the procedure was repeated in the opposite order. The patients' mean daily theophylline dose was 890.0 +/- 229.2 mg. We found relatively minor, but in some cases statistically significant, differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between food and fasting administration. When Uniphyl was administered with food, bioavailability was increased by 10% (p less than 0.01), the time of maximum concentration occurred 3 hours later (p less than 0.01), and the minimum or \"trough\" theophylline concentration was 0.7 mg/L greater (p less than 0.01), as compared to administration while patients were fasting. There was no evidence of \"dose dumping\" after either food or fasting administration of Uniphyl, and there was no significant difference in the maximum theophylline concentration attained between the two dosing conditions. There was no evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the two dosing conditions. All patients tolerated the drug well throughout the trial.\r"

Of 77 patients with a history of dysphagia, significantly more had abnormal manometry during the test meal than with water swallows (79 vs. 43%, p less than 0.005). Additionally, dysphagia, although reported in only 8% of these patients during standard testing, occurred in 47% during the test meal (p less than 0.001). Of 60 patients with chest pain, symptoms were rarely reported (5%) with water or with food ingestion.

In 25 clinically confirmed conception cycles, the earliest pregnancy-induced hCG rises from baseline occurred 8 days after the endocrinologically defined date of ovulation (mean 11.1 days, SD 1.3). Urine samples obtained throughout 50 non-conception ovulatory cycles provided no evidence of any 'biochemical pregnancies' on the basis of late luteal phase rises of hCG occurring 8 or more days after the endocrinologically defined date of ovulation. If, as in previous studies, the date of ovulation had been estimated on the basis of menstrual cycle length and only the relatively non-specific NIH antiserum had been used in RIAs, 7 of the 50 (14%) cycles would have been classified as resulting in biochemical pregnancies on the basis of hCG greater than 50 m-i.u./ml on one occasion or greater than 20 m-i.u./ml on two or more occasions after day 20 of the cycle. These levels of 'hCG' occurred at or soon after ovulation and could be explained by LH cross-reacting in the RIA. The rises of 'hCG' were not confirmed when the urine samples were retested with an antiserum (Wellcome 895) of very high specificity for hCG. These results raise the possibility that the frequency of clinically unsuspected 'biochemical pregnancy' may have been substantially overestimated.\r"

Despite pretreatment with diphenhydramine and betamethasone a subsequent attempt to perform plasmapheresis with infusion of 5% HSA resulted in a more severe reaction which progressed to respiratory distress. Intradermal skin testing with 5% HSA produced a 9 x 11-mm wheal and 17 x 21-mm erythema at 15 minutes. An enzyme-linked immunoassay was positive for IgE antibody to 5% HSA before and after dialysis for removal of Na caprylate.

Antibodies to cardiolipin were found in very high levels (up to 38 standard deviations above the mean of normal controls) and were of both IgG and IgM isotypes. The 2 patients with SLE and Evans' syndrome who did not have evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies were studied at the onset of SLE which occurred with Evans' syndrome. Although cardiolipin is not a constituent of the cell wall of either platelets or erythrocytes, other phospholipids that cross react antigenically with cardiolipin are and can be exposed through cell damage. This could be a mechanism whereby hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia could occur in the same patient with SLE. Whether absorption of the antiphospholipid antibody during the acute episode of hemocytopenia could occur, and thus prevent its detection at such time, remains undetermined.\r"

Senescent forgetfulness, defined as consistent but not incapacitating memory deficit, may have represented early DAT in some instances. When such cases were included as secondary cases, the morbid risk to first-degree relatives of probands was 67% by age 86 years while risk to comparable control relatives remained 23%. No cases of Down's syndrome were observed. A significant excess of hematologic malignant neoplasms was found among first-degree relatives of probands, supporting an association with DAT. Overall, the findings add further evidence of the action of familial-genetic factors in the etiology of DAT. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with penetrance nearly complete by age 85 years. The probands were not selected on the basis of factors posited by some to indicate a familial form of DAT, suggesting that such a genetic mechanism may be involved in the occurrence of DAT in general.\r"

  ".W": "Sulfur is a time-honored therapeutic agent useful in a variety of dermatologic disorders. Its keratolytic action is due to formation of hydrogen sulfide through a reaction that depends upon direct interaction between sulfur particles and keratinocytes. The smaller the particle size, the greater the degree of such interaction and the greater the therapeutic efficacy. When applied topically, sulfur induces various histologic changes, including hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and dilatation of dermal vasculature. One study showed that sulfur was comedogenic when applied onto human and rabbit skin, findings that were not reproduced in other studies. About 1% of topically applied sulfur is systemically absorbed. Adverse effects from topically applied sulfur are uncommon and are mainly limited to the skin. In infants, however, fatal outcome after extensive application has been reported.\r"

  ".W": "In closing, we can only note that none of the classification schemes for myocarditis has been perfect for clinicians, pathologists, and researchers alike. The definition and classification protocol offered by the \"Dallas\" group is based solely on histology, but we urge its use by physicians and other researchers as a means of imposing some standardization on the study of myocarditis. The question of optimum treatment, particularly immunosuppressive therapy, has never been definitively answered, but it is now clear that a large, multicenter randomized trial is the only proper method to search for such an answer. Standard nomenclature is a prerequisite for this study. In the meantime, the clinical correlates and prognostic utility of these histologic categories may be defined; these morphologic groupings will probably be shown to be clinically heterogeneous. In the end, we hope a hybrid clinical-pathologic scheme for the diagnosis and classification of myocarditis will be forged. Such a protocol, ideally, will allow the correlation of structure with function and also reliably predict clinical behavior and response to treatment so that someday we may be able to both counsel and cure persons with myocarditis.\r"

The part played by the pathologist in the care of these patients is crucial. It is vital to make the diagnosis of acute rejection before it becomes irreversible and also before it causes chronic damage to the coronary arteries. It is also vital that the pathologist does not either miss the diagnosis of an infectious myocarditis in the immunosuppressed patient or misdiagnose myocarditis as rejection, because the treatments for each one of these conditions are diametrically opposed. The role of the pathologist has become one of an important clinical colleague in the management and survival of patients with cardiac allografts.\r"

They were killed ten wk later by several schedules of formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and formaldehyde-ethanol-acetic acid perfusion-fixation. Layer Vb of the sensorimotor cortex, the site of origin of corticospinal axons severed by the operation, was searched by light and electron microscopic methods for evidence of neuronal necrosis. Cord-transected rats were compared with control, unoperated animals of identical age. Nerve cell death was not evident to qualitative study, although shrunken, deeply-staining neurons of artefactitious origin occurred capriciously in paraffin sections when fixation was initiated with a dilute formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde solution. Quantitative light and electron microscopic studies were also negative for indications of neuronal death. However, mild somal atrophy could be substantiated for layer Vb neurons of cord-transected rats by light microscopic, morphometric methods. Neuronal atrophy was unaccompanied by qualitative or quantitative ultrastructural alterations. Subcellular organelles and the per cent of neuronal plasma membrane apposed by axosomatic boutons were unchanged. Neuroglia and neuronal processes always had a normal electron microscopic appearance.\r"

The studies were obtained to evaluate right upper quadrant pain (two patients), tenderness (three patients), and abnormal liver function tests (eight patients). The two major sonographic findings were gallbladder wall thickening (eight patients), which often was marked, and bile duct dilatation (two patients). Gallbladder wall thickness varied from 4 to 15 mm and was greater than 1 cm in four patients. Follow-up sonograms in five patients showed increasing wall thickness in four and decreasing thickness in one, but these findings did not correlate well with the clinical status of the patient. Pericholecystic fluid was shown in three cases. None of the patients had gallstones. Common bile duct dilatation varied from 12 to 15 mm; no specific cause for dilatation was found by cholangiography. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare was recovered from the gallbladder in one patient, and Cryptosporidium was recovered from the duodenum in two patients. AIDS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening or bile duct dilatation in the appropriate clinical setting. These findings may indicate opportunistic infection of the biliary tract. A disparity may exist between the mild symptoms and signs (or lack of symptoms and signs) related to the gallbladder and bile ducts and the sometimes marked sonographic abnormalities.\r"

To evaluate transvaginal depiction of the endometrium, transvaginal sonograms were compared with conventional transabdominal scans in 29 patients whose sonograms revealed endometrial abnormalities. The two techniques were compared for image quality and ability to provide unique diagnostic information. Sonographic findings included fluid collections (16), thickened and/or echogenic endometria (10), endometrial irregularities (two), and echogenic foci (two). Clinical diagnoses included early intrauterine pregnancies (five), pseudogestational sacs of ectopic pregnancy (one), intrauterine contraceptive devices (two), endometrial carcinoma (one), and intrauterine synechiae with amenorrhea (Asherman syndrome) (two). In most cases (77%), diagnostic information was obtainable by either transabdominal or transvaginal sonograms, although in 23% transvaginal scanning provided unique diagnostic information not available with the transabdominal technique. In no case did transabdominal sonography contribute diagnostic information not provided transvaginally. The quality of the transvaginal image was judged to be better than that of the transabdominal image in 63% of cases; image quality was the same in 33% of cases and worse in 3% of cases. The results show that transvaginal sonography is often superior to transabdominal scanning in the evaluation of endometrial abnormalities. Transvaginal sonography may be the preferred technique in these cases.\r"

However, classic hypothesis testing has its limitations, and probabilities mathematically calculated are inextricably linked to sample size. Furthermore, the meaning of the p value frequently is misconstrued as indicating that the findings are also of clinical significance. Finally, hypothesis testing allows for four possible outcomes, two of which are errors that can lead to erroneous adoption of certain hypotheses: 1. The null hypothesis is rejected when, in fact, it is false. 2. The null hypothesis is rejected when, in fact, it is true (type I or alpha error). 3. The null hypothesis is conceded when, in fact, it is true. 4. The null hypothesis is conceded when, in fact, it is false (type II or beta error). The implications of these errors, their relation to sample size, the interpretation of negative trials, and strategies related to the planning of clinical trials will be explored in a future article in this journal.\r"

  ".U": "88078351\r", 
  ".W": "Erythroid differentiation is mediated by several interacting factors which include the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo), interleukin-3 (IL-3) in the mouse, and erythroid-potentiating activity (EPA) in humans. Each of these factors binds to specific cell surface receptors on responsive target cells, but the way in which these factors interact to modulate erythropoiesis is unknown. In the present study, we used the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 to examine expression and regulation of the receptor for Epo using 125I-labeled, bioactive recombinant human Epo. K562 cells expressed low numbers of a single class of high-affinity Epo receptors corresponding to 4 to 6 receptors per K562 cell (KD = 270 to 290 pmol/L). Treatment of K562 cell cultures with medium conditioned by the EPA-secreting cell line U937 (U937CM) increased receptor expression 2.6 to 3.5-fold to 13 to 17 receptors/cell (KD = 260 to 300 pmol/L). That all of the Epo receptor-potentiating activity in U937CM was accounted for by EPA was shown by a similar increase in Epo receptor expression on K562 cells with recombinant EPA. The effect of U937CM on Epo receptors was reversed by culturing cells in inducer-free medium for 3 days. Medium conditioned by the 5637 cell line had no effect on Epo receptors on K562 cells. In methylcellulose culture, U937CM and Epo acted synergistically to increase erythroid differentiation of K562. Similarly, U937CM stimulated human cord blood CFU-E growth under conditions in which Epo was limiting or in excess. Increases in Epo receptor expression on K562 cells and on CFU-E in response to EPA may mediate the effects of Epo on these cells.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro coculture studies were performed in five patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and their normal HLA-matched donors before and after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to determine whether the erythropoietic function of T cells is abnormal in this disorder. These coculture studies used fresh or cryopreserved marrow T lymphocytes with fresh or cryopreserved marrow T cell-depleted target cells. Four of five aplastic patients had little or no transfusion exposure before studies. The composite results showed that, in comparison to the erythropoietic effects of normal HLA-identical marrow T lymphocytes or engrafted T lymphocytes, T lymphocytes collected from the aplastic patients before BMT consistently suppressed or failed to support CFUE and BFUE growth optimally from autologous marrow, HLA-identical marrow, or engrafted aplastic T cell-depleted marrows. This T cell abnormality was not observed in four multiply transfused leukemics and three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Marker analyses of SAA marrow T lymphocytes performed before and after BMT suggested that the erythropoietic functional abnormality was due to abnormal marrow T cell composition reflecting an excess of activated Tac+, T3+, T11+ lymphocytes. Collectively, these in vitro studies provide firmer in vitro evidence implicating T cells in the pathogenesis of SAA. The erythropoietic T cells abnormalities in SAA are fully corrected by allogeneic BMT.\r"

A factor present in Mo conditioned medium (Mo-CM) acts synergistically with sodium butyrate to promote basophilic maturation in a dose-dependent fashion. The induced HL-60 cells exhibit nuclei at various stages of maturity and cytoplasmic granules staining azurophilic with May-Grunwald-Giemsa and metachromatically with toluidine blue. The histamine content of induced HL-60 cells is 50 ng/10(6) cells with sodium butyrate alone or 190 ng/10(6) cells with butyrate in combination with Mo-CM. Induced cells release histamine in response to anti-IgE and have receptors for the Fc portion of human IgE. The basophilic cell-differentiating activity present in Mo-CM appears to be distinct from several other cytokines including recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, interferon-alpha, murine interleukin-3, erythroid-potentiating activity, and purified human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This is the first demonstration of a cell line that is capable of differentiation along the basophil lineage and could provide a useful model for examining biochemical and molecular events associated with basophil differentiation.\r"

On stimulation with endotoxin or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), TF of these cells is known to be increased approximately fourfold. In this report, we demonstrate that VIIa/TF inhibitor is also increased on stimulation of U937 cells with endotoxin (approximately equal to threefold) or with PMA (approximately equal to 20-fold). Notably, the secretion of the inhibitor persisted after the cell surface TF had started to decline. Further, when serum-free media from PMA stimulated cells was electrophoresed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel, we eluted two inhibitor activity peaks corresponding to Mr approximately equal to 47,000 and Mr approximately equal to 36,000. The molecular weights of these peaks are similar to those obtained earlier from human plasma for this inhibitor(s).\r"

The possibility of c-myc alterations in human myeloma has not been explored, probably because the low proliferative activity characteristic of this tumor impairs the propagation of representative cell lines for the performance of adequate cytogenetic studies. This report describes alterations in the c-myc locus with concomitant elevated expression of mRNA in the tumor cells of two of 37 patients with multiple myeloma. In one case, somatic cell hybrid studies revealed that the cloned rearranged DNA was entirely derived from chromosome 8, thus indicating a novel mechanism of c-myc activation different from that in Burkitt's lymphoma. Seven other patients exhibited five- to 12-fold overexpression of c-myc RNA when compared with normal marrow cells. Elevated mRNA expression in about one fourth of our patients suggests that the c-myc oncogene has a pathogenetic role in the evolution of multiple myeloma.\r"

The nature of surface ligands on host endothelial cells that may mediate cytoadherence is poorly understood. We have investigated the effects of soluble thrombospondin, rabbit antiserum raised against thrombospondin, and human immune serum on cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes in ex vivo mesocecum vasculature. Preincubation of infected red cells with soluble thrombospondin or human immune serum inhibits binding of infected red cells to rat venular endothelium. Infusion of the microcirculatory preparation with rabbit antithrombospondin antibodies before perfusion of parasitized erythrocytes also resulted in decreased cytoadherence. In addition, incubation of infected cells with human immune sera obtained from malaria patients significantly inhibited the observed cytoadherence. Our results indicate that thrombospondin mediates binding of infected red cells to venular endothelium and may thus be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.\r"

For precision studies aqueous quality control materials were used. A total of 85 blood samples were tested. The precision of the glucose meters (expressed as the coefficient of variation [CV]) in the hands of the experienced operator ranged from 6.7% to 11.1%. The correlation between the values obtained by the experienced operator and the reference values obtained in the laboratory was high (0.95 to 0.98). The precision of the values obtained by the nurses using the meters ranged from 13.7% on medical wards to 45.7% in the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between these values and those obtained in the central laboratory ranged from 0.72 to 0.82. Twenty-four percent of the glucose values determined on medical wards and 62% of those determined in the ICU deviated from the reference value by at least 20%. Of the 85 patients 12 (14%) would have received different insulin dosages had the reference value been available at the same time as the glucose meter reading: in 3 of the patients the discrepancy was 6 units of insulin or greater. Continuous quality control of bedside monitoring of the blood glucose level is needed. In addition, personnel who use glucose meters should receive adequate training.\r"

  ".W": "It is estimated that more than 110 million dollars' worth of oral antibiotics will have been sold in Canada in 1987. In the next few years several new oral antimicrobial agents will reach the market, including beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, monobactams, erythromycins and quinolones. Most of these new agents have a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than the presently available oral antibiotics. A few have a longer half-life and can be administered once a day. The new oral drugs, especially the quinolones and possibly beta-lactams, will now be used to treat infections that in the past could be treated only parenterally. Exacerbations of pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis can now be successfully treated at home with the new quinolones. Osteomyelitis, arthritis, pneumonia and pyelonephritis will most likely be treated at home in the future. In severe infections patients will be admitted to hospital for short courses of parenteral therapy, followed by oral treatment. If used appropriately the new oral agents may lead to new approaches to the treatment of infectious diseases.\r"

Evidence of an association between the potential exposure to agricultural chemicals and three major anomalies combined as well as spina bifida without hydrocephalus was found. More plausible was an association between stillbirths and such exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy. This finding, along with the cyclic patterns of stillbirth in the agricultural Saint John River basin and the somewhat higher stillbirth rates in New Brunswick than in adjacent provinces or in Canada as a whole, suggests that further attention should focus on possible associations between agricultural activity and stillbirths.\r"

In addition, three other cases of AFF-producing renal cancer recently published in the literature in Japan are reviewed. These four cases indicate that mesoderm-originating malignant tumors such as renal cell carcinomas can produce AFP in some situations. So, AFP is probably more universal than believed, although it is generally a popular and useful tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinomas and yolk sac tumors. The knowledge of the presence of AFP-producing renal cell carcinomas will make a new contribution to the study of the oncogenesis of AFP-producing tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The results of treatment of 686, previously untreated patients younger than 21 years with rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma, who were entered on Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study-I (IRS-I) were analyzed after a minimum potential follow-up time of 7 years. Patients in Clinical Group I (localized disease, completely resected) were randomized to receive either vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or VAC + radiation. At 5 years, approximately 80% of patients given either treatment were still disease-free and there was no significant difference between treatments in the overall percentages of patients surviving of 93% and 81%, respectively (P = 0.67). Patients in Clinical Group II (regional disease, grossly resected) were randomized to receive either vincristine and dactinomycin (VA) + radiation or VAC + radiation. At 5 years, 72% and 65% of the patients, respectively, were disease-free and there was no evidence of a difference between treatments (P = 0.46). The overall survival percentage at 5 years was approximately 72% for both treatments. Patients in Clinical Groups III (gross residual disease after surgery) and IV (metastatic disease) were randomized to receive either \"pulse\" VAC + radiation or \"pulse\" VAC + Adriamycin (doxorubicin) + radiation. The complete remission (CR) rate was 69% in Clinical Group III and 50% in IV, with no statistically significant difference in CR rates between treatments in either group. Those who achieved a CR had a nearly 60% chance of staying in remission for 5 years in Clinical Group III compared with approximately 30% in Clinical Group IV. The overall survival percentage at 5 years was 52% in Clinical Group III compared to 20% in Clinical Group IV (P less than 0.0001). The 5-year survival percentage for the entire cohort of 686 patients was 55%. Survival after relapse was poor, being 32% at 1 year and 17% at 2 years. The risk of distant metastasis was much greater than the risk of local recurrence within each clinical group, and there was no evidence of differing types of relapses between treatments. Primary tumors of the orbit and genitourinary tract carried the best prognosis, whereas tumors of the retroperitoneum had the worst prognosis. The authors conclude that for the therapeutic regimens evaluated there was no therapeutic advantage to including radiation in the treatment of Clinical Group I disease, or cyclophosphamide given as a daily low-dose oral regimen in the treatment of Clinical Group II disease or Adriamycin in the treatment of Clinical Groups III and IV diseases.\r"

CEA levels in malignant effusions were significantly higher than those in benign effusions. At a cutoff level of 5 ng/ml, 68% of the patients with lung cancer and 44% of the patients with other malignancies showed elevated pleural fluid CEA levels. In 13 lung cancer cases with negative pleural fluid cytology, nine cases had elevated pleural fluid CEA levels. The mean pleural fluid BMG level of patients with benign diseases was significantly higher than that of patients with malignant diseases, but there was a marked overlap between those with malignant and benign diseases. No significant differences were found in the pleural fluid ferritin, ASP, TPA, and IAP levels between malignant and benign conditions. ASP and IAP pleural fluid levels showed significant correlations with the pleural fluid C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations suggesting that they also reflect inflammatory activity. The mean ADA activity in tuberculous effusion was significantly higher than that resulting from other causes of pleural effusion.\r"

Fever and night sweats were evident in two, and two patients had lost weight. One patient was asymptomatic; the liver mass was detected during the work-up for cancer of the prostate. Seven patients on whom computerized tomography was performed all had solitary masses in the liver although in three of them tumor had extended into both lobes as noticed at surgery. One had additional porta hepatic lymph node metastasis. Eight patients underwent an exploratory laparotomy; four had hepatic resection, and four had wedge biopsies of unresectable liver tumor. One patient had a percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver. Eight patients received combination chemotherapy. Six patients are alive, five of whom are in initial complete remission. All three patients who died had persistent or recurrent disease in the liver. The results of therapy and surgery to date in these and in other cases in the literature are encouraging.\r"

Urinary 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 and plasma 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, major enzymatic metabolites of thromboxane A2, were markedly increased after intravenous streptokinase (11,063 +/- 2758 pg/mg creatinine and 33 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively) compared with levels in patients not receiving thrombolytic therapy (502 +/- 89 pg/mg creatinine and 3 +/- 0.7 pg/ml). Prostacyclin biosynthesis also increased markedly after streptokinase coincident with the increase in thromboxane A2 formation. Administration of aspirin between the time of onset of coronary thrombosis and reperfusion both in man and in a canine preparation demonstrated that this reflected thromboxane biosynthesis de novo and not metabolism of preformed inactive thromboxane B2 washed out from the coronary circulation. Since the platelet is the major source of thromboxane A2, these findings suggest that there is marked platelet activation after coronary thrombolysis with streptokinase. Studies in vitro demonstrated that streptokinase enhanced platelet activation in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in the secondary release of thromboxane A2. The increase in platelet activation and thromboxane A2 biosynthesis may limit the therapeutic effect of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "We have tested the feasibility and effectiveness of a 2 year (average 16 +/- 7 months) walk/jog exercise program on 36 male orthotopic cardiac transplant patients (21 to 57 years old) seen initially 2 to 23 months after surgery. Comparison of initial exercise test results with those in 45 age-matched normal men showed the patients to have a lesser lean body mass (56 +/- 7 vs 63 +/- 8 kg, p less than .001), with a higher resting heart rate (104 +/- 12 vs 77 +/- 14 beats/min, p less than .001) and systolic (138 +/- 16 vs 129 +/- 17 mm Hg, p less than .001) and diastolic (95 +/- 14 vs 84 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than .001) blood pressures. Peak power output was less than normal (101 +/- 27 vs 219 +/- 41 W, p less than .001), as was peak heart rate (136 +/- 15 vs 176 +/- 13 beats/min, p less than .001), peak oxygen intake (VO2max) (22 +/- 5 vs 34 +/- 6 ml.kg.min-1, p less than .001), and absolute anaerobic threshold (1.18 +/- 0.40 vs 2.04 +/- 0.40 liters.min-1, p less than .001). Peak ventilatory equivalent was higher (48 +/- 9 vs 37 +/- 61.1-1, p less than .001). Cardiac output (Q), as estimated by the CO2 rebreathing method, was slightly above normal at rest (p less than .01), but below normal at two submaximal work rates. The group's average weekly training distance was 24 km, with eight highly compliant patients progressing to 32 km or more weekly. After training, lean tissue increased (+2.4 +/- 3.1 kg, p less than .001), and resting values were reduced for heart rate (-4 +/- 11 beats/min, p less than .05), systolic (-13 +/- 20 mm Hg, p less than .001), and diastolic (-9 +/- 17 mm Hg, p less than .001) blood pressures. There were significant reductions in submaximal values for minute ventilation (VE), ratings of perceived exertion, and diastolic blood pressure at equivalent workloads. Peak values increased for power output (+49 +/- 34 W, p less than .001), VO2max (+4.0 +/- 6.0 ml.kg.min-1, p less than .001), VE (+20 +/- 20 l.min-1, p less than .001), and heart rate (+13 +/- 17 beats/min, p less than .001), and decreased for diastolic blood pressure (-8 +/- 15 mm Hg, p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an experimental ischemic compartment syndrome in dogs, phosphorus (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the tissue pressure threshold at which resting skeletal muscle begins to use anaerobic energy sources due to insufficient cellular oxygen delivery. The interactive effects of systemic perfusion pressure and moderate muscle trauma on this anaerobic threshold were also evaluated. The severity of cell injury produced by various degrees of compartment pressurization over an eight-hour period was concomitantly studied using muscle biopsy and electron microscopy. Clinical correlation of a preliminary patient series studied using 31P-NMR demonstrated that the threshold for cellular metabolic derangement in skeletal muscle subjected to increased tissue pressure was more closely associated with the difference between mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and compartment pressure than with the absolute compartment pressure alone. The difference is termed MABP-compartment pressure, or delta P. The lowest delta P at which a normal cellular metabolic state can be maintained is approximately 30 mmHg in normal muscle and 40 mmHg in moderately traumatized muscle. It is imperative to interpret compartment pressure measurements in light of the degree of soft tissue trauma sustained and the patient's blood pressure, as well as the clinical signs and symptoms.\r"

Upon catabolism of osteocalcin, its characteristic amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla), is excreted into the urine. Both serum osteocalcin and urine Gla are currently being used for the clinical assessment of bone disease. The authors summarize the current understanding of the structure and function of osteocalcin in bone and evaluate the clinical studies done using serum osteocalcin and urinary Gla to monitor bone turnover. Factors that affect the measurement of osteocalcin concentrations in the blood are osteoblastic synthesis, content of Gla in the protein, drug-induced alterations in osteocalcin's affinity for bone, hormonal status, renal function, age, sex, timing of blood collection, and specificity of the radioimmunoassay. With these considerations, serum osteocalcin measurements provide a noninvasive specific marker of bone metabolism.\r"

Posterior cruciate ligament-preserving prostheses often can be used, but prostheses with extra degrees of constraint must be available. Long-stemmed components for both the femoral and tibial sides should be available. Access to a bone bank to obtain allogeneic bone for grafting is essential. The surgeon must be familiar with techniques other than bone grafting for restoration of deficient stock, such as the use of bone screws and cement, custom-augmented components, and metal wedge spacers.\r"

  ".W": "In a comparative study of 93 small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants against 93 weight-matched, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonates, the SGA group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of periventricular-intraventricular type intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at the first ultrasound scan than did the AGA neonates (9/93 vs 21/93; p less than 0.02). This apparent advantage was no longer maintained in later scans of the first week (16/93 vs 27/93; NS), despite the fact that the SGA group were 4 weeks advanced in gestational age and had fewer respiratory problems than the AGA controls. It is prudent, therefore, to follow SGA infants closely for ICH by repeat ultrasound examinations even if the first scan is negative. Evaluation of the subgroup of SGA infants with ICH against the total SGA population revealed lower admission body temperature and Apgar scores, and higher incidence of asphyxia, resuscitation, and mortality. The above observations in SGA infants with ICH and the lack of a similar trend between the AGA infants with ICH and the total AGA population suggest that SGA status, hypothermia, and ICH are interrelated. Hypothermia, therefore, can be used as a convenient marker for the possibility of ICH in low birth weight SGA infants. The authors' data is consistent with the view that hypothermia and ICH are both the consequences of perinatal asphyxia in SGA infants and probably reflect the magnitude of stormy perinatal events.\r"

Although not rare, it is infrequently recognized. C-OMA is not a specific disease entity, but a sign. It may be associated with other static congenital CNS disorders and must be distinguished from acquired ocular motor apraxias (A-OMA) seen in progressive brain disorders and in certain serious systemic diseases. Therefore, when movements typical of C-OMA are observed, a careful systemic and neurologic examination should be performed, including immunoglobulin screening, cranial computerized tomography scanning, and adequate follow-up.

The RIA/HPLC concentration ratio of cyclosporine changed continuously during the first 12 hours after administration. The ratio was higher after oral than after intravenous administration and varied from patient to patient. The predictive value of trough levels for the corresponding AUCs was better when trough levels were assessed 24 than 12 hours after administration. Trough levels assessed by RIA poorly predicted AUCs measured specifically by HPLC. Therefore if, in the future, therapeutic cyclosporine monitoring has to be improved, trough levels should be assessed 24 hours after the last dose by means of a specific HPLC method.\r"

The patients were administered either 2 mg buprenorphine or 30 mg methadone for 3 weeks followed by 4 weeks of dose reductions and 6 weeks of placebo medication. No significant between-group differences were seen on measures of treatment retention, drug use, or symptom report. During the hydromorphone challenge, methadone attenuated opioid effects to a greater extent than did buprenorphine on both physiologic (pupil constriction) and self-report measures. However, this did not result in greater abuse of illicit opioid drugs by subjects taking buprenorphine. The results of this clinical trial indicated that buprenorphine was acceptable to patients and as effective as methadone in the detoxification treatment of heroin addicts.\r"

Seventeen patients (18 episodes of asthma) formed the study population. Eight episodes occurred in patients who received depot methylprednisolone (group 1) and ten episodes in patients who received oral corticosteroid treatment (group 2). All patients in both groups improved following emergency room treatment. Relapse occurred in two of ten patients in group 2 and none in group 1. Symptoms attributable to asthma recurred in significantly more patients in group 2 than in group 1 (9 vs 0, p less than .01). Side effects from therapy with corticosteroids were rare. This study indicates that intramuscular repository corticosteroids are at least as effective as oral corticosteroids in the management of the acute asthmatic outpatient, with a distinct advantage with regard to patient compliance.\r"

Quantitative sputum culture or blood culture (or both) permitted bacteriologic diagnosis in 44 percent of the cases. The radiologic types found were segmental or alveolar densities in 75 patients (65 percent), patchy alveolar densities in 11 (9 percent), mixed opacities in 26 (22 percent), and interstitial infiltrates in four (3 percent). We observed that (a) the prognosis was identical whether a bacteriologic diagnosis was made or not, (b) the Gram stain, an inexpensive procedure, was as contributive for bacteriologic diagnosis as quantitative sputum culture, diagnosis as (c) blood cultures were poorly contributive in patients without severe infections, and (d) alveolar densities were associated with a bacterial infection in 90 percent of the cases of known etiology. On the basis of these results, a pragmatic strategy of initial management of community-acquired pneumonia is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "An estrogen-inducible 97-kilodalton (kDa) secretory glycoprotein, designated as uterine secretory protein (USP)-1, synthesized by rat uterine epithelial cells was identified and characterized. Uterine luminal fluid (ULF) proteins were labeled by direct administration of [35S]methionine into uterine lumen of rats. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into ULF proteins was negligible in ovariectomized rats. However, when 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was administered in the ovariectomized rat as sc paraffin pellets, a marked increase of [35S]methionine incorporation was noted after 2 days of treatment, showing that the de novo synthesis and secretion of ULF proteins were induced by E2. Six estrogen-inducible polypeptides (130, 110, 97, 65, 42, and 39 kDa) were identified in the analysis of the labeled ULF proteins by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Four of these polypeptides (110, 65, 42, and 39 kDa) were adsorbed by the immobilized antibody against rat serum proteins, indicating that these polypeptides are antigenically similar to serum proteins. Two polypeptides (130 and 97 kDa) not adsorbed by the antibody column were suggested to be uterine-specific secretory proteins. The 97-kDa protein (USP-1) was further purified by preparative sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution. Reactivity of purified USP-1 to various lectins and carbohydrate composition analysis suggested that USP-1 possesses biantennary N-linked complex-type carbohydrate chain with fucose. Rabbit polyclonal antibody which can specifically immunoprecipitate [35S]methionine-labeled USP-1 was developed. Dot blot enzyme immunoassay showed that 4-day E2-treated ULF contains 78.3 +/- 24.1 (+/- SE) micrograms USP-1/mg protein. Immunohistochemical staining of rat uterine tissue showed that this protein localized only in the epithelial cells treated with estrogen (E2 and diethylstilbestrol). Testosterone, progesterone, and dexamethasone failed to induce synthesis and secretion of USP-1 as assessed by dot blot enzyme immunoassay, immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled ULF proteins, and immunohistochemical staining of uterine tissue. The present result, for the first time, revealed that estrogen can induce synthesis and secretion of specific secretory protein which could be the useful marker to analyze the molecular mechanism of estrogen action in rat uterine epithelial cells.\r"

Scatchard analysis of crude membrane binding was linear, whereas Scatchard analysis after wheat germ agglutinin purification of the receptor became curvilinear. The IGF-I receptor alpha-subunits of SK-N-SH have an apparent Mr of 126K, whereas that for SK-N-MC is 132K. Despite these differences in alpha-subunit structure both cell lines demonstrate IGF-I-induced autophosphorylation of their own beta-subunits as well as specific IGF-I induced tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting normal coupling between the ligand-binding alpha-subunit and the tyrosine kinase-containing beta-subunit. Furthermore, IGF-I stimulated iododeoxyuridine uptake in both SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that these cells may be used to study the role of IGF-I action on neural tissues.\r"

  ".U": "88082438\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on meiotic maturation was analyzed in oocytes from immature rats treated with PMSG. TGF beta accelerated the maturation of both follicle-enclosed oocytes and cumulus-oocyte complexes, as measured by an increase in the percentage of oocytes with germinal vesicle breakdown. Concentrations of the growth factor as low as 1 pM (25 pg/ml) increased oocyte maturation by 50% above control values, and 100 pM TGF beta caused a maximal 2-fold rise in the maturation rate. Germinal vesicle breakdown was significantly increased by TGF beta during the first 4 h of incubation, and stimulatory effects were observed as early as 1 h. However, by 8 h over 90% of the oocytes showed maturation in the absence or presence of TGF beta, indicating that the growth factor enhanced the spontaneous rate of oocyte development. TGF beta had no effect in denuded oocytes, demonstrating that the growth factor altered maturation through an action on the surrounding cumulus cells. Oocyte maturation was not accelerated by TGF beta in the presence of inhibitors of germinal vesicle breakdown, such as cAMP and hypoxanthine. Other growth factors, including IGF-I (50 ng/ml) and IGF-II (50 ng/ml), also stimulated oocyte maturation, while platelet-derived growth factor (100 ng/ml) and insulin (1 microgram/ml) had minimal effects on germinal vesicle breakdown. Although epidermal growth factor (EGF; 100 ng/ml) also increased the maturation of oocytes, lower concentrations of TGF beta (1-10 pM) suppressed EGF action by up to 30%. TGF beta, EGF, and insulin-like growth factors had minimal effects on cAMP production by cumulus-oocyte complexes. These results demonstrate that TGF beta and other growth factors are potent in vitro stimulators of oocyte maturation in the rat. Such effects of growth factors in vivo, in the presence of endogenous follicular factors and gonadotropic hormones, may regulate the selection and meiotic maturation of oocytes during follicular development. The rapidity of growth factor action in the oocyte provides a defined model to study signal transduction pathways of growth factors in relationship to their biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on DNA replication and release of insulin and somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (SM-C/IGF-I) from cultured fetal rat islets have been studied. In medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and 16.7 mM glucose, both PDGF (2-10 ng/ml) and SM-C/IGF-I (100 ng/ml) stimulated DNA replication 2-fold. The growth stimulatory effects of the two peptides were additive. In the absence of serum, SM-C/IGF-I, but not PDGF, stimulated DNA replication. Under conditions of PDGF-stimulated DNA replication there was no increased release of either insulin or SM-C/IGF-I into the culture medium. An antibody against SM-C/IGF-I which inhibited SM-C/IGF-I-stimulated DNA replication did not affect PDGF-stimulated DNA replication. Similarly, an antibody against PDGF did not affect DNA replication stimulated by SM-C/IGF-I. It is concluded that PDGF stimulates islet cell DNA replication. This is the first demonstration of a tissue of nonmesodermal origin responding to PDGF. Stimulation of DNA replication appears to be independent of SM-C/IGF-I release, and furthermore, the results indicate that the islets do not produce PDGF-like substances themselves. It is suggested that PDGF is of importance for fetal islet development.\r"

Hybridomas were initially screened for antibodies to cell surface antigens by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay using rat anterior pituitary cells and smooth muscle cells of aorta as positive and negative controls, respectively. Positive clones were further checked for cell type specificity by immunofluorescence. Mab WHC-1 is an immunoglobulin M (IgM) with kappa-light chains and is cytotoxic in the presence of complement. Based on double immunofluorescence, this Mab reacted with 22.5 +/- 2.0% (+/- SEM) of the anterior pituitary cells of adult random cycling female rats. Among them, about 93.5 +/- 1.4% were somatotrophs, and only 4.1 +/- 1.2% were mammotrophs. Approximately two thirds of the somatotrophs were Mab WHC-1-positive. The reaction of this Mab with gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, or corticotrophs were negligible. The percentage of Mab WHC-1-positive cells derived from immunoperoxidase staining was significantly greater than that from immunofluorescence. The cell surface antigen defined by Mab WHC-1 is expressed heavily on GH3 cells, but not on smooth muscle cells. It is resistant to trypsin digestion, but sensitive to ethanol treatment, and exhibits the solubility property of a glycolipid. Mab WHC-1 cross-reacts with the anterior pituitary cell of rabbits, but not mice. These results provide the immunological evidence for heterogeneity among somatotrophs and demonstrate the feasibility of making pituitary cell type-specific Mabs.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that the cloned cell line (B-1-A-2) derived from an estrogen-responsive mouse Leydig cell tumor shows an estrogen-dependent enhancement of cell proliferation in medium supplemented with charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. To avoid the involvement of unknown factors present in the serum in the pathway for estrogen-dependent cell growth, the present study was designed to establish a serum-free culture system to which growth factors could be added. To this end, we subcloned B-1 cells from the parental tumor cell line. The proliferation of B-1 cells was markedly stimulated by the addition of 10(-11)-10(-8) M estradiol into the serum-free medium [Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium-Ham's F-12 (1:1, vol/vol) containing 0.2% (wt/vol) BSA]. Epidermal growth factor (0.1-50 ng/ml) or insulin (0.1-50 micrograms/ml) alone or in combination with 10(-8) M estradiol did not affect the proliferation rate of B-1 cells. In contrast, a greater than 10-fold molar excess of 4-hydroxytamoxifen blocked estradiol-induced cell proliferation, while 4-hydroxytamoxifen alone failed to show a stimulatory effect on cell multiplication. Additionally, the conditioned medium collected from estradiol-stimulated cells was found to contain a growth-promoting factor(s) whose activity was not antagonized by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Nonstimulated cells secreted a significant but low level of the growth-promoting factor. Finally, B-1 cells were found to be estrogen dependent for cell proliferation in BALB/c mice. Their growth was markedly inhibited by the administration of tamoxifen to the host mice. These results indicate that the serum-free culture system presented here is suitable for studying the autocrine mechanisms of cell growth regulated by estrogens as well as triphenylethylene compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Cells from the fetal uterus of the guinea pig have been grown as monolayer cell cultures both as primary cultures and through several passages. The cells have a fibroblast-like morphology and ultrastructure, and the subcultures are estrogen responsive. Estradiol induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in specific binding of [3H]R5020 by 9 days in culture, with no effect on proliferation. This binding has the characteristics of the progesterone receptor from the fetal guinea pig uterus (saturable, high affinity, specific for progestins). The increase in progesterone receptor depended on the dose of estradiol, with a half-maximal response at about 5 X 10(-11) M. Progesterone receptor concentrations were inhibited to below basal levels by progesterone and R5020 and the nonsteroidal antiestrogens, tamoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Both progestins and antiestrogens antagonized the stimulatory effect of estradiol. None of these compounds had any effect on cell growth. On the other hand, insulin and epidermal growth factor caused a great increase in cell proliferation. Insulin alone had no effect on progesterone receptor concentrations, but epidermal growth factor stimulated the progesterone receptor about as much as estradiol. Furthermore, coincubation of insulin with estradiol produced a synergistic effect. Estrogen receptor levels were low or undetectable at any time in either the primary culture or the subcultures. It is concluded that fetal uterine cells in culture can serve as a good in vitro model for study of the control of the progesterone receptor in a fetal target tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Specific in vivo neutralization was used in an attempt to explore the roles of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), ACTH, and beta-endorphin during surgical stress in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomly assigned to groups (n = 20-30/group) that received iv injections of rabbit antirat/human CRH (anti-r/hCRH), antihuman ACTH (anti-hACTH), antihuman beta-endorphin (anti-h beta-endorphin), or normal rabbit serum. Three hours later all animals were subjected to a uniform stress consisting of ether anesthesia, surgical laparotomy, and phlebotomy of 7 ml via the inferior vena cava. Survival rates were recorded, and RIAs were performed for ACTH, beta-endorphin, and corticosterone. Rats treated with anti-h beta-endorphin had a survival rate of 64%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (33%; P less than 0.025, by analysis of variance). Anti-r/hCRH or anti-hACTH treatment was not associated with a change in survival rate. Plasma immunoreactive beta-endorphin levels were markedly decreased in the group treated with anti-h beta-endorphin (P less than 0.0001). Anti-r/hCRH had no effect on plasma immunoreactive ACTH or beta-endorphin. Plasma immunoreactive ACTH and corticosterone levels were decreased in the group treated with anti-hACTH (P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). We conclude that 1) beta-endorphin immune neutralization is associated with a survival advantage during severe surgical stress, suggesting that circulating beta-endorphin might have deleterious effects during stress; 2) In severe stress, acute immune neutralization of CRH is not sufficient to inhibit ACTH, beta-endorphin, and corticosterone secretion, suggesting significant involvement of other secretagogues of the pituitary-adrenal axis; and 3) moderate decreases in corticosterone cannot affect survival, presumably because glucocorticoids play only a permissive role in maintaining cardiovascular stability during surgical stress.\r"

  ".W": "The opioid peptide methionine-enkephalin (Met-enkephalin) was measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sheep in which the cisterna magna, carotid artery, and jugular vein were chronically cannulated. Venous blood plasma and CSF were collected before and after stress treatment and in control studies in conscious animals. Plasma and CSF were extracted with octadecylsilica and oxidized, and Met-enkephalin was measured as its Met-sulfoxide derivative by specific RIA. The molecular form of immunoreactive Met-enkephalin was characterized by peptide size exclusion chromatography of an octadecylsilica extract of sheep plasma through Bio-Gel P2, followed by reverse phase liquid chromatography, and was identical to Met-enkephalin and Met-sulfoxide-enkephalin. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia produced an elevation of plasma cortisol and an increase in the plasma concentration of Met-enkephalin. Acute hemorrhage led to an earlier and greater rise in plasma cortisol than that associated with insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but did not increase the concentration of Met-enkephalin in plasma. Neither form of acute stress increased the concentration of Met-enkephalin in CSF. These studies confirm that secretion of Met-enkephalin into blood can be dissociated from stimulation of the pituitary-adrenocortical system. They also show that circulating Met-enkephalin is elevated in conscious sheep during acute hypoglycemic stress, but plasma Met-enkephalin is unlikely to exert effects on the opiate receptors of periaqueductal or spinal nociceptive neurons under these conditions, since it does not enter cerebrospinal fluid in significant amounts.\r"

A peptide extracted from the skin of the Australian frog Crinia georgiana has been purified, has been determined to have the amino acid sequence of [Ala-Pro-Gly-(Ile3-Val5)]angiotensin II, and recently has been synthesized. We studied the renal effect of synthetic frog skin angiotensin II (FSAII) infused via the renal artery in doses that were confined to the kidney. FSAII was infused intrarenally at 0.2, 2, and 4 pmol/kg.min in uninephrectomized conscious dogs (n = 5) in metabolic balance at a sodium intake of 80 meq/day. FSAII was confined to the kidney, as demonstrated by the absence of any systemic pressor response and/or any increase in plasma aldosterone concentrations during intrarenal FSAII infusion at rats of 0.2 and 2 pmol/kg.min. At 4 pmol/kg.min, FSAII traversed the kidney in amounts sufficient to stimulate aldosterone secretion (P less than 0.05). All three doses of FSAII caused significant antidiuresis and antinatriuresis, and decreased fractional excretion of sodium. There were no changes in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or renal plasma flow (RPF) during FSAII infusion at 0.2 and 2 pmol/kg.min. At 4 pmol/kg.min, FSAII engendered a significant decrease in GFR and RPF, while the filtration fraction increased. There were no significant changes in arterial blood pressure at any dose of FSAII. When confined to the kidney, FSAII caused antidiuresis and anti-natriuresis in the absence of a change in GFR and RPF. These results provide evidence that angiotensin acts directly at the renal tubular level to alter renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a GnRH antagonist (GnRHA) on GnRH agonist (GnRH*)-induced androgen production and spermatogonial multiplication were studied in the frog, Rana esculenta, in vivo and in vitro. Intact and hypophysectomized (PDX) animals were kept at 22 +/- 2 C and treated with GnRH (45 ng/g BW) and GnRH* plus 1X and 10X concentrations of GnRHA on alternate days for 2 weeks. Androgen concentration in GnRH* plus GnRHA-treated animals decreased in the testis by about 50% with the 10X dose whereas the increase obtained in GnRH*-treated PDX group was completely abolished with the 1X dose. Histological sections were evaluated with respect of the mitotic index (MI) of the primary spermatogonia. Both GnRHA-treated intact and PDX frogs showed a dose-dependent MI decrease which reached 59% and 57% of control, respectively. In vitro incubations were carried out on testis halves at 15 C for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h with the addition of 1 microgram GnRH* and 1 microgram GnRH* plus 1 or 10 micrograms GnRHA. The stimulatory effect of GnRH* and the inhibitory effect of GnRHA were apparent within 2 h. The basal mitogenic activity was affected by antagonist treatment and the inhibitory effect on the MI was evident within 2-4 h in the 10X-treated groups or within 6-8 h in the 1X treated groups. Since GnRH* and GnRHA bind to the same receptor these data strongly indicate that the effects of putative GnRH-like materials in the frog, Rana esculenta, are mediated throughout stereospecific recognition sites in both pituitary and testis.\r"

The concentration of CA-125 was significantly higher in stages III + IV (66.6 +/- 22.0 [standard deviation] U/ml) than in stage I (20.9 +/- 2.3 U/ml) or II (28.4 +/- 2.8 U/ml); in stage II, the concentration was higher than in stage I. Surgical elimination of endometriosis significantly decreased the level of CA-125, as did danazol, but not medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), although these drugs were equal in clinical efficacy. The CA-125 changes during hormonal treatment did not correlate with the clinical response. Postoperatively, CA-125 responses to danazol, MPA, or placebo did not differ significantly from each other. During the 6-month follow-up after medication, the CA-125 concentrations tended to increase, especially in danazol-treated women. The determination of CA-125 is useful in estimating the extent of the disease, but it is less valuable in monitoring the treatment effect. The ability of danazol to suppress CA-125 expression emphasizes the specific properties of this drug.\r"

These parameters were compared with those of a group of normal volunteers (n = 18). The authors found significant differences between endometriosis patients and controls in follicular growth rate and total growth period. The effect of patients' clomiphene citrate usage on growth parameters in these patients was examined. Abnormalities in interrelationships between the growth parameters were detected, suggesting the possibility of subtle defects in the regulation of follicular growth in these patients.\r"

The latter technique consisted of a primed-constant infusion of [3-3H]glucose followed by the administration of an oral glucose load (mean +/- SE, 90.7 +/- 0.7 g) containing [1-14C]glucose. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were similar in young and elderly subjects, but in the elderly, glucose tolerance was markedly impaired. Although in the elderly the initial rise in insulin levels (delta, i.e., the incremental area under the curve) from 0 to 30 min was delayed (P less than .02), the response from 0 to 45 min, 0 to 60 min, and thereafter equaled that in the young group, and from 90 to 240 min insulin concentrations in the elderly exceeded those in young subjects. Basal hepatic glucose output (HGO) was similar in young and elderly men (2.13 +/- 0.10 and 1.97 +/- 0.14 mg.kg-1.min-1, respectively). Similar proportional reductions in HGO from 0 to 270 min after glucose loading occurred in young (59.7 +/- 10.3%) and elderly (50.3 +/- 4.9%) subjects but was delayed in the elderly. Suppression of HGO was observed in the young 30 min after glucose ingestion (P less than .02), but not before 60 min in the elderly subjects (P less than .05). The systemic appearance of ingested glucose (0-270 min) was slowed with age (80.7 +/- 3.1 and 66.9 +/- 4.3% of the oral load in the young and elderly groups, respectively; P less than .02). Initial increments in both total glucose disappearance (Rd) and forearm glucose uptake (FGU) from 0 to 60 min after glucose loading were decreased in the elderly (Rd, 4.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 11.5 +/- 1.3 g, P less than .001; FGU, 17.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 24.6 +/- 2.5 md/dl forearm, P less than .02). The overall increment (delta, 0-270 min) in Rd was reduced with age (47.2 +/- 2.9 and 34.5 +/- 3.6 g, P less than .02 in the young and elderly, respectively), but the corresponding data for FGU were similar in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The electron-microscopic investigation revealed two characteristics indicative of ongoing islet cell destruction. In all islets investigated, lysed islet beta-cells were recognized by disrupted plasma membranes and concomitantly decreased plasma contrast. Many of the lysed islet beta-cells still contained numerous insulin granules. We also found immunocytes scattered throughout the islets, most of which could be identified as macrophages. Some were found engaged in phagocytosis of islet beta-cell debris. This early stage of islet lesion termed single-cell insulitis is followed by the well-known later stage of massive infiltration easily recognized in light microscopy. Administration of silica particles to mice treated with low-dose streptozocin inhibited macrophage infiltration of islets as shown by immunocytochemistry with macrophage-specific monoclonal antibody F4/80. In parallel, the development of hyperglycemia was suppressed. The observations favor a pathogenic role of macrophages in islet destruction.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the effect of two drugs [etomoxir and nicotinic acid (NA)] on plasma glucose, free-fatty acid (FFA), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations was determined in rats with streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The two compounds modify FFA metabolism by different mechanisms, etomoxir (ethyl-2-[6-(4-cholorophenoxyl)-hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate) by inhibiting hepatic fatty acid oxidation, and NA by inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing approximately 400 g, by STZ injection (30 mg/kg i.v.), and the metabolic effects of the two drugs were studied 7-10 days later. The acute administration of either etomoxir or NA lowered plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic rats by approximately 150 mg/dl (P less than .001) in 4 h. However, the two drugs differed dramatically in their effects on plasma FFA and TG concentrations. Specifically, etomoxir produced striking increases in plasma FFA and TG concentrations, whereas NA administration caused a marked decrease. However, when NA was given in conjunction with etomoxir, NA prevented the increase in plasma FFA and TG concentration seen with etomoxir; the combination of NA and etomoxir approximately doubled the decrease in plasma glucose concentration produced by NA or etomoxir when given alone. Because plasma insulin concentrations did not change in response to either drug, whether administered singly or in combination, these metabolic effects do not result from a change in insulin secretion. These results suggest that modulation of FFA metabolism at the level of the adipocyte or the liver can have dramatic effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\r"

The hormone, at physiologic concentrations (1-10 ng/ml), was found to stimulate active K+ transport into these cells, the effect being mediated via the Na+-K+ pump. Alterations in insulin-receptor status by treatment of cells with glucocorticoids or exposure to subphysiologic pH was reflected in parallel changes in the sensitivity of the K+-uptake process to the hormone. We conclude that insulin can directly affect the metabolism of bone cells and that the hormone's action on transmembrane ion transport may be linked to interaction with its cell surface receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether clonidine exerts its action within the central nervous system or outside the central nervous system to induce hyperglycemia, we compared the effects of clonidine injected into the third cerebral ventricle or intravenously on hepatic venous plasma glucose concentrations in fasted rats. Clonidine administration produced a dose-dependent hyperglycemia in each case. At all tested doses (5, 50, and 100 nmol) the hyperglycemic responses to clonidine injected intravenously were not significantly different from those to clonidine injected into the third cerebral ventricle. Intraperitoneal pretreatment with yohimbine (50 nmol) or phentolamine (50 nmol), both alpha-adrenergic antagonists, reduced the hyperglycemic response to clonidine (100 nmol) given intravenously, but these antagonists preinjected into the third cerebral ventricle did not reduce the response. Moreover, no significant differences in venous plasma clonidine concentrations were observed when intravenous and third cerebral ventricle injections of clonidine (100 nmol) were compared. These results suggest that clonidine-induced hyperglycemia is mainly mediated by the peripheral mechanism rather than through the central mechanism. To gain an insight into the peripheral mechanism for the hyperglycemic action of clonidine, we measured the plasma immunoreactive glucagon and insulin concentrations after intravenous clonidine (100 nmol). We found that plasma immunoreactive glucagon concentrations significantly increased, whereas plasma immunoreactive insulin concentrations did not change significantly despite hyperglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism(s) of the immunological reactions involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia induced by multiple intraperitoneal injections of subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin (STZ) in mice remains to be elucidated. We found that STZ can act as a hapten in vivo by using the popliteal lymph node (PLN) assay. With this assay a direct toxic effect of STZ on the pancreatic beta-cells was dissociated from the effects exerted on the immune system. Subcutaneous injections of STZ induced immune reactivity in the draining PLN as determined by increase in weight, cell number, and [3H]thymidine incorporation. T-lymphocytes were required to induce the PLN response to STZ, because athymic nu/nu mice completely failed to respond to STZ, in contrast to their euthymic +/nu counterparts (P less than .001). The STZ-induced PLN response was sex independent and unaffected by prior subcutaneous injections of 3-O-methylglucose known to protect pancreatic beta-cells against STZ. STZ-primed mice exhibited an accelerated and enhanced STZ-specific secondary PLN response on challenge with subimmunogenic doses of STZ. In adoptive transfer experiments, STZ-sensitized splenic lymphocytes enriched for T-lymphocytes induced an STZ-specific significant (P less than .005) PLN enlargement provided the syngeneic recipients had been pretreated with subimmunogenic doses of STZ. Presumably, such STZ-specific immune reactions enhance a subtoxic effect of STZ on the pancreatic beta-cells.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of the minimal secretory capacity of pancreatic beta-cells for the stability of the plasma glucose level was studied in 20 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Changes in plasma concentrations of major counterregulatory hormones in response to hypoglycemia were also investigated in these patients to clarify their contribution to diabetic brittleness. beta-Cell function was evaluated on the basis of elevation of plasma C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) during the intravenous glucagon test with a highly sensitive assay for plasma CPR that could detect as little as 0.03 ng/ml. After stimulation with glucagon, a significant increase in plasma CPR was observed in 10 of the patients whose beta-cell function had been evaluated as completely depleted by a conventional assay for plasma CPR. A clear inverse correlation was found between the secretory capacity of pancreatic beta-cells measured in this way and the degree of glycemic instability (r = -.74, P less than .01). Infusion of insulin at a rate of 0.15 U.kg-1.h-1 for 60 min caused a continuous decrease in the plasma glucose level, resulting in neuroglycopenia in 7 of the 10 CPR nonresponders but only 2 of the CPR responders. During insulin-induced hypoglycemia, plasma glucagon immunoreactivity did not increase in the CPR nonresponders but increased significantly in the CPR responders. A positive correlation was found between the minimal residual beta-cell capacity and the responsiveness of alpha-cells to hypoglycemia (r = .65, P less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The glucose-induced insulin secretion was significantly decreased in isolated pancreatic islets incubated with hydroxylamine plus arsenite. Light and electron microscopy, pyroantimonate technique, and X-ray microanalysis disclosed mitochondrial damage, degeneration, and necrosis among the beta-cells in the islets of mice injected with hydroxylamine plus arsenite. Glycogen depletion and microvesicular fatty change were seen in the liver of mice treated with fluoroacetate, arsenite, or hydroxylamine plus arsenite. These observations support the view that inhibition of the activity of citric acid cycle enzymes and associated reactions in the beta-cells play a role in the induction of diabetic features.\r"

  ".W": "Islet cell antibodies (ICAs), thyrogastric antibodies, and HLA-DR antigens were determined in 204 patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes controlled with diet and/or oral hypoglycemic agents (NIR) and in 108 age-matched patients who required insulin to control their hyperglycemia (IR). beta-Cell function measured as C-peptide response to glucagon was evaluated in relation to the presence of ICAs and HLA-DR antigens. The IR patients differed from the NIR patients with respect to higher frequency of ICAs (P less than .001), thyroid antibodies (P less than .02), and the HLA antigen DR4 (P less than .02). The highest frequency of ICAs and thyroid antibodies was observed in female insulin-treated subjects (51.2 and 46.4%). Patients who were heterozygous for HLA-DR3/DR4 showed significantly higher frequency of ICAs (P less than .01) and complement-fixing ICAs (P less than .001) than patients without the heterozygous form DR3/DR4. Neither the presence of ICA alone nor DR3/DR4 alone was associated with a significant impairment of beta-cell function. However, when both ICA and DR3/DR4 were present in a diabetic individual, beta-cell function was markedly impaired (P less than .001), suggesting that both genetic and autoimmune factors are necessary to facilitate the process leading to beta-cell destruction of the patients. Our findings suggest that type II diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder including at least two major subgroups, which can be further characterized by HLA-DR antigens and organ-specific antibodies.\r"

Thirty-four patients had detectable HBsAg, and 21 had viral multiplication at the time of transplantation. Serial HBV DNA determinations performed in 57 of 90 patients disclosed (a) reactivation of HBV replication in 11 of 12 HBsAg-positive patients, (b) increase of viral replication when positive on the initial sample in 6 of 11 patients, and (c) development of HBV replication in 7 of 35 of the HBsAg-negative patients. Moreover, liver HBV DNA studies showed a statistical correlation between the presence of integrated liver HBV DNA and chronic hepatitis in HBsAg-negative patients. This study demonstrates prospectively the significant association of HBsAg-positive as well as HBsAg-negative HBV infection with chronic hepatitis and suggests that immunosuppressive therapy may enhance the viral replication in both HBsAg-positive and negative subjects.\r"

Follow-up studies were available in a limited number of patients with early alcoholic liver disease showing progression or improvement paralleling alcohol use. Using this method, ultrasound may have considerable potential in the diagnosis and follow-up of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Its pathogenesis, clinical significance, and ultimate prognosis remain uncertain. We therefore studied the origin of biliary sludge ultrasonic echoes, using an ex vivo liver-gallbladder preparation, and determined the outcome of a group of patients identified to have gallbladder sludge by ultrasonography. Echoes were not generated by either an increase in the total solid concentration or by the graded addition of partially purified mucus glycoprotein. Cholesterol monohydrate crystals (greater than 50 micron) mixed with mucus produced echoes that were indistinguishable from gallbladder sludge observed in patients. To determine the natural evolution of gallbladder sludge in patients, we prospectively followed 96 patients found to have biliary sludge for a mean of 37.8 mo by serial ultrasound scans every 6 mo. In 17 patients (17.7%) biliary sludge disappeared and did not recur for at least 2 yr, in 58 patients (60.4%) biliary sludge disappeared and reappeared, and in 8 patients (8.3%) asymptomatic gallstones developed. There were 12 cholecystectomies performed: six were done for symptomatic gallstones (6.3%) and the other six for sludge associated with severe biliary pain attacks with or without recurrent acute pancreatitis. The finding of sludge represented precipitates being formed in bile. In some patients, it was a precursor form of gallstone disease.\r"

To determine the effect of more prolonged administration of the inhibitor on gastrointestinal function and carbohydrate tolerance, we studied 6 non-insulin-dependent diabetics (3 previously treated with oral agents and 3 treated with diet alone) for 3 wk while they ate a weight-maintenance diet. Patients taking oral agents continued them during the first week. During the second week, 4-6 g of the inhibitor was given with each meal. Capillary blood glucose concentration was measured before each meal and 90 min postprandially. On the last day of each week venous blood samples for glucose, hormones, and lactic acid analysis and a quantitative stool culture were obtained. Total carbohydrate absorption was estimated by comparing postprandial breath hydrogen on study days 7, 14, and 21 with breath hydrogen after ingesting 15 g of lactulose on days 0, 15, and 22. There 24-h stools were collected and weighed at the end of each week and analyzed for carbohydrate, lactic acid, short-chain fatty acids, pH, dry matter, amylase, and fat. The inhibitor significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced postprandial plasma glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide concentrations, significantly increased (p less than 0.05) breath hydrogen excretion, and caused carbohydrate malabsorption. Diarrhea occurred the first day the inhibitor was ingested, but thereafter cessation of diarrhea was associated with changes in the metabolism of carbohydrate by colonic flora. As the amylase inhibitor improves carbohydrate homeostasis and is not associated with continuing diarrhea, it may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Only 2 of the young patients showed no markers of current or past hepatitis B infection compared with 31 (14.3%) of the older patients (p less than 0.001). Hepatitis B surface antigen was present in 81.5% of the young patients and of these 34.5% were e antigen-positive. The corresponding figures in the older patients were 29.8% and 10.9% (p less than 0.001 in each instance). It is concluded that whereas the association between hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis B infection is almost universal in young blacks, a subgroup of older blacks shows no evidence of ever having been infected with this virus.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we have conducted a double-blind, controlled, crossover clinical trial of rifampin, an agent that inhibits hepatic bile acid uptake and may detoxify hepatic bile acids by stimulation of mixed-function oxidases. Nine patients with primary biliary cirrhosis received 300-450 mg/day of rifampin and placebo sequentially, in random order. Each treatment was administered for 14 days, with a 14-day washout between treatments. Endpoints included patient preference, changes in a daily visual analogue scale pruritus score, and amount of cholestyramine ingested. Antipyrine elimination rates and serum bile acids were tested at the end of each treatment period. All 9 patients completed the trial and 8 of them preferred rifampin to placebo (p = 0.03). There were no adverse reactions. Visual analogue scale pruritus scores showed no significant placebo response or any effect from the order of treatment, but did show a highly significant reduction in pruritus in response to rifampin (p less than 0.002). This effect was evident within the first week of rifampin treatment. Rifampin produced a 33% reduction in antipyrine plasma half-life, but no change in fasting total serum bile acids. Cholestyramine usage did not change significantly. We conclude that rifampin is useful for short-term relief of pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis; however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Longer trials are needed, as are trials in other cholestatic disorders.\r"

Over the past two decades, many experimental studies have delineated the specific problems surrounding small-bowel transplantation and provided strategies for their control. Control of rejection, the most difficult problem, may be achieved with a combination of cyclosporine, azathioprine, prednisone, antithymocyte globulin, and monoclonal antibodies. The threat of graft-versus-host disease originating from the allogeneic lymphatic tissues in the allograft is abolished by in vitro x-irradiation of the cold, nonperfused graft with 1000 rads. Monitoring of the intestinal allograft is possible with the combination of a function test (maltose absorption, glucose absorption, or any other function test) and repeated graft biopsy. Effective short-term preservation of small-bowel segments for up to 18 h is possible by intravascular flushing with a balanced electrolyte solution containing 3% fructose and by subsequent hypothermic storage. Clinical small-bowel transplantation is certainly not an imminent therapeutic tool. However, clinical trials in highly selected patients could be envisioned on the basis of our present understanding of small-bowel transplantation and of transplantation biology in general, and in view of the clinical successes achieved with duodenal grafts transplanted in conjunction with pancreatic grafts.\r"

Congestive heart failure, a common sequela to myocardial infarction, is currently best treated by diuretics and vasodilating drugs. These therapies are generally well-tolerated by the elderly. Digitalis, which is not easily given to the elderly due to potential toxicity, is probably best avoided in this patient group unless needed to treat arrhythmia. Careful differential diagnosis of congestive heart failure is a critical pre-condition to starting any therapy for heart failure, particularly in the elderly patient.\r"

The incidence of venographically proved postoperative deep-vein thrombosis was 52 per cent in the placebo group and 25 per cent in the dihydroergotamine mesylate/heparin sodium group (p = 0.002). Proximal thrombi developed in only 5 per cent and extensive thrombi, in only 10 per cent of the patients who received dihydroergotamine mesylate/heparin sodium. In contrast, proximal thrombi and extensive thrombi developed in 19 and 25 per cent, respectively, of the patients in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Adverse reactions in the two groups did not differ significantly: in the treatment group they consisted primarily of hematoma at the site of injection (9 per cent), hematoma at the wound (5 per cent), and excessive postoperative bleeding, and in the placebo group there was hematoma at the site of injection (3 per cent). It was concluded that the combination agent dihydroergotamine mesylate/heparin sodium was effective and safe prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis for the patients who underwent total hip replacement in this study.\r"

Thirteen of the fractures were extra-articular and seven were intra-articular. Seven fractures had been open and nine had been associated with multiple trauma. Eight had been initially treated by open reduction and internal fixation; five, by closed reduction and immobilization; four, by skeletal traction; two, by external fixation; and one, by debridement and immobilization. The average time from the original fracture to the treatment of the non-union was twenty months (range, three to 120 months). All but one patient had pain and instability, and fifteen (75 per cent) had limited motion of the elbow. Radiographically, eleven were considered to have a reactive non-union and nine, a non-reactive non-union. Seventeen (94 per cent) of the eighteen non-unions ultimately united. Two patients underwent excision of the distal end of the humerus and replacement with an allograft. At follow-up (average, 3.6 years), function in one patient was rated as excellent; in six, as good; in seven, as fair; and in six, as poor. The patients who had an extra-articular supracondylar non-union had the best over-all results, while those who had a non-union that was associated with an intra-articular component or severe soft-tissue trauma did less well. It should be emphasized, however, that most of the patients in this study continued to have a major long-term disability, despite the fact that union was successful.\r"

The 0.03 microgram/kg oCRH dose produced a reproducible response, with a rapid increase in plasma oCRH to peak levels between 45 and 95 fmol/mL and an appropriate doubling of plasma peptide and corticosteroid concentrations. The relationship between the corticosteroid rise and the rapid beta End/beta LPH and ACTH declines suggested negative feedback by corticosteroids on the release of these pituitary products. Plasma oCRH levels were proportionate to those reported in studies using much higher oCRH doses, and produced plasma oCRH levels in the reported range for the hypophyseal portal circulation. Molecular sieving of the beta End-immunoreactive materials in basal and post-oCRH (0.1 microgram/kg) plasma samples revealed an average basal beta End to beta LPH ratio of 1:1.5; 15 min after oCRH stimulation the average ratio was 4:1. We conclude that a low (threshold) dose of oCRH can reliably stimulate POMC peptide secretion and may preferentially release beta End from the anterior pituitary.\r"

Accordingly, radionuclide left ventricular angiograms and simultaneous metabolic profiles were obtained in 8 type I diabetic patients who had no major diabetic complications and in 11 normal subjects. Occult coronary artery disease was excluded by electrocardiogram exercise testing. Hemodynamics and systolic function did not differ between the groups. However, the peak filling rate (PFR; end-diastolic volumes per s) was less in the diabetic patients at rest [mean, 4.1 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) vs. 4.8 +/- 0.2; P less than 0.05] and during aerobic (6.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 8.30 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.01) and anaerobic exercise (8.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.4; P less than 0.05). The time to PFR was prolonged in the diabetic patients at rest (174 +/- 10 vs. 133 +/- 7 ms; P less than 0.01) and during anaerobic exercise (126 +/- 5 vs. 103 +/- 6 ms; P less than 0.01). Plasma glucose and insulin levels were elevated in the diabetic patients at rest and during exercise. Otherwise, the metabolic and hormonal levels did not differ between the groups. In the diabetic patients, no single metabolic or hormonal parameter correlated with PFR or time to PFR. Impairment of diastolic filling also did not correlate with level of glycosylated hemoglobin or duration of diabetes. The alteration in diastolic filling present in type I diabetic patients who have no other diabetic complications may represent the earliest functional effect of diabetic cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Some patients with the insulin autoimmune syndrome have circulating insulin that is heterogeneous. We used reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis to identify the forms of plasma insulin in patients with this syndrome and compared the results with those in patients with insulin-treated diabetes and patients with hyperinsulinism. Under acidic conditions, free insulin dissociated from insulin antibodies eluted from Bio-Gel P-30 columns as a single peak. When such insulin fractions were applied to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, a major insulin peak emerged with the same retention time as standard human insulin in all six patients with the syndrome. In addition, a minor insulin peak was consistently found at relatively high acetonitrile concentrations. However, this hydrophobic insulin also was found in two of four insulin-treated diabetic patients and in one of two hyperinsulinemic patients who did not have insulin antibodies. Preliminary characterization of the variant insulin revealed that it has a molecular size between those of proinsulin and insulin and retains the immunoreactivity of insulin, but not C-peptide. It may be an aggregate of insulin molecule or proinsulin intermediates. Since the variant insulin was not found only in patients with the insulin autoimmune syndrome, it seems unlikely that an altered endogenously produced insulin induces the generation of autoantibodies to insulin in this syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "88087736\r", 
  ".W": "The human secretory phase endometrium synthesizes and secrets a 34K insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein designated placental protein 12. We now report that membrane preparations of human endometrium possess IGF receptors that complete with the soluble binding protein for binding to IGF-I. Multiplication-stimulating activity and insulin were 1% and 0.1% as potent as recombinant (Thr59)IGF-I in inhibiting the binding of [125I](Thr59)IGF-I to endometrial membranes. Scatchard plots for the IGF-I binding data were curvilinear, and the apparent affinities [Ka = 1.4 +/- 0.2 ( +/- SEM) X 10(9) M-1] for (Thr59)IGF-I (high affinity site) did not change during the menstrual cycle. Affinity cross-linking of [125I](Thr59)IGF-I to endometrial membranes revealed two major bands with mol wt of 130K and 260K on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The 130K band is consistent with the alpha-subunit of the type I IGF receptor. The 260K band is either the type II IGF receptor or represents cross-linking (dimer) of two alpha-subunits of the type I receptor. A less intense band at about 40K was also seen in all membrane preparations. It comigrated with the cross-linked purified 34K binding protein. The band was more intensely labeled when the tracer was cross-linked to proteins in the cytosol fractions of late secretory phase endometria. By specific RIA, the 34K binding protein was detected in the cytosol of late secretory phase endometria only. Newly synthesized binding protein, which contaminated membrane preparations, caused an apparent increase in the binding of (Thr59)IGF-I to the membranes prepared from late secretory phase endometria when studied by competitive binding assay. In contrast, purified binding protein prevented the binding of [125I](Thr59)IGF-I to membrane receptors, as confirmed by affinity cross-linking. These results suggest that the 34K IGF-binding protein, secreted by the human endometrium in a cyclic fashion, has a significant role in inhibiting the receptor binding and, thus, the possible biological action of IGF-I in the endometrium in an autocrine/paracrine manner.\r"

One group (n = 26) received 0.3 mg, and the other (n = 25) received 0.6 mg. Both cabergoline doses induced a significant fall in serum PRL levels, which lasted, on the average, from 3 h to 5 days after 0.3 mg and from 3 h to 14 days after 0.6 mg; the mean maximum decrease after 0.3 mg was -65 +/-4% (+/- SEM), significantly (P less than 0.05) less than that after bromocriptine (group mean, -73 +/- 4%), and it was -76 +/- 3% after 0.6 mg, not significantly different from that induced by bromocriptine (group mean, -71 +/- 4%). The effect of 0.6 mg cabergoline was significantly greater than that of 0.3 mg (P less than 0.01). In a second study designed to evaluate the possible therapeutic use of the new drug, 0.3 or 0.6 mg cabergoline was administered orally once weekly for 9 weeks to 2 groups of 15 and 16 hyperprolactinemic patients, respectively. Serum PRL levels fell significantly by the first week and reached a plateau after 2 doses in the 0.6 mg cabergoline-treated group and after 5 doses in the 0.3 mg-treated group; the absolute PRL decrease was greater in the former. Ten patients in each group achieved normal serum PRL levels, and a marked decrease (greater than 50% of pretreatment values) occurred in all patients treated with 0.6 mg and in 13 treated with 0.3 mg weekly. Resumption of menses occurred during the treatment period in 15 of the 17 premenopausal women with amenorrhea. Six patients who had poor responses had better responses when given higher drug doses for 4 weeks, and serum PRL levels became normal in the 3 receiving 0.6 mg twice weekly. These data confirm that cabergoline is a long-acting oral dopaminergic drug and suggest that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of patients with hyperprolactinemia.\r"

To further characterize the role of adrenergic transmission in the regulation of GH release, the effects of combined administration of clonidine and insulin were investigated in 16 normal men randomly assigned to 2 groups. The first group received 0.1 U/kg regular insulin, iv, followed by placebo or clonidine (0.150 mg), orally, on 2 different days, 2 weeks apart. The second group received oral clonidine (0.150 mg), followed by iv placebo or insulin (0.1 U/kg) on 2 different days, 2 weeks apart. Insulin induced a clear-cut increase in plasma GH (F = 79.88; P less than 0.001) that was not affected by placebo, whereas it was significantly inhibited by oral clonidine (P less than 0.001 at 60, 90, and 120 min). Similarly, oral clonidine administration resulted in a clear-cut rise in plasma GH levels (F = 16.44; P less than 0.001) that was significantly reduced by insulin (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.02, and P less than 0.05 at 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively). These results suggest that while moderate activation of the alpha 2-adrenergic system stimulates GH release, further stimulation of the same system may result in inhibition, rather than further activation, of GH secretion.\r"

The existence of these similarities also suggests the existence of a developmental intermediate cell type which has the potential to produce and secrete both hPRL and hGH. We have applied reverse hemolytic plaque assays to monitor the secretions of individual fetal human pituitary cells to determine if any of these cells secrete both hPRL and hGH. When hPRL and hGH assays were performed sequentially on cells obtained from five fetuses of 18-22 weeks gestational age, we consistently found a subpopulation of cells that formed plaques in both assays, i.e. they secreted both hPRL and hGH. The majority of fetal cells secreting hPRL also secreted hGH at this stage of development. These data were corroborated with light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical localization of hPRL and hGH in a subpopulation of previously identified fetal somatotrophs. These findings suggest that in addition to the classical somatotrophs and lactotrophs, the fetal human pituitary contains an additional cell type which secretes both hPRL and hGH. The dual hormone-secreting cell may represent a common progenitor of these classical cell types. It also may be the cell of origin of those pituitary tumors that secrete both PRL and GH.\r"

  ".W": "Suppression of gonadal sex steroid secretion in children with central precocious puberty (CPP) by LHRH analogs affords an opportunity to study sex steroid modulation of GH and somatomedin-C (Sm-C) secretion and to examine the role of GH and Sm-C in pubertal and prepubertal statural growth. Nocturnal serum GH and plasma Sm-C levels were measured in 10 preadrenarchal girls [mean age, 3.0 +/- 0.6] ( +/- SEM) yr with CPP before and during 2 yr of LHRH analog-induced gonadal suppression. Their mean height velocity, initially 4.6 +/- 0.6 ( +/- SEM) SD above the mean for chronological age, decreased to -0.1 +/- 0.4 SD during 12-24 months of ovarian suppression (P less than 0.00005). The mean peak nocturnal plasma GH level was 22.5 +/- 5.4 ( +/- SEM) micrograms/L during puberty, and it decreased to 10.2 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L after 3 months of suppression of gonadarche. This decrease persisted throughout the 2 yr of gonadal suppression (P less than 0.05). The reduction in GH secretion was accompanied by a decrease in mean plasma Sm-C levels from 3.5 +/- 0.7 to 1.5 +/- 0.2 U/mL after 3 months of suppression of gonadal sex steroids, which persisted during 2 yr of gonadal suppression (P less than 0.01). Suppression of ovarian function in girls with CPP results in decreased height velocity. This slowing of growth occurs in association with decreased nocturnal serum GH and plasma Sm-C levels, suggesting that acceleration of growth during puberty is partially mediated by sex steroid-induced augmentation of GH secretion.\r"

Normally this stimulus increases plasma cortisol, GH, aldosterone, and PRA. Administration of captopril resulted in a blunted plasma aldosterone response to hypoglycemia, but no concomitant blunting of the plasma cortisol response. The responses of other hormones, with the exception of PRA, were not affected. When exogenous ACTH was administered to the same men with and without captopril, the plasma aldosterone response was again blunted by captopril, while the plasma cortisol response was unaffected. We conclude that angiotensin II may be required for ACTH to stimulate aldosterone secretion. Alternatively, the possibility that captopril may selectively inhibit aldosterone secretion at the adrenal cellular level cannot be excluded.\r"

In the DHEA group serum DHEA-S levels rose 2.5- to 3.5-fold, and mean (+/- SEM) serum androstenedione rose from 4.3 +/- 0.6 to 8.6 +/- 1.2 nmol/L (P less than 0.004, by paired t test), but serum total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, and estrone levels did not change. In the DHEA group the mean percent body fat decreased by 31%, with no change in weight. This suggests that the reduction in fat mass was coupled with an increase in muscle mass. DHEA administration also resulted in a fall in mean serum total cholesterol concentration (4.82 +/- 0.21 vs. 4.48 +/- 0.29 nmol/L; P less than 0.05), which was due almost entirely to a fall of 7.5% in mean serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.21 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.97 +/- 0.14 nmol/L; P less than 0.01). No changes in anthropometric parameters or serum lipid levels occurred in the placebo group. Tissue sensitivity to insulin, assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, did not change in either the placebo or DHEA groups. These results suggest that in normal men DHEA administration reduces body fat, increases muscle mass, and reduces serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Tissue sensitivity to insulin was unaffected by short term DHEA administration.\r"

  ".U": "88087761\r", 
  ".W": "Human uterine tissue can synthesize leukotrienes and prostacyclin (PGI2) from arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways, respectively. Leukotriene C4 stimulates myometrial and vascular smooth muscle contractions, whereas PGI2 inhibits them. In addition, these eicosanoids have other actions in uterine tissue. All of these actions are possibly mediated by specific receptors, but such receptors have not been demonstrated in human uterine tissue. Therefore, these quantitative light microscopic autoradiographic studies were undertaken to determine whether nonpregnant human uterine tissue contains specific leukotriene C4- and PGI2-binding sites. Studies with [3H]leukotriene C4 indicated that luminal epithelial cells of the endometrium, stromal cells, elongated and circular myometrial smooth muscle, and arteriolar smooth muscle contained numerous binding sites. Glandular epithelium, vascular endothelium, and erythrocytes, on the other hand, contained few or no leukotriene C4-binding sites. The number of binding sites in luminal epithelial cells of the endometrium was as high as that in lung, which is a rich source of these binding sites. The number of binding sites in these epithelial cells was higher (P less than 0.05) than that in stromal cells, circular myometrial smooth muscle, and arteriolar smooth muscle, but there were no significant (P greater than 0.05) differences among other cells. Maximal binding occurred at 5 min of incubation at 22 or 38 C. The presence of serine borate, a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, in the incubation medium resulted in a small to moderate increase in leukotriene C4 binding to uterine cells. Binding to the cells was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced after coincubation with excess unlabeled leukotriene C4, but not with excess unlabeled leukotriene A4, leukotriene B4, leukotriene D4, leukotriene E4, prostaglandin (PG) E1, PGF2a, or PGI2. Studies with [3H]PGI2 demonstrated that while myometrium and vascular smooth muscle contained PGI2-specific binding sites, endometrium and vascular endothelium contained very few or no binding sites. Elongated myometrial smooth muscle contained a higher number of binding sites than circular myometrial smooth muscle and vascular smooth muscle (P less than 0.01). PGI2 binding to the uterine cells was dependent on the time and temperature of incubation, and Ca2+ was not required for binding. Coincubation with unlabeled PGI2, but not with its stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1a, resulted in a significant reduction (P less than 0.001) of binding to uterine cells. PGE2, PGF2a, and leukotriene C4 also had no effect on [3H]PGI2 binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the existence of heterogeneity of beta-type myosin isozymes (HC beta) in human hearts, immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) raised against human ventricular myosin heavy chains were performed. Two types of MoAbs recognized some muscle fibers in the atrium, whereas both reacted with all ventricular muscle fibers. Since atrial muscle fibers reactive with each MoAb were found to be clearly different, the existence of two immunologically distinct HC beta (beta 1, and beta 2) was suggested in the atrium. By using affinity chromatography, two molecular variants of HC beta were isolated from the bovine atrium, and differences in the primary structure of beta 1 and beta 2 were confirmed by analysis of peptides produced by chymotryptic digestion. In pressure-overloaded human atria, myofibers containing beta 1 and/or beta 2 increased in accordance with decrement of myofibers containing alpha-type myosin isozyme (P less than 0.01). But they differed in expression during the developmental stage, since beta 2 did not exist in the early embryonic bovine heart, but beta 1 did. Thus, there are two distinct HC beta whose expression is regulated by at least two factors: pressure overload and developmental stage.\r"

  ".U": "88087891\r", 
  ".W": "Aging in men and rodents is associated with a marked decline in glucose stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells (B cells). Secreted insulin is the end result of a series of steps along the biosynthetic protein-secretion pathway, including insulin gene transcription, processing of transcripts to preproinsulin mRNA, translation of mRNA, segregation and processing of newly made proinsulin in secretory vesicles, proinsulin to insulin conversion, transport of vesicles to the plasma membrane, and exocytosis. We have examined the influence of age at three stages along this pathway: preproinsulin mRNA levels, proinsulin synthesis, and secretion of newly made and preformed insulin, using Fischer rats, a widely studied rodent model of aging. Pancreatic weights and total insulin contents, islet sizes, and mean insulin content per islet were the same in young adult (4-5 mo) and senescent (21-22 mo) animals. There was no effect of age on preproinsulin mRNA levels in whole pancreata of fed animals, or in isolated islets cultured for 16 h in 5.5 mM glucose. Proinsulin biosynthesis and the secretion of newly made insulin were compared in isolated islets preincubated in 5.5 mM glucose. After a pulse label at 16.7 mM glucose, proinsulin synthesis, assayed by immunoprecipitation, was decreased 16% in 7 mo islets and 39% in 21-22 mo islets, compared with 4-5 mo islets, though total protein synthesis was not reduced. When chased at 2.8 mM glucose, 4-5 month and 21-22 mo islets showed no difference in release of preformed or newly made insulin. When chased at 16.7 mM glucose, there was a significant decrease in the secretion of newly made insulin in the old islets compared with the young islets. There was preferential release of newly made insulin over preformed insulin in both young and old islets. However, since secretion of preformed insulin was decreased much more than secretion of newly made insulin in senescent islets, these displayed a two- to threefold increase in the proportion of newly made insulin relative to total immunoreactive insulin released compared with young adult islets. The differential effects of aging on these steps in the insulin synthesis-secretion pathway may be due to varying impairments in signals transducing the glucose stimulus into the wide range of B cell responses to glucose.\r"

Changes from baseline during 3 h after the meal included an elevation of plasma osmolality, progressive urinary concentration, and increasingly positive fluid balance. Plasma renin activity and arginine vasopressin levels (measured in group II only) increased significantly. Nevertheless, the rate of peak postmeal renal plasma flow became elevated by 13 and 33% in groups I and II, respectively. Corresponding peak increases in postmeal glomerular filtration rate exceeded baseline by 10 and 16%. In the proteinuric subjects of group II the fractional clearances of albumin, IgG and uncharged dextrans in the radius interval 36-54 A, declined significantly after the meal. A similar depression of the fractional dextran-clearance profile was observed also in group I. Applying the fractional clearances of relatively permeant dextrans (radii less than or equal to 44 A) to a model of hindered solute transport through an isoporous membrane, we estimate that transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference increased by 12% in group I and by between 0 to 12% in group II after protein ingestion. We conclude (i) that oral protein ingestion increases glomerular ultrafiltration pressure and rate in both normal and diseased glomeruli, (ii) that this hemodynamic response may be mediated in part by the glomerulopressor hormones angiotensin II and arginine vasopressin, and (iii) that the foregoing hemodynamic changes exert no acute adverse effect on glomerular barrier size-selectivity.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated differential mechanism for differentiation of human peripheral blood resting B cells to Ig-secreting cells. Purified resting B cells were further fractionated into subsets by discontinuous density gradients of Percoll, and proliferation and differentiation responses to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) and/or T cell-derived soluble factors were studied. High density resting B cells were stimulated to proliferate vigorously in response to SAC, but were poorly differentiated by SAC in presence of T cell factors. In contrast, low density resting B cells failed to proliferate in response to SAC and/or T cell factors; these cells could, however, be induced by stimulation with SAC plus T cell factors to become cells actively secreting Ig. These results indicate that there may exist heterogeneity in the human resting B cells: one subset of resting B cells (B cells with low density) can differentiate directly into Ig-secreting cells without the need for proliferation, and another subset (B cells with high density) can proliferate actively without subsequent differentiation into Ig-secreting cells. To address whether these resting B cell subsets belong to the same lineage, only high density B cells recovered from circulating resting B cells were first stimulated for 7 d with SAC, refractionated on Percoll gradients, and differentiation response of the refractionated B cells to SAC and T cell factors was examined. B cells shifting toward low density fraction were located in the resting status and could differentiate in response to SAC plus T cell factors. These results indicate that some of B cells with high density belong to the same cell lineage as those with low density and they must first proliferate before differentiation.\r"

The clinical findings, laboratory investigations, treatment and outcome of 20 patients (Group 1) less than 2 years of age at presentation and 12 patients (Group 2) greater than 2 years of age at onset were compared. Of 20 Group 1 patients, 5 (25%) died. Available autopsies (four patients) showed endocardial fibroelastosis. Of 15 survivors, 10 showed improvement in cardiac status and 5 remained unchanged. Ninety-three percent of survivors had dilated cardiomyopathy consistent with endocardial fibroelastosis by angiocardiography. All 12 Group 2 patients died. In addition to age at presentation and poor outcome, Group 2 differed from Group 1 in having a higher incidence of other family members with cardiomyopathy, more significant rhythm disturbances at presentation and a more rapid course to death. Risk factors of poor outcome in both groups included persistent cardiomegaly and the development of significant arrhythmias by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring. Cardiac transplantation is recommended for children with dilated cardiomyopathy presenting after age 2 years who survive 1 month. Those patients less than 2 years old at presentation whose condition has not improved after 1 year and who have persistent cardiomegaly or complex ventricular arrhythmias may also benefit from transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "88088372\r", 
  ".W": "Densitometric regional ejection fraction obtained by computer analysis of digital subtraction ventriculography was evaluated as a new, quantitative, three-dimensional index of regional left ventricular performance. Eighteen patients with coronary artery disease and seven control subjects had right anterior oblique ventriculography at rest and immediately after rapid atrial pacing using central venous injection of contrast material. Regional left ventricular ejection fraction was determined by densitometry in six segments drawn around the end-diastolic center of gravity, and compared with two conventional indexes of segmental wall motion: area and radial regional ejection fraction. Densitometric, area or radial regional ejection fraction was classified as abnormal if it fell at least 2 standard deviations below the corresponding mean value in the normal group. The densitometric method did not require outlining of the end-systolic left ventricular silhouette and was the easiest and fastest to perform of all three techniques. In addition, intra- and interobserver reproducibilities were higher with the densitometric method (r = 0.97 and 0.95) than with either the area (r = 0.84 and 0.82) or the radial method (r = 0.82 and 0.76). Regional left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by the densitometric, area and radial techniques allowed the detection of coronary artery disease in 50, 50 and 44% of the patients at rest and in 83, 67 and 61% of the patients in the post-pacing period, respectively. Post-pacing regional left ventricular dysfunction accurately predicted the presence or absence of greater than 70% diameter stenosis in the supplying coronary artery in 75, 67 and 56% of the cases, respectively. Thus, densitometric analysis of digital subtraction ventriculography allows a fast and reproducible three-dimensional determination of regional left ventricular ejection fraction. Using this technique, pacing-induced regional dysfunction can be detected in most patients with coronary artery disease and corresponds well with the location of significant coronary artery lesions.\r"

The output is categorized by computer into graphic clinical scales which correlate and weigh information relating to seven of the most common causes of dementia. The present investigation assesses the validity of predictive diagnostic classifications derived from the clinical scales tested on admission by correlating them later with final diagnoses determined independently by thorough clinical evaluation including standard diagnostic tests, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance scans. Results of 101 healthy, neurologically normal, age-matched volunteers and 140 patients representative of the more common forms of dementia indicate that correct diagnostic identification was: 75% for dementia secondary to Parkinson's disease, 100% for Huntington's disease, 90.2% for Alzheimer's disease, 82.4% for multi-infarct dementia, 90.0% for posttraumatic dementia, 77.8% for normal-pressure hydrocephalus and 85.7% for Wernicke-Korsakoff dementia. Correct diagnostic assignment was highly significant (P less than .0005). The screening questionnaire may prove to be a useful and standard diagnostic tool for clinicians and investigators concerned with epidemiology, prevention and treatment of dementia.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are molecularly distinct cytokines acting on separate receptors. The release of these cytokines can be concomitantly induced by the same signal and from the same cellular source, suggesting that they may cooperate. Administered alone, human recombinant (hr)IL-1 alpha and hrTNF alpha protect lethally irradiated mice from death, whereas murine recombinant GM-CSF and hrG-CSF do not confer similar protection. On a dose basis, IL-1 alpha is a more efficient radioprotector than TNF alpha. At optimal doses, IL-1 alpha is a more radioprotective cytokine than TNF alpha in C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 mice and less effective than TNF alpha in C3H/HeN mice, suggesting that the relative effectiveness of TNF alpha and IL-1 alpha depends on the genetic makeup of the host. Administration of the two cytokines in combination results in additive radioprotection in all three strains. This suggests that the two cytokines act through different radioprotective pathways and argues against their apparent redundancy. Suboptimal, nonradioprotective doses of IL-1 alpha also synergize with GM-CSF or G-CSF to confer optimal radioprotection, suggesting that such an interaction may be necessary for radioprotection of hemopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

  ".U": "88088792\r", 
  ".W": "The effect was investigated of combinations of cytokines known to be cytostatic for some tumor cells, namely interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interferon-beta (IFN-beta), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), on the growth and differentiation of the mouse myeloid leukemic cell line, M1, cells. IL-1 alpha, IFN-beta, and TNF by themselves are antiproliferative for M1 cells. Treatment of cells with a mixture of any two of the three cytokines resulted in at least additive growth inhibition. None of these cytokines by themselves induced differentiation of M1 cells as assessed by increased expression of Fc receptors (FcR), stimulation of phagocytic activity and by morphologic criteria. However, as little as 1 U/ml IL-1 alpha in conjunction with IFN-beta or TNF increased FcR expression, phagocytic activity and morphologic changes in addition to inhibiting the growth of M1 cells. The combination of IFN-beta and TNF did not induce differentiation, although the growth of the cells was markedly inhibited. Both TNF and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the in vitro production of IFN activity by M1 cells. Furthermore, the induction of differentiation of M1 cells by a combination of IL-1 alpha with either IFN-beta, TNF, or LPS was inhibited by antibody against mouse IFN-beta. Therefore, it appears that IFN-beta provides one of the two required signals for differentiation of M1 cells by these combinations of stimulants, the other being IL-1. Furthermore, the cytostatic effect of TNF by itself on M1 cells was also partly blocked by anti-IFN-beta antibody, suggesting that IFN-beta is also involved in the growth inhibitory effect of TNF for M1 cells. In contrast, the cytostatic effect of IL-1 on M1 cells was not blocked by anti-IFN-beta antibody. In conclusion, both the cytostatic and differentiative effect of TNF appear to be mediated by IFN-beta. Thus, the combination of IL-1 and IFN-beta or inducers of IFN-beta resulted in terminal differentiation of M1 cells. Northern blot analysis using cDNAs for murine IFN-beta1 or human IFN-beta2 showed an increased expression of mRNA for IFN-beta1 but not for IFN-beta2 by stimulation with TNF or LPS, strongly suggesting that IFN-beta 1 rather than IFN-beta 2 is responsible for TNF or LPS effects.\r"

  ".U": "88088808\r", 
  ".W": "A murine model system was developed to determine whether ionizing radiation has a detrimental influence on thymic epithelium, cell function. Normal mice were lethally irradiated, grafted intracamerally with normal fetal thymic epithelium, and then reconstituted with fetal liver cells. These animals were compared with a group of animals who received their thymic grafts before the irradiation protocol. Analysis of the reconstitution of T cell function in peripheral lymph nodes and spleens at various times post transplantation demonstrated that animals with radiation-spared thymic grafts had superior proliferative responses to T cell mitogens and alloantigens. It was also determined that the capacity of these animals to elicit contact hypersensitivity responses was significantly greater when compared with animals whose thymic grafts had been radiated. The observed difference in T cell function could not be ascribed to a difference in the rate of export of mature T cells from the thymic grafts since the absolute number of Thy-1+, L3T4+, or Lyt-2+ lymphocytes present in the peripheral lymphoid compartment of our two groups of animals was equivalent. Immunohistologic analysis of the thymic grafts demonstrated a marked reduction in the medullary compartment of the repopulated grafts that had been exposed to ionizing radiation. The results of this study suggest: 1) that irradiation of the thymic microenvironment during marrow ablative preparative regimens may be in part responsible for some of the immune alterations observed in marrow transplant recipients, and 2) that our model system may provide a valuable tool for delineating the roles played by medullary and cortical epithelial cells of the thymus on the T cell maturation and education processes.\r"

The reaction of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-extracted proteins of whole S. mutans, serotype b), and S. rattus with the mAb revealed that the shared cross-reactive antigens were near m.w. 62,000 to 67,000. Several higher m.w. proteins in S. mutans Ingbritt 175 reacted with the mAb but were not observed in the other two strains of streptococci. Cytoplasmic membranes of S. rattus BHT reacted with these mAb in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The most reactive BHT membrane component detected by these mAb was a 62-kDa polypeptide that was similar in m.w. to the membrane component recognized by these antibodies in purified S. pyogenes membranes. The reactivity of the mAb with BHT membranes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was absorbed by rabbit skeletal muscle myosin.

  ".W": "The paper describes the induction by a monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibody (anti-Id mAb) of specific antibody production to group A streptococcal carbohydrate (A-CHO) in purified human B cells of several unrelated individuals. The anti-Id mAb, designated 16F498 (anti-Id498), recognizes a recurrent idiotope (Id 498) associated with the combining site of human antibodies to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), the immunodominant group of A-CHO. Id498 is expressed on IgM anti-GlcNAc antibodies but does not occur on IgG antibodies with the same specificity. It occurs also on a minor population of IgM antibodies without specificity for A-CHO. Id498 was found in 19 of 27 sera from unselected healthy donors and thus seems to be frequently expressed within the adult B cell repertoire. The in vitro induction of anti-A-CHO antibodies was analyzed in human B cells extensively depleted for T cells. Specific antibody secretion required cross-linked anti-Id which was achieved by coupling the mAb to agarose beads. No antibody secretion could be induced by soluble anti-Id (1 and 10 micrograms/ml). An optimal response required soluble T cell-derived factors which were added as a mixture of recombinant interleukin 2 with a T cell hybridoma supernatant that augments B cell growth and differentiation. Under these conditions an antigen-independent specific increase of IgM anti-A-CHO production (2.6- to 10-fold, or up to 2000 ng/ml respectively) could be induced in blood B cell populations of four of six normal individuals expressing the Id498 at serum level.\r"

  ".W": "A cloned complementary DNA, termed pS2, was isolated from a human fibroblast cDNA library in the bacteriophage expression vector lambda gt11 after screening with a patient's serum containing a high titer of anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies. A reasonable amount of cro-beta-galactosidase fusion protein (pS2EX) was obtained through subcloning of the pS2 insert into a plasmid expression vector pEX-2. Antibody against pS2EX (anti-pS2EX) was purified from this patient's serum by Sepharose 4B conjugated with pS2EX. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells with anti-pS2EX antibody exhibited a typical speckled pattern in the interphase nuclei. In the immunoblot analysis, the anti-pS2EX antibody recognized the 22 kDa protein. Using immunoprecipitation of cell lysate and subsequent RNA analysis, anti-pS2EX antibody was shown to precipitate U1 RNP only. The reactivities of various anti-RNP sera to pS2EX correlated well with the positive reaction to C polypeptide in the immunoblot. These findings indicate that pS2 is a cDNA for C polypeptide of U1 snRNP. In the Northern blot using human RNA and radiolabeled pS2, a single band about 800 base was observed. The nucleotide sequence of pS2 showed no significant homologies to known proteins.\r"

F78 selectively immunoprecipitated a unique pattern of small nuclear RNA (U1, U2, and U4 to U6) characterized by a marked depletion of U1 and an elevated proportion of U2 compared with known patterns immunoprecipitated by previously described anti-RNP (2.73) and anti-Sm (7.13, Y12) mAb. Analysis of immunoprecipitated RNA from extracts previously cleared with mAb F78 and probed with anti-RNP mAb 2.73 further indicated the presence of two distinct subsets of U1. Immunoblots of whole cell extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) without heating showed that F78 selectively bound to a trypsin-sensitive component of apparent m.w. greater than 120,000 which was decreased in size following RNase A treatment. The anti-Sm mAb, but not the anti-RNP mAb, also recognized this component in unheated samples. Heating before SDS-PAGE resulted in abrogation of binding to the F78 epitope. Immunoprecipitation of unlabeled or [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts with F78 revealed the presence of most snRNP peptides, but the absence of peptide C and the 68,000 m.w. component, known to be selectively associated with U1-specific snRNP. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of F78 immunoprecipitates confirmed that the epitope recognized by this mAb resides on a heat-dissociable complex containing snRNP-related peptides B, B', D, E, F, and G, but lacking U1-associated peptides. F78 mAb therefore defines a subset of snRNP which lack anti-RNP associated U1 RNA as well as peptides known to be selectively associated with this RNA species. It apparently recognizes an epitope associated with an assembled form of these particles and may be useful in examining structures involved in RNA processing.\r"

For this purpose, cells from an antigen-specific T helper cell line were treated with cyclosporin A (CSA). The stimulation of CSA-treated T cells with specific antigen in the presence of low concentrations of CSA, demonstrated that the T cells did not release detectable levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and interleukin-5. When such CSA-treated T cells interacted with hapten-specific B cells in the presence of specific antigen, the B cells were found to develop responsiveness to exogenously added growth and differentiation inducing soluble mediators. The development of lymphokine responsiveness in such cultures could be partially blocked by the addition of a monoclonal antibody specific for major histocompatibility complex class II molecules expressed on the B cell surfaces. These results indicated that antigen-mediated interaction between B and T cells, in the absence of lymphokines, resulted in a phenotypic change in B cell behavior and suggested that the signal that promoted this change occurred as a consequence of the T cell antigen receptor binding to B cell surface Ia in association with processed antigen. This experimental system should afford an opportunity to determine the biochemical and molecular consequences in B cells that have interacted, by direct cell contact, with helper T cells.\r"

The first cells to repopulate the thymus on day 7 after bone marrow transplantation were intrathymic radioresistant T cell precursors, which expanded mainly to CD4+CD8+ host-type thymocytes by day 14. A high level of gamma gene expression but a much reduced level of alpha and beta gene expression were detected in the host-type thymocytes on day 7. During regeneration of these cells, gamma-chain messages fell to low level and alpha and beta mRNA levels increased. The thymus of the recipients began to be repopulated by donor-derived T cells about 2 wk after bone marrow transplantation and was almost completely replaced by the third week. An ordered expression of gamma then beta and alpha-chain gene transcript was also observed in the donor-type thymocytes at the early stage after bone marrow transplantation. The use of thymocytes at early stage in whole-body irradiated bone marrow chimera provides a pertinent source for investigating the molecular mechanism of T cell differentiation in adult thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant clones expressing antigenic determinants of the 18-kDa protein antigen from Mycobacterium leprae recognized by the L5 monoclonal antibody were isolated from a lambda gt11 expression library and their nucleotide sequences determined. All clones expressed the M. leprae-specific determinant as part of a large fusion protein with Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of the coding region indicated that all the lambda gt11 recombinant clones contained an incomplete M. leprae gene sequence representing the carboxy-terminal two-thirds (111 amino acids) of the 18-kDa gene and coding for a peptide of m.w. 12,432. Subsequent isolation and sequencing of a 3.2kb BamHI-PstI DNA fragment from a genomic M. leprae cosmid library permitted the deduction of the complete 148 amino acid sequence with a predicted m.w. of 16,607. A second open reading frame 560 bases downstream from the 18-kDa coding sequence was found to code for a putative protein of 137 amino acids (m.w. = 15,196). Neither this nor the 18-kDa amino acid sequence displayed any significant homologies with any proteins in the GENBANK, EMBL, or NBRF data bases. Crude lysates from recombinant lambda gt11 clones expressing part of the 18-kDa protein have been reported to stimulate the proliferation of some M. leprae-specific helper T cell clones. Thus, it is significant that the complete 18-kDa sequence contains five short peptides predicted to be possible helper T cell antigenic epitopes based on their propensity to form amphipathic helices. Although three of these occur within the 111 amino acid carboxy-terminal peptide expressed by lambda gt11 clones, the most highly amphipathic peptide is found in the amino-terminal region not present in the lambda gt11 recombinants.\r"

Two of the volunteers had no previously known exposure to TT. Eight volunteers made detectable antipeptide, anticircumsporozoite protein or antisporozoite antibodies, whose titers increased after multiple injections in four individuals. The maximum antisporozoite titer obtained in an immunofluorescence assay was 1280. In those individuals who produced antipeptide antibody, the overall correlation between IgG anti-Ac-Cys-(NANP)3 antibody in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IgG antisporozoite reactivity in immunofluorescence was highly significant. However, the fine specificity of antibody varied among volunteers with two individuals producing mostly antipeptide antibody. Anti-TT antibody responses increased in all volunteers with the exception of that person who had the highest pretrial anti-TT titer; this individual was one of the two pre-TT-immunized volunteers who failed to produce anti-Ac-Cys-(NANP)3 or sporozoite antibody. For the two non-TT preimmunized volunteers, one produced an antisporozoite fluorescence titer of 320; the other made no detectable antibody against either Ac-Cys-(NANP)3 or sporozoites during a primary response. For the three volunteers monitored, after the first injection, significant T cell proliferative responses to (NANP)3 were observed, which increased up to 4 wk after immunization, when a second injection was given. Responsiveness then declined to background levels and did not reappear after further immunizations. In contrast, a marked TT-specific proliferation was observed for the duration of the study.\r"

  ".W": "Reticulum cell sarcomas (RCS) of SJL mice are completely dependent on host cells for their growth and therefore fail to grow in vitro. RCS cells induce marked proliferation in SJL Ly-1+2- T cells accompanied by lymphokine production. In an attempt to fully understand the host-tumor cell interaction, an RCS cell line, cRCS-X, was established in vitro from a transplantable tumor by the addition, every 3 wk, of gamma-irradiated syngeneic lymph node (LN) cells to the culture. cRCS-X maintains all of the characteristics of the parent tumor, RCS-X, including cell surface phenotype (Ks and I-As positive, Ds negative and B cell marker 14.8 positive), ability to stimulate host T cells, and ability to grow in nonirradiated but not in gamma-irradiated SJL mice. The growth factor requirements of cRCS-X were examined. It was found that human BCGF can replace gamma-irradiated LN cells in the maintenance of long term in vitro growth of cRCS-X. cRCS-X cells respond to human B cell growth factor (BCGF) or to recombinant murine interleukin (IL)-5 in a short term proliferation assay [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) in a dose-dependent manner in the presence and absence of fetal calf serum. BCGF also promotes colony formation in soft agar by cRCS-X cells. Although both IL-1 and interferon-gamma can synergize with BCGF in the induction of cRCS-X proliferation, these lymphokines, as well as IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-4 have no effect on cRCS-X growth when added alone. In addition, it was shown that SJL LN cells produce both IL-4 and BCGF II activities as assayed on murine B cells, after stimulation with gamma-irradiated cRCS-X cells. In light of these results it is postulated that IL-5, [corrected] produced by syngeneic T cells [corrected] after stimulation with RCS, is essential for RCS growth, both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that crude preparations containing murine interleukin-1 (IL-1) or a human epithelial cell-derived IL-1 inhibitor (ILS) modulate CD1 expression by LC in organ culture. This study examined the effect of organ-culture derived human IL-1, recombinant human IL-1, and purified ILS on CD1 expression in dispersed epithelial cell cultures. Both IL-1 preparations stimulated CD1 expression in whole and CD1-depleted cultures. The optimal dose level for this effect was 0.5 U/ml. Higher dose levels did not result in an increase in CD1 expression, implying that a limited pool of CD1 negative EC are induced to express CD1 by IL-1. Induction of CD1 expression on whole and depleted EC was abrogated by ILS. These results indicate that human IL-1 and an IL-1 inhibitor act in combination to modulate CD1 expression on Langerhans cells in the gingival epithelium.\r"

These cells were obtained using a sterile microdissection technique. Plucked anagen follicles were dissected free of surrounding tissues (inner and outer root sheaths), and presumptive hair shaft cells (including germinal epithelia) were cultured directly on mammalian fibroblasts or in media preconditioned by fibroblasts. Specimens were cultured either as dispersions or in whole tissue pieces. Trypsinized whole tissue specimens in culture were sometimes observed to form increased bulk, while dispersed cells appeared to elongate and form larger colonies. In sections of these colonies examined by transmission electron microscopy, intracellular hard keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) together with IF-matrix hard keratin complexes were observed. Radiolabelled cysteine [35S] was added to cultures (3-20 days), showing a continuing but reduced synthesis of hard keratin IF proteins (low-sulfur) over the period of study. Matrix protein (high-sulfur) production was drastically reduced after 3 days. Monoclonal antibodies directed against hair keratin IF components were used in Western transfers and immunofluorescent studies to help assess the specificity of proteins synthesized in culture. Our observations indicate that, with some refinement, the presently described methods enable preparation of hair shaft precursor cells suitable for observing certain hair-forming processes in vitro.\r"

A total of 844 samples repeatably reactive by an ELISA screening test were negative both by western blot and by the CIA; 48 samples positive by ELISA, but negative or indeterminate by western blot, were positive by the CIA.

Sera from all four patients with active pinta contained antibody to the 47-48 kilodalton major antigen; the intensity of reactivity and the number of antigens recognized increased with age and, presumably, duration of infection. Sera from six children with inactive pinta reacted strongly with multiple T. pallidum antigens, whereas adults with inactive pinta had less intense reactivity against fewer molecules. Seronegative controls demonstrated only weak reactivity to fewer than five molecules. The development of antibody reactivity to the full spectrum of T. pallidum antigens during the course of infection demonstrates the high degree of antigenic relatedness of T. pallidum and Treponema carateum and is similar to the development of humoral responsiveness during syphilis infection.\r"

In this study, we show that surface receptors for the C3 fragment iC3b are present on the yeast Candida albicans, where they promote the pathogenicity of this organism by inhibiting phagocytosis. These receptors share homology with the alpha-chain, but not with the beta-chain, of neutrophil receptors for iC3b, as determined by the binding of monoclonal antibodies, and are induced by mycelial transformation of the yeast and by high concentrations of glucose. Blockade of these receptors by monoclonal antibodies significantly augments phagocytosis for those strains studied. By binding iC3b noncovalently, these receptors impair phagocytic uptake of C. albicans by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\r"

J5 antisera, however, reduced lethality from J5 core glycolipid. In contrast, O-specific rabbit antisera were consistently protective against the lethal activity of wild-type, smooth enterobacterial endotoxins, but such protection was limited to the homologous endotoxin.

The protective strains produced high levels of flagellin.

After aerosol exposure, the lung clearance rate of each organism varied inversely with the age of the animals, and the magnitude of the clearance defect was related more strongly to animal age than to the bacterial species. Fewer alveolar macrophages from infant animals phagocytosed each type of organism in vivo, and the rate of neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of infant animals was delayed. The neonatal lung functioned effectively, however, as an antibacterial barrier, as newborn animals survived an aerosolized inoculum that exceeded the LD50 by the subcutaneous route.\r"

The chromosomal DNA of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas cepacia, and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae was digested with EcoRI. Agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, and hybridization by 32P-labeled rRNA revealed eight to 13 bands. The P. cepacia and H. influenzae banding patterns, observed by using an E. coli rRNA probe, were identical to those produced with homologous rRNA probes. Polymorphism of several hybridization bands distinguished all E. coli isolates, nine of 10 H. influenzae isolates, and seven of eight P. cepacia isolates. Two to four bands were common to all P. cepacia and E. coli isolates. The banding patterns of H. influenzae isolates cultured from the trachea and blood of an infant and from the mother's cervix were identical. These data demonstrate that this method is a widely applicable system for determining the molecular epidemiology of genetically diverse gram-negative organisms.\r"

This study describes a chemoattractant for PMNLs that is elaborated by human embryonic lung fibroblast cells infected with rhinovirus. Chemotaxis assays were done in a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber with normal adult PMNLs. Medium supernatants from rhinovirus-infected cell culture attracted 87 +/- 6 (mean +/- SE) PMNLs/10 high-power fields (x450) compared with 38 +/- 6 PMNLs/10 high-power fields attracted by medium from uninfected cell cultures (P less than .0001). Elaboration of the chemoattractant was not a result of cell destruction and did not require the presence of infectious virus. This chemoattractant produced by human fibroblast cells may contribute to the influx of PMNLs into the nasal mucosa during rhinovirus infection. The PMNLs may, in turn, have a role in producing symptoms of the common cold.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that heparin lowers blood pressure significantly in hypertensive rats. This study was initiated to examine whether prostaglandin (PG) mediates the antihypertensive action of heparin. To this end, the effect of three different PG synthesis inhibitors (indomethacin, aspirin, meclofenamate) on the cardiovascular and renal actions of heparin was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). During 4 weeks of treatment, heparin reduced blood pressure significantly (P less than 0.01) in SHR. This was accompanied by significant decrements in hematocrit and total peripheral resistance but a significant increment in cardiac output. All of the PG inhibitors used significantly potentiated the antihypertensive effect of heparin and further reduced blood pressure by about 20%. Although heparin alone increased plasma renin activity, heparin and PG inhibitors together prevented this effect. When compared with heparin-treated rats, SHR treated with heparin and PG inhibitors combined had significantly (p less than 0.05 to 0.01) lower plasma aldosterone levels. These levels, however, were not different from SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone. Like blood pressures, the renal histopathologic lesions in SHR treated with heparin or heparin and PG inhibitors combined were significantly less severe than those in untreated SHR or SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone. Finally, captopril was shown to potentiate the effect of heparin. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of heparin does not appear to be PG mediated, but may be related to the structural changes in renal arterioles, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, or both.\r"

  ".W": "A murine hybridoma monoclonal line-secreted antibody (C3G5) against the light chain of human high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), which consisted of gamma-1 kappa isotype, was largely composed of 190 kd molecules, and gave an optimal reaction when used in an equimolar concentration with HMWK. It did not influence the initial digestion of HMWK or the amount of kinin released by kallikrein. Pretreatment of HMWK with C3G5 antibodies did not augment or inhibit its coagulant properties, nor did pretreatment interfere with its adsorption on kaolin or on the ion-exchange resin diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sephadex A-50. The epitope that reacted with this antibody was localized to a portion of the light chain within 6 kd of the carboxy-terminus of the molecule near the single cysteine of this chain, at residue 614. This monoclonal antibody reacted with an epitope that was stable during early plasmin digestion. The amounts of antigens reactive with a polyclonal antibody to the light chain were increased during the same period of plasmin digestion. Prolonged plasmin digestion reduced the amounts of both types of light chain antigens. During kallikrein digestion, the amount of epitope reactive with C3G5 antibody was unaffected, whereas the concentration of antigens detected with polyclonal anti-light chain antibodies was increased throughout digestion. Therefore, light chain antigens reactive with the polyclonal antibody are probably in the interior of the uncleaved molecule and become exposed after initial cleavage, which probably facilitates changes in the conformation of the molecule. The epitope reactive with monoclonal antibodies is probably on the surface of the uncleaved molecule.\r"

We used linear discriminant analysis to determine a classification rule capable of diagnosing new cases of chronic and recurrent primary headache in children. We considered 23 symptoms in 118 patients. Through discriminant analysis we chose five variables: frequency of the attacks, type of pain, neurologic deficits, nausea, and vomiting. With this classification rule, we obtained a total correct classification of 84.7% for migraine, psychogenic headache, and non-defined headache in respect to the diagnoses formulated by a pediatrician and a child neuropsychiatrist after 3 months of follow-up. Our method for diagnosing migraine has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. The algorithm, validated on another 105 pediatric patients, produced a total correct result of 82.9%.\r"

(2) Subjects individually excluded behaviors irrelevant to them, thus allowing the score to better reflect injury-related changes. (3) The different areas of functioning on the Sickness Impact Profile were reweighted to reflect global judgments of the construct's contribution to overall functioning rather than the sum of the item contributions. Only the first modification is head-injury specific. The others, are relevant to any disease or injury. The performance of the modifications was evaluated in a longitudinal study of 102 head injured and 102 comparison subjects tested at 1 and 12 months after injury. The evaluation of the modifications was based on their ability to distinguish head injury from comparison subjects and on the strength of their relationship with measures of brain dysfunction. Despite a few statistically significant improvements in discrimination, differences of a practical degree were not obtained. The standard Sickness Impact Profile performed well and is recommended for evaluation of day-to-day functioning in head injury studies.\r"

As comorbidity changed from none to medium, 60% of those scenarios that were originally rated as appropriate for endoscopy and cholecystectomy remained appropriate. As high comorbidity was introduced, only 13% of such scenarios remained appropriate for endoscopy, while 33% remained appropriate for cholecystectomy. These findings suggest that, although clinical reasons for performing procedures are a powerful determinant of when they should be used, comorbidity is also important and needs to be included in any assessment of the appropriateness of procedure use.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred sixty-three patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) were treated from 1981 to 1983 with VEPA (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and doxorubicin) or VEPA-M (VEPA plus methotrexate) in randomized fashion after stratification by surface marker. The complete response (CR) rate and the 4-year survival rate of patients treated with VEPA-M was 62.2% and 36.9%, respectively, while for those treated with VEPA the rates were 51.9% and 26.6, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant, but pretreatment characteristics predictive for response and survival were interesting. Three factors, leukemic change, poor performance status (PS), and T cell marker, were negatively associated with both CR and survival rates, and high-grade pathology was adversely associated with survival rate in a multivariate analysis. These prognostic factors are somewhat different from those in Western lymphomas. This may be reflection of major differences in patients' characteristics between Japanese and Western lymphomas: in this study, there was a high incidence of T cell lymphoma/leukemia (50%) including ATL (33%), leukemic manifestation (34%), poor PS (34%), and a low incidence of follicular lymphoma (9%). The statistically significant three factors for both CR and survival rates were used to construct a model containing eight categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival. These categories were divided into four groups, with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 91% and 73%, 67% and 35%, 27% and 7%, and 10% and 5%. Ninety-three patients in whom CR was induced by VEPA or VEPA-M therapy were evaluated for prognostic factors predictive for disease-free survival. A shorter period (less than 28 days) required to achieve CR, a clinical diagnosis of ATL, and a lower hemoglobin level were found to affect disease-free survival adversely. These results have important implications for both the design of prospective randomized therapeutic trials and the determination of optimal therapy for individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "Elective lymph node dissection (ELND) for patients with clinically occult metastatic melanoma in regional lymph nodes has the goal of curing metastases with a surgical treatment. This is in contrast to the low probability for surgical cure in patients with clinically detectable lymph node metastases. The rationale for elective node dissection is based on a hypothesis that melanoma metastasizes sequentially via lymph nodes and then to distant sites. A subgroup of melanoma patients with high risk for regional node micrometastases but low risk for distant micrometastases has been identified from prognostic factors analysis of large patient series, as well as surgical results of nonrandomized clinical trials. However, two nonrandomized surgical trials have failed to show a survival benefit for ELND. These studies were largely performed in female patients with extremity melanomas and there were limitations that preclude a definitive conclusion. No randomized trials have been conducted involving melanomas of the trunk or head and neck. Two prospective randomized surgical trials are now being conducted in North America and in Europe. Until the results of these trials are available, physicians are encouraged to enter patients into these ongoing clinical trials or consider ELND in selected patients where the benefit-risk ratio justifies it. Factors to be considered in this decision include intermediate tumor thickness (ie, 1 to 4 mm thickness), anatomic site, histology (ulceration and growth pattern), and the risk of the operation in individual patient settings.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1980 and September 1985, 35 adult patients with resectable retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas were entered on a randomized trial comparing two forms of adjuvant radiation therapy. Fifteen patients received the experimental therapy consisting of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to 20 Gy using high-energy electrons followed by low-dose (35 to 40 Gy) postoperative external beam irradiation. Twenty patients received standard therapy consisting of high-dose (50 to 55 Gy) postoperative external beam irradiation. With a minimum follow-up of 15 months, there is no significant difference in the actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) comparing the two groups (median DFS, 34 months; median OS, 38 months). At 5 years follow-up, approximately 40% of patients are alive and 20% of patients remain disease-free. Although there is a trend towards an improvement in in-field local control in the experimental arm, the predominant pattern of failure in both groups was locoregional within the retroperitoneum and/or peritoneal cavity. Acute and late radiation enteritis were significantly reduced in the experimental group. However, four experimental patients developed late (greater than 6 months following treatment) peripheral neuropathy believed related to the use of IORT; all four recovered. We conclude that there is no difference in the therapeutic effectiveness of the combination of IORT and low-dose external beam radiation compared with conventional high-dose radiation as adjuvant treatment in retroperitoneal sarcomas, although the former appears to be less toxic. Newer combined modality treatment strategies are discussed to improve the prognosis in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "From May 1979 to March 1983, 76 evaluable patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) were treated by members of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG). Forty-six children treated by the six-drug A-COP+ regimen (Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone) were compared in a prospective randomized trial with 30 patients receiving the modified ten-drug LSA2-L2 (cyclosphosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, Daunomycin [daunorubicin cerubidine; Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia], prednisone, cytarabine, thioguanine, asparaginase, hydroxyurea, and carmustine) regimen. After adjusting for stage (I and II v III v IV), there was no statistically significant difference (P = .19) between A-COP+ and LSA2-L2 regimens on the basis of 3-year survival and disease-free survival (62% v 72% and 53% v 58%, respectively for the two treatment regimens) but the power of analysis and thus the ability to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the outcome with the two regimens was limited by the small number of patients. Neither therapy was effective for most patients with stage IV disease, with failure occurring in six of seven children receiving A-COP+ regimen and eight of 11 patients receiving LSA2-L2. Although the LSA2-L2 regimen was more toxic during the induction of remission, the toxicity during maintenance was acceptable and similar for both treatments. CNS relapse was not a significant problem whether cranial radiation with intrathecal (IT) therapy (A-COP+) or IT therapy alone (LSA2-L2) were used. Our results confirm the overall effectiveness of the LSA2-L2 regimen in children with LBLs, especially those initially free of bone marrow or CNS involvement, but were inconclusive as to the inferiority or superiority of this regimen over the A-COP+ regimen.\r"

The regression rate (30%) was identical for both treatments. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences noted between treatments for regression duration (6.9 months v 7.6 months), time to progression (2.1 months v 4.4 months), or overall survival (5.5 months v 6.9 months). The lack of advantage for the theoretically superior alternating approach was probably due to a combination of relative ineffectiveness of each treatment and lack of complete non-cross resistance.\r"

Categories considered eligible were the four types of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (criteria of Horn and Enterline), extraosseous Ewing's tumor (EOE), and a group of somewhat variable undifferentiated sarcomas designated small round cell sarcoma, type indeterminate (STI). Tumors that were clearly sarcomas but were unclassifiable also were included (NOS). The committee diagnoses were embryonal (Emb) RMS in 877 (54%), alveolar (Alv) RMS in 343 (21%), botryoid (Botr) RMS in 88 (5%), pleomorphic (Pleo) RMS in 11 (1%), STI in 135 (8%), and EOE in 84 (5%). One in nine were mixtures of types, eg, Emb and Alv. Five percent of the sarcomas could not be classified because of inadequate material. In general, there was close agreement (94%) between the review committee and institutional pathologists in the diagnosis of RMS, but not in the specific types, particularly Alv RMS (41%) and STI (36%). This observation is important, since patients with Alv RMS and STI tumors had decreased survival compared with the other histologies. The prognosis varied by histology, with Botr having the best, Alv RMS and STI the worst, and Emb RMS and EOE an intermediate prognosis.\r"

Three hundred fifty-two (43%) had recurrent disease at a median follow-up time of 6 years. The 2-year survival percentages from time of first relapse were 16% for patients with initial metastases in visceral or multiple sites (including bone and soft tissue), 41% for those with regional metastases or skeletal relapse alone and 70% for patients with isolated local recurrence or contralateral breast cancer. The features that most influenced prognosis within the categories defined by site of first relapse were disease-free interval (less than 24 months v greater than or equal to 24 months), and estrogen receptor content in the primary tumor. These features had clinical importance (identifying patients with at least a 50% 2-year survival percentage) only in those patients with local, contralateral breast, regional, or bony disease alone. The treatment of individual patients after relapse must be directed toward optimized palliation. The results of this study are important for defining groups of patients who relapse after CMF for whom the subsequent therapeutic approach might be differentiated (eg, experimental treatments for dire prognosis, accent on minimal side effect treatment for intermediate prognosis, and investigation of adjuvant systemic therapy for isolated local recurrence).\r"

In the past 5 years there have been literally hundreds of trials of new agents, combinations of old and new agents, and even new routes and approaches to the delivery of chemotherapy. In this review, the literature has been studied and the individual reports analyzed to evaluate the impact of the new findings on clinical management of the patient with malignant glioma of the brain. The major areas of progress include the addition of new drugs with varying modes of action, the use of combinations of drugs in a synergistic fashion, and the development of new routes of drug delivery. None of the advances has brought about the revolution in clinical care that is so eagerly sought, but clearly the amount of new knowledge gained by these studies helps in understanding how to use chemotherapy more effectively. Furthermore, the remarkable degree of interest and involvement in the use of chemotherapy promises that an even greater number of patients with malignant gliomas will be considered for vigorous and enthusiastic clinical management programs even if chemotherapy itself is not the key modality in the treatment of a specific patient.\r"

All of these factors are important. The development of mathematical models led to the conclusion that these tumors, generally regarded histologically as low-grade astrocytomas, actually have a very wide but continuous range of growth rates. Some grow rapidly enough to be explained by simple exponential doubling at a constant rate, but most behave as though their growth decelerates. Decelerating growth rates make comparisons of various groups of patients difficult. No support is found for the classical hypothesis that some may be hamartomas. Inadequately treated gliomas of the optic nerve or chiasm bear about the same poor prognosis. However, tumors of the optic nerve (intracranial as well as intraorbital) have an excellent prognosis following complete surgical excision and only a slightly poorer prognosis following irradiation. About 5% of optic nerve gliomas recur in the chiasm following \"complete\" intraorbital excision. Patients with neurofibromatosis have about twice the recurrence rate following complete excision of an intraorbital glioma. Optic chiasmal gliomas appear to respond to irradiation with doses above 4500 rads. Patients with neurofibromatosis have about the same prognosis as patients without neurofibromatosis following irradiation of a chiasmal glioma.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional means of localizing sensorimotor cortex during surgery is Penfield's procedure of mapping sensory and motor responses elicited by electrical stimulation of the cortical surface. This procedure can accurately localize sensorimotor cortex but is time-consuming and best carried out in awake, cooperative patients. An alternative localization procedure is presented that involves cortical surface recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP's), providing accurate and rapid localization in patients under either local or general anesthesia. The morphology and amplitude of median nerve SEP's recorded from the cortical surface varied systematically as a function of spatial location relative to the sensorimotor hand representation area. These results were validated in 18 patients operated on under local anesthesia in whom the sensorimotor cortex was independently localized by electrical stimulation mapping; the two procedures were in agreement in all cases. Similar SEP results were demonstrated in an additional 27 patients operated on under general anesthesia without electrical stimulation mapping. The following three spatial relationships between SEP's and the anatomy of the sensorimotor cortex permit rapid and accurate localization of the sensorimotor hand area: 1) SEP's with approximately mirror-image waveforms are recorded at electrode sites in the hand area on opposite sides of the central sulcus (P20-N30 precentrally and N20-P30 postcentrally); 2) the P25-N35 is recorded from the postcentral gyrus as well as a small region of the precentral gyrus in the immediate vicinity of the central sulcus: this waveform is largest on the postcentral gyrus about 1 cm medial to the focus of the 20- and 30-msec potentials; and 3) regardless of component identification, maximum SEP amplitudes are recorded from the hand representation area on the precentral and postcentral gyri.\r"

The purified M-LMCr appeared to be an anionic organic Cr compound with a molecular weight of 1500, as determined by gel permeation chromatography. It contained aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine and cysteine in a ratio of 5:4:2:1 and no detectable carbohydrate. Although we were unable to detect nicotinic acid, some ultraviolet-absorbing (lambda max 260 nm) chemical structure was shown to be a constituent. Purified M-LMCr stimulated the rates of both [U-14C]glucose oxidation and [3-3H]glucose conversion into lipid in rat epididymal adipocytes at Cr concentrations greater than 1.5 ng/mL in relation to insulin action. This substance appears to have properties similar to those of glucose tolerance factor in yeast and the low-molecular-weight, chromium-binding substance present in mammalian liver. The role of M-LMCr in Cr nutrition and detoxication is discussed.\r"

Apnea was diagnosed exclusively by continuous recording of heart rate, respiratory impedance, end-tidal CO2, and either or both transcutaneous oxygen and pulse oximetry. Four discrete serum concentrations of theophylline (23 mumol/l or 4.2 mg/L, 47 mumol/L or 8.5 mg/L, 70 mumol/L or 12.7 mg/L, and 84 mumol/L or 15.3 mg/L) were attained by using repeated loading doses of 4 mg/kg and increasing the maintenance dose from 1 to 1.5 mg/kg to 2 to 2.5 mg/kg, given every 8 hours. Before treatment and 24 hours after each loading dose, airway occlusions and measures of tidal volume, minute ventilation, and respiratory timing were performed. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by either a continuous computer data-acquisition system or paper recording for the duration of the study. Of the 22 infants, three responded at level 1, three at level 2, and 10 at level 3. One of the four infants loaded to the fourth level had a sustained response for a total cumulative response of 77%. The five remaining infants required additional treatment with doxapram or continuous positive airway pressure. There was a significant increase in inspiratory pressure 100 msec after airway occlusion, maximum inspiratory pressure during airway occlusion, tidal volume, ratio of tidal volume to inspiratory time (mean inspiratory flow), and minute ventilation from the pretreatment measurements to those at the maximum dose of theophylline. The apnea response did not correlate with these improvements in ventilation measures.\r"

We studied the clinical, radiologic, and morphologic features of 17 cases previously diagnosed as achondrogenesis type I to define whether there is even further heterogeneity. On radiographic analysis, two distinct groups of patients were defined based on the presence or absence of rib fractures and ossification of the vertebral pedicles, ischium, and fibula. Two distinct chondroosseous morphologic patterns were observed that directly correlated with the radiographic grouping. One group had round vacuolated chondrocytes with inclusion bodies; the other had collagenous rings around the chondrocytes. We conclude that achondrogenesis type I (Parenti-Fraccaro) consists of two distinct disorders: type IA, which corresponds to the cases originally published by Houston et al. and Harris et al., and type IB, which corresponds to the case originally published by Fraccaro. Analysis of Parenti's case suggests the diagnosis of achondrogenesis type II. All three types of achondrogenesis appear to be inherited as autosomal recessive traits.\r"

  ".W": "The peptides substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) released from peptidergic neurons have potent effects on gland secretion and on smooth muscle tone. Because mast cells release proteases during degranulation, and are located in many of the same tissue microenvironments into which SP and VIP are released, we wished to examine whether mast cell proteases, by cleaving and thus inactivating these peptides, could modulate their effects. We used active site-titrated preparations of the two major neutral proteases of mast cell granules, tryptase and chymase, to determine the sites and rates of cleavage of SP and VIP. The proteases were purified from dog mastocytomas. Tryptase cleaved VIP rapidly at two sites with a kcat/Km of 2.2 X 10(5) sec-1 M-1, but had no effect on SP. Chymase cleaved both SP and VIP at primarily a single site with kcat/Km of 3.9 X 10(4) and 5.4 X 10(4) sec-1 M-1, respectively. Thus, these data show that mast cell proteases degrade SP and VIP. The differences in peptidase activity between tryptase and chymase suggest that the consequences of protease release could vary according to mast cell protease phenotype and location in various tissues and species. Tryptase, by cleaving the bronchodilator VIP but not the bronchoconstrictor SP, might promote bronchial hyper-responsiveness in asthma by decreasing the nonadrenergic neural inhibitory influence mediated by VIP. In skin and other tissues, chymase might interrupt axon reflex-mediated neurogenic inflammation by cleaving SP.\r"

Pial arterioles were observed directly using a closed cranial window in chloralose-anesthetized piglets. Topical application of 100, 300, 1000, 3000 and 10,000 ng/ml of KC-404 produced concentration-dependent increases in pial arteriolar diameter. Diameters were 168 +/- 18, 190 +/- 19 and 238 +/- 21 mu for control, 100 ng/ml and 10,000 ng/ml of KC-404, respectively. Responses to KC-404 (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo-[1,5a]-pyridine) were blocked by indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.). Moreover, KC-404, topically applied to the cerebral cortex, produced small but significant increases in cortical subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha and PGE2, whereas thromboxane B2 levels were unchanged. Similar to topical application, i.v. KC-404 (0.5 mg/kg) produced pial arteriolar dilation without significantly altering arterial blood pressure. Intravenous KC-404 also increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2, whereas thromboxane levels were unchanged. Further, topically applied KC-404 (1 microgram/ml) potentiated dilator responses to PGE2 and PGI2, whereas responses to isoproterenol were unchanged. These data indicate that KC-404 is a potent dilator of cerebral arterioles in newborn pigs. These data also suggest that KC-404 produces cerebral vasodilation predominantly by potentiating prostanoid-mediated dilation.\r"

In addition, we have studied its antihypertensive effect in the awake renal artery-ligated rat, whose elevated levels of plasma renin activity and sensitivity to captopril and saralasin define it as a renin-angiotensin system-dependent hypertensive model. Our results utilizing isolated rabbit aorta strips and pithed rats suggest that KAA8 is a specific AII functional antagonist because it selectively inhibited the AII response in these models without altering the effects of norepinephrine and vasopressin. In renal artery-ligated rats, KAA8, at 15 mg/kg i.v., decreased mean blood pressure from 148 +/- 3 to 119 +/- 4 mm Hg at 10 min postinjection (n = 9) and greatly inhibited the pressor response to AII but not to vasopressin. In contrast, a control immunoglobulin G1 molecule did not change mean blood pressure or influence the pressor effect of AII in this model. Pretreatment with captopril or saralasin, but not prazosin or hydralazine, blocked the antihypertensive effect of KAA8 in these renal hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the antibody KAA8 displays specific functional AII antagonism and, as such, may represent a specific probe for studying the physiologic roles of AII.\r"

Log dose/effect curves were established for i.m. insulin in adult male rats. The effects measured were the maximum change in plasma glucose concentration and the cumulative percentage of change in plasma glucose concentrations from 0 to 4 hr. Both log dose/effect curves gave similar results when calculating the efficacy of other routes, relative to i.m. Nasal, buccal, sublingual and rectal absorption sites were isolated by ligation procedures or with physical barriers. Rectal insulin was more efficacious than nasal, buccal and sublingual insulin, when administered without an absorption-promoting adjuvant. However, the efficacy relative to i.m. insulin was low for each route, probably due to a combination of slow membrane permeation and metabolism at the absorption site. Administration in a solution containing 5% sodium glycocholate, an absorption-promoting adjuvant, increased insulin efficacy by each route. The rank order was nasal greater than rectal greater than buccal greater than sublingual, with nasal and rectal insulin being roughly half as efficacious as i.m. insulin. Orally administered insulin, at doses 5 times higher than administered by other routes, and with Na glycocholate, produced no hypoglycemic response.\r"

This assay is not only rapid and reliable, but also simple and relatively inexpensive and sparing of test substances. We refined the method by which neonatal mouse hearts are transplanted into pouches in the pinnae of ears of adult recipient mice and used cyclosporine treatment as an example of how this method might be generally applied to study the dose-response relationship of immunosuppressive drugs. Five- to 10-week-old C3H/km mice were used as cardiac recipients, and unsexed newborn BALB/c (allograft) or C3H/km (isograft) mice (24-48 hr old) were used as cardiac graft donors. The heart grafts were examined by two independent observers every other day at 10- to 20-fold magnification for up to 14 days. The immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine was studied at doses of 3, 7.5, 15, 22.5 and 30 mg/kg per day administered i.p. The accrued data were analyzed by two methods: dose-response curves at days 12 and 14 and mean survival scores from day 8 to day 14. The dose-response curves on days 12 and 14 were similar, and the calculated ED50 values were 9.83 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the potential usefulness and the sensitivity of the ear-heart transplantation bioassay for relative potency evaluations of immunosuppressive drugs.\r"

Conscious normotensive Wistar rats were used in this study and all treatments were given intracisternally. Pretreatment with the opiate receptor antagonist naltrexone resulted in a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve for alpha-methyldopa, both for blood pressure and heart rate. In addition, when increasing doses of naltrexone and a constant dose of alpha-methyldopa were used the opiate receptor antagonist inhibited dose-dependently alpha-methyldopa-induced hypotension but not the bradycardia. Administration of naltrexone after the injection of alpha-methyldopa failed to reverse or inhibit alpha-methyldopa-induced hypotension, indicating that the interaction between alpha-methyldopa and the endogenous opioid system occurs at the start of the action of alpha-methyldopa. An antiserum against endorphins also inhibited the fall in blood pressure after alpha-methyldopa. These findings indicate that stimulation of opiate receptors, probably by an endorphin, is involved in the mechanism of action of alpha-methyldopa and that this stimulation seems to occur at the start of the action of alpha-methyldopa.\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of neuron-specific (neurotypic) and glia-specific (gliotypic) proteins were used to characterize the toxic effects of triethyltin (TET) on the developing central nervous system. Six proteins, each of which is associated with specific aspects of neuronal and glial development, were evaluated as follows: 1) neurofilament-200, an intermediate filament protein of the neuronal cytoskeleton; 2) synapsin I, a synapse specific, synaptic vesicle localized protein; 3) p38, another synaptic-vesicle localized protein; 4) myelin basic protein, a protein unique to myelin-forming oligodendroglia; 5) glial fibrillary acidic protein, the intermediate filament protein of astrocytes; and 6) beta-tubulin, a constituent primarily of neuronal microtubules. The amount of each protein in homogenates of hippocampus, forebrain and cerebellum, brain regions with different developmental profiles, was determined by radioimmunoassay. After a single administration on postnatal day 5, TET (3 or 6 mg/kg i.p.) caused permanent dose- and region-dependent decrements in brain weight, with the hippocampus being the most affected. These effects were not associated with light microscopic evidence of cytopathology but were accompanied by large dose-, time- and region-dependent alterations in all neurotypic and gliotypic proteins evaluated. On a per structure (total) basis, TET caused permanent decreases in most neurotypic and gliotypic proteins in all areas. On a per milligram of tissue protein (concentration) basis, changes in specific proteins also were observed in all regions but were most prevalent in hippocampus and cerebellum. In hippocampus and cerebellum, decrements in the concentration of neurotypic and gliotypic proteins were observed in the absence of TET-induced decreases in the weights of these structures. The data indicate that 1) neonatal exposure to TET causes permanent deficits in neuronal as well as glial development, 2) the effects of TET are region-dependent but do not appear to be related to region-dependent stages in development and 3) assays of neurotypic and gliotypic proteins may be used to characterize the temporal and regional patterns of neuronal and glial responses to toxic exposures of the developing central nervous system.\r"

Also, PGs, particularly prostacyclin (PGI2), have been shown to stimulate left ventricular receptor reflexes. Thus, the hypothesis that captopril administration results in sensitization of left ventricular reflexes via increased circulating levels of PGs was tested in conscious instrumented dogs. Left ventricular reflexes were stimulated by injecting veratridine into the left circumflex coronary artery through a nonocclusive catheter. Under control conditions, injection of veratridine resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -25 +/- 4.7% from a base line of 97 +/- 4.7 mm Hg and a decrease in heart rate of -28 +/- 3.7% from a base line of 91 +/- 6.6 beats/min. After administration of captopril, veratridine injection resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -43 +/- 4.9% and a decrease in heart rate of -51 +/- 8.5%, both significantly greater effects than before captopril (P less than .05); N = 7). Subsequent administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg), in the presence of captopril reversed the potentiation of the response to veratridine. Thus, after indomethacin, injection of veratridine decreased mean arterial pressure -29 +/- 4.4% and decreased heart rate -28 +/- 4.1%; changes not significantly different from the control response. Similar findings were observed in a separate set of experiments in which heart rate was held constant by cardiac pacing (N = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 283 kidneys with stone burden exceeding 25 mm. pretreatment placement of silicone ureteral stents reduced complications from 26 to 7 per cent and auxiliary procedure rates from 15 to 6 per cent.

In humans the highest concentrations of EGF are found in the urine. We investigated possible interactions between EGF and normal and neoplastic tissues of the urinary system with indirect immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections. A polyclonal antibody directed against mouse EGF but shown to react with human EGF was used in the assays. Positive staining was granular in nature and confined to the cytoplasm. Staining of the renal parenchyma (N = 5) was observed in the epithelium of the proximal and distal tubules and the collecting ducts. There was staining of clear cell (N = 6) and papillary (N = 3) carcinomas of the kidney. Staining of the normal urothelium (N = 5) was limited to superficial cells. All transitional cell (N = 21) and squamous (N = 2) carcinomas of the bladder stained. Subjectively, the staining intensity of the transitional cell carcinomas correlated inversely with tumor differentiation. In light of evidence that internalized, receptor-bound EGF is rapidly degraded, the striking immunohistochemical demonstration of cytoplasmic EGF suggests active synthesis. EGF synthesized by urothelial and renal carcinomas may be involved in an autocrine mechanism of malignant proliferation.\r"

We adapted the Fricke ferrous sulfate radiation dosimeter to examine the chemical effects of high energy shock waves. Significant free radical production was documented. The reaction was dose dependent, predictably increased by acoustic impedance, but curvilinear. A thousand shocks at 18 kilovolts induced the same free radical oxidation as 1100 rad cobalt-60 gamma ionizing irradiation, increasing to 2900 rad in the presence of an air-fluid zone of acoustic impedance. The biological effect of these free radicals was compared to that of cobalt-60 ionizing irradiation by measuring the affect on Chinese hamster cells by clonogenic assay. While cobalt-60 irradiation produced a marked decrease in clonogenic survivors, little effect was noted with high energy shock waves. This suggested that the chemical effects produced by shock waves were either absent or attenuated in the cells, or were inherently less toxic than those of ionizing irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the immunogenicity of the testis by transplanting adult, postnatal, and fetal rat testicular tissue into outbred adult female and male rats for 10 days. Testis grafts were evaluated morphometrically and histologically, and selectively compared to renal grafts previously reported in part. Testis grafts from days 15 to 21 of gestation, and from three, nine, 12 and 15 days after birth showed an overall increase in growth, with maintenance of architecture and minimal lymphocytic infiltrate. In contrast, only fetal renal tissue from days 15 to 17 demonstrated an increase in growth with maintenance of architecture and minimal lymphocytic infiltrate; grafts from later in gestation grew only slightly and showed progressive deterioration in architecture with an increasing lymphocytic infiltrate. Fifteen day fetal testis grafts were also implanted for longer intervals up to 45 days. The fetal testis grafts implanted for 20 and 30 days showed an increase in size with maintenance of architecture and minimal lymphocytic infiltrate. The observed fetal and postnatal testis growth in the non-immunosuppressed adult host makes compelling further studies directed at determining those factors contributing to the decreased immunogenicity of this organ.\r"

We evaluated scrotal ultrasonography as a noninvasive aid in such problematic cases. During a 48-month period 95 patients were hospitalized for treatment of epididymitis; 23 underwent scrotal ultrasonography and 10 required orchiectomy. Analysis of the 21 cases with abnormal findings demonstrated that orchiectomy was necessary in 1 of the 10 patients (10 per cent) with epididymal enlargement only, in 2 of 8 (25 per cent) with epididymal enlargement plus hypoechoic testes and in all 3 with epididymal enlargement plus testicular inhomogeneity (p equals 0.0099). Patients with progressive testicular changes on serial ultrasound examinations uniformly required orchiectomy (5 of 5). Sonographic findings of testicular inhomogeneity correlated with testicular infarction and findings of decreased testicular echogeneity correlated with acute or chronic orchitis. In the appropriate clinical setting gray scale ultrasonography provides objective information supporting the need for surgical intervention in selected patients with complicated epididymitis.\r"

  ".U": "88091148\r", 
  ".W": "The neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the external urethral closure mechanisms still are under debate because the motor fibers that emanate from the sacral plexus and pudendal nerve to supply this segment have not been traced, nor has their functional interrelationship been established. Therefore, we dissected 3 male human cadavers (aged 31 to 69 years) by tracing the entire sacral plexus, particularly the pudendal nerve, from the cauda equina throughout the branching of the nerves to their final destination. The dissection demonstrated that the extrinsic urethral sphincter, formed by the rhabdosphincter around the membranous urethra as well as the levator ani muscle and pelvic floor (especially the transversus perinei muscle), is innervated by somatic nerve fibers that emanate primarily from sacral roots S2 and S3. In 5 patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction electrostimulation of the sacral root and pudendal nerve markedly increased intraurethral closure pressures. Stimulation of the pudendal nerve or its transversus perinei branch alone resulted in an increase in intraurethral closure pressure to 60 to 70 cm. water--an increase similar to that produced by stimulation of the sacral root without neurotomy. By means of neurotomy and/or neural blockade with lidocaine we were able to differentiate between the contributions of each muscular element to the external sphincteric mechanism. Almost 70 per cent of the closure pressure of the external urethral sphincter is induced by stimulation of the S3 ventral root, while the other 30 per cent derives from S2 and S4 neuronal impulses.\r"

The results of comparison of contrast clearance with 99m technetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid clearance in 33 cases showed excellent agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. Reproducibility of the contrast clearance method was confirmed by repeated examination of 10 plasma samples at weekly intervals for 6 weeks, the results of which showed no significant differences. The contrast clearance technique for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate during excretory urography is simple, quick and accurate, and merits further development.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the relationship of the site of venous valvular incompetence to the severity of venous reflux, legs of 71 patients with suspected chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated with Doppler ultrasonography and photoplethysmography. A venous recovery time (VRT) of less than 20 seconds after calf muscle exercise was considered indicative of significant reflux. Average VRTs were brief in 15 legs with stasis changes (10 +/- 7 seconds), longer in 42 legs with edema (26 +/- 23 seconds), and normal in 64 asymptomatic legs (37 +/- 24 seconds) and 16 legs with pain (53 +/- 19 seconds). Average VRTs in limbs with incompetent saphenous veins were abnormal. In limbs with competent superficial veins, only those with incompetent distal deep veins (popliteal and posterior tibial) had abnormal VRTs (14 +/- 10 seconds). VRTs in limbs with no detectable valvular incompetence and in those with incompetence limited to the proximal deep veins (common and superficial femoral) were normal (47 +/- 23 and 42 +/- 27 seconds, respectively). When superficial veins were incompetent, an ankle tourniquet normalized VRTs in 63% of legs with proximal deep venous incompetence and in only 33% of legs with distal deep venous incompetence. It is concluded that venous reflux is largely determined by saphenous and distal deep valvular function and that competence of the proximal valves has little effect. Decreased venous reflux would not be expected after proximal valvular reconstruction.\r"

Statistical significance of variables was determined by the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. There were no statistically significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on the basis of indication for surgery (asymptomatic, 3.9%; asymptomatic but with evidence of enlargement, 4.9%; and symptomatic, 7.2%) or the urgency of operation (elective operation, 4.5%; and urgent operation, 7.1%). Characteristics of the 72 participating surgeons did not influence the operative mortality rate. A family history of AAA was documented in 6.1% of cases and was more common if the patient was female (p = 0.03) and less than 65 years of age (p = 0.04). Patients without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease had a 0.8% mortality rate from cardiac disease compared with 6.2% if any stigmata of coronary disease were present. Prior aortocoronary bypass surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative cardiac events or operative mortality rate. Patients having \"routine\" angiography did not have a less complicated operative course, fewer thrombotic complications, or lower mortality rate than those not having it. Those patients with an inflammatory AAA (4.5%) did not have a significantly higher incidence of pain. Heparin administration (84.8%) did not reduce the complications of graft thrombosis, \"trash,\" distal thrombosis, and/or amputation. The 6.8% of patients requiring suprarenal aortic cross-clamping had a higher incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction (p = 0.02) and intraoperative blood loss (p less than 0.001), but cardiac events were not more frequent. When the aortic cross-clamping time was prolonged (more than 70 minutes), the requirement for crystalloid fluid administration increased (p less than 0.001) and postoperative myocardial infarction was more common (p = 0.004). After ligation of the left renal vein in 7.9%, renal damage or dialysis was more frequent (p = 0.01). Patients having an intra-abdominal graft (tube, 38.5% and biiliac, 30.7%) had fewer wound infections (p = 0.02) and graft thromboses (p less than 0.001) than the patients with a femoral anastomosis. When the internal iliac artery flow was interrupted bilaterally (12%), diarrhea (p = 0.03) and ischemic colitis (p = 0.03) were more frequent complications. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery was carried out in 4.8%. After renal artery bypass in 2.1%, the mortality rate was not increased, but the incidence of transient renal dysfunction was increased (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

No restrictions were placed on the use of HIV antibody serology during that time, although it was recommended that consent be obtained and risk-reduction information be provided. Testing was performed for 275 patients; results for 25 (9%) of these were positive. Nearly half (44%) of the patients had no recognized risk factor for HIV infection recorded in their charts. For an additional 44% of the patients, the test was medically indicated but consent and counseling were not documented. For only 10% of HIV antibody tests was there notation that consent was obtained and that risk-reduction information was provided. These results indicate that HIV antibody testing is often done without consent and that opportunities to provide risk-reduction counseling are being missed.\r"

Patient-controlled analgesia decreases patient anxiety resulting from delays in receiving pain-relieving medication and from the slow onset of analgesic action when these drugs are administered either intramuscularly or in the extradural space. With PCA therapy, patients are reportedly able to maintain a near optimal state of analgesia with minimal sedation and few side effects. The potential for overdose can be minimized if small bolus doses are used with a mandatory lockout interval between successive doses. Finally, studies of the cost-effectiveness of PCA therapy are important if this therapeutic approach is to achieve more widespread acceptance.\r"

The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of surface cultures were calculated daily for the two weeks up to and including the day that a body fluid culture was obtained. Isolates from cultures of material from the ear canal, nasopharynx, axilla, umbilicus, groin, rectum, stomach, and endotracheal tube were rarely the same as those recovered from blood or fluids of the cerebrospinal, joint, pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal spaces. With a frequency of sepsis of 3.3% among patients in our neonatal intensive care unit, the optimum sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of surface cultures were 56%, 82%, and 7.5%, respectively. These values did not improve substantially for any specific times of surface cultures prior to sepsis, for anatomic sites cultured, or for pathogens recovered. We conclude that surface cultures are of limited value in predicting the etiology of sepsis in neonates.\r"
