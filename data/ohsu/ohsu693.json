After a single i.v. bolus of morphine sulphate 10 mg a biexponential decay was observed. Although the distribution and elimination half-lives for morphine were similar to those described in previous studies, a greater total apparent volume of distribution was observed. This was reflected in a greater plasma clearance of morphine than has been reported previously. The concentration of morphine glucuronides remained increased 24 h after administration of morphine; the clinical significance of this remains to be established. The metabolism of morphine was virtually complete, with 4.5% unchanged morphine recovered in urine 24 h after drug administration.\r"

We studied morphine metabolism during the anhepatic phase of orthotopic liver transplantation in seven adult patients. After injection of morphine 10 mg at the beginning of this phase, the plasma and urinary concentrations of unchanged morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide, morphine-6-glucuronide and normorphine were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. Small but measurable concentrations of morphine metabolites were found in the plasma and urine whilst there was no functional liver tissue in the body. Morphine metabolism increased markedly when the new donor liver was reperfused. This suggests that, in these patients, the liver is the primary site for metabolism of morphine.\r"

Cumulative vecuronium dose-response curves were determined for both muscles in 11 ASA class I adult patients. The mean (SD) doses required to depress adductor pollicis and diaphragm responses to 50% (ED50) were 30 (9) micrograms kg-1 and 37 (12) micrograms kg-1, respectively. Corresponding values for 95% depression of the twitch response (ED95) were 48 (13) micrograms kg-1 and 67 (23) micrograms kg-1 (P less than 0.02), indicating that the diaphragm required approximately 40% more vecuronium for subtotal abolition of the single twitch response.\r"

In isolated preparations, the effects of Org 9426 were antagonized by neostigmine. No contracture of the chick muscle preparation occurred. Org 9426 reduced the amplitude of endplate currents (EPC) in rat and snake muscle, but had no major effects on EPC decay characteristics, indicating a lack of endplate channel blocking action. In anaesthetized animals, no fasciculations were observed and the neuromuscular block was associated with tetanic and train-of-four fade and was antagonized by neostigmine. In anaesthetized cats and pigs, Org 9426 was approximately 20% as potent as vecuronium, its onset of action was twice as rapid as that of vecuronium in the cat and its duration of action was similar to that of vecuronium in both cats and pigs. It blocked the bradycardia produced by vagal stimulation only in doses greater than those necessary to produce neuromuscular block (ratios 7.2 in the cat and 4.4 in the pig--10-14% of the corresponding ratios for vecuronium). Ganglion block was seen only at doses several times those producing vagal block. In general the effects of Org 9426 on the cardiovascular system were slight, a small depressor effect occurring at high doses in the cat. The 17-hydroxy analogue, the potential metabolite of Org 9426, was approximately 20 times less potent than Org 9426 and is thus unlikely to contribute to the neuromuscular block produced by the parent compound.\r"

Initial hypotension occurred after induction of anaesthesia, but during the operation, cardiovascular variables were stable. After adequate antagonism of neuromuscular block, respiratory depression persisted in three patients when the two agents were discontinued simultaneously; this was not seen when alfentanil was discontinued 15 min before propofol. Quality of recovery was good, and satisfactory postoperative analgesia was present in the majority of patients 2 h after operation. This study indicates that total i.v. anaesthesia with a combination of alfentanil and propofol appears to be satisfactory in burned patients.\r"

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased significantly from the pre-induction value in all groups 1 min after intubation, and also at 3 min in those with PIH who had not received labetalol. Arterial pressure was significantly greater in both PIH groups than in the control group at all times. However, the percentage increase in MAP on intubation was significantly less in the labetalol treated group than in either the untreated or the control groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in plasma concentrations of either noradrenaline or adrenaline; noradrenaline concentration increased significantly after intubation only in the control group.

Extension at the atlanto-axial joint was probably near maximum; this has implications for conditions associated with laxity of this joint. The position of the mandible was influenced by the direction of pull on the laryngoscope handle. The hyoid was drawn forward and its body tilted downwards so as to lie halfway between the lower border of the mandible and the glottis.

All solutions contained antipyrine as an index of placental exchange. In each rabbit, a single fetal sac was opened, the umbilical vessels were cannulated and the placenta was perfused in situ with buffered Krebs solution containing Dextran. Bupivacaine and antipyrine concentrations were measured in effluent perfusate (fetal) and in maternal plasma sampled simultaneously. Mean maternal arterial pressure and mean placental perfusion pressure were not altered by adrenaline. Fetal:maternal concentration (F:M) ratios of antipyrine decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) during the second half of the experiment. In contrast, F:M ratios of bupivacaine were unchanged during the time course of the experiment and unaltered by the addition of adrenaline. It is concluded that neither adrenaline nor minor alterations in maternal placental flow affect placental transfer of bupivacaine.\r"

The nerves were maintained at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 using an electrolyte solution equilibrated with 5% carbon dioxide. A fibres were the most, and C fibres the least, sensitive to block at low frequency stimulation (0.0167 Hz). Equipotent concentrations of the various drugs blocked C fibres at approximately the same rate. Rate of A fibre block was related to physicochemical properties of individual drugs. Low pKa and high lipid solubility favoured block of A fibres before C, whereas the reverse was true for high pKa and low solubility. Absolute potency was related to lipid solubility, but each type of local anaesthetic drug in clinical use has a different inherent potency. With stimulation at high frequencies (20 and 40 Hz), C fibres were more sensitive to use-dependent block than A fibres; this effect was more marked with drugs containing an amide than an ester linkage. Molecular size and lipid solubility may inter-react to govern the ability to produce use dependent block. Agents which contain an amide linking group, have a high pKa and are of low lipid solubility, may be used to produce differential C fibre block.\r"

Control recordings were made, followed by bolus administration of verapamil 0.08, 0.16 and 0.32 mg kg-1, with recordings 10 min after each bolus. At the highest dose, verapamil decreased systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular dP/dt, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance, and increased heart rate significantly. Coronary perfusion pressure decreased and, in the presence of critical constriction, coronary flow per beat decreased significantly. In the region with constriction, systolic shortening of myocardium decreased and post-systolic shortening increased significantly with addition of verapamil.

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that segmental thoracic extradural block causes sympathetic denervation caudally beyond dermatomes rendered analgesic, we have measured regional skin temperatures in six conscious dogs after upper thoracic, mid thoracic, and lumbar extradural injection of 0.5% bupivacaine 0.5, 1 and 2 ml cumulatively (total dose: 3.5 ml) given at 45-min intervals. Dogs were studied at constant ambient and rectal temperatures. Upper thoracic extradural injections resulted in a significant increase in skin temperatures on both the front (+1.4 (SEM 0.2) degrees C) and hind paw (+1.4 (0.3) degrees C), while the area of analgesia was confined to the upper trunk. With lumbar extradural injection, skin temperatures increased significantly (+2.0 (0.5) degrees C) on the lower extremities only. Mid thoracic injection significantly increased both front (+2.4 (0.9) degrees C) and hind paw (+2.2 (0.6) degrees C) skin temperatures, but decreased temperatures on the thorax (-0.9 (0.2) degrees C) and abdomen (-1.0 (0.2) degrees C), reversing the normal temperature gradient along the body axis. Irrespective of the injection site, skin temperatures on the trunk failed to increase or even decreased significantly. These data suggest that small doses of local anaesthetics applied to the extradural space of conscious dogs cause increased lower extremity skin temperatures caudal to areas unresponsive to pinprick stimulation when injected at a high thoracic level, and decreased trunk skin temperature even in analgesic areas, so that skin temperature measurements are unlikely to reflect purely sympathetic efferent activity on the trunk. Upper thoracic segmental extradural analgesia induced a decrease in sympathetic tone distal to the area of analgesia.\r"

The oesophagus was divided and closed at its upper end and replaced with a segment of colon. The fistula remained in situ and fundoplication was performed to allow drainage of the oesophageal remnant but prevent reflux of gastric contents. During a subsequent anaesthetic, gross intestinal distension occurred when gas that had passed through the fistula was unable to vent. The problems of dealing with patients with malignant tracheo-oesophageal fistula are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In Western Australia during the period 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1987 1089 eyes of 1044 patients in hospital were operated upon for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment due to causes other than penetrating trauma. Of these eyes 295 (27%) were aphakic or pseudophakic. During this period the annual number of cataract operations in the State increased by a factor of 245%, while aphakic and pseudophakic retinal detachment operations rose by only 55%. The declining risk of retinal detachment following cataract surgery is attributed to improvements in microsurgical techniques. In 1983 and 1984 the incidence of aphakic and pseudophakic retinal detachments dropped significantly (p less than 0.05). At about this time extracapsular cataract surgery became widespread in the State, and this may explain the observed fall in retinal detachment operations. Since 1984 the incidence has risen owing to the rapidly increasing prevalence of pseudophakia in the resident population.\r"

  ".U": "90057298\r", 
  ".W": "Preservation solutions for short-term storage of isolated donor corneas for use in penetrating keratoplasty have all been based on tissue culture medium, on the assumption that media designed to maintain the viability of cells at physiological temperatures will also provide suitable conditions for preservation at reduced temperatures. But for hypothermic preservation of some other tissues and organs, when ionic pumps are inhibited, it is unnecessary to support metabolism, and beneficial control of ion and water distribution between intra- and extracellular compartments is achieved by storage in appropriately formulated 'intracellular-type' solutions. We have therefore designed a solution that will restrict ionic imbalances and minimise endothelial cell swelling in corneas during exposure at reduced temperatures. This potassium-rich solution contains the biological pH buffer TES as an impermeant anion and is designated CPTES (corneal-potassium-TES). The structural and functional integrity of rabbit corneas stored at 0 degrees C in CPTES, without the addition of colloid osmotic agents, is compared with that of corneas stored in glutathione bicarbonate Ringers' solution (GBR), an 'extracellular-type' medium formulated for the maintenance of endothelial integrity during in-vitro perfusion at 34 degrees C. Corneas swelled significantly less during storage in CPTES than in GBR and could be stored for five days before reaching the same degree of hydration as corneas stored for only three days in GBR. Gross structural integrity and endothelial ultrastructure were maintained during storage for three and five days in CPTES. The rate of thinning of corneas stored in CPTES was significantly greater than in comparable groups of corneas stored in GBR. However, the efficient dehydration of corneas stored in CPTES was always preceded during perfusion by a brief period of additional swelling which was shown to be an osmotic response during the elution of the buffer compound TES that had permeated the stroma during storage. The omission of calcium or the addition of adenosine and glutathione to the CPTES preservation medium had no detectable effect on the integrity of the endothelium, but the omission of bicarbonate was beneficial, producing significantly higher rates of stromal thinning during normothermic perfusion. Additional benefits for extending storage by including colloid osmotic agents are described in a companion paper.\r"

It is generally held that proptosis is mild in intraorbital glioma, but we encountered marked proptosis ranging from 7 to 12 mm in six of the eight intraorbital gliomas, which contained abundant Alcian-blue-positive mucoid material. Of the patients with intracranial optic nerve gliomas 37.5% survived for a mean of eight years after treatment with radiotherapy or surgery combined with radiotherapy. At follow-up ranging from five months to 11 years only one of the six patients with intracranial gliomas had full visual acuity. Our observations emphasise that, although optic nerve gliomas are benign hamartomas, the prognosis for visual acuity and survival is unfavourable in cases which are diagnosed and treated late. Histopathological and histochemical observations suggest that increase in the amount of mucoid material may contribute to rapid enlargement of intraorbital and intracranial optic gliomas.\r"

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) run according to the method of Laemmli, we noticed two gamma chain species in fibrinogen and its plasmic fragments D1 and D2, consisting of a normal species and an apparently lower molecular weight (mol wt) variant in respective fractions. However, in fragment D3 only a single gamma chain remnant was observed. By chromatofocusing of the plasmic-CaCl2 digests of the abnormal fibrinogen, we separately isolated the normal and abnormal D1 species, the latter having been eluted in a slightly higher pH range. As expected, the abnormal D1 species failed to interfere with thrombin clotting of normal fibrinogen and normal fibrin monomer polymerization, whereas the normal D1 species inhibited them markedly. By analyzing the lysyl endopeptidase digests of the isolated gamma chain, we identified a replacement of aspartic acid by tyrosine at position 330 of the mutant gamma chain. The point mutation from an aspartic acid (pK for the beta-carboxyl = 3.86) to a tyrosine (pK for the aromatic hydroxyl = 10.07) may have perturbed the folding gamma chain structure in the D domain of fibrinogen specifically required for polymerization.\r"

Beads were prepared by continuous emulsion polymerization in the absence of surfactant. Coomassie brilliant blue staining of gel electropherograms of desorbed proteins indicated that the presence of small amounts of comonomers (1 to 10 mole %) significantly influenced the composition of the adsorbed protein layer. Immunoblotting revealed that fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin were adsorbed by all surfaces investigated. C3 and Clq adsorption varied significantly with copolymer composition. The ELISAs revealed that although the concentrations of vitronectin and fibronectin in plasma are similar, the extent of vitronectin adsorption from 70% to 85% plasma was greater by two orders of magnitude than fibronectin adsorption. Vitronectin adsorbed on carboxylic acid-containing copolymers reacted more strongly with a conformationally sensitive antivitronectin monoclonal antibody (MoAb) than vitronectin adsorbed to polystyrene and was more susceptible to cleavage by plasma proteases(s). The results show that vitronectin is a major protein adsorbed from concentrated plasma and that small changes in the chemical composition of a copolymer profoundly affects the extent and nature of protein adsorption from complex mixtures such as plasma.\r"

In the present study, the clinical efficacy of SADA detecting relapse in 32 acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) patients in remission was tested. The observation period ranged from 3 to 17 months. A simple and rapid biochemical technique based on spectrophotometric measurements was used to assay SADA. Of the 32 patients, 17 remained in remission and had less than a 15% variation in SADA levels. They had no clinical symptoms of recurrence at any time. In the remaining 15 patients, after a period of stability, a progressive decrease in SADA, with variations of more than 15%, was observed without any treatment. At that time, no abnormalities of clinical parameters were detected in these patients. A recurrence of disease as evidenced by routine examinations was found relatively late after the first decrease in SADA in all 15 patients (range 1.5 to 5.5 months). These results suggest that periodic measurements of SADA during the posttherapeutic course can be used as a means to assess early detection of an eventual recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of a known retroviral trans-activating factor, HTLV-I tax1, on transcription of human globin genes. Transfection of HeLa cells by the cloned tax1 gene stimulated activity of both the beta- and epsilon-globin promoters approximately 20-fold, as measured by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays. Studies of promoter 5'-deletion mutants revealed that the trans-activation response required only 185 base pairs (bp) of beta-globin 5'-flanking sequence or 177 bp of epsilon-globin 5' flanking sequence. These promoter regions contain either two (for beta) or three (for epsilon) copies of the pentanucleotide sequence CTGAC, which is characteristic of previously described tax1-responsive promoters. We also stably transfected tax1 into the erythroid cell line K562. Transfectants expressing tax1 showed increased transcription of epsilon-, gamma-, zeta-, and alpha-globins. This indicates that tax1 can stimulate transcription of globin genes in their native chromosomal location. This was confirmed by measurements of increases in intracellular hemoglobin as determined by an increased percentage of cells staining with benzidine and by spectrophotometric measurements of hemoglobin. The observed trans-activation of globin genes by tax1 may provide insight into normal regulation of globin genes by clarifying cis regulatory sequences. Furthermore, it suggests that the trans-acting effects of tax1 on heterologous genes are more widespread than was previously appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a limiting-dilution assay of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells in the mouse using a miniturized stroma-dependent bone marrow culture assay in vitro. The cells were overlaid on irradiated stromal layers in microtiter wells in a range of concentrations, and frequencies of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) were calculated by employing Poisson statistics. The production of secondary granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-G/M) in the adherent layer of individual wells was correlated with the presence of such cobblestone areas. CAFC frequencies were determined in bone marrow cell suspensions that were either enriched for marrow repopulating ability (MRA) in vivo, while depleted for spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S), or vice versa. The separation of bone marrow cells (BMC) was either based on centrifugal elutriation, or monoclonal antibody-mediated magnetic depletion of cells carrying cell surface differentiation antigens, and subsequent sorting on the basis of light scatter and rhodamine-123 retention as a measure of mitochondrial activity. In addition, 5-fluorouracil-resistant BMC were studied. Our investigations show that a time-dependent cobblestone area formation exists that reflects the turnover time and primitiveness of CAFC. The frequency of precursors forming cobblestone areas on day 28 after overlay is proposed to be a measure for MRA, whereas the day-7 CAFC frequency closely corresponds with day-12 CFU-S numbers in the suspensions tested.\r"

  ".W": "Serial serum protein electrophoreses were performed on 60 patients undergoing allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). More than 50% of patients (31 of 60) developed transient oligoclonal and monoclonal gammopathies that appeared an average of 84 days posttransplantation (range 27 to 336 days) and persisted an average of 175 days (range 14 to 652 days). Immunofixation analysis revealed 82% of the M components to be of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type and 18% to be IgM; 56% were kappa and 44% were lambda. A strong correlation between development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and appearance of M components was observed (73% incidence in GVHD patients v 27% in non-GVHD patients, P = .0003). Two of the three syngeneic graft recipients also developed monoclonal gammopathies. Evidence of oligoclonal circulating B-cell populations was found in 68% of patients posttransplantation by flow cytometric B-cell clonal excess assay. No correlation of recovery of particular B- or T-lymphocyte subsets and development of M components was seen. The development of transient oligoclonal and monoclonal gammopathies after transplantation may be a ubiquitous finding reflecting recapitulation of early B-cell ontogeny.\r"

Rather, it considers a selected number of issues that may pertain to some future understanding of the current controversy. Furthermore, certain issues such as biological plausibility and the absence of a definitive dose, duration, or timing relationships are not discussed. If the association of the use of exogenous female hormones with the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis came to be accepted as likely causal, basic scientists might well unravel the biological processes involved. The dose and duration of exposure to the hormones and the timing of the exposure (current use versus past use) in relation to the preventative effect remains unclear. While clearly a point against a causal relationship the possibility exists that this may result from errors in recall or that prior hormone exposure may 'vaccinate' a woman against the disease. A number of studies have been published only in abstract or are still underway. Reanalysis of existing data sets may also provide some insight into the contradictory findings. The issues raised in this review are of relevance to investigators. They may also be used by readers interested in this topic who wish to attempt to resolve the conflicts in the hormone-rheumatoid arthritis literature for themselves.\r"

An excellent correlation (r = 0.999) was found between the densitometric weight (mu) and the corresponding dry weight (m) of the analysed bone samples and a calibration factor mu/m = 1.38 was established. The total random error was low, the coefficient of variation (CV) amounting to less than 5% or, if duplicate analyses were performed, less than 3%. The accuracy was not impaired when radiography was carried out with addition of water to mimic overlying soft tissue in the model. The method was applied to the assessment of callus mass longitudinally in vivo in the healing of a bone defect in the rabbit radius, yielding reproducible values (CV less than 5%) and a quantitative analysis of the healing sequence.\r"

Bone scans showed no evidence of hyperaemia on the vascular phase and revealed a fusiform focus of increased uptake in the postero-medial cortex of the lower femoral diaphysis on the 3-h images. Computed tomography showed increased attenuation of the medulla due to fibrosis and an absence of a soft-tissue mass.

Therefore, body and skin temperatures were measured in six subjects before (20 min), during (30 min) and after (20 min) MRI procedures performed at specific absorption rates (SARs) six to 10 times higher than the limit recommended by the UK National Radiological Protection Board. Body temperature was unchanged throughout the experiment. Abdominal skin temperature increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during MRI, decreased significantly post-MRI, but was still significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than baseline. The highest abdominal skin temperature recorded was 36 degrees C. Upper arm, forearm and chest skin temperatures increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during MRI and remained elevated post-MRI. The highest skin temperatures recorded on the upper arm, forearm and chest were 38.1, 36.0 and 34.5 degrees C, respectively. Thigh and calf skin temperatures were not significantly changed during MRI. These alterations in tissue temperatures were physiologically trivial and easily tolerated by the subjects, suggesting that the recommended exposure to RF radiation during MRI of the body for patients with normal thermoregulatory function may be too conservative.\r"

Such photons interact with tissue predominantly through the photoelectric effect, producing low-energy electrons that have different patterns of energy deposition at the cellular level compared with those from higher-energy X rays. These differences result in low doses of typical molybdenum-based mammography X rays having an estimated radiobiological effectiveness of approximately 1.3 compared with 80 kVp or 250 kVp X rays, and approximately 2 compared with higher-energy gamma rays. Thus the risk from mammography could be higher, by such factors, than previously estimated. This would result in the optimal age for beginning mammographic screening, derived from risk-benefit ratios, being increased by at least 1-2 years and possibly by as many as 10 years.\r"

  ".U": "90057951\r", 
  ".W": "The evidence for residual radiation-induced injury has been investigated in the dermal vascular/connective tissue of pig skin at intervals of 17-52 weeks after irradiation. The primary irradiation was a single dose of 18 Gy, which represents the upper limit of \"tolerance\" to X irradiation of pig dermal tissue. Re-irradiation was with graded single doses of X rays in order to establish dose-effect relationships for the incidence of late ischaemic dermal necrosis of the skin; dose-effect curves obtained for previously irradiated skin were compared with those obtained using previously unirradiated skin in the same group of animals. At intervals of 17, 35 and 52 weeks after the primary treatment the resulting ED50 values for dermal necrosis were not significantly different from those obtained for previously unirradiated skin. This suggests little or no effective residual injury at these time intervals after a primary full \"tolerance\" dose. This conclusion was supported by the findings for the latency time for the development of dermal necrosis, which were similar in re-irradiated and previously unirradiated skin. Epithelial desquamation was not induced by the doses used in these studies, either after the primary treatment or after re-irradiation; however, the early erythema reactions seen in re-irradiated skin were markedly reduced, particularly when this was carried out after 35 and 52 weeks, when compared with skin that had not previously been irradiated. This suggests that the early erythema reaction may be a particularly poor predictor of late effects after the re-irradiation of the skin. Although the present results suggest that dermal and subcutaneous tissues may safely be retreated with a full tolerance dose at relatively early times after an initial radical treatment, caution is recommended in extrapolating these results to other late-responding normal tissues. In other tissues some persistent injury may be present even at very long time intervals after the primary treatment.\r"

These data were then used in conjunction with phantom-based radiation dose measurements to calculate entrance skin dose and total energy imparted for each patient. Values of 142 mGy and 53 mJ, respectively, were found. In the case of energy imparted, 20% of the total arose from film radiography, 30% from electronic radiography and the remaining 50% from fluoroscopy. The estimated effective dose-equivalent, HE, to the average patient undergoing lithotripsy was 0.75 mSv. This corresponds to an estimated radiation risk for the induction of fatal cancers and genetic defects (in the first two generations of offspring) of between 5 and 11 per million.\r"

Treatment techniques using moving beam therapy with fields asymmetric with respect to rotational axis of the collimator head allow treatment of such target volumes with minimal dose to critical structures. The availability of independent motion of the collimator jaws on new medical accelerators allows easy setting up of asymmetric treatment portals. Therefore, treatment techniques utilizing asymmetric field arc rotations with acceptable dose distributions have been possible.\r"

  ".W": "Transplanted C3H mouse mammary tumours were given single doses of X irradiation in air or oxygen at 1 atmosphere (atm) with or without anaesthesia of the recipient mice by ketamine and diazepam. The radiation response to single doses of 25 Gy was determined in terms of the time taken to reach 3.5 times the treatment volume. Under all conditions there was more growth delay in tumours irradiated in pure oxygen than in air. In both air and oxygen, the radiation response for anaesthetized animals tended to fall below the level for non-anaesthetized ones when only 10 min had elapsed after the administration of anaesthesia. After 25 min, the response in air was back to the level for the non-anaesthetized animals but the oxygen group now showed significant sensitization compared with the oxygen without anaesthetic group. After 40 min, the air group now showed slight sensitization and the oxygen group still showed significant sensitization by the anaesthetic. These results demonstrate the importance of the time interval between anaesthesia and irradiation of mouse tumours.\r"

This variation can be ascribed to the presence of a relatively large low-energy neutron component emanating from the neutron source. As part of the pre-clinical calibration programme at a newly commissioned neutron therapy facility, radiobiological and microdosimetric observations were made to determine the magnitude of this effect on a p(66)Be(40) beam and to evaluate the hardening effect of a hydrogenous filter. The reported data identify a correlation between the two assays and quantify a linear relationship between y* and filter thicknesses less than or equal to 6 cm. Using the data obtained in the study, a filter thickness was selected to comply with clinical requirements. By employing lineal energy spectra, it is demonstrated that subtle changes in beam quality may be quantified in a reproducible manner without resorting to time-consuming radiobiological studies.\r"

Three-hourly urine samples were collected and creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid and inorganic phosphate were estimated. The time series of data were analysed by cosinor rhythmometry. Circadian rhythmicity has been described in urinary volume and urinary excretion of creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid and inorganic phosphate in normal subjects, but it was not detected in the stone formers. The control subjects exhibited a circadian rhythmicity only in urinary volume and creatinine excretion. Thus they occupied a position midway between healthy adults, who exhibit circadian rhythmicity in all of the above parameters, and the stone formers, who appear to have lost it altogether.\r"

Eighteen patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter were given a 0.5 h intravenous infusion of the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (500 mg) at the time of surgery to label tumour cells in the DNA synthesis phase. The tumour specimens were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The BrdU labelling index, S phase fraction, was determined by counting the number of bromodeoxy-uridine labelled cells in the tissue sections. All grade 1 tumours had an S phase fraction lower than 10%. The average S phase fraction for non-invasive tumour (12 cases) and invasive tumour (6 cases) were 9.7 and 20.9%, respectively. Two patients with rapid spread of ureteric tumour showed an S phase fraction of 18.4 and 22.3%. The results obtained with the S phase fraction were comparable with histological tumour grade and invasive potential. The higher S phase fraction may indicate greater biological malignancy. We believe that determination of the S phase fraction of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter offers a new objective and quantitative assay of the biological potential of individual tumours and might have practical value in their management.\r"

The patients comprised 2 groups: 4 reported occasional episodes of stress incontinence, all of whom had closed bladder necks; the remaining 25 patients were totally asymptomatic. Overall a 21% incidence of an open bladder neck was recorded. It is likely that the true incidence of open bladder necks in young nulliparous women is higher than this, since none of these patients had troublesome stress incontinence. Since women with open bladder necks are more likely to develop stress incontinence if the integrity of the distal sphincter mechanism is compromised by neural damage, antenatal recognition of this problem should provide a contraindication to traumatic vaginal delivery and may in the future reduce the incidence of symptomatic stress incontinence in the population.\r"

Of those with probable MSA, 16 were found to have an abnormal urethral sphincter EMG. In the group with possible MSA, only 5 patients had an abnormal EMG while in the group with probable IPD, only 1 patient had an abnormal EMG. It was concluded that urethral sphincter electromyography provides a useful method of distinguishing between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. It also provides a means of identifying those patients with parkinsonism whose incontinence may well be worsened, or in whom incontinence may develop following lower urinary tract surgery.\r"

After TUR both the speed and the amplitude of isometric detrusor contractions during the stop test increased. A pre-operative low detrusor pressure increase was correlated with a great improvement in flow rate after TUR. The value of the stop-flow test was limited, however, since improvement in other urodynamic parameters could not be predicted.\r"

  ".W": "Maximal electrical stimulation (MES) administered from a laboratory device designed to deliver stimulation pulses of relatively high voltages and currents was performed in 29 patients. All had suffered from bladder overactivity for several years, either idiopathic detrusor instability or an uninhibited overactive bladder, and all had failed to respond to conservative treatment. MES was performed in female patients by means of intravaginal and intra-anal electrode carriers and in males by anal electrodes only. In some cases additional stimulation was administered by means of a single needle bipolar electrode inserted directly into the pudendal nerve. Maximal amplitude was attained after gradual increases in amplitude and the patient's adaptation to this. Stimulation was administered by the therapist but the amplitudes were determined by the patient and limited by his/her pain threshold. Alternating rectangular constant voltage pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz were used. Treatment consisted of 4 sessions of stimulation with intervals of 1 week between each application. All patients showed a significant increase in functional bladder capacity and 11 reported a 30% decrease in the frequency of micturition. Two patients were unaffected by stimulation with external electrodes but responded well to direct pudendal nerve stimulation. MES seems to be an effective first-line treatment for the uninhibited overactive bladder.\r"

The initial morphological response to urethral obstruction was a reduction of approximately 50% in the density of autonomic nerves in the bladder wall which occurred within the first 3 months. During this period the morphology of smooth muscle cells and the distribution of connective tissue were unaltered. Longer periods of obstruction produced a gradual further reduction in the density of innervation. However, from 3 months onwards the detrusor muscle bundles became infiltrated by connective tissue, although significant change in muscle cell size was not detected after obstruction for 12 months. Using electron microscopy, smooth muscle cells were observed to possess extensive amounts of perinuclear granular reticulum, this feature being particularly marked in bladders subjected to longer periods of obstruction. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these structural changes remain to be determined.\r"

Progressive disease (pT2 or greater) developed within 3 years in 35% (6/17) of patients with poorly differentiated tumours, 35% (8/23) with aneuploid tumours and 35% (7/20) of those with a high proportion of \"S\"-phase nuclei. Of 8 tumours with all 3 features, progressive disease developed in 6 cases (75%). Of 9 patients who developed progressive disease, 8 (89%) had aneuploid tumours. Progressive disease did not develop in 11 patients with well differentiated tumours, compared with 4% (1/24) in diploid/tetraploid tumours and 7% (2/27) in those with a low/medium percentage of \"S\"-phase nuclei. In contrast to muscle-invasive disease, recurrent superficial tumours developed with a high incidence in all groups. Only 6/56 patients (11%) remained alive and disease-free for 3 years. It is concluded that these 3 features are of similar prognostic significance and accuracy in identifying patients requiring more aggressive therapy.\r"

All patients over the age of 80 who underwent prostatectomy in a 2-year period were studied retrospectively; 90 such patients underwent 94 operations, 90 of which were TURPs. Serious concomitant disease was found in 64 patients (71%) and 11 (12%) had had a previous prostatectomy at least 1 year before. The mean weight of tissue removed was 24.8 g. In 18 men histology showed malignant change. Two men died from cardiovascular disease immediately after surgery (2.1%); a further 5 patients (7.8%) died within 6 months. Post-operative morbidity was high, with 64 patients (71%) developing complications. These were related to pre-operative urinary tract infections and uraemia. Nevertheless, at 6 weeks 72 patients (80%) were considered to have had a satisfactory result. Prostatectomy in the over 80-year-old has a good long-term outcome. Although the morbidity rate is high, these patients should be considered for operation provided they undergo careful pre-operative assessment.\r"

Patients with gastric disorders and those taking medications that affect gastric motility or secretion were excluded. No premedicant drugs were given. Following induction of general anesthesia the gastric fluid was aspirated through an orogastric tube, its volume recorded and its pH measured with a calibrated pH meter. The patients were retrospectively assigned to one of four groups according to the interval from last fluid ingestion until induction of anesthesia (less than 3 hours, 3 to 4.9 hours, 5 to 8 hours and nothing after midnight). The mean values and extremes for gastric fluid volume and pH were similar in the four groups. We conclude that healthy patients should be allowed to ingest fluid until 3 hours before elective ambulatory surgery.\r"

It was one of four provincial surveillance systems on which the federal government relied for baseline statistics of congenital anomalies. The government now collects data from six provinces and one territory. The Alberta Congenital Anomaly Surveillance System originally depended on three types of notification to the Division of Vital Statistics, Department of Health, Government of Alberta: birth notice and certificates of death and stillbirth; increased sources of ascertainment have greatly improved data quality. We present the data for 1980-86 and compare the prevalence rates of selected anomalies with the rates from three other surveillance systems. Surveillance systems do not guarantee that a new teratogen will be detected, but they are extremely valuable for testing hypotheses regarding causation. At the very least they provide baseline data with which to compare any deviation or trend. For many, if not most, congenital anomalies total prevention is not possible; however, surveillance systems can be used to measure progress in prevention.\r"

The first 12 patients were treated with 19 courses of AZQ 30 mg/m2 X 3 days and AAFC 600 mg/m2/dose every 12 hours X 10 doses. An additional patient was treated with three courses at 80% of the above doses. Hepatic toxicity was National Cancer Institute Grade III in eight of 22 and Grade IV in one of 22 courses. Infectious complications were severe in all patients, including responders. One patient achieved a complete remission and one a partial remission; the latter died with marrow aplasia after a second course. Altogether three patients developed profound aplasia and died before marrow recovery. The authors treated a second group of 17 patients with AZQ 22.5 mg/m2/day X 3 days and AAFC 450 mg/m2/dose every 12 hours X 10 doses. Three patients achieved a complete remission and one patient a partial remission for 3, 4, 9, and 9 months, respectively. The remainder had progressive disease or no response. All patients developed profound myelosuppression but no toxic deaths occurred. Hepatic toxicity was reduced. Therapy induced cytoreduction of bone marrow was determined by flow cytometry in ten patients; none of these patients responded during the interval studied. Although AZQ and AAFC are active in childhood ANLL with acceptable toxicity, the combination does not appear more active than AZQ used alone. Future studies should define the role of AZQ in combination with other agents.\r"

From August 1985 to June 1988, 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 13 patients with metastatic liver tumors were treated with this agent at the Kumamoto University Hospital and its affiliated hospitals. The response rate (complete remission [CR] and partial remission [PR]) was 27.6% for hepatocellular carcinomas and 46.1% for metastatic liver tumors. The cumulative 1-year survival rate was 55.1% for hepatocellular carcinomas and 70.0% for metastatic liver tumors. More than a 50% decrease in the tumor marker level was observed in ten of 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in two of eight patients with metastatic liver tumors.

Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 36% +/- 9% of patients, of whom 11% required the addition of surgical resection of residual disease. Although 68% of CR patients have relapsed, CR median survival will exceed 38 months compared with 11 months for partial (36%) and minor (6%) responders, and 8 months for nonresponders: 2-year and 3-year survivals were 68% and 55%, respectively, versus 0% to 7% for the remaining patients. Sixteen percent of responders developed brain lesions, half of whom had no systemic relapse at the time of progression. Three patients with non-TCC histologies did not respond. In 32 patients who had pathologic restaging, the clinical (T) understaging (T less than pathologic [P] restaging) error was 35%. Although all metastatic sites showed evidence of tumor regression, CR was noted more frequently in lung, in intraabdominal lymph nodes and masses, and in bone (24% to 35%); the rate for hepatic lesions was 15%. There were 52% of 21 N3-4M0 patients who achieved CR versus 33% of 100 with N0-+M+ lesions. Toxicity was significant with 4 (3%) drug-related deaths, 25% incidence of nadir sepsis, 58% greater than or equal to 3+ myelosuppression, and 49% with mucositis. Responsiveness of metastasis in various sites, patterns of relapse, and the usefulness of the new CR response criteria are reported, as is the current status of cisplatin and methotrexate combination regimens.\r"

  ".W": "A 56-year-old patient with multiple myeloma experienced an extravasation of doxorubicin (DOX) and vincristine administered as a 96-hour infusion. An unknown quantity of solution (2.1 mg/ml of DOX and 0.1 mg/ml of vincristine) extravasated into the medial aspect of the right upper arm. This was caused by the axillary blockage of a 14-inch, 18-gauge catheter that had been inserted through the antecubital fossa. The only physical complaint mentioned by the patient was a dull muscle ache. No local swelling or redness was apparent until 2 weeks after the extravasation occurred, at which time surgical debridement yielded a 9.2 x 4 x 2-cm section of fascia and thrombosed vein with a normal-appearing margin. A high performance liquid chromatography analysis of different tissue areas in the surgical specimen yielded DOX levels of 1.25 to 7.94 micrograms/g of wet tissue weight. These levels are approximately tenfold higher than those of any previous extravasation reports. Slightly lower levels of the DOX aglycone (but no doxorubicinol) were recovered from these tissues. An important finding was the DOX level of 2.7 micrograms/g in the margin of the specimen, predicting a need for further surgery. Indeed, a second debridement was performed 1 week later, followed by a split thickness skin graft. Although the myeloma remains in clinical remission, use of the effected right arm is limited primarily by skin contracture at the graft site. This case demonstrates that high DOX levels can be deposited in soft tissues during prolonged DOX infusions without producing severe acute symptomatology. Furthermore, an analysis of DOX content in excised tissues may help guide the surgical management of the patient experiencing an extravasation.\r"

The mode of invasion was classified into infiltrative and expanding types. Average diameter of tumor at the serosal or subserosal layer for the infiltrative type was 4.2 +/- 3.2 cm, a value significantly greater than that of 2.5 +/- 2.0 cm for the expanding type (P less than 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of patients with the infiltrative type carcinoma was significantly lower (36.8%) than that with the expanding type carcinoma (50.0%) (P less than 0.05). In the infiltrative type, the survival time of patients with a serosal invasion exceeding 2 cm was significantly shorter than when the serosal invasion was less than 2 cm (P less than 0.05). In the expanding type, however, the prognosis was good until the width of serosal invasion extended to 4 cm or greater. The difference in survival according to the width of serosal invasion did not always depend on the incidence of positive lymph nodes in both types of carcinomas. Therefore, influence of the width of serosal invasion on the prognosis for advanced gastric carcinomas differs between infiltrative and expanding types.\r"

During the 2 to 10 subsequent years, 16 patients developed symptoms of the myelodysplastic syndrome, i.e., chronic aregenerative anemia, granulocytopenia, dysmyelopoiesis, and appearance of circulating blast cells; three of them died from acute myeloblastic leukemia. So a pure thrombocytopenia due to a platelet production defect, without any demonstrated functional platelet defect or morphologic dysmegakaryocytosis, may be a preleukemic syndrome. In the other 20 patients, with the same pure chronic thrombocytopenia, no malignant evolution has been seen with long follow-up delays, which is often also the case in pure refractory anemias. In the absence of objective criteria of a possible premalignant disorder, the classification of these cases is difficult, which it is also the case for the so-called refractory anemias. We suggest to individualize, in the classification of the myelodysplastic syndromes, a group of pure refractory thrombocytopenias. From a practical point of view such a diagnosis may be useful, at least to avoid inefficient and possibly harmful treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Histologic preparations from 149 gullets from chickens from the Linxian county (Henan province, northern China) having intraepithelial neoplasms or invasive carcinomas were reviewed. Invasive squamous cell carcinomas were found in 134 animals and invasive adenocarcinomas in seven. The remaining eight specimens had only intraepithelial neoplastic lesions: four with low-grade dysplasia and four with high-grade dysplasia (one with carcinoma in situ). The degree of differentiation in invading tumors was as follows: of the 134 invasive squamous carcinomas, two were highly differentiated, 125 moderately differentiated, and 22 poorly differentiated. All seven adenocarcinomas were moderately differentiated. In 97 of the 149 invasive carcinomas, intraepithelial neoplastic lesions were observed near the tumors: in 96 adjacent to invasive squamous carcinoma, and in one in the glandular epithelium adjacent to invasive adenocarcinoma. In the remaining 44, only invasive carcinoma was present. Epithelial buds bulging into the stroma were present in intraepithelial neoplastic lesions: in 71.8% in low-grade dysplasias adjacent to invasive carcinoma and in 94.4% in high-grade dysplasias adjacent to invasive carcinoma. Moreover, two of the four animals with low-grade dysplasia exclusively, and the four with high-grade dysplasia (one with carcinoma in situ) also had epithelial buds. In two specimens, invasive carcinoma was found to originate at the tip of the irregular buds with dysplasia. Similar histologic events have been found in chemically induced squamous esophageal carcinomas in rodents and in early squamous carcinoma in humans. It is therefore suggested that there is a close association between the degree of squamous cellular atypia, the formation of epithelial buds, and the progression toward invasive carcinoma in the esophagus.\r"

Six of these patients revealed no monoclonal proviral HTLV-I DNA in tumor cells. These six patients showed typical flower cells in peripheral blood; they comprised five cases of the smoldering type and one of lymphoma type. They showed a longer clinical course than ATLL patients with integrated proviral HTLV-I DNA. Five of the six patients were alive from 8 to 36 months after onset; the other patient died 9 months after onset. Histologically, they exhibited features of T-cell malignancy but with absence of the typical cerebriform giant cells that are usually present in ATLL. The tumor cells represented T-cell markers, usually CD4, but CD25 was negative. Rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene C beta was found in four of the six cases. On the basis of these results, cases of ATLL with no monoclonal proviral HTLV-I DNA should be clinicopathologically differentiated from those with integrated proviral DNA.\r"

The clinical features and pathologic spectrum of these lesions were studied in 20 cases (11 female and 9 male cases) with a mean age of 51 years at initial presentation. Malignant lymphomas of the large cell type were most frequently encountered (11/20). The next largest category was malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type (six of 20). Two thirds, 13 of 20 cases, had morphologic features suggestive of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Necrosis, an angiocentric growth pattern, and epitheliotropism were found in nine, eight, and three cases, respectively. Of ten cases immunophenotyped on fresh-frozen or fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, eight had a T-cell phenotype and two had a B-cell phenotype. Of 17 patients with sufficient follow-up data, ten are alive (median follow-up 33 months) and seven are dead (median survival 12 months). Patients with clinical Stages IE and IIE did not have a superior 5-year survival to those with more advanced disease. Histologic type also did not correlate with survival but this may be due to the aggressive histologic grade of the majority of cases and the retrospective nature of this study. The authors conclude that, despite the overall high-grade histologic type, the pathologic spectrum of malignant lymphomas involving this anatomic region is broad. Furthermore, some cases do not fit well into the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Formulation but more closely resemble the histologic features of peripheral T-cell lymphomas described in Japan.\r"

The intralymphoma variation observed by this method was insignificant for the reproducibility of classification. Five histologic types were defined: (1) follicular small cell (less than or equal to 25% large cells), (2) follicular large cell (greater than 25% large cells), (3) diffuse small (less than or equal to 10% large cells), (4) diffuse large cell (greater than 10% large cells), and (5) lymphoblastic (greater than 20% lymphoblasts).

The elevation of the enzyme activity correlated with the clinical stages and to the size of the primary tumors. Follow-up studies with various stages showed that the enzyme activity was useful in tracking the clinical course of disease after surgery. To evaluate the usefulness of this enzyme as a diagnostic marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and sialyl Lewis X-i antigen levels were also measured. The results indicate that alpha(1----3)-L-fucosyltransferase could be a more specific tumor marker than such tumor-associated antigens in lung cancer.\r"

In addition, in the patients with hepatic disease, PIVKA-II and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were compared. The PIVKA-II level was frequently high in patients with thrombotic disease given warfarin therapy and those with hepatocellular carcinoma. However, in patients with thrombotic disease who were not given warfarin therapy, no significant correlation was seen between the PIVKA-II value and the results of the thrombotest or hepaplastin test, suggesting no association between the PIVKA-II level and the degree of impairment of hepatic function. In 70 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the percentage of patients positive for PIVKA-II (greater than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml) and those positive for AFP (greater than or equal to 20 ng/ml) were similar (77% and 74%, respectively). Pearson's correlation of coefficient between the PIVKA-II value and the AFP value in the 70 patients was 0.463. However, false-positive rates in patients with hepatic disease other than hepatocellular carcinoma were lower for PIVKA-II. Combined assessment of PIVKA-II and AFP increased positive rates and allowed exclusion of false-positive patients. The plasma PIVKA-II level is suggested to be useful as an indicator of warfarin control in patients with thrombotic disease, as a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma, and is particularly of value when assessed in combination with AFP.\r"

Since glucocorticoids and arginase are potent immune suppressive agents, the increased level of GR and arginase in gastric cancer tissue suggest that these glucocorticoid-related factors in gastric cancer tissue may play a partial role in regulating cellular immunity.\r"

A panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was applied. All tumors were found to coexpress keratin and vimentin. A positive reaction for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was found in three tumors and a positive reaction for chromogranin was found in one tumor. On electron microscopic study, intracytoplasmic whorls of intermediate filaments were seen in the perinuclear area. Dense core \"neurosecretory\" granules were rarely seen. Intestinal pleomorphic carcinomas are histologically identical to pulmonary giant cell carcinomas. The prognosis is poor due to early tumor spread, with only a few months of postoperative survival. The pleomorphic carcinomas have some of the differentiation characteristics of carcinoid tumors and are best regarded as poorly differentiated variants of neuroendocrine carcinomas.\r"

The ERc levels were 88.2 +/- 8.9 (mean +/- SEM) and ERn were 94.4 +/- 15.6 fmol/mg protein; PRc levels were 197.9 +/- 25.9 and PRn 178.3 +/- 55.9 fmol/mg protein. The ERt levels were 162.6 +/- 23.2 and PRt 249.8 +/- 75.7 fmol/mg protein. The presence of PRc was related to the ERc levels according to the cut-off used. Estradiol receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) were present in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in 60.2% and 36.8% of cases, respectively. The simultaneous presence of both ERt and PRt was observed only in 27.9% of cases. In the normal endometrium ERc and PRc were negatively correlated (r = -0.525, P less than 0.005), whereas in endometrial adenocarcinoma the correlation was positive (r = 0.491, P less than 0.001). In contrast with the normal endometrium the correlation between ERc and ERn was positive (r = 0.582, P less than 0.001) in tumor tissue. In neoplastic tissue Scatchard analysis showed a single class of specific ERc sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.39 +/- 0.8 X 10(-9) mol/l, one tenth of that found in the normal premenopausal endometrium. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the receptor status showed that in 30% to 40% of cases studied the behavior of the neoplastic cell was similar to that found in the normal endometrial cell. In a 4-year follow-up of patients affected by endometrial adenocarcinoma there is better survival in the groups of patients with a simultaneous presence of ERt and PRt than in the group with their absence.\r"

The DNA ploidy level and proliferative patterns of each specimen were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). A GMS index, calculated as the ratio of G2 + M:S, was found to be significantly lower in control subjects than in any of the high-risk groups studied. Aneuploidy was more prevalent in rectal scrapings from cancer patients and adenoma patients than in those from control subjects. Aneuploid cell populations were detected in apparently normal rectal scrapings from two control subjects. Some high-risk individuals (i.e., cancer patients and patients with adenomas and a family history of cancer) exhibited higher proportions of tetraploid (designated G2/M) cells and a higher G2/M:S phase ratio than control subjects. The results accumulated thus far show that the rectal scraping procedure is safe and easy to perform. Our limited findings give hope that the DNA content analysis of cells obtained by rectal scraping may eventually prove useful in mass screening for colorectal cancer risk. However, definitive evaluation will require further refinement and elaboration of analytic technique and testing on more patients at various levels of predetermined risk.\r"

Neurologic complications occurred in 43 of 162 (26.5%) patients. Children with poorly differentiated sarcomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were more likely to have neurologic complications, which occurred in 39% of patients at risk. The types of complications seen included: metastatic spinal cord compression (11%); symptomatic peripheral neuropathy (10%); intracranial metastatic disease (7.5%); seizures (6%); and acute and chronic methotrexate-related neurologic dysfunction (2.5%). Spinal cord compression frequently occurred early in disease whereas brain metastases was almost always a late finding. Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy occurred primarily in children with rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. The advent of increasingly successful therapies for children with sarcoma and the frequency of severe neurologic complications indicate that a heightened level of surveillance for neurologic compromise is required.\r"

  ".W": "From November 1985 to August 1988, the National Study Group for Oesophageal Cancer collected and centralized data on 1926 new cases of oesophageal cancer in South Africa. A standard data sheet was used to record the age, sex, and condition of the patients, the site, length, and circumferential extent of the tumor, the presence of extraoesophageal and distant spread, associated pulmonary disease, and the therapeutic technique selected for each case. A computerized audit of cases was reviewed to examine the performance status, stage of disease, and methods of treatment. There were 1438 men and 488 women (male to female ratio, 3 to 1) and their ages ranged from 20 to 100 years (mean age, 56 years). Twenty-four percent were admitted to the hospital with total dysphagia. The performance status was excellent or good in 49% of the patients and fair in 29%. Those in poor or desperate condition included 13% of the patients with oesophago-airway fistulae. The most common site of cancer was the mid-thoracic oesophagus (53% of the cases), but 8.3% had tumors longer than 10 cm involving two or more oesophageal segments. Using the American Joint Committee (AJC) system of staging, 2.8% of the patients were assessed as Stage I, 19.8% as Stage II, and 77.4% as Stage III. Thirty-seven percent of the patients were treated by oesophageal intubation, 35% by radiation therapy, and 22% by chemotherapy. Surgery was selected for 17% of the patients. Although the number of young patients appears to have increased, the typical South African patient with oesophageal cancer is a man 56 years of age, in excellent or good condition, with a mid-thoracic tumor 6 cm in length and Stage III disease. This patient is frequently treated by palliative intubation of the oesophagus but may be a candidate for more intensive anti-cancer therapy.\r"

Wood work involves exposure to a variety of potential carcinogens, including wood dust itself, chemicals applied to the wood, and other carcinogenic agents that are associated with wood work. We report a series of case-control studies based on the New Zealand Cancer Registry. These studies involved 19,904 male patients registered with cancer from 1980 to 1984 who were 20 years of age or older at the time of registration. For each cancer site studied, the registrants for all other sites (except lung cancer) formed the control group. The following four cancer sites were found to be associated with wood work: lip, nasopharynx, lung, and liver. There was little evidence of increased risks for other cancer sites. Among wood workers, sawmillers experienced the highest risks for lung cancer (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 2.52) and liver cancer (odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 0.14). Carpenters showed increased risks for lip cancer (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.14) and lung cancer (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.54). The increased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer was strongest for foresters and loggers (odds ratio, 6.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 28.41).\r"

Barriers to use of screening, including cost, quality assurance, physician attitudes and practices, and women's knowledge, were addressed in communities across the United States. Early indications are that the program has made a major impact, contributing to the recent increase in the number of women who have had mammograms, the number of mammograms done in hospitals, the number of physicians who follow Society Guidelines for Mammography 0 (in Illinois, this rose from 15% in 1985 to 46% in 1987), and in the number of early breast cancers being diagnosed. The challenge remains to more broadly integrate breast cancer detection into health practice. The BCDA provides a valuable example to make this goal a reality.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced in patients, (n = 15), for elective coronary artery-bypass surgery with 0.12 mg.kg-1 midazolam IV, followed by 1 mg.kg-1 ketamine and 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil IV eight minutes later. Subsequently, pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Three minutes later, the trachea was intubated, and ketamine 1 mg.kg-1.hr-1 IV infusion was started. Incremental doses of 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil were given whenever a greater than 15 per cent increase in rate-pressure product was observed. The mean +/- S.E.M. dose of sufentanil before cardiopulmonary bypass was 6.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms.kg and 9.1 +/- 0.9 micrograms.kg for the entire procedure. Although midazolam alone caused reductions in systolic BP, SVR and LVSWI, other haemodynamic variables were not altered. The administration of this anaesthetic technique caused no clinically important adverse haemodynamic changes and/or ST-segment changes and prevented the adverse haemodynamic changes caused by intubation, skin incision, sternotomy and periaortic dissection. Adequate analgesia, complete amnesia and early recovery of wakefulness were observed.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of three different techniques of transtracheal ventilation to reverse hypoxia and provide pulmonary ventilation were examined. Five swine were anaesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen, their tracheas were intubated, and their lungs mechanically ventilated to produce a PaCO2 of 35-40 mmHg. A 14-gauge catheter was inserted percutaneously into the trachea caudad to the tip of the tracheal tube. The animals were then left apnoeic until their oxygen saturation fell to 60 per cent. At this point, attempts were made to ventilate and oxygenate the animals through the tracheal catheter with one of three systems (Jet--50 psi [2585 mmHg] driving pressure controlled with a thumb operated valve, Flush-fresh gas outlet of an anaesthetic machine with flow controlled by the flush button, or Circle--standard anaesthesia circle system with pressures greater than 60 mmHg). Arterial blood gas determinations were made every minute for five minutes after beginning transtracheal ventilation. Both the Jet and Flush modes resulted in a mean PaO2 greater than 250 mmHg within one minute of their initiation whereas the PaO2 with the Circle system never exceeded 180 mmHg even at five minutes. The Flush and Jet modes produced a decrease in the PaCO2 (from 80 mmHg to 35-45 mmHg) over the five minutes. In contrast, it was not possible to provide adequate ventilation with the Circle system as evidence by an increasing PaCO2 (from 80 mmHg to less than 110 mmHg at five minutes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following MAC determination with halothane alone, epidural morphine was administered and MAC was redetermined. Epidural morphine significantly reduced, P less than 0.001, the MAC of halothane for fore and hind legs in both volume groups; from 1.04 +/- 0.038 to 0.68 +/- 0.034 and 0.60 +/- 0.017 for for and hind limbs, respectively, in the large volume group, and from 0.96 +/- 0.038 to 0.66 +/- 0.088 and 0.60 +/- 0.030 for fore and hind limbs, respectively, in the small volume group. The reduction in MAC was significantly greater, P less than 0.025, in the hind limb. This study indicates that epidural morphine reduces the halothane requirements in the dog in a segmental manner. The volume of administration was not shown to be critical. Epidural morphine, 0.1 mg.kg-1, diluted in 0.13 to 0.26 ml.kg-1 saline produces significant analgesia in the dog as far forward as the fore limb and will reduce the halothane requirement to permit surgery.\r"

Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels of the patients suggested that surgical stress was minimal in both groups. It is likely that droperidol and fentanyl, both used in neuroleptanaesthesia, were responsible for the hyperprolactinaemia which was followed by inhibition of progesterone production. These agents, therefore, are not recommended as anaesthetic agents for transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte pick-up.\r"

The VEP was recorded before and at 1 and 2 min after induction of anaesthesia with 5-6 mg.kg-1 of thiopentone. After recording the 1 and 2 min VEPs, anaesthesia was maintained with a fentanyl-nitrous oxide-oxygen combination, and further recordings were made at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after induction. The 1 and 2 min VEPs showed a marked decrease in the amplitudes. Latencies were increased. The amplitudes gradually returned to the control level at 15 min, while the latencies remained increased throughout the study period. In conclusion, thiopentone should be avoided during the critical period of VEP recording. Once it is given, at least 15 min should elapse before an appropriate interpretation of the VEP can be made. Thiopentone-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anaesthesia slightly increases the latencies of the VEP. These effects should be considered in the interpretation of the VEP when thiopentone-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anaesthesia is used.\r"

  ".W": "The neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of mivacurium chloride were studied during nitrous oxide-oxygen narcotic (fentanyl) (n = 90) and nitrous oxide-oxygen isoflurane (ISO) anaesthesia (n = 45). In addition, a separate group (n = 9) received succinylcholine during fentanyl anaesthesia to compare its neuromuscular effects with mivacurium. Mivacurium was initially administered as a single bolus in doses from 0.03 mg.kg-1 to 0.25 mg.kg-1 to study the dose-response relationships, as well as the cardiovascular effects of mivacurium. Neuromuscular block (NMB) was measured by recording the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation (0.15 Hz, 0.2 ms supramaximal voltage). The ED95 values for mivacurium were estimated to be 0.073 mg.kg-1 and 0.053 mg.kg-1 in the fentanyl and ISO groups respectively. The duration of block (time from injection to 95 per cent recovery) for a dose of 0.05 mg.kg-1 mivacurium was 15.3 +/- 1.0 min and 21.5 +/- 1.3 min for fentanyl and ISO anaesthesia, respectively. The recovery index (25-75 per cent) between initial bolus dose (6.1 +/- 0.5 min), repeat bolus doses (7.6 +/- 0.6 min), mivacurium infusion (6.7 +/- 0.7 min) and succinylcholine infusion (6.8 +/- 1.8 min) were not significantly different. There was minimal change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR) following bolus doses of mivacurium up to 0.15 mg.kg-1. Bolus administration of 0.20 mg.kg-1 or 0.25 mg.kg-1 of mivacurium decreased MAP from 78.2 +/- 2.5 to 64.0 +/- 3.2 mmHg (range 12-59 per cent of control) (P less than 0.05). The same doses when administered slowly over 30 sec produced minimal change in MAP or HR.\r"

Rectal pH was 9.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD, range 7.2 to 12.1) and was independent of sex, age and nutrition. This wide range of rectal pH values offers a possible explanation for the widely scattered bioavailability of drugs administered by the rectal route. Mean rectal pH was considerably higher than that reported for adults; this unexpected alkalinity should be taken into account, when drug formulations are considered for rectal administration in children.\r"

The anaesthetic record was examined to determine the frequency of epidural catheter insertion and any problems related to this procedure. Nine epidural insertions were attempted in the 16 patients identified. Five were uncomplicated but four were complicated by one or more of: failure to identify the epidural space, blood vessel trauma, dural puncture, failure to obtain analgesia or the need for multiple attempts before successful insertion. There were no sequelae related to epidural insertion. There were no sequelae related to epidural insertion. We conclude that patients with HRI may be offered epidural anaesthesia for labour and delivery provided that they are informed of the increased risk of complications.\r"

A syringe barrel of similar size, fixed at right angles to the sensor, forms a handle for the fist. The sensor is linked to a pressure transducer with non-compliant tubing. Pressure output of the saline-filled system was found to be linearly related to the force exerted on each size of the sensor. In 20 children, aged two to eight years, the device, fitted in turn with the 5, 10 and 20 ml syringe seal sensors, gave train-of-four (TOF) ratios which showed close correlation (coefficient r = 0.96, 0.93, 0.95) and agreement (regression slope b = 0.97, 0.95, 0.98) with those of a force transducer. Thus, inspection of the displayed TOF pressure pulses gives a rapid and reliable estimate of neuromuscular blockade.\r"

The workstyles included part-time arrangements, limited calls by some individuals, and calls restricted to certain anaesthetists with specific areas of expertise. Rules were defined to limit the proximity of late calls to avoid fatigue and computer software was developed. For each scheduling period, the program assists in making daily call assignments based on each anaesthetist's availability and a priority ranking system. It is flexible enough to allow personal preferences. The number and distribution of all calls scheduled are counted. When the assignments are completed, differences are reconciled. For two years, this program has proved superior to previous manual systems for scheduling this group of anaesthetists with variable workstyles.\r"

  ".W": "Dextran in lactated Ringer's solution (20 ml/kg) was infused for 1 hour into anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy (deafferentation; n = 10) and dogs treated with hexamethonium (de-efferentation; n = 13) to compare with our previous observation in dogs with an intact autonomic nervous system (control, n = 34). During the infusion, increase in blood pressure associated with increase in cardiac output was observed in all three groups. The increases in blood pressure were larger in the two groups with an impaired autonomic nervous system. In the recovery period, the control dogs and the hexamethonium-treated dogs showed gradual increases in total peripheral resistance and in vasoconstricted hypertension 3 hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, the dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy did not show any increase in total peripheral resistance. The vasoconstricted groups showed peaks of natriuresis soon after the infusion, not 3 hours after the infusion when vasoconstriction was observed, although the dogs with deafferentation did not show a significant increase in natriuresis. Norepinephrine (0.5 micrograms/kg) was administered intravenously before and after volume expansion, and the pressor responses in the three groups after volume expansion were enhanced similarly (143%, 128%, and 136%, respectively). These results indicate that the afferent signals from peripheral vessels to the brain contribute to the production of vasoconstricted hypertension after acute volume expansion and that the vasoconstriction is independent of pressor hypersensitivity and is dissociated in time from the natriuresis.\r"

In the kidney, hypertension is associated with a compensatory shift in the autoregulatory response to pressure. To directly determine the effects of established hypertension on the renal microvascular response to changes of perfusion pressure, we evaluated pressure-induced vasoconstriction in hydronephrotic kidneys isolated from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Vessel diameters of interlobular arteries (ILAs) and afferent and efferent arterioles were determined by computer-assisted videomicroscopy during alterations in renal arterial pressure (RAP) from 80 to 180 mm Hg. Increased RAP induced a pressure-dependent vasoconstriction in preglomerular vessels (afferent arterioles and ILAs), but not in postglomerular vessels (efferent arterioles). The calcium antagonist nifedipine prevented pressure-induced afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction with a similar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) (WKY, 63 +/- 27 vs. SHR, 60 +/- 32 nM). The pressure-activation curves for ILAs in SHR and WKY were similar. In contrast, the pressure-activation curve for afferent arterioles in SHR kidneys exhibited a rightward shift, which was observed at every segment of the afferent arteriole (i.e., near ILA, at midportion, and near glomerulus). These findings demonstrate that the ILA and the afferent arteriole both possess the ability to constrict in response to increased pressure, whereas this property is lacking in the efferent arteriole. Hypertension was associated with a compensatory shift in the pressure response of the afferent arteriole, such that higher RAPs were required to elicit vasoconstriction in this vessel.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic drug effects on maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax) are frequency dependent, which implies that the effects of these drugs on conduction should also be rate dependent. Previous in vivo studies have been limited by assumptions about unchanging propagation pathway, and by the empirical use of a first-order recovery model. To explore time-dependent antiarrhythmic drug-induced conduction slowing in vivo, we used 56-electrode epicardial mapping in chloralose-anesthetized dogs with formalin-induced atrioventricular block. Interval-dependent changes in conduction time were assessed under control conditions and then after three loading and maintenance infusions of procainamide. Under control conditions, epicardial activation time (86 +/- 26 msec at a basic cycle length of 300 msec) was unchanged (87 +/- 24 msec) by pauses up to 6.6 +/- 2.2 seconds. Procainamide caused conduction slowing that dissipated as a function of recovery interval, with 94 +/- 6% recovery over a maximum pause of 6.7 +/- 1.5 seconds, but did not alter activation pattern. Drug-induced changes in conduction were evaluated by use of a mathematical model assuming phase 0 inward current proportional to conduction velocity squared. Conduction changes were better fitted by this \"quadratic model\" (least sum of squared deviations 3.9 x 10(-3) by mapping in five dogs, 2.7 x 10(-2) by use of QRS duration in nine dogs) than by a monoexponential model (sum of squared deviations 5.7 x 10(-3) by mapping, 3.4 x 10(-2) with QRS; p less than 0.01 vs. quadratic model for each). As predicted by theoretical analysis, recovery time constants from the quadratic model were similar to time constants for procainamide-induced changes in Vmax in vitro, and significantly longer than values obtained with a monoexponential model. Drug-induced changes in QRS duration were highly correlated with simultaneous changes measured by epicardial mapping (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001), indicating that QRS duration is a valid index of drug effects on ventricular conduction. We concluded that procainamide causes interval-dependent changes in ventricular conduction in vivo that are consistent with a proportional relation between phase 0 inward current and the square of conduction velocity. These observations have important potential implications for the dose-dependent and heart rate-dependent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

Because of differences between the life spans of Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, the functional characteristics of relaxation were investigated to evaluate the possibility of a differential age-associated response in these two strains of animals. The kinetic performance of the diastolic phase of myocardial contraction was measured by assessing the relative time during which load bearing occurred in a series of afterloaded isotonic twitches. This measurement was expressed as the ratio of the duration of afterloaded isotonic shortening and relengthening to the time required for isometric force to decline to the same level during isometric relaxation. A ratio of less than unity identified a load-dependent state whereas a value greater than one reflected a load-independent condition. Results showed that the right myocardium was completely load independent whereas the left myocardium was fully load dependent at all physiological afterloads. Aging reduced the load independence of the right ventricle and the load dependence of the left ventricle in Fischer rats. In contrast, no aging effect on the properties of afterloaded isotonic relaxation was seen in Sprague-Dawley rats. In conclusion, distinct differences exist in the mechanical dynamics of inactivation between the left and right ventricular myocardium. Aging reduced these variations in Fischer rats but had no apparent influence in Sprague-Dawley animals up to 20 months after birth.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine, an intermediate product in the metabolism of ATP, is thought to produce vasodilation in all vascular beds with the exception of the kidney. Due to its theoretical potential as a pulmonary vasodilator, we studied the hemodynamic effects of adenosine in the pulmonary vasculature of chronically instrumented awake sheep. Adenosine produced significant pulmonary vasoconstriction instead of the expected vasodilatation. Bolus injections of adenosine into the superior vena cava produced a dose-dependent increase in pulmonary artery pressure that was entirely due to an increase in vascular resistance, since cardiac output decreased slightly. This effect is produced via activation of specific cell surface adenosine receptors, since it was blocked by the adenosine-receptor antagonists theophylline and dipropylsulfophenylxanthine. The cell type involved in adenosine-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction appears to be located within the lung, since vasoconstriction was blunted when adenosine was infused into the left atrium, distal to the lung. However, adenosine does not directly vasoconstrict the pulmonary vasculature, because its effect could be completely abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibition with either indomethacin or ibuprofen and by a thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide-receptor antagonist (SQ 29,548). Adenosine-induced vasoconstriction was also greatly reduced after inhibition of thromboxane synthesis. Thus, adenosine produced pulmonary vasoconstriction through generation of a thromboxane/endoperoxide product. Whether endogenous adenosine is involved in the generation of pulmonary vasoconstriction seen in pathophysiological states remains to be determined. To our knowledge, this is the first clear evidence for adenosine-induced vasoconstriction outside the kidney and for an interaction between adenosine and eicosanoid mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve traffic is impaired in heart failure. We recorded renal nerve activity during changes in arterial pressure while simultaneously recording from aortic baroreceptor afferent fibers in 10 dogs with heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing and in 10 sham animals. Sensitivity of the aortic baroreceptors (percent change in nerve activity per millimeters mercury change in mean arterial pressure) was reduced in the heart failure group (heart failure, 2.3 +/- 0.3; sham, 3.6 +/- 0.4, p = 0.02). Despite the reduced sensitivity of aortic baroreceptors in heart failure, there was no difference in the baroreflex gain of renal nerve activity (heart failure, -5.5 +/- 1.4; sham, -5.8 +/- 1.3, p = NS). These values tended to decrease in both groups after vagotomy. The relation between baroreceptor input and renal sympathetic output, or central baroreflex gain (percent change in renal nerve activity divided by percent change in aortic nerve activity) was similar in both groups before vagotomy (heart failure, -2.4 +/- 0.6; sham, -2.3 +/- 0.5, p = NS). Vagotomy reduced central gain in the sham group (-0.9 +/- 0.1, p = 0.03) but not in the heart failure group (-1.7 +/- 0.5, p = NS), suggesting that the contribution of vagal afferents in the baroreflex arc is reduced in heart failure. Baroreflex control of R-R interval was attenuated in heart failure when assessed by blood pressure elevation but not reduction, indicating abnormal parasympathetic but preserved cardiac sympathetic mechanisms in heart failure. Thus, dogs with heart failure exhibit reduced sensitivity of aortic baroreceptors but preserved baroreflex control of renal nerve activity. Reduced baroreceptor sensitivity with preservation of baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity may contribute to the sympathoexcitatory state known to exist in heart failure.\r"

We sought to determine if NPY inhibited the vagal effects on atrioventricular (AV) interval and atrial contraction in a manner similar to its inhibition of the vagal effects on cycle length. In 19 anesthetized dogs we measured the vagal effects on cycle length, AV interval, and atrial contraction before and after 3-minute trains of sympathetic stimulation or before and after exogenous NPY (20 micrograms/kg i.v.). Three minutes after 10-Hz sympathetic stimulation, the vagal effects on cycle length and AV interval were attenuated by 52 +/- 9% and 63 +/- 8%, respectively. Phentolamine significantly augmented this attenuation, but propranolol had no appreciable effect. In the control group of animals or in the group that received phentolamine, the vagal effects on atrial contraction measured before and after sympathetic stimulation were not significantly different. In these two groups, however, the basal atrial contraction was reduced substantially after the cessation of sympathetic stimulation. Propranolol prevented this reduction in atrial contraction. After propranolol, the vagal effects on atrial contraction 3 minutes after sympathetic stimulation were attenuated by 31 +/- 6%. Exogenous NPY had no direct effect on cycle length, AV interval, or atrial contraction, but exogenous NPY did persistently inhibit the vagal effects on each of these cardiac processes. Three minutes after NPY was given, the vagal effects on cycle length, AV interval, and atrial contraction were inhibited by 62 +/- 7%, 69 +/- 5%, and 68 +/- 5%, respectively. We conclude that NPY attenuates the vagal effects on the atrial myocardium and on the sinus and AV nodes. In the absence of beta-blockade, the inhibitory effect of neurally released NPY on the vagally induced decreases in atrial contraction may be masked by the reduction in the atrial contraction that occurs after sympathetic stimulation.\r"

These include sympathetically aneural heart, parasympathetically aneural heart, and heart with cholinergic innervation reconstituted from the nodose placodes. The neural status of these hearts has been assessed by a variety of morphological and biochemical methods, but the functional status of innervation is not known. In the present study, we have used electrocardiography and field stimulation to determine the functional neural status of the three different innervation models. The RR and QTc intervals were measured to assess the dominant autonomic tone and autonomic dysfunction in the heart. Even though the RR and QTc intervals were found to be identical in sham and experimental embryos, field stimulation of superfused atria showed that the sympathetically aneural heart has functional cholinergic innervation but lacks any sympathetic response. Hearts from embryos which were parasympathetically aneural lacked a cholinergic response to field stimulation and were judged to be functionally parasympathetically aneural. Hearts with cholinergic ganglia reconstituted from the nodose placodes have normal RR and QTc intervals as well as a normal cholinergic response to field stimulation. The results indicate that these neurons are functionally indistinguishable from neural crest-derived neurons.\r"

Seven normal dogs served as controls. Subendocardial and subepicardial segment lengths were measured by ultrasonic dimension gauges, and myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. Atrial pacing (180-200 beats/min for 5 minutes) was used to produce a chronotropic stress. In dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy, the subendocardial blood flow failed to increase during pacing compared with the baseline state (1.21 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.17 ml/min/g). Subendocardial shortening fraction deteriorated with pacing stress (before pacing, 30.6 +/- 3.9%; after pacing, 24.2 +/- 3.7%; p less than 0.001). In controls, subendocardial blood flow increased from 1.32 +/- 0.19 to 1.80 +/- 0.19 ml/min/g during pacing, and shortening fraction was preserved (before pacing, 25.5 +/- 3.9%; after pacing, 25.9 +/- 3.3%).

However, in baboons it has been reported that intracoronary acetylcholine results in a fall in coronary blood flow and that stimulation of the vagi is without effect. The dose response of intracoronary acetylcholine and the effect of efferent vagal stimulation on the coronary circulation were reinvestigated in closed-chest, anesthetized dogs and baboons. The left main coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at constant pressure. alpha-Adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors were pharmacologically blocked with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Heart rate was held constant by right ventricular pacing. In dogs, intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (1-300 micrograms/min) elicited a dose-dependent increase in steady-state coronary blood flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension, without a change in myocardial oxygen consumption. Vagal stimulation caused a coronary vasodilation that was attenuated by a metabolically mediated decrease in flow. In baboons, acetylcholine increased steady-state coronary blood flow in the dose range of 1-10 micrograms/min, caused little change at 30 micrograms/min, and decreased flow at 100-300 micrograms/min. Coronary sinus oxygen tension increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 10 micrograms/min. Myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged in the dose range of 1-10 micrograms/min and declined between 30 and 300 micrograms/min. Efferent stimulation of the vagi resulted in coronary dilation obscured by a metabolic reduction of flow. It is concluded that 1) low doses of acetylcholine elicit a primary coronary vasodilation in both species, but in baboons high doses of acetylcholine cause a reduction of both myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow below control values and 2) vagal stimulation causes a competition between coronary vasodilation and metabolic reduction of flow in dogs and baboons.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of isolated cardiac myocytes have generated the need for detailed information about regional electrophysiological differences in the atrium. We measured the spatial distribution of action potentials in adult and newborn canine right atria. Multiple regional differences in action potential shape and duration were found. The multiple regional differences produced an overall simple pattern: the longest action potentials occurred in the area of the sinus node, and the action potential duration decreased with increasing distance from the sinus node area. To account for the overall pattern, we tested factors considered important in causing atrial action potential shape differences (e.g., electronic interactions). None of the factors tested accounted for the regional differences. We then found regional differences in the responses to pauses, which suggested that differences in the properties of individual cells accounted for the regional repolarization differences. If so, genetic regulation of the regional differences may produce the overall pattern on a developmental basis. Experiments in newborn atria showed that only in the upper crista was the spatial pattern similar to that of the adult; there was little variability in action potential shape and duration in the other areas. As a further test for associated regional differences in cell properties, we examined for differences in the isoform expression of troponin T (TnT1, TnT2, TnT3, and TnT4), a protein important in excitation-contraction coupling. In adults, the greatest proportion of TnT1 occurred in the area of the sinus node, and its proportion decreased with increasing distance from the sinus node area in association with a relative increase in the proportion of TnT2. In newborn atria the relative amount of TnT1 was greatest in the upper crista (similar to adult), but little difference was found in the distribution of the isoforms in the other regions. The correspondence between the regional differences in repolarization and in the expression of the troponin T isoforms in adult and newborn atria suggests that 1) cellular ionic mechanisms vary regionally to coordinate differences in action potential configuration with differences in cell properties that regulate contractility and 2) genetic expression of the systems that regulate repolarization and mechanical cellular properties are under similar developmental and regional control.\r"

Measurement of multidimensional refractory periods demonstrated an anisotropic distribution within large bundles with the longest refractory periods in the medial upper crista terminalis (sinus node area), a distribution similar to that of action potential durations. Also, discontinuities of repolarization were found at muscle bundle junctions. Early premature impulses originating in the sinus node area propagated throughout the right atrial preparations without conduction disturbances or reentry. Conversely, early premature impulses that originated at sites distal to the sinus node area resulted in localized conduction block at multiple sites, which frequently produced complex conduction changes and reentry. The critical nature of the site of origin of a premature impulse in initiating reentry was related to locations where the steepest repolarization gradients occurred: within anisotropic bundles in the direction of highest axial resistance (across fibers) and at muscle bundle junctions that represented localized discontinuities of axial resistance. The multiple conduction abnormalities at localized sites interacted to produce different types of reentry at a larger size scale (25 mm2 to several cm2). In each case, neither repolarization inhomogeneities (leading circle concept) nor anisotropic discontinuous propagation was the only \"mechanism\" involved. That is, reentry at a macroscopic size scale occurred as a result of a combined repolarization-anisotropic discontinuous propagation mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances adenosine-induced coronary vasodilation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity exerts beneficial effects on myocardial ischemia through augmentation of vasodilatory effects of released adenosine. In open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the carotid artery. Propranolol was infused into the bypass tube to exclude the metabolic effects of norepinephrine. When clonidine (0.24 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) was infused for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow by partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow was increased by 43% from 27 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min despite no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (38 +/- 5 mm Hg) and a slight decrease in adenosine release. Both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were significantly improved (fractional shortening, 1.8 +/- 1.0 to 10.9 +/- 1.5%, p less than 0.001; lactate extraction ratio, -57.8 +/- 6.5 to -31.9 +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.005). Identical results were observed in the denervated hearts, indicating that the beneficial effect of clonidine is not attributed to the prevention of norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals. The beneficial effects of clonidine were prevented by yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent. An adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, also prevented the beneficial effects of clonidine, indicating that these beneficial effects are mediated by effects of adenosine. Furthermore, the extent of augmentation of coronary flow in the ischemic heart was coincided with that of augmentation of exogenous adenosine-induced hyperemic flow (40%) by clonidine. Production of cyclic AMP in the coronary artery during myocardial ischemia was augmented by clonidine. In 12 other dogs, myocardial ischemia was produced by intracoronary embolization of microspheres (15 microns in diameter). Clonidine enhanced (39%) the hyperemic coronary flow and improved both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio. Thus, we conclude that alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation can ameliorate myocardial ischemia mainly due to enhancement of vasodilatory effects of adenosine released from the ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "A number of genetic disorders in humans are associated with defects in the synthesis and metabolism of collagen, which are accompanied by multiple cardiovascular disease processes. To determine whether genetically determined cross-linking abnormalities of collagen may alter cardiac function, left ventricular papillary muscles of mice with a genetic defect in the cross-linking of collagen (Movbr) were studied in vitro. With respect to controls, increases in time to peak tension, from 102 +/- 1.4 to 125 +/- 5.4 msec (p less than 0.001), and time to one-half relaxation, from 76 +/- 3.0 to 98 +/- 6.1 msec (p less than 0.05), were measured. Moreover, resting tension at the length associated with maximum developed isometric force (L) was elevated, from 11.1 +/- 1.7 to 19.3 +/- 1.1 mN/mm2 (p less than 0.001), and a similar difference was also seen throughout the physiological range of muscle lengths. In contrast, developed tension was depressed at 93-97% of L. Peak rate of tension rise and decay were diminished whereas time to peak rate of tension rise was prolonged. Isotonically, a decrease in the magnitude of peak shortening at L, from 4.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.0 +/- 0.2% (p less than 0.04), and an increase in time to peak shortening, from 100 +/- 2.3 to 129 +/- 2.8 msec (p less than 0.001), were seen. In addition, peak velocities of shortening and relengthening were diminished in the Movbr mouse heart. In conclusion, the impairment in collagen cross-linking alters cardiac mechanics by a reduction in force-generating ability and a prolongation of the timing parameters of the systolic and diastolic phases of contraction in vitro.\r"

We described the hemodynamics of the chick embryo from stage 12 (50 hours of a 21-day incubation) to stage 29 (6 days), during which the embryo weight increased 120-fold. We measured ventricular, embryo and extraembryonic vascular bed wet weights, dorsal aortic blood flow with a directional pulsed-Doppler velocity meter, and ventricular and vitelline arterial blood pressures with a servo-null micropressure system. The data are reported as mean +/- SEM. With rapid development and morphogenesis, dorsal aortic blood flow increased from 0.015 +/- 0.004 to 2.40 +/- 0.20 mm3/sec parallel to the geometric increase of wet embryo weight from 2.22 +/- 0.10 to 267.5 +/- 9.7 mg. Dorsal aortic blood flow normalized for embryo and extraembryonic weight remained relatively constant (Y = 2.13 + 0.02X, r = 0.23, SEE = 0.03). Stroke volume increased from 0.01 +/- 0.003 to 0.69 +/- 0.03 mm3, and heart rate doubled from 103 +/- 2 to 208 +/- 5 beats/min. Systolic, diastolic, and mean vitelline arterial pressure increased linearly from 0.32 +/- 0.01, 0.23 +/- 0.01, and 0.28 +/- 0.01 mm Hg at stage 12 to 2.00 +/- 0.06, 1.22 +/- 0.03, and 1.51 +/- 0.04 mm Hg, respectively, at stage 29. Ventricular peak systolic and end-diastolic pressure increased from 0.95 +/- 0.04 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 at stage 12 to 3.45 +/- 0.10 and 0.82 +/- 0.03 at stage 29, respectively. The hemodynamic waveforms were similar to those found in the four-chamber heart of the mature animal. These data are integral to understanding the interrelation of function and form during cardiac development.\r"

The increase in [Cai2+] after stimulation with thrombin, collagen, and platelet-activating factor were also greater in stroke patients, but the profiles of these [Cai2+] changes were parallel to control. Cross incubation of control platelets with plasma from stroke patients resulted in raised basal [Cai2+] and caused the release of serotonin from platelets. These results indicate that the higher platelet basal [Cai2+] in stroke patients represents a lowered threshold for activation and that this may be due to a plasmatic factor rather than a primary platelet defect.\r"

  ".W": "This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction limits blood flow to hypoperfused regions of myocardium during exercise. The vasoconstrictor influence of alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes was assessed by use of selective adrenergic blocking agents. Dogs chronically instrumented with a circumflex coronary artery hydraulic occluder and an intra-arterial catheter underwent treadmill exercise in the presence of a coronary stenosis that decreased distal perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg. Myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres (15 microns) before and during selective alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by intracoronary infusion of prazosin (1 microgram/kg/min x 10 min) or idazoxan (1 microgram/kg/min x 10 min), respectively. Coronary perfusion pressure was held equal before and during receptor blockade with the hydraulic occluder. Compared with control exercise, subendocardial blood flow increased during alpha 1-receptor blockade with prazosin from 0.60 +/- 0.14 to 1.12 +/- 0.17 ml/min/g (p less than 0.05), and mean transmural flow increased from 1.07 +/- 0.19 to 1.60 +/- 0.22 ml/min/g (p less than 0.05). In contrast, subendocardial and mean transmural blood flow were not different from control during selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blockade with idazoxan (0.48 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g, p = 0.33, and 0.82 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.20 ml/min/g, p = 0.45, respectively). These data indicate that even in the presence of a coronary stenosis that causes substantial myocardial underperfusion during exercise, residual coronary vasoconstrictor tone is present in ischemic myocardium, and this vasoconstriction is mediated predominantly by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The maximum amplitude of vector loops formed by summing orthogonally recorded bipolar electrograms has been shown to reflect the direction of activation in cardiac muscle. To investigate whether components of vector loops could provide information about different activation directions in local areas of myocardium, we correlated \"instantaneous vectors\" with isochronal activation patterns in an in vitro preparation of experimental myocardial infarction. In thirteen 3 mm x 3 mm regions studied (from 11 tissues), at least 16 microelectrode impalements with a minimum density of 0.8 mm between sites were made. In seven situations in which notched, irregular, and prolonged duration electrograms were present, vector loops pointed in the same general direction throughout their entire time course. In these preparations, microelectrode impalements demonstrated only a single major direction of activation. In five of six areas in which multidirectional vector loops were present, two or more separate local directions of activation corresponded to the directions of the vector loop. Instantaneous vectors were then used to analyze propagation patterns in vivo in 10 animals with 2-4-week-old experimental myocardial infarction. Of 150 sites in the 10 animals, 13% contained more than one major local direction of activation. In 11 markedly abnormal sites, electrograms were recorded during pacing from four sites around the recording probe. When comparing electrogram characteristics from the four sites, a mean difference of 5.9 mV in electrogram amplitude and 19.1 msec in electrogram duration (coefficient of variation, 27% for amplitude and 22% for duration) was found. In only two of the 11 sites was it found that the same number of activation directions occurred from all pacing sites. We conclude: 1) Instantaneous components of vector loops accurately represent local directions of cardiac activation at differing times. 2) Most areas of experimental myocardial infarction have only one major direction of activation despite the presence of abnormal electrograms. 3) In some regions, however, two major local directions of activation can be identified within a relatively local area. 4) Geometric activation patterns in experimental myocardial infarction are markedly dependent on initial activation direction.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular studies in humans have advanced the concept that, during orthostatic stress, cardiopulmonary afferents reflexly regulate vascular resistance in the forearm but exert surprisingly little if any effects on vascular resistance in the calf. In contrast, neurophysiological studies have indicated that unloading of cardiopulmonary afferents during lower body negative pressure evokes comparable increases in sympathetic outflow to the muscles of both the forearm and the calf. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine if alterations in central venous pressure over the physiological range trigger reflex changes in muscle sympathetic outflow that not only are statistically significant but also are large enough to alter vascular resistance in the calf. To accomplish this aim, we measured calf blood flow with plethysmography and simultaneously performed microelectrode recordings of sympathetic outflow to calf muscles in conscious humans during maneuvers designed to alter the loading conditions of the cardiopulmonary afferents. We found that calf vascular resistance increased by 33 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) during decreases in central venous pressure produced by nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and decreased by 26 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) during increases in central venous pressure produced by nonhypertensive infusion of normal saline. These changes in calf resistance were at least as large as the changes in forearm resistance evoked by these maneuvers and were accompanied by parallel changes in peroneal muscle sympathetic nerve activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Outward membrane currents were characterized in single coronary smooth muscle cells of adult beagle dogs. The cells averaged 96.4 x 7.1 microns and had a resting potential of -50.7 mV, an input resistance of 307.9 M omega, a capacitance of 32.3 pF, and a calculated membrane surface area of 4,037 microns2. The cells contracted in response to external application of acetylcholine or high K+. In voltage clamp by use of the suction pipette method, outward current began to appear at -50 mV and reached 15.2 nA at 50 mV with a current density of 376.5 microA/cm2. The current was reduced by external tetraethylammonium, Ba2+, and internal Cs+, and its reversal potential had a Nernst relation to external K+ concentration. Elevation of external Ca2+ (Ca2+o) from 0 to 0.3 mM increased total K+ current by up to 300%; elevation of internal Ca2+ (Ca2+i) to 5 x 10(-7) M by internal perfusion increased total outward current to a similar extent, suggesting a large difference in Ca2+ transmembrane sensitivity. Total whole-cell K+ current consisted of two components: an initial time-independent current (Ii) followed by a time-dependent current (It). Ii and It were through separate K+ channels based on differences in a) sensitivity to Ca2+09b) modulation by an inward Ca2+ current, c) current amplitudes and activation kinetics, and d) responses to pharmacological agents. It was the largest component, measuring 4.5 nA in 0 mM Ca2+o but increasing to 11.9 nA in 0.3 mM Ca2+o with a steep 2.5 power function. It activated with a biexponential time course; in Ca2+o-free solution, its time course was relatively insensitive to voltage changes but became voltage sensitive in the presence of Ca2+o. Further, such sensitivity was abolished or enhanced by Co2+ or Bay K 8644, respectively. We concluded that there are two types of Ca2+-sensitive K+ currents, Ii and It, in coronary smooth muscle cells. Via an inward Ca2+ channel Ca2+o strongly modulates It, both in amplitude and kinetics.\r"

  ".W": "Whole-cell Ca2+ channel currents were recorded from isolated single canine Purkinje and ventricular cells to determine whether there were multiple types of Ca2+ channels in these two cell types, as in many other excitable tissues. The experimental conditions were such that currents other than Ca2+ channel currents were largely suppressed. The charge carrier was either Ca2+ or Ba2+ (5mM). In every canine Purkinje cell studied (n = 36), we saw T and L Ca2+ channel currents that are similar to their counterparts in other tissues. Neither current was affected by tetrodotoxin (30 microM), but both were reduced by Mn2+ (5mM). Ni2+ (50 microM) blocked T more than L current. Nisoldipine (1 microM) apparently abolished the L current but also decreased the T current by 50%. Substitution of Ba2+ for Ca2+ augmented and prolonged L current but did not affect T current significantly. At 36 degrees C and with 5 mM [Ca2+]o, T current inactivated over a voltage range from -70 to -30 mV whereas L current inactivated between -30 and +20 mV. T current was detectable in only some of the ventricular cells studied (8 out of 12). In these cells the ratio of maximal T current to maximal L current (0.2 +/- 0.1, n = 8) was lower than the T/L ratio in Purkinje cells (0.6 +/- 0.2, n = 6). The density of peak L current in ventricular cells (7.5 +/- 1.7 pA/pF, n = 8) was higher than that in Purkinje cells (4.4 +/- 3.4 pA/pF, n = 6). Therefore, in ventricular cells the L current is the main Ca2+ current whereas in Purkinje cells, the T current also contributes significantly to membrane electrical activity. In Purkinje cells, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by isoproterenol (1 microM) increased L current but did not affect T current. On the other hand, in 70% (7 out of 10) of the Purkinje cells, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by 10 microM norepinephrine (in the presence of 2 microM propranolol) increased the T current. Our observations show that the distribution of the two types of Ca2+ channels in canine ventricle is heterogeneous and that the two types of Ca2+ channels are modulated by catecholamines by different receptors.\r"

PSD was produced by placing a split nylon ring around the thoracic aorta of the rabbits at a level of T6-7 during a sterile thoracotomy done under pentobarbital anesthesia. After period of PSD ranging from 1-51 months these rabbits were anesthetized, as were the control animals, and the descending thoracic aorta from the fourth to the eleventh ribs was removed following perfusion fixation with Karnovsky's solution at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg. The extent of PSD development was variable even though the stenotic ring was the same size in all rabbits. Ultrastructural findings showed degenerative changes of the wall components in the PSD region and were more prominent in the aortas with greater dilatation. Morphometric measurements showed that the PSD was accompanied by a decrease in volume density of both smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and elastin and an increase in collagen and ground substance. These changes were well correlated with degree of dilatation and ratio of internal radius to wall thickness (hence, mean wall stress) but not with duration of PSD. While the number of SMCs per unit volume in the PSD aortas was significantly less than normal (p less than 0.05), there was no significant change in mean cell volume. Although the reduced muscle mass might be expected to lower the capacity of the vessel to maintain tone, previous results show that this does not occur.\r"

  ".W": "It was investigated whether endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) content in platelets passing through the coronary bed. Boluses of washed platelets from healthy human donors were injected into the aortic perfusion line of isolated, saline-perfused rabbit hearts under constant flow conditions (28 +/- 2 ml/min). The coronary effluent was collected over 5 seconds, and the cGMP content of platelets was determined by radioimmunoassay. Platelet cGMP amounted to 0.34 +/- 0.11 pmol/mg protein after passage through the unstimulated coronary bed. During stimulation with acetylcholine (1 microM), it increased to 1.6 +/- 0.5 pmol/mg (p less than 0.01; n = 14). Simultaneously, the platelet recovery (measured over 20 seconds after injection) was enhanced (by 45 +/- 11%; p less than 0.01) during endothelial stimulation with acetylcholine. Treatment with the EDRF inhibitor hemoglobin (6 microM) completely abolished the increase in platelet cGMP (p less than 0.01; n = 11) as well as the enhanced platelet recovery (n = 8). Inhibition of EDRF by hemoglobin reduced also the basal platelet cGMP content to 0.17 +/- 0.11 pmol/mg (p less than 0.01). The data indicate that basally released EDRF is able to increase cGMP in platelets during a single passage through the coronary bed. The enhanced recovery of platelets after EDRF stimulation, which coincides with an increase of platelet cGMP, suggests that EDRF plays an important role as inhibitor of platelet activation in the coronary circulation.\r"

Single-channel Na+ currents in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were studied using the patch clamp method in the cell-attached mode. Angiotensin II applied outside the patch increased the frequency of opening and rates of activation and inactivation of single-channel Na+ currents within the patch. These effects were mimicked by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and were prevented by prior incubation with TPA. Therefore, we propose that angiotensin II modulates cardiac Na+ currents by a cytoplasmic second messenger, perhaps protein kinase C, and this may predispose toward arrhythmia.\r"

  ".W": "The inner ears of 5 adult patients with Pendred's syndrome were investigated using a Siemens SOMATOM DRG. Five normal hearing adults participated in the investigation as a control group. The CT-scanning comprised 10-15 consecutive scans of the cochlea. The CT evaluation was performed using both a special bone setting and a soft tissue setting. The cochlear content was quantitatively evaluated by drawing an irregular region of interest on the bone pictures. The region of interest was then transferred to the soft tissue pictures by means of the standard program of the CT-scanner. The resulting mean values of attenuation expressed in Hounsfield Units were significantly lower in the Pendred cochleas than in the normal cochleas. At the same time a typical Mondini malformed cochlea was demonstrated in all patients with Pendred's syndrome. The lower values of attenuation of the cochlea in Pendred's syndrome reflect the rudimentarily developed infra-cochlear osseous structures in this disease. We conclude that CT-scanning of the cochlea using this procedure is reliable enough to replace the conventional axial-pyramidal tomography when a Mondini cochlea is suspected.\r"

This is taken as evidence of Eustachian tube malfunction. Adenoidectomy is frequently performed as part of the surgical management for otitis media with effusion, but whether this affects Eustachian tube function is uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that if adenoidectomy improved Eustachian tube function, children who had undergone adenoidectomy would show less tendency to generate a high negative intratympanic pressure by sniffing. Eustachian tube function was studied actively in 40 children with otitis media with effusion. Twenty children, selected at random, underwent adenoidectomy and all 40 had a unilateral grommet inserted. Eighty-five percent of the children could create a negative middle ear pressure by sniffing, but there was no difference in the number of 'sniff + ve' children between the adenoidectomy and control groups (P greater than 0.5), or in the magnitude of the negative pressure induced. It is concluded that a high percentage of children with otitis media with effusion are capable of inducing a negative middle ear pressure by sniffing, but this parameter of Eustachian tube function is not affected by adenoidectomy.\r"

One ear remained deaf after a sudden hearing loss in the early stage of the disease. Serologically, 4 of 6 tested patients with sensorineural hearing loss demonstrated antibodies against sarcolemma. One patient showed antinuclear antibodies. It is remarkable that these antibodies can often be detected in classic inner ear disorders. The course of inner ear function, serum findings and the success of immunosuppressive therapy in Wegener's granulomatosis are comparable with immunologically mediated vasculitis in the inner ear.\r"

We studied all patients on maintenance dialysis at the Baumritter Kidney Center who were known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Five patients met the criteria for AIDS; another ten had anti-HIV antibodies but no opportunistic infections. The AIDS patients survived 8 to 18 months, and two are still alive. Mean survival in the AIDS group was 13.2 +/- 1.9 months, while the HIV(+) non-AIDS group survived 15.7 +/- 3.0 months. While these data are not statistically different, the survival curve in the AIDS group predicted a shorter survival than for the HIV(+) patients without AIDS. In fact, the survival of our dialyzed AIDS patients was similar to that reported for AIDS patients in general. Our experience suggests that dialysis may have no adverse effect on survival in AIDS. We conclude that dialysis patients with AIDS may survive 8 to 12 months or more and that the approach to such patients should be individualized.\r"

Our study consisted in measuring RFR by acute protein load (PL) in 3 groups of patients: the first one was composed of 20 patients (pts) with biopsy-proven glomerular disease (GN) and a varying percentage of sclerotic glomeruli (15-70%); the second one consisted of 10 patients with acquired single kidney (SK) and the third group contained 5 patients with surgical ablation of more than 50% renal tissue (LRRM). Twenty-four healthy volunteers were studied as control subjects. The GFR percentage increase (delta GFR%) after PL in CS did not differ from that of the three groups of patients, despite a significant difference in resting GFR (CS = 113 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2: GN 72 +/- 28 ml/min/1.7, p less than 0.01 vs CS; SK 81 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.01 vs CS; LRRM 45 +/- 10 ml/min/1.7, p less than 0.01 vs CS; Moreover, an inverse correlation was not found either between GFR and the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli in GN (r = 0.01, p = NS) or between GFR and the extent of excised renal tissue in the other two groups (r = 0.38, p = NS). In conclusion, our data do not confirm that RFR is necessarily reduced or absent in patients with a reduced number of functioning glomeruli, nor do they uphold the hypothesis of constant hyperfiltration in the remaining glomeruli.\r"

In order to establish a possible correlation between PE cells and clinical parameters, we studied the immunocompetent cells that are found in uncomplicated patients. In this study we used cytofluorimetric analysis to characterize phenotypically immunocompetent PE cells. We studied 17 children with a mean age of 8.7 +/- 5.3 years, who had been on CAPD for a mean duration of 16 months. The patients never suffered from peritonitis. The effluents were collected after overnight dialysis and centrifuged to concentrate cells. Surface phenotype of PE cells was tested with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The analysis of 40 PE samples showed that the various cell types were present with different frequencies, suggesting that a dominant phenotype cannot be defined. The ratio between M3 positive cells (monocytic-macrophagic lineage) and T3 positive cells (T lymphocytes) showed a tendency to decrease after initiation of CAPD. T4/T8 ratio in all samples did not differ from that of peripheral lymphocytes. A high frequency of activated T cells (41% +/- 13), defined by the presence of DR antigens on T3+ M3- cells, was seen in PE and confirmed by the high frequency of T cells expressing the IL-2 receptor.\r"

Furthermore, 11 of the 50 patients with chronic renal failure and a history of documented peptic ulcer disease had a similar prevalence of antibodies to C. pylori (45%) as did the 39 chronic renal failure patients without previous peptic ulcer (44%), which was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that in the control group of peptic ulcer patients (93%). Of 10 patients with chronic renal failure (6 with and 4 without gastric complaints) studied by endoscopical biopsies, two had chronic active antral gastritis and were positive for C. pylori by histology, culture and had IgG antibodies in their sera, while one patient with normal antral mucosa had IgG antibodies but was negative by culture and histology. Thus, this study shows that there is no predisposition to C. pylori infection among patients with chronic renal failure, and that C. pylori infection does not play a significant role in the ulcer diathesis in these patients.\r"

Employing an index of deterioration (the \"discrepancy score\") based on the discrepancy between current reading skills and current performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 6 LTHD patients, 2 STHD patients, 2 CAPD patients and 5 CRF patients were identified as functioning below their predicted premorbid optimum level. Cerebral sulci were abnormally wide in 22 patients (8 LTHD, 2 STHD, 6 CAPD and 6 CRF) and one of the STHD group also had cerebral ventricular dilatation. Nine patients had both an abnormal scan and evidence of cognitive deterioration, 13 had an abnormal scan in the absence of such evidence and 6 had evidence of cognitive deterioration and a normal scan. Both cognitive deterioration and the CT scan finding of widening of cerebral sulci were commoner in these patients than would be expected in an age-matched sample of the general population, but no simple relationship was found between anatomical abnormality and cognitive functioning. Statistically significant correlations were found between discrepancy score and the cumulative amount of aluminum prescribed to be taken orally in both LTHD and CAPD groups.\r"

The design is a modified hemisphere with flattening in the pole area and oversized cup diameter. A first series of press-fit cups were fitted with titanium nitride-coated stainless steel mesh. The manufacturing of such chemically pure titanium has only recently become feasible. Animal experiments using mountain sheep have shown an increase in the stability of the press-fit cup within the acetabulum with time and progressive bony ingrowth; this was verified in cups retrieved at autopsy. Three hundred eighty-seven first-generation titanium nitride-coated stainless steel mesh implants have been reviewed with a follow-up time of 12 to 39 months (average, 16.6 months). There were no intraoperative complications related to the cup. The roentgenographic follow-up study of 330 (85.1%) hips showed only a single case with a radiolucent line in all zones (1-3) as a roentgenographic sign of loosening, i.e., fibrous ingrowth. Two cups had to be revised due to insufficient primary stability and tilting.\r"

  ".W": "Rotational loosening has recently emerged as an important cause of failure of the femoral component of total hip arthroplasties. This study was designed to investigate the role played by torsional loads in loosening of cementless femoral components and to evaluate three cementing techniques involving a combination of canal irrigation, manual insertion, and vacuum mixing combined with pressure injection of the cement for their ability to improve rotational fixation. Rotational micromotion and subsidence were measured in 24 preserved human anatomic specimen femora. Acoustic emission (AE) technique was applied as a non-destructive method for evaluating material failure during loading. From the micromovement data, torque to 50 mu subsidence and torque to failure were surprisingly low with cementless fixation and with poor cement technique but were markedly improved with pulsed irrigation. Further improvement was achieved by pressure injection and vacuum mixing of the cement. However, AE was detected even in the most carefully performed cement specimens under torsional-loading conditions commonly occurring in daily activities. These signs of microfailure of the cement mantle at relatively low torsional loads suggest that the mode of failure of deeply penetrated cement is by microfracture of the cement mantle. The poor performance suggests that cementless fixation of intramedullary stems provides unsatisfactory fixation against torsional loading. There is need for major improvements in fixation mechanisms and techniques. The signs of failure of the cement mantle at normally occurring torsional loads suggest that even the best cement technique is prone to failure in torsion when exposed to normal daily use.\r"

A detailed biomechanical analysis evaluated bone strains and implant stability in both the single-limb stance and stair-climbing positions using a 100-pound spinal load. The stability offered by cement in these well-fixed prostheses was remarkable, with the maximum axial micromotion being 40 mu. This is a reflection of intimate osseointegration at the bone-cement interface with only rare intervening fibrous tissue. The strain gauge and photoelastic strain-coating studies revealed that marked stress shielding in the proximal medial femoral cortex persists long after a cemented femoral component is inserted. Even 17 years after surgery, the strain in the calcar region did not normalize.\r"

Anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms taken at annual intervals were used for comparison. At two years, 78% of the hips showed roentgenographic signs of stem osseointegration. Seventeen percent were clinically stable but demonstrated reactive lines surrounding the porous surface, indicating lack of bone-ingrowth fixation. Four percent showed late implant migration. Using late migration as an end point, a survivorship analysis of the stem stability was performed. The cumulative survival rate for stable fixation was 94% at five years and 88% at eight years. Among the 143 undersized stems, 17 showed late migration and two failed by stem fracture at six and eight years, giving a cumulative survival rate of 77% at eight years. By contrast, there were no roentgenographic failures among 200 canal-filling stems. Three stems were revised: two for stem fracture and one for loosening with infection. Proximal stress shielding occurred only in bone-ingrowth stems and was slightly progressive. Unstable implants produced progressive intramedullary canal widening. The clinical results were superior when the roentgenograms showed signs of bone-ingrowth fixation. Functional recovery in such cases was equivalent to that for cemented arthroplasty.\r"

  ".U": "90058998\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy of osteotomy for the precollapse stage of femoral head necrosis depends on altering load transmission. The alteration must reduce the stress levels on the infarcted bone during the process of repair. The prospects for success in this regard would likely be improved by the ability to predict reliably the stress changes derived from specific osteotomies for specific femoral head involvement patterns. For this reason, an anatomic three-dimensional finite-element model has been designed to compute necrotic femoral head stress changes that accompany varus, valgus, and rotational osteotomies. Four specific patterns of femoral head infarction are considered. Comparison of the patterns of load transmission at ten discrete instants (spanning the stance phase of the gait cycle) revealed that the critical stresses in the most commonly infarcted anterolateral and central femoral head regions occur just after the instant of heel-strike. For the femoral head with a deep, narrow lesion in the weight-bearing tract, and for classic wedge-shaped segmental infarct, the data showed that 30 degrees varus osteotomy was beneficial in reducing stress levels through much of the infarcted region. The 30 degrees valgus osteotomy was less successful. Neither 30 degrees anteversion nor 30 degrees retroversion osteotomies caused substantial changes in stresses for infarcted regions along the weight-bearing tract. For the case of a wide, shallow lesion or for whole femoral head involvement, none of the four osteotomies considered was able to achieve appreciable net reduction of stresses in weakened, infarcted regions.\r"

One hundred sixteen hips with AVN had decompression and grafting; 74 were also treated with direct current (DC). The DC stimulation was via a coil inserted directly into the femoral head. These were compared to 55 hips with AVN treated nonoperatively. Hips treated with electrical stimulation showed less roentgenographic progression and achieved a better clinical score than hips treated with decompression and grafting alone. Both groups had a significantly lower incidence of arthroplasty than the nonoperated controls. One patient developed a pulmonary embolus, but there were no fractures or other complications. Decompression and grafting are safe and reasonably effective in retarding the progression of AVN. Supplemental electrical stimulation seems to improve the results even further.\r"

Both techniques reduce the incidence of clinical and roentgenographic progression.

No femoral or acetabular components were revised. Roentgenographically no femoral component was definitely or probably loose. One acetabular reconstruction component had migrated.

As the clinical experience has increased, it has become apparent that, if the procedure is to succeed, specific criteria have to be met. In general, a valgus/flexion osteotomy should be done in patients younger than 40 years who have a Ficat Stage II and/or crescent sign. A necrosis angle of less than 200 degrees as measured on anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms is also important in predicting a successful outcome. Caudal oblique roentgenograms also help determine the status of the posterior femoral head and whether the osteotomy is feasible. Preoperative planning is important to reduce operating time and obtain a good end result. A 95 degrees blade-plate is used, and if necessary, a small wedge is excised to ensure coaptation of the osteotomy segments. The results of the procedure in 17 patients show that eight patients have a satisfactory result at a mean of three years, while three patients continue to have problems. Five patients have been converted to total hip arthroplasties, and one has a girdlestone arthroplasty. The unsuccessful results occurred in patients who were on corticosteroids or had continued metabolic bone abnormalities. Present experience confirms reports of other series. The operation should be offered only to the small group of patients with idiopathic, posttraumatic, or alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.\r"

The derived data included dose and frequency of narcotic administration on the day of surgery and during the subsequent three days. On the first postoperative day, the total morphine given averaged only 16.4 mg in patients receiving epidural morphine compared to 27 mg in those receiving only conventional parenteral morphine. Similar significant differences persisted through the second postoperative day. Intermittent epidural injection of small doses of morphine can give satisfactory and prolonged analgesia for early postoperative pain management.\r"

The BSI was inserted in 35 shoulders of 33 patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (20 cases), degenerative arthritis (ten cases), and posttraumatic lesions (five cases). The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 140 months (average, 63 months). Pain relief was good to excellent in 31 shoulders; four experienced some pain during daily activities. After BSI, motion was greatly improved with 71 degrees average range of abduction, 23 degrees range of adduction, 79 degrees range of flexion, 45 degrees range of extension, 76 degrees range of internal rotation, and 28 degrees range of external rotation. BSI was well-tolerated by the bone and soft tissues, with no erosive changes at the coracoacromial arch. There was no evidence of loosening at the cement-bone interface. One patient with a postoperative subcoracoid dislocation maintained a good functional result for more than 11 years. One BSI had draining sinus tract with negative culture, which spontaneously healed following removal of the implants. There were 3.3 mm (range, -7 mm to 11 mm) of superior subluxation of the humeral head on the preoperative roentgenogram. This increased to 8.7 mm (range, -5 mm to 20 mm) in the long-term follow-up roentgenogram. The bipolar implant is specially indicated in the severely arthritic shoulders in patients with vertical humeral subluxation and complicated histories of multiple failed operations.\r"

Arthrography of the posterior subtalar joint is an objective parameter, identifying peri- or intraarticular pathology as the cause of symptoms. In 27 patients with STS, the pathologic arthrographic findings include less-marked microrecesses in the sinus tarsi region, ganglions at the anterior aspect of the subtalar joint, retraction of the joint recesses, a smooth and rounded appearance of the capsule, and a frozen subtalar joint. Through analysis of these films, the appropriate therapeutic approach can be outlined; infiltrations into the sinus tarsi itself, intraarticular corticosteroid injections, or subtalar arthrodesis for resistant cases are the procedures of choice. In the authors' experience, surgical curettage of the sinus tarsi has no place in the treatment of STS.\r"

The purpose was to evaluate clinical experience with three different acetabular components. In chronological order, the three components tested were bipolar type, truncated-cone screw-in type, and porous-coated titanium press-fit type with fins. These were combined with four different bone augmentation constructs, using nonstructural morselized fresh-frozen allograft or segmental freeze-dried allograft. Follow-up evaluation of both the bipolar and screw-in designs showed frequent migration with bone graft resorption, compromising the clinical scores and leading to some revisions. The press-fit design had little migration, reliable graft healing, and better clinical scores. No revisions have been done. The nonstructural morselized bone allograft fared better under stable cups. The large segmental grafts did much better when buttress plating was combined with interfragmentary screw fixation compared to screws alone.\r"

Eriksson, of Sweden, has been a pioneer in studying the force needed to distract the hip joint to allow adequate arthroscopic viewing. Johnson, of Michigan, has provided information on techniques including landmarks, needle positioning and cannula entry. Glick, of California, has described the lateral position for ease of entry of arthroscopic instruments just superior to the greater trochanter. A mini-arthrotomy technique has been used to sublux the femoral head anteriorly from the acetabulum to allow anterior viewing and debridement. An initial series of such procedures in 12 patients resulted in general improvement in symptoms of younger patients with localized articular cartilage defects. Results in older patients with diffuse osteoarthritic changes involving most of the weight-bearing zone of the femoral head were unsatisfactory, however, with most of those patients requiring total hip arthroplasty, within one to two years. Recently, arthroscopy of the hip has been performed in the outpatient surgery department under general endotracheal anesthesia in the lateral decubitus position. Mechanical distraction with 9-18 kg of force has been used routinely, without postoperative neurologic symptoms. Specially adapted long arthroscopes and powered synovial resectors and abraders have been used. In addition, pressurized saline inflow with 100 mmHg of pressure has provided improved joint visualization. Especially helpful has been the availability of angled arthroscopes, including 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees arthroscopes. Potential complications include inadvertent cartilage scuffing, broken instruments, neovascular injury to nearby structures, and local infection. Systemic complications such as pulmonary embolus must always by considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For the primary hips, the custom group was found to have statistically higher Harris pain scores (less pain) at all follow-up intervals as compared to a prior series by the same surgeon using an off-the-shelf (OTS) prosthesis. Revision customized hip implants had lower Harris pain and total scores than primary custom hips, but 80% were in the none or slight pain category. In revision cases, the use of custom components decreased the need for structural bone grafting and achieved stability on host bone in situations in which it was not possible using OTS components. Complications included failure by aseptic loosening of one primary and one revision case. Initial subsidence of more than 3 mm of the collarless custom design occurred in 8%, the majority being in revision cases. All cases but one appear to have stabilized. Subsidence occurred mainly in cases done early in the series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A system has been developed that allows the surgeon to match a prosthesis to any femoral cavity. The surgeon may choose how and where it will preferentially fit. The surgeon does not have to create a cavity to suit a premade prosthesis. The system is based on a novel technique for making a mold of the prepared femoral cavity. This is accurately and thoroughly measured using a laser. An implant is designed and manufactured while the operation is in progress using state-of-the-art computer and machining techniques. All important parameters such as neck length, offset, and anteversion are fully variable intraoperatively. To date, more than 800 consecutive procedures have been carried out. In a limited trial, no subjective difference was found with a cemented Charnley total hip arthroplasty at one year. It currently takes about 40 minutes to manufacture the implant and make it available in the operating room, and this time is being continually reduced. Using a femur first approach, operating time is not greatly extended. In the future, perhaps the operating time will not be extended at all. All data including cavity geometry are centrally recorded for analysis.\r"

Adolescent Drug-Abuse Treatment Programs in five geographic regions across the United States were studied to determine the severity and patterns of cocaine abuse. Of these, 341 admitted to cocaine use and became part of this survey. Cocaine use was categorized as heavy, intermediate, or light. Areas examined were the addictive spectrum, psychosocial dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms. Intermediate and heavy users of cocaine abused significantly less marijuana and inhalants than light cocaine abusers. Heavy and intermediate users were more likely to use cocaine intravenously and to use crack. They developed tachyphylaxis more frequently, progressed to weekly use in less than 3 months more frequently, and became preoccupied with obtaining and using cocaine significantly more frequently. They used more sedative hypnotics to calm themselves and engaged in more criminal behavior, such as stealing from parents and stores and passing bad checks. They had more arrests for possession of drugs, stole more cars, sold more drugs, and were more likely to trade sexual favors to obtain the drug. Heavy and intermediate users were significantly more psychiatrically disturbed than light users, becoming more suspicious, nervous, aggressive, and demonstrating increased symptoms of fatigue, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, and increasing cocaine dysphoria. All of these symptoms could be mistaken for psychiatric disorders. This study suggests that cocaine is as addictive in adolescents as in adults; possibly more so. It also causes psychosocial dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms. Further research into cocaine addiction among adolescents is indicated.\r"

The mean zidovudine plasma levels were significantly higher after concurrent administration of probenecid than in its absence, resulting in a twofold increase in the mean AUC, a corresponding decline in the apparent total clearance, and a prolongation in the mean half-life. Similar alterations were observed in GAZT disposition. There was a marked reduction in the urinary excretion ratio of GAZT to zidovudine and a decline in the renal clearance of GAZT after probenecid coadministration. Probenecid inhibits zidovudine glucuronidation and renal excretion of GAZT.\r"

All human tissues studied contain a thermostable (TS) form of PST, which catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of \"simple\" phenols such as p-nitrophenol, and a thermolabile (TL) form, which catalyzes the sulfation of dopamine and other monoamines. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that genetically controlled levels of TS and TL PST activity in the platelet, as well as inherited variations in the thermal stability of platelet TS PST, might reflect those same characteristics of the enzyme in the less accessible tissue, human small intestinal mucosa. Platelet TS and TL PST activities and TS PST thermal stability were measured in blood samples from 45 randomly selected healthy subjects, and 14 of those subjects were selected to have intestinal biopsies performed. There was a significant correlation between levels of platelet and jejunal mucosal TS PST activity (rs = 0.574, p less than 0.030), but there was not a significant correlation between levels of TL PST activity in the two tissues (rs = 0.265, p = 0.368). There was also a significant correlation between the trait of TS PST thermal stability in the two tissues (rs = 0.828, p less than 0.0001). These observations suggest that inherited variations in TS PST activity and thermal stability in an easily obtained tissue, the platelet, might be used to predict individual differences of those properties of the enzyme in the human small intestine, an organ that plays an important role in drug metabolism.\r"

Psoriasis patients had significantly higher basal plasma homocysteine levels than age-matched control subjects. In addition, the methionine loading test was abnormal in four of the patients, but this was not significant. Psoriasis patients, although not folate deficient, did have lower serum folate levels than control subjects. There was a significant and transient increase in fasting plasma homocysteine levels within 48 hours after administration of low-dose methotrexate. This response was repeated after each administration and was observed eight to 20 times in three patients whose progress was monitored for 2 to 6 months. Notably, methotrexate did not affect the plasma profile for homocysteine after methionine loading. This study showed the level of fasting plasma homocysteine to be a sensitive and responsive parameter of antifolate drug treatment.\r"

With use of a series of antisera that recognize different human cytochrome P450 isozymes, we were able to identify an enzyme of the P450III gene family as one of two enzymes. By expressing human P450IIIA4 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) in HepG2 cells, we directly demonstrated lidocaine-deethylase activity for this P450 isozyme. These data suggest that P450IIIA4 is at least in part responsible for microsomal MEGX formation.\r"

The observed plasma concentration ratio between the parent drug and its metabolite 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucuronide is governed by the variables of protein binding, the metabolic rate of midazolam, and the renal clearance of the glucuronide metabolite itself (which can be considered as a measure of the kidney function of the patient).\r"

Gastric pH was monitored under fasting conditions by means of an indwelling pH sensitive electrode. The continuous infusion regimens provided the most constant level of acid suppression. A \"breakthrough\" decrease in gastric pH began at approximately 6 PM at the 6.25 mg/hr dose level. The drop in pH at the 10 mg/hr dose level was less impressive. Ranitidine, 100 mg every 12 hours, resulted in better acid suppression than the regimen of 50 mg every 8 hours. A gastric pH greater than or equal to 4 was achieved 35 to 50 minutes after the start of administration for all regimens. The median effective concentration (EC50) of ranitidine was approximately 45 ng/ml. Continuous infusion regimens, with a dosage adjustment for the time of day, may be the optimal dosage regimen for patients requiring continuous protection from gastric damage by hydrochloric acid.

Indenolol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist whose sympathomimetic properties have been shown in vitro but not in human beings. We infused indenolol cumulatively (5, 15, and 50 micrograms/100 ml tissue per minute for 15 minutes each, preceded by an infusion of saline solution) into the brachial arteries of nine hypertensive patients. Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were monitored. During infusion at 5 micrograms/100 ml tissue per minute, forearm blood flow did not change, but it did increase dose-dependently at the greater infusion rates. This action was determined to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation because propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml tissue per minute for 15 minutes), given before treatment and then concomitantly with indenolol, abolished it (n = 5). Indenolol vasodilated forearm arterioles and this effect was antagonized by beta-blockade, thus demonstrating vascular intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This property may contribute to its therapeutic action in human beings.\r"

Antihypertensive responsiveness was determined for each individual patient in terms of millimeters of mercury of blood pressure reduction per nanogram per milliliter of plasma prazosin concentration. The principal findings were that there was significant attenuation of antihypertensive responsiveness, from 11.5 mm Hg per nanogram per milliter after the first dose to 8.7 mm Hg per ng/ml after 1 week of treatment with prazosin. Correspondingly, there was significant attenuation of the degree of alpha 1-antagonism as assessed by the pressor response to intravenous phenylephrine. However, there was no significant further attenuation of either assessment during continued treatment for up to 3 months. These findings suggest that after an early adaptation, which occurs within the first week of treatment, there is no long-term attenuation of the antihypertensive effect of prazosin. Despite this initial adaptive change, the magnitude of the long-term antihypertensive effect of prazosin was predictable from the first dose response in individual patients.\r"

N-Acetylcysteine was administered on both occasions when acetaminophen was ingested to protect against glutathione depletion. Blood samples were collected serially for 12 hours after acetaminophen administration, and total urine volume was collected for 24 hours. Fractional clearances of acetaminophen through renal and metabolic routes (sulfation, glucuronidation, 3-hydroxylation, and glutathione conjugate formation) were not altered by cimetidine administration. Studies in microsomes prepared from two human organ donors indicated that cimetidine inhibited acetaminophen reactive metabolite formation noncompetitively, with Ki values of 0.35 mmol/L and 0.32 mmol/L for the respective livers, which is 5 to 10 times the putative cimetidine concentration required for therapeutic effect.\r"

Thus, the protective role of superoxide dismutase is particularly important. 2. Al3+ in concentrations similar to those found in the serum of uraemic patients inhibits superoxide dismutase activity. The degree of inhibition is directly proportional to the Al3+ level. 3. The combination of excessive oxygen free radical production with an increased Al3+ level may contribute to a variety of complications, including aluminium dementia or initiation and promotion of carcinogenic processes, which are known to be more common in uraemic patients.\r"

  ".W": "1. Recent evidence suggests that a high salt diet increases bronchial reactivity, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. 2. To determine whether alterations in circulating vasopressin might be responsible, we have studied the effect of an infusion of vasopressin on the airways of six normal and eight asthmatic subjects measuring the response as expiratory flow at 30% of vital capacity (V30P) in the normal subjects and as forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) in the asthmatic subjects, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. 3. Vasopressin, given as an infusion at a rate of 2 i.u./h for 1 h, followed by 4 i.u./h for a further hour, produced plasma concentrations of 12.8 and 17 ng/l, respectively, compared with 2.0 and 2.0 ng/l on placebo. 4. Airway reactivity to histamine was measured after 1 and 2 h as the provocative doses of histamine causing a 40% reduction in V30P (PD40V30P) in the normal subjects and a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PD20FEV1) in the asthmatic subjects. 5. There was a small increase in PD40V30P after both vasopressin and placebo in normal subjects (refractoriness) but no change in PD20FEV1 in the asthmatic subjects. 6. There was no significant difference between vasopressin and placebo in V30P or PD40V30P over the 2 h after the drug in the normal subjects or in FEV1 or PD20FEV1 over the 2 h after the drug in the asthmatic subjects. 7. We conclude that alterations in circulating vasopressin are unlikely to be responsible for the increase in bronchial reactivity when dietary salt intake is increased.\r"

In order to gain information on the effect of protoporphyrin IX on changes in the properties of the canalicular plasma membrane, we studied the release of canalicular membrane constituents, namely phospholipids, cholesterol and 5'-nucleotidase, into bile in anaesthetized rats receiving saline or taurocholate (0.5 mumol min-1 100 g-1 body weight) with or without protoporphyrin IX infusion (10 or 20 micrograms min-1 100 g-1 body weight). 2. Protoporphyrin IX induced an impairment of spontaneous bile flow and of biliary secretion of cholesterol, phospholipids and bile acids. The taurocholate-induced increase in bile acid output was not significantly reduced by protoporphyrin IX at either of the doses used. However, when a cholestatic dose of protoporphyrin IX was infused, the taurocholate-induced bile flow and secretion of lecithin and cholesterol were significantly reduced. 3. Biliary output of phospholipid species other than lecithin did not counterbalance the protoporphyrin IX-induced reduction in biliary lecithin secretion. Biliary outputs of both total phospholipid and lecithin were inhibited by protoporphyrin IX to similar extents. 4. Protoporphyrin IX alone had no effect on the biliary release of 5'-nucleotidase, whereas when it was given with taurocholate, it increased the bile acid-induced biliary output of this enzyme markedly. 5. In summary, these results indicate that protoporphyrin IX impairs the biliary secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol but not that of bile acid. The release of canalicular membrane constituents other than lipids was also modified by protoporphyrin IX.\r"

It dilated lung vessels and reversed hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. 2. In rats kept 2 weeks in 10% O2 in a normobaric chamber and simultaneously treated with ligustrazine, right ventricular hypertrophy and muscularization of pulmonary arterioles were attenuated compared with saline-treated rats. Pulmonary artery pressure, measured in isolated lungs perfused at a constant flow rate, was also less in ligustrazine-treated rats. 3. In isolated blood-perfused lungs of chronically hypoxic and control rats, the relation between pressure and flow was measured during normoxia (ventilation with air plus 5% CO2), hypoxia (2% O2 plus 5% CO2) and after ligustrazine during continued hypoxia. Alveolar pressure was always greater than left atrial pressure; thus flow was determined by the pulmonary artery minus alveolar pressure difference. 4. Pressure/flow lines were measured during normoxia in four groups of rats: (1) control, saline-treated; (2) control, ligustrazine-treated; (3) chronically hypoxic, saline-treated; (4) chronically hypoxic, ligustrazine-treated. Both chronically hypoxic groups had steeper lines (higher resistance) than the control groups, which were similar in all respects. However, in chronically hypoxic rats, the extrapolated intercept of the line on the pressure axis, probably attributable to small newly muscularized arterioles in a state of tone, was much increased in the saline-treated group but did not differ from controls in the ligustrazine-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dietary protein intake, weight and plasma glucose were monitored during the course of the experiment, and, at regular intervals, urine collections were made utilizing metabolic cages. 3. No significant differences were found in protein intake or plasma glucose between the two strains. 4. Proteinuria was higher in the diabetic Lewis rats than in the diabetic DA rats, and the difference became progressively greater with the passage of time. After 6 months of diabetes, the median values for proteinuria were 19.9 mg/24 h in the Lewis rats and 9.0 mg/24 h in the DA rats. 5. Electron microscopic examination revealed a greater degree of mesangial expansion in the glomeruli of the Lewis rats than in those of the DA rats after 6 months of diabetes. The median fractional mesangial area was 44.8% in the diabetic Lewis rats and 31.4% in the diabetic DA rats. 6. These results suggest that Lewis rats possess an inherited susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy, and that DA rats are relatively resistant. These differences in susceptibilities support the hypothesis that inherited glomerular properties determine an individual's susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy.\r"

In this study we investigated the cerebrovascular response to intravenous administration of glycerol (1 g/kg, infused over 25 min) in dogs under pentobarbital anaesthesia. 2. intracranial pressure, systemic arterial pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, serum osmolarity and packed cell volume were continuously monitored, and blood gases were checked frequently. Through a parietal cranial window, pial vessel diameter was measured by means of a surgical microscope and a video image-analyser. 3. Pial vessel diameter increased gradually with a maximum at 30 min after the beginning of glycerol infusion. The maximum increase in diameter in small (less than or equal to 100 microns) vessels was 14.3%, whereas that in large (greater than 100 microns) vessels was 10.3%. There was only a slight increase (less than 4%) in pial vessel diameter in vehicle-infused animals. The intracranial pressure decreased drastically after glycerol infusion, whereas the mean arterial blood pressure remained constant. There were correlations between the rise in serum osmolarity, fall in packed cell volume and vasodilatation, indicating that glycerol caused vasodilatation accompanied by plasma volume expansion. 4. Our data suggest that glycerol produces cerebral vasodilatation, which might be beneficial in cerebral ischaemia and vasospasm, in addition to its intracranial pressure-reducing effect on normal or oedematous brain. The degree of vasodilatation was not sufficient to affect the predominant intracranial pressure drop resulting from cerebral dehydration.\r"

  ".W": "1. The interaction of ouabain, a Na+/K+ adenosine 5'-triphosphatase inhibitor, with sympathetic mechanisms of vasoconstriction, as well as its possible site(s) of action, were investigated in forearm arterioles of patients with uncomplicated hypertension. 2. Intra-arterial infusion of ouabain per se decreased forearm blood flow without changes in systemic arterial pressure or contralateral flow. However, the vasoconstrictor effect of the glycoside was abolished after local pretreatment with either phentolamine, a competitive alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, or bretylium tosylate, a neurotransmitter blocker. 3. To exclude a non-specific effect due to the vasodilatation, a similar protocol was performed using histamine, which acts independently of sympathetic mechanisms. The vascular effect of ouabain was maintained in spite of histamine-induced increases in forearm blood flow even greater than those obtained from either blocker. 4. To discriminate between pre- and post-synaptic site(s) of action of ouabain, exogenous noradrenaline was infused intra-arterially after inactivation of local neurotransmitter release by bretylium, thus causing direct postsynaptic vascular alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Under these conditions, noradrenaline decreased forearm blood flow irrespective of the presence or absence of ouabain. 5. Thus, local sympatholysis by drugs acting on different levels of the sympathetic neuroeffector junction abolished the effect of ouabain, whereas histamine did not influence it. The data provide positive evidence for an effect of ouabain on sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. This action is apparently not exerted at a postsynaptic site but possibly by enhancing neurotransmitter release. 6. If a circulating endogenous ouabain-like Na+/K+ adenosine 5'-triphosphatase inhibitor is relevant to the development of hypertension in man, it might act through a similar mechanism.\r"

Eighteen others showed postural hypotension, defined as a fall in blood pressure to outside the limits of two SDS from the mean values of age-related control subjects. 4. Patients who showed postural hypotension had a mean fall in cardiac output significantly larger than that in age-related control subjects. Responses in the nonhypotensive patients did not differ significantly from controls. 5.

Evidence suggests that activation of phospholipase A2 and production of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor (PAF) are involved in various responses associated with severe tissue damage and shock. It was postulated that the plasma level of the precursor and degradation product of PAF, lyso-platelet-activating factor (lyso-PAF), might be increased in acute severe illness. 2. After plasma extraction, lyso-PAF was acetylated in vitro to PAF, which was measured by bioassay using 5-[14C]hydroxytryptamine-labelled rabbit platelets. Measurements were made in 18 severely ill patients (five with cardiogenic shock; five with severe infection, five after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, two with acute pancreatitis; 13 males, five females). Plasma lyso-PAF in these patients was 33 +/- 15 (SD)ng/ml (range 5-111 ng/ml), whereas values in normal males (40-65 years) ranged from 102 to 253 ng/ml (n = 15) and in females from 74 to 174 ng/ml (n = 10). Depression of plasma lyso-PAF did not relate closely to the patient group nor to specific therapy, but repeated measurements in each of 10 patients showed an increase in plasma lyso-PAF (P less than 0.002), associated with clinical improvement. 3. Evidence was obtained indicating that neither the presence of an inhibitor in the assay system nor reconversion of PAF to lyso-PAF in vitro produced the unexpected depression of plasma lyso-PAF. 4. The mechanisms responsible, which may have therapeutic implications, remain to be elucidated.\r"

Of the 62 patients evaluated (27 with sarcoidosis, 18 with IPF, and 17 with a CV disease and lung involvement), 49 had irregular linear opacities and 13 had normal chest x-rays. There were no significant correlations between the types of cells present in BAL fluid and the various categories of infiltrate or profusion of the infiltrates within each disease group. In patients with sarcoidosis, more extensive infiltration (profusion) was associated with lower FEV, (p less than 0.01). In patients with IPE, linear opacity type, profusion, and the presence or absence of honeycombing were not related to the severity of pulmonary function abnormalities. We conclude that the ILO classification for analysis of chest roentgenograms can be applied to patients with interstitial lung disease not associated with an occupational exposure and that this approach is useful, especially for communication. However, these data provide no information regarding the inflammatory process in the lung and limited information regarding abnormalities in pulmonary function.\r"

Using 18-G TBNA, we can obtain specimens for histologic examination from paratracheal, peribronchial, and carinal areas by FOB. Both 18-G and 22-G TBNA were performed in 34 patients with radiographic abnormalities involving mediastinal or hilar areas. Tissue for histologic examination was obtained in 17 patients (50 percent) using 18-G TBNA and was diagnostic in 11 (32 percent), including three patients with benign conditions. The overall diagnostic yeild of 18-G TBNA was 41 percent (14/34 patients), increasing the yield of FOB from 50 percent to 58 percent. There were no false positive results and few minor complications. 18-G TBNA is effective in obtaining tissue for histologic examination and diagnosing benign conditions. In selected cases this technique increases the diagnostic yield of FOB.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effects of dopexamine hydrochloride, a new synthetic adrenergic agent with predominant beta 2-adrenergic and dopaminergic properties, were studied in nine patients with inadequate cardiac output during the course of an episode of respiratory failure associated with lung infection. Dopexamine at doses up to 5 microgram/kg/min had no significant effect on arterial pressure or cardiac filling pressures, but increased cardiac index from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 L/min.m2. Left ventricular stroke work increased from 17.3 +/- 15 to 22.1 +/- 2.4 g.m/m2 (p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 3,792 +/- 1,035 to 2,194 +/- 823 dynes.s.cm5.m2 (p less than 0.01). The increase in cardiac output was in part related to an increase in heart rate from 91 +/- 6 to 102 +/- 7 beats/min. Under a mean inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.48, the PaO2 decreased from 105 +/- 12 to 91 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) as venous admixture increased from 15.8 +/- 1.0 to 18.1 +/- 1.4 percent (p less than 0.05). Accordingly, the combination of inotropic, afterload-reducing and renal vasodilating effects of dopexamine can be useful acutely to increase cardiac output in critical conditions. However, its administration can be limited by a dose-related increase in heart rate. Dopexamine, like other catecholamines, alters blood oxygenation and increases venous admixture.\r"
