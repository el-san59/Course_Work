Computed tomography could not differentiate tumor from scar. All patients presenting increased uptake of fludeoxyglucose F 18 by the mass were proved by histologic studies to suffer from recurrent tumor. Six of seven patients with low fludeoxyglucose uptake had nonmalignant lesions. Using immunoscintigraphy in 14 patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, only four of ten recurrences could be identified by increased antibody accumulation in the mass. On the other hand, two of four benign lesions were interpreted as being recurrent tumor because of high uptake. Therefore, only positron emission tomography seems to be a useful diagnostic tool in the differentiation of recurrent rectal cancer and scar by providing information about the metabolic activity of a mass.\r"

Asymmetry in cerebral glucose metabolism within these diagnostic groups was assessed by comparison with the metabolic rates obtained in age-equivalent healthy control subjects. A significantly greater number of individuals in both patient groups exhibited predominant left rather than right hemisphere hypometabolism. In addition, for patients with Alzheimer's disease, the degree of asymmetry was not related to either the severity or duration of dementia. These findings could be explained by greater susceptibility of the left hemisphere to degenerative or ischemic brain disease, by a specific sampling effect, or most likely, by greater metabolic deficits resulting from left rather than right hemisphere impairment.\r"

The patient's disease progressed greatly from the age of 36 to 47 years. Two brothers had regional involvement of the posterior pole with disturbances of retinal function attributable to localized disease, and there was only mild progression in these patients. A corneal biopsy specimen from the more severely affected patient and biopsy specimens from a patient whose case had been previously reported demonstrated crystals resembling cholesterol or cholesterol ester and complex lipid inclusions in corneal and conjunctival fibroblasts. Similar inclusions were present in circulating lymphocytes, suggesting that Bietti's crystalline corneal-retinal dystrophy may be due to a systemic abnormality of lipid metabolism.\r"

At that time, we reviewed their medical charts to record the numbers and sites of fractures which had been diagnosed during the preceding 1 to 5 years of nursing home residence, the duration of this period depending on the duration of institutionalization. Fractures during the period of nursing home residence under review had occurred in 24 of the 153 men; 6 residents had experienced two or more fractures. Fracture rates during institutionalization in hip, spine, and wrist were 2,564, 366, and 549/100,000 patient years, respectively. The incidence at all sites was 5,861/100,000 patient years. These rates were 5 to 11 times higher than the figures previously reported in the age-matched general population of white men in the United States, England, or Finland. The nursing home men who had experienced fractures at any site were significantly (nondirectional P less than 0.02) older than those who had not experienced any fracture. The hip fracture group, however, did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) in age from the no fracture group.\r"

After exposure to UVC CFU-GM, BFU-E and PHA responses showed a UV dose-dependent sharp decrease to levels less than 1% of controls with 0.5, 2.0, and 10 mJ/cm2, respectively. With UVB, PHA responses were most sensitive, declining to less than 1% at 5 mJ/cm2. BFU-E decreased to less than 1% of control with 15 mJ/cm2 UVB. CFU-GM, at UVB doses of 0.1 to 2.0 mJ/cm2, increased to 125% to 130% of control and decreased to less than 1% only at exposures greater than 20 mJ/cm2. Thus, these studies show that UVB, but not UVC light, can be used to inactivate bone marrow T lymphocytes selectively while sparing hematopoietic precursor cells. The data suggest that UVB irradiation can be used for T-lymphocyte purging for allogeneic marrow transplantation.\r"

The CD7+, CD4-, CD8- phenotype was associated with a distinct clinical entity with those affected predominantly male (either less than 35 years or greater than 65 years of age), with frequent mediastinal and/or thymic masses, skin and CNS disease, high peripheral WBC counts, and bone marrow blasts that were morphologically L1 or not ascribable to a specific lineage. These patients did not respond to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for either acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemias. No common karyotype or T-cell gene rearrangement pattern could be defined. Importantly, seven of eight patient's leukemic cells studied were capable of multilineage (myeloid, erythroid, monocytoid, megakaryocytoid, and lymphoid) differentiation in vitro. Data is presented suggesting that CD7+, CD4-, CD8- leukemias, in many instances, are leukemias of immature hematopoietic cells. The development of novel therapeutic approaches to this form of leukemia will be necessary to alter its poor prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Gangliosides, which are complex glycosphingolipids containing sialic acid, are found in cell membranes and have been implicated in a variety of cell surface events including cellular adhesion. Complex gangliosides were observed to inhibit the adhesion of thrombin-activated platelets to substrates of fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen. This adhesion, which is mediated by the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, was differentially inhibited by gangliosides depending on the number of sialic acid residues present within the ganglioside. The observed order of effectiveness was GT1b greater than GD1a greater than GM1 greater than asialo-GM1. Another structurally related glycosphingolipid, globoside, exhibited little inhibitory activity. In contrast to the inhibition of platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor mediated by the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, gangliosides had no detectable effect on the ristocetin-dependent adhesion of platelets to von Willebrand factor mediated by glycoprotein Ib. These results suggest that the function of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex may be modulated by gangliosides in a manner similar to that previously described for the closely related vitronectin receptor.\r"

Using a T-lymphocyte colony forming assay (T-CFU-Ic) we have demonstrated that a drastic depletion of circulating T-CFU-Ic prefigures the development of clinical immunodeficiency disease in inoculated cats and correlates with the appearance and replication of the FeLV-FAIDS variant genome in serially collected bone marrow samples. During the same presymptomatic time period, no significant alterations in conventional mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenic responses or in circulating lymphocyte numbers were evident. Thus T-CFU-Ic assay but not conventional mitogen-driven blastogenesis identified animals destined to develop immunodeficiency syndrome. The correlation among T-CFU-Ic depletion, the replication of the lymphocytopathic FeLV-FAIDS variant genome in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, and the onset of clinical disease, infers that ablation of a colony-forming T lymphocyte progenitor subset is important in the early pathogenesis of feline retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human multiple myeloma (MM), we investigated the potential role of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a B-cell differentiation factor in humans, and a growth factor for rat/mouse heterohybridomas and murine plasmacytomas. Using a heterohybridoma assay, we found that two well-documented human myeloma cell lines, RPMI 8226 and U266, did not secrete IL-6 and did not express RNA messengers for IL-6. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 did not inhibit their proliferation, and recombinant IL-6 did not stimulate it. Taken together, these data show that IL-6 is not the autocrine growth factor of these human myeloma cell lines. A high production of IL-6 was found in the bone marrows of patients with fulminating MM, compared with patients with inactive or slightly active MM, or to healthy donors. This IL-6 production was assigned to adherent cells of the bone-marrow environment but not to myeloma cells. A spontaneous proliferation of myeloma cells freshly isolated from patients was observed in short-term cultures. Recombinant IL-6 was able to amplify it two- to threefold. The spontaneous proliferation of the myeloma cells was inhibited by anti-IL-6 antibodies and reinduced by recombinant IL-6. After 2 to 3 weeks of culture, the myeloma-cell proliferation progressively declined and no IL-6-dependent myeloma cell lines could be obtained despite repeated additions of fresh IL-6 and costimulation with other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)beta, or IL-1 beta. These data demonstrated a paracrine but not autocrine regulation of the growth and differentiation of myeloma cells by IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the accumulation, primarily in bone marrow, of a clone of plasma cells. The nature of the stem cells feeding the tumoral compartment is still unknown. To investigate this special point, we have studied the phenotypes of nine well-known human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and compared them with those of normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Twenty-four clusters of differentiation involved in B lymphopoiesis were investigated using a panel of 65 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). For each cluster, the percentage of positive cells and the antigen density were determined, giving rise to a \"quantitative phenotype\". We thus classified the HMCLs into two different groups: those with cytoplasmic mu chains (c mu+) and those without (c mu-). In the first (c mu+) group, comprising seven cell lines, the HMCLs had a phenotype of pre-B/B cells close to that of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. They expressed low densities of surface mu chains, without detectable cytoplasmic or surface light chains. Three of them were infected with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). These c mu+ HMCLs bore most of the B-cell antigens except CD23. They expressed the CALLA antigen (CD10) and lacked the plasma-cell antigen PCA1. In contrast, LCLs expressed surface light chains, high densities of CD23, low densities of PCA1 antigen, and no CD10 antigen. The c mu- HMCLs had a plasma-cell phenotype, lacking most of the B-cell antigens and expressing high densities of PCA1 antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL) is a newly recognized B-cell neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis. The cytologic features of the neoplastic monocytoid B lymphocytes are virtually identical to those of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). As with HCL, progression of MBCL to a higher histologic grade is very unusual. However, whereas circulating leukemic cells are a characteristic feature of HCL, peripheral blood involvement has not been reported in MBCL. We recently studied a patient with MBCL of the spleen and axillary lymph nodes who developed peripheral blood involvement by MBCL cells. Unlike the cells of HCL, the circulating MBCL cells exhibited strong acid phosphatase activity that was tartrate sensitive. The leukemic cells had the antigenic phenotype IgM lambda, CD20+, CD11c+, CD5-, CD25(TAC)-, and PCA-1-. Immunogenetic studies of both lymph node and peripheral blood cells revealed identical immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements. When compared with a series of HCL, the immunophenotype was similar except for the absence of PCA-1 and TAC. Progression of the MBCL to a large cell lymphoma, also expressing IgM lambda, was documented in an abdominal lymph node of this patient. Therefore, although rare, peripheral blood involvement by lymphoma cells may occur during the course of MBCL and should be distinguished from HCL with cytochemical and immunophenotypic studies. In addition, comparison of the clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of MBCL with those of other low-grade B-cell neoplasms suggests that a close lineage relationship exists between MBCL and HCL.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a potent mediator of growth and differentiation of cells of several hematopoietic lineages. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow cells. By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized the IL-4 and IL-5 genes to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, the IL-4 and IL-5 genes were found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of four patients with refractory anemia (RA) or therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL), who had a del(5q). Thus a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-4, IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF as well as other genes such as CD14 and EGR1. Our findings that each of these genes was deleted in the 5q- chromosome suggest that loss of function of one or more of these genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders associated with a del(5q).\r"

  ".U": "89134993\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) is a macrophage-derived, multifunctional cytokine that broadly potentiates myelopoiesis and induces the synthesis of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSF) in vitro and in vivo. To evaluate the possibility for use of IL-1 alpha in ameliorating in vivo bone marrow suppression induced by drugs or radiation, we examined the in vivo effects of the cytokine on erythropoietic and other hematopoietic progenitor cells. Normal mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of recombinant human IL-1 alpha at varying doses and were assayed at various times post-treatment. By six hours postinjection, a significant suppression of mature erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) was observed in animals treated with IL-1 alpha (0.5 micrograms/mouse), with maximum suppression of CFU-E and peripheral blood reticulocyte counts occurring at 24 hours. Decreases in peripheral blood hematocrit did not occur after a single IL-1 alpha injection but were observed after multiple injections of the cytokine. The suppressive effects of IL-1 alpha on late-stage erythropoiesis were abrogated by simultaneous administration of erythropoietin (EPO). At 48 hours post-treatment, a marked stimulation was observed in the numbers of spleen and marrow immature erythroid (BFU-E), macrophage (CFU-M), granulocyte (CFU-G), granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), and megakaryocyte (CFU-meg) progenitor cells. These results demonstrate the potential use of IL-1 alpha as a generalized stimulator of hematopoiesis and show that the cytokine-induced suppression of late-stage erythropoiesis can be prevented by EPO.\r"

Surprisingly, identical monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) sequences could be demonstrated in the uncultured bone marrow AML cells and in the cell line that also had kappa light chain gene rearrangement. This is the first case to our knowledge of an EBNA positive B-cell line with identical monoclonal Ig heavy chain rearrangement as detected in myeloblastic leukemia cells.\r"

  ".W": "Normal mouse serum (NMS) devoid of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) was found to enhance the interleukin 3 (IL-3)-driven colony formation of bone marrow in vitro. Inclusion of NMS in bone marrow colony-forming assays resulted in greatly increased numbers of colonies and clusters following seven days incubation; however, incubation of bone marrow with NMS before the colony-forming assay had no effect on resultant colony number. The levels of serum-enhancing activity (SEA) did not appear to vary significantly with age and in part was species restricted, in that human and guinea pig serum did not enhance mouse bone marrow colony formation. Conversely, NMS had no effect on human bone marrow colony formation. Levels of SEA were found to vary between strains, as did the degree to which bone marrow from various strains was enhanced by the serum. Serum fractionation studies indicated three active fractions with molecular weights of 800-900 Kd, 60-70 Kd, and 20-30 Kd. The fraction at 800-900 Kd inhibited colony formation at high concentrations and enhanced colony formation on dilution, whereas the two other active fractions contained enhancing activity at all concentrations tested. These results would indicate that normal serum can play a greater role in colony-forming assays than nutritional supplements. The relationship of the SEA factors to other factors that have been reported to modulate bone marrow colony formation is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The major part of von Willebrand factor (vWf) synthesized in cultured endothelial cells is secreted constitutively without stimulation and consists of all multimeric forms of vWf. In contrast, stimulation with secretagogues such as thrombin results in the release of vWf from the storage pool, the Weibel-Palade bodies which contain only the largest, most biologically potent multimeric forms of vWf. We wished to determine whether the signal for release of vWf might also function as a signal for replenishment of the vWf by enhancing de novo biosynthesis and if replenishment of the vWf storage pool involved a diversion of newly synthesized vWf from the constitutive pathway to the regulated pathway. vWf mRNA and protein levels in unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells were compared with cells that were briefly stimulated with 1 U/mL thrombin for 15 minutes and then incubated without thrombin for periods up to 72 hours. A comparison was also made between unstimulated cells and cells continuously exposed to thrombin for up to 48 hours. Thrombin stimulation, brief or continuous, had no significant effect on subsequent biosynthesis of vWf protein or vWf-specific mRNA. Since thrombin releases vWf only from the storage pool, we examined the possibility of diversion of newly synthesized vWf from the constitutive pathway to the regulated pathway. Cells were pulse-labeled, incubated for 15 minutes with and without thrombin, chased for various periods in unlabeled media, and briefly restimulated with thrombin. No significant redistribution of vWf between the two pathways was observed as a result of thrombin stimulation for the time periods tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

HD37-SAP is directed against CD19, the broadest B cell-specific determinant. HD39-SAP and HD6-SAP recognize two different epitopes on the CD22 molecule, an antigen present on the cell surface of B cells at late stages of differentiation. All three immunotoxins inhibited DNA synthesis and protein synthesis in target B lymphoma cells with a dose-related effect, in short incubation times and in the absence of potentiators. A clonogenic assay demonstrated that all immunotoxins could eliminate more than two logs of clonogenic malignant B cells with a two-hour incubation at concentrations not toxic to cells not bearing target antigens. The immunotoxin activity was evaluated by DNA synthesis inhibition in fresh B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) stimulated to proliferate by incubation with an antibody specific for the receptor of C3b complement component (CR1) plus B cell growth factor. B-CLL cell DNA synthesis was actively inhibited by treatment at low immunotoxin concentration without need of potentiators. Immunotoxins exerted their effect also in whole blood of CLL patients under conditions achievable in vivo. We conclude that B cell-restricted immunotoxins HD37-SAP, HD39-SAP, and HD6-SAP are good candidates for in vivo therapy of B-cell malignancies.\r"

The effect of ibuprofen on primary haemostasis was investigated in 20 patients on warfarin for venous thromboembolism. Ibuprofen, 600 mg orally t.i.d., was added for 1 week. Bleeding time, prothrombin time, platelet count and urinalysis for haemoglobin were performed before and 90 minutes after the first dose and after 1 week. The bleeding time was significantly prolonged after 90 minutes (p less than 0.01) and after 1 week (p less than 0.05) and in four cases it was prolonged above the normal range. No clinical side-effects were observed apart from microscopic haematuria and haematoma. Thus, ibuprofen may cause clinical problems in some patients treated with warfarin, particularly in the elderly on complex drug regimens. It is advisable to check the bleeding time a few days after treatment with ibuprofen has been started in patients already on oral anticoagulation, and discontinue the former if the bleeding time is prolonged above the normal range.\r"

Clinical experiences have been primarily with LV doses of 25, 200, and 500 mg/m2 administered by either short-term intravenous infusion, daily continuous infusion, or orally. In patients with lung carcinoma, oral administration of dl-LV at 125 mg/m2 hourly for 4 hours (total dose of 500 mg/m2) gave the following peak plasma folate concentrations: dl-LV, 4.6 + 1.9 microM; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 4.3 + 2.1 microM; and no detectable l-LV in most cases. The d-LV/5-methyltetrahydrofolate ratios, however, were lower for the oral route than for the same dl-LV dose administered by 2-hour intravenous infusion in the same patient. To determine if there is a relationship between the dose, schedule, or route of administration and the therapeutic efficacy of LV combined with 5-FU, studies were carried out in rats with transplantable colon carcinoma. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate was administered at various doses by either 2-hour infusion, 2-day continuous intravenous infusion, or by divided hourly oral doses for 4 hours. In all cases, the total doses of dl-LV administered were 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Data obtained to date indicate: (1) plasma folate concentrations by intravenous administration were dose dependent, but lower and saturable concentrations of folates were observed by oral administration; and (2) while the concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate achieved by the 2-hour infusion schedule were relatively constant and independent of the dose of dl-LV administered, conversion of dl-LV to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate with the 2-day infusion of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg was dose dependent. In humans, however, conversion was independent of the route of administration of dl-LV (19% for the 2-hour infusion and 23% for the 5-day infusion of 500 mg/m2 dose). Preliminary results for antitumor activity of 5-FU in combination with dl-LV, administered by either 2-hour intravenous infusion (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) or orally (100 mg/kg/hour for 4 hours), yielded similar inhibition of in vivo tumor growth, each being greater than what was achieved with 5-FU alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "As part of a clinical trial of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (LV) for treatment of patients with advanced head and neck cancer, patients received 100 mg of LV (d,l-5-formyltetrahydrofolate) orally every 4 hours for 5 days. On days 2 and 4 of treatment, plasma samples were obtained 2 hours after (peak) and 30 minutes before (trough) a dose of LV. Total LV and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (THF) concentrations were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. LV stereoisomer concentrations were determined by chiral HPLC on a bovine serum albumin-bonded silica column. Thus far, plasma folate levels have been analyzed for ten cycles of treatment administered to 7 patients (40 samples). Administration of LV in divided oral doses approximates a plasma steady state with no significant differences noted between peak and trough concentrations. Mean (+/- SD) plasma concentrations for all samples were (mumol): LV, 3.2 +/- 1.3; l-LV, 0.28 +/- 0.21; d-LV, 2.9 +/- 1.2; and THF, 4.25 +/- 2.5. Plasma levels of d-LV and THF tended to be approximately 10% higher on day 4 than day 2, although mean differences were not significantly different due to substantial interpatient variability. Of note was that the sum of THF and l-LV exceeds that of d-LV which was consistent with selective absorption of the l-isomer of LV. Mean ratios of d-LV/l-LV and d-LV/l-LV and THF were 13.7 +/- 10 and 0.88 +/- 0.68, respectively. The authors conclude that oral administration of LV in divided dose (1) simulates a continuous intravenous infusion; (2) produces plasma levels of l-reduced folates in a range known to potentiate 5-FU cytotoxicity; and (3) results in low ratios of d/l-reduced folates that may be important in maximizing the effectiveness of 5-FU-LV chemotherapy.\r"

None of the patients had received previous chemotherapy. The results of the study showed a overall complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) of 45%. All responding patients received the 600-mg/m2 dose of 5-FU. There were five CR and nine PR. An additional seven (23%) patients had stable disease. Two of the seven received the 450-mg/m2 dose of 5-FU and the remainder received 600 mg/m2. The median disease-free interval for CR patients exceeded 25 months, while the interval for PR patients was 11.8 months. The median survival for CR patients was over 26.7 months and 16.5 months for the PR patients. The median survival for stable patients was 9.5 months and 5.5 months for patients with progressive disease. Toxicity included diarrhea in 70% of patients, excess lacrimal secretion in 35%, and nausea and vomiting in 25% There were no treatment-related deaths in this group. The authors conclude from this Phase I study that the optimal 5-FU dose in 600 mg/m2 combined with high-dose oral leucovorin for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma.\r"

The first trial used LV administered by intravenous infusion with a constant dose of 5-FU 400 mg/m2, and the second trail used oral LV with increasing doses of 5-FU. In the first trail, 45 eligible patients (20 with and 25 without previous therapy) were treated. Toxicity usually consisted of diarrhea or weakness and was controlled by delaying or decreasing the 5-FU dose. Subjective responses occurred in 75% of patients but did not correlate with antineoplastic effect. Objective responses were seen in 36% and stabilization of disease in 31% of patients; these correlated with prolonged survival. Median survival was 8 months for patients with previous treatment and 10 for those without. Twelve-month survival was 32% and 40%, respectively. There was no correlation between the development of toxicity and response or survival. The second trial was conducted recently in cooperation with Duke University to determine toxicity and efficacy of oral LV with intravenous 5-FU before a randomized trial of this combination versus placebo with intravenous 5-FU. Eighteen patients were treated, and serum levels of folates were obtained on ten. First toxicity occurred at 5-FU doses ranging from 375 to 850 mg/m2, and consisted of diarrhea in nine, lethargy in seven, nausea/vomiting in four, dermatitis in four, conjunctivitis in two, hypersalivation in two, stomatitis in one, and profound granulocytopenia in one. Response rate was 35%, and stabilization was 35% with median survival of 14 months. Twelve-month survival was 56%.\r"

  ".W": "Both cisplatin and leucovorin may increase the activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by increasing the intracellular concentration of reduced folates. Therefore, a Phase I study was conducted in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in which high doses of oral leucovorin were added to the combination of cisplatin and 5-FU. Patients received intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU at 600 mg/m2/day for 5 days. Leucovorin 50 mg/m2 orally was administered from the start of the cisplatin infusion and then every 6 hours throughout the 5-FU infusion. The dose of 5-FU was increased to 800 mg/m2/day and 1 g/m2/day according to observed toxicity. In a second phase of the study, the dose of leucovorin was increased to 50 mg/m2 orally every 4 hours. Twenty-five patients were registered: 23 had recurrent head and neck cancer after extensive treatment; two had newly diagnosed metastatic disease. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU was 800 mg/m2/day with leucovorin administered every 6 hours. Toxicities at that level included mild-to-moderate myelosuppression. Mucositis in the previously irradiated field prevented the further increase of the 5-FU dose to 1 g/m2/day. Identical toxicities were observed when administering 5-FU at 800 mg/m2/day with 50 mg/m2 of leucovorin every 4 hours. Eighteen patients were evaluated for response: one had a pathologic complete response; nine had a partial response (including four who had previously received cisplatin and 5-FU as induction chemotherapy). Eight patients did not respond. The median survival for all 25 patients was 6.5 months. It was concluded that the combination of cisplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin is active in the treatment of recurrent head and neck cancer. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in previously treated patients is 800 mg/m2/day, with mucositis being the dose-limiting toxicity. Further investigation of this regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer is in progress.\r"

To identify specific molecules that activate the classical complement pathway, detergent lysates of canine cardiac mitochondria were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper (NCP). The NCP replicas of the gels were incubated with isolated C1q and fresh sera as a source of complement, washed briefly, and overlaid with sensitized sheep erythrocytes (RBC) in agarose. A cluster of four to six molecules between 45 and 53 kDa as well as four others, 34, 30, 26, and 23 kDa, consumed complement thereby preventing complement-mediated lysis of sensitized sheep RBC in the agarose overlay. Additional molecules reactive with C1 were identified by their ability to bind isolated human C1q and to serve as assembly sites for later acting complement components. Sites of localization of complement were demonstrated by incubating NCP replicas of fractionated mitochondria with antisera specific for C1q, C3, C5, and C9, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin and substrate. A total of 12 C1q binding molecules ranging in size from 67 kDa to 23 kDa, which can fix later acting complement components, were identified. At least two of these reacted with antisera prepared against canine cardiac lymph collected in the first 3-4 hours after a 45-minute coronary artery occlusion. These studies present direct evidence that specific molecules, released from subcellular fractions of myocardial cells rich in mitochondria, can activate the complement cascade.\r"

  ".W": "Disease surveillance and population surveys of risk characteristics in a northeast rural community of Japan (1965 census population, 7,030) are combined in an attempt to relate morbidity and risk factor trends for coronary heart disease and stroke during the last 2 decades. Between 1964 and 1983, the incidence of coronary heart disease (i.e., combined myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and sudden death) did not change significantly among men and women ages 40-69, and was lower than that for stroke. The incidence of all stroke declined about 60% for both men and women, ages 40-69, with a significant decrease in cerebral hemorrhage for both sexes and in cerebral infarction for men. Between 1963-1966 and 1980-1983, significant upward shifts occurred in the means and distributions of serum total cholesterol and serum total protein in every age and sex group, primarily during the 1st decade. Age-adjusted mean cholesterol levels rose 22 mg/dl to the 1980-1983 mean of 179 mg/dl in men ages 40-69. In women ages 40-69, the mean rose 29 mg/dl to 192 mg/dl. Among nutrients, animal fat intake doubled in men ages 40-59 from 4.5% of daily calories in 1969 to 9.6% in 1980-1983. Animal protein intake also increased, from 5.8% to 7.1%. Most of this increase occurred between 1969 and 1972-1975 and may be attributable to an increased intake of meat, eggs and dairy products. From 1963-1966 to 1980-1983, mean relative weight index rose significantly for all age-sex groups except men ages 50-69. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels declined for every age-sex group, with a 15-mm Hg age-adjusted decrease in systolic, 4-mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure among men ages 40-69, and a 11-mm Hg systolic and 4-mm Hg diastolic decrease for women. Two cohorts of men and women ages 40-69 at baseline were followed for disease incidence: an early cohort (2,257 persons) followed from 1963-1966 to 1973 and a later cohort (2,711 persons) followed from 1972-1975 to 1983. In these cohorts, significant risk prediction for cerebral hemorrhage and infarction was obtained with blood pressure level and end organ effects in the electrocardiogram and fundus photographs. Serum cholesterol was inversely associated with cerebral hemorrhage in the early cohort but not in the later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Twenty dogs were studied: 11 after regional denervation, and nine as controls. Regional denervation was done by left stellate ganglion removal, right stellate ganglion removal, and application of phenol to the epicardial surface. Computer-processed functional maps displayed the relative distribution of MIBG and thallium in multiple projections in vivo and excised heart slices in all animals. In six animals, dual isotope emission computed tomograms were acquired in vivo. Tissue samples taken from innervated and denervated regions of the MIBG images were analyzed for norepinephrine content to validate image findings. Normal controls showed homogeneous and parallel distributions of MIBG and thallium in the major left ventricular mass. In the left stellectomized hearts, MIBG was reduced relative to thallium in the posterior left ventricle; whereas in right stellectomized hearts, reduced MIBG was in the anterior left ventricle. Phenol-painted hearts showed a broad area of decreased MIBG extending beyond the area of phenol application. In both stellectomized and phenol-painted hearts, thallium distribution remained homogeneous and normal. Norepinephrine content was greater in regions showing normal MIBG (550 +/- 223 ng/g) compared with regions showing reduced MIBG (39 +/- 44 ng/g) (p less than 0.001), confirming regional denervation. Combined MIBG-thallium functional maps display the regional distribution of sympathetic innervation. This new ability to noninvasively map the distribution of sympathetic nerves with simultaneous comparison to regional perfusion may provide important new insights into mechanisms, whereby an imbalance in sympathetic activity may relate to clinical disorders.\r"

Forty-one patients were evaluated with prospective laboratory assessment, anteroposterior and frog-lateral roentgenograms of both hips, intraosseous pressure measurements (IOP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 99mTc methylene diphosphonate planar and single-photon emission computerized tomographic (SPECT) bone imaging. Pathologic specimens were obtained in most patients. Preradiographic disease was identified in 26 hips and 11 of these were asymptomatic. Fifteen clinically symptomatic hips had normal plain roentgenograms, but abnormal protocol studies. Evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value (positive and negative), respectively, in diagnosing osteonecrosis of the femoral head revealed the following percentages: 83%, 83%, 96%, and 48% for planar bone scanning; 91%, 78%, 94%, and 70% for SPECT; 87%, 83%, 96%, and 55% for MRI; 80%, 60%, 95%, and 25% for IOP; and 88%, 100%, 100%, and 25% for core biopsy. (There were few true negatives, thus specificity values are approximations.) The identification of preradiographic stages is possible, but difficult. MRI appears appealing at present, particularly in identifying disease in asymptomatic hips. However, there is no definitive method for noninvasive diagnosis. Pathologic confirmation in early stages is difficult.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effects of the cAMP-independent protein kinase-C system and interleukin-1 (IL-1) on secretion of ACTH and POMC gene expression in cultured rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells, AP cells were incubated with CRF, 8-bromo-cAMP, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. After 15 h of incubation, CRF and 8-bromo-cAMP increased both ACTH release and the POMC mRNA level. Arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated ACTH release but failed to increase basal or CRF-stimulated POMC mRNA levels. Human recombinant IL-1 alpha and -beta increased neither ACTH release nor POMC mRNA levels after 3 h of incubation. After 15 h of incubation, 100 pM to 10 nM IL-1 alpha and -beta increased ACTH release. However, POMC mRNA levels were significantly elevated only by 10 pM IL-1 beta. These results suggest that the CRF-cAMP system plays a major role in both ACTH release and expression of the POMC gene in AP cells, but the cAMP-independent protein kinase-C system contributes only to ACTH release; that acute stimulation of ACTH release from AP with IL-1 administration is not due to direct action of IL-1 at the pituitary level; that chronic exposure of AP cells to IL-1 alpha or -beta can stimulate ACTH release; and that the direct effects of IL-1 alpha and -beta on POMC gene expression, if any, seem to be minimal.\r"

We examined whether cultured fetal bovine bone cells synthesize FGF. These cells express characteristic markers of the osteoblast phenotype, including expression of bone Gla protein (osteocalcin) and mineralization. Heparin-Sepharose fractionation of cell extracts revealed that bone cells contained a basic FGF (bFGF)-like molecule, that displayed high affinity for heparin. The growth factor was mitogenic for adrenal cortex-derived endothelial cells and osteoblast-like bone cells. The major peak of biological activity corresponded to a peak of immunoreactive bFGF. When analyzed by Western blot, the active fractions contained a bFGF-like immunoreactive species with a mol wt of 15,000, a mass identical to that of (des-1-15)bFGF. Based on RIA, the bone cell extract contained an estimated 95 ng bFGF/mg cell protein. An acidic FGF-like molecule with lower affinity for heparin was also present in the purified bone cell extracts, although at an approximately 10-fold lower concentration than bFGF. These results demonstrate that bone cells synthesize a mitogen indistinguishable from bFGF. In addition, Northern analysis revealed that the bone cells expressed 3.5- and 7.0-kilobase bFGF gene transcripts. We next examined whether the bone cell-derived bFGF is stored in a bioactive form in the extracellular matrix. Bone cells synthesized an extracellular matrix which was mitogenic for adrenal cortex-derived endothelial cells. However, if the bone cell extracellular matrix was preincubated with neutralizing anti-bFGF antibodies, its mitogenic properties were abolished. This suggests that bone cell-derived bFGF may function as an autocrine or paracrine mitogen via its deposition into the extracellular matrix of bone.\r"

PBMC cultures (2.5 x 10(6) cells), unstimulated or stimulated with PHA-M (25 micrograms/ml), from 20 type I diabetic patients (10 with time since onset less than 3 mo and 10 with long-term diabetes of less than 3 yr) and 10 control subjects were studied for the production of IL-2 and IL-2RS in their respective supernatants. No difference was found in IL-2 production in unstimulated cultures of type I patients compared with control subjects, although a significant decrease from PHA-M-stimulated cultures were seen (newly diagnosed, 1.7 +/- 0.3 ng/2.5 x 10(6) cells; long-standing, 2.2 +/- 0.3 ng/2.5 x 10(6) cells; P less than .001 and P less than .05, respectively) compared with control subjects (3.6 +/- 0.4 ng/2.5 x 10(6) cells).

Eleven normal postmenopausal women taking no medications were given conjugated E (0.625 mg daily) for 3-9 weeks. Supernatants from cultured peripheral monocytes were analyzed for IL-1 production by stimulation of a cloned murine helper T-cell line. IL-1 release was expressed as a percentage of maximum release corrected for monocyte number. IL-1 release before E treatment was 11.0 +/- 0.2% (+/- SE), it was 7.8 +/- 1.6% after E treatment (P = NS). IL-1 release fell in each of the three women with the highest initial values (46% to 5%, 25% to 17%, and 18% to 12%). IL-1 release did not correlate with serum osteocalcin or fasting urinary calcium either before or after E treatment. Addition of 10(-7)-10(-10) mol/L 17 beta-estradiol to cultured monocytes obtained before E treatment caused an increase in IL-1 release that did not follow a dose-response relationship. Treatment of postmenopausal women with E did not affect spontaneous IL-1 release by peripheral monocytes in vitro. The addition of E in vitro did not produce consistent changes in IL-1 release by these cells. This does not exclude the possibility that E may affect monocyte IL-1 release in subsets of women with high spontaneous monocyte IL-1 release with or without osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 1) the nature of the plasma ACTH response to ovine CRH (oCRH) in the absence of normal glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition and 2) the cause of the diminished circadian peak in plasma ACTH in normal men the morning after 3-30 micrograms/kg BW doses of oCRH. Placebo or oCRH (3 micrograms/kg BW, iv) was administered as iv injections to five normal men given metyrapone to produce acute glucocorticoid deficiency. Four studies were performed: 1) placebo oCRH plus placebo hydrocortisone (HC), 2) oCRH plus placebo HC, 3) placebo oCRH plus HC, and 4) oCRH plus HC. HC was given as a variable rate iv infusion to mimic the plasma cortisol response to the same dose of oCRH in normal men. Plasma cortisol levels rose only slightly after oCRH, indicating nearly complete blockade of cortisol biosynthesis. Plasma cortisol levels during the HC infusion were similar to those in normal men given 3 micrograms/kg oCRH. There was an exaggerated rise in both the first and second peaks of the plasma ACTH response to oCRH in the metyrapone-treated men. HC infusion did not alter the plasma ACTH response during the first 60 min after oCRH, but markedly attenuated the response thereafter; however, it did not affect the timing of the second peak. This inhibitory effect continued for up to 11 h, which was 2-3 h longer than the period that plasma cortisol levels were increased. Thus, cortisol secreted in response to ACTH released by oCRH modulates, after about a 60-min delay, the continuing release of ACTH. Despite the greater oCRH-induced release of pituitary ACTH in the metyrapone-treated men, the magnitude of their next morning's circadian plasma ACTH peak was similar to that after they received placebo oCRH. Thus, depletion of pituitary ACTH did not appear to explain the diminished circadian peak. Its magnitude was reduced by the combination of oCRH and HC, but not by HC alone. Administration of oCRH, alone or in combination with HC, delayed the onset of the circadian rise, while oCRH, HC, or the combination thereof delayed the time of the circadian peak. Thus, it appears that both the glucocorticoid response to oCRH and direct or indirect effect(s) of oCRH are required to produce these two phenomena.\r"

The bulimic women had increased 24-h transverse mean plasma ACTH [1.09 +/- 0.06 (+/- SE) vs. 0.75 +/- 0.14 pmol/L; P less than 0.05] and serum cortisol (235 +/- 21 vs. 152 +/- 9 nmol/L; P less than 0.005) concentrations. While the 24-h ACTH and cortisol pulse frequencies were unaltered, the bulimic women had higher (P less than 0.05) mean peak ACTH (1.46 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.15 pmol/L) and cortisol values (331 +/- 33 vs. 239 +/- 17 nmol/L). Despite having higher mean and peak plasma ACTH and serum cortisol values, the bulimic women had a blunted response of both ACTH (P less than 0.001) and cortisol (P less than 0.005) to hCRH, which included a lower mean maximal plasma ACTH response, decreased (P less than 0.05) integrated area under the ACTH response curve (161 +/- 12 vs. 231 +/- 23 pmol/min.L), a lower (P less than 0.05) maximum cortisol response (284 +/- 35 vs. 413 +/- 19 nmol/L), and decreased (P less than 0.05) area under the cortisol curve (11.1 +/- 1.9 vs. 15.9 +/- 1.3 X 10(3) nmol/min.L). The circadian variations of both ACTH and cortisol were maintained in the bulimic women; the nadir and acrophase times were similar to those of the normal women. However, the rise in serum cortisol that occurred within 1 h after the lunch meal in the normal women (104 +/- 35 nmol) did not occur in the bulimic women (P less than 0.05). These data demonstrate that marked changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function occur in bulimia in the absence of weight disturbance and suggest central activation of CRH and/or synergistic factors as well as alterations in signals from gut to brain in this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma 21-deoxycorticosterone (21-DB) concentrations were measured before (basal) and 1 h after ACTH stimulation in a population of 34 normal subjects, 18 patients with the late-onset form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LO-CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and 19 LOCAH heterozygotes. For comparison, plasma 21-deoxycortisol (21-DOF) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were determined simultaneously in the same subjects. Plasma 21-DB concentrations as well as those of 21-DOF did not vary significantly as a function of age, sex, or phase of the menstrual cycle, in contrast to plasma 17-OHP. The mean plasma 21-DB concentrations in normal subjects (adult men, follicular and luteal phase women, and children) were 19.0 +/- 9.5 (+/- SD) pmol/L before and 73.2 +/- 31.0 after ACTH stimulation. In the LOCAH patient group, the mean post-ACTH plasma 21-DB concentration was 1736.0 +/- 1243.0 pmol/L, and all values were above the highest post-ACTH value (148.2 pmol/L) in the normal subjects. Similarly, in the LOCAH patients the post-ACTH plasma 21-DOF concentration was 33.7 +/- 20.3 nmol/L, and the post-ACTH plasma 17-OHP value was 134.0 +/- 70.6 nmol/L; all LOCAH patients had supranormal responses to ACTH. However, 38.9%, 11.2% and 16.7% of the basal plasma 21-DB, 21-DOF, and 17-OHP values in the LOCAH patients overlapped those in the normal subjects. There was a rather large overlap (63.2%) in post-ACTH plasma 21-DB levels between the LOCAH heterozygotes and the normal subjects; it was less than the overlap in plasma 17-OHP (74%) and more than the overlap in plasma 21-DOF values (5.2%) in these same 2 groups. There was moderate overlap (21%) in the post-ACTH plasma 21-DB levels between the LOCAH heterozygotes and LOCAH patients, but no overlap between these 2 groups for either 21-DOF or 17-OHP. The abnormally elevated post-ACTH plasma 21-DB levels found in all the LOCAH patients as well as in some LOCAH heterozygotes suggest the existence of minor 21-hydroxylase deficiency in the mineralocorticoid synthetic pathway in these patients in addition to the well known impairment in the glucocorticoid pathway demonstrated by the elevated post-ACTH 21-DOF and 17-OHP levels.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can be caused by a variety of defects in the functional gene encoding 21-hydroxylase (P450c21), which lies in the midst of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on chromosome 6. As a result, Mendelian genetics permit clinically distinct forms of CAH to be traced genetically by HLA and complement typing of family members. The recent cloning of probes for P450c21 now permits tracing of the affected gene directly. A consanguineous family had three members affected with three clinically distinct forms of CAH. Two of these individuals had identical extended haplotypes, including nine HLA and complement loci. Despite this extensive identity, the patterns of genomic DNA fragments digested with endonuclease EcoRI and detected by a P450c21 cDNA probe differed greatly in these two individuals. Thus, the DNA diagnosis of allelic variation was much more sensitive than the HLA diagnosis. Genomic DNA digested with endonuclease TaqI and probed with P450c21 cDNA revealed the 3.2-kilobase (kb) band, which is generally associated with the nonfunctional P450c21 A pseudogene, in all family members, and also revealed the 3.7-kb band associated with the functional P450c21 B gene in all family members except the severely affected index case. Probing of the same blots with a genomic probe also permitted examination of the adjacent downstream TaqI fragments, showing retention of both the 2.4-kb (A pseudogene) and 2.5-kb (B gene) fragments. Similarly, BglII-digested genomic DNA from all individuals contained both the 12-kb (A pseudogene) and 11-kb (B gene) bands. These data indicate that the basis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency in the index case was due to a homozygous gene conversion event and not to gene deletion. These results show that the DNA in and around the 21-hydroxylase gene is genetically very active, so that the usual generalization concerning linkage and inheritance may yield incorrect conclusions and diagnoses.\r"

At the end of induction, 14/22 (64%) of patients had an objective antitumor response: three patients had a complete response, ten patients had a partial response (greater than or equal to 50% resolution of clinical disease), and one patient had a minor response. Responders included those with Stages Ia to IVa cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and remissions have lasted at least 4 to 27.5 months. Three patients progressed from a partial to complete response with further treatment, for an overall complete response rate of 27%. Acute flu-like side effects were generally minor and transient. Malaise/fatigue, depression, anorexia, and weight loss were common chronic dose-related side effects and the most frequent reasons for dose reduction or discontinuation of drug. Leukopenia was the most common laboratory side effect and was also dose-related.

One hundred twelve patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and 23 normal volunteers performed symptom-limited treadmill exercise, followed by stress and redistribution imaging by both tomographic and planar techniques, with the order determined randomly. Paired receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that single photon emission computed tomography was more accurate than planar imaging over the entire range of decision thresholds for the overall detection and exclusion of coronary artery disease and involvement of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. Tomography offered relatively greater advantages in male patients and in patients with milder forms of coronary artery disease, who had no prior myocardial infarction, only single vessel involvement or no lesion greater than or equal to 50 to 69%. Tomography did not appear to provide improved diagnosis in women or in detection of disease in the right coronary artery. Although overall detection of coronary artery disease was not improved in patients with prior myocardial infarction, tomography provided improved identification of normal and abnormal vascular regions, particularly of the left anterior descending and circumflex artery regions. These results indicate that single photon emission computed tomography provides improved diagnostic performance compared with planar imaging in many clinical subgroups, and suggest that it represents the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice in exercise thallium-201 perfusion studies.\r"

  ".W": "Splenocytes from young (3 to 4 mo) and aged (24 to 26 mo) C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 epsilon mAb in vitro. At the time of peak DNA synthesis (day 2), cells from aged mice incorporated congruent to 60% less [3H]TdR than cells from young mice. This age-related defect was not attributable to gross differences in anti-CD3 does optima, response kinetics, accessory cell function, numbers of T cells cultured, CD4+:CD8+ cell ratios or surface levels of CD3 epsilon molecules. In an attempt to analyze pre-S phase events in these responses, we monitored CD4+ and CD8+ cells in splenocyte cultures for the time-dependent expression of three T cell activation markers: RL388 Ag and IL-2R and transferrin R. Parallel analyses of mean T cell size and cell cycle phase distributions were performed. Non-activated T cells from both age groups similarly expressed moderate levels of RL388 Ag, low levels of transferrin R, and undetectable levels of IL-2R. Analysis of stimulated T cells revealed, in both age groups: 1) detectable increases in expression of all three markers by 6 h of culture, and continued increases associated with blastogenesis and G1 phase transit and 2) a preferential stimulation of the CD8+ subset to a state of high level marker expression. Age group comparisons of activation marker expression over time suggested that the age-related defect reflects proportionally smaller fractions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells that respond normally, rather than a general defect in all T cells or a subset-specific defect. Finally, we found that supernatants from aged donor cell cultures stimulated with anti-CD3 contained less Il-2 than those of young controls. Addition of an IL-2 containing supernatant to aged donor cell cultures increased, but did not restore, the S phase response on day 2; however, the response on day 3 was comparable to the peak (day 2) response of young controls. These data suggest that exogenous IL-2 can improve the aged response, perhaps by expanding the fraction of normally reactive T cells.\r"

Using radiolabeled PCC, the increased presentation by the macrophage was correlated with an increase in the uptake and rate of processing of the liposomal antigen. The elimination of presentation by the B cell was due to the inability of this cell type to internalize and degrade the encapsulated PCC. The results support the concept that the macrophage is the primary cell type involved in the initial stages of an immune response to a liposome encapsulated protein Ag in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "89140328\r", 
  ".W": "CD4 (T4) is a 60 kD glycoprotein expressed on a subset of T lymphocytes. CD4 augments T cell responses to suboptimal Ag stimulation. In addition, the CD4 molecule is the receptor for HIV-1. CD4 is phosphorylated on serine residues within the cytoplasmic domain and its cell surface expression is decreased in response to PMA, APC bearing the appropriate Ag or HIV infection. The kinetics of CD4 phosphorylation and modulation are similar, suggesting that the two events may be related. L3T4, the murine CD4 equivalent, is not modulated from the surface of mature, peripheral T cells in response to PMA. The difference in the ability to modulate L3T4 and CD4 in response to PMA may be due to differences between the two molecules or to differences between the cells in which they are expressed. To further define the requirements for CD4 modulation, we used retroviral vectors to transfer the cDNA for CD4 and various mutants of CD4 into two murine T cell hybridomas that express L3T4. One of these hybridomas, By155.16, does not modulate L3T4 in response to PMA and the other, 5D5.63, does modulate L3T4 in response to PMA. When expressed by these hybridomas CD4 is not modulated from the surface of By155.16 and is modulated from the surface of 5D5.63 in response to PMA. In both of these hybridomas, CD4 is phosphorylated on serine residues in response to PMA. A mutant form of CD4, CD4 delta, was constructed in which the majority of the cytoplasmic domain was deleted. When expressed in 5D5.63, CD4 delta was not modulated in response to PMA. Replacing the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 with that of the human IL-2 receptor did not reconstitute the ability of CD4 to be modulated. These results suggest that the inability to modulate L3T4 from the surface of murine peripheral T cells is due to features of the cell and not the molecule. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 is required for its modulation from the cell surface in response to PMA.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the acquisition of self tolerance in the thymus, full-allogeneic thymic chimeras were constructed. Athymic C3H and BALB/c nude mice were reconstituted with the thymic lobes of BALB/c and B10.BR fetuses, respectively, that were organ cultured for 5 days in the presence of 2'-deoxyguanosine. T cells in these chimeras were tolerized to the host MHC in both MLR and CTL assays. In contrast, T cells in the chimeras exhibited split tolerance for the thymic MHC haplotype. CTL specific for class I MHC of the thymic haplotype were generated not only from the peripheral T cells of the chimeras but also from thymocytes re-populated in the engrafted thymic lobes. However, T cells in these chimeras responded poorly to the class II MHC of the thymic haplotype in a standard MLR assay. In a syngeneic MLR culture upon stimulation with enriched APC of the thymic haplotype, only 22 to 48% of the responses were mediated by CD4+ cells, and proliferations of CD4- cells were prominent. There were no haplotype-specific suppressor cells detected which would cause the unresponsiveness to the thymic class II MHC. These results indicated that the thymic lobes treated with 2'-deoxyguanosine were defective in the ability to induce the transplantation tolerance for the class I MHC expressed on the thymus, although the same thymic lobes were able to induce the transplantation tolerance for the thymic class II MHC.\r"

  ".U": "89140330\r", 
  ".W": "Treatment with mAb to the L3T4 Ag on Th cells can inhibit autoimmunity in mice. However, the mechanism by which anti-L3T4 inhibits autoimmunity is not known. In these studies, lupus-prone NZB/NZW F1 (B/W) mice were treated with F(ab')2 fragments of mAb to L3T4 to determine whether Th cell depletion is required for the beneficial effects of anti-L3T4. We first showed that treatment of female B/W mice with F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 from age 5 to 9 mo significantly reduced autoantibody production without depleting L3T4+ cells. However, treatment was complicated by the development of a host immune response to the rat mAb fragments. To circumvent this problem, female B/W mice were treated with a single high-dose of intact rat mAb to L3T4 (GK1.5) at age two mo. to induce immune tolerance to the mAb. Then, after recovery of L3T4+ cells, the mice were treated from age four to 14 mo with either F(ab')2 anti-L3T4 (0.5 mg 3 times per wk), intact anti-L3T4, or saline. In mice tolerized by this regimen, neither the F(ab')2 rat mAb nor the intact rat mAb elicited a host response. The mAb fragments bound target Ag but did not deplete the Th cells, whereas intact mAb to L3T4 profoundly depleted the L3T4+ cells. Despite this difference, both therapies had the same substantial beneficial effects on autoimmunity. They significantly decreased anti-DNA Ab production, improved renal function and prolonged survival. The initial tolerizing dose, by itself, did not inhibit autoimmunity. These findings show that anti-L3T4 suppresses autoimmunity by directly altering Th cell function through the L3T4 Ag, and not solely by depleting Th cells. They also document the detrimental effects of the host immune response to therapy with anti-L3T4 mAb, and they demonstrate a new strategy by which this response may be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease can be transferred with lymphoid cells from actively immunized rats into naive recipients. In the mouse, previous studies have suggested a role for histamine/serotonin in the development of active EAE. We have found that myelin basic protein-reactive cells transfer a biphasic skin test response to naive rats analogous to what has been described in the mouse contact dermatitis system, where mast cell sensitization by Ag-specific T cell factors is required for the induction of skin test responses. Treatment of cell recipients with the serotonin receptor antagonists, cyproheptadine or methysergide, blocked or significantly reduced the development of EAE. Furthermore, it was found that treatment with cyproheptadine was effective in blocking clinical disease when administered day 3 to day 6 after cell transfer. In contrast, cyproheptadine treatments before induction of paralysis day 0 to 3, failed to alter the course of clinical disease. The inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, proxicromil, was also found to effectively block the elicitation of adoptively transferred EAE and was also found to be effective when administered just before the onset of clinical disease. Reserpine, a compound known to deplete mast cells of vasoactive amines by forcing granule contents into the cytoplasm where they are degraded by cell enzymes, was also effective in blocking both active and adoptively transferred EAE. Disease inhibition was found to be partially reversed with pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. In addition lymphocytes from treated animals were capable of transferring disease to naive recipients and appeared to have normal activity as assessed by Ag-or mitogen-driven proliferation in addition to IL-2 production.\r"

To investigate the possible involvement of these epitopes in collagen-induced arthritis, we raised rabbit anti-idiotypic antibodies that may bear the internal image of these epitopes. Anti-idiotypic antibodies developed against three anti-CII mAb designated as 1-5, 2-14, and 2-15 were demonstrated to recognize idiotype expressed on Ag-binding site (paratope) of their related mAb. Anti-CII antibody response specific for a given epitope could be induced in DBA/1J mice upon immunization with anti-idiotypic antibodies coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-idiotypic antibody to 1-5 antibody in particular could stimulate all DBA/1J mice for production of anti-CII antibody possessing Ag specificity and idiotype similar to those of 1-5 antibody. Although the mice immunized with anti-1-5 antibody alone did not develop arthritis, they did show a much more enhanced antibody response against a given epitope than did control mice non-treated with anti-idiotypic antibody upon the subsequent immunization with human CII. Some of the mice immunized with anti-1-5 antibody and challenged with human CII developed arthritis, whereas the control mice did not. These findings strongly suggest that a common epitope recognized by 1-5 antibody might be involved in the induction of arthritis.\r"

  ".U": "89140336\r", 
  ".W": "The HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds with high affinity to CD4 and is responsible for the tropism of HIV for CD4+ T cells and monocytes. Efforts to develop HIV vaccines have focused on gp120 and, therefore, a detailed molecular understanding of human immune responses to gp120 is essential. In this report, we have used human T cell clones specific for gp120 to examine the processing and presentation of gp120 to T cells. In particular, we examined the role of the CD4 that is expressed at low levels on the surfaces of human monocytes in the presentation of gp120 by monocytes. The presentation of gp120 to gp120-specific human T cell clones was blocked by pretreatment of monocytes with anti-CD4 mAb. Blocking of monocyte CD4 with anti-CD4 did not inhibit presentation of other Ag or of synthetic peptides representing epitopes within gp120 recognized by gp120-specific T cell clones. These results indicated that the anti-CD4-mediated inhibition occurred at the level of the monocyte, was specific for the gp120 response, and was operative at the initial Ag uptake phase of the Ag-processing pathway. Definitive confirmation that monocyte CD4 functions in the initial uptake step of the gp120-processing pathway was obtained by using soluble CD4 to block the interaction of gp120 with monocyte CD4. These results demonstrate that gp120 expressed by human monocytes plays an important role in the initial uptake of gp120 by monocytes and that gp120 taken up via CD4 is subsequently processed to allow for exposure of epitopes recognized by gp120-specific human T cells. At limiting gp120 concentrations, uptake via CD4 is essential for the presentation of gp120.\r"

  ".W": "Functional studies were performed on human peripheral blood T lymphocytes stained with goat anti-5'-nucleotidase antibodies and separated into ecto-5'-nucleotidase (ecto-5'-NT)-positive and -negative populations using the FACSTAR fluorescence-activated cell sorter. On the average, ecto-5'-NT+ T cells contained 34 +/- 13% CD4+ and 55 +/- 15% CD8+ cells, whereas ecto-5'-NT-T cells contained 65 +/- 12% CD4+ and 23 +/- 8% CD8+ cells. Staining with anti-5'-NT antibodies did not significantly alter the ability of unseparated T cells to proliferate in response to PHA or PMA, or in a MLR. However, prior incubation with anti-5'-NT antibodies did inhibit the ability of irradiated T cells to provide help for PWM-stimulated Ig synthesis by as much as 55%. In five separate experiments, ecto-5'-NT-T cells demonstrated an equal or better ability to incorporate [3H]TdR after PHA stimulation or in a MLR, as compared with ecto-5'-NT+ T cells. Similarly, ecto-5'-NT- T cells were not diminished in their ability to provide help for autologous B cells in a PWM-driven system. Clearly, the inability of ecto-5'-NT- T cells from patients with a variety of immunodeficiency diseases to function in these assays cannot be explained solely by their lack of ecto-5'-NT activity. In contrast, ecto-5'-NT-positive and -negative T cells showed markedly different dose-response curves for proliferation in response to PMA. Ecto-5'-NT+ T cells responded to lower doses of PMA (1.0 ng/ml) than did ecto-5'-NT- T cells and showed a two- to eight-fold greater rate of [3H]TdR incorporation at 3 to 10 ng of PMA per ml. Ecto-5'-NT+ T cells may have a protein kinase C that is more accessible or more easily activated or may utilize an alternate pathway of activation when stimulated with low concentrations of PMA.\r"

  ".W": "Three strains of mice (NZB/W F1 X NZW (NZB/W), BXSB, and MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr] develop an autoimmune disease that is clinically and immunologically similar to human SLE. A characteristic of these mice is polyclonal B cell hyperactivity. To explore whether this may be related to hyper-responsiveness to B cell stimulatory factors, we investigated the proliferative and secretory responses of B cells from these mice to semi-purified natural and rIL-5, a major regulator of B cell development in the mouse. As this lymphokine stimulates growth and differentiation of activated B cells, attention was focused on in vivo-activated B cell populations, obtained from the interface of 50/65% Percoll density gradients, from normal or autoimmune mice. This cell population from NZB/W mice secreted IgM and incorporated [3H]TdR at significantly higher levels in response to IL-5, and was more sensitive to IL-5, than a comparable population from several normal murine strains. NZB/W female and male mice displayed heightened responses to IL-5, indicating that this is characteristic of the strain in general and is not associated with the accelerated severe disease of the females. Small resting B cells from NZB/W and normal mice were insensitive to IL-5 stimulation. In contrast to NZB/W mice, no difference was observed in the magnitude of either proliferative or Ig secretory responses between in vivo-activated B cell populations from autoimmune BXSB and MRL/lpr or normal mice. Thus, B cell hyper-responsiveness to IL-5 is a characteristic of NZB/W mice but not of two other lupus-prone murine strains. As one unique feature of NZB/W mouse B cells compared to normal and other autoimmune B cells is an elevated proportion of Ly-1+ B cells, the possibility of IL-5 hyper-responsiveness being associated with this B cell subpopulation was investigated. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorted Ly-1+ and Ly-1- B cells both responded to IL-5, however Ly-1+ B cells consistently showed a higher stimulation index in both proliferative and Ig secretory responses to this lymphokine.\r"

  ".U": "89140342\r", 
  ".W": "IL-6/IFN-beta 2 is a family of phosphoglycoproteins ranging in size from 19 to 30 kDa which elicits a broad range of physiologic and immune responses. Several cytokines, including TNF, have been shown to stimulate IL-6 production in cell culture. In this report, we describe the rapid induction of circulating biologically active IL-6 by the systemic administration of rTNF to patients with cancer. Low levels of IL-6 activity could be detected in the sera of patients as early as 5 min after rTNF infusion. IL-6 levels peaked approximately 2 to 3 h after rTNF bolus administration and were undetectable in most cases within 8 h. IL-6 was detected in two separate bioassays--the hybridoma B9 proliferation and the hepatocyte-stimulating factor assay. Maximum detectable levels of IL-6 ranged from 160 to 310 hybridoma growth factor units and 11-82 ng/ml in the hepatocyte-stimulating factor assay. IL-6 induction decreased after serial, daily doses of rTNF. Serial serum samples of patients receiving IL-2 or IFN-alpha were also assayed for IL-6 production. IL-2-treated but not IFN-alpha-treated patients generated low levels of IL-6 (range less than 20 to 95 hybridoma growth factor units/ml). Interestingly, in patients treated with IL-2, serum levels of TNF were detectable and peak TNF activity preceded measurable IL-6 levels. Serum levels of acute phase plasma proteins and of corticosteroid rose in response to rTNF administration. C-reactive protein increased (2.5 to 4.0-fold) within 8 h of rTNF administration and cortisol levels rose (10- to 20-fold) within 4 h after rTNF injection. We conclude that rTNF administration in man leads to the induction of circulating IL-6 which, due to its broad range of activities, may be an important physiologic signal regulating the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of human rIL-4 to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated T cells directly as well as by increasing IL-2 production or enhancing IL-2 responsiveness was investigated. IL-4 augmented proliferation of T cells stimulated with PHA, Con A, immobilized mAb to the CD3 molecular complex (OKT3), or PMA. IL-4 increased the number of mitogen-stimulated cells entering the cell cycle as well as enhancing ongoing proliferation of mitogen-activated lymphoblasts. Facilitation of initial activation by IL-4 was not inhibited by mAb to the p55 component of the IL-2R, anti-Tac, and, therefore, was not dependent on endogenous IL-2 activity. However, IL-4-mediated enhancement of ongoing T cell proliferation stimulated by PHA or OKT3 was partially but not completely blocked by anti-Tac. Analysis of the supernatants from PHA-stimulated T cell cultures indicated that IL-4 increased the production of IL-2 by mitogen-activated cells. Moreover, IL-4 increased the amount of IL-2 mRNA that accumulated in mitogen-stimulated T cells. In addition, IL-4 markedly augmented IL-2R expression by PHA-stimulated T cells. Although IL-4 promoted ongoing DNA synthesis of mitogen-stimulated T cells in an IL-2-dependent manner, it was also able to sustain their proliferation directly. Thus, IL-4 supported proliferation of PMA-activated T cells in a manner that was not inhibited by anti-Tac. Furthermore, IL-4 could augment proliferation and IL-2R expression of T cells stimulated with PHA in the presence of cyclosporin A, which blocks endogenous cytokine production or anti-Tac. Finally, IL-4 was noted to enhance proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. The results indicate that IL-4 enhances proliferation of mitogen-activated human T cells by a number of mechanisms, including the direct promotion of cell cycle entry and subsequent DNA synthesis, enhanced production of IL-2, and increased responsiveness to IL-2 in part by up-regulation of IL-2R expression.\r"

In bone marrow-derived long term lymphoid cultures initiated in presence of IL-4, the majority of cells exhibited a more immature phenotype than is usually seen in lymphoid cells grown in Whitlock-Witte type cultures. This immature cell population, lacking the B220 Ag, was purified by cell sorting. When transferred to mixed stromal layers used in conventional lymphoid long term cultures, these cells differentiated into B lineage cells that could be identified by expression of the B220 Ag and surface IgM. Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell lines resulting from this immature cell population express a DJH rearrangement and contained RNA that hybridized with a VJ558 probe, suggesting transcription of germ-line V genes. A culture modification allowed selective proliferation of a non-transformed cell population with characteristics of very immature B lineage cells. The proliferation of these cells was supported by a homogeneous stromal cell line that was propagated with horse serum in presence of IL-4. The lymphoid cells proliferating under those culture conditions expressed the Ag detected by the BP-1 and 6C3 mAb and were Fc gamma RII and Ia-positive. However, more mature B cell markers were lacking. DNA analysis of these cell lines revealed JH rearrangement without evidence for deletion of any member of the DSP-2 family. These cell lines retained their immature phenotype after transfer to mixed stromal layers of Whitlock-Witte type. The mechanisms providing these unique culture conditions initiated by IL-4 in bone marrow stromal cells are discussed.\r"

The addition of IL-1 to monocytes caused changes in membrane Ag expression as assessed by flow cytometric analysis.

Data from 35S methionine pulse-chase experiments with the Fc epsilon R2 bearing human B lymphoblastoid cell line, RPMI 8866, and immunoprecipitations of cell lysates and culture supernatants with an Fc epsilon R2 specific mAb, mAb 25, demonstrates the existence of a cell-associated 28-kDa Fc epsilon R2 fragment. This fragment was shown by partial amino(NH2)-terminal sequence analysis to be identical to the previously described 28-kDa sFc epsilon R2. The resistance to cell treatment with trypsin indicated that it was located intracellularly. Its appearance early in the biosynthesis of the Fc epsilon R2 (within a 10-min pulse), before the Fc epsilon R2 reached the cell surface, suggested that some of this fragment was generated intracellularly. Neutralization of acidic organelles with NH4Cl inhibited the formation of this intracellular fragment, strongly suggesting that it was a produce of intracellular cleavage of the Fc epsilon R2. Finally, this 28-kDa intracellular fragment was shown to be released into the culture supernatant, suggesting an intracellular mechanism by which the cells generate sFc epsilon R2.\r"

  ".W": "An immediate consequence of Ag-specific activation of T cells is phosphorylation of the gamma-subunit of the CD3 gamma-chain. There is good evidence that the kinase that mediates CD3 gamma-chain phosphorylation is protein kinase C (pkC). It has also been proposed that the interaction between pkC and CD3 gamma-chains controls the cell surface expression of the antigen receptor/CD3 Ag complex. In the present study we present data relevant to these two points. Thus we show that CD3 gamma-subunit phosphorylation can be triggered by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. However, as judged by several criteria, ionomycin does not stimulate cellular pkC. Accordingly, ionomycin must regulate phosphorylation of the CD3 Ag by a kinase distinct from pkC. The phosphorylation of CD3 Ag induced by ionomycin is not accompanied by a modulation of the cell surface expression of CD3 molecules which implies that CD3 gamma-chain phosphorylation is not a sufficient signal for the endocytosis of the CD3/Ag receptor complex.\r"

After progressive purification by gel filtration and chromatofocusing, leukotriene release enhancing factor (LREF) gave a single band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to a Mr of 60 kDa and a isoelectric point of 5.0 to 5.2. Human T lymphocytes were identified as a source of LREF because a long term human CD4+ T cell line, specific for house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) generated leukotriene release enhancing activity (LREA) when stimulated with the inducing Ag together with irradiated accessory cells. Cultures of accessory cell and Ag alone did not induce neutrophil activation. Similarly, control cultures using an irrelevant allergen (grass pollen) failed to produce this activity. Stimulation of PBMC with anti-CD3 mAb also generated LREA. LREA had other neutrophil-associated biologic activities. These included the enhancement of neutrophil adherence to nylon wool, increased cytotoxicity of opsonised schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni and upregulation of C receptors (CR1 and CR3). LREA had minimal neutrophil chemotactic activity. Therefore, LREF has potential as a mediator of inflammation and provides a link between lipid mediators, neutrophils, and cell-mediated immunity in the context of allergic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Infections with a variety of viruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, vaccinia virus) stimulated C57BL/6 mice to generate allospecific CTL coincidental with the generation of virus-specific CTL. In C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, LCMV-induced CTL with reactivity against cells from mice bearing gene products of the d, f, k, p, q, and s but not the b MHC loci. Studies with congenic mouse strains indicated that the MHC loci coded for the target of the allospecific killer cells. The targets of the allospecific CTL were further identified as class I MHC Ag by three criteria: 1) target cells from congenic strains of mice differing from effector cells only in the expression of class I Ag were sensitive to lysis; 2) fibroblasts expressing low levels of class I Ag were resistant to lysis but were rendered sensitive after treatment with IFN-beta, which induced higher expression of class I Ag; and 3) antibody specific for class I Ag expressed on the target cell blocked killing. Studies with congenic mouse strains also suggested that the ability to generate high levels of the virus-induced allospecific killer cells was also under MHC regulation, as H-2b mice generated high levels and H-2k mice low levels of the allospecific CTL. Both C3H/St and C57BL/6 mice immunized against LCMV developed detectable LCMV-specific CTL when later challenged with either murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus, indicating that a virus infection can stimulate the reappearance of memory CTL. Cold target competition studies indicated no cross-reactivities between these viruses or allogeneic cells at the CTL level. Both the allospecific CTL and the reactivated LCMV-specific CTL were found in blast-size lymphocyte preparations. Spleen cells taken from LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice 5 days post-infection spontaneously generated into allospecific and virus-specific CTL after 2 days of culture. The generation of both was dependent on the presence of supernatant factors produced only in the presence of L3T4+ cells. These factors activated allospecific CTL in spleen cells from virus-primed mice but not from control mice. We suggest that lymphokines produced as a consequence of virus infection may act to stimulate the proliferation and activation of CTL not specific to the challenge virus, resulting in a virus-induced polyclonal CTL stimulation.\r"

Treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with phorbol diester tumor promoters decreases proliferation and induces differentiation. Among changes induced by phorbol diesters is decreased cell surface expression of TFR. To elucidate effects of phorbols on lymphocyte growth and differentiation, we examined TFR expression by measuring 125I-transferrin binding, levels of TFR mRNA by Northern analysis and dot-blot hybridization, and rates of TFR gene transcription by nuclear run-on experiments in CCRF-CEM lymphoblastoid T cells treated with PMA or phorbol dibutyrate. Cell surface expression of TFR was decreased 60 to 85% within 2 min of exposing cells to phorbols and remained decreased for 96 h. Steady state levels of TFR mRNA decreased to less than 30% of control after 48 h. After treating cells with actinomycin D, estimated TFR mRNA t 1/2 was 2.7 h and was unaltered in phorbol-treated cells. Levels of TFR mRNA were not affected by treatment of cells with cycloheximide in either control or phorbol-treated cells. Therefore, post transcriptional mRNA processing by protein factors did not account for decreased TFR mRNA in phorbol-treated cells. Compared to baseline levels, rates of TFR gene transcription in PMA-treated cells increased up to two-fold during the initial 6 h of culture, then decreased over the ensuing 12 h to less than 10% of baseline values. This pattern was not seen in control cultures. Therefore, regulation of TFR gene transcription is a consequence of treating CEM cells with phorbol diesters. Cell surface expression of TFR in phorbol-treated lymphoblastoid T cells may be mediated in part at the level of gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "YE1/48 is a murine cell surface disulphide-linked dimeric Ag consisting of two 45,000-50,000 Mr subunits. It is expressed on some T lymphoma lines at high levels but its expression on normal lymphocytes is very low. The functional significance of this Ag is currently unknown. We have now cloned a cDNA encoding the YE1/48. Sequence analysis revealed that it encodes a Type II membrane protein of 262 amino acids (30,500 MW), with 44 amino acids in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, 22 amino acids in the transmembrane domain and 196 amino acids in the C-terminal extracellular domain. There are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain all of which are probably used in the mature protein. No significant homology can be identified with other known protein sequences in the data base or with human CD28(T44), a human T cell activation antigen consisting of two 44,000 Mr subunits. The protein sequence includes in its extracellular domain the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide, a potential cell-adhesive binding site, and a sequence similar to the consensus domain of any metal-binding proteins. However, whether these sequences are functional is unknown. Genomic Southern analysis of C57BL/6, BALB/c and C3H mice has demonstrated a restriction fragment length polymorphism. The analysis has also strongly suggested the existence of some other genes with sequences highly homologous to the YE1/48 gene. The YE1/48 gene appears to be expressed at very low levels in a wide range of lymphoid cells with no restriction to their differentiation stages. Interestingly, YE1/48 expression appears to be induced in pre-B cells after transformation by Abelson virus, suggesting an association of YE1/48 expression with the transformation of T and pre-B Cells.\r"

After removal of the non-adherent lymphoid cells, plastic adherent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells could be efficiently expanded in the presence of IL-2. Plastic adherent-derived A-LAK cells were characterized by high rates of proliferation and their cytotoxic activity was more than 10 fold higher than LAK cells generated in the bulk (unfractionated) spleen cell cultures. A-LAK cells could be continuously generated from the non-adherent cell population. Using multiple transfers (every 1 to 2 days) of non-adherent LAK cells into new flasks, new rounds of plastic adherent cells were generated with high expansion capability and high levels of cytotoxic activity. Morphologically, A-LAK cells were large granular lymphocyte and phenotypically expressed markers characteristic of NK cells (asialo GM1+, NK1.1+, Qa5+, Ly-6.2+, Thy-1.2+, but negative for Lyt-2.2 and L3T4). A-LAK cells generated from mice of different strains expressing low and high levels of NK cell activity were equally highly cytotoxic. However, A-LAK cells obtained from nude or beige mice had relatively lower levels of cytotoxicity. Stimulation of NK cell activity by poly I:C or inhibition by in vivo or in vitro treatment with anti-asialo GM1 serum did not affect the generation of A-LAK cells. A-LAK cells derived from spleen or bone marrow of C57BL/6 or nude mice treated with anti-asialo GM1 serum were found to be asialo GM1+ suggesting that A-LAK cell could be generated from the asialo GM1- precursor cells. Expansion of plastic adherent A-LAK cells in the presence of IL-2 could provide large numbers of highly purified cytotoxic A-LAK cells suitable for cancer immunotherapy.\r"

Three different types of cloned effector cells were investigated: TCR-/CD3- NK cells, TCR-gamma delta+/CD3+ cells, and TCR-alpha beta+/CD3+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Effector cells showed differential levels of tumor cell colony inhibition, but no MHC-non-restricted lysis of normal HPC was observed. Pre-stimulation of normal HPC by culturing on established stromal layers had no effect. Cell-mediated lysis of HPC only occurred by Ag-specific MHC-restricted lysis by CTL, or by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In cell mixing experiments, irradiated tumor cells, but not normal bone marrow cells inhibited tumor cell lysis. Furthermore, cloned effector lymphocytes were able to specifically eliminate malignant cells from tumor contaminated bone marrow without damaging normal HPC. When fresh leukemic cells were used as targets, growth of acute myeloblastic leukemia colonies was inhibited after incubation with several cytotoxic effector clones, whereas chronic myeloid leukemia precursor cells showed limited sensitivity to MHC-non-restricted cytolysis. These results indicate that MHC-non-restricted cytolysis by NK cells is selectively directed against neoplastic cells and not against normal HPC.\r"

In the present study, we investigated whether ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induced circulating IL-1 in the plasma of patients undergoing chronic UVB therapy. In order to remove plasma proteins which inhibit IL-1-induced T-cell proliferation, each plasma sample was chromatographed and each fraction was assayed for IL-1 activity. There was no detectable IL-1 before and 1 h after UVB radiation; IL-1 appeared 4 h after treatment and was absent after 24 h. Plasma IL-1 was neutralized by antibodies to recombinant human IL-1 beta and alpha. The anti-IL-1 alpha, but not anti-IL-1 beta, antibodies partially neutralized the IL-1 activity present in a keratinocyte cell line supernate. These results demonstrate that UVB therapy induces circulating IL-1 and that this IL-1 may originate from both keratinocyte and non-keratinocyte sources.\r"

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that clobetasol propionate 0.05% applied twice daily for 7 d reduced the percentage of HLA-DR+T6+ LCs in EC suspensions to 46% of control (from a mean percentage +/- sem of 2.49 +/- 0.30 in control skin to 1.15 +/- 0.22 in steroid-treated skin), but did not significantly alter the relative amounts of HLA-DR and CD1a/T6 antigens per individual HLA-DR+T6+ cell. HLA-DR+T6- and HLA-DR-T6+ cells were not detected in either group. Steroid therapy significantly decreased the allostimulatory capacity of unsorted ECs. By contrast, in parallel experiments in which the same EC suspensions were greatly enriched (85% to 90%) for HLA-DR+T6+ LCs by flow cytometric sorting, the allostimulatory capacity of purified LCs from steroid-treated skin was not significantly different from control. Residual HLA-DR+T6+ LCs, which preserve their antigenic markers and alloantigen-presenting function, may be relatively unaffected because they have only recently immigrated into the epidermis, or they may represent a subgroup of steroid-resistant LCs. Alternatively, given the dose response relationship between topical steroid potency and decrease in HLA-DR+T6+ LC numbers, the apparent steroid resistance of residual HLA-DR+T6+ LCs may reflect heterogenity in the density of expression of LC steroid receptors.\r"

In this study, geometrically-precise biopsies (circles and rectangles) were excised from the dorsal skin of perinatal rats and placed in tissue culture media. The excised skin sections rapidly exhibited changes in shape (to ellipses and helices). These resulting conformations were characterized with regard to selected spatial attributes; i.e., the ratio of major to minor axes for elliptical figures and the \"winding number\" for helices. This simple methodological approach allowed the following conclusions: 1) skin retraction in the rat is anisotropic and is maximal in the rostral-caudal direction; 2) skin retraction is inversely related to postnatal age and to ambient temperature; 3) retraction is inhibited by in vivo treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as by metabolic poisons such as sodium azide; 4) retraction is augmented in vitro by calcium chloride. Overall, these data support the hypothesis of a metabolically active, temperature-dependent, anisotropically organized retractile mechanism in the dorsal skin of the perinatal rat.\r"

In this study, we investigated whether a commercially available water-resistant sunscreen, either SPF-6 or SPF-15, containing Padimate O (UVB absorber) and oxybenzone (UVA absorber), was effective in preventing systemic suppression of CHS induced by either FS36 sunlamp exposure or solar simulating radiation. We observed that these two sunscreen preparations were totally incapable of preventing the immunologic suppression of contact hypersensitivity by UV radiation. These results indicate that application of sunscreen does not retard the development of suppression of CHS following repeated UV exposure under conditions where erythema is not clinically observed. Thus, erythema may not be a good end point for assessing systemic immune suppression and its consequences.\r"

Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the effect of recombinant human TNF and LT on the oxidative metabolism of isolated human PMN. In addition ultrastructural changes upon stimulation were evaluated. For detection of granulocyte activation different assay systems were used: 1) lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (CL), 2) superoxide-dismutase (SOD) inhibitable cytochrome C-reduction (superoxide), 3) horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of phenol red (hydrogen peroxide), 4) release of myeloperoxidase, 5) ultrastructural detection of hydrogen peroxide-production, 6) scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). TNF at concentrations as low as 10(-3) U/ml induced a distinct CL response, whereas LT appeared to be less active. PMN preincubated with TNF or LT for 150 min were completely deactivated to renewed stimulation with TNF, LT, and with GM-CSF, but responded to other triggers of the oxidative burst. Moreover, stimulation with f-met-leu-phe resulted in an enhanced response after preincubation with TNF or LT. The CL response was significantly inhibited by SOD, but not by catalase, D-mannitol, and DMTU, suggesting that mainly .O2- is responsible for the CL signal. The effect on PMN could be completely blocked by antibodies to TNF. Significant release of reactive oxygen species upon stimulation with TNF was also demonstrated by cytochrome C reduction and by detection of H2O2 using functional and ultrastructural assays. Only minimal amounts of peroxidase were released. Activation of PMN could be visualized by SEM and TEM. After addition of TNF at concentrations as low as 10(-1) U/ml PMN adhered to the substratum and were typically polarized within 15 min. Stimulation with LT resulted in comparable results, but based on its biologic activity in the cytotoxicity assay LT, in comparison to TNF, was significantly less active. Based on the data presented LT and, particularly, TNF appear to be potent activators of PMN oxidative metabolism.\r"

Studies with cell lines, the conditioned media (CM), and recombinant interleukin (IL) 1, 2, and 3 revealed that BB5 cells were chemotactically attracted to a transformed keratinocyte cell line PAM212 and, to a lesser extent, to the CM from PAM212 and IL-2, but not to IL-1 and IL 3. These results suggest that epidermotropic T cells may be preferentially trapped in an area with a high concentration of keratinocyte-derived growth factors as well as IL-2.\r"

The peptides were used in ELISA tests for their reactivity with human antisera from HIV-1 positive individuals; patients with clinically manifested AIDS showed only a rather limited reaction, predominantly with two peptides (p102-112, p316-326), which is in contrast to sera from HIV-1 positive asymptomatic individuals, whose sera were reactive with almost all peptides. Using consecutive sera of the same patients, decreasing antibody titers to defined epitopes could be shown to occur during the development of AIDS. Cellular immune response recognition was analyzed in T-cell proliferation assays by [3H]thymidine incorporation. One peptide localized in a conserved region clearly induced proliferation of T-cells. Those data were combined to a map of the functions localized in the various regions of the HIV-1 envelope proteins.\r"

In addition, 86 HIV-1 seropositive and 39 HIV-1 seronegative drug abusers and 148 healthy controls were also studied. No significant differences in HLA antigen frequencies were found in comparison of HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative drug abusers with controls, suggesting that HLA polymorphism does not represent a genetic risk for infection with HIV-1. In contrast, a significant increased frequency of B35 (p less than 0.01) and CW4 (p less than 0.01) was observed in both groups of AIDS patients as compared to controls. Moreover, DR2 was increased in frequency in patients with opportunistic infections (p less than 0.01) and DR3 was completely absent in patients with secondary cancers (p less than 0.05). In the latter group, the DR5 frequency was increased, although nonsignificantly. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of HLA-linked factors of susceptibility and host resistance to AIDS.\r"

They may be counseled by physicians who introduce into the decision-making process their personal fear of contagion, uncertainty about potential therapeutic benefits of surgery for people with HIVD, and anecdotal impressions that the immunodeficiency of HIVD might be accelerated by surgical and anesthetic interventions. However, there are no studies that have investigated immunomodulating effects of surgery and anesthesia in people with HIVD. Also, clinical studies of surgical interventions in populations of people with HIVD do not clearly demonstrate adverse outcomes attributable to surgery alone. Review of immunomodulating effects of surgical procedures in populations of people without HIVD reveals that multiple alterations of immune parameters may occur in response to all phases of anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative recovery. These alterations often depend upon the type of anesthesia used and the degree of surgical trauma. Most notably, the alterations are transient and rarely correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. These facts mitigate against the current preconceived notion that surgery will superimpose a sustained and clinically significant detriment to the immunologic competence of people with HIVD. A proposal for rational exploration and study of this issue is presented.\r"

The three groups were 37 HIV seroconverters, 304 prevalent HIV seropositives remaining free of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 69 men who developed AIDS during observation. Six months before seroconversion, CD4 levels were similar among HIV seroconverters and 356 seronegative controls. Within 18 months of seroconversion, mean CD4 levels fell to the level of the prevalent seropositives at study entry. From there, the rate of decline slowed. CD8 lymphocyte counts rose dramatically at seroconversion. Among AIDS-free prevalent seropositives, CD4 levels fell steadily over 36 months of observation. By contrast, CD8 cell levels rose slowly. Among men who developed AIDS, mean CD4 levels fell more rapidly again during the 18 months prior to diagnosis. CD8 cell levels remained elevated until 6-12 months before diagnosis, when they began to fall.\r"

  ".W": "Serum neopterin is a metabolite of dihydroneopterin triphosphate, which is produced from GTP during immune activation. A study was undertaken in homosexual male subjects followed at 6 month intervals for 3 or more years to determine the value of serum neopterin changes induced by HIV infection. The significance of serum neopterin levels in evaluating prognosis of HIV-infected individuals was also assessed. Serum neopterin was found to be a useful indicator of the presence of HIV infection. Stratification of 29 HIV seroconverters showed a strong inverse correlation between the serum neopterin rise and the blood CD4 T cell fall in the first year following HIV infection. Thus, a small increase in neopterin (less than 5 nmol/L) at the time of HIV seroconversion was associated with minimal CD4 T cell reduction and a large increase (greater than 12 nmol/L) was associated with a much greater CD4 T cell fall. Neopterin levels were markedly different (lower) in individuals with little or no CD4 T cell fall when compared with those with moderate or marked rates of T cell fall. This relationship between serum neopterin and the CD4 T cell level was further confirmed by an evaluation of both parameters in a group of 799 seropositive homosexual men. In this analysis, serum neopterin was shown to have a significant predictive value for the development of AIDS within 3 years. Furthermore, when serum neopterin and CD4 T cell measurements were considered together, the prognostic value of the combination was significantly greater than either alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the role of endogenous gonadal steroids in the regulation of D1 receptor function after chronic treatment with sulpiride, a D2 specific antagonist. Chronic sulpiride treatment induced a desensitization of striatal D1 receptor-simulated adenylate cyclase activity in intact male rats with no change in the number of D1 or D2 receptors. This desensitization of D1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was expressed as a decrease in Vmax with no change in the activation constant. Castration of male rats blocked the chronic sulpiride-induced desensitization of D1 receptor function. Castration of male rats also resulted in a decrease in the number of D1 receptors as measured by [3H]SCH23390 binding. Ovariectomy of female rats had no effect on striatal D1 receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Preliminary studies showed no effect of chronic sulpiride treatment on D1 receptor function in intact or ovariectomized female rats. We conclude that testicular hormones have a permissive effect on the expression of the chronic sulpiride-induced desensitization of D1 receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "Piperine as well as capsaicin showed positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in the isolated spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria of rats, respectively. The responses to piperine were not affected by the presence of the antagonists to norepinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin. However, once the tissue was pretreated with piperine or capsaicin, the response to subsequent application of piperine was reduced significantly. Both positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of capsaicin were also attenuated after the tissue was treated with piperine or capsaicin. Thus, not only a tachyphylaxis to either piperine or capsaicin itself but also a cross-tachyphylaxis between piperine and capsaicin developed. Nonadrenergic noncholinergic calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like immunoreactive nerves were distributed in the muscle layers of both atria. CGRP-like immunoreactivity was depleted considerably by treatment of the tissue with piperine or capsaicin. When endogenous CGRP was depleted, although the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of piperine and capsaicin were abolished, the effects of CGRP and isoproterenol were not affected. These results indicate that both piperine and capsaicin cause positive chronotropic and inotropic responses by releasing CGRP from nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerves, and that the development of cross-tachyphylaxis between piperine and capsaicin is due to the depletion of endogenous CGRP.\r"

These cultures, which contained 0.5 to 1% dopaminergic neurons, were a suitable tool for determining nonselective and selective dopaminergic cytotoxicity. Selective toxicity was quantitated as the concentration which destroyed half of the population of dopaminergic neurons as visualized by tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry. Nonselective toxicity was defined as the concentration of test drug which destroyed half of the entire population of cultured cells as visualized by phase contrast microscopy. The compounds tested were selected to fulfill two molecular criteria underlying the toxic activity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine toward dopaminergic cells: 1) to be a substrate for the selective uptake system of the dopaminergic neurons and 2) to possess a delocalized positive charge related to their ability to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport. Of a total number of 29 compounds tested, MPP+ and its close derivatives, 2'-methyl-MPP+ and p-amino-MPP+, exhibited highly selective dopaminergic toxicity, hence the requirements for a selective dopaminergic neurotoxin are rather strict.\r"

The CPS, with its large sample size, provides a unique opportunity to examine region, division, and state estimates of smoking prevalence. The overall prevalence rate for males in the 1985 CPS was estimated at 31.3%, compared with 25.0% for females. For males, smoking rates were highest in the South (34.5%) and lowest in the West (28.0%). For females, smoking rates were highest in the North Central region (26.3%) and lowest in the West (22.7%). Among males, blacks reported higher smoking rates (37.2%) than whites (30.7%) or Hispanics (30.9%). In contrast, white females (25.8%) and black females (26.0%) reported virtually identical smoking rates, while Hispanic females reported a considerably lower rate (16.5%). White-collar workers (both males and females) also reported substantially lower smoking rates than service or blue-collar workers. For both males and females, peak smoking prevalence occurred in the 40-49-year age group (males = 38.1%, females = 30.6%).\r"

We investigated the temporal relationship between serum and urine corticosteroid levels, the number of circulating B cells, serum immunoglobulin levels, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions in the postburn period. Fifteen adult patients (mean age, 44 years) admitted with thermal burns greater than 20% body surface area (BSA) (mean, 50%) were evaluated during four postburn periods. Using a bacterial adherence assay in blood smears, we observed an increased percentage of B lymphocytes (20.3%) in the early postburn period compared to normal controls obtained during the same time period (13.1%). The percentage of B cells gradually decreased during the subsequent 4 weeks and was not influenced by the eventual clinical outcome. The changes in B-cell percentage were paralleled by changes in the level of urine 17-hydroxysteroids. Serum IgG concentrations were low during the initial postburn period in survivors and nonsurvivors and returned to normal and above-normal levels in the late postburn period in both groups. The delayed hypersensitivity skin test reactions were also depressed in the immediate postburn period and returned to normal only in the surviving group at the end of the second postburn week. We speculate that the increased endogenous secretion of stress hormones results in an increase in circulating B cells secondary to their release from lymphoid organs and that the normalization of hormone levels as wound healing ensued was associated with the return of B cells to the lymphoid organs. This lymphocyte redistribution may result in polyclonal cellular interactions, with subsequent B-cell activation, and increased IgG production.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic administration of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells is a new approach to the immunotherapy of advanced cancer. Metastatic renal cell cancer is one of the histological types of tumors particularly susceptible to this treatment approach although renal toxicity often is a dose-limiting side effect. We compared the renal functional changes observed during interleukin-2 therapy in 52 consecutive patients with advanced renal cancer to that of 83 consecutive patients with metastatic nonrenal cancer. Of the 52 patients with renal cancer 41 had recently undergone nephrectomy. The over-all peak serum creatinine values and the percentage increase of serum creatinine over baseline for all patients studied were significantly higher in cycle 2 of interleukin-2 therapy than in cycle 1: 3.8 +/- 0.2 versus 2.6 +/- 0.1 mg. per dl. and 241.7 +/- 16.5 versus 140.3 +/- 11.0 per cent, respectively. In patients with pre-therapy serum creatinine values of 0.4 to 0.9 mg. per dl. there were no significant differences in the mean peak serum creatinine nor in the percentage increase over baseline between renal and nonrenal cancer patients during cycle 1. In cycle 2 of therapy these values were higher in the renal cancer group (3.6 +/- 0.8 versus 2.4 +/- 0.2 mg. per dl. and 310.4 +/- 103.5 versus 214 +/- 30.4 per cent, respectively) but they did not reach statistical significance (P2 = 0.08 and 0.25, respectively). Renal and nonrenal cancer patients with pre-therapy serum creatinine levels of 1.0 to 1.4 mg. per dl. achieved similar high values in cycle 2 of interleukin-2 therapy (3.9 +/- 0.3 versus 3.9 +/- 0.4 mg. per dl. and 222.7 +/- 23.2 versus 248.7 +/- 33.5 per cent, respectively), although the initial increase (cycle 1) was higher in the renal cancer patients (3.3 +/- 0.3 versus 2.4 +/- 0.2 mg. per dl. and 172.3 +/- 25.9 versus 116.1 +/- 18.0 per cent, respectively). Baseline serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg. per dl. was associated with an over-all higher peak serum creatinine and higher percentage increase of serum creatinine over baseline than that below 1.5 mg. per dl. baseline: 4.4 mg.per dl. and 171.1 +/- 36.3 per cent in cycle 1 and 6.5 +/- 0.7 mg. per dl. and 296.1 +/- 44.0 per cent in cycle 2, respectively (p less than 0.01). There was no association between peak serum creatinine and interval from nephrectomy to interleukin-2 therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor receptors were measured in biopsies from patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer. Two methods to detect these receptors were compared: immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections, and a ligand binding study using radiolabeled epidermal growth factor and tumor cell membranes. We studied 101 patients by immunohistochemistry and 47 patients by both methods. An association was found between immunohistochemical positivity for epidermal growth factor receptors and high tumor stage (p less than 0.001). Thus, most of the muscle invasive tumors were positive (35 of 49, 71 per cent) and more stage pT1 tumors were positive (8 of 18, 44 per cent) than were stage pTa tumors (5 of 34, 15 per cent, p less than 0.05). The ligand binding study was slightly more sensitive in detecting receptors than immunohistochemistry (30 of 47, 64 per cent and 25 of 47, 53 per cent, respectively). Greater amounts of receptors were found in muscle invasive tumors compared to tumors not invading muscle (p less than 0.05). A significant association was found between the 2 methods in the detection of receptors (p less than 0.001) and no discrepancies were found between the 2 methods in tumors containing high levels of receptors. Immunohistochemistry provides a satisfactory method to detect receptors in tumors with high levels of receptors, although ligand binding is more sensitive in tumors with low levels of receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Whether the pathogenesis of polymorphic reticulosis is from T cells, B cells, or histiocytes has been controversial. In this study, the Southern blot hybridization technique was used to analyze immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and to perform the conventional surface marker analysis in two patients with polymorphic reticulosis. The immunophenotype demonstrated the presence of predominantly mature, activated T-lymphocytes, minimal B-cells, and no natural killer cells or monocytes/granulocytes. The mature T-cell phenotype could be due to either inflammatory infiltrates or neoplastic cells of peripheral T-cell type, because the two coexist in polymorphic reticulosis tumors. The value of surface marker examination is limited in the analysis of PMR tumors. However, genetic analysis revealed that only Ig genes were rearranged, with no rearrangement of the TCR beta gene. Rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes occurs in B-lineage lymphoid neoplasms and is thought to be a criterion for diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms. Based on genetic analysis and clinicopathologic information, this study concluded that polymorphic reticulosis is a malignant lymphoma of B-cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "Peptides that are antigenic for T lymphocytes are ligands for two receptors, the class I or II glycoproteins that are encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex, and the idiotypic alpha/beta chain T-cell antigen receptor. That a peptide must bind to an MHC molecule to interact with a T-cell antigen receptor is the molecular basis of the MHC restriction of antigen-recognition by T lymphocytes. In such a trimolecular interaction the amino-acid sequence of the peptide must specify the contact with both receptors: agretope residues bind to the MHC receptor and epitope residues bind to the T-cell antigen receptor. From a compilation of known antigenic peptides, two algorithms have been proposed to predict antigenic sites in proteins. One algorithm uses linear motifs in the sequence, whereas the other considers peptide conformation and predicts antigenicity for amphipathic alpha-helices. We report here that a systematic delimitation of an antigenic site precisely identifies a predicted pentapeptide motif as the minimal antigenic determinant presented by a class I MHC molecule and recognized by a cytolytic T lymphocyte clone.\r"

Short synthetic peptides, which are able to associate directly with target cells, may substitute for these processed fragments in stimulating antigen-specific CTL responses. Using this approach, a dominant HLA-A2-restricted epitope has previously been mapped to residues 58-68 of influenza A virus matrix protein. Here we report HLA-A2-restricted CTL which are also able to recognize this short synthetic peptide in association with HLA-Aw69, but which fail to recognize HLA-Aw69 expressing cells infected with influenza A virus. Furthermore, individuals possessing HLA-Aw69 who respond to influenza A virus, do not respond to M58-68. These results imply that the low response to this epitope on infection of HLA-Aw69 individuals with influenza A is due to failure of the naturally processed product of matrix protein to associate with Aw69.\r"

  ".U": "89143768\r", 
  ".W": "Almost 30 years ago Burnet proposed that the immune system maintained self-tolerance by deleting autoreactive lymphocytes. Recently it has become clear that for T cells this step occurs in the thymus, where developing T cells first express their antigen-specific receptors. Here a T-cell which encounters its antigen disappears--if it is not dead, it at least stops expressing its receptors. In the periphery by contrast, encounter with antigen leads to activation and proliferation of the responding T-cell. There are two possible explanations for this difference. Either the antigen-presenting cells in the thymus are different from those in the periphery and instead of producing positive signals they directly or indirectly kill the thymocytes; or the T cells themselves are different, and like immature B cells, may die after encounter with antigen. We tested the first possibility and found that dendritic cells from spleen, which are the most potent activators of mature T cells, are also the most potent inactivators of young developing T cells. Thus it is not the antigen-presenting cell which determines whether a T-cell responds or dies, but the T-cell itself or its thymic environment.\r"

Controlled differential thermocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion and/or retrogasserian rootlets was performed in 533 patients; glycerolization of the trigeminal cistern in 32; and compression of the gasserian ganglion by balloon catheter in 159. Results and complications of each procedure are assessed at a mean follow-up of 6.5 years for thermocoagulation, 5 years for glycerolization, and 3.5 years for compression. The following therapeutic protocol is proposed: 1) in TN patients at first operation: a) gasserian compression (or glycerolization, if experience warrants it) is indicated in all cases of typical TN, unless the 3rd division alone is affected; b) in the latter case and in symptomatic TN, we suggest thermocoagulation; 2) in recurrences: a) after glycerolization or gasserian compression, gasserian compression (or glycerolization) is indicated; b) after thermocoagulation or open surgery, thermocoagulation is suggested.\r"

The inflammation was observed 2 to 10 months after surgery and occurred after laser posterior capsulotomy in four cases. Clinically, it appeared as a chronic iridocyclitis characterized by granulomatous-appearing keratic precipitates (5 cases), hypopyon (10 cases), and a white plaque on the posterior capsule or intraocular lens (IOL) implant (8 cases). Response to corticosteroid treatment was transient. Surgical intervention was required between 1 and 16 months after the inflammation began and included removal of the IOL and capsular bag via the limbus in 7 cases and pars plana vitrectomy in 11. Intravitreal antibiotics were administered in 12 cases. Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to count fingers, with 11 of 16 patients recovering visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Propionibacterium-associated endophthalmitis should be suspected if chronic indolent intraocular inflammation develops after ECCE. Intraocular specimens should be obtained and submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture and cytologic/histopathologic studies. Based on the clinical courses of these patients, recommendations for management are discussed.\r"

All patients received intravitreal antibiotics as part of their treatment regimen. Culture-negative patients generally responded well to a single intravitreal antibiotic injection. Five of seven (71.4%) culture-positive patients who were treated with a single intravitreal antibiotic injection and no vitrectomy suffered either a recurrence of their infection or did not respond to treatment. Four of five patients who received a vitrectomy in addition to a single intravitreal antibiotic injection were cured of their infections; the one patient who received repeated intravitreal antibiotic injections alone and all six patients who received repeated intravitreal antibiotic injections in combination with vitrectomy were cured of their infections. Although the intravitreal injection of antibiotics provides an extremely high initial level of antibiotics inside the eye, a single intravitreal antibiotic injection may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. In culture-negative cases, a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics appears to be sufficient treatment. In culture-positive cases, a higher cure rate is achieved with an aggressive approach which includes the use of repeated intravitreal antibiotic injections and/or vitrectomy.\r"

In the present study, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of CHX against type 1 HSV (HSV-1) infection. CHX moderately, but significantly, inhibited the replication and cytolytic activity of HSV-1 in Vero cell monolayers. When 0.2% CHX was applied topically onto the HSV-1 infected forehead skin of mice, the development of viral lesions and the viral titers in the skin and trigeminal ganglia were also moderately reduced. These data indicate that CHX oral rinse may be beneficial for the control of intraoral HSV-1 infection in certain patients, and warrants further controlled clinical study.\r"

In controls, TENS gave rise to a miosis which was slow in onset and long-lasting in duration, and which was comparable to that mediated by tachykinins in animals. A similar miotic response was bilaterally observed in migraine patients and in CH patients examined during the inactive phase. In CH sufferers during the cluster period, TENS only elicited a normal pupillary constriction in the asymptomatic eye, whereas the resulting response in the symptomatic eye was markedly decreased. Although the exact mechanism underlying the dysfunction remains to be clarified, these results seem to indicate that ocular trigeminal pathways are involved in CH.\r"

Among this sample, 52 (4.6%) patients had specimens that contained cocaine and/or metabolite. Fifteen specimens contained ethanol, a benzodiazepine, or a narcotic in addition to cocaine. Four patients were neonates, whereas three were infants from 1 to 7 months of age. The remaining 45 patients were adolescents with a mean age of 19 years. Among the adolescents, 11 had a significant chronic illness. In 19 patients (37%), cocaine exposure was unsuspected until the results of testing for toxic substances were known. The reasons for hospital evaluation included depression/attempted suicide in 19 patients, seizure in five, chest pain in 5, motor vehicle accident in three, syncope in three, abdominal pain in two, pneumomediastinum in two, accidental self-immolation in one, and apnea in one. Twenty patients required medical hospitalization for a total of 268 patient-days. One patient, a neonate, died. There is a striking prevalence of cocaine exposure in the pediatric age group. Among adolescents, this exposure may occur despite the presence of chronic illness. Although the age distribution appears bimodal, infants and young children may also have unsuspected exposure to this toxin. Greater awareness of cocaine exposure in childhood will be needed by primary and tertiary care pediatricians to identify affected children and provide appropriate intervention.\r"

  ".W": "A measles outbreak in an inner-city area primarily involved preschool-aged children younger than 5 years of age. The reasons why 31 unvaccinated preschool children with measles disease had not been vaccinated were investigated. For some patients, health care providers missed opportunities to vaccinate eligible patients against measles. Of the 26 patients whose full immunization status was known, ten (38%) were vaccinated with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine and/or oral poliovirus vaccine at a time when they could have received measles vaccine simultaneously, according to recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics. In addition, five of ten health care providers interviewed missed at least one opportunity to administer measles vaccine because of a minor illness that was not a contraindication to vaccination. Unvaccinated patients were more likely to receive health care in the public sector, have single mothers, and have parents who had no knowledge of existing vaccines; they were less likely to be age-appropriately immunized with other antigens. If measles immunization levels among preschool children in the United States are to be increased, education of both health care providers and parents, coupled with innovative strategies targeted to preschool children, particularly of low socioeconomic groups in inner cities, are needed.\r"

In CD4+ cells, 30- to 50-fold more virus was produced over the course of 18-20 days with cultures infected with F- compared to F+ virus. In CD4- cell lines, 2- to 10-fold greater virus production was found from cultures transfected with pHIV F- than those transfected with pHIV F+. The negative regulatory effects of nef on pHIV F- could be supplied in trans with a plasmid expressing only the nef gene product. Virus produced by COS-1 cells transfected with pHIV F- or pHIV F+ showed similar binding, uptake, uncoating, and reverse transcription. Analysis of HIV-1 RNA and structural protein levels and rates of viral RNA synthesis in CD4- cells also showed 2- to 10-fold higher levels in cells transfected with pHIV F- compared to pHIV F+. The activity of a HIV-1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid was also suppressed by nef, whereas other CAT plasmids were unaffected. These findings demonstrate that nef acts as a specific silencer of HIV-1 transcription. This activity may be critical for maintenance of HIV-1 latency in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The osteocalcin gene encodes a 6-kDa polypeptide, which represents one of the most abundant noncollagenous bone proteins, and the present studies establish that osteocalcin mRNA is detected only in bone tissue. An osteocalcin gene was isolated from a rat genomic DNA library, and sequence analysis indicated that the mRNA is represented in a 953-nucleotide segment of DNA consisting of four exons and three introns. A modular organization of the 5' flanking sequences of the gene is reflected by the presence of at least three classes of regulatory elements, which include the following: (i) RNA polymerase II canonical sequences; (ii) a series of consensus sequences for hormone receptor binding sites and cyclic nucleotide responsive elements consistent with physiologic expression of the osteocalcin gene; and (iii) a 24-nucleotide sequence in the proximal promoter region with a CAAT motif as a central element. We have designated this highly conserved sequence as an \"osteocalcin box\" since only 2 nucleotide substitutions are found in the rat and human osteocalcin genes. We have demonstrated two factors regulating osteocalcin gene expression. First, a 200-fold increase occurs in normal fetal calvaria osteoblasts producing a mineralizing matrix, compared to confluent osteoblasts in a nonmineralizing matrix. Second, contained within the 600 nucleotides immediately upstream from the transcription start site are sequences that support a 10-fold stimulated transcription of the gene by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\r"

  ".W": "The sensory dark current of vertebrate retinal rods is believed to be controlled by light activation of a chain of coupled biochemical cycles that finally regulate the cationic conductance of the plasma membrane by hydrolytically reducing the level of cGMP in rod outer segment cytoplasm. The scheme has been tested by measuring heat production by live frog retinas when stimulated with sequences of light flashes of progressively increasing energy. Using pyroelectric poly(vinylidene 1,1-difluoride) detectors that simultaneously measure transretinal voltage and retinal temperature change, four heat effects assignable to known biochemical cycles in rods have been found. As the dark current shuts down after a flash causing 180-1800 rhodopsin photoisomerizations per rod, a heat burst, q1, raises the retinal temperature 1-2 microK. q1 is closely regulated in size and slightly precedes dark current shutdown. Isobutylmethylxanthine slows and enlarges q1, delaying the dark-current response. Increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ stops the dark current without affecting q1. Although rod heat production is consistent with splitting of 1-3 microM of free cytoplasmic cGMP during transduction, the kinetics of the two processes do not match the predictions of current cGMP control models.\r"

Surface IL-1R levels are less than 2000 receptors per cell in postconfluent cultures but increase 9- to 20-fold 24 hr after treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 10 ng/ml or after raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 2 mM. This induction of surface IL-1R can be blocked by the addition of retinoic acid and parallels induction of squamous differentiation markers. These results imply that IL-1R levels may be related to the degree of differentiation of these cells. In parallel studies IL-1 protein levels were determined by bioassay and by Western blotting (immunoblots). All detectable IL-1 protein and essentially all IL-1 activity was cell-associated. Although constitutive levels of IL-1 biological activity and protein are significant in these cultures, IL-1 levels increase when either PMA or retinoic acid alone are added to cultures. IL-1 does not increase when PMA and retinoic acid are added simultaneously to cultures; nor is it induced when extracellular Ca2+ concentrations are raised to 2 mM. Thus, cell-associated IL-1 levels do not necessarily parallel surface IL-1R levels in these cultures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL-1 and surface IL-1R levels are differentially and complexly regulated in keratinocyte cultures. Possible implications of these results in terms of normal and abnormal regulation of proliferation and differentiation are discussed.\r"

Using the highly sensitive reporter gene luciferase, we have shown that this mutant can generate recombinant viruses that infect cultured cells and animals with normal vaccinia virus tropism. Insertion of the envelope and gag genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 into the attenuated vaccinia mutant resulted in their efficient expression and precursor processing in infected cultured cells. Infection of mice with human immunodeficiency virus-vaccinia recombinant viruses elicited human immunodeficiency virus-specific antibodies. Using mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide as a model for immunosuppression, the reduced virulence of the mutant recombinant virus was clearly evident. These findings demonstrate that the highly attenuated vaccinia virus mutant 48-7 can be used to generate effective and safer vaccines.\r"

Proteins were electrically blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and a band of the cytotoxic protein was excised after staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Direct analysis of the amino acid sequence of this protein showed the primary structure of its N-terminal region was identical to that of natural tumor necrosis factor type beta (TNF-beta). The 24-kDa molecular mass of the cytotoxic protein, determined by NaDodSO4/PAGE, and its elution profiles from various types of columns correlated with those of natural TNF-beta. Specific activity of the cytotoxicity, standardized with recombinant TNF-beta, was comparable to that of the purified factor. However, polyclonal antiserum to recombinant TNF-beta failed to react with the purified factor. Since recombinant TNF-beta, when used in patients, causes unacceptable side effects, which may be due to absence of glycosylation, the cell line K160b could be a useful source of natural TNF-beta for clinical trials.\r"

We administered human rF.VIIa to hemophilic and von Willebrand disease (vWD) dogs to determine its hemostatic effectiveness and survival in the circulation. Hemophilia A dogs lacking factor VIII demonstrated an immediate increase in plasma rF. VIIa and prompt stoppage of hemorrhage at bleeding time (BT) sites. In seven studies in two dogs, the range of dose of rF. VIIa was 50-220 micrograms/kg, with an apparent 7- to 11-fold increase in plasma factor VII and a mean recovery in plasma of 34%. The t1/2 was 2.8 +/- 0.5 hr. The BT was normalized except in an animal given the minimum dose. In four studies in two hemophilia B dogs lacking factor IX, BT was normalized. The elevation in plasma factor VII was by a factor of 8-30, with a mean recovery of rF.VIIa in plasma of 44%. In two studies in a homozygous vWD dog lacking von Willebrand factor, which is needed for platelet function, BT was not corrected even though large doses of rF. VIIa were given. The human rF. VIIa protein was immunogenic for dogs. These studies indicate that factor VIIa corrects the hemostatic defect in dogs with hemophilia A and B, diseases primarily of the intrinsic clotting system, but does not correct the hemostatic defect in vWD.\r"

The fluid microsphere model was used to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF). Normal subjects were scanned twice, 1 week apart, to determine the reproducibility of the CBF estimates. Hemispheric blood flow (hCBF) was calculated as the mean of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) values in 16 gray matter regions per hemisphere. In normal subjects mean hCBF was 68 ml/100 g/min. The highest rCBF was found in the occipital cortex, followed by the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortexes. CBF values were reproducible (p less than 0.001 except the right thalamic region, where p less than 0.01). Intraindividual variation ranged between 0.3% and 15%. Women exhibited significantly higher (16%, p less than 0.02) CBF than men. Patients were subdivided into groups with reversible (n = 19) and persistent (n = 10) symptoms. Significant hCBF differences between the affected and the contralateral hemispheres were recorded only in the group with reversible symptoms (p less than 0.005), whereas the group with persistent symptoms showed a significant bilateral decrease of hCBF compared with normal subjects and patients with reversible symptoms. Focal CBF was significantly lower in patients with completed stroke than in patients with transient symptoms (p less than 0.001). Our results indicate that IMP-SPECT can be used for the routine estimation of CBF in normal and pathologic states.\r"

The mean intraoperative blood loss was 1.6 +/- 1.1 L (SD), and patients received 4 +/- 5 units of blood perioperatively. Utilizing the described techniques, FG was effective in achieving hemostasis and sealing ureteral suture lines against leakage in all cases. There were no cases of renal infection, rebleeding, urinary fistulas, delayed rupture, stone formation, or urinary tract obstruction. Two patients underwent re-exploration for causes unrelated to their renal or ureteral injuries. The use of FG was associated with less reliance on suture redundancy to achieve parenchymal hemostasis and perform ureteral anastomoses. FG sealing of renal and ureteral injuries is a safe and effective technique for controlling hemorrhage and sealing anastomoses.

Because of severe mitral stenosis all patients received a heterograft in the mitral position and underwent reconstructive tricuspid surgery with Carpentier rings. With regard to postoperative clinical outcome three patient groups were distinguished: 37 patients (group A) showed clear clinical improvement; in seven patients mild, and in three patients moderate tricuspid regurgitation persisted. A mild tricuspid stenosis of less than 4 mm Hg mean diastolic gradient was found in 11 patients. Patients in group B (n = 8) showed no clinical improvement, but there was persistence of moderate tricuspid regurgitation associated with nearly unchanged pulmonary hypertension in five patients and moderate tricuspid stenosis in two. Six patients (group C) showed deterioration of their clinical status; in two patients a severe degree of tricuspid regurgitation persisted, and four patients were first seen with a tricuspid stenosis with a mean diastolic gradient greater than 7 mm Hg. Analysis of postoperative data showed that tricuspid stenosis may develop during surgery in patients with slightly shrunken valve leaflets. Although the area of the anterior tricuspid leaflet was slightly underestimated, we found that long-term results of tricuspid valve annuloplasty with a Carpentier ring were encouraging. Doppler echocardiography for detection of tricuspid regurgitation and transvalvular pressure gradient showed results identical to hemodynamic data and is a suitable and sensitive method for evaluating postoperative results after tricuspid valve annuloplasty.\r"

From the computer database of the echocardiography laboratory of the hospital, 7209 records containing results of both two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examinations were identified, from which 867 (12%) with no structural abnormality on two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained for analysis. Of these 867 records, 291 (34%) had evidence of regurgitation by Doppler technique in at least one cardiac valve. Mitral regurgitation was found in 167 (19%), tricuspid regurgitation in 151 (17%), pulmonic regurgitation in 45 (5%), and aortic regurgitation in 29 records (3%). Regurgitation of just one valve was the most common and occurred in 207 records (24%). This was followed by regurgitation of two valves (69 records, 8%), three valves (13 records, 2%), and four valves (two records, 0.2%). The prevalence of mitral, tricuspid, and aortic regurgitation was found to increase significantly with increasing age, as was the prevalence of regurgitation involving multiple valves. In 98% and 95% of mitral and tricuspid regurgitations, respectively, the jets were confined to the proximal one fourth of the atria, suggesting only trivial or mild regurgitation. Thus valvular regurgitation occurs not uncommonly in patients with structurally normal hearts referred for echocardiographic evaluation. These findings caution against the inappropriate diagnosis of clinical disease in the many patients who fall into this category. The increasing prevalence of valvular regurgitation with increasing age suggests that a wear-and-tear phenomenon rather than a congenital cause is involved in most instances.\r"

In 108 patients the ECG abnormalities were present at the time of admission. In the remaining 72 patients they developed shortly thereafter. The difference between these two groups was a longer duration of anginal complaints in the former (mean 2.3 days). Results of coronary angiography, performed a mean of 4.6 days after the last attack of chest pain, showed 50% or more narrowing in the proximal LAD in all patients. Thirty-three patients had complete occlusion of the LAD and 75 had collateral circulation to the LAD. Results of left ventricular angiography showed abnormal systolic left ventricular wall motion in 137 patients and normal systolic motion in the remaining 43 patients. The difference between these two groups was a shorter mean time interval between the last attack of chest pain and angiography in the former group (p less than 0.001). Twenty-four patients had only abnormal diastolic wall motion. Twenty-one patients had a small increase in the creatine kinase level at the time of admission. Fifteen patients (nine before and six during early revascularization) had an anterior wall myocardial infarction in the hospital; these patients had a patent but severely narrowed LAD and a low incidence of collateral circulation to the LAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred forty-eight consecutive patients were evaluated during 1985 and 1986 for the development of complete atrioventricular (AV) block after coronary artery bypass grafting. Cold (4 degrees) asanguineous potassium cardioplegia with temperature monitoring was used uniformly. AV block developed in 56 instances (16%). In 32 patients (group 1) the block was transient (less than 6 hours) and in 24 it was persistent (group 2). Left main coronary artery stenosis in conjunction with total obstruction of a dominant right coronary artery occurred more commonly in patients manifesting AV block (18 of 56, 32%) than in those without it (35 of 292, 12%) (p less than 0.05). Complete occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery was observed with equal frequency in patients with and without AV block. The presence of an ungraftable right coronary artery, however, was significantly more frequent in the AV block group: 16 of 37 (47%) vs 6 of 194 (3%) (p less than 0.01). Endarterectomy of the right coronary artery was performed in 8 of 24 patients (33%) with persistent AV block versus none in the patients with transient AV block (n = 32) or normal sinus rhythm postoperatively (n = 292) (p less than 0.0001). Persistent AV block (greater than 6 hours) was associated with myocardial infarction in 6 patients (25%) (p less than 0.05) and with low cardiac output in 18 patients (75%) (p less than 0.0001). In conclusion, AV block after myocardial revascularization was frequently associated with the presence of multivessel coronary disease and an ungraftable dominant right coronary artery. Persistent (greater than 6 hours) AV block was correlated with both perioperative myocardial infarction and low cardiac output.\r"

A retrospective analysis was performed of all veterans referred for clinical indications to a Veterans Administration Medical Center for a treadmill test after having undergone CABG. Of 2,044 patients who were exercise tested from April 1984 to May 1987, 296 had previously undergone CABG. Clinical data considered included age, sex, medication and symptom status, history of myocardial infarction, type of myocardial infarction and time from CABG. The exercise test responses considered were MET level, maximal heart rate, maximal systolic blood pressure, chest pain pattern and ST-segment response. During a 2-year follow-up after exercise testing, there were 15 deaths, 11 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 6 repeat CABGs and 3 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties. Although MET level and maximal heart rate were significantly related to prognosis and no patient who exceeded 8 METs died, the predictive power of these exercise test responses was low and ST-segment depression was not predictive at all. The inability of the exercise electrocardiogram to predict cardiac events in patients after CABG requires the use of other methods of testing to identify those who need invasive studies and intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Whether patients with silent myocardial ischemia have a lesser mass of ischemic myocardium than patients with symptomatic ischemia is controversial. Forty-five patients with angiographic coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 70% luminal diameter narrowing) were studied. All patients had ischemic patterns of myocardial uptake and clearance of the long-chain fatty acid perfusion/metabolic imaging agent iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid after maximal exercise. Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed and 25 myocardial segments were analyzed using circumferential activity profile curves. The 21 patients with silent treadmill ischemia exercised longer than the 24 patients with painful treadmill ischemia (430 +/- 137 vs 337 +/- 96 seconds, p less than 0.01) and to a higher heart rate (138 +/- 21 vs 125 +/- 18 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Patients with treadmill silent ischemia had the same number of abnormally perfused myocardial segments as patients with painful treadmill ischemia (8.6 +/- 4.5 vs 6.5 +/- 4.1 segments, difference not significant) and the same number of reversibly ischemic myocardial segments (4.0 +/- 1.4 vs 4.2 +/- 3.0 segments, difference not significant). The angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the 2 groups. Thus, in this selected group of patients, those with silent treadmill ischemia appear to have at least as great an extent of ischemic myocardium as patients with painful exertional ischemia.\r"

The diagnosis of aortic stenosis in most the prior studies has been based on clinical examination. We therefore utilized two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography to document the presence or absence of aortic stenosis in 29 men with gastrointestinal AVMs documented by endoscopy. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients studied, 22 (76 percent) had ejection systolic murmurs and 18 (62 percent) had echocardiographic evidence of aortic sclerosis. However, none of the patients had any evidence of aortic stenosis as assessed by Doppler echocardiography. CONCLUSION: Although previous case reports and retrospective studies have suggested an association between gastrointestinal AVMs and aortic stenosis, our study does not support this association and suggests the need for a prospective trial.\r"

  ".W": "INTRODUCTION: The etiology of ethanol-associated osteopenia is not fully understood. In order to define the role of ethanol in the pathogenesis of hepatic osteodystrophy, we compared two groups of alcoholic patients with histologically established alcoholic liver disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients currently drinking ethanol (\"drinkers\") and 12 claiming not to have consumed any ethanol for at least six months (\"abstainers\") were enrolled in the study. In addition, 35 non-alcoholic control subjects without clinical or biochemical evidence of liver disease were also studied. Bone mineral density and various biochemical and hormonal values were measured in each subject; iliac crest biopsies were taken under local anesthesia in the patients and under general anesthesia in the control subjects. RESULTS: Forearm bone mineral densities, spinal bone mineral densities, and iliac crest cancellous bone areas were significantly lower in the alcoholic patients compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01 for all measurements), but these values did not differ between the drinkers and the abstainers. The drinkers, however, had significantly less osteoblastic activity than the abstainers, as assessed by dynamic bone histomorphometry (p less than 0.001). Serum bone Gla-protein concentrations were higher in the abstainers than in the drinkers (p less than 0.001). No differences were seen relating to histologic parameters of bone resorption, although the alcoholic patients who had lower serum free testosterone concentrations than the control subjects also had higher urinary hydroxyproline excretion rates. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that ethanol may be responsible for osteoblastic dysfunction resulting in diminished bone formation and reduced bone mineralization.\r"

The radioactive microsphere technique provided these determinations before and after the intravenous administration of vehicle or 22, 65, 220, and 2200 pmol of CGRP. Neither vehicle nor 22 pmol of CGRP significantly changed any systemic or regional hemodynamic parameter. Starting at the 65-pmol dose, CGRP significantly decreased mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, while increasing heart rate without changing cardiac output. CGRP produced selective regional vasodilatory effects, with the coronary circulation being unusually sensitive. In contrast, CGRP caused significant increases in blood flow to the mesenteric and cutaneous circulations only at the two highest doses. CGRP increased plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and renin activity significantly at only the 2200-pmol dose. In conclusion, CGRP decreases blood pressure by peripheral vasodilation, with a threshold dose occurring between 22 and 65 pmol. In addition, the coronary circulation appears to be particularly sensitive to the vasodilatory properties of CGRP.\r"

After baseline data were collected, a placebo (N = 9) or mivacurium was administered over 60 seconds, the latter in doses of 0.15 (N = 18), 0.20 (N = 18), or 0.25 (N = 9) mg/kg. Measurements were repeated 2, 5, and 10 minutes later. Baseline measurements were similar. A slight decrease in heart rate over time reached statistical significance in several groups including the control group. Mean arterial, mean pulmonary arterial, pulmonary arterial occlusion, and right atrial pressures and cardiac output did not change, nor did systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances and cardiac index. Besides the decrease in heart rate, the only hemodynamic change to reach statistical significance was an increase in stroke volume in patients given mivacurium 0.25 mg/kg. Significant hypotension occurred in two patients; in one, a sudden decrease in mean arterial pressure of 24% occurred 1 minute after mivacurium 0.20 mg/kg. Blood pressure was restored by ephedrine 10 mg. In the other patient, given mivacurium 0.25 mg/kg, mean arterial pressure decreased 50% from 73 to 37 mm Hg. Recovery was rapid without treatment. It is concluded that mivacurium administered in doses of 0.15 to 0.25 mg/kg over 60 seconds to cardiac patients is associated with few significant hemodynamic effects. However, a small number of patients may experience significant transient hypotension when given doses greater than of 0.15 mg/kg, two times the ED95.\r"

The plasma is screened for hepatitis B antigen and HIV-1 virus to reduce the risk of transmission of hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This material is routinely stocked in some operating rooms. It is thus readily available when requested by a surgeon for use in combination with topical bovine thrombin to produce fibrin glue. From April 1985 to March 1987 this material was used by surgeons from eight different surgical specialties on 413 patients with a 91 per cent success rate (376/413). Uses have included sealing vascular suture lines, reinforcing pulmonary and esophageal staple lines, closing dural cerebrospinal fluid leaks, fixing split-thickness skin grafts, reducing lymphatic leakage, and controlling bone bleeding. Additional uses include closure of bronchopleural fistulas by means of the flexible bronchoscope, reduction of perioperative hemorrhage by spraying fibrin glue on the anterior mediastinum during cardiac surgery, and reduction of bleeding during debridement of burn eschars. Careful monitoring and patient follow-up detected no cases of transmission of blood-borne diseases. Only one complication, a local wound infection, has been documented. This material has been an important adjunct for the surgical services and may be safely used at hospitals with local blood bank facilities.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess whether interleukin-2 has a role in the pathogenesis of scleroderma. DESIGN: Observe serum effect on the in-vitro growth of an interleukin-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line and determine serum level by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SETTING: Outpatient rheumatology clinic of a university medical center. PATIENTS: Sera were collected from 47 patients with scleroderma, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 14 matched control subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A significant mitogenic effect was observed in sera from patients with scleroderma of recent onset; a lower proliferative response was seen in rheumatoid sera. Matched control sera had no mitogenic activity. Sera from patients with scleroderma of recent onset supported the in-vitro growth of an interleukin-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line. Matched control sera had no similar mitogenic activity. Interleukin-2 was found in sera from 41 of 47 patients with scleroderma (204 +/- 356 U/mL, mean +/- SD), in 9 of 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (2.04 +/- 5.16), and in none of 14 matched control subjects. There was a positive correlation between serum level and the skin progression index (skin score/disease duration). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of interleukin-2 in scleroderma sera strongly supports a role for T-cell activation in scleroderma. The association between serum levels and disease progression indicates that this T-cell process may participate in the progression of the disease.\r"

A consistent metabolic map of frontal hypometabolism was found in 7 patients. Brain metabolism was normal in 1 subject and diffusely decreased in another. In the 7 patients with selective hypofrontality, motor and premotor areas were severely hypometabolic, while heteromodal association cortex and paralimbic regions were comparatively less affected. Although this pattern of frontal alterations, probably due to disconnection, appeared consistent with the clinical features of the disease, it proved difficult to correlate the metabolic maps with neuropsychological disturbances.\r"

Blood in the subarachnoid space is accompanied by severe headache. We now report that this painful stimulus, which should enhance activity in V, specifically alters tachykinin peptide and mRNA levels in V and perivascular axons. Marked reductions in SP levels were observed in basilar artery segments within 4 hours after intracisternal blood injection which persisted for 48 hours and recovered by 7 days. SP peptide levels in V were elevated by 49% two days after blood injection. The changes in SP peptide levels were accompanied by increases in ganglionic content of the preprotachykinin mRNA that codes for the peptide. Blood-induced peptide depletion in arteries and subsequent increases in peptide and mRNA in V are consistent with increased neuronal activity and enhanced neuropeptide release. These results implicate the tachykinin-utilizing trigeminovascular neurons in the sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Depressed patients were matched for depression on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and subjects with OCD without depression and OCD with depression had similar levels of OCD without depression and OCD with depression had similar levels of OCD pathology. We also studied six non-sex-matched patients with mania. Mean (+/- SD) glucose metabolic rates for the left dorsal anterolateral prefrontal cortex, divided by the rate for the ipsilateral hemisphere as a whole (ALPFC/hem), were similar in the primary depressions (unipolar depression = 1.05 +/- 0.05; bipolar depression = 1.04 +/- 0.05), and were significantly lower than those in normal controls (1.12 +/- 0.06) or OCD without depression (1.15 +/- 0.05). Results for the right hemisphere were similar. Values in subjects with OCD with depression (1.10 +/- 0.05) were also significantly lower than in subjects with OCD without depression, and values in subjects with bipolar depression were lower than those in manic subjects (1.12 +/- 0.03) on this measure in the left hemisphere, although results were not significant in the right hemisphere. There was a significant correlation between the HAM-D score and the left ALPFC/hem. With medication for depression (n = 12), the left ALPFC/hem increased significantly and the percentage change in the Hamilton scale score correlated with the percentage change in the left ALPFC/hem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The coagulation profile was grossly abnormal in all patients, and the mean +/- SD intraoperative blood loss was 5.1 +/- 4.2 L; patients received 14 +/- 10 U of blood perioperatively. The amount of FG required to achieve hemostasis varied directly with the extent of injury and intraoperative blood loss (r = .84), and all patients with a blood loss greater than 4 L required at least 25 mL of FG to stop bleeding. Two patients died postoperatively secondary to cardiac arrest and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Intravenous infusion of hCGRP, alone, caused a transient but significant increase in heart rate (HR), hypotension, and facial flushing. Along with these effects, a positive inotropic action of hCGRP was documented by a noninvasive poligraphy. Furthermore, a significant increase in the catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine), in the cyclic nucleotide (cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP) plasma levels, and a small decrease in total calcium with no change in inorganic phosphorus serum levels, occurred. Also acute renal hCGRP induced effects were observed, as a significant increase in urinary volume and in the urinary calcium, sodium, potassium, and chloride excretion. Indomethacin did not affect all the cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal hCGRP-induced effects. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that hCGRP acts on the heart, vessels, and kidney, directly or indirectly, by the mediation of other vasodilating agents or systems excluding the prostaglandin system.\r"

The drug was injected cautiously, in lower doses than in patients with thalassaemia, and intramuscularly to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effects. Two of the three patients developed ocular abnormalities. One patient, who also received methyldopa, developed severe but reversible visual failure associated with an abnormal electro-oculogram (EOG); another showed reversible depression of the EOG. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of this patient showed an increase in phenanthroline detectable (non-caeruloplasmin-bound) copper. Analysis of the CSF of the third patient, who did not develop any clinical or electrophysiological ocular abnormalities, was normal. Haematological assessments indicated that all three patients probably had reduced iron stores. With in-vitro systems DFX was shown to mobilise copper from albumin and to facilitate copper movement across a cell membrane model, a property that was enhanced by methyldopa. Our observations are consistent with the concept that in rheumatoid patients low iron stores may result in binding of copper by DFX and that this may be of central importance in causing the ocular toxicity of DFX.\r"

  ".W": "During detailed immunophenotypic analyses of marrow blasts from 336 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, a very small percentage of cases reactive with B-cell-directed as well as T-cell-directed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were identified. Five ALL cases were biphenotypic since they coexpressed CD2 (Tp50) and CD19 (Bp95) antigens at the single-cell level. The composite immunophenotype of these biphenotypic ALL cases was [TdT+HLA-ABC+CD2+CD3-CD10+CD13-CD14-CD16-CD19+CD20+ ++-CD21-CD33-CD34+Bgp95-C mu- slg-]. Low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF), recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), and rIL-3 stimulated the proliferative activity of biphenotypic leukemic lymphocyte precursors without inducing differentiation. In the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, leukemic blasts from two cases differentiated along the B precursor pathway to the [CD2-CD10+CD19+CD20+C mu+slg-] pre-B cell stage. Biphenotypic ALL cases did not share a common configuration and gene rearrangement pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. Three cases had rearranged C mu genes but germline TCR genes, one case showed rearrangement of both C mu and TCR genes, and the remaining case had rearranged TCR genes but germline C mu genes. All five patients attained prompt remission after standard induction chemotherapy. Three to four years after initial diagnosis, four patients are now off chemotherapy and remain alive in their first remission. One patient relapsed at 3 years, 7 months, but promptly achieved complete remission after reinduction chemotherapy and remains in second remission off chemotherapy greater than 3 years after her reinduction therapy. With two-color immunofluorescence staining techniques and multiparameter flow cytometric analyses, we identified a small population of CD2+CD19+ lymphoid cells in fetal livers (FLs) and fetal bone marrows (FBMs), which may represent the putative normal counterparts of biphenotypic ALL blasts. A CD2+CD19+ normal biphenotypic lymphoid precursor cell line, designated FL 8.2 CD2+, was established from an FL of 8-weeks of gestational age by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced blastoid transformation. The composite immunophenotype of FL 8.2 CD2+ cell line was [TdT+HLA-ABC+HLA-DR+ CD2+CD5-CD7-CD10+/-CD13-CD19+CD20-CD21+ CD22+CD33-CD34+/-Bgp95-CDw40+C mu-slgD-slgM-]. FL 8.2 CD2+ cells showed germline patterns of immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region, heavy-chain constant region, kappa light-chain constant region genes, and TCR beta-chain genes. Cross-linking of CD2 as well as CD19 antigens on FL 8.2 CD2+ cells caused an increase of intracellular ionized calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This complication is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in this disorder. There is recent evidence that natural killer (NK) cells modulate B-cell immunoglobin (Ig) synthesis/secretion. The authors therefore evaluated the circulating NK cells from B-CLL patients on their ability to regulate mitogen-induced B-cell Ig synthesis. Blood, NK cells (CD16+, CD3-) from three B-CLL patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were able to clearly down-regulate the pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced-B-cell Ig secretion. In contrast, CD16+, CD3- cells from age-sex-matched controls or B-CLL patients with normal Ig were either nonregulatory or enhanced mitogen-induced B-cell Ig secretion. An alternative explanation for hypogammaglobulinemia in B-CLL patients is the immunomodulation of B-cell Ig production/secretion by CD16+, CD3- blood cells.\r"

The cells resemble immature plasma cells in that they exhibit a membrane phenotype that is intermediate between late B lymphocytes and plasma cells, even though they secrete IgG-lambda chains. Treatment of LP-1 cells with 12-0 tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or pokeweek mitogen (PWM) induces the appearance of surface markers and ultrastructural features typical of mature plasma cells but does not affect their proliferative activity. Molecular analysis of the cell line showed an increased expression of the c-myc protooncogene and the presence of abnormally sized transcripts. Conventional cytogenetics and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no structural rearrangements of the c-myc gene, suggesting that the abnormal c-myc expression may be due to point mutations or small deletions within the gene. The LP-1 cell line is a useful model in which to study the process of B-cell maturation; such study may lead to the uncovering of unusual mechanisms of c-myc activation. Furthermore, the LP-1 cell is a potential partner in the generation of human hybridomas.\r"

CF1 mice were injected with 0.5 microgram rhIL-1 alpha or heat-inactivated rhIL-1 alpha according to five different regimens, before and/or following 200 mg/kg CPM. Significant neutrophilia initially developed in treatment mice of all five regimens and accelerated granulocyte recovery occurred in treatment mice of four IL-1 regimens. Significant elevations in serum colony stimulating activity (CSA) occurred in treatment mice at a number of time points studied. In addition, marked increases in the percentage of maturing granulocyte precursors and in the proportion of cells cycling in S and G2/M were observed in treatment marrow throughout the IL-1 regimen. Before granulocyte recovery, premature nuclear segmentation was noted in metamyelocytes of treatment marrow. Concomitant with granulocyte recovery, treatment marrow was significantly more cellular and contained more total CFU-GM, more CFU-GM in S phase, more cells in S and G2/M, and more mitotic figures than control marrow. Splenic myelopoiesis was also enhanced in treatment mice. These data suggest that IL-1 significantly hastens granulocyte recovery following treatment with CPM by enhancing both proliferation and maturation of myeloid precursors.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously observed that von Willebrand factor (vWF) plays an important role in platelet deposition on subendothelium at low values of wall shear rate (200 to 400 seconds-1). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism responsible for such a defect in platelet deposition at low shear rates in the absence of vWF. Blood from both normal and von Willebrand's disease (vWD) animals was exposed to de-endothelialized aorta from normal pigs for a range of shear rates (200 to 3,000 seconds-1) and exposure times (three to 30 minutes) in a tubular perfusion chamber. Variations in the method of inhibiting coagulation (none, heparin, citrate, hirudin, and EDTA) and of perfusing blood (in vitro v ex vivo) were compared by determining the influence of wall shear rate and vWF on the deposition of 111In-labeled platelets on subendothelium. Whereas platelet deposition was reduced in the absence of vWF for all experimental variations at high shear rates (greater than 850 seconds-1), a defect was observed at low shear rates only when heparinized blood was exposed by means of an ex vivo perfusion system. Maximum sensitivity of the measurement occurs under ex vivo perfusion conditions due to the reduced ability of platelets to deposit in normal blood when recirculated in vitro. Our results indicate that vWF mediates platelet-vessel wall interaction even at low shear rates and that such effect can only be observed in systems where platelet function is minimally affected by the experimental conditions.\r"

The authors also examined in a small group of patients, five parameters of cell-mediated immunity and related them to HLA as well as to lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor/normal tissue interface. HLA-DR1 was significantly associated with thyroid carcinoma; the strongest association was in patients with follicular histologic features and DR1 homozygotes were not at greater risk for thyroid cancer. The HLA-DR3 was nonsignificantly increased in patients with papillary or mixed histologic features. The HLA-DR1, 3 heterozygotes were highly associated with follicular carcinoma, carried no risk for papillary carcinoma, and an intermediate risk for tumors with mixed histologic features. Because of the small proportion of DR1, 3 heterozygotes in the follicular and mixed histologic group, its predictive value at the population level was low. Better predictive potential was shown for the phenotype DR1 and/or DR3. Neither metastatic disease nor age at diagnosis (less than 45 years) could be related to HLA phenotypes. Patients in all histologic variants showed some measure of cell-mediated immunity compared to controls. Patients with papillary carcinoma showed an overall better response than those with tumors with follicular or mixed histology. The HLA-DR could not be related to cell-mediated immune response. Patients with papillary carcinoma with a good cell-mediated immune response occurred with much lower infiltration of the tumor boundary with lymphocyte whereas the follicular carcinoma less cell-mediated immunity was associated with dense lymphocytic infiltration, suggesting the biological relevance of lymphocytic infiltration may be different for the two histologic variants.\r"

A monoclonal cryoglobulin was intermittently found in the serum in one case. In two patients, kidney deposits were made of organized microtubular structures. Intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin inclusions in the two patients' lymphocytes showed a very similar electron microscopic pattern. The immunologic phenotype of leukemic lymphocytes was analogous in the three cases (with expression of CD2) and suggestive of a late maturation step. A complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed after therapy with chlorambucil (and prednisone). These observations suggest a direct role of monoclonal immunoglobulins in kidney disease.\r"

Daily intravenous administration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to rats produces chronic serum sickness glomerulonephritis, an immune-complex-mediated renal disease that is eventually always fatal. We have performed a detailed study of the onset of proteinuria in chronic serum sickness in order to assess the long-term consequences of discontinuing daily BSA injections precisely at that very early and well-defined stage of disease. 2. Urine and plasma samples from rats receiving daily BSA injections were collected and analysed daily before the onset of proteinuria, at which time the rats were divided into three groups. Group 1 continued to receive daily BSA injections, in group 2 injections were stopped on the first, and in group 3 on the third, day of proteinuria. Proteinuria began suddenly and was not preceded either by microalbuminuria or abnormalities of plasma composition. The sudden expression of proteinuria was accompanied by an equally rapid development of hypoalbuminaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. Development of the characteristic glomerular histopathology of serum sickness coincided with, but did not precede, the onset of proteinuria. Despite the discontinuation of antigen injections at the onset of proteinuria, basement membrane thickening was evident 8 weeks later; proteinuria persisted and hypercholesterolaemia increased. 3. In this model of immune complex glomerulonephritis, changes in kidney function and immunopathology were abrupt and closely linked, precluding the use of those criteria to predict when proteinuria would begin. Furthermore, extremely brief periods of active immunological injury to the peripheral capillary wall were sufficient to produce persistent abnormalities of glomerular structure and function.\r"

The clinical course of each patient was evaluated with the Multiple Organ Failure (MOF) score according to Goris. Neopterin could differentiate between septic and nonseptic patients (p less than .001), and E-alpha 1 PI between septic nonsurvivors and nonseptic patients only (p less than .01). In septic patients, acute pulmonary insufficiency was indicated by elevated E-alpha 1 PI values (greater than or equal to 400 micrograms/L) 1 day before mechanical ventilation was performed with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 82%. Defining a patient with MOF whose score was greater than or equal to 5 as a high-risk septic patient, a comparison neopterin greater than or equal to 40 nmol/L and E-alpha 1 PI greater than or equal to 400 micrograms/L, measured 1 day before the evaluation of an MOF score of greater than or equal to 5 yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 99% when patients fulfilled both criteria. We conclude that neopterin and E-alpha 1 PI might be useful parameters for the diagnosis of septicemia and monitoring of the clinical course in septic patients. Moreover, they might indicate the possible central role of macrophage and PMN activation in the development of MOF.\r"

A comparison group of immunocompromised patients with P carinii pneumonia also were reviewed. For HIV+ samples, sensitivity of DQ was 93 and 100 percent for cytopathologists and 75 and 89 percent for pulmonologists. Specificity was 95 percent for each cytopathologist and 100 percent for pulmonologists. For non-HIV+ patients, sensitivity ranged from 22 to 55 percent. Thus, DQ may be useful as a rapid, reliable method to identify P carinii in BAL fluid from HIV+ patients.\r"

Because thyroid hormone levels change rapidly following CABS, we also serially measured these hormone levels. The measured plasma concentrations for each of the above variables were corrected for hemodilution during CABS by using serum albumin changes as a reference. It was concluded that important alterations in SNS activity and thyroid hormone homeostasis occur in humans during CABS and deep hypothermia, and that changes in core temperature may contribute to these findings. We speculate that these hormonal changes may influence the response to adrenergic receptor therapy in hypothermic patients and may contribute to arrhythmias during rewarming and the immediate postoperative period.\r"

One hundred forty-five consecutive patients, aged 40 years and older, who had complained of rectal bleeding to a general practitioner, were referred to a specialist for full colonic investigation. Among 15 symptoms and clinical features examined, few had any statistically significant association with the source of bleeding. There was an elevated probability of colorectal cancer (21 percent) in patients who had seen blood mixed with feces. Most bowel symptoms and clinical features are not helpful in deciding whether to proceed with full colorectal assessment in patients aged 40 and older who have rectal bleeding of recent onset.\r"

One hundred sixteen laparoscopically documented EPs, the majority (90%) of whom were symptomatic, were diagnosed from an Emergency Department population. Eighty of 116 (69%) were unruptured, 37 (46.3%) of whom were eligible for MTX-CF chemotherapy. One patient refused chemotherapy. Thirty-four of the 36 (94.4%) patients treated with MTX-CF had complete resolution of their ectopics, whereas 2 experienced rupture after chemotherapy, 1 of them 23 days after MTX initiation. While there were no major chemotherapy-related side effects, 3 of the 36 (8.3%) patients experienced minor side effects. The authors conclude that: (1) individualized dosing of outpatient MTX-CF chemotherapy for symptomatic EP can be safely managed, even in an indigent population; (2) rupture can occur up to 23 days after chemotherapy initiation; (3) fetal cardiac activity is an absolute contraindication to chemotherapy; (4) chemotherapy in patients with symptoms is of limited value because the disease is too far advanced; therefore, it is essential that the diagnosis of EP be established before symptom onset; and (5) chemotherapy offers no significant immediate advantages to outpatient laparoscopic surgery. However, increasingly reliable nonlaparoscopic diagnosis will soon give wider application to this approach.\r"

The authors analyzed the peripheral blood of 23 women with the diagnosis of premature menopause to detect the presence of monoclonal antibody-defined T-lymphocyte abnormalities and/or antiovarian antibodies. All subjects were less than 40 years of age with the duration of menopause ranging from less than 1 year to 11 years at the time of study. Thirty-five percent of the subjects had an elevated percentage of Ia+ (Dr-activated) T cells using monoclonal antibody L243. The percent T4 (helper) T8 (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells and T4/T8 ratio were normal in the study group. Four subjects (approximately 17%) had elevated percentages of the age-related 3G5+ T cell subset. Two of the subjects with increased 3G5+ T cells also exhibited increased Ia+ T cells. Antiovarian steroid cell antibodies and antiadrenal cortical antibodies were present in approximately 9% of subjects. Anti-islet cell antibodies were not present. Thyroid antimicrosomal antibodies were present in 17% of subjects. Study subjects exhibited immunologic abnormalities that the authors hypothesize may play a role in the development of premature menopause in a larger percentage of patients than was previously suspected.\r"

The major source of this peptide is thought to be the placenta. We determined if the placenta and also the amnion, chorion, and decidua produce CRH, whether this material has biological activity, and whether CRH output is modulated by glucocorticoids and progesterone. In an in vitro monolayer culture system CRH was produced by the fetal membranes and decidua. Media immunoreactive CRH concentrations averaged 625 +/- 45 (SE) pg/10(5) cells in amnion, 701 +/- 56 pg/10(5) cells in chorion, and 580 +/- 60 pg/10(5) cells in decidual tissue obtained at cesarean section. This output was similar to that by the placenta (906 +/- 121 pg/10(5) cells). These values increased in tissue obtained after spontaneous labor. A single peak of CRH immunoreactivity eluting at the same position as synthetic human CRH, and possessing biological activity, was found in all tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in CRH output by all tissue types when cells were maintained in the presence of increasing concentrations of cortisol and dexamethasone. In contrast, increasing concentrations of progesterone decreased CRH output by all tissue types. We conclude that immuno- and biologically active CRH is produced not only in the human placenta, but also in the fetal membranes. CRH output by the placenta/fetal membranes is moderated by steroids, and changes with labor. These findings raise the possibility of a regulatory system similar to that of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, but residing within the placenta and fetal membranes.\r"

PLP shares NH2-terminal amino acid sequence similarity with PTH but has a unique primary structure thereafter. Studies reported to date have indicated that both native and synthetic amino-terminal PLP polypeptides display actions in vivo and in vitro that are similar to those of PTH. We report here that purified native PLP and synthetic 36Tyr(1-36)amide human PLP induce epidermal growth factor-dependent transformation of NRK 49F cells in soft agar. Further, the synthetic peptide induces a significant increase in the biosynthesis of fibronectin by human dermal fibroblasts. (1-34)PTH does not display either of these biological activities. These data indicate that there are qualitative differences between PTH and the recently identified PLP. The latter hormone appears to possess transforming growth factor-like properties that may be relevant to its physiological actions.\r"

All cell lines expressed the CD4 membrane phenotype, and their antigen reactivity was blocked by antibodies against monomorphic HLA DR/DP determinants. Using a panel of fusion proteins of different, overlapping mouse AChR alpha-chain sequences, a major T cell epitope was localized between amino acid positions 85 and 142. This determinant was distinct from the humoral main immunogenic region, which has been identified on the sequence 61-76. The response pattern of uncloned T lines from three patients with different HLA haplotypes suggests, however, that in any one MG patient T lymphocytes may recognize more than one autoantigenic epitope on the AChR alpha-chain, and that the T lymphocyte response profiles vary among individual patients.\r"

Many recent studies suggest that the DR4 effect is really due to DQ3.2, an allele of the nearby DQB1 locus. We used T cell clones, MAb, and allele-specific oligonucleotides to test IDDM and control subjects for DR4 subtypes (Dw4, Dw10, Dw13, and Dw14) and for DR4-associated DQB1 alleles (DQ3.1 and DQ3.2). We find that (a) IDDM is approximately equally associated with alleles of the DRB1 locus (Dw4 and Dw10, combined relative risk, RR = 6.4) and the DQB1 locus (DQ3.2, RR = 5.9); and (b) there is significant interaction, in a statistical sense, between these DR and DQ alleles in IDDM. The only IDDM-associated DR4 haplotypes were those carrying the IDDM-associated alleles at both loci (RR = 12.1); haplotypes with Dw4 or 10 but not DQ3.2, or vice versa, had a RR less than 1. Alternative explanations include: (a) that susceptibility requires specific allelic products of both DR and DQ loci; (b) that the combination of certain DR and DQ alleles marks haplotypes with the true susceptibility allele at a third locus; or (c) that Dw4 and 10 mark haplotypes with an allele at another locus that interacts with DQ3.2. As discussed, this third locus is unlikely to be DQA1 (DQ alpha). The data thus are not easily reconciled with an exclusive effect of HLA-DQ. This information increases our ability to predict IDDM by genetic typing: in the population studied, heterozygotes DR3/[DQ3.2, Dw4] or DR3/[DQ3.2, Dw10] had a relative risk of 38.0 and an absolute risk of 1 in 15.\r"

The overall density of lymphocytes in the perivascular and diffuse parts of the infiltrate was similar to that reported in other groups of subjects without evidence of immunosuppression. The CD4:CD8 ratio of the infiltrating lymphocytes throughout the section showed an inverse relation with clotting factor consumption. There was no significant change in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the diffuse infiltrate at various levels into the dermis in tuberculin reactions in patients with haemophilia, unlike healthy controls and other groups with no evidence of immunosuppression, who have previously been shown to have increasing CD4:CD8 ratio with increasing depth into the dermis. The number of cells bearing receptors for I12 and transferrin and of monocyte/macrophages was related to total lymphocyte density in the infiltrate. There was no evidence of serious impairment of the cell mediated response to a long term recall antigen, but the relatively low preponderance of CD4 lymphocytes in the diffuse infiltrate, particularly in the deeper dermis, may be the earliest indicator of impending immunosuppression.\r"

Using both flow cytometry and spectrofluorimetry, we find no differences in increase in mean calcium concentration and only a small decrease in number of cells with increased free calcium very early (1 minute after PHA) in the response of the older subjects' cells. It appears that the major age-associated defect(s) in signal transduction in human T cells may involve either early biochemical steps parallel to calcium mobilization or steps subsequent to transmembrane signaling.\r"

We found no other cases (in our institution or in literature review) where sclerotherapy or vasopressin infusion alone precipitated mesenteric thrombosis. During vasopressin infusion, there is portal stasis and an increased caudad flow of sclerosant. We suggest that mesenteric thrombosis is a consequence of the combination of these two effects. Direct injection of gastric varices is difficult because of increased postsclerotherapy bleeding, but sclerosis of esophageal varices often leads to their obliteration by the caudad flow of sclerosant. We propose, therefore, that vasopressin infusion during esophageal sclerotherapy may be beneficial in the obliteration of gastric varices. We conclude that (a) in patients without gastric varices, vasopressin infusion increases the incidence of mesenteric thrombosis, and (b) vasopressin infusion during sclerotherapy may enhance the sclerosis of gastric varices.\r"

This loss of adhesion is Ag-specific, but distinct from the lytic event because it can ensue in nominally Ca2+-free medium. In this study, we examine further the mechanism of CTL-induced loss of adhesion, concentrating mainly on the signal transduction pathway. Based on the differential sensitivity of CTL to extracellular Ca2+, protein kinase C activation/depletion and inhibition by anti-Lyt-2 (CD8) or anti-CTL receptor (TCR) reagents, we demonstrate that CTL-induced loss of adhesion can be initiated through multiple activation pathways. Although CTL-mediated lysis is restricted to a Ca2+ and protein kinase C-dependent signaling mechanism, CTL-induced loss of adhesion is initiated in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ or functional protein kinase C activity. Furthermore, although under physiologic conditions, anti-CD8 or anti-TCR reagents strongly block both CTL activities, under non-lytic conditions, they fail to inhibit the ability of CTL to promote loss of adhesion. These findings implicate the participation of additional CTL-TC ligand interactions resulting in loss of adhesion, and thus, provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that CTL-induced loss of adhesion can be initiated through multiple triggering pathways.\r"

Contrary to the CD2 activation requirements in TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ cells, cytotoxic activity in TCR gamma delta+/CD3+ clones and TCR-/CD3- NK cell clones can be induced by heteroconjugates containing a single anti-CD2 (OKT11.1) mAb. Activation of TCR gamma delta+/CD3+ cells via CD2 is independent of heteroconjugates binding to CD16 (Fc gamma RIII), because heteroconjugates prepared from Fab fragments induced equal levels of lysis. Moreover, anti-CD16 mAb did not inhibit triggering via CD2 in TCR gamma delta+/CD3+ cells. In TCR-/CD3- NK cells, however, induction of cytotoxicity via CD2 is co-dependent on interplay with CD16. Anti-CD3 mAb blocked the anti-CD2 x anti-DNP heteroconjugate-induced cytotoxicity of TCR gamma delta+/CD3+ cells, indicating a functional linkage between CD2 and CD3 on these cells. We conclude that induction of lysis via CD2 shows qualitatively different activation requirements in TCR gamma delta+/CD3+, TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ CTL and TCR-/CD3- NK cells.\r"

  ".U": "89156438\r", 
  ".W": "The elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions in mice is caused by the sequential action of two different T cells. An early-acting, DTH-initiating T cell produces an Ag-specific T cell factor, that is analogous to IgE antibody and initiates DTH by sensitizing the local tissues for release of the vasoactive amine serotonin. In picryl chloride or oxazolone contact sensitivity, this T cell factor is Ag-specific, but MHC unrestricted. We, therefore, hypothesized that DTH-initiating T cells are primitive T cells with Ag receptors that can bind Ag without MHC restriction. In order to characterize the origin of this DTH-initiating T cell and the conditions that are necessary for its development, we contact-sensitized various strains of immunodeficient mice. Surprisingly, we found that the early phase of DTH was present in athymic nude mice. In contrast, the early component of DTH was absent in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. These mice lack T and B cells, but have NK cells. These findings suggested that the early component of DTH was not caused by NK cells, and was caused by cells belonging to a lineage from a rearranging gene family. The early component of DTH in nude mice was Ag specific, was caused by MHC unrestricted Thy-1+ T cells, and was mediated by Ag-binding, Ag-specific T cell factors. We found that DTH-initiating, T cell-derived, Ag-binding molecules from nude mice and normal CBA/J mice had the same functional properties. The early component of DTH was elicited in two different systems (contact sensitivity and SRBC-specific DTH) in two strains of nude mice (BALB/c athymic nudes and CByB6F1/J-nu) from two different suppliers, but not in BALB/c and athymic nudes from a third supplier. From these findings we concluded that DTH-initiating T cells, which produce IgE-like Ag-specific T cell factors, are present in some strains of athymic nude mice and thus are relatively thymic independent T cells.\r"

Recent reports indicate that a small subpopulation of CD3+ T cells does not express alpha, beta TCR and lacks CD4 and CD8 molecules, but expresses another TCR heterodimer designated gamma, delta. To date, however, there are very few examples of gamma, delta TCR-bearing T cells which have Ag-specific functions and the precise role of the gamma, delta TCR remains unknown. In an attempt to explore the function of the gamma, delta TCR in man, we generated a panel of CD3+, CD4-, CD8- T cell clones from cultures of normal T cells stimulated with allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). All of the clones stained with mAb to gamma, delta TCR determinants, and Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA revealed mature gamma- and delta-chain transcripts and immature beta-chain transcript. The clones displayed cytolytic activity against their specific stimulating LCL, but not irrelevant LCL, and killing was inhibited by a mAb to HLA class I (HLA-A,B,C) determinants, suggesting that these cells recognized class I MHC antigenic determinants on specific stimulator/target cells. Cytolysis by these clones was markedly inhibited by low concentrations (0.00001 to 0.001 microgram/ml) of mAb to CD3 or TCR delta-chain, but high concentrations (0.1 to 20 micrograms/ml) of the same antibodies enhanced cytotoxicity. When absorbed to plastic tissue culture wells, anti-CD3 mAb stimulated the clones to proliferate. These results indicate that alloantigen specific, gamma, delta TCR+, CD4-, CD8- T cell clones can be reproducibly generated in vitro, and that the gamma, delta TCR plays a direct role in the specific recognition and cytolysis displayed by these clones.\r"

  ".U": "89156445\r", 
  ".W": "The Leu 23 Ag is a phosphorylated 28 to 32-kDa disulfide-linked homodimer expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Resting, unstimulated peripheral blood T cells are Leu 23-, but 20 to 30% of normal thymocytes constitutively express Leu 23. Triggering of the CD3/TCR complex by mAb induced the expression of Leu 23 within 2 h after stimulation. Leu 23 was still detectable on the cell surface 48 h after the stimulus was removed. The induction of Leu 23 strictly correlated with the extent of CD3/TCR cross-linking on the surface of T cells. Anti-CD3-coupled beads, but not soluble IgG or IgM mAb, were able to induce Leu 23 expression on peripheral blood T cells. Soluble anti-CD3 mAb were sufficient to induce Leu 23 on the Jurkat T cell line, but a direct relationship was found between CD3 cross-linking valency and Leu 23 expression. RNA and protein synthesis were both required for Leu 23 induction. Moreover, only CD3/TCR-mediated signals able to stimulate PKC and maintain elevated intracellular calcium ion concentration for greater than 60 min resulted in Leu 23 induction. These findings suggest that the extent of CD3/TCR cross-linking influences the persistence of elevated intracellular calcium ion concentration and PKC activation, and that this in turn determines the commitment of the T cell to activate gene transcription programs necessary for Leu 23 expression. Induction of Leu 23 represented the first detectable cell surface marker after triggering via the CD3/TCR and thus provides an ideal indicator to monitor the very early events in T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of methotrexate in murine acute graft vs host (GvH) disease at concentrations analogous to those used in human rheumatoid arthritis. The GvH reaction was induced by i.v. injection of parental spleen cells into a normal F1 recipient. The acute suppression of T cell function in GvH mice was prevented by methotrexate given orally for 10 days at 1.0 or 0.5 mg/kg but not at 0.25 mg/kg. T cell mitogen response and IL-2 secretion that were inhibited in GvH mice were restored by methotrexate. Protection from immunosuppression in drug-treated GvH mice lasted at least 3 wk after drug dosing was stopped. The mechanism of the protective effect appears to be a preferential inhibition of donor and host Lyt-2+ Ts cell proliferation. In mixing experiments we found that methotrexate inhibited Ts function in GvH mice. By dual fluorescence labeling we showed that the engraftment of donor Lyt-2+ cells was prevented by drug treatment. This was not true of donor L3T4+ cells which were clearly present in the spleens of GvH mice after methotrexate treatment. These donor L3T4 cells were functional in that they induced the production of anti-DNA autoantibodies in the methotrexate-treated GvH mice.\r"

Of the 35 cell lines of diverse origin examined for immunofluorescence staining by anti-2.28, only EBV-transformed cell lines showed strong staining by this mAb. One pre-B cell line, Nalm-12, could be induced by PMA to exhibit intermediate staining. Immunoprecipitation studies identified the 2.28 Ag as a 70- to 85-kDa monomer. Immunofluorescence staining, immunoprecipitation, and peptide mapping studies indicated that 2.28 was different from a number of monocyte and lymphocyte surface Ag including Mo3e, B-4 (CD19), B-5, CD39, and the G28-8 Ag Bgp 95. These studies suggest that 2.28 may be a novel hemopoietic non-lineage-specific activation Ag.\r"

We reported previously the isolation and functional expression of a mouse IL-6 (mIL-6) cDNA clone derived from bone marrow stromal cells. In this paper, we show that mIL-6 is a potent inducer of terminal macrophage differentiation for a mouse myeloid leukemic cell line, M1. Addition of mIL-6 to cultures of M1 cells rapidly inhibits their proliferation and induces phagocytic activity and morphologic changes characteristic of mature macrophages. These phenotypic changes are accompanied at the molecular level by a decrease in proto-oncogene c-myc mRNA accumulation and increases in Fc gamma R, proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-fms (CSF-1R) mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-6 enhances the expression of Fc gamma R and c-fms in differentiation-responsive D+, but not unresponsive D- sublines of mouse myelomonocytic leukemic WEHI-3B cells. Together with our previous observation that IL-6 stimulates colony formation by normal myeloid progenitors, these results strongly suggest an important regulatory role for IL-6 in myeloid cell growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of IL-2 in the isolated guinea pig lung perfused with phosphate-buffered Ringer's solution (containing 0.5 g/100 ml albumin and 5.5 mM dextrose) to determine the mechanism of IL-2-induced pulmonary edema. IL-2 (0 to 10,000 U/ml) was added to the perfusate following a 10 min baseline steady-state period. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc), and change in lung weight (as a measure of developing pulmonary edema) were recorded at 0, 10, 30, 40, and 60 min. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf.c), an index of vascular permeability to water, was measured at 30 and 60 min. Infusion of IL-2 increased Ppc (from 3.9 +/- 0.1 cm H2O at baseline to 8.8 +/- 1.1 cm H2O at 60 min for IL-2 at 2000 U/ml, p less than 0.01; and from 3.8 +/- 0.1 cm H2O at baseline to 8.9 +/- 0.6 cm H2O at 60 min for IL-2 at 10,000 U/ml, p less than 0.01. The lung weight also increased (32% at IL-2 concentration of 2000 U/ml, and 26% at IL-2 concentration of 10,000 U/ml) The capillary filtration coefficient did not change with IL-2 infusion. The IL-2 response was prevented using the pulmonary vasodilator, papaverine. The infusion of IL-2 was associated with the generation of thromboxane A2(TxA2) in the effluent perfusate. Inhibition of TxA2 synthetase using Dazoxiben prevented the pulmonary vasoconstriction and edema response to IL-2. In addition, IL-2 had no effect on the transendothelial clearance of 125I-albumin. The results indicate that IL-2 causes pulmonary edema secondary to an increase in Ppc. The response is mediated by IL-2 stimulation of TxA2 generation from the lung.\r"

  ".U": "89156455\r", 
  ".W": "IL-6, which is also known as IFN-beta 2, hybridoma growth factor, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and B cell differentiation factor, mediates acute phase responses including fever, has lymphocyte-stimulating capacities, and antiviral activity. IL-6 is produced by monocytes, fibroblasts, certain lymphocytes, and various tumor cells. The present study demonstrates that this multifunctional cytokine is released also by normal human epidermal cells (EC) and human epidermoid carcinoma cell lines (A431, KB). Accordingly, supernatants derived from freshly isolated EC, long term keratinocyte cultures, A431, or KB cells stimulated the proliferation of a hybridoma growth factor/IL-6-dependent plasmacytoma cell line (B9). IL-6 constitutively was produced in the presence of serum proteins. The addition of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or the tumor promoter PMA significantly enhanced the synthesis and release of EC-derived IL-6 (EC-IL 6). Like monocyte or fibroblast-derived IL-6, EC-IL-6 exhibited Mr microheterogeneity within 21 and 28 kDa. Similarly in Western blotting experiments an antiserum directed against human rIFN-beta 2/IL-6 detected the different Mr forms of EC-IL-6. Moreover, this antiserum was able to block the B9 cell growth-promoting capacity of EC-IL-6 strongly suggesting that this EC-derived mediator is closely related, if not identical with IL-6. This was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis detecting IL-6 specific mRNA both in long term cultured keratinocytes and A431 cells by hybridization with a cDNA fragment encoding for B cell differentiating factor 2/IL-6. Therefore, in addition to the production of other cytokines as previously reported, EC and in particular keratinocytes also synthesize and release IL-6. This further supports the important regulatory role of the epidermis during the pathogenesis of inflammatory, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases.\r"

In this study, we have investigated whether IL-1 can provide protection for human bone marrow colony-forming cells treated with high doses of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), a potent derivative of cyclophosphamide. We have established an in vitro model system which demonstrates that prior incubation with IL-1 protects early human hematopoietic progenitor cells from the lethal effects of high doses of 4-HC. These early progenitors give rise to blast cell colonies which appear late in the culture and are characterized by their ability to give rise to different types of secondary colonies when replated. Furthermore, prior incubation with IL-1 was shown not to protect HL-60 or K562 leukemic cells from the lethal effects of 4-HC. We conclude that IL-1 is able to protect early human hematopoietic progenitors from a non-cell cycle-specific chemotherapeutic agent such as 4-HC, whereas providing no protection for the leukemic cell lines HL-60 and K562.\r"

The effect of IL-3 was compared to that of IL-6. IL-3 stimulated IgG secretion from tonsil B cells or peripheral blood-derived B cells activated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain. This effect required the presence of IL-2. Neither B cell growth factor (BCGF) nor IFN-gamma replaced IL-2 in this function. IL-6 stimulated similar IgG secretion from tonsil B cells and also required the presence of IL-2. Moreover, the combination of IL-3 and IL-6 induced IgG secretion equivalent to that induced by either lymphokine. These data suggest that IL-3 and IL-6 might affect normal B cell differentiation by similar mechanism(s). The IL-3 effect on B cells appears to be caused by direct interaction with B cells because IL-3 induced a dose-dependent stimulation of IgG secretion from the JDA cells. This stimulation did not require the presence of IL-2. IL-6 displayed a similar effect on JDA cells and did not require IL-2. However, when IL-3 was combined with IL-6 a synergistic IgG secretion was observed in JDA cultures. These data suggest that IL-3 may potentiate the human immune response via stimulation of B cell differentiation and that its effect is dependent on the target B cell population, its stage of activation and/or maturation.\r"

These early interactions are likely to serve as modifiers of transcriptional activity and serve to prime monocytes for rapid synthesis of mediators. We have previously reported that adherence to plastic rapidly induced or down-regulated steady-state mRNA levels of a number of monocyte inflammatory mediator genes. We now report that adherence to surfaces pretreated with fibronectin resulted in TNF-alpha and CSF-1 mRNA levels approximating adherence to plastic, whereas adherence to fibronectin, fibronectin/anti-fibronectin complexes, or collagen resulted in markedly decreased levels of CSF-1 induction and lysozyme down-regulation. In contrast, monocyte adherence to collagen induced the highest sustained levels of TNF-alpha expression. PMA, but not the chemotactic factor FMLP, stimulated non-adherent monocytes to express c-fos and TNF-alpha and down-regulate lysozyme mRNA. Although all donors responded to adherence, several failed to produce CSF-1 mRNA after PMA stimulation in the non-adherent state. These data demonstrate that monocyte mediator expression may be more dependent on the selectivity of signals induced by adherence to different substrates than the initial chemotactic response.\r"

  ".W": "Interaction of Ag, antibodies against the T cell receptor complex, or mitogenic lectins with T lymphocytes induces hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids leading to the production of diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG then activates the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent phosphotransferase, protein kinase C (PKC). Increases in DAG concentrations are transient as is the increase in PKC activity. Phorbol esters, which induce potent, prolonged activation of PKC, augment many T lymphocyte responses, including cell proliferation and secretion of the T cell growth factor IL-2. Therefore, it has been suggested that activation of PKC is a positive regulatory signal in T lymphocytes. We have determined the consequences of transient stimulation of PKC, and of depletion of PKC, on early cell activation signals and on production of IL-2 by the murine lymphoma line LBRM 331A5. When this cell line is depleted of PKC overnight incubation in high concentrations of phorbol esters, lectin-induced IL-2 secretion is augmented. Similarly, mitogen-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and phosphoinositide metabolism were augmented in these cells. In contrast, a short preactivation of PKC abrogated these early transmembrane signaling events. This suggested that normal physiologic activation of PKC may limit cell activation and decrease IL-2 production. We compared the effects of phorbol esters and mezerein, which produce prolonged activation of PKC, with those of diacylglycerol analogs, which induce transient activation of PKC. At concentrations that give similar levels of PKC activation, phorbol esters and mezerein, but not DAG analogs, increased IL-2 secretion. This suggests that prolonged, nonphysiologic activation of PKC is required to augment IL-2 secretion. Therefore, physiologic activation of PKC may not augment T cell activation but instead may function to decrease cell activation and limit IL-2 secretion.\r"

The present study was aimed at investigating possible regulation of such potentially destructive responses elicited by IL-1 on endothelial cells. Culture supernatants of IL-1-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) were depleted of retroviral p15E-related Ag with immobilized anti-p15E mAb. The monocyte chemotactic and polarizing activity of supernatants of IL-1-treated HEC (presumably related to colony-stimulating factors being released by HEC) was markedly augmented by absorption on immobilized anti-p15E antibodies. Irrelevant IgG had no effect and anti-p15E antibodies did not affect the chemotactic activity of supernatants from unstimulated HEC. The material eluted from Sepharose-bound anti-p15E antibodies was devoid of chemotactic and polarizing activity and suppressed the polarization and migration of monocytes in response to chemoattractants. The alpha and beta molecular species of IL-1 were equally effective in inducing the production of p15E-related inhibitor. The production of a p15E-related inhibitor of chemotaxis induced by IL-1 in HEC may represent a negative signal in the regulation of the potentially destructive responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r"

The chimeric GK1.5 gamma 2a, GK1.5 gamma 2b, and GK1.5 gamma 3 antibodies are more efficient than rat GK1.5 at C-mediated cytotoxicity.

Administration of anti-Lyt-2 mAb resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphoid cells expressing the Lyt-2+ phenotype. Such treatment led to enhanced disease in both resistant C57BL/6 and irradiated BALB/c mice, as assessed by lesion size, but did not affect the capacity of these mice to ultimately resolve their infections. In contrast, anti-Lyt-2 treatment totally blocked the induction of resistance in i.v. immunized mice. These results suggest, that Lyt-2+ T cells may play a role in immunity to a Leishmania major infection and that their relative importance to resistance may depend on how resistance is induced.\r"

We demonstrate dissociate expression of E alpha d within the macrophage lineage as well as within the B cell lineage, and present evidence for a repressive element operative in B cells and macrophages. We describe the generation of novel transgenic lines with limited constitutive and inducible E alpha mRNA and I-E protein.\r"

  ".W": "HLA-A2.1 and HLA-A2.3, which differ from one another at residues 149, 152, and 156, can be distinguished by the mAb CR11-351 and many allogeneic and xenogeneic CTL. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to incorporate several different amino acid substitutions at each of these positions in HLA-A2.1 to evaluate their relative importance to serologic and CTL-defined epitopes. Recognition by mAb CR11-351 was completely lost when Thr but not Pro was substituted for Ala149. A model to explain this result based on the 3-dimensional structure of HLA-A2.1 is presented. In screening eight other mAb, only the substitutions of Pro for Val152 or Gly for Leu156 led to the loss of mAb binding. Because other non-conservative substitutions at these same positions had no effect, these results suggest that the loss of serologic epitopes is in many cases due to a more indirect effect on molecular conformation. Specificity analysis using 28 HLA-A2.1-specific alloreactive and xenoreactive CTL clones showed 19 distinct patterns of recognition. The epitopes recognized by alloreactive CTL clones demonstrated a pronounced effect by all substitutions at residue 152, including the very conservation substitution of Ala for Val. Overall, the most disruptive substitution at amino acid residue 152 was Pro, followed by Glu, Gln, and then Ala. In contrast, substitutions at 156 had little or no effect on allogeneic CTL recognition, and most clones tolerated either Gly, Ser, or Trp at this position. Similar results were seen using a panel of murine HLA-A2.1-specific CTL clones, except that substitutions at position 156 had a greater effect. The most disruptive substitution was Trp, followed by Ser and then Gly. In addition, when assessed on the entire panel of CTL, the effects of Glu and Gln substitutions at position 152 demonstrated that the introduction of a charge difference is no more disruptive than a comparable change in side chain structure that does not alter charge. Taken together, these results indicate that the effect of amino acid replacements at positions 152 and 156 on CTL-defined epitopes depends strongly on the nature of the substitution. Thus, considerable caution must be exercised in evaluating the significance of particular positions on the basis of single mutations. Nonetheless, the more extensive analysis conducted here indicates that there are differences among residues in the class I Ag \"binding pocket,\" with residue 152 playing a relatively more important role in formation of allogeneic CTL-defined epitopes than residue 156.\r"

DNA cloning and sequencing analysis were necessary to determine the used genes because of the presence of multiple rearrangements in these hybridomas. Among eight hybridomas analyzed, five used V gamma 4, two used V gamma 7, and one used V gamma 6 for gamma-genes, and four used V delta 5, two used V delta 4, and two used V delta 7 for delta-genes. The last delta-gene is documented for the first time. V gamma and V delta appear to pair randomly only restricted by the frequency of the utilization of individual V gamma and V delta segments. These gamma- and delta-genes contained N region addition between the V and J region in most cases. Both D delta 1 and D delta 2 regions were used in the most delta-genes as was seen previously. These results show that certain gamma- and delta-gene segments that are rarely used for the expression on fetal thymocytes are preferentially used by adult thymocytes. Also the repertoire of the gamma delta receptors on adult thymocytes is much greater than that on fetal thymocytes. BW5147 specific V4-C1 gamma-gene was expressed in all of the adult hybridomas. Inasmuch as this gene was not expressed in BW5147 cells or in fetal thymocyte hybridomas expressing V5 or V6 gamma genes, there exists a novel V gene segment-dependent control of transcription in the gamma-gene system.\r"

To understand the direct or indirect effects of IL-2 on eosinophils, the physical and functional characteristics of the late-treatment eosinophils were compared to those of early-treatment and control eosinophils. Late-treatment eosinophils differed from early-treatment and control eosinophils in the following respects: they had somewhat reduced density, hypersegmented nuclei, eosinophil cationic protein converted from the storage form to the secretory form, and a greater than 200% increased ability to kill larvae of Schistosoma mansoni by an antibody-dependent mechanism (cytotoxic function). In vitro, IL-2 (1000 U/ml in medium as used to culture LAK cells) did not affect the cytotoxic function of eosinophils from cancer patients or from control subjects. However, LAK cell-conditioned medium enhanced the cytotoxic function of eosinophils from early-treatment cancer patients and from normal subjects by greater than 150%. Thus, eosinophils late in the course of IL-2/LAK cell treatment undergo physical changes and become functionally activated. The involvement of IL-2 in these changes is probably indirect, as an inducer of factors that enhance eosinophil function.\r"

For an evaluation of the ability of lymphocytes from leukemic children to produce this cytokine, the production of IL-2 by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined in children with acute leukemia at the time of diagnosis, during clinical remission, and at the time of relapse. Of 16 patients, 11 (69%) with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia at the time of diagnosis had IL-2 production levels above the highest level observed in control subjects, and all but one had values above the control mean. Three of five treated patients had elevated IL-2 production at the time of bone marrow relapse. In addition, of 37 patients examined during clinical remission (both during chemotherapy and after the completion of maintenance chemotherapy), five had IL-2 production values above the control range and four of these five patients subsequently had relapses, compared with only one relapse in the remaining 32 patients with normal or below-normal levels of IL-2 production. These results demonstrate an increased ability to produce IL-2 by many patients with acute leukemia, both at the time of diagnosis and at relapse. Elevated IL-2 production may represent an immunologic response to leukemic cells and in some patients may provide a marker for persistent leukemia.\r"

  ".U": "89157239\r", 
  ".W": "In a retrospective analysis of 24 cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in neonates born in the province of Manitoba during the last 20 years, we set out to determine whether patients, in particular male infants with salt-losing CAH, were being missed by the usual forms of clinical ascertainment. Although the overall incidence of 1/14,500 live births was similar to that found in several screening surveys, a skewed female/male sex ratio of 2.2:1 suggested probable death among male infants with unrecognized adrenal insufficiency. These results led to a prospective analysis of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels in 1194 neonatal blood specimens by a solid-phase direct radioimmunoassay procedure to determine whether this method would be suitable for CAH screening. In 1103 neonates weighing greater than 2500 gm at birth, all 17-OHP values were less than 30 nmol/L (approximately 1000 ng/dl), with a mean of 8.2 nmol/L; values in male infants were slightly higher than in female infants. In 89 neonates with a birth weight less than 2500 gm, 17-OHP values were skewed, with nine having levels greater than 30 nmol/L and two greater than 50 nmol/L. Postnatal age (1 to 24 days) at the time of specimen collection had no effect on 17-OHP levels, although higher values occur during the first 24 hours. One unsuspected case of CAH in a male infant was discovered during the trial period. We conclude that neonatal CAH screening can permit diagnosis and therapy of affected male infants who are being missed by normal clinical evaluation. This radioimmunoassay method is relatively simple and inexpensive, and it has the specificity and sensitivity necessary to provide such mass screening.\r"

Preliminary carotid endarterectomy (CE) was feasible before CAB in only 24 patients with stable cardiac disease (group I). Another 129 patients with unstable disease (group II) had unilateral, asymptomatic carotid lesions and were prospectively randomized to receive either combined operations (IIA; n = 71) or CAB followed by delayed CE (IIB; n = 58). The remaining 122 patients (group III) had symptomatic or bilateral carotid stenosis and were managed on a selective basis without randomization. The operative mortality rate ranged from 4.2% to 5.2%, and the early stroke rates were 4.2% in group I, 7.8% in group II, and 11% in group III. Postoperative strokes occurred after CAB in nine (4.7%) of the 193 patients protected by preliminary or simultaneous CE, compared with six (7.4%) of the 81 who received only delayed CE. Nevertheless, the composite stroke risk for \"reverse-staged\" procedures in group IIB (14%) exceeded that for combined operations (2.8%) in group IIA (p = 0.045). The stroke rate was 11% (7/61) when delayed CE was performed within 2 weeks after CAB compared with 2.2% (1/46) with longer staging intervals.\r"

The patient's circulating lymphocytes were normal in number and phenotype, but stimulation of the T-cell receptor by antigens, mitogens, and monoclonal antibodies failed to induce interleukin-2-receptor expression, interleukin-2 synthesis, or lymphocyte proliferation. The early biochemical events necessary to initiate lymphocyte activation--accumulation of the second messenger diacylglycerol, activation of the enzyme protein kinase C, and elevation of the free intracellular calcium concentration--failed to occur in this patient's lymphocytes. The defect in the lymphocyte could be corrected in vitro by two agents that bypass the receptor-mediated signal mechanism (the diacylglycerol analogue phorbol and the calcium ionophore ionomycin). Further studies localized the defect in signal transduction to the interaction between cell-surface receptors and the guanine nucleotide-binding protein. We conclude that this patient's immunodeficiency was caused by a defective coupling of surface receptors to signal-transducing proteins in his T lymphocytes, resulting in failure of lymphocyte activation.\r"

On the basis of either interviews or urine assays conducted prenatally or post partum, 27 percent of the subjects had used marijuana during pregnancy and 18 percent had used cocaine. When only positive urine assays were considered, the corresponding values were 16 percent and 9 percent, respectively. When potentially confounding variables were controlled for in the analysis, the infants whose mothers had positive urine assays for marijuana, as compared with the infants whose mothers were negative according to both interviews and urine assays, had a 79-g decrease in birth weight (P = 0.04) and a 0.5-cm decrement in length (P = 0.02). Women who had positive assays for cocaine, as compared with nonusers, had infants with a 93-g decrease in birth weight (P = 0.07), a 0.7-cm decrement in length (P = 0.01), and a 0.43-cm-smaller head circumference (P = 0.01). To compare our findings with those of other investigators who did not use urine assays, we repeated the analyses, considering only self-reported use of marijuana (23 percent) and cocaine (13 percent). There were no significant associations between such use as determined by interviews alone and any of the measures of outcome. We conclude that the use of marijuana or cocaine during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal growth and that measuring a biologic marker of such use is important to demonstrate the association.\r"

The early class of HIV-1 transcripts is fully spliced and encodes viral regulatory gene products. The functional expression of one of these nuclear regulatory proteins, termed Rev (formerly Art or Trs), induces the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced, late class of HIV-1 mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins, including Gag and Env. Here, we provide evidence that this induction reflects the export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm of a pool of unspliced viral RNA constitutively expressed in the nucleus. The hypothesis that Rev acts on RNA transport, rather than splicing, is further supported by the observation that the cytoplasmic expression of a non-spliceable HIV-1 env gene sequence is also subject to Rev regulation. Here we show that this Rev response requires a specific target sequence which coincides with a complex RNA secondary structure present in the env gene. The response to Rev is fully maintained when this sequence is relocated to other exonic or intronic locations within env but is ablated by inversion. These results indicate that the HIV-1 rev gene product induces HIV-1 structural gene expression by activating the sequence-specific nuclear export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNA species.\r"

  ".W": "The CD4 T-cell surface antigen is an integral membrane glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 55,000 which binds class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). It is thought to stabilize physical interactions between T cells and APCs (for a review, see ref. 1). Evidence is accumulating that suggests that CD4 can transduce an independent signal during T-cell activation. It has recently been shown that CD4 expressed on human and murine T cells is physically associated with the Src-related tyrosine protein kinase p56lck (refs 7, 8). These results indicate that CD4 can function as a signal transducer and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation events may be important in CD4-mediated signalling. Here, we present evidence that cross-linking of the CD4 receptor induces a rapid increase in the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of p56lck and is associated with the rapid phosphorylation of one of the subunits (zeta) of the T-cell receptor complex on tyrosine residues. These data provide direct evidence for a specific CD4 signal transduction pathway that is mediated through p56lck and suggest that some of the tyrosine phosphorylation events detected during antigen-mediated T-cell activation may result from signalling through this surface molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) expressing the CD8 glycoprotein recognize peptide antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This correlation and the absence of CD8 polymorphism led to the hypothesis that CD8 binds to a conserved site of class I MHC molecules. Using a cell-cell binding assay we previously demonstrated specific interaction between human class I MHC (HLA-A,B,C) molecules and CD8. Subsequent analysis of the products of 17 HLA-A,B alleles revealed a natural polymorphism for CD8 binding in the human population. Two molecules, HLA-Aw68.1 and HLA-Aw68.2, which do not bind CD8, have a valine residue at position 245 whereas all other HLA-A,B,C molecules have alanine. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that this single substitution in the alpha 3 domain is responsible for the CD8 binding phenotype and also affects recognition by alloreactive and influenza-specific CTL. Our results indicate that CD8 binds to the alpha 3 domain of class I MHC molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular analysis of many genetic diseases requires the isolation of probes for defined human chromosome regions. Existing techniques such as the screening of chromosome-specific libraries, subtractive DNA cloning and chromosome jumping are either tedious or not generally applicable. Microdissection and microcloning has successfully been applied to various chromosome regions in Drosophila and mouse, but conventional microtechniques are too coarse and inefficient for analysis of the human genome. Because microdissection has previously been used on unbanded chromosomes only, cell lines in which the chromosome of interest could be identified without banding had to be used. At least one hundred chromosomes were needed for dissection and lambda vectors used to achieve maximum cloning efficiency. Recombinant phage clones are, however, more difficult to characterize than plasmid clones. Here we describe the dissection of the Langer-Giedion syndrome region on chromosome 8 from GTG-banded metaphase chromosomes (G-banding with trypsin-Giemsa) and the universal enzymatic amplification of the dissected DNA. Eighty per cent of clones from this library (total yield 20,000) identify single-copy DNA sequences. Fifty per cent of clones detect deletions in two patients with Langer-Giedion syndrome. Although the other clones have not yet been mapped, this result demonstrates that thousands of region-specific probes can be isolated within ten days.\r"

These children were revaccinated with polysaccharide vaccine at 24 to 27, 30 to 33, or 36 to 39 months of age. The post-reimmunization geometric mean antibody concentrations in these three groups were 3.1, 3.0 and 7.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, and the percentages rising to greater than 1 microgram/ml were 75, 80 and 93%. The geometric means and antibody response rates were nearly identical to age-matched control groups not previously vaccinated. Thus there was no evidence of priming (memory induction) or of tolerance induction by the early (18 months old) primary vaccination.\r"

Twelve mothers (28%) had a history of genital herpes during pregnancy, and two had had labial herpes infection. Eight infants (19%) were delivered by cesarean section. In 14 (33%) infants symptoms appeared within 24 hours and in 26 (61%) they appeared within 7 days. The presenting symptoms were neurologic in 79%, cutaneous in 30%, respiratory in 19%, cyanosis/pallor/grayish skin in 16%, irritability in 12% and fever in 7%. Herpes simplex virus was detected most early and frequently in pharyngeal swabs, in one-third on Postnatal Days 2 to 5. Cerebrospinal fluid contained an increased amount of protein and/or pleocytosis in 72%. Abnormal electroencephalographic background activity appeared in 56% and electrical paroxysms in 41%. Six infants (14%) died, 9 (21%) were damaged severely and 6 (14%) were moderately or mildly damaged. Poor prognosis was associated with acute maternal illness at delivery, prematurity, visceral involvement and/or electrical paroxysms in the electroencephalograms. This study underlines the occurrence of intrauterine transmission of herpes virus, infections with neurologic manifestations, early symptomatology and the need for prompt diagnosis, brain biopsy in selected patients and antiviral therapy in neonates with herpes virus infection.\r"

  ".W": "Human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression can be induced primarily in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage by a variety of inducers, including lipopolysaccharide, phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and virus or synthetic double-stranded RNA [poly(I).poly(C)]. In this paper we show that the TNF-alpha gene also responds to virus and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in B lymphocytes and that virus is the most potent inducer of TNF-alpha mRNA in both monocyte and B-cell lines. In addition, we show that viral infection coinduces the expression of TNF-alpha and interferon beta mRNA and that viral induction of both genes is blocked by the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide had no effect on mRNA expression of the genes in one of three cell lines tested (U937) but blocked the viral induction of both genes in another (Namalwa). Thus, the regulatory factors required for mRNA induction of both genes are present prior to the addition of virus in U937 but not in Namalwa cells. However, in a third cell line (JY), cycloheximide blocked viral induction of the interferon beta gene but not the TNF-alpha gene. Taken together, these observations suggest that viral induction of TNF-alpha and interferon beta gene expression may involve overlapping pathways with both common and distinct regulatory factors.\r"

Our results show that rev increases the stability of the unspliced viral mRNA, while it does not affect the stability of the multiply spliced viral mRNAs that do not contain the rev-responsive element. The study of mutated proviral constructs producing mRNA that cannot be spliced revealed that the effect of rev on stability is independent of splicing. Our experiments also indicate that rev promotes the transport of the viral mRNA containing the rev-responsive element from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The proposed functions of rev are consistent with its nuclear localization as shown by immunofluorescence. The selective effects of rev on the levels of the viral mRNA suggest a model for feedback regulation by rev leading to a steady state of viral expression.\r"

Previously we have found that in intact cells stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity by EGF is correlated with the retention of increased amounts of PLC activity by a phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity matrix, suggesting that the EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates PLC. We now define parameters of the mechanism by which EGF addition to A-431 cells stimulates phosphotyrosine immunoisolation of PLC activity and demonstrate that EGF addition to A-431 cells increases tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC. EGF rapidly and reversibly stimulated the anti-phosphotyrosine recovery of increased PLC activity when cells were treated with growth factor at 3 degrees C, indicating that receptor internalization is not required and that the phosphorylation event occurs prior to formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Also, the EGF stimulation of anti-phosphotyrosine recovery of PLC activity occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Stimulation of PLC activity in intact cells by other agonists, such as bradykinin or ATP, did not result in increased anti-phosphotyrosine recovery of PLC activity, suggesting two separate mechanisms exist in A-431 cells for hormone-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates. Finally, using monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize three distinct PLC isozymes, we show that an approximately 145-kDa PLC isozyme (PLC-II) is present in A-431 cells and that EGF treatment of A-431 cells stimulates phosphorylation of PLC-II on both tyrosine and serine residues.\r"

  ".W": "BB3 and delta-TCS1 monoclonal antibodies identify two distinct nonoverlapping populations of T-cell receptor (TcR) gamma/delta (TcR-1)-positive cells, which express a disulfide-linked and a nondisulfide-linked form of TcR, respectively. BB3+ cells represented the majority of circulating TcR-1+ cells, but they were virtually undetectable in the thymus. On the other hand, delta-TCS1+ cells were largely predominant among TcR-1+ thymocytes but represented a minority in peripheral blood (PB). Similar distributions were observed by clonal analysis of thymocytes or PB TcR-1+ populations. The use of joining region (J)-specific probes indicated that BB3+ and delta-TCS1+ clones displayed different patterns of J rearrangement. Thus, the disulfide-linked form of TcR-1 (BB3+ clones) was associated with the expression of J segments upstream to the C gamma 1 gene segment, whereas the nondisulfide-linked form (delta-TCS1+ clones) was associated with the expression of J segments upstream to C gamma 2. delta-TCS1+ clones, in most instances, exhibited a growth pattern different from that of BB3+ or conventional TcR alpha/beta+ clones as they adhered promptly to surfaces, spread, and emitted long filopodia ending with adhesion plaques. Ultrastructural analyses showed, exclusively in delta-TCS1+ cells, nuclear deformations, uropod formation, and abundant cytoskeletal structures. In addition, immunofluorescence studies of this subset of TcR-1+ cells revealed the presence of abundant microtubules, intermediate filaments, and submembranous microfilaments. Thus, our findings suggest that delta-TCS1+ cells are capable of active motility.\r"

Antibodies against IL-4 and IL-6 or against receptors for IL-2, IL-3, and IL-5 did not inhibit this effect of rIL-7 on the pro-B clones. rIL-7 alone or in various combinations with other cytokines (from rIL-1 alpha to rIL-6) could not induce differentiation of the pro-B clones into IgM+ B cells regardless of the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The RP.0.10 marrow stroma cells by themselves do not support the growth of the pro-B clones. However, the pro-B clones grew when cultured with rIL-7 and monolayers of the RP.0.10 stroma cells. While the RP.0.10 stroma cells induced the pro-B clones to differentiate into IgM+ B cells but not T3+ T cells when cultured in the presence of LPS and rIL-3, the B-cell progenitor clones gave rise to significantly higher numbers of IgM+ B cells (up to 63%) and to many more B cells expressing higher levels of surface IgM when cocultured with rIL-7, LPS, and RP.0.10 stroma cells. The pro-B clones also generated IgM+ B cells (up to 20%) when cocultured with RP.0.10 stroma cells and rIL-7 in the absence of LPS. By using culture plates designed for testing requirements for cell-cell contact, we found that cell interactions between the pro-B cell and the marrow stroma cell are essential to induce rearrangement and expression of the immunoglobulin genes in the pro-B clones. Possible mechanisms to account for the remarkable effects of rIL-7 in the presence of RP.0.10 stroma cells on both growth and differentiation of the pro-B clones are discussed. Finally, rIL-7 alone or together with RP.0.10 stroma cells neither supported proliferation nor induced differentiation into T3+ T cells or IgM+ B cells of the marrow pro-T clones or the fetal thymocyte clones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This report demonstrates that the choroid plexus, which constitutes the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, is able to present foreign antigen to, and stimulate the proliferation of, peripheral helper T lymphocytes through an Ia-dependent, major histocompatibility complex-restricted mechanism. Furthermore, in vivo, choroid plexus epithelial cells have access to, and are capable of taking up, virus-sized particles injected elsewhere into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus these data suggest that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier may play a role in immunological communication between the central nervous system and periphery, a function relevant to the initiation of immunological responses to central nervous system infections and autoimmune processes and for the surveillance of tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

The carboxyl-terminal half of amphiregulin (residues 46 to 84) exhibits striking homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of proteins. Amphiregulin binds to the EGF receptor but not as well as EGF does. Amphiregulin fully supplants the requirement for EGF or transforming growth factor-alpha in murine keratinocyte growth, but it is a much weaker growth stimulator in other cell systems.\r"

  ".W": "Focal adhesion of leukocytes to the blood vessel lining is a key step in inflammation and certain vascular disease processes. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of blood neutrophils. A full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for ELAM-1 has now been isolated by transient expression in COS cells. Cells transfected with the ELAM-1 clone express a surface structure recognized by two ELAM-1 specific monoclonal antibodies (H4/18 and H18/7) and support the adhesion of isolated human neutrophils and the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Expression of ELAM-1 transcripts in cultured human endothelial cells is induced by cytokines, reaching a maximum at 2 to 4 hours and decaying by 24 hours; cell surface expression of ELAM-1 protein parallels that of the mRNA. The primary sequence of ELAM-1 predicts an amino-terminal lectin-like domain, an EGF domain, and six tandem repetitive motifs (about 60 amino acids each) related to those found in complement regulatory proteins. A similar domain structure is also found in the MEL-14 lymphocyte cell surface homing receptor, and in granule-membrane protein 140, a membrane glycoprotein of platelet and endothelial secretory granules that can be rapidly mobilized (less than 5 minutes) to the cell surface by thrombin and other stimuli. Thus, ELAM-1 may be a member of a nascent gene family of cell surface molecules involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immunological events at the interface of vessel wall and blood.\r"

Sciatic pain was more common among machine operators and carpenters than among office workers, and also more frequent among machine operators than among carpenters. The occupational differences were considerably smaller with regard to lumbago and nonspecific LBP. In multivariate analysis, occupation, age, reported back accidents, and postural load showed significant independent effects on the occurrence of sciatic pain. Allowing for other risk indicators, the relative risk was 1.3 contrasting machine operators with both office workers and carpenters, but carpenters had no excess risk as compared with office workers.\r"

A special protocol--including analysis of reflux symptoms, radiology, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and standard acid reflux test--was designed. The surgical technique used was as follows: (1) highly selective vagotomy, (2) closure of the hiatus, (3) calibration of the cardia, (4) posterior gastropexy, and (5) fixation of the gastric fundus to the diaphragm. The operative mortality rate was 0.4%, and postoperative complications occurred in 5% of the patients. Only 5% of the patients were lost from the late follow-up. A total of 150 patients with more than 5 years since operation were completely evaluated. Reflux symptoms greatly decreased after surgery. Radiologic studies were normal in 93% of the patients, and endoscopy showed a long-standing healing of macroscopic esophagitis in 83% of the cases. Manometric features were analyzed in 159 patients before and in 115 patients 1 year after surgery. A significant increase in lower esophageal sphincter pressure was demonstrated, as well as an increase in the total length and abdominal length of this sphincter (p less than 0.0001). The increase in gastroesophageal sphincter was evaluated in 46 patients 1 year and 5 years after surgery, and this showed a maintenance of sphincter competence. Esophageal clearance markedly improved after surgery, and the standard acid reflux test, which was positive in 100% of cases before surgery, persisted positive in 16% (p less than 0.001). Final clinical evaluation 5 years after surgery demonstrated excellent and good results in 85% of the patients and failure or reoperation in 8% of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Regurgitant blood flow is associated with localized signal loss of the blood pool within the recipient chamber on cine MR images, which may be useful for assessing regurgitant valvular disease. To evaluate the potential of this technique for determining the severity of aortic regurgitation, multilevel cine MR imaging was performed in 10 normal volunteers and in 25 patients with aortic regurgitation documented and graded for severity by Doppler echocardiography. Cine MR images were analyzed to obtain cardiac chamber volumes and to measure the extent of the signal loss associated with regurgitation. All regurgitant lesions were visualized on cine MR images as areas of diastolic signal loss extending from the aortic valve into the left ventricle. The extent of signal loss and the regurgitant volume determined from analysis of MR images correlated with the echocardiographic severity of the lesion. The total area of diastolic left ventricular signal loss was 0 cm2 in 10 normal volunteers, 24 +/- 13 (+/- SD) cm2 in eight patients with mild aortic regurgitation, 49 +/- 11 cm2 in nine patients with moderate aortic regurgitation, and 62 +/- 20 cm2 in eight patients with severe aortic regurgitation (p less than .05 for moderate and severe vs mild). Left ventricular volumes calculated from MR images correlated well with echocardiographic volumes (r = .92, SEE = 30 ml, p less than .0001). Regurgitant fraction calculated from analysis of cine MR images was 4 +/- 7% in normal volunteers and 31 +/- 8% in mild, 45 +/- 11% in moderate, and 56 +/- 9% in severe aortic regurgitation (p less than .05 for moderate and severe vs mild and normal). Thus, cine MR imaging can provide useful qualitative and quantitative data regarding cardiac dimensions and regurgitant valvular flow in patients with aortic regurgitation.\r"

The angiograms were obtained because the patients were suspected of having coronary artery disease. In each case, the diagnosis of myxoma had been made earlier by echocardiography. Coronary angiography in five (55%) of the nine patients showed neovascularity in the tumor without calcification. In one patient, the angiogram showed a varix of the myocardium at the base of the tumor. The angiograms in three (33%) of the nine patients did not show neovascularity but showed tumoral calcification. Six (67%) of the nine patients had significant coronary artery disease that required coronary artery bypass grafting along with resection of the myxoma. These data suggest that the incidence of neovascularity in atrial myxomas is higher than previously reported. Furthermore, a significant number of this older population presented with operable artery disease as well as atrial myxoma.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the chest radiographs of 34 consecutive patients with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis to determine the presence of tracheomegaly and to follow its progression with time. Patients had been identified by a computer search of medical records. We measured the internal transverse diameter of the trachea 2 cm above the top of the aortic arch on erect posteroanterior chest radiographs. Transverse diameters greater than 25 mm in men and 21 mm in women were considered indicative of tracheomegaly. Pulmonary-function tests, available in 30 of the 34 patients, showed restrictive lung disease. The transverse tracheal measurements were compared with the cause of fibrosis, severity of restriction, duration of illness, and other clinical variables. Tracheomegaly was present in 10 (29%) of the patients, including four with fibrosing alveolitis, four with sarcoidosis, and two with chronic progressive histoplasmosis. In seven of these patients, serial radiographs showed that the tracheal dilatation had progressed with time. Nine of 24 patients without tracheomegaly also had progressive increase in transverse tracheal diameter over time. Of the 10 patients with tracheomegaly, pulmonary-function tests were available in eight and showed moderate restrictive lung disease in six and severe restrictive lung disease in two. The duration of illness was 3-6 months in two patients, 10-22 years in five patients, and not recorded in three patients. Chronic cough and repeated respiratory infections were slightly more common in those patients with tracheomegaly than in those without. These data suggest that tracheomegaly develops as a complication of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis in patients who have at least moderate restrictive lung disease and prolonged illness, and it may have some association with chronic cough and repeated respiratory infection.\r"

The patients were randomized to receive interleukin-2 alone or interleukin-2 in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells. Radiographs showed pulmonary edema in five of the eight patients. The changes ranged from mild interstitial edema (two patients) to frank pulmonary edema (three patients). The edema generally resolved within 4 days after the termination of therapy (four patients), however, one patient developed edema and arrhythmias approximately 7 days after interleukin-2 therapy ended. Seven of the eight patients had either cardiac arrythmias or angina. The mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of these cardiac complications with interleukin-2 therapy remain unclear. The development of pulmonary edema is thought to be caused by capillary leakage and cardiac pulmonary edema due to cardiac toxicity of the drug. The radiologic appearances of these types of pulmonary edema were indistinguishable from one another and from other causes of pulmonary edema. Our study shows that interleukin-2 can cause pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and unstable angina. The severity of these conditions is unrelated to dose.\r"

Embolization was performed either with bucrylate or with absolute ethanol and stainless-steel coils. Variceal hemorrhage was controlled in 245 (83%) of the 297 patients in whom percutaneous transhepatic embolization was performed as an emergency treatment. The 10-day survival rate in the series was 76%, with 97 deaths occurring shortly after the procedure as a result of recurrent bleeding or liver failure. The actuarial rate of recurrent bleeding was 55% at 6 months (38% Child's class B, 70% Child's class C) and 81% at 2 years (71% Child's class B, 90% Child's class C). One-half the cases of recurrent bleeding were easily controlled by medical treatment; 56% of these patients were still alive at 6 months (79% Child's class B, 42% Child's class C), 48% were alive at 1 year, and 26% were alive at 5 years. Results indicated that the survival rate was significantly higher (p less than .01) in Child's class B patients than in Child's class C patients during the 5-year follow-up period. The overall technical failure and complication rates were 9% and 7%, respectively, but these rates declined progressively as we gained more experience with the procedure. In this large series, transhepatic embolization was a safe, easy-to-perform, and effective treatment for the control of variceal bleeding and was somewhat more efficacious than previously reported.\r"

  ".W": "The first clinical results of using superparamagnetic ferrite particles as a tissue-specific contrast agent for MR of the liver are reported at high fields (1.5 T). Fifteen patients with proved secondary liver malignancies were studied with plain and contrast-enhanced MR. Superparamagnetic iron oxide was administrated IV in a dose of 20 mumol/kg. Intermediate TR, 820/30, 60 (TR/TE), and long TR, 2200/22, 70, spin-echo sequences were used before and 1 hr after injection of contrast material. Before injection, the largest number of lesions (437) was detected with the T2-weighted sequence. Lesion-to-liver contrast, expressed as the difference between the tumor and liver signal-to-noise, improved after ferrite administration in both sequences from -1 to 20 and from 7 to 15 for the 820/30, 60 sequence and from 9 to 34 and 15 to 21 for the 2200/22, 70 sequence. Despite this significant improvement in terms of the number of lesions detected, contrast-enhanced images did not show significantly more metastases than the unenhanced T2-weighted images did (383, 421, 407, and 407 vs as many as 437, respectively). In this limited study at 1.5 T, the benefit of ferrite enhancement was only marginal when postcontrast images were compared with heavily T2-weighted precontrast scans.\r"

Peritubal adhesions were diagnosed on hysterosalpingography by using the following radiographic criteria alone or in combination: (1) convoluted fallopian tube, (2) loculation of spillage of contrast medium into the peritoneal cavity, (3) ampullary dilatation, (4) peritubal halo effect (double-contour appearance of the tubal wall), and (5) vertical fallopian tube. The first 100 patients with the diagnosis of adhesions on hysterosalpingography who also had laparoscopy were included in the study. Seventy-five patients had the diagnosis confirmed on laparoscopy, resulting in a 25% false-positive diagnosis of adhesions with hysterosalpingography. Thirty-nine (52%) of these 75 patients had one radiographic finding alone, and 20 of these patients had loculation of spillage of contrast medium. Although the patients with adhesions tended to have two or more of the radiographic findings, the difference was not statistically significant. The most frequent radiographic findings found in combination were convoluted fallopian tube and loculation of spillage of contrast medium. These findings suggest that hysterosalpingography can be the diagnostic procedure of choice in the initial investigation of infertility due to peritubal adhesions.\r"

Voiding cystourethrography is therefore usually recommended as the initial radiologic study in children with urinary-tract infection. However, renal damage may occur also in the absence of reflux. The aim of this investigation was to determine the sensitivity and predictive value of reflux during voiding cystourethrography in identifying children at risk for renal damage. Eighty-four consecutive children, 2 months to 6 years old, with nonobstructive, first-known, febrile urinary-tract infection underwent voiding cystourethrography and urography. Twenty-seven (32%) had reflux and 10 (12%) had or developed renal damage. Two of the children and four of the kidneys with renal damage had no reflux at initial examination. The sensitivity of reflux as a marker for renal damage was 80%, specificity was 74%, positive predictive value was 30%, and negative predictive value was 96%. Thus, most children who develop renal damage after urinary-tract infection have reflux during voiding cystourethrography. However, there is a risk, albeit small, for renal damage to occur in the absence of reflux.\r"

  ".W": "To define the time course and mechanism of enhancement of epidural fibrosis after gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) injection, we undertook a three-part study in humans and dogs with epidural scar after spine surgery. First, the dynamic in vivo contrast-enhancing properties of epidural scar were assessed by using sequential fast (18-sec) spin-echo sequences after contrast injection. Epidural scar in dogs rapidly enhanced; peak enhancement (101%) was 6 min after injection, with a slower decline toward baseline to 45% after 44 min. Epidural fibrosis in patients followed a similar pattern, with a maximum enhancement of 73% after 5 min. Paraspinal muscle had a lower peak enhancement in both patients (36%) and dogs (22%). Second, vascular injection in two dogs with India ink demonstrated multiple small vessels throughout the epidural scar. Third, light and electron microscopy was performed on epidural scar obtained at reoperation in both patients and dogs. Light microscopy showed multiple small capillaries scattered throughout a background of collagen. Electron microscopy demonstrated a wide variation in the junctions between endothelial cells ranging from \"tight\" to \"loose.\" Regions of endothelial discontinuity were also visualized. This study suggests that Gd-DTPA diffuses rapidly into the extravascular space in epidural scar, with a slower, net movement toward the intravascular compartment as the agent is renally filtered. The contrast agent transgresses the endothelium through \"leaky\" intercellular junctions and areas of endothelial discontinuity.\r"

This study evaluates the MR appearance of the axial anatomy of the spinal cord and provides correlation to histologic sections as a means to understand this discordance so that disease can be recognized more readily. Short TR/TE spin-echo studies, cardiac-gated multiecho spin-echo studies, and gradient-refocused-echo studies of normal excised human spinal cords, a normal volunteer, and gelatin phantoms were obtained by using the same imaging parameters at 1.5 T. Imaging artifacts were further investigated by using both a 128 x 256 and 256 x 256 matrix with a varying phase-encoded axis. Histologic sections of the excised cords, which were stained for myelin, iron, and cell bodies (Nissl), were used for correlation to the images. We found that significant Fourier truncation and partial-volume imaging artifacts modulated the MR display of the cord. On short TR/TE images a ring of high signal at the periphery of the cord was due to a truncation artifact. The appearance of the central portions of the gray and white matter was affected variably by partial-volume averaging depending on the matrix size. White-matter tracts of the cord were always lower in signal than was the gray matter on all pulse sequences. This finding was not due to iron deposition or CSF motion artifacts. We suspect that this probably was related to dense, longitudinal organization of spinal tracts and resultant anisotropy of water molecule motion similar to that seen in the pyramidal tracts, tendons, and ligaments. We recommend the use of a 128 x 256 matrix with two averages (four excitations) when obtaining axial scans of the spinal cord in living subjects. Although truncation artifacts diminish image quality, the quality is superior to that of images obtained with a 256 x 256 matrix, in which longer scanning times result in motion artifacts and reduced signal to noise.\r"

The causes of the tethering were spinal lipomas (72%), tight filum terminale syndrome (12%), diastematomyelia (8%), and myelomeningocele (8%). These entities were readily identified in all instances. Bony dysraphisms were well demonstrated by MR. Interestingly, cavitary lesions/myelomalacia of the conus or the cord adjacent to the tethering lesion were seen with appropriate images in nine of 20 patients. This unexpected finding may have diagnostic and/or prognostic significance. Spinal MR was found to be extremely useful in the evaluation of the suspected tethered spinal cord. It was able to visualize the conus medullaris, assess the thickness of the filum terminale, identify traction lesions, and evaluate associated bony dysraphisms.\r"

In order to compare STIR and spin-echo imaging, we reviewed 90 lesions detected in 76 consecutive MR studies of the chest, liver, or pelvis performed at 1.5 T with both STIR and double-echo spin-echo techniques. Images were compared for the number of individual lesions detected. Lesion conspicuity was scored by using a subjective scale for each sequence. Lesion size was measured with hand-held calipers, and volume was calculated assuming a prolate ellipse. Because of inherent error in such calculations, lesions were judged to be similar in size (within 20%) or dissimilar (more than 20% difference). The presence of a lesion was proved by direct biopsy in 36 (40%), by tissue pathology from some other focus plus follow-up of the lesion in 37 (41%), or by other imaging plus follow-up in 12 (13%). STIR images detected five (6%) more lesions than spin echo and did not miss any of the lesions detected by spin echo. Conspicuity was greater on STIR images than on spin-echo images in 82 (91%) of the lesions. Twenty-six (29%) of the lesions appeared larger on STIR images than on spin-echo images. For these reasons, STIR may be a useful adjunct to spin echo for body MR in some cases. However, STIR images typically display lower signal-to-noise than spin-echo images do, and all abnormalities (tumor or edema) may appear equally bright on STIR.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities of left ventricular function during ischemia have been described in animal models and in humans. Exercise, while a physiologic means of inducing ischemia, has a complex effect on left ventricular function by itself. In addition, patients with coronary artery disease have a diversity of chronic changes in myocardial structure and function. Therefore, with use of micromanometer left ventricular pressure measurements and ventricular volumes, calculated from biplane cineangiograms, left ventricular function at rest and during exercise was studied in 57 patients. Exercise-induced ischemia produced a decrease in ejection fraction, an increase in end-systolic volume, dramatic increases in diastolic pressures and an upward shift in the diastolic pressure-volume relation. Central to these changes was abnormal myocardial contraction and relaxation, with reduced regional shortening and impaired left ventricular pressure decay. However, nonischemic areas were capable of augmented shortening, and global pressure decay did accelerate slightly. These findings demonstrate that exercise-induced adjustments in contraction and relaxation are intertwined with ischemia-related abnormalities. Exercise studies in patients after bypass surgery and in patients with scars from distant myocardial infarction were useful in clarifying confounding factors. For example, asynchrony of contraction and relaxation, and chronic changes in passive chamber properties, also compromise systolic and diastolic function during exercise. In patients with coronary artery disease without ischemia during exercise, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, but not early diastolic pressure, increased during exercise. The increase in pressure was appropriate for a slight increase in end-diastolic volume in a ventricle with a steep pressure-volume relation. Furthermore, end-systolic volume, while maintained during exercise, was not reduced, as occurs normally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bepridil immediately decreased coronary and systemic vascular resistance (26 and 17%, respectively). This resulted in a 19 and 21% reduction in left ventricular systolic and mean aortic pressures and a 15% increase in coronary flow and stroke index (p less than 0.05 vs control for each). These vasodilating effects were short lasting, persisting for 5 minutes after the bolus infusion, followed by significant reductions in heart rate (15%) and contractility (10%) and a temporary 46% increase in left ventricular filling pressure. During both pace tests heart rate, contractility, coronary flow and myocardial O2 consumption were comparable. In contrast, bepridil prevented the significant increase in systemic resistance and mean aortic pressure observed during pace test I (11 and 15%, respectively). Subsequently, myocardial O2 demand was significantly less during pacing after bepridil, due to an 11% reduction in left ventricular systolic pressure (p less than 0.05 vs control and pacing test II vs I). This resulted in marked antiischemic effects: normalization of lactate extraction and reduction in ST-segment depression (-14 +/- 7 vs 3 +/- 6% and 0.2 +/- 0.02 vs 0.13 +/- 0.02 mV, respectively, pace test I vs II, p less than 0.05), and in less or no angina in 18 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

LV volumes were calculated from simultaneous radionuclide-thermodilution measurements at rest (heart rate 82 +/- 12 beats/min), 10 minutes after the start of atrial pacing (100 beats/min), and with atrial pacing plus volume loading to return preload toward baseline. Atrial pacing reduced preload as reflected by LV end-diastolic volume index (69 +/- 14 vs 60 +/- 14 ml/m2, mean +/- standard deviation) (p less than 0.0001), but returned to baseline with volume loading. Afterload, as reflected by arterial end-systolic pressure, did not change with atrial pacing (63 +/- 9 at baseline vs 64 +/- 8 mm Hg with pacing, difference not significant). Afterload increased with volume loading (68 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.025 vs baseline and pacing). LV stroke volume decreased with atrial pacing due to reduced preload, but returned to baseline with volume loading. Cardiac index increased with atrial pacing and increased further with volume loading. Compared with baseline, LV end-systolic volume index was reduced during atrial pacing both before and after volume loading, despite unchanged or augmented afterload. The combination of atrial pacing and volume loading resulted in augmentation of LV stroke work, despite no increase in preload compared with baseline. Thus, after CABG, increased (paced) heart rate augments inotropic state, as indicated by reduced LV end-systolic volume under conditions of unchanged or increased afterload, and elevated LV stroke work without an increase in preload or a decrease in afterload.\r"

No kinetic differences were observed in the antibody response between A- and control Lewis rats. Retinol depletion more markedly reduced the antibody response of male rats than female rats despite equally low tissue retinol concentrations. For both strains, retinol repletion near the time of immunization normalized antibody production. When male Lewis rats were fed the A- diet longer, the antibody response of A- rats was only 3% of pair-fed controls; repletion again normalized antibody production. Thus, retinol supplementation near the time of immunization can restore the immune response in previously compromised A- rats.\r"

The effects of time (up to 24 hours) and temperature (25 degrees C vs. 35 degrees C) of test incubation as well as enzyme induction on Cefinase detection of beta-lactamase activity in clinical isolates of S. saprophyticus was investigated. Results were compared to beta-lactamase detection with the use of conventional nitrocefin and cloverleaf methods and with penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Of 85 S. saprophyticus isolates, 84 (98.8%) had penicillin MIC end points of greater than or equal to 0.25 microgram/mL. Beta-lactamase was detected by at least one method in 73 (85.9%) of the isolates: 63 (74.1%) by nitrocefin, 55 (64.7%) by cloverleaf, and 63 (74.1%) by Cefinase. Of Cefinase-positive isolates, 56 (88.9%) and 63 (100%) were detected at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively, and none required enzyme induction. At 35 degrees C, 4 (6.3%) and 19 (30.2%) of the Cefinase-positive isolates were detected at 1 hour and 24 hours, respectively.

In two cases, a provisional diagnosis of disseminated P. carinii infection was made by ophthalmologic examination. The characteristic fundus changes in this infection consisted of numerous slightly elevated, plaque-like, yellow-white lesions located in the choroid and unassociated with signs of intraocular inflammation. The diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem examination of the eyes and other organs. Histopathologically, the globes showed many choroidal infiltrates that were eosinophilic, acellular, vacuolated, and frothy. Several such infiltrates were noted within the choroidal vessels and choriocapillaries. Gomori's methenamine silver stain demonstrated many cystic and crescentic organisms. Electron microscopy disclosed thick-walled cystic organisms and large numbers of trophozoites.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in the morphology and histochemistry of vascular endothelial cells (EC) have been repeatedly observed at sites of chronic inflammation and immune reactions. These changes, which are most prominent in the EC postcapillary venules present in areas with large lymphocytic infiltrates, include the acquisition of a columnar or cuboidal morphology, the development of ribonuclease-sensitive metachromasia, and an increase in intracellular organelles. Thus, EC at sites of inflammation appear to be activated and to demonstrate increased metabolic activity. This study reports that both tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT) can activate cultured human umbilical vein EC, as measured by: 1) increased adhesiveness for lymphocytes, 2) increased cell metabolism, as measured by RNA and protein synthesis, and 3) increased cell volume. Although gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been shown previously to stimulate EC adhesiveness for lymphocytes, these two cytokines had only marginal effects on EC RNA and protein synthesis, and both caused a decrease in EC volume. These findings suggest that TNF and LT play a role in the type of activation of EC in vivo that leads to the development of tall endothelium and increased lymphocyte emigration.\r"

  ".W": "Electroconvulsive therapy can produce severe disturbances in the cardiovascular system, most commonly a transient period of hypertension. This study was designed to determine whether propofol, in comparison with methohexital, would attenuate this hypertensive response. Fifteen patients were studied during courses of six ECT administrations, each patient receiving propofol or methohexital on different occasions. Arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac rhythm were recorded. The induction doses were 1.08 +/- 0.03 mg.kg-1 of methohexital, and 1.60 +/- 0.04 mg.kg-1 of propofol. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and heart rate were consistently lower following propofol than methohexital (P less than 0.005). The mean maximum increase over baseline systolic pressure was 2.1 +/- 2.9 mmHg with propofol, and 26.7 +/- 4.5 mmHg with methohexital (P less than 0.001). Cardiac rhythm abnormalities were infrequent, and their incidence did not differ significantly between the two induction agents (P greater than 0.3). The duration of seizures, as measured clinically, was reduced with propofol (17.9 +/- 2.5 s) in comparison with methohexital (30.9 +/- 2.8 s) (P less than 0.001). Recovery times were similar for the two agents. Since the role of seizure duration in the therapeutic efficacy of ECT remains controversial, propofol may be a useful induction agent for this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanisms by which volatile anesthetics may depress myocardial contractility, the depressant effects of equivalent concentrations of isoflurane, enflurane and halothane were compared in rat and frog ventricular myocardium, preparations which differ markedly in excitation-contraction coupling. In Tyrode solution, right ventricular papillary muscles from rat exhibited very large, rapidly developing contractions after rest, with a subsequent negative force-frequency relation as the stimulation rate was increased to 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 Hz. The large contractions after rest and at 0.1 Hz were depressed by 0.75% halothane and 1.7% enflurane to about 60% of control, but less so by 1.3% isoflurane (approximately 0.8 MAC). Halothane at 1.5% was more depressant than 2.5% isoflurane at all stimulation rates, while 3.5% enflurane caused intermediate depression (approximately 1.6 MAC). Contractions in frog ventricular strips were studied in Ringer solution following rest and at stimulation rates of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 Hz, in the absence and presence of equivalent anesthetic concentrations. At 0.1 to 1 Hz, isoflurane was less depressant than equivalent concentrations of halothane. Enflurane (1.7%) was less depressant than 0.75% halothane at 0.1 and 0.25 Hz; 3.5% enflurane was more depressant than 2.5% isoflurane at 1 Hz. Anesthetic effects on sustained contractures were also studied in frog ventricular strips that were superfused for 4-5 min with 40, 60, 80, and 100 mM K Ringer solution. Contractures induced by 80 and 100 mM K solution were depressed more by halothane (to 60% of control) than by isoflurane or enflurane (approximately 85% of control). However, only enflurane depressed the contractions at 1 Hz more than the sustained contractures in 100 mM K Ringer. The Ca2+ for activating contractions in rat ventricle is derived largely from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and release organelle. In contrast, Ca2+ for activating contractions in the frog ventricle originates primarily from the external medium. These results suggest that halothane is more potent than isoflurane in reducing the amount of Ca2+ rapidly released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (as observed in rat), as well as in depressing entry of extracellular Ca2+ to activate myofibrils (as in frog). Enflurane appears to have intermediate potency with actions distinct from halothane and isoflurane. The greater potency of halothane may also be due in part to greater direct depression of actin-myosin ATPase.\r"

A 12-hour urine arsenic collection begun on admission showed 10,065 micrograms arsenic/12 hr. The patient received intramuscular BAL initially, which was followed by two ten-day courses of oral D-penicillamine. Complications included upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding requiring transfusion, transient elevations of liver function tests, self-limited complaints of decreased vision with conjunctival hyperemia and photophobia, and an abscess at the injection site. Although specific antidote therapy completely resolved the cyanide toxicity, early and prolonged arsenic chelation did not prevent a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy from developing with onset about 17 days after self-injection.\r"

When sufficient time was allowed for oxidized alpha 1PI to react with neutrophil elastase (2 h), enzyme-inhibitor complex formation could be demonstrated by three means: (1) inhibition of elastase activity, (2) detection of the complex using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for the native alpha 1PI-elastase complex, and (3) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which evidenced a complex with a molecular weight of 80,000. Porcine pancreatic elastase was not inhibited. Neutrophil-oxidized alpha 1PI behaved as an irreversible inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, as revealed by the kinetic analysis of the inhibition reaction. The rate constant for the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by neutrophil-oxidized alpha 1PI (0.76 +/- 0.22 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) was close to that for the inhibition of the enzyme by N-chlorosuccinimide-oxidized alpha 1PI (0.96 +/- 0.24 x 10(4) M-1 s-1), but it was more than three orders of magnitude lower than that for the reaction of native alpha 1PI with neutrophil elastase. Both native and oxidized alpha 1PI were temporary elastase inhibitors: the enzyme slowly and spontaneously escaped the complex with formation of an inactive alpha 1PI derivative with a molecular weight of 49,000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control subjects who were age-matched to patients with head and neck cancers did not show an altered IL-2 production in vitro, irrespective of whether they were accustomed to high alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking. Patients with cancer of the larynx did not differ significantly from control subjects. Most prominent was the significant reduction in IL-2 release of patients with cancer of the oropharynx and in patients with positive lymph nodes in the neck. Impaired IL-2 secretion in head and neck cancer patients may therefore be an additional prognostic indicator worthy of further investigation.\r"
