  ".W": "We evaluated the significance of bile seen in the stomach at the time of endoscopy. Twenty-three percent of 110 consecutive patients undergoing elective panendoscopy were found to have bile in their stomachs. Gastric biopsies were obtained from these patients. To assess the significance of bile reflux, the patients underwent a quantitative gastric bile analysis on two separate days. On day 1, gastric juice was aspirated by nasogastric suction, and bile acid concentrations were measured. On day 2, bile reflux into the stomach was quantitated by scintiscan measurement of gastric nucleotide after intravenous administration of 99mTc-DISIDA. Approximately half the patients with bile reflux showed histologic evidence of mucosal injury. However, fewer than half with histologic injury had significant bile reflux when measured by quantitative methods. There was no correlation among the gastric bile acid concentration, degree of histologic injury, or severity of endoscopic changes. We conclude that finding bile reflux at endoscopy is probably of no clinical significance.\r"

Of the 11 patients with a poor response, nine remained dependent on oral prednisone for remission of their colitis.

In an attempt to detect aneuploidy, we used high-resolution DNA histogram analysis with fluorescent DNA-specific stains and flow cytometry to evaluate 33 ascitic fluid samples. Of 13 patients with malignant ascites, aneuploidy was demonstrated in 10. Six patients with proven peritoneal carcinomatosis and normal cytologic examination had abnormal DNA histograms. DNA quantitation and cytologic examination agreed in 24 of 33 cases. These findings suggest that flow cytometry is a rapid and useful technique in the diagnosis of malignant ascites. The presence of aneuploidy in cells from ascitic fluid is highly suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis and suggests the need for further evaluation for malignancy.\r"

In contrast, oral pretreatment with cBSA greatly enhanced the anti-BSA response in animals subsequently challenged i.p. with either the cationized or native form of the molecule. The enhancement observed with cBSA pretreatment was more pronounced than the suppression observed with the same amount and number of feedings of nBSA. As little as a single oral dose of 10 mg of cBSA produced a significant increase in antibody concentration. Cell transfer of spleen cells into irradiated syngeneic recipients demonstrated that both T cells and B cells were involved in the generation of the response, with a greater degree of enhancement provided by cBSA-pretreated T cells. These data extend our previous findings and demonstrate that administration of cBSA by a normally \"tolerogenic\" route results in enhancement rather than suppression of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "An early event in death of interphase lymphocytes exposed in vivo or in vitro to low doses of gamma-irradiation is the degradation of DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments. Induction of fragmentation required RNA and protein synthesis because actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively, are able to inhibit DNA fragmentation in irradiated lymphocytes. Studies adding cycloheximide and actinomycin D at various times postirradiation suggest that once the metabolic process is initiated within an individual cell it proceeds to completion. The reversible RNA synthesis inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole inhibits DNA fragmentation in irradiated thymocytes. When this drug is removed after 6 hr, irradiated thymocytes proceed to fragment their DNA; this suggests that an inducing \"signal\" that is not simply mRNA persists within the irradiated cell for at least 6 hr after irradiation. In contrast to mitogen-activated T and B lymphoblasts, resting T and B cells show significant DNA fragmentation after exposure to 100 to 500 rad. At 2000 rad, all of the splenic subpopulations die rapidly via a different mechanism. By studying the mechanism of DNA fragmentation induced during the interphase death of lymphocytes, we hope to understand better the extreme sensitivity of resting lymphocytes to radiation and what may be the common final pathway of programmed cell death.\r"

We performed an extensive phenotypic and functional characterization of NK cells on 41 patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or \"chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection\" syndrome, and on 23 age- and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects in an attempt to further characterize this illness. These studies demonstrated that a majority of patients with CFS have low numbers of NKH1+T3- lymphocytes, a population that represents the great majority of NK cells in normal individuals. CFS patients had normal numbers of NKH1+T3+ lymphocytes, a population that represents a relatively small fraction of NK cells in normal individuals. When tested for cytotoxicity against a variety of different target cells, patients with CFS consistently demonstrated low levels of killing. After activation of cytolytic activity with recombinant interleukin 2, patients were able to display increased killing against K562 but most patients remained unable to lyse Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cell targets. Additional cytotoxicity experiments were carried out utilizing anti-T3 monoclonal antibody to block killing by NKH1+T3+ cells. These experiments indicated that the NK cell that appears to be responsible for much of the functional activity remaining in patients with CFS belongs to the NKH1+T3+ subset, which under normal circumstances represents only approximately 20% of the NK cell population.\r"

  ".W": "Five monoclonal antibodies reactive with human interferon (HuIFN)-alpha 2, but not with HuIFN-alpha 1, have been analyzed for their reaction with a series of IFN analogues and hybrid IFN molecules. Using analogues containing alpha 1 or gamma substitutions, it was shown that amino acids in the 107 to 113 region are implicated in the epitopes recognized by four of the five antibodies tested. Surprisingly, two of the antibodies that did not react with [alpha 1(113 to 114)112 to 113]alpha 2 also did not react with a truncated IFN-alpha 2(4 to 155). The presence of an epitope determined by amino acids at 112 and 113 and by the amino and carboxyl ends of the molecule supports a model for IFN where the carboxyl- and amino-terminals are adjacent to the proposed reverse turn around amino acid 110 to 115. The fifth alpha 2 specific antibody whose reaction with HuIFN-alpha 2 is not affected by the above substitutions and truncations recognizes IFN or IFN hybrids that, like alpha 2, have arginine at position 120, but does not react with IFN that, like alpha 1, have lysine at position 120. Amino acids 107 to 113 and 120 lie in regions of the molecule that have high hydrophilicity and are probably structurally involved in the epitopes recognized by the antibodies. Under conditions of antibody excess, the antibodies described here inhibit binding of HuIFN-alpha 2 to both human and bovine cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cytoplasts (enucleated neutrophils which are depleted of dense granules) were prepared from human neutrophils with a modified procedure which employed dihydrocytochalasin B instead of cytochalasin B. These cytoplasts retained an activatable cytoskeletal network similar to cells in that filamentous actin polymerization in response to an N-formylpeptide (fluoresceinated N-formyl-nle-leu-phe-nle-tyr-lys, FLPEP) occurred with similar dose-response characteristics and was inhibitable by cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B. Cytoplasts had the same number of receptors per surface area as cells and binding constants and dissociation kinetics were the same for cells and cytoplasts. The conversion of receptors from a rapidly dissociating form to a slowly dissociating form was comparable in cells and cytoplasts. This conversion was not inhibited by cytochalasins and thus did not require actin polymerization. Cytoplasts were capable of internalizing 30% of bound FLPEP after 3 min of binding. Cytochalasins did not block this internalization which thus did not appear to require actin polymerization. After 5 min of binding, [3H]-N-formyl-met-leu-phe cosedimented with the Golgi marker enzymes when cytoplasts were fractionated on sucrose density gradients after N2 cavitation. These results indicate that the internalization mechanism is functional in cytoplasts. The Indo-1-detectable calcium response in cytoplasts had a ED50 similar to cells, though the maximum increase in Ca2+ concentration was about one-half that of cells. The response recovered with time after stimulation and the calcium detected was primarily from intracellular stores. The decay of responses after addition of formylpeptide antagonists was parallel for cells and cytoplasts, and leukotriene B4-induced responses in both cells and cytoplasts. Thus the regulation of the responses in cells and cytoplasts was analogous.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody was developed against an 8,000-kDa enzyme-releasing peptide (ERP) released from human alveolar macrophages. ERP was isolated on an immunoaffinity column containing the antibody bound to staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose. Release of ERP from the macrophages is not changed by plastic adherence, phagocytosis, calcium ionophore, or phorbol esters. The peptide was not antigenically similar to interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, or interleukin 1 alpha or 1 beta. The release of constituents from azurophilic and specific granules was the main identified biologic function of ERP. ERP was a more effective secretagogue in the untreated neutrophils and f-met-leu-phe was more effective in the cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. Absorption of ERP from macrophage-conditioned medium removed a small amount of the chemotactic activity; however, the immunopurified peptide was not chemotactic or chemokinetic for neutrophils, and at high concentrations, it suppressed base line chemokinesis. Treatment of washed macrophages with trypsin released active ERP of approximately the same m.w. of spontaneously secreted ERP. These studies showed that human alveolar macrophages release a peptide which is a secretagogue for human neutrophils under conditions which may be encountered in the lungs during certain disease states. Proteolytic enzymes which are free in the lungs may release the peptide and lead to the secretion of neutrophil enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The undecapeptide substance P (SP) contained in primary afferent nerves is thought to mediate that part of the neurogenic inflammatory response consisting of vasodilation and plasma extravasation. This response is diminished in rats pretreated as neonates with the neurotoxin capsaicin. It is not known whether primary afferent nerves influence cellular responses of the immune response to antigenic stimulation. Using 6- to 12-wk-old Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated as neonates with capsaicin, we examined the regional lymph node response to a s.c. antigenic stimulus of sheep red blood cells. The number of cells secreting antigen-specific antibody in these animals was reduced by more than 80% using direct and indirect plaque assay methods. The reduced antibody response in capsaicin-pretreated animals was reversed by a s.c. infusion of SP given over a 4-hr period at the injection site immediately after antigen stimulation. This response had a threshold at approximately 1.0 X 10(-5) M SP. SP1-7 (1.0 X 10(-5) M) was without effect but an infusion of SP5-11 (1.0 X 10(-5) M) reversed the effects of capsaicin treatment indicating a carboxyl-terminal effect of SP. The results suggest that the reduced response of capsaicin-treated animals to an antigenic stimulus is due to an effect of capsaicin on the SP-containing primary afferent nerves rather than a toxic effect of capsaicin on the immune system.\r"

Biologic activities of the purified cytokine were monitored by either an enzyme release assay or a chemotaxis assay, using peripheral human neutrophils. Purified MONAP was found to be homogeneous, giving a single peak on size-exclusion HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC, as well as a single 10-kDa band on silver-stained polyacrylamide gels. Purified MONAP stimulate human neutrophil chemotaxis at an estimated molarity of 5 x 10(-11) M. Half-maximal enzyme release of cytochalasin B pretreated neutrophils occurred at 2 to 3 x 10(-10) M, whereas superoxide anion production elicited by various concentrations of MONAP was found to be low. Isolated human peripheral monocytes, as well as human eosinophils, showed no chemotactic response to MONAP, indicating neutrophil specificity. MONAP activity was separated from thymocyte-stimulating activity by reversed-phase HPLC, indicating nonidentity with interleukin (IL)-1. This was further supported by heat resistance of MONAP, which is in contrast to the heat sensitivity of IL-1. In addition, IL-1 obtained as a by-product during isolation of MONAP did not stimulate human neutrophil chemotaxis.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the concept of a common mucosal immune system wherein mucosal associated lymphocytes traffic among the various mucous membranes, the murine gastrointestinal tract was immunized with Sendai virus antigens in order to elicit a virus-specific immune response in the respiratory tract. Multiple intragastric (oral) administration of live or killed Sendai virus induced IgA and IgG antiviral antibodies in both gastrointestinal secretions and serum. When cholera toxin as an adjuvant was included along with virus, gut IgA and IgG as well as serum IgA responses were enhanced. Antiviral antibodies induced in respiratory secretions by oral killed virus plus cholera toxin, however, were variable and protection from virus challenge was not demonstrated. Significantly higher levels of respiratory antiviral antibodies were induced if immunization with oral killed Sendai virus/cholera toxin was combined with intranasal administration of small amounts of killed virus. The combined immunization also resulted in protection of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts from virus infection. Protection of the upper respiratory tract was correlated with the presence of IgA antiviral antibodies in nasal washings. On the other hand, protection of the lower respiratory tract was correlated with IgG antiviral antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Immunization with intranasal killed virus alone conferred partial protection to the lower respiratory tract and no protection to the upper respiratory tract. Thus, oral immunization with killed virus antigen could prime for a protective immune response in the murine respiratory tract and this protective response included IgA antibodies.\r"

The present study demonstrates that cardiac myosin itself induces severe myocarditis and high titers of myosin autoantibodies in A/J, A.SW/SnJ, and A.CA/SnJ mice. As in CB3-induced myocarditis, one population of these autoantibodies was specific for cardiac myosin. A.BY/SnJ and B10.A/SgSnJ mice also developed the disease after immunization, but the prevalence and the myosin autoantibody titers were lower. In contrast, C57BL/6J and C57BL/10J mice were resistant to myocarditis induced by cardiac myosin and did not develop increased myosin autoantibodies or cardiac myosin-specific autoantibodies. Immunization with skeletal muscle myosin had no effect compared with controls injected with complete Freund's adjuvant, thereby suggesting that the immunogenic epitopes are unique to the cardiac myosin isoform. Furthermore, we found that susceptibility to myocarditis induced by cardiac myosin is influenced by the major histocompatibility complex and by genes not closely linked to the major histocompatibility complex. Because there are parallels between myocarditis induced by cardiac myosin and that induced by CB3, this new animal model can be used to analyze the pathologic mechanisms in autoimmune heart disease.\r"

Appreciable or potent anti-allo-delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were observed when mice were inoculated i.v. with untreated allogeneic cells or inoculated i.v. with those cells followed by s.c. immunization with untreated allogeneic cells. In contrast, i.v. inoculation of neuraminidase-treated allogeneic cells (presensitization) not only failed to induce any significant anti-allo-DTH responses but also abolished the capability of the animals to develop DTH responses after s.c. immunization, indicating the tolerance induction. This tolerance was alloantigen-specific, and rapidly inducible and long lasting. The induction of suppressor cell activity was demonstrated in tolerant mice. However, this activity was associated only with the tolerant state around 4 to 7 days after the i.v. presensitization, but was no longer detected in mice more than 14 days after the presensitization, although these mice exhibited complete tolerant state. When spleen cells from such tolerant mice were transferred i.v. into 600 R x-irradiated syngeneic recipient mice alone or together with normal syngeneic spleen cells, these tolerant spleen cells themselves failed to induce DTH responses but did not exhibit suppressive effect on the generation of DTH responses induced by normal spleen cells co-transferred. These results indicate that i.v. administration of neuraminidase-treated allogeneic cells results in the induction of alloantigen-specific tolerance which is not always associated with the induction of suppressor cell activity but rather with the elimination or functional impairment of alloantigen-specific clones.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of presentation of foreign antigens to helper T lymphocytes and the nature of the structures involved in this process are not totally understood. It is well documented that this event is carried out by antigen-presenting cells (APC) (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes) that internalize the antigen, process it, reexpress it on their membrane surface, and present it to the T cell in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II (Ia) molecules. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that peptide antigens associate directly with Ia molecules on the APC surface membrane. However, the characteristics of other APC membrane structures potentially involved in antigen presentation are not entirely clear. Previous studies in our laboratories identified a guinea pig macrophage membrane-bound, non-Ia-containing antigenic complex (peak A) formed upon incubation of APC with the octapeptide antigen angiotensin (AII). This complex was capable of stimulating AII-immune guinea pig T cells and thus appeared to contain the immunologically relevant form of the antigen. For this reason it was important to establish whether such complex formation with peptides occurs with other cell types and with other peptide antigens. In the present study we found that other types of cells are also capable of forming such a membrane complex with antigen (peak A) and that this event is not unique to AII. Two other peptides, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and human fibrinopeptide B, both of which are antigenic in mice, were found to form peak A with a number of murine cell lines. As in our earlier studies with guinea pig macrophages, there was no evidence from these experiments for a role for major histocompatibility complex Ia antigens in the peptide binding observed. Differences in both the amount of peak A formation and the pattern of peptide antigen degradation were found from cell line to cell line for a given peptide, and from peptide to peptide for a given cell line, suggesting cellular heterogeneity in peptide processing and retention. In addition, cross-inhibition studies indicated that there was peptide specificity in the formation of peak A perhaps suggestive of molecular heterogeneity in the structure of peak A. These results indicate that there may be several types of cell surface molecules that specifically bind and retain peptide antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, the immunologic processes responsible for the patterns of IgG subclasses stimulated by antigens are probably complex and are certainly unclear. To define some of the genetic controls of IgG subclass expression in mice, we have studied the patterns of IgG subclasses elicited by antigens in BALB/cAn, C57BL/6N, derived recombinant inbred strains, and derived Ig congenic strains. This study shows that both thymus-independent antigens and thymus-dependent antigens stimulate different patterns of IgG subclasses in BALB/cAn and C57BL/6N. Furthermore, analysis using recombinant inbred strains and Ig congenic strains shows that the patterns of IgG subclasses stimulated by all antigens are linked to Ig allotype. In contrast, only the IgG subclass patterns stimulated by thymus-dependent antigens are linked to major histocompatibility complex haplotype. This study also shows that the Ig allotype-linked controls of IgG subclass response patterns are located telomeric to a BAB14 intra-heavy chain variable region recombinant site. Therefore, this region of mouse chromosome 12 may contribute to the control of IgG subclass selection in the B cell.\r"

In order to characterize the carboxypeptidase A present in the BMMC, a sensitive assay was developed that used angiotensin I as the substrate and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography to separate and quantify production of the cleavage product des-leu-angiotensin I. Using this assay, mouse BMMC carboxypeptidase A had a neutral to basic pH optimum and hydrolyzed angiotensin I with a Km of 0.78 mM. The antigen-induced net percent release of carboxypeptidase A from IgE-sensitized BMMC was proportional to that of the secretory granule component beta-hexosaminidase which indicates a secretory granule location for the exopeptidase. As defined by exclusion during Sepharose CL-2B chromatography, carboxypeptidase A was exocytosed as a greater than 1 X 10(7) m.w. complex bound to proteoglycans. Because BMMC cocultured with mouse skin-derived 3T3 fibroblasts are known to undergo an increase in histamine content and biosynthesis of 35S-labeled heparin proteoglycans, carboxypeptidase A activity was measured during BMMC/fibroblast coculture for 0 to 28 days. The carboxypeptidase A activity increased progressively during 28 days of co-culture from 0.004 +/- 0.002 U/10(6) starting BMMC (mean +/- SE, n = 3) to 0.36 +/- 0.10 U/10(6) co-cultured mast cells. These findings indicate that carboxypeptidase A, a neutral protease, is exocytosed from the secretory granules of mouse mast cells bound to proteoglycan and is increased during the in vitro differentiation of mouse BMMC from mucosal-like mast cells to serosal-like mast cells.\r"

Increases in adherence, phagocytosis, hydrogen peroxide release, and lysozyme secretion have been demonstrated after prolonged incubation of human neutrophils with TNF. In this study, the ability of highly purified recombinant human TNF to modulate neutrophil responses to soluble stimuli was evaluated. Tumor necrosis factor alone (0.1 to 10,000 units/ml) failed to induce neutrophil superoxide anion (O2-) production, granule release, or aggregation when incubated for up to 25 min at 37 degrees C. TNF did, however, stimulate a significant time-, dose-, and temperature-dependent increase in neutrophil F-actin content. Although exposure of neutrophils to TNF alone caused no superoxide anion production, it enhanced the O2- production in response to the chemotactic peptide, f-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or the tumor promotor, phorbol myristate acetate, by as much as 278%. The enhancement was time-, dose-, and temperature-dependent and was due to a more rapid initial rate of O2- production. The TNF enhancement of FMLP-induced O2- production was blocked when an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody 241-1H11, is present during the preincubation period. TNF preincubation also enhanced FMLP-induced lysozyme release, but had no effect on aggregation and actin polymerization by FMLP. The kinetics of NADPH oxidase activation by arachidonic acid was unaltered by TNF. These results indicate that brief exposures to recombinant human TNF are able to enhance or prime the neutrophil oxidative burst in response to a second stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "The three active serum amyloid A (SAA) genes of mice, SAA 1, SAA 2, and SAA 3, are coordinately expressed in liver during acute and chronic inflammatory stimulation and experimental amyloidosis. The genes, primarily SAA 3, are also expressed extrahepatically. The apoprotein SAA 2 is the precursor of the amyloid A (AA) fibril protein that is deposited as insoluble fibrils extracellularly in spleen and other organs when amyloidosis occurs secondarily to inflammation. The exact cause of AA fibril formation is unknown. Amyloid enhancing factor is a high m.w. glycoprotein extracted from amyloidotic organs. Administration of amyloid enhancing factor alters experimental inflammation to bring about accelerated deposition of amyloid A fibrils first in spleen and later in other organs. In this study, hepatic and extrahepatic expression of the SAA genes were compared during accelerated amyloidosis relative to inflammation uncomplicated by amyloidosis. Differences in kinetics and pattern of SAA gene expression by resident peritoneal macrophages and liver were detected during four dissimilar inflammatory episodes. Macrophages expressed the SAA 3 gene solely, and to a greater extent in chronic than in acute inflammation. In accelerated amyloid induction, macrophage SAA 3 expression increased as SAA 1 and SAA 2 expression in liver decreased. However, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein expression remained elevated throughout the course of amyloid induction. The greatly increased expression of the SAA 3 gene by macrophages and decreased expression of the SAA 1 and SAA 2 genes in liver during amyloidosis, suggests that altered SAA gene expression may play a pathogenetic role in experimental amyloid deposition.\r"

H-2Kk from both the C3H and AKR strains, H-2Kd, H-2Kb, H-2Dk, H-2Ld, H-2Dd, H-2Db, and H-2Dp DNA sequences were aligned, and the alignments used to construct phylogenetic trees inferring the evolutionary relationships among the nine genes by two independent methods. Both approaches yielded trees with similar topologies. In addition, the sequence alignments revealed patterns of nucleotide substitutions which implicate both point mutation and recombination in the divergence of the H-2 genes. Future considerations for evolutionary analysis of class I genes are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In moderately colored guinea-pig skin, UVB, PUVA (psoralen plus UVA), and allergic contact dermatitis were shown to induce visibly well-defined hyperpigmentation that resembled the pigmentary changes observed in Mongoloid human skin. To clarify mechanisms of allergen-induced hyperpigmentation, we compared the effects of allergic contact dermatitis on pigmentation by using 6 different allergens: dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (PAN), benzyl salicylate (BS), jasmine oil (JO), hydroxycitronella (HC), and ylang ylang oil (YYO). The PAN-, JO-, HC-, and YYO-induced allergic reactions caused a definite visible hyperpigmentation that began to appear within 14 days, reaching maximum intensity about 40 days after the induction of the allergic reaction. These hyperpigmentations were accompanied by a significant increase in the population of dopa-positive melanocytes on day 24 following allergic reactions. In contrast, BS- and DNCB-induced allergic reactions did not give rise to visibly distinct hyperpigmentation in spite of the intensive allergic reactions following their challenge application. In a nonsensitized group, primary irritant reactions were induced by the application of 100% JO, but no distinctive hyperpigmentation was found 40 days after the last application. Quantitative analysis of the number of melanophages in the dermis showed that there was a marked increase in the number of melanophages in PAN, YYO, and HC allergy-induced hyperpigmented areas, with PAN showing a significant increase compared with those in non-treated areas of the same animals, whereas JO was associated with no such increase in hyperpigmented area, despite the stimulated pigmentation. In the case of the lack of induced hyperpigmentation, as seen in BS and DNCB allergy and JO irritation, there was also no substantial increase in the number of melanophages. Our findings indicate that allergic contact dermatitis is a unique melanogenic stimulant different from UV irradiation.\r"

At 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after wounding, thrombospondin is present primarily at the cut edges of the lateral and deep margins of the wound. It appears to be cleared from these extracellular matrix sites, and is no longer detectable in those sites in most 14-day-old wounds. Thrombospondin staining is present, however, in increased amounts around the vascular channels within and adjacent to the 7- and 14-day wounds in increased amounts relative to vascular channels distant from the wound. Our observations are consistent with known in vitro data regarding the binding of thrombospondin to fibrin and components of the extracellular matrix, as well as with data showing that proliferating endothelial cells secrete more thrombospondin than quiescent endothelial cells. These data support the hypothesis that thrombospondin plays a role in the early organization of the extracellular matrix of wounds.\r"

Its karyotype has remained 47,XY, +8. The current NM1 cells make readily detectable amounts of 67 kd and 48 kd keratins, and it has been established that the previously poorly resolved 58 kd band actually consists of 58 kd and 59 kd bands. We have also found that the apparent 56 kd band consists of the 56 kd and 56.5 kd bands. A unique basic polypeptide precursor of the cornified envelope has been discovered in the NM1 line. Although similar in charge to one in normal cells it is lower in molecular weight.\r"

  ".W": "A new method for determination of cholesterol sulfate (CS) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) from 1 ml serum by reverse phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is described. The method comprises an isolation step of sulfated steroids by means of octadecylsilane-bonded (C18) reverse phase column chromatography, a solvolysis step for desulfation of sulfated steroids, and a C18 TLC step for measurement on a photodensitometer. This method is much simpler and more rapid than the methods previously reported, since neither a radioisotope is needed, nor any steps of saponification, derivatization, tedious scraping from a TLC plate, and time-consuming conventional column chromatography are not required. The present method allowed us to distinguish recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI) very easily from ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) by the size and gradation of clearly visible blue chromogen derived from CS on a TLC plate in RXLI. By photodensitometer scanning, the CS levels in patients with RXLI were about 10 times higher than those of patients with IV and healthy subjects, whereas the DHEAS level was normal in the RXLI patients. The present simplified method proved to be useful in diagnosis of RXLI.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the nature of melanosomal protein in normal and malignant melanocytes, two mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), designated MoAb HMSA-3 and MoAb HMSA-4, were developed by the solubilized melanosomes of human malignant melanoma. The specificity of the two MoAbs was characterized immunohistochemically by comparison with that of MoAb HMSA-2 in various forms of melanoma tissues. MoAb HMSA-3 and MoAb HMSA-4 were IgM, k subclass while MoAb HMSA-2 was IgG1, k subclass. The three MoAbs possessed many similarities; (a) positive reactivity in formalin-fixed and paraffin-processed specimens, (b) identification of cytoplasmic antigen(s) in melanoma cells, (c) negative reactivity with normal epidermal melanocytes on paraffin-sections, and (d) intense reaction with amelanotic melanoma cells, particularly in superficial spreading and acral lentiginous melanoma and in metastatic lymph nodes. The three MoAbs, however, identified the different cells on the same serial sections, suggesting that the three may recognize the different epitopes. Thus in 32 cases of primary and metastatic melanomas examined, one of the three MoAbs always showed a positive reactivity, though the other two were negatively or weakly reacted. Our study indicated that the melanosomal protein may provide a unique source to develop MoAbs which identify malignant melanocytes on routine paraffin sections.\r"

Electron microscopy of nine hemangiomas revealed a pronounced thickening of the basement membrane (0.6 to 14 micron) in 93% of the total 158 vascular structures examined within the lesions. This increase was caused mainly by multiple layers of basal lamina, which were irregular in outline and frequently associated with pericytes. Basement membrane changes were present both in the periphery of the hemangiomas, as well as in the center of the lesions. Immature vessels could not be identified and mitoses were absent in all endothelial cells. Using an immunohistochemical marker (Ki67) specific for proliferating cells in G2 and S phases, positive staining was not found in the endothelial cells lining the hemangiomatous vessels, whereas basal epidermal keratinocytes in the same preparations and cultured microvascular endothelial cells expressed the antigen. Endothelial cells of nine hemangiomas did not stain with an activation-related antibody (E12) specific for endothelial cells. When endothelial cells from 14 hemangiomas were isolated and cultured under conditions that support the growth of normal human skin microvascular endothelial cells, the cells of hemangiomatous origin failed to grow. We conclude that the adult hemangiomas may not be true neoplasms, but a tissue overgrowth composed of mature vessels resembling dermal venules, lined by endothelial cells with virtually no turnover.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid, in vivo measurement of the penetration of antiviral compounds into the skin would improve our ability to predict the therapeutic efficacy of topical treatments for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We have studied the concentration of iododeoxyuridine (IDU) in the stratum corneum of guinea pig skin by tape stripping at different time points after single and multiple topical doses of the drug. These results were correlated with the efficacy of topical IDU against an experimental cutaneous HSV infection. Ten adhesive tape strippings were performed on depilated guinea pig dorsum in vivo at serial intervals after a single topical dose of [3H]IDU. Iododeoxyuridine levels in the stratum corneum peaked at 1-3 h (67-70 mg/g of tissue) and then gradually declined over the next 3-24 h. We hypothesized that the peak IDU stratum corneum concentration would correlate with therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we determined the quantity of IDU in guinea pig stratum corneum 2 h after a topical application of seven different concentrations of IDU in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and examined the in vivo efficacy of these formulations in an experimental dorsal cutaneous HSV-1 infection in guinea pigs. The results showed an excellent correlation between the quantity of IDU in the stratum corneum and reduction in lesion severity (r = 0.95-0.97). Fifteen percent IDU in DMSO provided the highest therapeutic efficacy (90-94%). We also studied the relationship between the clinical efficacy of different dosing frequencies and the amount of IDU in the stratum corneum. Serial IDU stratum corneum concentrations were measured over 24 h following 1, 2, 3, or 4 applications per day of 1, 3, and 15% IDU in DMSO treatments and parallel efficacy studies of the different regimens were conducted in the animal model. Within each dosing frequency, the cumulative amount of drug in the stratum corneum correlated with the strength of the test formulation and with efficacy in the animal model. For each of the three formulations, increasing the number of daily doses from one up to three led to progressive increases in cumulative stratum corneum IDU levels and clinical efficacy. An increase in the number of daily applications to four had little effect on drug efficacy and was associated with a plateau in stratum corneum IDU levels. Stratum corneum IDU concentrations were rapid and easy to determine and correlated well with clinical events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It is therefore important to determine the mechanisms by which ultraviolet light alters normal cellular functions. The potential importance of ultraviolet light-induced damage to non-DNA targets has received little attention. Since the cytoskeleton is an important participant in the control of normal cell growth, the microfilaments and microtubules of UV irradiated human skin fibroblasts have been studied using fluorescence microscopy. Polychromatic ultraviolet light, composed of environmentally relevant wavelengths, was found to disrupt the cytoplasmic microtubule complex in a dose dependent manner. The induction of microtubule disassembly did not correlate with the cytotoxicity of ultraviolet light of varying composition.\r"

Some animals were observed for a 15 week post-irradiation period. A wide range of statistical analyses has shown that, during the course of irradiation, the inclusion of sunscreens eliminates the enhancement of phototumorigenesis and malignancy that is normally observed with 5-methoxypsoralen. There was, however, some indication of increased risk at the end of the postirradiation follow-up period. Possible reasons for the protective effect of the sunscreens and the relevance of these data to the assessment of human risk are discussed.\r"

Six additional biopsies from 4 patients treated with recombinant alpha A interferon were obtained after treatment. Varying amounts of two proliferating cell populations were found: (1) Large cells showing cytologic and histochemical characteristics of endothelial cells. They were seen in close proximity to normal vessels, forming new vascular structures and large aggregates found in papular and nodular lesions. (2) Smaller spindle-shaped cells, probably of pericytic origin. They appeared in bundles and fascicles in the papillary dermis of the cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and, in part, gave origin to thin-walled, bizarre-shaped vessels that show incomplete lumina proliferating from the upper to the deep dermis and are surrounded by extravasate erythrocytes and siderophages. After long-term systemic treatment with recombinant alpha A interferon, the endothelial type of tumor cell aggregates mostly disappeared, whereas most of the spindle-shaped pericytic-like cells were still present. Our findings lead us to suggest that some cellular product may, as a promoter factor, induce the proliferation and growth of endothelial cells. This factor may be blocked by alpha A interferon and cause regression of endothelial cell proliferation observed in AIDS patients undergoing long-term systemic therapy.\r"

Plasma concentrations in patients receiving dialysis ranged between 5.9 and 582 ng/ml and appeared not to be significantly affected by dialysis. The number of prior doses and the elimination half-life estimated from the terminal slope were correlated (r = .81, P = .025), and the results suggested that the current assay technology is still not sensitive enough to detect true elimination half-life. Trough plasma concentrations ranged between 4.3 and 67.5 ng/ml (28.4 +/- 26.6 ng/ml) in patients who had received prior doses of pentamidine, a result suggesting that drug accumulation occurs with multiple dosing. The data suggest that dosage adjustments are not necessary with creatinine clearances of greater than 35 ml/min. Because multiple dosing leads to increased trough concentrations and drug accumulation, lower dose regimens may still be efficacious, yet associated with reduced toxicity.\r"

Cervical scrape specimens were screened for the presence of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31 DNA by using three different blot hybridization methods. Specimens from 26 (11.1%) of 234 patients contained HPV DNA sequences. HPV-16 and -31 were detected in six specimens each, whereas HPV-6, -11, and -18 were each identified in three specimens. Five additional specimens contained HPV DNA sequences of undetermined type. Only two of the 26 positive specimens were obtained from patients with genital warts; an additional 12 specimens were from patients with cytological abnormalities. We conclude that cervical HPV infections in some pregnant populations are common and that many such infections are not clinically apparent.\r"

Annual incidence of each serotype varied greatly, with types 2 and 5 predominating before 1975 and type 1 thereafter. Exposure to adenovirus in the day care center correlated with acquisition of infection. Through two years of age, children were exposed to 3.4 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) different serotypes and became infected by 2.1 +/- 0.8 different types. Most infections occurred before the child's second birthday, and incidence was highest from six to 12 months of age (1.4 primary infections/child-year). Mild and febrile illness accompanied 75% of primary isolations. Otitis media occurred in 37% of illnesses over all ages and in greater than 50% of illnesses among infants.\r"

CP levels increased at day 3 to a geometric mean level of 47 ng/ml, at day 6 to 389 ng/ml, at day 8 to 537 ng/ml, and thereafter persisted in that range. On days 1, 3, and 6, CP was not detectable (less than 0.16 ng/ml) in the serum, but on days 8, 10, or 13, CP was present in 15 (58%) of 26 animals; the median peak level of serum CP among these animals was 2.00 ng/ml (range, 0.31-5.90 ng/ml).

Serovar E was the predominant serovar in cervical isolates (32%) but was found in only 6% of rectal isolates (P less than .0001). Serovars B, I/I', H, and K were isolated from 2%-7% of cervical specimens but were not found in rectal isolates. There was a significant decline in the proportion of rectal infections caused by serovar D/D' over the study period, and clustering of infections caused by other serovars was observed. Serotyping using monoclonal antibodies provides a powerful tool for investigating the epidemiology of sexually transmitted C. trachomatis infections.\r"

Three of five volunteers infected with GS/M became ill, including two who had diarrhea and typical symptoms of giardiasis. In the second study, three patients who were previously infected with GS/M and treated were rechallenged 12 weeks after the first inoculation, together with five new control volunteers. All of the latter group became infected, and two developed loose stools; two rechallenged volunteers became reinfected but were asymptomatic, and a third was retrospectively found to be infected at the time of challenge. Serum IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody responses to Giardia and intestinal fluid IgA antibody responses to Giardia occurred in 100%, 70%, 60%, and 50%, respectively, of infected volunteers.

This could be attributable to renal wasting of calcium, decreased intestinal calcium absorption, or decreased bone resorption, processes that are integrated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D systems. We have studied the calcemic response to PTH infusion (3 U/hr/100 gm) for 5 hours in 13-week-old SHR and WKY. Pre-PTH Pca++ concentration of nonfasted SHR (4.68 +/- 0.06 mg/dl, N = 8) was significantly lower than that of WKY (4.84 +/- 0.03, N = 8, P less than 0.05). Pca++ concentration rose in both nonfasted WKY and SHR at the end of PTH infusion, but the increment of Pca++ in SHR (0.29 +/- 0.05 mg/dl, N = 8) was lower than that in WKY (Pca++, 0.60 +/- 0.07 mg/dl, N = 8, P less than 0.01). Urinary calcium excretion (UcaV) and creatinine clearances (Ccr) before and after PTH infusion were not different between WKY and SHR. Despite an increased filtered load of calcium, UcaV was not greater in either WKY or SHR during the PTH infusion. Pretreatment of SHR with calcitriol 50 ng intravenous bolus injection, which had no effect on Pca++ concentration (0.02 +/- 0.03 mg/dl, N = 7), corrected the lower calcemic response to PTH in SHR, and the Pca++ increment was no longer different between WKY (0.57 +/- 0.07 mg/dl, N = 7) and SHR (0.62 +/- 0.09, N = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although heterozygotes are not anemic, they have half normal levels of circulating transferrin, and they become siderotic late in life. In the mouse, weekly injections of mouse or human serum, or of highly purified transferrin, permit survival and alleviate the anemia. The pattern of inheritance, clinical features, time course and distribution of parenchymal iron, and nature and stability of the endogenous transferrin are presented. The data indicate that the gene hpx produces wholly normal strain-specific transferrin but in small amounts. The hpx gene is closely linked with the transferrin locus, Trf, on chromosome 9.\r"

  ".W": "A plastic (Plexiglas) chamber for evaluating platelet deposition under controlled hemodynamic conditions has been developed. The perfusion chamber has been designed to retain the cylindrical shape typical of the vasculature, to be flexible enough to accept a variety of biologic and prosthetic materials, and to simulate a broad range of physiologic flow conditions in either an ex vivo or in vitro perfusion system. Three type of surfaces were exposed to blood flowing directly from the carotid artery of a heparinized pig through the perfusion chamber: de-endothelialized pig aorta, collagen strips from rabbit Achilles tendon, and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material (Gore-Tex). Platelets, previously radiolabeled with indium 111 and injected into the animal, were quantified on the material surface, and the total number of deposited platelets determined for a range of blood flow rates (5 to 40 ml/min) and exposure times (0.5 to 20 minutes). The deposition rates were correlated with theory for describing the mass transport of platelets to the test surface. At the wall shear rates investigated (105 to 850 sec-1), the deposition of platelets on subendothelium was strongly dependent on the local flow conditions. Values of deposition on Gore-Tex obtained at similar flow conditions (105 to 425 sec-1) were reduced compared with that observed on subendothelium and showed a markedly weaker dependence on the shear rate. In contrast, deposition of platelets on collagen was more than an order of magnitude greater than on subendothelium and showed a dependence on flow only at the lowest flow rate studied (10 ml/min). The results indicate that collagen is much more reactive than subendothelium and Gore-Tex with respect to the growth and stability of platelet aggregates and moreover suggest that flow mechanisms for depositing platelets on various surface may be substantially different.\r"

The isolation of anti-bovine transferrin IgG fraction was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation of rabbit hyperimmune plasma followed by ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethanol (DEAE) cellulose, at both an acidic and basic pH. The various antibody fractions were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a high-resolution mono-Q column. The specificity and efficiency of the antibody fractions obtained were tested by titration of a constant amount of fetal bovine serum with increasing amounts of antibody. The completeness of removal of the fetal bovine serum transferrin resulting from the formation of the highly stable antibody antigen complex was monitored by immunologic and radioisotope methods. The removal of FBS transferrin by this antibody precipitation technique did not interfere with the ability of added iron 59-tagged human transferrin to deliver iron to rat reticulocytes, as shown in an in vivo incubation model. The method proved to be effective for the fast and complete removal of bovine transferrin from fetal bovine serum in vitro and will be a prerequisite for more detailed studies of the interaction of transferrin of different species with tissue receptors on cell lines in culture without resorting to completely defined culture media.\r"

The competition by transferrin receptors for diferric vs monoferric transferrin was measured in eight normal persons and eight with iron deficiency. There was a highly significant (P less than 0.001) decrease in receptor preference for diferric transferrin in subjects with iron deficiency, indicating an insufficient amount of iron-bearing transferrin to saturate tissue receptors. The adequacy of the plasma iron supply was also examined by determining the number of iron-bearing transferrin molecules with receptors at normal and elevated plasma iron concentrations. Significant increases were found at the higher plasma iron concentration, not only in patients with iron deficiency, but also in patients with sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. Furthermore, the increase in the latter two groups was shown to be proportional to the degree of erythroid hyperplasia. These data indicate that tissue iron supply must be evaluated in terms of both plasma iron supply and erythropoietic requirements and that a relative iron deficiency is frequent in patients with erythroid hyperplasia.\r"

Galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) was tritiated by a modification of the galactose oxidase-sodium borohydride method, and 19 galactosylceramides were synthesized by the direct coupling of galactosylsphingosine with fatty acids of varying lengths (C6 to C24). The highest specific activities of normal prenatal and postnatal enzyme preparations were obtained with the C6 and C8 derivatives, which were six and five times more sensitive, respectively, than the C16 substrate. The residual activities in enzyme preparations from fetuses and children with Krabbe disease were proportionally increased. Our experience indicates that these substrates can provide a sensitive and reliable means for the prenatal and postnatal detection of Krabbe disease.\r"

In murine models inhaled pneumococci are cleared even more rapidly than S. aureus. Conventional opsonins appear to play no role in this clearance, and recently it has been shown that murine alveolar lining material contains free fatty acids and other soluble factors that are directly bactericidal for pneumococci. To determine whether non-phagocytic factors are involved in pneumococcal clearance, we compared the site of killing of inhaled pneumococci and S. aureus in rats using histologic methods and bronchoalveolar lavage. Spontaneous lysis of pneumococci was prevented by use of autolysin-defective pneumococci or by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in the cell wall. Histologic studies showed that the percent of inhaled staphylococci associated with alveolar macrophages always exceeded the percent of staphylococci cleared, whereas there was little association of pneumococci with macrophages during clearance. Analysis of the intracellular or extracellular location of iron 59 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats that had inhaled aerosols of 59Fe-labeled bacteria suggested that staphylococci were killed predominantly in macrophages and pneumococci in the extracellular space. When 59Fe-labeled pneumococci or staphylococci were ingested and killed by macrophages in vitro, the 59Fe remained with the macrophages, suggesting that the extracellular location of 59Fe during pneumococcal killing in vivo was not caused by rapid turnover of 59Fe in macrophages. Studies of the site of killing of inhaled type 25 pneumococci labeled exclusively in the cell wall with carbon 14-ethanolamine confirmed the results obtained with 59Fe-labeled pneumococci. Thus, early killing of inhaled pneumococci, unlike staphylococci, appears to take place outside of macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "To determine how megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-M) of W/Wv mice are affected by the hematopoietic stem cell abnormality, megakaryocytopoiesis was studied in the spleen and marrow of these genetically anemic W/Wv mice. CFU-M were assayed in the soft gel colony-forming system. Megakaryocyte colony size was determined by counting the number of megakaryocytes per colony, and megakaryocyte diameter was determined on acetylcholinesterase-stained cytocentrifuged cell preparations with use of an eyepiece micrometer. In spite of normal blood platelet levels, megakaryocyte level was reduced in the spleen and humerus to about 60% that of +/+ littermates. Megakaryocyte diameters were increased in W/Wv mice. CFU-M in W/Wv mice were reduced to 40% the number seen in the spleen of +/+ mice and to 62% in the humerus. In cell cycle studies, significantly fewer marrow CFU-M were in DNA synthesis in W/Wv mice compared with +/+ animals, but similar numbers of cells were in cycle in the spleen for both genotypes. No difference was observed between W/Wv and +/+ CFU-M in their requirement for exogenous colony-stimulating activity or in the distribution of colony sizes. However, CFU-M-derived colonies cloned from adherent cell-depleted marrow cells were significantly smaller compared with those cultured from unfractionated marrow cells. Results for granulocytes and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) were similar to those obtained for the megakaryocyte series, indicating that the abnormalities are present in different cell lineages. These results suggest that the macromegakaryocytosis of W/Wv mice appears to be a compensation for the megakaryocytopenia. Cells in the progenitor cell compartment appeared not to be involved in this compensation. Furthermore, adherent cells appear to elaborate a factor regulating megakaryocyte development. These findings are compatible with two-level regulation of megakaryocyte formation and a complex mechanism of blood platelet level regulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to identify the carboxypeptidase(s) (CPase) in plasma mediating sequential conversion of the tissue isoform of the MM isoenzyme of creatine kinase (MM3 CK) to MM2 and MM1 isoforms and to elucidate relationships between CPase activity measured in plasma and observed rates of isoform conversion in vitro. Purified MM3 was incubated at 37 degrees C in plasma from normal subjects and patients with acute myocardial infarction. Isoforms were quantified by chromatofocusing. Preincubation with antiserum to CPase N prevented conversion of added MM3 to MM2 and MM1. Isoform conversion rates in the absence of antibody were proportional to plasma CPase N activity assayed spectrophotometrically by hydrolysis of furylacryloyl-L-alanyl-L-lysine substrate (r = 0.89, n = 8). Plasma CPase N activity varied by nearly 300% among individuals, but average activity was similar in samples from normal subjects (267 +/- 45 [SD] U/L, n = 18), those from outpatients with angina (289 +/- 43 U/L, n = 9), and those obtained at hospital admission from patients with acute infarction (Q wave: 279 +/- 70 U/L, n = 16; non-Q wave: 272 +/- 61 U/L, n = 14) or unstable angina (280 +/- 71 U/L, n = 11). In patients with Q wave infarction, CPase N activity increased by 43% +/- 25% between 48 hours and 72 hours (P less than 0.005 compared with admission) with a concomitant change in the rate of conversion of isoforms. Thus, the rate of conversion of isoforms in individual subjects can be estimated by assay of CPase N activity in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The recovery periods of the animals following intratympanic drug applications varied among these studies. The present study compares the cochlear damage caused by intratympanic kanamycin following short (4 days) and long (30 days) post-injection survival periods, using the guinea pig as the animal model. The degree of cochlear damage 4 days after kanamycin injection was consistent among the tested animals. The degeneration was mainly confined to the outer hair cells and almost all inner hair were spared. The change 30 days after kanamycin injection was more variable among the animals and both inner and outer hair cells were damaged. This shows that, although the damage to the cochlea after intratympanic aminoglycoside injection is progressive, a short post-injection recovery period is suitable for comparative intratympanic ototoxicity studies.\r"

The disorders found could be classified as mild bleeding disorders (MBD) and compared to the estimated frequency of MBD in the population there was an increased incidence of haemostatic disorders in the habitual nose-bleeders. Abnormal vessels in the nasal mucosa were present in 85 per cent of the investigated nose-bleeders, equally distributed between nose-bleeders with and without haemostatic disorders.

One half of the children studied scored within the depressed range on the CDI. Thirty-nine percent of the parents scored at least mildly depressed on the BDI. Depression appeared to cluster in families. Every parent who scored in the severe depression range was accompanying a child who rated himself or herself as depressed. All parents who scored above the cutoff for mild depression rated their children as having behavior problems. Children's self-reported depression was also related to negative parental rating of the children's behavior.\r"

Audits were performed before and after physician and patient education on a total of 384 charts. Compliance with all of the screening flow-sheet recommendations improved with education. Significant improvements occurred with the ordering of the tetanus-diphtheria booster and proctosigmoidoscopy examinations. Compliance for most procedures, however, remained well below the recommended level. Unnecessary testing was not decreased by the educational effort. The complete blood count was actually ordered significantly more often after patient education despite the lack of evidence of its value in screening.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of drug with drug, drug with food, and drug with alcohol interactions in a population aged 60 years or greater. Four hundred patients were randomly selected from a university family medicine outpatient clinic population of 4,483 in this age group. A total of 292 drugs were involved for a total of 1,052 potential interactions: 310 drug-food, 316 drug-alcohol, and 426 drug-drug. Interactions were analyzed using The Drug Master computer program and rated as to their clinical significance. Chart review revealed no serious actual interaction for any patient even though potential interactions could be categorized as highly significant for 27 percent of the drug-drug, 11 percent of the drug-alcohol, and 3 percent of the drug-food. Thirty-two percent of the total population were taking five or more drugs concurrently. The mean number of drugs for men was 3.75 and for women 4.22 (P less than .05). Age and race differences were also noted in the number of drugs taken. The most common drugs and their interactions with drug, food, and alcohol are reviewed.\r"

More important, the faculty-associated residents also cared for fewer patients with a variety of chronic diseases and saw them less frequently. These findings suggest that a coexistent faculty practice may have adverse effects on outpatient training in primary care.\r"

Differential diagnosis includes a variety of other infectious diseases and neoplasms. Diagnosis of cat-scratch disease can be made by presence of typical clinical findings, history of exposure to cats, results of skin testing to cat-scratch antigen, and in some circumstances, biopsy or fine-needle aspiration from skin inoculation site or involved lymph nodes.

The 50-g oral glucose screening test was greater than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) in 44 of 181 subjects (24.3 percent) and greater than 8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) in 23 of 181 subjects (12.7 percent). The incidence of gestational diabetes in the study population was 6.1 percent of all pregnancies by standard oral glucose tolerance testing. Incidence of gestational diabetes was 9.5 percent in 21 subjects whose screening test was 7.2 to 8.3 mmol/L (130 to 149 mg/dL) and 39.1 percent in 23 subjects whose screening test was 8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or greater. Using equal to or greater than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) of glucose as the definition of an abnormal screening test yielded a 0.80 specificity and a 0.25 positive predictive value, while the cost for each case of gestational diabetes detected was $114. Using equal to or greater than 8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) of glucose as the definition of an abnormal screening test yielded a 0.81 sensitivity, 0.58 specificity, and 0.39 positive predictive value, while the cost for each case of gestational diabetes detected was $106. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the screening test was more strongly associated with the diagnoses of gestational diabetes than any other risk factor for gestational diabetes. Universal screening of gestational diabetes is recommended in this high-risk population using equal to or greater than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) of glucose as the definition of an abnormal screening test.\r"

To characterize this disorder as it occurs in a university hospital, a sample of 213 patients admitted to adult medical and surgical services was studied. Nineteen of these patients (9 percent) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ed 3, criteria for somatization disorder. A significantly higher proportion of the women compared with the men interviewed had the disorder (14 percent vs 3 percent, P less than .01). Fourteen percent of the divorced, separated, or widowed subjects qualified for the diagnosis, compared with 7 percent of the married subjects and 5 percent of the never-married subjects (P less than .05). Likewise, 32 percent of single patients with children at home had somatization disorder, compared with 4 percent of subjects in all other household configurations (P less than .001). When compared with matched controls, patients with somatization disorder had hospitalizations of roughly equal duration and expense, but had a much higher proportion of negative findings on workup for their presenting complaints (74 percent vs 21 percent, P less than .01). Nevertheless, these patients perceived their health as significantly worse than those without the disorder (P less than .001). None of the patients enrolled in this study had the diagnosis of somatization disorder at admission or discharge. This study documents that patients with somatization disorder are common, are unrecognized, and are admitted to the hospital for nonproductive workups.\r"

Careful history and physical examination in conjunction with selected use of the ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block can confirm the diagnosis of nerve entrapment and preclude an unnecessary workup of these patients. Of the patients with nerve entrapment, most will experience complete relief of symptoms following serial injections and require no further treatment. The remainder will experience only temporary relief and require surgical interruption of the nerve involved. In those patients who obtain no relief from the nerve block, further workup for a source of their pain is warranted. Most of these patients were found to have a subclinical recurrence of an inguinal hernia.\r"

A retrospective study was done in five Washington and Idaho communities to determine the incidence of severe trauma seen in small rural hospitals. Records were reviewed for the year 1983 on all trauma patients (565 cases) who were either admitted to or transferred from these hospitals. The study area included five hospitals and 30 physicians, serving a population of 57,600 people over 7,396 square miles. Each patient's injuries were rated according to the Injury Severity Score (ISS), a standardized trauma index. Of the cases reviewed, 3.4 percent of the cases had an ISS greater than or equal to 20, reflecting severe multisystem trauma, 14.7 percent had an ISS of 10 to 19, ie, severe trauma limited to one body system or multisystem trauma of a less-critical nature. There were 30 patients (5.3 percent) with critical head injuries, 24 patients (4.2 percent) with major chest injuries, and 21 patients (3.7 percent) with serious abdominal injuries. The results showed that each individual physician or hospital did not see the severe cases often, but that when they occurred, these types of injuries necessitated an experienced, rapid response on the part of the hospital staff. This finding has significant implications for trauma management in rural communities.\r"

Results of a factor analysis, which used questionnaire data from all of the 1137 subjects so that direct group comparisons could be made, indicated the presence of 10 major dimensions of attitude and expectation. Results also suggested considerable variation, particularly by status (client vs. staff) and ethnic group, on these dimensions. An additional analysis of staff attitudes and expectations revealed correlations with years of education, ex-addict status, and years of work experience. Such findings suggest the need to consider client/staff characteristics and attitudes in the planning of treatment services for narcotic addicts. An abbreviated (53-item) attitude and expectation questionnaire was developed for this purpose.\r"

In this study, the Oriental flushing reaction that was produced with ingestion of small amounts of alcohol was antagonized by antihistamine administration. A group of 17 subjects was tested. Each subject received placebo, diphenhydramine 50 mg (H-1 receptor antagonist), and cimetidine 300 mg (H-2 receptor antagonist) singularly and in combination. Alcohol was then administered orally. Most subjects given placebo experienced the typical flushing reaction that included a cutaneous flush, increase in skin temperature, decrease in blood pressure, increase in pulse rate and subjective symptoms such as dizziness, sleepiness, anxiety, headache, generalized weakness, and nausea. The flush, temperature and systolic hypotension were significantly blocked by the combined antihistamine administration. Cimetidine given alone blocked the flush, temperature increase, and systolic hypotension significantly more than diphenhydramine but less than the combined antihistamines. Diphenhydramine was similar to placebo in its effect on the flushing reaction. The role of histamine in the expression of tolerance to alcohol is not known. Antihistamine antagonism of the adverse flushing reaction suggests that histamine receptors may participate in the intolerance to ethanol in Orientals. Histamine may be an important protective factor in the low prevalence of alcoholism in Orientals.\r"

Excessive death from natural causes was found in women with secondary unipolar depression and bipolar depression and in manics (men and women combined) who had concurrent organic mental disorders or serious medical illnesses. Natural death was not excessive in the absence of these conditions. We conclude that excessive natural death reported in psychiatric patients is due to complicating physical disorders and not to the primary psychiatric disorder per se, whereas excessive unnatural death is due to the psychiatric disorder. Also, psychiatrically ill persons are probably referred for hospitalization more frequently when complicating physical disorders are present. Finally, we conclude that mortality patterns were similar in patients with primary and secondary unipolar depression, but bipolar patients were at lower risk for unnatural death than were unipolar patients.\r"

Clinical experience suggests that existing categories do not adequately provide for commonly seen forms of factitious illness. It is now recognized that factitious disorder is the result of a complex interaction of personality factors and psychosocial stressors that often present with both medical and psychiatric symptomatology. Proposed changes in the revised edition of the diagnostic manual DSM-III-R include separate categories of factitious disorder with psychological, physical, and both psychological and physical symptoms. A case report of a patient for whom extensive records and thorough psychological assessment were available is exemplary of a more common course of the disorder (both psychological and physical symptoms) that by current classification would be considered \"atypical.\" A reconceptualization of the disorder that gives emphasis to course and clinical features is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "This paper discusses contrasting assumptions in psychiatric epidemiological research regarding the relative significance of childhood and adult social experiences as etiological factors in adult psychopathology. It delineates a set of hypotheses that relate internal parental representations to subsequent depressed mood and to psychosocial assets assumed to mediate the relationships between parental representations and mood states. These hypotheses were prospectively tested using a cohort of medical students surveyed at medical school entrance and 7 months later. The data show that earlier paternal affectivity perceived at time 1 is inversely predictive of time 2 depressed mood, holding time 1 mood constant, whereas earlier maternal and paternal overprotection perceived at time 1 are directly predictive of time 2 depressed mood, holding time 1 mood constant. In addition, parental representations at time 1 are significantly linked to particular personality characteristics at time 1 and 2. However, it is not clear whether these personality characteristics are antecedents or consequences of depressed mood. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and methodological issues involved in the retrospective assessment of remote social experiences as etiological factors in adult psychopathology.\r"

This response is identical to that which followed the publication of the first cases of child abuse in the 1960s. The present paper attempts a preliminary exploration of the incidence of the urge to \"hurt or punish\" the unborn child using a sample of 112 normal pregnant women and their male partners. Eight percent of the women and 4% of the men acknowledged experiencing such an urge. The male partner appeared to be aware of the woman's aggressive feelings toward the fetus and the male's reports tend to validate the female findings. Despite some methodological shortcomings, the findings suggest that the urge to physically assault the fetus is not rare. The need for further investigation of the phenomenon is highlighted, as it may well represent the earliest precursor of later physical child abuse.\r"

The most common primary diagnoses for the sample included separation anxiety disorder (33%), overanxious disorder (15%), social phobia of school (15%), and major depression (15%). Children with a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorders were most likely to receive a concurrent diagnosis of overanxious disorder. Alternatively, children with a primary diagnosis of overanxious disorder were most likely to receive an additional diagnosis indicative of a social anxiety problem, either social phobia or avoidant disorder. Children with a primary major depression most often exhibited social phobia and/or overanxious disorder. No clear-cut pattern of comorbidity emerged for the social phobic (school) group. These findings are discussed in terms of their comparability with results recently obtained from an adult anxiety clinic population.\r"

Adult attachment is defined in terms of eight features: proximity seeking, secure base effect, separation protest, feared loss of the attachment figure, reciprocity, availability, responsiveness of the attachment figure, and use of the attachment figure. Each feature was defined and a large item pool to tap all dimensions was derived from item nominations by clinicians, researchers, and lay subjects. The resultant scales were administered to a small sample for preliminary empirical testing. Analyses of internal reliability for each scale resulted in the elimination of items that detracted from reliability. After editing, all scales had satisfactory internal consistency. A discriminant-functions analysis provided suggestive evidence that this method of defining and measuring adult attachment would have relevance for identifying psychopathology.\r"

The evidence is based on anterolateral cordotomies. The fibres lie within the medial part of the equatorial plane, extending from the base of the posterior horn and the lateral horn across the medial half of the white matter. The evidence from a previous paper together with that of the present paper is that the pathway maintains this position throughout the spinal cord as far as the L2 segment. The sympathomotor fibres caudal to the head and neck are supplied from both sides of the cord: sympathetic activity is not removed, although it may be slightly diminished, by a hemisection of the cord. The evidence suggests that sympathetic fibres for vasomotor control leave the cord cranial to the Th 7 segment. The knowledge of the location of the pathways is of value to neurosurgeons so that they may be avoided in the operation of anterolateral cordotomy.\r"

While cognitive-behavioural slowing may be observed in both depressive illness and subcortical neurological disorders, a normal rate of processing information centrally appears to distinguish depression from certain of these disorders. Psychomotor slowing in the presence of normal information processing speed might be explained by a deficit in motivational state associated with depression.\r"

In this task, one \"postural\" forearm, held in a horizontal position while supporting a 1 kg weight, was unloaded either by the experimenter's hand (imposed unloading) or by the subject's other hand in response to a tone burst (voluntary unloading). The variables recorded were reaction time (RT: time interval between the tone and beginning of unloading) and movement time (MT: duration of the change in force measured by a force platform on the \"postural\" forearm). Elbow angle changes were also measured with a potentiometer. The EMG activity from brachioradialis of the \"postural\" arm and that from the biceps of the \"active\" arm were recorded. The Parkinsonian patients showed an increase in both RT and MT and an impairment of the co-ordination between movement and posture which was reflected in an increase in amplitude of the elbow rotation after voluntary unloading. Moreover, the decrease in EMG activity in the brachioradialis of the postural arm during unloading was less in Parkinsonian patients than in the normal group. This disorder of postural command was often accompanied by a lack of anticipatory EMG changes. Comparison between treated and non-treated patients showed that dopamine agonists brought about recovery of both RT and MT but did not improve postural co-ordination. The co-ordination was less impaired when the voluntary unloading was performed by the preferred hand. Several hypotheses are discussed concerning the mechanism underlying this impaired co-ordination.\r"

With magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, however, lesions could be demonstrated in patients undergoing a psychosurgical procedure, gamma capsulotomy, for anxiety disorder. The appearance and location of the lesions were related to the irradiation dose and to the long-term clinical outcome studied prospectively by two independent evaluators who had not been involved in the selection or the treatment of the patients. Seven consecutive cases were examined. CT was also included for comparison reasons. Lesions were clearly visible with MR in patients who improved after surgery. Conversely, lesions were inadequate in cases who did not benefit. MR proved to be more accurate than CT both in detecting the lesions and in defining their configuration. The observations argue for the use of MR for post-operative verification of radiosurgical lesions. MR may facilitate the determination of a clinically effective radiation threshold estimate for radiosurgical lesions, which should be of value for the planning of studies of this type of limbic system surgery.\r"

In comparison with a control group (n = 20), there was (1) a marked reduction of blood flow in the temporal region corresponding to the site of the epileptic focus and (2) a reduction in blood flow in distant brain areas and the contralateral hemisphere. The rCBF decrease was highly correlated (p less than 0.001) with the disease severity (taking into account the complex partial seizure frequency and the number of secondary generalised seizures). Differences were found in the rCBF decrease between left and right temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

All but one had an abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potential with 72% showing a delay in the II-V and I-V interpeak latencies of more than three standard deviations.

All subjects had normal trigeminal reflexes and evoked potentials. Sensory action potentials were recorded antidromically from the supraorbital (V1), infraorbital (V2) and mental (V3) nerves. In the awake subject, sensory potentials were usually followed by myogenic artifacts due to direct activation of masticatory muscles or reflex activation of facial muscles. In the anaesthetised and curarised subject, sensory potentials from the three nerves showed 1.4-2.2 ms onset latency, 1.9-2.7 ms peak latency and 17-29 microV amplitude. Sensory conduction velocity was computed at the onset latency (maximum CV) and at the peak latency (peak CV). On average, maximum and peak CV were 52 and 39 m/s for V1, 54 and 42 m/s for V2 and 54 and 44 m/s for V3. There was no apparent difference in CV between subjects with trigeminal neuralgia and those with epilepsy. A significant inverse correlation was found between CV and age, the overall maximum CV declining from 59 m/s (16 years) to 49 m/s (73 years). This range of CV is compatible both with histometric data and previous electrophysiological findings on trigeminal nerve conduction. Intraoperative intracranial stimulation is also proposed as a method of monitoring trigeminal function under general anaesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous measurements of aortic and radial artery pressures are reviewed, and a model of the cardiovascular system is presented. The model is based on resonant networks for the aorta and axillo-brachial-radial arterial system. The model chosen is a simple one, in order to make interpretation of the observed relationships clear. Despite its simplicity, the model produces realistic aortic and radial artery pressure waveforms. It demonstrates that the resonant properties of the arterial wall significantly alter the pressure waveform as it is propagated from the aorta to the radial artery. Although the mean and end-diastolic radial pressures are usually accurate estimates of the corresponding aortic pressures, the systolic pressure at the radial artery is often much higher than that of the aorta due to overshoot caused by the resonant behavior of the radial artery. The radial artery dicrotic notch is predominantly dependent on the axillo-brachial-radial arterial wall properties, rather than on the aortic valve or peripheral resistance. Hence the use of the radial artery dicrotic notch as an estimate of end systole is unreliable. The rate of systolic upstroke, dP/dt, of the radial artery waveform is a function of many factors, making it difficult to interpret. The radial artery waveform usually provides accurate estimates for mean and diastolic aortic pressures; for all other measurements it is an inadequate substitute for the aortic pressure waveform. In the presence of low forearm peripheral resistance the mean radial artery pressure may significantly underestimate the mean aortic pressure, as explained by a voltage divider model.\r"

Eleven (10%) experienced moderate desaturation (arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%), and 5 (5%) suffered severe hypoxemic episodes (arterial oxygen saturation less than 85%). Among patient risk factors--including operation, body habitus, smoking habits, history of asthma, age, and airway characteristics--an association with moderate hypoxemia was found only with nonlaparoscopic gynecologic operation, obesity, and age over 35 years, and an association with severe hypoxemia was found only with obesity and age over 35. Among operative events--including inspired oxygen concentration, position, mode of ventilation, and anesthesia phase--an association with moderate hypoxemia was found only with the lithotomy position, manual ventilation, and arousal. The cost per patient of monitoring with a pulse oximeter is about +1.35. A cost-benefit analysis reveals that a mortality rate of 1 in 40,000 among patients who actually become moderately hypoxemic would justify the cost of monitoring arterial oxygen saturation. We conclude that pulse oximetry should be part of routine anesthetic monitoring.\r"

The light absorbance (optical density) in plasma (range 500 to 800 nm) was measured by a spectrophotometer. Fluorescein did not affect oximetry measurements, plasma light absorbance in the range measured, or hemodynamic variables. Methylene blue caused dose-dependent decreases in measurements made with both forms of oximetry for up to 30 minutes, the decrease being greater and longer lasting with pulse oximetry (P less than 0.05). Hemodynamic measurements in 5 dogs showed that methylene blue (1 to 5 mg/kg) increased arterial pressure transiently, after which cardiac output, stroke index, and left ventricular stroke work index decreased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances increased (P less than 0.05 with 5 mg/kg). Methemoglobin concentration measured by co-oximetry increased significantly (to 19.9 +/- 1.4%, P less than 0.05) 1 minute after 5 mg/kg of methylene blue was injected. Methylene blue had a dose- and time-dependent effect on plasma light absorbance, and this effect peaked in the 660- to 670-nm range. The data do not distinguish the relative contributions of physiology (hemodynamic change), chemistry (methemoglobin production), and physics (optical properties) to the decrease in pulse oximetry and co-oximetry measurements that follows injection of methylene blue. Indocyanine green affected neither hemodynamic variables nor co-oximetry readings but decreased pulse oximetry readings for up to 10 minutes dose dependently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements made in vivo with the pulse oximeters, with detectors placed on the tongue, were compared with measurements made in vitro using an IL 282 CO-Oximeter as SaO2 decreased toward zero. Measurements from the two oximeters correlated poorly over the range from 0 to 100% SaO2 (r = 0.69). In this range, the correlation between Nellcor N-100 measurements and those of the CO-Oximeter had an r of 0.82, a regression line slope of 0.82, and a y intercept of 14.8; the correlation between the Ohmeda Biox 3700 and the CO-Oximeter had an r of 0.83, a regression line slope of 0.66, and a y intercept of 32.7. The correlation with the CO-Oximeter was similar for both the Ohmeda and the Nellcor pulse oximeters at an SaO2 of 80% or more. However, when SaO2 was less than 80%, measurements by pulse oximetry correlated less well with CO-Oximeter measurements (r = 0.62, slope = 0.64, and y intercept = 21.0 for Nellcor; r = 0.71, slope = 0.67, and y intercept = 32.4 for Ohmeda). When SaO2 was less than 60%, both oximeters inaccurately indicated the co-oximetry values (r = 0.36 and y intercept = 26.1 for the Nellcor; r = 0.48 and y intercept = 33.2 for the Ohmeda).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulse oximeters providing a continuous display of the pulse waveform offer a new method of estimating relative volume status during positive-pressure ventilation.

Pulse oximeter waveform tracings were compared with central venous pressure and intraarterial pressure tracings in 12 patients undergoing major operative procedures. A significant correlation (r = 0.61) was seen between pulse waveform variation and systolic pressure variation, which has previously been shown to be a sensitive indicator of hypovolemia. When data from individual patients were analyzed separately, the correlation between pulse waveform variation and systolic pressure variation was as high as 0.88.\r"

The objective of this study was to compare manual administration with computer-controlled administration. Anesthesia was induced in 22 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status I and II) with fentanyl and sodium thiopental and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Neuromuscular function was assessed at the hypothenar eminence and the adductor pollicis (train-of-four stimulation). A bolus of 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium was given to obtain 100% twitch depression for tracheal intubation. After twitch height returned to 25% of control, relaxation was maintained by traditional bolus injections (group 1, n = 7), manually controlled continuous infusion (group 2, n = 7), or computer-controlled continuous infusion (group 3, n = 8). In all three groups the desired level of relaxation was 90% twitch depression. Variability of relaxation differed significantly among the three groups (group 1: 10.5%, group 2: 12.4%, group 3: 7.1%). Twitch height was more constant with computer control than with either bolus injections or manual infusion (P less than 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the drug requirement (group 1: 1.60 microgram/kg/min, group 2: 1.51 microgram/kg/min, group 3: 1.45 microgram/kg/min). Variability in the mechanomyogram (n = 12) was much higher than in the electromyogram (n = 10). Computer-controlled infusion may be a useful adjunct for the anesthesiologist who desires a stable level of patient relaxation when using short-acting, non-depolarizing relaxants.\r"

Both patients were monitored with intraoperative posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). In each case, the surgical procedure was nearly complete when an abrupt and persistent loss of SSEPs occurred. Although minor recovery of waveforms was present by the end of the operation, the SSEP waveforms remained strikingly abnormal. Neither patient had a postoperative motor deficit, although both had evidence of dorsal column dysfunction. These observations suggest that, during dorsal column surgery, even dramatic SSEP loss may not be associated with motor pathway injury, but rather, may correlate better with postoperative dorsal column dysfunction. The possible implications for intraoperative monitoring of SSEPs during dorsal column surgical procedures are discussed.\r"

The size of the artery is measured when its internal pressure (arterial pressure) equals the external pressure.

The external pressure then constantly equals internal pressure (arterial blood pressure) and is reported by the monitor as values for systolic, mean, and diastolic pressure. A finger cuff with a built-in light source and detector is used to measure finger artery size, and an inflatable bladder is used to apply the external pressure to the artery. The monitor is microprocessor based; algorithms determine the unloaded artery size approximately every minute and automatically correct for changes possibly induced by smooth muscle contraction or relaxation, and a high-speed electropneumatic servo control system enables automatic calibration and adjustment.\r"

Five courses of chemotherapy were planned. Afterwards or on progression, patients were randomized to receive maximally tolerated radiation to all sites of disease v observation only. Forty males and seven females were entered. Median age was 60 years (range, 37 to 74), median Karnofsky performance status was 70 (range, 30 to 90). Five patients had previous brain radiation therapy for metastatic disease, all others were previously untreated. Side effects in the 87 courses of chemotherapy administered included leukopenia (WBC less than 1,000/microL following nine courses) and thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 20,000/microL following four courses). Ten patients became septic, nine of them while leukopenic. Elevations of serum creatinine followed eight courses; in all cases the level was less than 3.0 mg/dL. Nausea and vomiting were mild to moderate. Five patients experienced mild hypoacusis and six had sensory polyneuropathy. The deaths of three patients were considered drug-related. The response rate was 28%. The median survival for the group was 22 weeks, 63.2 weeks for responders and 17.9 weeks for nonresponders. Twenty-six patients received radiation therapy, 16 randomized to this arm as planned, ten to palliate symptoms. Median survival of all irradiated patients was 24.8 weeks. Seven responders to chemotherapy were randomized to receive radiotherapy; their median survival was 25 weeks. In six responders randomized not to receive radiation, the median survival was 77.8 weeks (P greater than .3). Among nonresponding patients, the median survival of those radiated was 22.2 weeks, while that of nonradiated patients was 11 weeks. This regimen is cumbersome and toxic. It has offered no major survival benefits, or improvement in response rates, therefore, we do not recommend it for the standard treatment of NSCLC.\r"

All patients underwent complete neuroradiological evaluation by computed tomography (CT) and myelography. Prior to operation, brachial plexopathy was noted in 20 patients (67%), and invasion of the spine in eight (27%). Using a team approach, gross total resection of tumor was achieved in 17 of 26 patients (65%) undergoing thoracotomy. There was no operative mortality. The use of a team approach allows extended surgical resection, especially when the spine is involved. In patients presenting with brachial plexopathy or cord compression, de novo surgery before radiation may provide better long-term palliation and pain relief.\r"

All patients had been heavily pretreated with conventional modes of therapy (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, surgical resection). Twenty-two courses yielded a partial response; two courses yielded a complete response; four courses showed no response; one patient was treated as an adjunct to surgery; and one patient was lost to follow-up. Duration to response was variable, ranging from 6 weeks to 8 months. Several women had chest wall disease controlled for prolonged periods of time using repeated courses of PDT. Two women had re-epithelialization of ulcerated lesions. Complications were minimal and included pain (two patients), sunburn (two), and infection (one). These results suggest that treatment with PDT can aid in local control of chest wall recurrence following mastectomy in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "We devised a method of detecting estrogen receptors (ER) in bone marrow metastases from patients with breast cancer. The method involves a sequential double-staining immunocytochemical technique, with a monoclonal antibody to ER and a polyclonal antibody recognizing epithelial membrane antigen to confirm the epithelial nature of suspected tumor cells. Twenty-seven patients were assessed: ten were found to have ER-positive tumor cells in the bone marrow; ten had ER-negative cells; and the remaining seven patients had no tumor cells in the bone marrow smears. Of the ten patients with ER-positive cells, eight (80%) either had a response to endocrine therapy, implying that they possess ER-positive breast cancers, or had ER-positive primary tumors as determined by the dextran-coated charcoal biochemical assay (DCC). Of the ten patients with ER-negative cells in the bone marrow, eight failed to respond to endocrine therapy. This technique therefore provides a means of predicting which patients will respond to endocrine therapy, and is particularly important in those patients whose ER status is unknown.\r"

  ".U": "88061486\r", 
  ".W": "Cisplatin has proven to be the most active single agent in the treatment of metastatic and recurrent squamous cell cancer of the cervix. In a previous southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) pilot study, the addition of cisplatin to a mitomycin-C, vincristine, and bleomycin (MVB) regimen resulted in a relatively high percentage of durable complete responses. To gain more experience with cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, the SWOG initiated a phase II randomized trial of cisplatin, mitomycin-C plus cisplatin (MC), and MVB plus cisplatin (MVBC) in 119 patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the cervix and no prior chemotherapy exposure. Because of slow patient accrual early in the trial, the cisplatin arm was discontinued. Five patients were declared ineligible according to protocol criteria. The three treatment groups were relatively well matched for age, prior radiation exposure, and sites of measurable disease. The overall objective response rates for cisplatin, MC, and MVBC treated patients were 33%, 25%, and 22%, respectively. Median response durations were greater than 6 months. Median survival durations associated with cisplatin, MC, and MVBC treatment were 17.0, 7.0, and 6.9 months, respectively. There were no drug-related deaths. Severe or life-threatening leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 18% to 24% of patients treated with MVBC and MC, but in none of those receiving cisplatin alone. We conclude that the low response rates and short durations of both response and survival observed in patients randomized to the two chemotherapy combinations suggest that only enhanced toxicity was gained through the addition of mitomycin-C or MVB to cisplatin in patients with advanced cervix cancer.\r"

Patients were treated with HN2 in an aqueous or ointment base with equal efficacy. Response rates depended on the extent of skin involvement. In limited plaque (T1) disease, complete and overall response rates were 51% and 88%, respectively, while in generalized plaque (T2) disease they were 26% and 69%. No patients with tumorous involvement (T3) achieved complete skin clearance and all 13 of these patients developed progression of disease. Only two of nine patients with erythrodema (T4) achieved a complete response (CR), and both later relapsed. After achieving a CR, 40% of patients with T1 disease and 60% with T2 disease later relapsed; however, subsequent therapies, including repeat courses of topical HN2, often were successful in achieving later skin clearance. Overall, 42% of T1 patients and 31% of T2 patients were without evidence of MF at last follow-up. When death occurred, it was usually unrelated to MF in the T1 group. However, half of the deaths of patients with T2 disease were attributable to MF. Among the 22 patients with T3 or T4 disease, 80% of deaths were attributable to MF. The most common complication observed was a cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction, which occurred much more commonly with the aqueous than the ointment preparation. Fourteen patients (11%) developed subsequent cutaneous malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Anatomic dye injection studies of the blood supply of colorectal hepatic metastases suggest that tumors are supplied predominantly by the hepatic artery. Using 13N amino acids with dynamic gamma camera imaging in patients with colorectal hepatic metastases, it has been shown that hepatic artery infusion results in a significantly greater nutrient delivery to tumor compared with portal vein infusion. However, direct measurements of drug levels in tumor following hepatic artery and portal vein infusion in humans have not previously been reported. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer confined to the liver received fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) through the hepatic artery or through the portal vein. All patients had previously failed systemic chemotherapy. Five patients with hepatic artery catheters were matched (by age, serum lactic dehydrogenase levels, percent hepatic replacement, and tumor size) with five patients with portal vein catheters. At operation, 3H-FUdR (1 microCi/kg) and 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) (6 mCi) were injected into the hepatic artery or portal vein. Liver and tumor biopsies were obtained two and five minutes later. 3H and 99mTc were measured per gram tissue by scintillation and gamma counting. The mean liver levels following hepatic artery infusion (23.9 +/- 11.4 nmol/g) and portal vein infusion (18.4 +/- 14.5 nmol/g) did not differ. However, the mean tumor FUdR level following hepatic artery infusion was 12.4 +/- 12.2 nmol/g, compared with a mean tumor FUdR level following portal vein infusion of 0.8 +/- 0.7 nmol/g (P less than .01). This low level of tumor drug uptake after portal vein infusion of FUdR predicts minimal tumor response to treatment via this route. Thus, regional chemotherapy for established colorectal hepatic metastases should be administered through the hepatic artery.\r"

However, the frequency of these adverse effects in both short- and long-term survivors may be underestimated. Sixty-five patients treated in the University of Rochester Cancer Center since 1968 with radiation with or without BCNU chemotherapy for CNS tumors not involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis were evaluated for thyroid, prolactin, and gonadal disturbances regardless of clinical symptomatology. Prolactin values were elevated in 19 of 47 patients (40%). For males and females treated with greater than 55 Gy, abnormal values were present in nine of 11 (82%) and seven of 14 (50%), respectively. For males and females treated with less than or equal to 55 Gy, two of nine (22%) and one of 13 (8%), respectively, were abnormal (P = .0001). Six of six patients who also received BCNU chemotherapy were hyperprolactinemic, as compared with six of ten (60%) who did not receive BCNU. Seven of eight females with elevated prolactin levels had menstruation abnormalities, and five of seven adult males noted a decrease in libido. Mild abnormalities in testosterone concentration were found in three of nine men evaluated, all of whom had normal gonadotropins. Of 47 patients who did not receive irradiation to the spinal axis (and thus the thyroid gland), ten (21%) had a decreased thyroxin (T4) value. Only one of these patients had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) value. Of 32 patients who received greater than 55 Gy, ten (31%) had a low T4, compared with zero of 15 who received less than or equal to 55 Gy (P = .0001). Four of eight patients (50%) who also received BCNU had low T4 values, as compared with three of 14 (21%) who did not receive BCNU. Of 15 patients who were treated with 4 to 10 MV photon irradiation to the spinal axis, five patients (33%) had elevated TSH values. The mean spinal axis dose in these patients was 33 Gy. Two euthyroid children in this group manifested the early onset of puberty. The complex of endocrinologic abnormalities observed in several patients receiving only cranial irradiation, that is elevated prolactin, decreased thyroid, and gonadal hormone secretion in the presence of otherwise normal pituitary hormone levels, suggests a radiation-induced insult to the hypothalamic regulation of pituitary function.\r"

Acute side effects were mild abdominal pain, pyrexia, diarrhea, and moderate reversible pancytopenia. One patient developed a subphrenic abscess requiring surgical drainage. Eight patients with large volume disease, ie, greater than 2 cm tumor diameter, did not respond to antibody-guided irradiation and died of progressive disease within 9 months of treatment. Sixteen patients had small-volume (less than 2 cm) disease at the time of treatment with radiolabeled antibody. Seven patients failed to respond, and of nine initial responders, four patients remain alive and free from disease 6 months to 3 years from treatment. Analysis of the data on relapse indicated that doses greater than 140 mCi were more effective than lower doses. We conclude that the intraperitoneal administration of 140 mCi or more of 131I-labeled tumor-associated monoclonal antibodies represents a new and potentially effective form of therapy for patients with small-volume stage III ovarian cancer.\r"

Clinical correlations based on the ATCCS were obtained in 65 patients undergoing 71 clinical trials. Patients with melanoma, lung cancer, and sarcoma dominated the group.

The assay in this study had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 93%. These preliminary results are encouraging and warrant prospective trials to establish the true value of this assay to patients.\r"

We have found that normal human kidney, six of eight adenocarcinomas of the kidney, and four cell lines derived from kidney adenocarcinomas express high levels of mdr1 mRNA. Two criteria suggest that primary multidrug resistance in human adenocarcinomas of the kidney results, at least in part, from expression of the mdr1 gene: (1) mdr1 mRNA levels are elevated in four unselected kidney adenocarcinoma cell lines that show a multidrug-resistant phenotype; and (2) multidrug resistance in these kidney cancer cell lines is reversed by verapamil and quinidine, agents known to reverse mdr1-associated drug resistance in cell lines selected for multidrug resistance in vitro. These results suggest that appropriate pharmacological intervention to reverse multidrug resistance might make adenocarcinomas of the kidney more sensitive to chemotherapy with agents such as Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) and the vinca alkaloids.\r"

The study design involved two treatments per week for 4 weeks with alternating subcutaneous and intravenous (IV) administration, and weekly dose escalation through four levels in each patient. The dose range was 1 to 200 micrograms/m2 for IV bolus injection, and 5 to 250 micrograms/m2 for subcutaneous injection. Thirteen patients completed the full course. Early discontinuation of treatment was related to rTNF toxicity in seven cases. The major side effects were rigors, fever, headache, fatigue, and hypotension. Acute changes in granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, changes in serum zinc levels and plasma cortisol levels consistent with an acute phase response, and inflammation at the site of subcutaneous injection were also seen. At doses of 125 to 250 micrograms/m2, inflammation at the subcutaneous injection site was unacceptably severe. Minor changes were seen in hemostatic parameters. Hypotension was corrected by fluid administration and did not require treatment with vasopressors. Initial serum concentrations of rTNF were measured at five minutes after IV administration and were found to range from 2.5 ng/mL after a dose of 35 micrograms/m2 to 80 ng/mL after a dose of 200 micrograms/m2. The half-life of rTNF in the blood was 20 minutes. A decrease in lymph node size was observed in a patient with B cell lymphoma.\r"

Thirty-five successive unselected patients entered the study over 1 year and were treated by alternating sequences of cisplatin/VM-26 (PE) and vincristine/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin (CADO). Three courses of each sequence were delivered. Disease reevaluation was extensive, with special focus on bone marrow status. Using strict criteria, 24 patients (68%) achieved a good partial response (GPR), which comprised normalization of bone marrow, and ten (28%) achieved a partial response (PR), and one progressed. The overall response rate was 96%. Thirty-two patients underwent surgery, and complete macroscopic removal of the primary was achieved in 21 (65%). After completion of induction and surgery, six patients (17%) were in complete remission (CRm), without evidence of any residual disease; nine (26%) were in very good partial remission (VGPRm; same as CRm except persistence of nonpathologically evaluable improved bone scan), and 19 (51%) were in partial remission (PRm). Toxicity was acceptable, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. These results show no substantial improvement compared with those previously reported with similar but nonalternating regimens. We advocate a two-category concept (response, remission) to describe initial therapy results in metastatic neuroblastoma and emphasize the need to assess bone marrow by an extensive evaluation.\r"

Current income, highest income, occupation, type of dwelling, years of education, and crowding did not enter the stepwise regression model at alpha = .10. In contrast, many clinical factors predicted prognosis (calcium, P = .019; percent plasma cells on initial bone marrow, P = .019; history of transfusions, P = .015; WBC count, P = .007; pathologic fractures, P = .001; and urate, P less than .001). Thus, we do not confirm the previously reported association between social class and myeloma survival.\r"

  ".W": "During a 2-year period, 15 of 110 patients (14%) admitted for intensive therapy of acute leukemia associated with prolonged deep granulocytopenia developed documented invasive aspergillosis (IA). Antemortem diagnosis was accomplished in 14, and 13 of 15 (87%) survived the infection. Because of the high success rate, we reviewed the courses of the 15 patients to assess factors associated with this favorable outcome. Eleven presented with pulmonary IA; early symptoms occurred at a mean 21.6 days of granulocytopenia (less than 100/muL) and included refractory fever in 14 and pulmonary signs or symptoms in 11. Primary necrotic chest wall lesions associated with Hickman catheters developed in four at a mean 11 days of granulocytopenia, followed by pulmonary involvement. All 15 patients had chest radiographs during granulocytopenia, with 14 (93%) demonstrating pulmonary infiltrates and/or nodules at a mean 20.6 days of aplasia. Nine patients had lung computerized tomography (CT) scans, revealing nodular infiltrates in one patient and a characteristic zone of low attenuation surrounding a mass-like infiltrate in seven other patients, which was found to be diagnostic of IA. Subsequent CT scans performed during and following bone marrow recovery showed progression to cavitation followed by either complete resolution or minimal pulmonary scarring. Eleven patients developed IA during empiric amphotericin B (Amp-B) therapy (0.5 mg/kg/d) for fever refractory to antibacterial antibiotics. Fourteen patients received high-dose Amp-B (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/d), which was started within a mean of 2.2 days of first clinical findings; 13 survived. Ten patients received 5-fluorocytosine in addition to high dose amp-B. Survival was similar regardless of presentation, as 91% with primary pulmonary IA and 75% presenting with chest wall lesions survived. All 13 surviving patients had complete granulocyte recovery at a mean 33.8 days. Nephrotoxicity (creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL) was observed in seven patients during therapy for IA, but was transient in all seven. We conclude IA can be successfully treated in the deeply granulocytopenic patient provided that it is recognized and treated early, and provided that antifungal therapy is aggressive and is continued until granulocyte recovery occurs.\r"

These patients were observed for a mean period of 18 months. There were 23 males and 17 females with a median age of 64 years. Nine patients had lung carcinoma, 8 colon carcinoma, 7 lymphoma, 5 breast carcinoma, 5 head and neck carcinoma, 2 acute leukemia, 2 prostate carcinoma, 1 adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, and 1 sarcoma. Eight patients had liver metastases. PRC was measured by ELISA, AT-III by radial immunodiffusion, and FPA by RIA. Four patients had decreased AT-III, 28 had decreased levels of PRC, and 39 had elevated levels of FPA. All patients with liver metastases had low PRC. Albumin levels were lower in patients with low PRC (mean 3.3 g/dL v 4.0 g/dL for others). Eight patients, five with liver metastases, developed thrombotic (4), hemorrhagic (3), or both (1) complications. Statistically significant associations were found between (1) presence of liver metastases and development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications (P less than .001), (2) presence of liver metastases and decreased PRC (P = .001), and (3) lower albumin levels and decreased PRC (P = .0001). Our study documents early changes of hemostasis in untreated malignancy. We extend previous observations that decreased PRC levels in malignancy may be due to poor synthetic functions of liver. Presence of liver metastases was the only factor associated with subsequent development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. Biochemical markers of hemostatic abnormalities, even though encountered frequently at the time of presentation, are of little predictive value for development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications.\r"

This allows pathological restaging of the disease at each examination. For example, this type of follow-up is common in clinical trials evaluating intravesical therapies. In such trials, clinical outcome is typically summarized using end-points that measure failure to control superficial disease. Alternative endpoints measuring failure to prevent progression to invasive disease are often ignored. In this report, the rationale for ignoring the invasive disease endpoints is given and flaws in the rationale are described. Evidence from actual data sets support the view that superficial disease endpoints may not be appropriate surrogates for invasive disease endpoints. It is recommended that time to invasive disease should be considered a major endpoint when designing and analyzing trials in superficial bladder cancer.\r"

Bleomycin (60 mg/m2) was mixed in 2 L of 0.9% NaCl, and administered rapidly into the peritoneal cavity via a Port-a-Cath (Pharmacia Nu Tech, Inc, Walpole, MA). The cavity was drained following either a four- or eight-hour dwell time. Bleomycin concentration in the peritoneal cavity and plasma was determined by radioimmunoassay. A total of 15 courses was studied. The peak peritoneal: plasma concentration ratio averaged 22, and total exposure for the peritoneal cavity averaged seven-fold greater than that for the plasma. The peritoneal and plasma half-lives for bleomycin were 3.2 and 6.0 hours, respectively. The peritoneal clearance of bleomycin averaged 11.3 mL/min/m2. Abdominal pain occurred on 47% of courses; other toxicities included fever, skin rash, and mucositis. We conclude that there is a substantial pharmacologic advantage to the peritoneal route for tumors confined to the peritoneum, but that the advantage is less, and the local toxicity greater, than that found with the intraperitoneal administration of many other anticancer drugs.\r"

  ".U": "88061596\r", 
  ".W": "The medical records and arteriograms of 81 patients with spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) were reviewed, and the vascular lesions were classified as dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas or intradural AVM's. Intradural AVM's were further classified as intramedullary AVM's (juvenile and glomus types) and direct AV fistulas, which were extramedullary or intramedullary in location. Dural AV fistulas were defined as being supplied by a dural artery and draining into spinal veins via an AV shunt in the intervertebral foramen. Intramedullary AVM's were defined as having the AV shunt contained at least partially within the cord or pia and receiving arterial supply by medullary arteries. Of the 81 patients, 27 (33%) had dural AV fistulas and 54 (67%) had intradural AVM's. Several dissimilarities in clinical and radiographic findings of the two subgroups were evident. The patients with intramedullary AVM's were younger; the age at onset of symptoms averaged 27 years compared to 49 years for dural AV fistulas. The most common initial symptom associated with dural AV fistulas was steadily progressive paresis, whereas hemorrhage was the most common presenting symptom in cases of intramedullary lesions. No patients with dural AV fistulas had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Activity exacerbated symptoms more frequently in patients with dural lesions. Associated vascular anomalies occurred only in cases of intradural AVM's. In 96% of the dural lesions the AV nidus was in the low thoracic or lumbar region; in only 15% did the intercostal or lumbar arteries supplying the AVM also provide a medullary artery which supplied the spinal cord. In contrast, most intradural AVM's (84%) were in the cervical or thoracic segments of the spinal cord and all of them were supplied by medullary arteries. Transit of contrast medium through the intradural AVM's was rapid in 80% of cases, suggesting high-flow lesions. Forty-four percent of the patients with AVM's of the spinal cord had associated saccular arterial or venous spinal aneurysms. No dural AV fistulas displayed these characteristics. A good outcome occurred in 88% of patients with dural AV fistulas after nidus obliteration, while 49% of patients with intramedullary AVM's did well after surgery or embolization. These findings suggest that dural and intradural AVM's differ in etiology (acquired vs. congenital) and that they have different pathophysiology, radiographic findings, clinical presentation, and response to treatment.\r"

In this study, biopsy specimens of 31 pituitary adenomas representing all major endocrine types were examined. All adenomas contained proliferating cells and the percentage of nuclei that were immunoreactive to Ki-67 ranged from 0.1% to 3.7%. Low values (0.1% to 1.0%) were present in 11 endocrine-inactive adenomas and higher values (1.1% to 1.5%) were found in six acromegalic patients. The percentages of Ki-67-positive cells in 12 prolactinomas and two adenomas from patients with Cushing's disease covered the entire range (0.1% to 3.7%). Preoperative bromocriptine treatment of prolactinomas did not influence Ki-67 expression. Invasive adenomas, as determined by preoperative computerized tomography, surgical observation, and histological examination of the sella dura demonstrated significantly higher Ki-67 values (average 1.15%) than noninvasive adenomas (average 0.60%). Determination of the incidence of proliferating cells by Ki-67 immunoreactivity represents a new tool for intraoperative quantitative assessment of tumor growth characteristics and may aid in the planning of adjuvant therapy and estimation of prognosis.\r"

Dopamine agonists were administered orally to 17 patients, intramuscularly to three patients, and both orally and intramuscularly to five patients. Repeated computerized tomography (CT) examinations revealed that all neoplasms except one cystic tumor were reduced in size during the course of dopamine-agonist administration. No complications attributable to medical pretreatment were observed. Tumor shrinkage increased the efficacy of surgery, especially in cases with considerable extrasellar extension of the adenomas. Within 3 months following adenomectomy, prolactin levels were adjusted to normal levels in 19 patients by additional low-dose treatment with dopamine agonists. Thin-collimation CT assessments performed at least 3 months after surgery showed no evidence of residual tumor tissue in 23 patients. It is concluded that administration of dopamine agonists for some weeks prior to surgery is a useful adjunct to transsphenoidal microsurgery for macroprolactinomas. The new injectable form of bromocriptine is particularly valuable for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy exists regarding the effects of bromocriptine on the success of transsphenoidal surgery for patients with prolactinomas. Various studies on this drug have reported adverse effects, improvement, and no effect upon the subsequent surgical outcome. The authors have retrospectively reviewed the case histories of 55 patients with immunocytochemically confirmed prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas operated on by a transsphenoidal approach between 1981 and 1985. All patients had received bromocriptine in a variety of doses and for variable durations prior to surgery. Thirty-nine patients were women and 16 were men, with an age range of 8 to 72 years. Basal prolactin levels prior to bromocriptine treatment ranged from 38 to 100 ng/ml in 11 patients, from 101 to 200 ng/ml in 12, and greater than 200 ng/ml in 29. The \"cure\" rates were 54%, 58%, and 38%, respectively. Thirty-one patients had microadenomas, with a postoperative cure rate of 68%; 12 had diffuse expansive adenomas, with a 17% cure rate; and 12 had grossly invasive tumors, with a 17% cure rate. A response to preoperative bromocriptine therapy was defined as a return of the basal prolactin level to normal: 18 patients were responders and 29 were hyporesponders; in eight the data were not available. The postoperative cure rate was 50% for the responders and 31% for the hyporesponders. Taking into account the distribution of tumor type, there was no actual difference in outcome between the responder and the hyporesponder groups. The total bromocriptine dose received preoperatively was nearly identical for all groups. No significant differences in the frequency or extent of fibrosis, calcification, or prolactin immunoreactivity were observed in the 55 patients when compared with 26 control prolactinomas not treated with bromocriptine. It is concluded that short-term bromocriptine treatment does not adversely affect surgical outcome in any of the prolactin-secreting adenoma groups, nor does response or lack of response to bromocriptine predict surgical outcome.\r"

The PVI and ICP measurements were obtained serially, and the temporal course of the pressure-volume status and ICP was determined during the 5-day period following injury. Aggressiveness of ICP was quantified by a therapy intensity level scale. A clear relationship between the PVI measured soon after injury and subsequent development of ICP emerged. Following mechanical trauma the PVI is reduced, and the degree of reduction and extent of biomechanical recovery are closely related to outcome and development of raised ICP.\r"

Patients were classified by the extent of surgical resection: total, nearly total (90% to 99% resection), subtotal (less than 90% resection), or biopsy. Thirty-one patients received irradiation as part of their primary treatment. Total resection of tumor, without irradiation, was associated with a 3% chance of local recurrence. One of 15 patients who had nearly total resection of their tumor and did not receive postoperative irradiation suffered a recurrence, compared with neither of the two patients who received postoperative irradiation (greater than 45 Gy) following nearly total resection. Postoperative irradiation (greater than 45 Gy) decreased the recurrence rate after subtotal resection from 46% (six of 13 cases without irradiation) to 6% (one of 17 cases: p = 0.01). All three patients treated by biopsy alone received postoperative irradiation (greater than 45 Gy), and none had a recurrence. Six patients were treated with preoperative irradiation because of excessive tumor vascularity; four are without evidence of disease 12 to 23 years later. Only three of seven patients treated with irradiation for tumor recurrence after surgical resection survived. It is concluded that postoperative irradiation significantly decreased the chance for local tumor progression following subtotal resection of acoustic neurilemoma, and that postoperative irradiation may be effective therapy following treatment by biopsy. Patients with total or nearly total resection appeared not to benefit from postoperative irradiation.\r"

Accumulation of vascular permeability factor (VPF) activity occurs with increasing duration of tumor incubation in vitro. Expression of this activity is inhibited by incubation of cell cultures with cycloheximide or dexamethasone. This VPF is an acid-stable heat-labile macromolecule that is inactivated by trypsin and pepsin and binds immobilized heparin. Activity is retained by ultrafiltration with 30,000-dalton cut-off microconcentrators. Pretreatment of test animals with systemic dexamethasone prior to intradermal injection of VPF diminishes microvascular permeability. Furthermore, VPF activity is not inhibited by antihistamines. Secretion of VPF may cause the vasogenic brain edema that is frequently associated with malignant primary and metastatic intracerebral tumors. Inhibition by dexamethasone of both VPF expression in tissue culture, and VPF activity at the microvascular level in test animals, is in keeping with the known efficacy of this agent in treating the vasogenic edema associated with brain tumors.\r"

The Rh-123 photosensitization was produced by direct intratumoral injection of Rh-123 into the mouse RT2 flank tumors and by intravenous Rh-123 administration to adult rats with implanted RT2 intracerebral tumors. Intratumoral irradiation with 150 mW of argon laser light for an exposure time of 15 minutes was performed using a conical sapphire-tipped quartz optical fiber. Control groups of animals received either no treatment, Rh-123 injections, or administration of 150 mW of argon laser light for 15 minutes. Both flank and intracerebral tumors showed progressive diminution in size after treatment with Rh-123 photochemotherapy. There was no evidence of tumor recurrence in 60% of Rh-123 photochemotherapy-treated tumors. Recurrences in tumors treated with Rh-123 photochemotherapy usually appeared at the periphery of the original tumor at 10 days after treatment. Histologically, photochemotherapy-treated intracerebral tumors showed progressive shrinkage with increasing tumor necrosis over time. The finding of residual or recurrent tumor at the periphery of the original tumor mass suggests that the lack of penetration of the blue-green (argon) light was responsible for preventing complete tumor ablation. Our results suggest that Rh-123 photochemotherapy can destroy malignant gliomas in vivo; however, the poor penetrability of the photoactivating blue-green light may limit the effectiveness of this treatment for large or extensively invasive tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) function was studied in 14 normal dogs at time periods from 7 to 717 days after permanent insertion of 5- to 7-mCi seeds of iodine-125 (125I) for interstitial radiation. The BBB function was measured with carbon-14-labeled alpha aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) and quantitative autoradiography, and expressed as a unidirectional blood-to-brain transfer constant, K. The 125I radiation lesions consisted of three concentric histologically and functionally distinct zones: 1) a central zone of calcified necrosis; 2) a spongy fluid-filled zone; and 3) a narrow rim (2.6 +/- 0.6 mm wide) of viable brain tissue with increased permeability. Within this rim, the mean value of the K of AIB was 5.8 times that of normal cortex. Over the 7- to 392-day time period the value of K remained rather constant, and by 716 days K values had returned to normal. There was moderate regional variation in the value of K; it was highest in the white matter and lowest in the gray matter surrounding the radiation lesion. The radiation lesion progressively increased in size from 7 to 80 days, after which there was little change. This study illustrates that the geographically circumscribed radiation from 125I seeds is accompanied by similarly well-defined changes in BBB function, which may persist for over 1 year following insertion of the 125I seed. This altered BBB function is probably responsible for the cerebral edema associated with 125I interstitial radiotherapy.\r"

Propranolol at a dose of 40 mg/12 hrs also seemed to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and thoracic aorta, although the differences were less dramatic. There were minimal differences in the extent of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta or femoral arteries of animals in either treatment group as compared with the control group. Similarly, the chemical composition of these same major vessels showed no significant differences. Therefore, in the face of severe atherogenic stimuli, chemical or surgical sympathectomy may be useful in controlling atherosclerosis in specific arterial beds.\r"

The authors report three cases of extracerebral cavernous hemangioma in the middle fossa that were treated with radiotherapy. The follow-up studies with serial computerized tomography (CT) scans during and after irradiation are described. In Case 1 radiotherapy after partial removal of the tumor decreased the tumor size on the contrast-enhanced CT scans, reduced its Hounsfield units on the nonenhanced CT scans, and facilitated later total tumor removal. In Case 2 the tumor responded to irradiation with approximately 3000 rads, showing significant reduction in size and Hounsfield units of the tumor. Subtotal removal was then possible. In Case 3 the tumor responded to irradiation, and the patient's vertigo improved after delivery of approximately 3000 rads. The CT scan showed significant reduction in the size and Hounsfield units of the tumor. No surgical intervention was deemed necessary. It is concluded that, in cases of extracerebral cavernous hemangioma with massive hemorrhage, irradiation with up to 3000 rads may be the treatment of choice. Radiation therapy offers an increased probability of total removal of the tumor and the possibility of eliminating surgery.\r"

In these complexes, selected for potential use as myocardial imaging agents, L represents one of the two tetradentate Schiff base ligands N,N'-ethylenebis(acetylacetone iminato), (en), or N,N'-propylene-1,2-bis(acetylacetone iminato), (pn), while Y represents a monodentate phosphine, phosphite or isonitrile ligand as exemplified by P(CH3)3, P(OCH3)3 and CN-C(CH3)3. Of these 15 complexes, several with octanol/saline partition coefficients in the range 0.04-20 exhibit significant myocardial uptake in rats and dogs. Of these, none exhibit detectable myocardial washout, providing strong support for the hypothesis that myocardial washout occurs only for those 99mTc(III) cations that undergo in vivo reduction to the neutral 99mTc(II) form.

Constant-infusion renal whole-blood clearance obtained with [99mTc] MAG3 kits was compared with that obtained with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pure [99mTc]MAG3 and with co-infused iodine-131 (131I) iodohippurate (OIH) in anesthetized rats. Average renal whole-blood clearance of [99mTc]MAG3 from kits was 3.9 +/- 0.4 ml/min/100 g body weight (mean +/- s.e.m. n = 5) and that for HPLC-pure [99mTc]MAG3 was 4.6 +/- 0.3 (n = 3). Renal whole-blood clearance ratios for [99mTc]MAG3 to co-infused iodine-131 (131I) OIH were greater than unity for both kit formulation (1.7 +/- 0.1) and HPLC-pure [99mTc]MAG3 (1.9 +/- 0.2). Differences in these two measures were not significant. Plasma binding (determined from blood drawn at the end of the infusion) of [99mTc]MAG3 prepared from both kits (75 +/- 2%, n = 4) and HPLC-separation (76 +/- 4%) were greater than that of [131I]OIH in corresponding plasma samples (31 +/- 1% and 32 +/- 2%) respectively). Renograms performed in anesthetized rats revealed no statistically significant differences between kit-prepared [99mTc]MAG3 and [131I]OIH in terms of time-to-peak renal activity (5.0 +/- 1.7 min, n = 6; and 2.2 +/- 0.2 min, n = 3, mean +/- s.e.m. for [99mTc]MAG3 and [131I]OIH, respectively), in terms of time to fall to half-maximal activity (15.3 +/- 2.4 min and 9.6 +/- 2.1 min, respectively), or in terms of fraction of peak radioactivity in right kidney (0.53 +/- 0.01 for both substances). To assess possible interference from hepatobiliary uptake and excretion in renal failure, radioactivity in liver regions of interest was followed by gamma camera scintigraphy for 30 min after intravenous injection of [131I]OIH and kit and HPLC-purified [99mTc]MAG3 in anesthetized rats rendered anephric by ligating renal peduncles. Liver activity was 25% of total for both preparations of [99mTc]MAG3 and was 22% of total for [131I]OIH. There were no significant differences among the substances.\r"

However, it is not rare to find a patient with detectable serum Tg levels but negative 131I whole-body scan (WBS) and no evidence of disease activity. To clarify the reason for this discrepancy, we decided to perform the WBS after the administration of a therapeutic dose of 131I in 17 consecutive patients in whom serum Tg was detectable while the WBS performed with a 5 mCi tracer dose was negative (12.6% of 135 patients studied with both WBS and serum Tg). The result of this study demonstrated that after this procedure the WBS became positive for significant residual or metastatic areas of radioiodine uptake in all patients but one. Such data indicate that in our patients the presence of circulating Tg is not a false-positive Tg result, but is due to the presence of residual or metastatic tissue that is not detected in the conventional WBS, that can be visualized using therapeutic doses. Preliminary follow-up data indicate that this procedure may also have therapeutic effect, although the relevance of this aspect remains to be established.\r"

Radioaerosol inhalation lung cine-scintigraphy was very useful in revealing the changes not only in the deposition patterns of inhaled aerosol in the lungs but also in the dynamic transport of mucus on the airways. The bronchodilating effect of the combined treatment was significant; the inhaled aerosol deposited more homogeneously and less centrally in the lungs, the \"penetration index\" and the alveolar deposition ratio (ALDR) increased from 31 +/- 3 to 49 +/- 7%, and from 29 +/- 2% to 39 +/- 1%, respectively, while the airway deposition ratio (ADR) decreased from 72 +/- 2 to 61 +/- 1% immediately after the treatment. Lung function data including FVC, FEV 1.0, FEV 1.0%, MMF, V50 and Vp significantly improved after the treatment. There was, however, little visual or quantitative improvement in mucociliary clearance after the treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We have confirmed that arginine-deficient diets increase the liver activities (units per 100 g) of the first four arginine biosynthetic enzymes of the urea cycle in Wistar rats, but not the activity of arginase. In contrast, rat liver cells cultured in monolayers for 48, 72 or 96 h in arginine-free L-15 or minimum essential medium showed no changes in carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.4.16), ornithine transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.3), argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5), argininosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.1) or arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) activities. The arginine content of the cells grown on deficient medium was 36% of that of cells grown on 2.9 mM arginine-sufficient L-15, yet the urea excretion rate into the medium was reduced to 7% of the rate in control cells and the excretion of orotic acid was 400% of that in control cells. A Morris rat hepatoma cell line, 7800C1, which maintains activities of all five urea cycle enzymes, showed no consistent increases in the activities of the first four enzymes when the arginine in the medium was varied between 0 and 2 mM. Thus, in spite of severe arginine deficiency, cultured rat liver cells and hepatoma cells do not show the derepression-like response seen by other investigators when nonliver cells were cultured in arginine-deficient media. The difference between in vivo and in vitro effects of arginine deficiency on urea cycle activities remains unexplained.\r"

The diets with added Met caused a reduction in food intake (FI) on the second day and a negative body weight gain (BWG), in proportion to the level of added Met. After 10 d, kittens fed the 2 and 3% Met diets increased their FI and had positive BWG. During the last 10 d of the experiment, the control, 2% Met and 3% Met groups had BWG of 28, 15 and 0 g/d, respectively. Kittens given the 4% Met diet showed no adaptation and continued to lose weight. In these kittens plasma concentration of Met was 50-70 times and cystathionine about three times greater than in control kittens. Four male kittens were fed the same 4% Met diet for 6 wk and then switched to a diet containing 4% L-Met plus 4% glycine (Gly) for 12 d. Average daily FI was 21.4 +/- 1.3 g with 4% Met and 48.5 +/- 2.5 g after the addition of Gly, and BWG went from negative to positive. These results indicate that growing kittens are more sensitive than rats to excess Met and have a limited adaptive capacity. Kittens did not grow normally when the diet contained 2% or more dietary Met, which was equivalent to 0.6 g Met/(kg body wt.d).\r"

A subgroup (PN) was born of mothers that also received low or control levels of protein throughout pregnancy. The deprived groups weighed significantly less than corresponding control groups. Weights of the total brain, cerebellum and brain stem were significantly reduced in the PN deprived group. Analysis of variance also indicated that low protein diets produced a significant reduction in cerebral weight. The concentrations of DNA, protein and eight different lipids from seven different sites in the central and peripheral nervous system were not greatly affected by diet. The total content of lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine was significantly depressed in some parts of the deprived monkey brains. The deficits in brain weight of the PN group (10% for the cerebrum, 13% for the cerebellum and 18% for the brain stem) were very similar to those observed previously in 1-mo-old monkeys born of protein-deprived mothers and fed low protein diets postnatally. On the other hand, monkeys born of adequately nourished mothers and then fed low protein diets from birth up to 12 yr showed no deficit in brain weight despite reduction in body weight to less than half of control values.\r"

At 3 wk of age, the birds were weighed and the feathers scored for softness. Feather strength (i.e., force-displacement curves) was determined on feathers from the pectoral tract. A significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in body weight and an increase in feather softness were seen when chicks fed the control diet and those fed the diet with 1.45% added methionine were compared. Chicks fed the diet supplemented with 0.203% L-cysteine produced the strongest feathers; those fed diets supplemented with 1.45% DL-methionine produced the weakest feathers. Volatile sulfur compounds released from the feathers were trapped as dinitrophenyl (DNP) thioethers and were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. More bound sulfide (P less than 0.05) was recovered from feathers of chickens fed the diet supplemented with 1.45% methionine than from feathers of chickens fed the other diets. The feather softness score was correlated (r = 0.5; P less than 0.05) with bound sulfide. Thus, consumption of a diet with a level of methionine that is approximately three times the requirement resulted in decreased growth, elevated sulfide bound to the feathers and soft, weak feathers.\r"

Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxal concentrations in pregnant rats were 20 and 40% of those of nonpregnant rats, respectively. Excretion of 4-pyridoxic acid in the urine in pregnant rats was about 40% of that of nonpregnant rats. Liver PLP content was also lower during pregnancy, but liver pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), kidney PLP and PMP and muscle PLP contents did not change significantly. Progesterone administration to ovariectomized rats resulted in slightly lower plasma, liver and kidney PLP levels than in intact untreated control rats. Liver and kidney pyridoxal kinase (PK) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase activities were similar in pregnant and nonpregnant rats. Progesterone treatment resulted in a significantly lower PK activity in the kidney of the treated rats than in untreated controls. It is concluded that the pregnancy-induced changes in vitamin B-6 metabolism were unlikely to be related directly to progesterone. However, progesterone may secondarily affect maternal vitamin B-6 stores during pregnancy, by temporary deposition and increased retention of vitamin B-6.\r"

  ".W": "Because disturbances in iron metabolism might contribute to the teratogenicity of zinc deficiency, we examined the effect of zinc deficiency on fetal iron accumulation and maternal and fetal retention of 59Fe. Pregnant rats were fed from mating a purified diet containing 0.5, 4.5 or 100 micrograms Zn/g. Laparotomies were performed on d 12, 16, 19 and 21 of gestation. Maternal blood and concepti were analyzed for zinc and iron. Additional groups of dams fed 0.5 or 100 micrograms Zn/g diet were gavaged on d 19 with a diet containing 59Fe. Six hours later maternal blood and tissues, fetuses and placentas were counted for 59Fe. Maternal plasma zinc, but not iron, concentration was affected by zinc deficiency on d 12. Embryo zinc concentration on d 12 increased with increasing maternal dietary zinc, whereas iron concentration was not different among groups. On d 16-21 plasma iron was higher in dams fed 0.5 micrograms Zn/g diet than in those fed 4.5 or 100 micrograms/g, whereas plasma zinc was lower in dams fed 0.5 or 4.5 micrograms Zn/g than in those fed 100 micrograms Zn/g diet. On d 19 zinc concentration in fetuses from dams fed 0.5 micrograms/g zinc was not different from that of those fed 4.5 micrograms/g zinc, and iron concentration was higher in the 0.5 microgram Zn/g diet group. The increase in iron concentration in zinc-deficient fetuses thus occurs too late to be involved in major structural teratogenesis. Although whole blood concentration of 59Fe was not different in zinc-deficient and control dams, zinc-deficient dams had more 59Fe in the plasma fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Zinc deficiency in rats causes increased osmotic fragility of their erythrocytes. This study was designed to determine the relationship of food intake and dietary sulfur amino acid level to the effect of low zinc status on fragility. Immature rats were fed for a 3-wk period a low zinc diet (less than 1 mg/kg) based on isolated soybean protein or a similar control diet (100 mg Zn/kg diet) supplied either ad libitum or by pair feeding. Fragility was measured by the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solutions. In the first experiment, zinc deficiency resulted in higher fragility than in ad libitum controls; pair-fed controls were intermediate and not different from either. Experiment 2 included two levels of methionine, 0.4 and 0.9%, and two of zinc, 0 and 100 mg Zn/kg diet. At the 0.4%, but not at the 0.9% methionine level, hemolysis of red blood cells from the zinc-deficient rats was significantly greater than those from either pair-fed or ad libitum controls. Repletion for 1 or 2 d completely alleviated the increased fragility, but in vitro addition of zinc had no effect. Restricted intake of the zinc-adequate diet reversed the fragility within 1 d as readily as did ad libitum intake. Thus, the osmotic fragility induced by zinc deficiency was prevented by high sulfur amino acid intake and was readily reversed by dietary zinc. It is postulated that extracellular or membrane-bound zinc protects a component of the membrane that is essential to its function, and that reversal of the defect requires an in vivo metabolic process.\r"

  ".W": "High magnesium (Mg) diets induce diarrhea in chicks. Addition of 0.3, 0.5 or 0.9% Mg (as MgO) to a corn-soy basal diet caused a dose-related lower gut passage time (GPT) (the first appearance of colored markers from feed in excreta), with the threshold for catharsis being approximately the 0.3% addition. Supplementation of the high Mg diets with a water-absorbent clay did not change the chicks' GPT. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (1.68 mg/kg body wt) or the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (0.28 mg/kg body wt) did not effect the GPT of chicks fed high Mg diets. However, both the muscarinic blocker methscopolamine (0.12 mg/kg body wt) and the serotonergic blocker methysergide (0.2 mg/kg body wt) resulted in a higher GPT of chicks fed high Mg diets compared to corn-soy fed control chicks. Analysis of the osmotic load of excreta or intestinal contents of high Mg-fed chicks showed no differences from osmotic loads of control-fed chicks. When the osmotic loads observed were partitioned into mineral cationic and anionic components, the Mg content was found to be higher in intestines of chicks, but this higher Mg was paralleled and/or surpassed by chloride (Cl) content. From these data the authors conclude that Mg-induced cartharsis is due not simply to the hyperosmotic effect of Mg per se but to neural or endocrine arcs that affect the secretion or absorption of Cl as well.\r"

  ".W": "Zinc availability from a series of foods was determined using 65Zn-labeled test meals fed to rats. Zinc availability relative to zinc chloride depended on the amount of the zinc source in the test meal. Zinc availability from several foods was similar to that from zinc chloride when tested in smaller amounts, but enhanced when fed in larger amounts. The range of zinc availability was similar for foods of plant and animal origin. Rats retained significantly more zinc from pork, chicken, peanut butter, egg or milk than from rice, beef, soybean flour or navy beans. Foods with intermediate zinc availability were sweet corn, whole wheat bread, cheese and oysters. Several food characteristics were examined for possible relationships with zinc availability, including the solubility or molecular size of zinc compounds after an in vitro enzymatic digestion and the contents of phytic acid, minerals, amino acids, carbohydrate and fatty acids relative to the zinc content of the food. Protein and several amino acids predicted about half of the variance in zinc availability. Following in vitro enzymatic digestion, neither zinc solubility nor the partitioning of zinc between low and high molecular weight substances was a strong predictor of zinc availability.\r"

In the pH range 5.5-7.0, the amount of protein-silicic acid complex measured turbidimetrically increased with decreasing pH. Only a trace of precipitate occurred with use of either of the protein sources at pH 7 or with NDUS at pH 6.5. With BSA at pH 6.5, phosphate supplying the total IS of the solution completely prevented precipitation of the complex. The phosphate effect was linear when it supplied 20-50% of the IS. In this range, there was a 12.3% reduction in the amount of precipitate for each 10% of the IS supplied by phosphate. With NDUS at pH 6.0, the phosphate effect was linear over its full range of concentrations. The phosphate effect resulted in an 8.7% reduction in the amount of precipitate for each 10% of the IS supplied by phosphate. On removal of the precipitated protein-silicic acid complex from the silicic acid solution, dissolution was facilitated by increases in phosphate concentration and pH. It is concluded that phosphate inhibition of protein-polysilicic acid complex formation may play a role in the reduction of silica urolithiasis related to increases in dietary phosphate.\r"

Dietary ratios and concentrations for indispensable amino acids (IAA) and arginine were calculated using the parameter K0.5. A curve shift technique was used to determine dietary concentrations for conditionally indispensable amino acids (CAA) and dispensable amino acids (DAA). The model was also used to determine a dietary ratio of (IAA + Arg)/(CAA + DAA). Using the dietary amino acid concentrations suggested by the model and an (IAA + Arg)/(CAA + DAA) ratio of 1, a growth response curve was constructed and compared to a similar curve using the amino acid mix of Rogers and Harper. The modeling approach produced a 10-15% improvement in growth over the Rogers and Harper mix. The SKM is discussed in terms of calculating an ideal nutrient ratio and choosing a desired response level. It is demonstrated that the model can rapidly produce accurate estimates for dietary amino acid levels, while minimizing required numbers of laboratory animals.\r"

Taurine concentrations in plasma, platelets, granulocytes and erythrocytes declined significantly with decreased dietary taurine. In the cats that did not receive the 5.0% cystine supplement, the relationship between dietary taurine intake and plasma and blood cell taurine level was nonlinear. The greatest increment in taurine concentrations occurred between the 0.02 and 0.05% taurine intakes. These findings suggest that the dietary taurine requirement for adult cats may be between 0.02 and 0.05%. Supplementation of the 0% taurine diet with 5.0% L-cystine raised taurine levels above those of the taurine-deficient diets in plasma and all blood cell types. The result of this study therefore suggest a close relationship between dietary taurine intake and blood cell taurine levels in cats. Five percent L-cystine stimulates taurine synthesis in these animals.\r"

Underfed dams gained more weight in the second pregnancy and retained more weight than in the first pregnancy. Dams and pups in all groups were larger at the second parturition.

These results indicate that repeated reproductive cycles did not compromise maternal nutritional status, lactational performance or litter growth.

On one occasion the beverage was not sweetened; on the other occasion, the beverage provided 10 mg APM/kg body weight. Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured throughout the 2-h study period. The addition of 10 mg APM/kg body weight to the beverage had no significant effect on plasma aspartate concentration. APM ingestion increased plasma phenylalanine levels of normal subjects from a mean +/- SD baseline value of 5.09 +/- 0.82 mumol/dL to a high mean value of 6.73 +/- 0.75 mumol/dL. In PKU heterozygous subjects the plasma phenylalanine level increased from a mean +/- SD of 9.04 +/- 1.71 to a high mean value of 12.1 +/- 2.08 mumol/dL.

At 12 months of age, infants fed cow milk had significantly lower mean serum ferritin levels and mean corpuscular volume, higher free erythrocyte protoporphyrin values, and greater incidence of hemoglobin values less than 11 g/dl than did formula-fed infants. There were no significant differences in frequency of otitis media, wheezing episodes, nasal discharge or congestion, diaper dermatitis, constipation, guaiac-positive stools, or hospital admissions between the two groups. These data suggest that, to avoid iron deficiency, infants should continue to receive iron-fortified formula throughout the first year of life or a daily iron supplement if they are fed whole cow milk before their first birthday.\r"

Most episodes occurred within 3 months of the operation. Factors associated with cholangitis included good or partial restoration of bile flow, abnormal intrahepatic bile ducts or cavities at the porta hepatis, and routine postoperative use of antibiotics. External jejunostomy was not effective in preventing cholangitis. In addition to fever and decreased bile flow, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and signs of shock were frequently observed. The responsible organisms, most often gram-negative bacteria, were identified in 79 (75%) episodes by blood or liver cultures. Most were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and third-generation cephalosporins during the first episode, but only to cephalosporins during later episodes. The incidence of signs of portal hypertension in children with normal serum bilirubin values at age 5 years was not higher in those who had previously experienced one or more episodes of cholangitis.\r"

D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) is a water-soluble investigational form of vitamin E that is well absorbed during cholestasis. We studied the effect of TPGS therapy on the neurologic function in 12 children with vitamin E deficiency (aged 9 months to 6 years) with prolonged forms of neonatal cholestasis. Each child had failed to respond to up to 100 to 200 IU/kg/d of standard oral preparations of vitamin E. Treatment with 15 to 25 IU/kg/d TPGS for a mean of 19.3 months normalized the biochemical indices of vitamin E status and was well tolerated by all patients. Neurologic function, assessed by serial neurologic examinations, remained normal during therapy in the two children with no neurologic symptoms younger than age 3 years at onset of therapy. Neurologic function, which had deteriorated before this study, improved in six of seven patients with symptoms who were younger than 3 years and in all three with symptoms older than 3 years. TPGS appears to be a safe and effective form of orally administered vitamin E for use in children with chronic cholestasis who are unresponsive to available oral preparations of vitamin E.\r"

For comparison of the low birth weight (LBW) rate at different altitudes, certain socioeconomic risk factors known to affect birth weight were controlled by the selection of an idealized subpopulation of singleton births. With 500 m gradations for altitude, a curvilinear dose-response relationship of birth weight reduction with increasing altitude was demonstrated (P less than 0.001). In comparison with neonates born at sea level, neonates born at higher altitudes (greater than 2000 m) had a twofold to threefold increase in LBW rate, mainly related to a higher incidence of intrauterine growth retardation. Comparison of the LBW rate on the basis of small geographic divisions in the mountain states showed a positive correlation between the LBW rate and the high altitude. The birth weight frequency distribution curves of the idealized subpopulation at each altitude approximate normal distributions and parallel one another, indicating that altitude has a general effect on all births. Such nearly normal birth weight distributions allowed the determination of altitude-specific LBW cutoff limits that can be used to detect areas of greater risk for LBW but independent of the altitude effect.\r"

Five mothers had symptoms and signs of threatened abortion and/or threatened preterm labor. Three mothers gave birth more than 6 weeks after the episodes, and their babies were those infected in utero. The other two gave birth within 1 week after the episodes, and the two babies were treated with HBIG immediately after birth; HBV infection was successfully prevented. Therefore we suggest that transplacental leakage of HBeAg-positive maternal blood, which is induced by uterine contractions during pregnancy and the disruption of placental barriers, is the most likely route to cause HBV intrauterine infection.\r"

The efficacy of the treatment was expressed as actual (milligrams per hour) and quantum (milligrams per hour per square centimeter per megawatt) efficiency, taking into account the differential emission of energy from the green versus the blue fluorescent tubes. No statistically significant difference in the rate of serum bilirubin photodegradation was found between the two groups after treatment for 84.6 +/- 14.1 hours versus 81.5 +/- 14.2 hours with the green and the blue phototherapy, respectively. These results, coupled with the known effects of the blue light on the genetic apparatus of mammalian cells, support the application of the green light phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia caused by ABO incompatibility.\r"

Nine term infants (mean postconceptional age: 38.6 +/- 0.7 SD weeks; mean postnatal age: 18.4 +/- 6.1 SD days) and nine preterm infants (mean postconceptional age: 35.2 +/- 0.7 SD weeks; mean postnatal age: 21.9 +/- 5.4 SD days) were studied under identical feeding conditions. Preterm infants generated significantly lower peak pressure (mean values of 48.5 cm H2O compared with 65.5 cm H2O in term infants; P less than 0.01), and the volume ingested per such was generally less than or equal to 0.5 mL. Term infants demonstrated a higher frequency of sucking, a well-defined suck-pause pattern, and a higher minute consumption of formula. Energy and caloric expenditure estimations revealed significantly lower work performed by preterm infants for isovolumic feeds (1190 g/cm/dL in preterm infants compared with 2030 g.cm/dL formula ingested in term infants; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, work performed by term infants was disproportionately higher for volumes greater than or equal to 0.5 mL ingested. This study indicates that preterm infants expend less energy than term infants to suck the same volume of feed and also describes an objective technique to evaluate nutritive sucking during growth and development.\r"

Studies included determination of weight, body mass index (weight for height2), percent body fat, blood pressure and resting heart rate, maximum heart rate and maximum oxygen consumption, and plasma lipids and lipoproteins. No significant differences were present between the two groups before training except that percent body fat was lower in the control subjects. After training, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the exercising subjects decreased from 120 +/- 15 to 95 +/- 13 mg/dL (P less than 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 35 +/- 12 to 45 +/- 8 mg/dL (P less than 0.01), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio increased from 0.2 +/- 0.06 to 0.27 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.001). Control subjects showed a significant increase in weight (P less than 0.01) and body mass index (P less than 0.01) and a decrease in maximum heart rate (P less than 0.01) at the end of the 9 weeks. Adjustment for body mass index resulted in no alteration in the favorable response of the lipoprotein profile. No change occurred in body composition or maximum oxygen consumption with training. These findings indicate that resistive training is associated with a favorable alteration in the lipoprotein profile in adolescent males.\r"

In eight patients the disease activity decreased, as substantiated by the reduction in the amount of steroid required to control the clinical manifestations. Interruption of cyclosporine treatment was associated with relapse or worsening of disease in five subjects. These favorable clinical results occurred in the absence of changes in the levels of antinuclear, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid autoantibodies or plasma complement components; plasma IgG concentration increased significantly. Six patients had signs of moderate cyclosporine nephrotoxicity that disappeared when the administration of the drug was discontinued. Hypertension was the most serious side effect observed in eight subjects; in every case it was controlled by antihypertensive medicine. These data indicate that cyclosporine may be beneficial in the treatment of some patients with severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene (LT)C4 and LTD4-induced contractile effects in guinea pig pulmonary parenchyma were distinguished by their sensitivity to calcium channel blockers. LTC4-induced contractions were inhibited in a noncompetitive manner in the presence of calcium channel blockers, whereas LTD4 contractions were unaffected. In the presence of diltiazem, maximum LTC4-induced (1 X 10(-7) M) contractions were reduced by 24% and the concentration-effect curve was shifted to the right in a nonparallel manner; diltiazem had no significant effect on the LTD4 response. We used this differential sensitivity to calcium channel blockade to permit pharmacological characterization in guinea pig pulmonary parenchyma of the interaction of the competitive LT blocker FPL55712 and the putative LTD4 receptor, LTRd. We showed, using [3H]LTC4, that at least 15% of LTC4 is converted to LTD4 under our experimental conditions. We performed a Schild analysis of the inhibition of LTD4-induced contractions by FPL55712 in the presence of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem (0.67 mM). The Kb derived from this analysis (3.2 X 10(-7) M) agrees closely with the Ki derived for the interaction of FPL55712 and specific LTD4 binding in lung membranes. A Schild analysis of the interaction of FPL55712 and LTC4 in the presence of diltiazem resulted in competitive inhibition with a Kb of 4.7 X 10(-7) M. This apparent competitive inhibition, combined with the similarity of these binding constants, suggests that diltiazem is effective in blocking LTC4-mediated responses and that when these effects are blocked, LTC4 induced contractions are mediated through LTRd. The differential effects of calcium blockade on these two agonists provides evidence for distinct coupling mechanisms for LT receptors in this tissue.\r"

We have conducted studies to examine: 1) binding characteristics of [3H]prazosin, 2) competition of antagonists at these sites and 3) different affinity states of the receptor for agonists and modulation of these states by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]. A plasma membrane-enriched vesicular fraction (F2; 15%/33% sucrose interphase) was prepared from the muscular medial layer of bovine thoracic aorta. [3H]Prazosin binding was characterized by a monophasic saturation isotherm (KD = 0.116 nM, Bmax = 112 fmol/mg of protein). Antagonist displacement studies yielded a relative potency order of prazosin greater than or equal to WB4104 much greater than phentolamine greater than corynanthine greater than yohimbine greater than or equal to idazoxan greater than rauwolscine. Competition curves for unlabeled prazosin, WB4101 (2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)-aminomethyl-1,4 benzodioxane) and phentolamine were shallow and were best modeled to two binding sites with picomolar and nanomolar KD values. Gpp(NH)p was without effect on antagonist affinity. Agonist (epinephrine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine) competition with [3H]prazosin binding was biphasic with pseudo-Hill slopes less than 1.0. Binding was best described by a two-site model in which the average contribution of high affinity sites was 23% of total binding. KD values for the high affinity site ranged from 2.9 to 18 nM, and 3.9 to 5.0 microM for the low affinity site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both the 0.3 and the 1.0 mg/kg of PMZ groups responded significantly less than vehicle controls after acute dosing without disrupting the operant response patterns as measured by index of curvature (IOC), and these effects persisted for 38 days of treatment. Acute treatment with 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg of CZP significantly suppressed operant response rates and disrupted the pattern of operant responding, in that the IOC was significantly lower for these subjects than for vehicle controls. The CZP-treated animals gradually developed tolerance to the drug effects and were performing at vehicle control levels after Day 7 of treatment. SID was assessed from Day 19 through Day 38 of neuroleptic treatment. PMZ suppressed the acquisition of SID. Animals treated with 1.0 and 0.3 mg/kg of PMZ consumed less water than controls and did not develop the postpellet drinking pattern characteristic of SID. Both the vehicle and 0.1 mg/kg of PMZ groups increased the amount of water they consumed across the 10 blocks of sessions. A dose-related suppression of SID also was noted for CZP-treated rats. Vehicle controls and three of the subjects treated with 10.0 mg/kg of CZP acquired the SID behavior.

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), an indirect serotonin (5-HT) agonist, were studied in conscious, unrestrained rats. PCA caused an immediate hypotension and bradycardia followed by a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), which lasted for 15 to 60 min, associated with variable effects on heart rate. An intermediate dose increased MAP and resistance in hindquarter and mesenteric, but not renal, vascular beds. The pressor effect of PCA was blocked by prazosin and by 6-hydroxydopamine plus adrenal demedullation, but not by 6-hydroxydopamine or adrenal demedullation separately. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine or beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol potentiated the pressor response to PCA, whereas several manipulations of central 5-HT systems (fluoxetine, methysergide and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine) reduced but did not eliminate the hypertension observed after PCA. The initial bradycardia and hypotension were abolished by chlorisondamine or atropine but not reduced by any other pretreatment, whereas the variable heart rate response was converted to a marked, sustained tachycardia by ganglionic blockade or atropine and to a consistent bradycardia by propranolol and peripheral sympathectomy. The data suggest that PCA causes an immediate central or reflex vagal activation to decrease heart rate and MAP, followed by a central 5-HT-mediated increase in sympathetic activity that increases MAP. Most of the pressor effect observed between 5 and 30 min after PCA appears to be mediated by a direct effect on release of norepinephrine and epinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals and the adrenal medulla, respectively. Only a minor part of the hemodynamic response to PCA appears to be attributable to its effect on release of 5-HT in the brain.\r"

Substrate did not affect the rate of the DCCD inactivation which followed pseudo-first-order-kinetics. A double logarithmic plot of the apparent rate constants vs. the DCCD concentration gave a straight line with a slope of 0.8. The data are consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction mechanism and imply that one molecule of DCCD inactivates one carboxylate group per active transport unit and that the carboxylate group is critical for transport.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the thromboxane (Tx) A2-receptor antagonists SQ 28,668 and SQ 30,741 on platelet function and renal artery thrombosis was studied in the dialurethane-anesthetized cynomolgus monkey. Both antagonists competitively inhibited the aggregation of platelet rich plasma in vitro to arachidonic acid and U-46,619, a Tx-mimetic. SQ 30,741 was 4 to 7 times more potent than SQ 28,668 against either of these agonists. Thrombotic cyclical blood flow reductions (CFRs) were elicited by placing a critical stenosis at a crush injury site on the left renal artery. After allowing 10 consecutive CFRs, of which 95% required shaking of the vessel to restore flow, a single i.v. injection of either SQ 28,668 (1 mg/kg, n = 6), SQ 30,741 (1 mg/kg, n = 8) or vehicle (2 ml of 0.2% Na2CO3 + 10% ethanol, n = 4) was administered. Antithrombotic activity was defined as the spontaneous restoration of flow and was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of flow decline during the CFRs. Spontaneous flow restoration was observed in animals treated with SQ 28,668 (five of six) and SQ 30,741 (six of eight) but not vehicle (zero of four). The rate of flow decline was reduced only with SQ 28,668 (56 +/- 8%) and SQ 30,741 (53 +/- 10%) treatments. The antithrombotic activities of SQ 28,668 and SQ 30,741 lasted 68 +/- 6 and 224 +/- 21 min, respectively. The threshold antithrombotic dose was found to be lower for SQ 30,741 (0.20 +/- 0.03 mg/kg) than SQ 28,668 (0.61 +/- 0.09 mg/kg) in additional experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It was observed experimentally that both theophylline and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) produced surmountable antagonism of the agonist effects of 2-chloroadenosine on purine receptors in rat vas deferens and guinea pig atria. In the case of IBMX, there was a statistically significant difference between the Schild regressions in the two tissues, ostensibly indicating a possible purine receptor heterogeneity with respect to the binding of this antagonist. However, the analysis was complicated by the fact that both theophylline and IBMX produced positive inotropic responses in guinea pig atria (presumably by inhibition of cardiac phosphodiesterase), making the calculation of dose ratios subjective and ambiguous. To determine whether the phosphodiesterase blocking property of theophylline and IBMX was interfering with the observation of purine receptor antagonism in guinea pig atria, a new technique described as pharmacologic resultant analysis was utilized to measure the purine receptor blocking properties of theophylline and IBMX in guinea pig atria in the presence of phosphodiesterase blockade. Based on the principle of additive dose ratios for two antagonists competing for one receptor, pharmacologic resultant analysis measures the effects of a test antagonist (in this case theophylline or IBMX) on the competitive blockade of a reference antagonist; for these studies, the reference antagonist was 8-sulfophenyltheophylline. Under these circumstances, the direct effects of the test antagonist (positive inotropy) are expressed throughout the experiment and cancel with the normal null methods used for measurement of competitive antagonism. Using this technique, it was found that the potencies of both theophylline and IBMX on the purine receptors in rat vas deferens and guinea pig atria were identical. The use of this method in the delineation of multiple drug activities is discussed.\r"

We studied the effects of peripherally administered (s.c.) mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor selective agonists on the rate of gastrointestinal transit in mice. We used peptidergic agonists with high peripheral selectivity (limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier) including [MePhe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017) (mu), [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) (delta) and Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile-Arg (dynorphin 1-9) (kappa). As peripheral selectivity is dose-related, we included the hot-plate test as an index of that dose at which each compound lost its peripheral selectivity and entered the central nervous system. When given s.c., [MePhe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin inhibited transit (IC50 = 0.37 mg/kg s.c.) at doses much lower than those needed to produce analgesia (A50 = 30 mg/kg s.c.), indicating that peripheral mu receptors can inhibit transit independently of central mu receptors. The independence of peripheral mu antitransit receptors from central receptors was demonstrated further as the lack of antagonism of s.c. [MePhe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin antitransit effects by simultaneous i.c.v. administration of the mu receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTP) (1 microgram i.c.v.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, was used to examine the regulation of [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) release by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-related mechanisms in myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparations of guinea pig small intestine. Forskolin evoked a dose-related increase in [3H]ACh release. Both dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP significantly elevated [3H]ACh secretion. In the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (theophylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), the basal [3H]ACh output was increased. There was a significantly greater stimulation when forskolin was used to incite endogenous cAMP synthesis and phosphodiesterase inhibitors were simultaneously applied to prevent cAMP breakdown. The enhancement of forskolin-stimulated release by theophylline or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine strongly implicates a synergistic interaction between the two. These findings suggest that forskolin acts to increase ACh release by a modulation of endogenous cAMP and further support a cAMP-mediated mechanism in the secretion of ACh from myenteric cholinergic neurons.\r"

  ".U": "88062111\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown previously that vascular adrenergic responsiveness is maintained with age in the face of reductions in norepinephrine (NE) content. To test the hypothesis that a concomitant decrease in neuronal NE uptake is responsible for maintenance of contractile responses with age, isolated blood vessel segments from Fischer 344 rats aged 6, 12, 20 and 27 months were studied. Renal artery and vein, femoral artery and vein and tail artery were stimulated with transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) with and without cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M). Similar to previous findings, frequency response curves for 200 pulse trains of TNS did not differ significantly with age, except for the 6 months tail artery at 1, 2 and 4 Hz and the 6 months renal artery at 1 Hz. After addition of cocaine, TNS responses for trains of 200 pulses were increased substantially. Comparison of responses to TNS in the presence of neuronal uptake blockade with cocaine demonstrated no significant differences with age except for the renal vein, where responses at 1 Hz were smaller at 6 months compared to 12 months. Thus, except for the tail artery at 6 Hz, the effect of cocaine on responses to adrenergic nerve stimulation did not vary with age. In the tail artery at 6 months, because control responses were significantly smaller, the effect of cocaine was greater than at other ages. These findings suggest that a decrease in NE uptake with advancing age cannot account for the maintenance of adrenergic responses in the face of a fall in tissue NE content.\r"

Pretreatment of cells with 10 microM EPI for 30 min at 37 degrees C resulted in homologous desensitization of BAR-coupled adenylate cyclase activity assayed in membranes and induced internalization or sequestration of BAR. Pretreatment of cells with PMA did not alter BAR-coupled adenylate cyclase activity or induce internalization of BAR. EPI pretreatment caused a 50% decrease in the subsequent ability of EPI to stimulate AAR-mediated incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol, whereas PMA pretreatment inhibited incorporation by 95%. Neither EPI nor PMA induced the internalization of AAR. Neither EPI nor PMA altered agonist binding properties of AAR in short-time competition binding assays on intact cells, indicating that pretreatment of cells with these agents does not alter the affinity of AAR for agonist. In control cells, agonists converted AAR from a form exhibiting predominantly high affinity for agonists, detected in short-time assays, to a form, exhibiting low apparent affinity for agonist during the course of equilibrium competition binding assays. PMA pretreatment increased the extent of this subsequent agonist-induced conversion to the low affinity form. These results indicate that PMA can mimic agonist-induced desensitization of AAR, but not BAR, and that the desensitization of AAR-coupled phosphatidylinositol turnover induced by EPI and by PMA is not due to altered receptor affinity for EPI or due to receptor internalization.\r"

  ".W": "The benzamide U-54494A was compared to U-50488H (a structurally related kappa opioid agonist), phenytoin and phenobarbital in a variety of tests of anticonvulsant and sedative activities. In electroshock convulsion antagonism studies in mice and rats, U-54494A was generally similar to the standards in regard to milligrams of potency, threshold elevation, p.o. activity and duration of action. In contrast to phenytoin and phenobarbital, both U-54494A and U-50488H were effective antagonists of the convulsions induced by the excitatory amino acid agonists (kainic, N-methyl-aspartic and quisqualic acids) and the Ca++ channel agonist (Bay K 8644). They were not, however, effective antagonists of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-related convulsants (bicuculline and pentylenetetrazole), but all four blocked audiogenic convulsions in genetically epileptic mice. U-54494A in contrast to U-50488H lacks the kappa receptor-mediated sedative and analgesic activities but the anticonvulsant properties of both compounds are antagonized by high doses of naltrexone. Further investigations of the mechanism of action of these compounds revealed that both caused a dose-related suppression of post-tetanic repetitive discharge in cats soleus nerve-muscle preparations as measured by an abolition of the obligatory potentiation of soleus muscle contractile tension. On a biochemical level, both U-54494A and U-50488H attenuate the depolarization induced uptake of 45Ca++ into forebrain synaptosomes and block the enhancement of [3H]kainic acid binding induced by CaCl2. Together these results suggest that U-54494A is a unique and selective anticonvulsant agent acting by a Ca++-related mechanism possibly through a subclass of kappa receptors.\r"

In isolated guinea pig trachea and parenchymal lung strips, ICI 198,615 demonstrated competitive antagonism of the contractile activity of LTD4 and LTE4 with pA2 values of 10.1 to 9.5, respectively. The compound also appeared to antagonize the contractile activity of LTC4 in guinea pig trachea; however, in the presence of an inhibitor of the metabolism of LTC4 to LTD4, ICI 198, 615 provided a pKB value of 5.3, indicating weak antagonism at the LTC4 receptor. ICI 198,615 was also a potent antagonist of LTC4 and LTD4 in isolated human bronchi and pulmonary veins with pKa values of 9.75 +/- 0.32 to 9.20 +/- 0.24, respectively. When evaluated for activity on a broad variety of non-LT receptors, the compound displayed a minimal selectivity of 6310 and a maximal selectivity of greater than 125,000 for the LTE4 receptor.

In a conscious guinea pig model, ICI 198,615 provided dose-related antagonism of aerosol LTD4-induced dyspnea when administered p.o., i.v. or by aerosol. The pharmacologic half-lives of ICI 198,615 by these routes of administration were greater than 16 hr, 68 min and 34 min, respectively. In pulmonary mechanics studies in which the effects of i.v. or aerosol administration of LTC4 and LTD4 on pulmonary resistance (Rp) or dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) could be quantitated, ICI 198,615 provided dose-related antagonism when administered p.o., i.d, i.v. or by aerosol. The compound also antagonized LTE4-induced changes in Rp and Cdyn when administered i.v. ICI 198,615 reversed the effect of LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 on Rp, as well as the effect of LTC4 and LTE4 on Cdyn. The compound was less able to reverse the effect of LTD4 on Cdyn. These results indicate that ICI 198,615 possesses an in vivo profile which is consonant with utility in the treatment of allergic diseases.\r"

Induction of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system with phenobarbital is known to enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of phenobarbital enzyme induction on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in the obese and lean Zucker rodent. A preliminary study was performed evaluating the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in both the obese and lean Zucker rats. Data were utilized to calculate appropriate loading doses of acetaminophen during the subsequent hepatotoxicity study. Phenobarbital enzyme-inducing regimens were administered p.o. to achieve similar steady-state phenobarbital plasma concentrations. Control rats received appropriate placebo solutions. Serum hepatic transaminase enzymes and histologic evidence of hepatocellular necrosis were utilized to evaluate hepatic damage after p.o. administration of 1300 mg of acetaminophen to both obese and lean Zucker rats. Obese Zucker control animals had approximately 2.5 times the total hepatic glutathione content compared to their lean control (164.9 +/- 43.2 vs. 65.3 +/- 18.4 mumol/whole liver). Obese Zucker animals receiving only acetaminophen showed a trend toward a reduced incidence of hepatocellular necrosis compared to similarly treated lean littermates. Obese Zucker rodents pretreated with phenobarbital had an even more pronounced resistance to acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular necrosis (P less than .01) when compared to similarly treated lean littermates. Thus, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is reduced in the obese Zucker rat and pretreatment with phenobarbital offers further protection against hepatocellular damage. We suggest that the previously unrecognized increase in hepatic glutathione plays a major role in the resistance of the obese Zucker rat to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.\r"

Under constant flow condition with control coronary perfusion pressure of 71.4 +/- 5.4 mm Hg (mean +/- S.E.M. of eight hearts), infusion of thrombin (0.1 U/ml) resulted in an immediate decrease (-32.8 +/- 2.7 mm Hg) in coronary perfusion pressure, reaching a maximum in approximately 20 to 25 sec. Similar vasodilatory response (-30.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, M +/- S.E.M. of six hearts) also was observed with administration of 0.1 microM acetylcholine. Introduction of 0.3 ml air embolus into the coronary circulation before thrombin or acetylcholine testings, however, showed a 100 and 63% decrease in their respective coronary vasodilatory responses. More importantly, infusion of thrombin into these previously air embolus-treated hearts actually resulted in a potent vasoconstriction by increasing the coronary perfusion pressure (+48.2 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E.M. of six hearts) above the control level. The coronary vasoconstrictory effect of thrombin was reversible upon cessation of thrombin infusion or with concurrent administration of sodium nitroprusside (1 microM). Similarly, synthetic thrombin inhibitor phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 microM) also was capable of both inhibiting and reversing thrombin-induced vasoconstriction. The present finding of a potent thrombin-induced coronary vasoconstriction in intact hearts after air embolus infusion further supports the hypothesis that an activation of thrombin in certain pathological states with injured endothelium may have an important role in the genesis of coronary vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "The influx of 45Ca++ produced by l-norepinephrine (3 X 10(-7) or 10(-5) M) and K+ (100 mM) in rat aorta was not significantly influenced by phenoxybenzamine (1 or 3 X 10(-8) M) present for 5 or 10 min. However, the l-norepinephrine (3 X 10(-7) or 10(-5) M)-mediated 45Ca++ efflux was markedly attenuated by this treatment. Higher concentrations of phenoxybenzamine, as well as extension of the time of exposure, impaired the 45Ca++ influx to l-norepinephrine, but not that to K+. In contrast, prazosin (10(-9)-10(-7) M), as well as N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (10(-7) or 10(-6) M for 5 or 10 min), was equally effective in antagonizing the 45Ca++ in and efflux caused by l-norepinephrine. Exposure of rat aorta to 1.3 X 10(-9) M phenoxybenzamine for 30 min significantly shifted the log concentration-contractile response curve to the full alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, l-phenylephrine, to the right and reduced its maximum response but failed to alter the contraction to the partial agonist Sgd 101/75 (indanidine). Conversely, incubations with 2.0, 2.2 and 3.0 X 10(-8) M N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline invariably affected the contractions to Sgd 101/75 more than those to l-phenylephrine. In pithed rats, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (1 or 2 mg/kg i.v., -30 min), as well as phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mg/kg i.v., -30 min), enhanced the effectiveness of nifedipine to inhibit the vasopressor responses to the alpha-1 adrenoceptor stimulant, cirazoline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concentration-response curves to vasopressin agonists were constructed before and during exposure to 1-beta-mercapto,beta,beta,cyclopentamethylene propionic acid, 2(O-me)tyrosine,-8-D-arginine vasopressin, and at three time points after washing out the antagonist. EC50 values (-log M) for arg-vasopressin (AVP, 8.02 +/- 0.16) and arg-vasotocin (AVT, 9.51 +/- 0.12) were unaltered after exposure to the antagonist and washing of the tissues. The control EC50 for lys-vasopressin (LVP, 8.33 +/- 0.09) was significantly lower than after blockade (P less than .05). At each time point after blockade, the intrinsic activity of LVP was greater than either AVP or AVT. Increasing the ambient magnesium ion concentration greater than 1.2 mM did not alter responses to vasopressin agonists. Reducing the ambient magnesium ion from 1.2 mM to zero increased the EC50 values for all vasopressin agonists by 6- to 20-fold, but had no effect on maximal response size, nor on the concentration-response curve for norepinephrine. Pseudoirreversible blockade performed in the absence of magnesium also increased the EC50 for LVP but not for AVP or AVT after exposure to the antagonist. We conclude that LVP has greater efficacy than AVP and AVT at vasopressin receptors in rat tail artery, and that magnesium ions affect only agonist affinity but not efficacy at this vasopressin-1 receptor.\r"

  ".W": "In voltage-clamped Myxicola giant axons internally and externally applied tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) blocked K+ channels with a dissociation constant of 100 microM and slowed their rate of activation. At a concentration of 10 microM, internal THA primarily slowed inactivation of conducting Na+ channels. At 100 microM the decline of the Na+ current during depolarizing pulses was biphasic, with an initial phase 2 to 3 times faster than in control axons. In the presence of THA there was a steady-state inward current accompanied by an increase in amplitude and time constant of Na+ tail currents, as if THA blocked Na+ channels by first entering them and then rendered THA-occluded channels resistant to fast inactivation. THA did not alter activation, prepulse-induced fast inactivation or slow inactivation. The effects of THA on voltage-dependent axonal ion channels might account for central nervous system hyperexcitability seen in some patients treated with THA. Because THA is a potent, centrally active anticholinesterase, even subtle ion channel-directed effects might contribute to its putative antidementia action in clinical states involving a central nervous system deficiency of acetylcholine by selective augmentation of acetylcholine release and/or negation of autoreceptor effects of endogeneous acetylcholine.\r"

The initial phasic portion of the NE-induced response was either unaffected or only slightly (less than 10%) reduced, but the tonic portion of the response was inhibited completely by higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 300 microM) of Ga . In resting muscles, the equilibrated (90 min) 45Ca uptake was not altered by Ga (360 microM). Also, 45Ca efflux from either high- or low-affinity Ca++ binding sites was unaltered by Ga . The effects of Ga (360 microM) on 45Ca retained after a subsequent 60-min washout at 0.5 degrees C in an isosmotic (80.8 mM) La solution were also examined. High affinity La -resistant 45Ca released by NE (1 microM) was not altered by Ga . Under conditions favoring low affinity Ca++ uptake, 45Ca retention in control and K+-treated muscles was not changed by Ga , but the additional incremental 45Ca uptake associated with NE (in the presence of high K+) was blocked. Thus, Ga appears to have a selective inhibitory action on NE-associated 45Ca uptake without affecting either resting and high K+-induced 45Ca uptake or that 45Ca fraction released by NE. This action may result from a selective blockade by Ga of receptor-linked Ca++ channels in rabbit aortic smooth muscle.\r"

Pretreatment of cells for 1, 5 and 30 min with IPR followed by a 1-min challenge with IPR resulted in 20, 50 and 70% drops in maximum stimulation, respectively, with no significant change in the EC50 value (60 nM). Cells stimulated with IRP in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724 reached intracellular cAMP levels 6 to 8 times higher than controls and maintained these levels for at least 60 min of continuous stimulation. Addition of RO 20-1724 to cells showing a reduced response after exposure to IPR resulted in an immediate and sustained increase of cAMP levels. Because RO 20-1724 nearly completely inhibited cAMP degradation, the authors conclude that the apparent inactivation of IPR-stimulated cAMP response in the LMR55 cells is due mainly to cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase activity.\r"

  ".W": "MCI-154 is a new positive inotropic agent with vasodilating property. Experiments were carried out in the canine isolated right ventricular muscle in order to elucidate whether or not cyclic AMP is involved in the positive inotropic effect (PIE) of MCI-154. MCI-154 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) produced a concentration-dependent PIE amounting to 75% of the maximal effect of isoproterenol. MCI-154 did not affect the time to peak tension and had a tendency to shorten the relaxation time and total duration of contraction. Pindolol, reserpine-pretreatment or tetrodotoxin did not modify the PIE of MCI-154. MCI-154 increased the cyclic AMP levels only at 3 X 10(-4) M, whereas CI-914, of which chemical structure is similar to that of MCI-154, elevated definitely the cyclic AMP at the lower concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-4) M). Carbachol at a concentration known to decrease markedly the PIE of amrinone, milrinone and papaverine, did not affect the PIE of MCI-154. MCI-154 inhibited the activity of a crude phosphodiesterase (PDE) from the canine ventricular muscle and it enhanced the PIE of isoproterenol, which implied the involvement of cyclic AMP. However, the maximal inhibition of PDE by MCI-154 remained less than 18%. Amrinone, milrinone and papaverine inhibited more potently the PDE activity than MCI-154. These results suggest that the elevation of cyclic AMP levels is only partially involved in the PIE of MCI-154 in the canine right ventricular muscle, and that MCI-154 may have novel mechanisms of action different from those of amrinone, milrinone and CI-914 that are largely cyclic AMP-dependent.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoconstrictor effects of Bay k 8644, a dihydropyridine Ca++ agonist, and vasorelaxant effects of nifedipine were investigated in helical strips of dog cerebral (basilar, posterior cerebral and middle cerebral) and peripheral (coronary and mesenteric) arteries. The addition of Bay k 8644 produced a dose-dependent contraction in the absence of any contractile agent in the basilar artery with a pD2 value of 8.53. Similar sensitivity to Bay k 8644 was observed in the posterior cerebral, middle cerebral or coronary artery. Bay k 8644 was much less effective in producing a contraction in the mesenteric artery. An elevation of the concentration of extracellular K+ eliminated the difference between the responses to Bay k 8644 in the basilar and mesenteric artery. Contractile responses of the basilar artery to Bay k 8644 were antagonized competitively by nifedipine (pA2 = 8.17), but non-competitively by diltiazem. The pA2 values for nifedipine antagonism of Bay k 8644 responses with the elevated K+ were the same between the basilar and mesenteric arteries. Increased sensitivity to exogenously added K+ also was observed in cerebral and coronary arteries when compared with the mesenteric artery. The addition of nifedipine to an unstimulated strip produced a dose-dependent relaxation in cerebral and coronary arteries, but not in the mesenteric artery. When the cerebral and peripheral arteries were contracted with K+ to the same magnitude, nifedipine produced similar relaxations among these arteries. Nifedipine was less efficacious in antagonizing the contractile response to Bay k 8644 compared with the contractile response to K+ in cerebral arteries. These results suggest that 1) the voltage-dependent Ca++ channels in the cerebral and coronary arteries are in different states of activation from those in the mesenteric artery, 2) Bay k 8644 contracts the cerebral and coronary arteries by acting primarily on the same site, presumably dihydropyridine receptors of the voltage-dependent Ca++ channels at which nifedipine acts, 3) the dihydropyridine receptors were the same between the basilar and mesenteric arteries and 4) there may be a difference in the state of the Ca++ channel in the arteries between the stimulation with Bay k 8644 and K+-depolarization.\r"
