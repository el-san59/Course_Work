  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Preliminary reports suggest that patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia may benefit from the addition of corticosteroid treatment to antibiotic therapy. METHODS. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in patients with AIDS and severe P. carinii pneumonia. Patients with marked abnormalities in gas exchange who had been treated with antibiotics for less than 72 hours were randomly assigned to receive either methylprednisolone (40 mg) or placebo every 6 hours for 7 days, in addition to treatment for 21 days with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The primary outcome measures were survival until hospital discharge and the development of respiratory failure. RESULTS. Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study; there were no significant differences in base-line clinical or laboratory measures between the two treatment groups. Of 12 patients treated with corticosteroids, 9 (75 percent) survived until hospital discharge, as compared with only 2 of 11 placebo recipients (18 percent) (P less than 0.008). Respiratory failure developed in nine placebo recipients, as compared with only three patients treated with corticosteroids (P less than 0.008). No patient required the interruption or discontinuation of corticosteroid or antibiotic treatment because of toxicity or a complicating event. Because of the marked difference in survival, it was deemed unethical to continue the trial, and the study was terminated. CONCLUSIONS. Early adjunctive corticosteroid therapy can improve survival and decrease the occurrence of respiratory failure in patients with AIDS and severe P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia remains a common cause of serious morbidity and mortality in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The extensive lung injury that accompanies pneumocystis-associated respiratory failure and the reports of clinical benefit from the use of adjunctive corticosteroids provided the rationale for this prospective multicenter trial. METHODS. A total of 333 patients with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia received standard treatment and were randomly assigned to receive either corticosteroids (beginning with the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone twice daily) or no additional therapy. The primary end points in this unblinded trial were the occurrence of respiratory failure (hypoxemia ratio [partial pressure of arterial oxygen divided by fraction of inspired oxygen] less than 75, intubation, or death), death, and dose-limiting toxicity of the initial standard therapy. RESULTS. Of the patients with confirmed or presumed pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 225 and n = 26, respectively), those assigned to treatment with corticosteroids had a lower cumulative risk at 31 days of respiratory failure (0.14 vs. 0.30, P = 0.004) and of death (0.11 vs. 0.23, P = 0.009), as well as a lower risk of death within 84 days (0.16 vs. 0.26, P = 0.026). The frequency of dose-limiting toxicity of the standard therapy was similar in the two treatment groups. Intention-to-treat analyses of the entire cohort confirmed these findings. Clinical benefit could not be demonstrated, however, for patients with mild disease (hypoxemia ratio, greater than 350), equivalent to a partial pressure of oxygen greater than 75 torr on room air. The patients assigned to corticosteroid treatment had an excess of localized herpetic lesions (26 percent vs. 15 percent, P = 0.04) but not of other infections or of neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS. Early adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids reduces the risks of respiratory failure and death in patients with AIDS and moderate-to-severe pneumocystis pneumonia. Because the adverse effects are few, corticosteroids should be included as part of the initial treatment for persons with AIDS who have moderate-to-severe pneumocystis pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The retinoblastoma-susceptibility (Rb) gene is a prototype tumor-suppressor gene originally isolated from patients with heritable retinoblastoma. This gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression is altered in several types of human tumors. METHODS. We studied the expression of the Rb protein in 44 primary and 12 metastatic high-grade human sarcomas by means of immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting. Computerized image analysis was used to quantify the level of Rb gene product in individual tumor cells. The expression of the Rb gene was then correlated with clinical outcome in the patients with primary tumors. RESULTS. Of the 44 patients with primary sarcomas, 13 (30 percent) had tumors with normal, homogeneous expression of the Rb protein in essentially all tumor cells. Thirty-one patients with primary tumors (70 percent) had altered Rb expression; in 18 (40 percent) the Rb protein was heterogeneously expressed, and in 13 (30 percent) it was detected in fewer than 20 percent of the tumor cells. All 12 of the patients with metastatic sarcomas had altered expression of the Rb protein. When the findings in the patients with primary tumors were correlated with clinical outcome, survival was found to be significantly increased in the patients whose tumors had homogeneous Rb expression, as compared with those with either heterogeneous expression (P = 0.026) or no expression (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS. Tumors in which the expression of Rb gene product was decreased were more aggressive than tumors in which this protein was expressed by nearly all cells. The Rb gene product may be an important prognostic variable in patients with these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Isolated deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and plasminogen have been implicated as a cause of deep-vein thrombosis. It is assumed that patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile thrombosis are very likely to have such a deficiency. METHODS. We studied the prevalence of isolated deficiencies of these proteins in 277 consecutive outpatients with venographically proved acute deep-vein thrombosis, as compared with 138 age-matched and sex-matched controls without deep-vein thrombosis, and calculated the positive predictive value of a history of recurrent, familial, or juvenile venous thromboembolism for the presence of such a deficiency. RESULTS. The overall prevalence of deficiencies of any of these proteins in the patients with venous thrombosis was 8.3 percent (23 of 277 patients) (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 12.4), as compared with 2.2 percent in the controls (3 of 138 subjects) (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 6.1; P less than 0.05 for the comparison between groups). The positive predictive values for the presence of an isolated protein deficiency in patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile deep-vein thrombosis, defined as the proportion of patients with the clinical finding who had a deficiency of one or more of the proteins, were 9, 16, and 12 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The cause of acute venous thrombosis in most outpatients (91.7 percent) cannot be explained by abnormalities of coagulation-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins. The information obtained from the medical history concerning recurrent or familial venous thrombosis or the onset of the disease at a young age is not useful for the identification of patients with protein deficiencies.\r"

We therefore studied blood samples from 293 patients with cystic fibrosis for the presence of the most common disease-causing mutation (delta F508) on chromosome 7 and compared the results with the clinical manifestations of the disease. RESULTS. The prevalence of the delta F508 allele in the cohort was 71 percent; 52 percent of the patients were homozygous for the mutation, 40 percent were heterozygous, and 8 percent had other, undefined mutations. The patients who were homozygous for the mutation had received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis at an earlier age and had a greater frequency of pancreatic insufficiency; pancreatic insufficiency was present in 99 percent of the homozygous patients, but in 72 percent of the heterozygous patients and only 36 percent of the patients with other genotypes. The patients with pancreatic insufficiency in all three genotype groups had similar clinical characteristics, reflected by an early age at diagnosis, similar sweat chloride values at diagnosis, similar severity of pulmonary disease, and similar percentiles for weight. In contrast, the patients in the heterozygous-genotype and other-genotype groups who did not have pancreatic insufficiency were older and had milder disease. They had lower sweat chloride values at diagnosis, normal nutritional status, and better pulmonary function after adjustment for age. CONCLUSIONS. The variable clinical course in patients with cystic fibrosis can be attributed at least in part to specific genotypes at the locus of the cystic fibrosis gene.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is a form of hereditary elliptocytosis in which the red cells are rigid and resistant to malaria invasion. The underlying molecular defect is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied the red cells of 54 patients with ovalocytosis and 122 normal controls. We found that ovalocytes contain a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein, the principal transmembrane protein of red cells. The structural lesion of ovalocyte band 3 was revealed by limited proteolytic cleavage of the protein, which produced fragments of abnormal size that were derived from the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. The structural lesion was present in all the subjects with ovalocytosis but none of the controls. This region of band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1. The structural defect is dominantly inherited, being tightly linked with the inheritance of ovalocytosis (the probability of linkage is in excess of 10 million to 1). Ovalocyte band 3 bound considerably more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 protein. This tight binding of ovalocyte band 3 to the underlying skeleton containing ankyrin was directly confirmed in intact cells by the finding that ovalocyte band 3 had markedly reduced lateral mobility in the membrane. CONCLUSIONS. The red cells in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis carry a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein. This molecular defect may underlie the increased rigidity of the red cells and their resistance to invasion by malaria parasites.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. To estimate the magnitude of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic among university students, we conducted a blinded HIV-seroprevalence survey at 19 universities throughout the United States. HIV-antibody testing was performed on blood collected for routine medical purposes at the student health centers of the participating institutions. At each campus, from 250 to 1000 blood specimens were collected consecutively and tested for HIV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. Nonidentifying demographic data were linked with the test results. RESULTS. Of 16,863 specimens in the sample, 30 (0.2 percent) were positive for antibodies to HIV. Positive specimens were found at 9 of the 19 schools. All were from students over 18 years old; 19 (63 percent) were from students over 24. All but 2 of the 30 infected students were men. The seroprevalence rate for men was 0.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.7), and for women it was 0.02 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.066). Seroprevalence increased with age--from 0.08 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.15) for students 18 to 24 years old to 1.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 2.9) for those 40 or older. CONCLUSIONS. HIV infection is present on U.S. university campuses, although the rate appears to be far lower than that of populations known to be at high risk. The potential clearly exists, however, for the further spread of HIV infection in this population, and preventive measures are needed.\r"

  ".U": "91042898\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Bacillary angiomatosis is an infectious disease causing proliferation of small blood vessels in the skin and visceral organs of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and other immunocompromised hosts. The agent is often visualized in tissue sections of lesions with Warthin-Starry staining, but the bacillus has not been successfully cultured or identified. This bacillus may also cause cat scratch disease. METHODS. In attempting to identify this organism, we used the polymerase chain reaction. We used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 16S ribosomal RNA genes of eubacteria to amplify 16S ribosomal gene fragments directly from tissue samples of bacillary angiomatosis. The DNA sequence of these fragments was determined and analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness to other known organisms. Normal tissues were studied in parallel. RESULTS. Tissue from three unrelated patients with bacillary angiomatosis yielded a unique 16S gene sequence. A sequence obtained from a fourth patient with bacillary angiomatosis differed from the sequence found in the other three patients at only 4 of 241 base positions. No related 16S gene fragment was detected in the normal tissues. These 16S sequences associated with bacillary angiomatosis belong to a previously uncharacterized microorganism, most closely related to Rochalimaea quintana. CONCLUSIONS. The cause of bacillary angiomatosis is a previously uncharacterized rickettsia-like organism, closely related to R. quintana. This method for the identification of an uncultured pathogen may be applicable to other infectious diseases of unknown cause.\r"

  ".U": "91042899\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Peliosis hepatis is characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver and is seen in patients with chronic infections or advanced cancer and as a consequence of therapy with anabolic steroids. Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; its histologic appearance is that of a pseudoneoplastic vascular proliferation. METHODS. We studied liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. For comparison we examined tissue from four patients who had peliosis hepatis without HIV infection. Tissues were examined histologically on routine sections and with special stains and electron microscopy. RESULTS. The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis associated with HIV infection, but not in the four cases unrelated to HIV infection, were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy proved to be bacilli. The bacilli, which could not be cultured, were morphologically identical to those found in the skin lesions of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. The clinical courses of two of the patients with this \"bacillary peliosis hepatis\" indicate that it responds to antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-associated bacillary peliosis hepatis is an unusual, treatable opportunistic infection, probably caused by the same organism that causes cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. Our failure to find bacilli in non-HIV-associated cases implies that other pathogenetic mechanisms may also be responsible for peliosis hepatis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We identified a motile, curved, gram-negative bacillus as the cause of persistent fever and bacteremia in two patients with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. The same organism was subsequently recovered from a bone marrow-transplant recipient with septicemia and from two immunocompetent persons with week-long febrile illnesses. All the patients recovered after antimicrobial therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Primary cultures of blood processed by centrifugation after blood-cell lysis yielded adherent, white, iridescent, morphologically heterogeneous colonies in 5 to 15 days. Subcultures grew in four days on chocolate, charcoal-yeast extract, or blood agar. The organisms stained weakly with safranin and were not acid-fast. Fluorescent-antibody tests for legionella and francisella were negative. Biochemical reactivity was minimal and difficult to ascertain. Agar-dilution testing revealed in vitro susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents tested. The cellular fatty acid composition of the isolates was similar, resembling that of Rochalimaea quintana or brucella species, but not Helicobacter pylori or species of campylobacter or legionella. As resolved by gel electrophoresis, cell-membrane preparations of all isolates contained similar proteins, with patterns that differed from that of R. quintana. Patterns of digestion of DNA from all isolates by EcoRV restriction endonuclease were virtually identical and also differed from that of R. quintana. On immunodiffusion, serum from one convalescent patient produced a line of identity with sonicates of all five isolates. CONCLUSIONS. This pathogen may have been unidentified until now because of its slow growth, broad susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, and possible requirement of blood-cell lysis for recovery in culture. It should be sought as a cause of unexplained fever, especially in persons with defective cell-mediated immunity.\r"

  ".U": "91042901\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The maintenance of cellular levels of high-energy phosphates is required for myocardial function and preservation. In animals, severe myocardial ischemia is characterized by the rapid loss of phosphocreatine and a decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP. METHODS. To determine whether ischemic metabolic changes are detectable in humans, we recorded spatially localized phosphorus-31 nuclear-magnetic-resonance (31P NMR) spectra from the anterior myocardium before, during, and after isometric hand-grip exercise. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP in the left ventricular wall when subjects were at rest was 1.72 +/- 0.15 in normal subjects (n = 11) and 1.59 +/- 0.31 in patients with nonischemic heart disease (n = 9), and the ratio did not change during hand-grip exercise in either group. However, in patients with coronary heart disease and ischemia due to severe stenosis (greater than or equal to 70 percent) of the left anterior descending or left main coronary arteries (n = 16), the ratio decreased from 1.45 +/- 0.31 at rest to 0.91 +/- 0.24 during exercise (P less than 0.001) and recovered to 1.27 +/- 0.38 two minutes after exercise. Only three patients with coronary heart disease had clinical symptoms of ischemia during exercise. Repeat exercise testing in five patients after revascularization yielded values of 1.60 +/- 0.20 at rest and 1.62 +/- 0.18 during exercise (P not significant), as compared with 1.51 +/- 0.19 at rest and 1.02 +/- 0.26 during exercise before revascularization (P less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. The decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP during hand-grip exercise in patients with myocardial ischemia reflects a transient imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in myocardium with compromised blood flow. Exercise testing with 31P NMR is a useful method of assessing the effect of ischemia on myocardial metabolism of high-energy phosphates and of monitoring the response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To assess possible differences in physicians' practices with respect to diagnostic imaging, we compared the frequency and costs of imaging examinations as performed by primary physicians who used imaging equipment in their offices (self-referring) and as ordered by physicians who always referred patients to radiologists (radiologist-referring). METHODS. Using a large, private insurance-claims data base, we analyzed 65,517 episodes of outpatient care by 6419 physicians for acute upper respiratory symptoms, pregnancy, low back pain, or (in men) difficulty urinating. The respective imaging procedures studied were chest radiography, obstetrical ultrasonography, radiography of the lumbar spine, and excretory urography, cystography, or ultrasonography. RESULTS. For all four clinical presentations, the self-referring physicians obtained imaging examinations 4.0 to 4.5 times more often than the radiologist-referring physicians (P less than 0.0001 for all four). For chest radiography, obstetrical ultrasonography, and lumbar spine radiography, the self-referring physicians charged significantly more than the radiologists for imaging examinations of similar complexity (P less than 0.0001 for all three). The combination of more frequent imaging and higher charges resulted in mean imaging charges per episode of care that were 4.4 to 7.5 times higher for the self-referring physicians (P less than 0.0001). These results were confirmed in a separate analysis that controlled for the specialty of the physician. CONCLUSIONS. Physicians who do not refer their patients to radiologists for medical imaging use imaging examinations more frequently than do physicians who refer their patients to radiologists, and the charges are usually higher when the imaging is done by the self-referring physician. From our results it is not possible to determine which group of physicians uses imaging more appropriately.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Atrial septal defects have been surgically correctable for more than 30 years. The long-term survival rates among patients treated in the early era of cardiac surgery are poorly documented, but such data are of critical importance to the future medical care, employability, and insurability of these patients. METHODS. To determine the natural history of surgically corrected atrial septal defects, we studied all 123 patients who underwent repair of an isolated defect (ostium secundum or sinus venosus) at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960, 27 to 32 years after the procedure. The follow-up status of all patients was determined by written questionnaires and telephone interviews. Hospital records and death certificates were obtained if interim hospitalization or death had occurred. RESULTS. The overall 30-year actuarial survival rate among survivors of the perioperative period was 74 percent, as compared with 85 percent among controls matched for age and sex. The perioperative mortality was 3.3 percent (four deaths). Actuarial 27-year survival rates among patients in the younger two quartiles according to age at operation (less than or equal to 11 years and 12 to 24 years) were no different from rates among controls--97 percent and 93 percent, respectively. In the two older quartiles (25 to 41 years and greater than 41 years), 27-year survival rates were significantly less (P less than 0.001)--84 percent and 40 percent, respectively--than in controls (91 and 59 percent). Independent predictors of long-term survival according to multivariate analysis were age at operation (P less than 0.0001) and systolic pressure in the main pulmonary artery before operation (P less than 0.0027). When repair was performed in older patients, late cardiac failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were significantly more frequent. CONCLUSIONS. Among patients with surgically repaired atrial septal defects, those operated on before the age of 25 have an excellent prognosis, but older patients require careful, regular supervision.\r"

It has not been clearly established which features of the acute illness predict the chronic neurologic sequelae, including late seizures or epilepsy. METHODS. We followed 185 infants and children prospectively during and after acute bacterial meningitis. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.9 years (range, 0.1 to 15.5). During the first six years standard neurologic examinations were performed; telephone interviews were conducted thereafter. RESULTS. One month after meningitis, 69 children (37 percent) had neurologic abnormalities. Many of these signs resolved within a year, leaving only 26 children (14 percent) with persistent deficits: 18 (10 percent) had only sensorineural hearing loss, and 8 (4 percent) had multiple neurologic deficits. Thirteen children (7 percent) had one or more late seizures not associated with fever. The presence of persistent neurologic deficits indicative of cerebral injury was the only independent predictor of late afebrile seizures (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. After bacterial meningitis only children with permanent neurologic deficits are at high risk for epilepsy. Those with normal examinations after the acute illness have an excellent change of escaping serious neurologic sequelae, including epilepsy.\r"

Previous data on the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis for school-age children have been inconsistent, and much of the information on risk factors has been inconclusive. The present study was designed to evaluate the sequelae of this disease with a protocol for the comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological function. METHODS. Ninety-seven school-age children (mean age, 9.6 years), each of whom had a school-age sibling, were recruited from a survey of the medical records of 519 children treated for H. influenzae type b meningitis between 1972 and 1984 (at a mean age of 17 months) at the children's hospitals of Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. Of the 97 children, 41 had had an acute neurologic complication. Sequelae were assessed by comparing the index children with their nearest siblings on the basis of standardized measures of cognitive, academic, and behavioral status. RESULTS. Only 14 children (14 percent) had persisting neurologic sequelae: sensorineural hearing loss in 11 (unilateral in 6 and bilateral in 5), seizure disorder in 2, and hemiplegia and mental retardation in 1. Although the total sample of index children scored slightly below the siblings in reading ability, the 56 children without acute-phase neurologic complications (58 percent) were indistinguishable from their siblings on all measures. The differences between the groups were small even for the 41 pairs in which the index child had had an acute neurologic complication (mean full-scale IQ, 102 for the index children vs. 109 for the siblings). Sequelae were also associated with lower socioeconomic status and a lower ratio of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid to that in blood at the time of the meningitis. Behavioral problems were more prominent in index boys than index girls and in those who were older at the time of testing, but sex and age were not related to cognitive or academic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS. We find a favorable prognosis for the majority of children who are treated for meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The rates of colon cancer in various countries are strongly correlated with the per capita consumption of red meat and animal fat and, to a lesser degree, inversely associated with the consumption of fiber. METHODS. We conducted a prospective study among 88,751 women 34 to 59 years old and without a history of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or familial polyposis who completed a dietary questionnaire in 1980. By 1986, during 512,488 person-years of follow-up, 150 incident cases of colon cancer had been documented. RESULTS. After adjustment for total energy intake, animal fat was positively associated with the risk of colon cancer (P for trend = 0.01); the relative risk for the highest as compared with the lowest quintile was 1.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.15). No association was found for vegetable fat. The relative risk of colon cancer in women who ate beef, pork, or lamb as a main dish every day was 2.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 5.03), as compared with those reporting consumption less than once a month. Processed meats and liver were also significantly associated with increased risk, whereas fish and chicken without skin were related to decreased risk. The ratio of the intake of red meat to the intake of chicken and fish was particularly strongly associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer (P for trend = 0.0005); the relative risk for women in the highest quintile of this ratio as compared with those in the lowest quintile was 2.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.50 to 4.13). A low intake of fiber from fruits appeared to contribute to the risk of colon cancer, but this relation was not statistically independent of meat intake. CONCLUSIONS.

The number of leukaemia deaths was 58, comparable to the 62 in control areas, and slightly less than the 67 expected from national mortality statistics. Twelve deaths due to Hodgkin's disease were observed around nuclear sites; this is about twice the number of Hodgkin's deaths observed in control areas and twice the number expected from national mortality statistics. This observation must, however, be interpreted in light of the fact that several causes of deaths were studied, increasing the play of chance.\r"

We now report that this growth factor controls the proliferation of neuronal precursors in a defined culture system of cells derived from the early embryonic brain. Neuronal precursor cells were identified by expression of the intermediate filament protein nestin. These cells proliferate in response to nerve growth factor but only after they have been exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor. On withdrawal of nerve growth factor, the proliferative cells differentiate into neurons. Thus, in combination with other growth factors, nerve growth factor regulates the proliferation and terminal differentiation of neuroepithelial stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "Excitatory amino acids mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system through the activation of at least three distinct ionotropic receptors: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (AMPA)/quisqualate (QUIS) and the kainate subtypes (for reviews, see refs 1, 2). They also activate the additional QUIS 'metabotropic' receptor (sensitive to trans-1-amino-cyclopentyl-1,3-dicarboxylate, ACPD) linked to inositol phospholipid metabolism. We have used hippocampal slice cultures to study the electrophysiological consequences of the metabotropic response. We find that activation of an ACPD-sensitive QUIS receptor produces a 'slow' excitation of CA3 pyramidal cells, resulting from depression of a Ca2(+)-dependent K+ current and a voltage-gated K+ current. Combined voltage-clamp and microfluorometric recordings show that, although these receptors can trigger an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, suppression of K+ currents is independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+. These effects closely resemble those induced by activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the same neurons and suggest that excitatory amino acids not only act as fast ionotropic transmitters but also as slow neuromodulatory transmitters.\r"

  ".W": "Nitric oxide (NO), apparently identical to endothelium-derived relaxing factor in blood vessels, is also formed by cytotoxic macrophages, in adrenal gland and in brain tissue, where it mediates the stimulation by glutamate of cyclic GMP formation in the cerebellum. Stimulation of intestinal or anococcygeal nerves liberates NO, and the resultant muscle relaxation is blocked by arginine derivatives that inhibit NO synthesis. It is, however, unclear whether in brain or intestine, NO released following nerve stimulation is formed in neurons, glia, fibroblasts, muscle or blood cells, all of which occur in proximity to neurons and so could account for effects of nerve stimulation on cGMP and muscle tone. We have now localized NO synthase protein immunohistochemically in the rat using antisera to the purified enzyme. We demonstrate NO synthase in the brain to be exclusively associated with discrete neuronal populations. NO synthase is also concentrated in the neural innervation of the posterior pituitary, in autonomic nerve fibres in the retina, in cell bodies and nerve fibres in the myenteric plexus of the intestine, in adrenal medulla, and in vascular endothelial cells. These prominent neural localizations provide the first conclusive evidence for a strong association of NO with neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that persists in the host and can cause severe disease in the immunocompromised individual or in the fetus. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the virus genome has revealed the presence of an open reading frame whose predicted translation product has homology with the heavy chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule of higher eukaryotes, and the observed sequence homology was given additional significance by the independent observation that HCMV virions can bind beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2m), the light chain of the MHC class I molecule. We expressed both the HCMV class I homologue and the human beta 2m gene in recombinant vaccinia viruses. We show that the coexpressed gene products associate, that the transport of beta 2m to the cell surface is dependent on coexpression of the class I homologue and that the viral gene product is therefore functionally related to its cellular counterpart. We observe also that, in HCMV-infected cells, no synthesis of mature cellular class I molecules occurs, while messenger RNA levels remain unaltered, and we speculate that one function of the viral homologue may be to sequester beta 2m, thus preventing the maturation of cellular class I molecules and rendering the infected cell unrecognizable by cytotoxic T cells.\r"

In addition, this polymorphism, which affects 8-10% of the caucasian population, has been associated with altered susceptibility to lung and bladder cancer. Here we report the identification of the primary mutation responsible for this metabolic defect and the development of a simple DNA-based genetic assay to allow both the identification of most individuals at risk of drug side-effects and clarification of the conflicting reports on the association of this polymorphism with cancer susceptibility.\r"

Each gamma-crystallin comprises four topologically equivalent, Greek key motifs; pairs of motifs are organized around a local dyad to give domains and two similar domains are in turn related by a further local dyad. Sequence comparisons and model building predicted that hetero-oligomeric beta-crystallins also had internally quadruplicated subunits, but with extensions at the N and C termini, indicating that beta, gamma-crystallins evolved in two duplication steps from an ancestral protein folded as a Greek key. We report here the X-ray analysis at 2.1 A resolution of beta B2-crystallin homodimer which shows that the connecting peptide is extended and the two domains separated in a way quite unlike gamma-crystallin. Domain interactions analogous to those within monomeric gamma-crystallin are intermolecular and related by a crystallographic dyad in the beta B2-crystallin dimer. This shows how oligomers can evolve by conserving an interface rather than connectivity. A further interaction between dimers suggests a model for more complex aggregates of beta-crystallin in the lens.\r"

  ".U": "91043043\r", 
  ".W": "The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) regulates two signal transduction pathways: the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and tyrosine kinase pathways. Stimulation of T cells with antigen or anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies induces an increase in inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol, the second messengers responsible for the mobilization of cytoplasmic free calcium and activation of protein kinase C-4. The TCR also activates a tyrosine kinase that is not intrinsic to the TCR. The relationship between these two signal transduction pathways and their contribution to later T-cell responses is unclear. Studies using variants of a murine hybridoma suggested that the PtdIns pathway might not be necessary for or be involved in regulating interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. To address the relationship between later T-cell responses and the early biochemical signals, we investigated the ability of a heterologous receptor with defined signal transduction function to induce T-cell activation. The human muscarinic subtype-1 receptor (HM1), which elicits PtdIns metabolism in neuronal cells through a G protein-coupled mechanism, also functionally activates this pathway when expressed in the T-cell line Jurkat-derived host, J-HM1-2.2 (ref.8). We show here that stimulation of HM1 alone induced IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor alpha chain expression. HM1 does not induce the tyrosine kinase pathway, suggesting that this pathway does not directly influence later T cell-activation responses. Instead, our studies indicate that activation of the PtdIns pathway is probably sufficient to induce later T-cell responses.\r"

  ".U": "91043044\r", 
  ".W": "Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are the predominant cell producing HIV-1 in most tissues including the central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, lung and skin; infection is associated with dementia, neuropathy, pneumonitis, and dermatitis respectively. Different HIV-1 isolates vary markedly in their ability to infect mononuclear phagocytes productively. Here we describe molecular clones of a CNS-derived isolate, HIV-1(JR-FL), which can replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of early events after infection indicates that the early phase of viral replication before reverse transcription determines tropism. Genetic mapping of the macrophage-tropic phenotype by construction of recombinant viruses indicates that mononuclear phagocyte infectivity can be determined by a 157-amino-acid region of the gp 120 glycoprotein of HIV-1(JR-FL). Significantly, this region is upstream from the previously defined CD4-binding domain. We propose that at least one determinant for mononuclear phagocyte tropism involves target cell interactions with regions of gp120 distinct from the CD4-binding domain.\r"

Cells from people with this condition are hypersensitive to ultraviolet because of a defect in DNA repair. There are nine genetic complementation groups of XP, groups A-H and a variant. We have cloned the mouse DNA repair gene that complements the defect of group A, the XPAC gene. Here we report molecular cloning of human and mouse XPAC complementary DNAs. Expression of XPAC cDNA confers ultraviolet-resistance on several group A cell lines, but not on lines of other XP groups. Almost all group A lines tested showed abnormality or absence of XPAC messenger RNAs. These results indicate that a defective XPAC gene causes group A XP. The human and mouse XPAC genes are located on chromosome 9q34.1 and chromosome 4C2, respectively. Human XPAC cDNA encodes a protein of 273 amino acids with a zinc-finger motif.\r"

A truncated form of the product of this gene translated in vitro is a DNA-binding protein which interacts specifically with the kappa B binding site found in many inducible genes, including the enhancer in human immunodeficiency virus. This gene is yet another in a growing list of important regulatory molecules whose expression is transcriptionally induced upon cellular activation.\r"

We now show that wild-type Gcn4 requires the TATA element for correct messenger RNA start-site selection, but Gcn4 derivatives with deletions in the activation domain activate HIS4 transcription at the correct mRNA start site (I) in the absence of the TATA element. Gcn4 derivatives that activate TATA-independent transcription show low levels of activation. Similarly, we find that low levels of transcription by Bas1/Bas2 are TATA-independent, whereas high levels are TATA-dependent. These results show that the HIS4 TATA element is required for mRNA start-site selection only under conditions of high-level transcription.\r"

  ".W": "The gfa gene encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein expressed in glial cells. In vitro transcription analysis has shown that the human gfa promoter contains two initiation elements that can independently specify the transcription startpoint. One of the elements is a TATA box 25 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription startpoint; the other is located between 10 and 50 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site. We have now shown by transfection that both elements are required for efficient transcription in cultured cells. A partially purified natural human TATA box-binding factor (TFIID) from HeLa cells gave footprints that extended from upstream of the TATA box through the downstream initiator. Deletion of the downstream initiator inhibited both TFIID binding to the TATA box and transcription in vitro. In contrast to natural human TFIID, clone human and yeast TFIIDs expressed in bacteria gave footprints covering only the TATA box region, although hypersensitive sites were observed in the downstream region. The cloned TFIIDs also showed less dependence than natural human TFIID on the downstream initiator for both TATA box binding and in vitro transcription. These results suggest that natural human TFIID contains an additional component(s) that contribute(s) to stable TFIID binding and effective transcription by interacting with the downstream initiator.\r"

We have found neurons in the cerebral cortex of monkeys that prefer one direction of motion when the disparity of a stimulus corresponds to foreground motion and prefer the opposite direction when the disparity corresponds to background motion. We propose that these neurons contribute a signal about the direction of self-motion.\r"

Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL in the single letter code) in animal cells, His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There is evidence that the ERD2 gene encodes the sorting receptor that recognizes HDEL in yeast; its product is an integral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 (26K) that is not glycosylated. In contrast, Vaux et al. suggest that the mammalian KDEL receptor is a 72K glycoprotein that they detected using an anti-idiotypic antibody approach. If this were so, it would indicate a surprising divergence of the retrieval machinery between yeast and animal cells. We report here that human cells express a protein similar in sequence, size and properties to the ERD2 product, and propose that this protein is the human KDEL receptor.\r"

CD45R+ or RB+ CD4 T cells are potent in graft-versus-host reactions, and interleukin-2 related activities, whereas the CD45R0+ subset responds in vitro to recall antigens and provides help for antibody synthesis. It is unclear whether CD45R subsets derive from separate lineages, or are products of unidirectional or reversible differentiation. We show by transferring CD45R+ or CD45R- allotype-marked CD4 T cells into athymic nude rats that both subsets routinely generate cells of the opposite phenotype with a function that follows phenotype, not parentage. The recent equation of CD45R subsets as maturation stages representing 'naive' and 'memory' T cells is difficult to reconcile with this finding.\r"

  ".W": "Signalling by steroid hormones is mediated by receptor proteins that bind hormonal ligands and regulate the transcription of specific genes. The heat-shock protein hsp90 seems to associate selectively with unliganded receptors (aporeceptors), but it has not been determined whether this interaction affects receptor function in vivo. To address the role of hsp90, we have taken advantage of the capacity of mammalian steroid receptors to function in yeast. We constructed a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which hsp90 expression was regulatable and could be reduced more than 20-fold relative to wild type. At low levels of hsp90, aporeceptors seem to be mostly hsp90-free, yet fail to enhance transcription; on hormone addition, the receptors are activated but with markedly reduced efficiency. Thus hsp90 does not inhibit receptor function solely by steric interference; rather, hsp90 seems to facilitate the subsequent response of the aporeceptor to the hormonal signal. This is the first biological evidence that hsp90 acts in the signal transduction pathway for steroid receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91043072\r", 
  ".W": "In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans six hypodermal cells, the vulval precursor cells, are each competent to generate vulval cells. Normally only the three nearest precursor cells to the uterine anchor cell generate the vulva (22 nuclei), while the three others fuse with the non-specialized hypodermal syncytium (hyp7) surrounding each precursor cell and covering the body. Without an inductive signal from the anchor cell, all six vulval precursor cells fuse with hyp7 and no vulva is formed. But without activity of the vulval determination gene lin-15(+), all six cells undergo vulval divisions whether the anchor cell is present or not. Using mosaic analysis, we demonstrate here that lin-15(+) expression is necessary in cells other than the vulval precursor cells or the anchor cell, most probably in the hyp7 syncytium. We propose that lin-15(+) is active in hyp7 in order to repress an intrinsic vulval program in the precursor cells. The inductive signal from the anchor cell counteracts this repression for three precursor cells, allowing them to generate vulval cells. Such a two-signal (repressor/derepressor) mechanism may operate in other cases of tissue induction.\r"

Following introduction of a construct containing dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) flanking sequences fused to neomycin phosphotransferase, 45% of the colonies contained the planned homologous replacement; this frequency rose to nearly 100% in transfections using low amounts of DNA. Integrative transfection in Leishmania thus resembles that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in giving predominantly homologous events. To facilitate studies of folate metabolism and chemotherapy the sole dhfr-ts copy in a heterozygous deletion line was replaced, yielding lines that were functionally DHFR-TS-. Although most genes are diploid in trypanosomatids, methods exploiting the high frequency of homologous recombination should permit complete replacement of any parasite gene.\r"

The study of these organisms received a recent boost from the development of transient transformation allowing the short-term expression of genes reintroduced into parasites like Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis. We have obtained long-term stable transformants of T. brucei that have acquired the ability to grow in medium containing the drug G418, following the targeted insertion of the bacterial gene for neomycin phosphotransferase (neo(r) gene) into the trypanosome tubulin cluster. Plasmids in which part of the T. brucei tubulin gene cluster has been replaced by the neo(r) gene were used. Targeting efficiency was higher with a linearized than with a circular construct, and with 5 kilobases of tubulin gene cluster than with 0.9 kilobases. With these neo(r) constructs homologous recombination seems to be the preferred route for insertion of exogenous DNA into the trypanosome genome, allowing gene targeting without counter-selection.\r"

In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.\r"

Unidirectional CI between conspecific populations of insects is a well documented phenomenon. Bidirectional CI has, however, only been described in mosquito populations, and recently between closely related species of parasitic wasps, where it is of interest as both an unusual form of reproductive isolation and as a potential means of insect population suppression. Here we report on the first known example of bidirectional CI between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans. Further, we show that defects as early as the first cleavage division are associated with CI. This observation suggests that the cellular basis of CI involves disruption of processes before or during zygote formation and that CI arises from defects in the structure and/or function of the sperm during fertilization.\r"

The activation of these 27-pS dihydropyridine-sensitive channels by repetitive stimulation, such as by increased splanchnic nerve activity, can lead to an almost twofold increase in Ca2+ current in these cells. This increase in Ca2+ current is of probable physiological importance in stimulating rapid catecholamine secretion in response to danger or stress. We have identified D1 dopaminergic receptors on bovine chromaffin cells by fluorescence microscopy. Here we show that stimulation of the D1 receptors activates the facilitation Ca2+ currents in the absence of pre-depolarizations or repetitive activity, and that activation by D1 agonists is mediated by cyclic AMP and protein kinase A. The recruitment of facilitation Ca2+ channels by dopamine may form the basis of a positive feedback loop mechanism for catecholamine secretion.\r"

Only 1% of individuals infected with HTLV-I develop clinical disease however. The various manifestations of an HTLV-I infection may be related to differences in the genetic backgrounds of individuals, infection with variant strains of HTLV-I, differences in viral tropism or host immune response to the virus. Whereas the humoral response to HTLV-I is well characterized, little is known about the human cellular immune response, such as the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we report the presence of high levels of circulating HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease but not in HTLV-I seropositive individuals without neurological involvement. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes are CD8+, HLA class I- restricted and predominantly recognize the HTLV-I gene products encoded in the regulatory region pX. These findings suggest that HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of associated neurological disorders associated with HTLV-I.\r"

Until now, this notion has relied on overwhelming but indirect evidence, as the existence of naturally processed viral peptides has not been previously reported. Here we show that such peptides can be extracted from virus-infected cells by acid elution. Both the naturally processed H-2-Db-restricted and H-2-Kd-restricted peptides from influenza nucleoprotein are smaller than the corresponding synthetic peptides, which have first been used to determine the respective CTL epitopes. As with minor histocompatibility antigens, occurrence of viral peptides seems to be heavily dependent on MHC class I molecules, because infected H-2d cells do not contain the H-2-Db-restricted peptide, and infected H-2b cells do not contain the H-2-Kd-restricted peptide. Our data provide direct experimental proof for the above notion on MHC-associated viral peptides on virus-infected cells.\r"

Furthermore, as antigen and anti-idiotypes can competitively bind to idiotype-positive, antigen-specific antibodies, anti-idiotypes may carry an 'internal image' of the external antigen. Here we describe the structure of the complex between the monoclonal anti-lysozyme FabD1.3 and the anti-idiotopic FabE225 at 2.5 A resolution. This complex defines a private idiotope consisting of 13 amino-acid residues, mainly from the complementarity-determining regions of D1.3. Seven of these residues make contacts with the antigen, indicating a significant overlap between idiotope and antigen-combining site. Idiotopic mimicry of the external antigen is not achieved at the molecular level in this example.\r"

  ".W": "During the development of the nervous system, cells require growth factors that regulate their division and survival. To identify new growth factors, serum-free growth-conditioned media from many clonal cell lines were screened for the presence of mitogens for central nervous system glial cells. A cell line secreting a potent glial mitogen was established from a tumour (or 'schwannoma') derived from the sheath of the sciatic nerve. The cells of the tumour, named JS1 cells, were adapted to clonal culture and identified as Schwann cells. Schwann cells secrete an autocrine mitogen and human schwannoma extracts have mitogenic activity on glial cells. Until now, neither mitogen has been purified. Here we report the purification and characterization of a mitogenic molecule, designated schwannoma-derived growth factor (SDGF), from the growth-conditioned medium of the JS1 Schwann cell line. SDGF belongs to the epidermal growth factor family, and is an autocrine growth factor as well as a mitogen for astrocytes, Schwann cells and fibroblasts.\r"

Whether tension is transferred to the channel through the lipid bilayer and/or underlying cytoskeleton is not clear. Using the patch-clamp method, we found that amphipathic compounds, which are molecules having hydrophobic and hydrophilic character with positive, negative or no net electric charge at pH 7, could slowly activate the mechanosensitive channels of giant Escherichia coli spheroplasts, with effectiveness proportional to their lipid solubility. The cationic or anionic amphipaths were able to compensate for each other's effect. After a channel was activated by an amphipath of one charge, if that amphipath was gradually replaced by one with the opposite charge, the channel first inactivated before reactivating. These findings support the view that the mechanical gating force can come from the surrounding lipids.\r"

  ".U": "91043097\r", 
  ".W": "Phage T4 lysozyme consists of two domains between which is formed the active-site cleft of the enzyme. The crystallographically determined thermal displacement parameters for the protein suggested that the amino terminal of the two domains undergoes 'hinge-bending' motion about an axis passing through the waist of the molecule. Such conformational mobility may be important in allowing access of substrates to the active site of the enzyme. We report here a crystallographic study of a mutant T4 lysozyme which demonstrates further the conformational flexibility of the protein. A mutant form of the enzyme with a methionine residue (Met 6) replaced by isoleucine crystallizes with four independent molecules in the crystal lattice. These four molecules have distinctly different conformations. The mutant protein can also crystallize in standard form with a structure very similar to the wild-type protein. Thus the mutant protein can adopt five different crystal conformations. The isoleucine for methionine substitution at the intersection of the two domains of T4 lysozyme apparently enhances the hinge-bending motion presumed to occur in the wild-type protein, without significantly affecting the catalytic activity or thermal stability of the protein.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive duplex scanning of carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque was performed in 286 consecutive patients referred to a cerebrovascular diagnostic laboratory. The presence and thickness of such plaque in the region of the carotid bifurcation were examined for association with the degree of vessel stenosis, age, sex, smoking history, history of prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, and systemic manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. Atherosclerotic plaque thickness was positively correlated with degree of vessel stenosis (P less than 0.0001). Both parameters were independent predictors of cerebrovascular events but plaque thickness was a better predictor of prior transient ischemic attacks (P less than 0.05), and vessel stenosis was a better predictor of prior stroke (P less than 0.005). Patient age (P less than 0.001) and pack-years of cigarette use (P less than 0.001) were independent positive predictors of carotid atherosclerotic plaque thickness. The greatest effect of smoking and atherosclerotic plaque thickness was seen in heavy smokers younger than age 55. Both carotid artery plaque thickness and pack-years of smoking were significant independent predictors of other systemic manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (P less than 0.05). Such noninvasive scanning of carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque demonstrates the significant role of age and smoking in the progression of disease. It also suggests a significant role for carotid atherosclerotic artery plaque in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular events, especially transient ischemic attacks, even prior to the production of a flow-limiting stenosis. Finally, noninvasive screening of carotid artery plaque may provide a useful marker for the patient at risk for systemic atherosclerotic disease and identify the patient for whom maximal atherosclerotic risk factor modification is needed.\r"

  ".U": "91043410\r", 
  ".W": "A new animal model for vasospasm using rat femoral artery has been developed. Whole blood, washed erythrocytes, or leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma were selectively applied to the adventitial surface of the femoral artery for 7 days in 15 rats, after which the vessels were perfusion-fixed and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. As compared with matched control arteries, there was a prominent reduction in luminal cross-sectional area after 7 days in vessels exposed to whole blood or washed erythrocytes, but not in those exposed to leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma. In arteries with luminal narrowing, light and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated marked morphological changes throughout the vessel wall similar to those seen in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Immunohistochemistry disclosed a prominent loss of immunoreactive actin in smooth muscle cells of arteries exposed to whole blood or erythrocytes. To assess the time course of arterial narrowing in this model, whole blood was selectively applied to the adventitial surface of femoral arteries in 23 rats for periods from 2 to 20 days. As compared with control arteries, arterial narrowing was variably present at 2 days, progressively increased by 5 days, was maximal at 7 to 10 days, and returned to near control levels by 20 days. The presence and severity of ultrastructural changes in vessel wall corresponded to the degree of arterial narrowing over time. These results suggest that chronic narrowing in rat femoral artery exposed to periadventitial blood is analogous to that observed in cerebral arterial vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This new model represents a simple and reliable means to investigate pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapies for vasospasm.\r"

This experiment was performed to determine whether endothelin plays a physiological role in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cisternal injection of endothelin (10(-8) mol or 10(-9) mol) caused severe vasoconstriction of the canine basilar artery. The degree of vasoconstriction was dose related and long lasting, persisting for more than 24 hours. This constriction was prevented completely by pretreatment with nicardipine (10(-8) mol). Endothelin produced a marked and transient elevation in blood pressure and might play an important role in cerebral vasospasm. Further investigation will be needed to determine the role of endothelin in the pathogenesis of vasospasm.\r"

To assess the temporal nature of autoregulation, transcranial Doppler velocity recordings of the middle cerebral artery obtained over prolonged periods were compared with blood pressure recordings in 5 patients without cerebral disease and in 13 patients with intracranial pathological changes. Correlations between the velocity and pressure wave forms at various frequencies of variation were measured with systems analysis techniques. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage had high correlations indicating pressure-dependent flow and impaired autoregulation. Patients without cerebral disease had significantly lower correlations (P less than 0.01), indicating intact autoregulation. Examples of increasing correlations and correlations at new frequencies emerging as the clinical condition worsened are given. These preliminary examples suggest that the application of systems analysis techniques to velocity and pressure data allow measurement of the temporal nature of cerebral autoregulation.\r"

After SAH, the ICP was slightly elevated, and there was a decrease in the buffering capacity of the intracranial space and a sharp rise in outflow resistance. During infusion of blood into the cisterna magna with a constant infusion rate, an extensive increase in ICP could be demonstrated in contrast to the infusion of saline, which caused only slight elevation of ICP. Furthermore, during blood infusion, the ICP level did not reach a plateau phase of pressure, as was demonstrated during infusion of saline. It is suggested that the marked increase in ICP during blood infusion into the subarachnoid space is caused by intracranial volume loading and the simultaneous increase in cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance. It is concluded that the reported relationship between increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and increased ICP supports the hypothesis of a strong increase in ICP during subarachnoid hemorrhage in human subjects.\r"

Serial standard neurodiagnostic tests (neurological examination, computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic scan of cerebral blood flow, somatosensory and brain stem evoked potentials, and myelin basic protein levels of cerebrospinal fluid) were compared with preoperative studies. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the development of a lesion at the target site between 45 and 60 days after irradiation. Deterioration of the brain stem evoked potentials preceded imaging changes when the lesion encroached on auditory pathways. Myelin basic protein levels increased subsequent to imaging changes. Postmortem neuropathological examination confirmed a well-demarcated radionecrosis of the target volume. The baboon model appears to be an excellent method to study the in vivo biological effects of radiosurgery.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation attempts to determine whether increased survival time seen when the F98 glioma model is treated with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a result of inhibition of tumor growth caused by radiation-induced alterations in endothelial cells and normal tissue components. This indirect effect of radiation has been called the tumor bed effect. A series of tumor-bearing rats was studied, using a standardized investigational BNCT protocol consisting of 50 mg/kg of Na2B12H11SH injected intravenously 14 to 17 hours before neutron irradiation at 4 x 10(12) n/cm2. Ten rats, serving as controls, received no treatment either before or after tumor implantation. A second group of 10 rats was treated with BNCT 4 days before tumor implantation; these animals received no further treatment. The remaining group of 10 rats received no pretreatment but was treated with BNCT 10 days after implantation. Histological and ultrastructural analyses were performed in 2 animals from each group 17 days after implantation. Survival times of the untreated control animals (mean, 25.8 days) did not differ statistically from the survival times of the rats in the pretreated group (mean, 25.5 days). The rats treated with BNCT after implantation survived significantly longer (P less than 0.02; mean, 33.2 days) than the controls and the preirradiated animals. Tumor size indices calculated from measurements taken at the time of death were similar in all groups. These results indicate that, with this tumor model, BNCT does not cause a tumor bed effect in cerebral tissue. The therapeutic gains observed with BNCT result from direct effects on tumor cells or on the peritumoral neovascularity.\r"

Karyotypic analysis revealed this cell line to be of human origin and near-diploid, with a modal chromosome number of 49. The mesenchymal tumor marker vimentin and intracytoplasmic microfilaments were identified in the cytoplasm of tumor cells by indirect immunohistochemical peroxidase-anti-peroxidase assays and immunogold ultrastructural localization by transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy of cultured cells and xenografted tumors revealed ellipsoidal or carrot-shaped tumor cells presenting a wrinkled surface with short sparse microvilli. Potential proliferating activity was determined by Ki-67 monoclonal antibody; the Ki-67 labeling index of cultured cells and xenografted tumors was approximately 36% and 30%, respectively. This newly established malignant meningioma cell line of the human brain may prove useful as a research model.\r"

Causes included entrapment at the arcade of Froshe (14 patients), laceration (6 patients), fracture (6 patients), compression or contusion (3 patients), and loss associated with tumor (3 patients). The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the right arm was involved twice as often as the left. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, electrophysiological testing (electromyogram/nerve conduction velocity), and roentgenograms of the elbow and forearm. Of the 30 patients (2 patients had bilateral lesions), 26 underwent operation. In the operative series, all 28 nerves had a function of Grade 3 or more of a possible 5 after 4 years of follow-up. Seventeen had achieved Grade 4/5, and 7 had obtained Grade 5/5. At operation, 23 nerves were found to be in continuity. Fourteen lesions of nerves in continuity were associated with entrapment and, not unexpectedly, transmitted a nerve action potential with slowed conduction and low amplitude across the lesion. Four nerves in continuity that had lesions caused by injury had nerve action potentials and were treated by neurolysis, and another 4 had no nerve action potentials and were treated by graft or suture repair. Five injured nerves were not in continuity. Two could be repaired by end-to-end suture, and 3 required graft repair. A large ganglion cyst involving the posterior interosseous nerve was also resected.\r"

In such cases we have, if possible, sutured the nerve stumps microsurgically, either end to end or by use of an intervening nerve graft. We analyzed the outcome of 25 instances of facial nerve suturing in a series of 219 patients operated on for acoustic neurinoma from 1979 to 1987. The first signs of recovery appeared at an average of 12 months, and there was continued improvement for several years. Recovery was graded from 1 to 6. The anastomosis was successful in 24 of the 25 sutured nerves, in that at least some facial movement and tone were restored (Grade 5 or higher). In 11 of the 25 cases, facial appearance at rest and with movement was moderately good (Grade 2 or 3). A Grade 1 result, with no perceivable facial dysfunction, was never achieved. Typically, oral muscles showed the most improvement and frontal muscles the least. Facial appearance was better at rest than with movement, which was always complicated by some degree of synkinesis. Closure of the eye was so good in 13 of the 25 cases that neither tarsorrhaphy nor an eyelid spring was necessary. When the facial nerve is severed, intraoperative suture is recommended, because it provides a chance for moderately good restoration of facial appearance.\r"

  ".W": "Although neurosurgeons have traditionally preferred intracranial repair for the management of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, this approach is associated with the complications of a craniotomy, anosmia, and a high incidence of recurrent fistulas. Extracranial repair, on the other hand, produces no central nervous system morbidity, preserves olfaction, and is associated with a low incidence of recurrence. Although there have been several reports of extracranial repair of CSF fistulas by otorhinolaryngologists, this approach has received scant mention in the neurosurgical literature. We report here our experience with 37 patients with CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea who underwent extracranial repair. The etiology of the fistula was postoperative in 22, traumatic in 6, and spontaneous in 9. The fistulas were repaired using one of four techniques: external ethmoid-sphenoid in 18 patients, transmastoid in 9, transseptosphenoid in 7, and osteoplastic frontal sinusotomy in 3. In 32 of the 37 patients (86%) the fistulas were successfully repaired with the initial procedure. Of the 5 patients requiring a second operation, the fistula was successfully closed in 4 for an overall success rate of 97%. Complications were few and consisted of a transient facial paresis in a patient undergoing transmastoid repair and one death from meningitis. The authors conclude that because of low morbidity and mortality and a high success rate in closing fistulas, extracranial repair is the preferred technique for the operative management of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Inconsistencies across studies concerning outcome after mild head injury may reflect differences in the diagnostic criteria used for selection of patients. Consequently, we compared the neurobehavioral outcome in three groups of consecutively hospitalized patients (aged 16 to 50 years) who sustained a closed head injury (CHI) and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in the 9 to 15 range. These groups included patients with uncomplicated CHI with mild impairment of consciousness as reflected by a GCS score in the 13 to 15 range (n = 78), patients with initially mild impairment of consciousness complicated by brain lesion or depressed skull fracture (n = 77), and patients with moderate CHI (n = 60). Tests of memory, information processing, and verbal fluency were administered within 1 to 3 months after injury, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale was completed at 6 months. Neurobehavioral functioning was impaired in the groups with complicated mild CHI and moderate CHI as compared to the group with uncomplicated mild CHI. Although moderate CHI produced longer durations of impaired consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia than complicated mild head injury, patients in these groups did not differ in neurobehavioral performance. Global outcome at 6 months was better in the patients with mild CHI than in patients with complicated mild and moderate injuries. Analysis of the various complications of mild CHI revealed that the presence of an intracranial lesion was related to more severe neurobehavioral sequelae than injuries complicated by a depressed fracture.\r"

We have produced acute subdural hematoma in the rat by injecting 400 microliters of autologous blood (approximately 20% of intracranial volume) into the subdural space. Extensive areas of ischemic damage, involving 14 to 16% of the volume of the hemisphere, developed in this model at 4 and 24 hours after the lesion. The hematomas were associated with a brief peak in intracranial pressure (51 mm Hg), which remained at three times normal levels (14 mm Hg) for 3 hours. In this model, therefore, ischemic damage appears to be due to the local effects of blood overlying the cortex at 4 hours after the ictus, rather than to globally raised intracranial pressure. The implications for the pathophysiology of acute subdural hematomas in humans are discussed.\r"

One patient treated with only radiation therapy died within 3 months of admission as a result of intraperitoneal metastasis via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Another patient, treated with radiation therapy and intrathecal administration of neocarzinostatin, died after 12 months because of tumor progression and subarachnoid dissemination. Two patients who received radiation and combination therapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin died after 13 and 25 months. The remaining two patients treated with radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) are now alive without recurrence after 16 and 19 months from admission. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide appears to be efficacious in the treatment of intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumor.\r"

MRI was useful in localizing the vascular malformation and delineating its characteristics, especially chronic hemorrhage. One patient underwent biopsy of the lesion. The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized. The MRI scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and following these lesions. In certain patients, these vascular malformations may be amenable to complete surgical removal with stabilization or improvement of visual function.\r"

There was no evidence of hemangioma or dyschromia, and the condition was diagnosed as Ollier's disease, a special type of dyschondroplasia like Maffucci's syndrome and Kast's disease. An increased overall risk for development of malignant skeletal and nonskeletal tumors is associated with Maffucci's syndrome. The risk of malignant degeneration is lower in Ollier's disease. A glioma in the pons and the right lobe of the cerebellum was found in this patient. The literature describes an association with gliomas in only 12 cases of dyschondroplasia and an infratentorial localization in just one case. Signs of malignancy were histologically confirmed in 7 cases without significant preponderance of any one type. Our patient had a low-grade brain stem astrocytoma with fibrillar and gemistocytic components. A stereotactic serial biopsy made it possible to rule out malignant degeneration. Stereotactic brain tumor biopsy as a routine neurosurgical procedure is particularly valuable for deep space-occupying processes and forms the basis for therapy. In the present case, irradiation was not recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Although the spread of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme to the brain stem and spine has been extensively described in published autopsy series, information on the diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent clinical course of patients manifesting symptoms of glioblastomatous dissemination ante mortem remains scant. We report a series of 11 patients having the signs and symptoms of neuraxis dissemination of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. All patients had radiographic documentation of metastases by either contrast-enhanced myelograms or enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans. Ten presented with spinal involvement, whereas one presented with lower cranial neuropathies secondary to diffuse involvement of the basal cisterns. The mean age of the patients was 38.5 years, and the mean time interval between diagnosis of intracranial disease and diagnosis of metastases was 14.1 months. After diagnosis of tumor spread, subsequent mean survival time was 2.8 months. All patients received additional radiotherapy to the areas of metastasis, but the clinical response to radiotherapy was quite poor. This study confirms previous reports in the literature suggesting that metastases occur in younger patients and in patients with extended survival. The findings suggest that the relatively infrequent clinical incidence of the symptomatic spread of glioblastoma multiforme, as compared with the frequent incidental discovery of such spread at autopsy, may be the result of the limited survival of the affected patients, and not due to the biology of the tumor.\r"

We studied the ultrastructural morphology of a human glioblastoma cell line cultured with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, a cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor. When glioblastoma cells were treated for 3 days with antiproliferative concentrations of either agent, they shared many morphological characteristics, including evidence for increased astrocytic differentiation with only limited signs of toxicity. The inhibited glioma cells demonstrated an increase in the number and length of astrocytic processes containing greater numbers of glial filaments, and the NDGA-treated cells also demonstrated extensive lateral pseudopod formation along the processes. The glioblastoma cell shape also became more elongated, losing the usual nuclear lobularity and nuclear inclusions, especially in NDGA-treated cells. Many cytoplasmic organelles packed the cytosol of the inhibited glioma cells, including prominent Golgi apparatus, dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum evolving into dilated vesicles, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and numerous concentric laminations. There was limited evidence for toxicity, however, as the mitochondria were more pleomorphic with some mitochondrial distention and disruption of the cristae along with an increase in cytoplasmic vacuolization. We conclude that the inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis, NDGA and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, not only suppress glioblastoma cell proliferation, but also induce increased astrocytic differentiation.\r"

As opposed to standard techniques that stimulate and divide the dorsal rootlets from L2 to S1, we dissected L4, L5, and S1 dorsal roots through an L5 to S1 laminectomy. Eight to 12 rootlets from each root were electrically stimulated with two unipolar electrodes (pulse width, 50 microseconds; 10-50 V). The muscle responses were observed visually and registered by electromyography. Those rootlets associated with an abnormal motor response as evidenced by sustained muscular contraction or by prolonged electromyographic response were divided. Spasticity was scored from 0 to +. The muscular groups assessed were those involved in the flexion of the shoulder, elbow and wrist in the upper limbs, and those involved in flexion and adduction of the hip, flexion of the leg, and plantar flexion in the lower limbs. The patients were assessed 1 week before and 6 months after the operation. Reduction of spasticity was observed in all the muscular groups, and all the patients presented functional improvement of motor abilities. These preliminary results indicate that a limited procedure that reduces the extension of the laminectomy and the length of the operation could be effective for treating spasticity secondary to infantile cerebral palsy.\r"

  ".W": "We report our experience in the surgical treatment of sagittal synostosis using radical osteoclastic craniectomy in 60 consecutive patients. After surgery in children aged 6 months or younger (Group I), reossification usually started 2 weeks postoperatively and was complete within 6 months, resulting in an optimal skull contour. In children aged 7 to 12 months (Group II), reossification was prolonged and lasted for 12 months or longer. The skull contour normalized in its biparietal width and improved in sagittal diameter, remaining, however, slightly abnormal. In children older than 12 months (Group III), the skull contour partly improved in the biparietal diameter but did not change in the sagittal direction. Reossification was incomplete with persistent pseudosutures. Enlarged frontal subarachnoid spaces were reversible or improved in all patients independent of age at the time of surgery. We encountered no complications in our series. In our opinion, radical osteoclastic craniectomy is the simplest, most efficient, and most physiologically sound method for the treatment of sagittal synostosis in patients up to 6 months of age. This procedure allows the rapidly growing brain to form its skull vault, thus providing optimal cosmetic results. In older children, osteoplastic morcellation procedures should be the treatment of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional echocardiography complemented with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a vein of Galen malformation who had severe high-output congestive heart failure and cranial bruits at birth. Intracranial blood flow through the vein of Galen malformations, cardiac status, and direction of aortic blood flow were assessed before and after staged interventional neuroradiological treatment with transarterial and transvenous embolization procedures. Color-flow imaging in each infant displayed the major vascular anatomy including feeding vessels and the patterns of filling of the vein of Galen malformations. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound performed on the descending aorta above the diaphragm showed the degree of diastolic flow reversal indicative of runoff into the vein of Galen malformations. A reduction in blood flow through the vein of Galen malformation was seen on color-flow imaging in four patients treated successfully by embolic procedures. The ratio of diastolic retrograde flow velocity in the descending aorta to systolic antegrade velocity decreased from 0.51 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 0.15 +/- 0.20 (P less than 0.05). Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with vein of Galen malformations.\r"

Using a rabbit model, we produced coagulopathy by injecting autologous spinal cord and extracted thromboplastin intravenously. Serial coagulation panels were performed to evaluate the activation of the thrombotic and fibrinolytic pathways. Group 1 animals (n = 4) received intravenous injections of homogenized spinal cord tissue. Coagulopathy was not produced with 36 mg of homogenized spinal cord tissue, but 50 mg or more resulted in death. Group 2 animals (n = 12) received intravenous injections of extracted rabbit cord thromboplastin, which contained approximately 60% activity of a commercially purified rabbit brain thromboplastin. Five animals receiving 2.5 to 5.5 mg of thromboplastin per kilogram of body weight survived with evidence of coagulopathy. Seven animals receiving 2.5 to 100 mg of thromboplastin per kilogram of body weight died. Group 3 (4 control animals) received normal saline injections without changes in clinical or laboratory status. The thrombotic pathway was activated in all animals as evidenced by decreased platelet counts and fibrinogen levels. Activation of the fibrinolytic system was demonstrated by increased concentrations of protamine sulfate and abnormal euglobulin clot lysis times. The most sensitive parameters were the platelet count, protamine sulfate concentration, and white cell count (margination), which became abnormal within 15 minutes after the injections and returned to normal within 1 hour.\r"

Five patients had only headache and minimal or no brain shift on a CT scan. The other five had hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance in addition to headache and moderate or severe brain shift on a CT scan. The mean hemispheric CBF decreased about 7% in patients with headache and about 35% in patients with hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance. It decreased also on the side without the hematoma. The CBF reduction was always more pronounced in the putamen and thalamus than in the cortex. On the contrary, the cortex CBF was mostly preserved or even elevated in both groups of patients. We speculate that CBF reduction in patients with a chronic subdural hematoma occurs initially in central cerebral areas like the basal ganglia and thalamus, and then extends to the entire hemisphere including the cortex as brain compression and displacement progress. Central cerebral area involvement might be more responsible for clinical symptoms than the cortex.\r"

  ".U": "91043451\r", 
  ".W": "A study was undertaken to determine how frequently angiographic vasospasm occurs outside the normal access range of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in patients who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vasospasm located in the basal vessels is readily identifiable using transcranial Doppler ultrasound whereas spasm affecting the more distal, vertically oriented arteries is outside the standard detection range. It is therefore speculated that the sensitivity of the technique would be adversely affected by a high incidence of distal vasospasm. A total of 136 angiograms performed on 68 patients after a subarachnoid hemorrhage from anterior circulation aneurysms were reviewed to determine the typical distribution of vasospasm. Of the 40 cases that showed greater than or equal to 25% vessel narrowing, 50.0% had spasm restricted to the basal vessels, 42.5% had spasm involving both basal and distal segments, and 7.5% had spasm of the distal segments only. None of the patients with distal vasospasm alone developed delayed ischemic deficits. It is concluded that most patients with anterior circulation aneurysms who develop vasospasm will have involvement of the basal vessels, but a small number of patients may develop vasospasm only in distal vessels.\r"

Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005).\r"

  ".W": "Using a morphometric technique, the pharmacological reversibility of luminal narrowing after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was investigated. For vasodilation, a \"cocktail\" consisting of 10(-4) M papaverine, 2 x 10(-4) M sodium nitroprusside, and 10(-5) M adenosine was administered intra-arterially. Forty-two rabbits were divided into six groups: control (normal animals); control plus cocktail (normal animals perfused with the cocktail before fixation); SAH (animals sacrificed 48 hours subsequent to intracisternal injection of 1.5 ml/kg of arterial blood); SAH plus cocktail (SAH plus perfusion with the cocktail); BaCl2 (animals sacrificed 10 minutes after intracisternal injection of 2 ml of 3 x 10(-3) M BaCl2); and BaCl2 plus cocktail (BaCl2 animals perfused with the cocktail). The diameter of the basilar arteries in the control and the control plus cocktail groups was not significantly different. BaCl2 reduced the diameter 44% and SAH reduced the diameter 27%. There were no significant differences between the diameter of the BaCl2 plus cocktail group and SAH plus cocktail group when compared with the control or the control plus cocktail group. Morphological examination by light and transmission electron microscopy showed luminal narrowing and corrugation of the elastic lamina with few degenerative or proliferative changes of the vessel wall in animals with SAH. These results suggest that cerebral vasospasm is caused initially by smooth muscle contraction rather than by proliferative vasculopathy and that it is not an irreversible process.\r"

These nerves were conspicuously enhanced after intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid. The preserved facial nerves were also markedly enhanced postoperatively. As a possible cause of these findings, we suggest operative disruption of the blood-nerve barrier with ensuing nerve edema, although the operative procedures were carefully carried out using a surgical microscope. The clinical significance of traumatic disruption of the blood-nerve barrier and subsequent nerve edema are discussed from the standpoint of preservation of cochlear nerve function.\r"

These fractures were divided pathologically into three types based upon their appearance on computed tomography: longitudinal, transverse, and oblique. The mechanisms of injury were similar in all groups, and the Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission were comparable, regardless of fracture type, in survivors and nonsurvivors. Longitudinal fractures were associated with severe injury to the central nervous system and with brain stem infarction, and 4 of 6 (67%) of these patients died. Transverse fractures of the clival complex were found in 6 patients, 3 of whom (50%) died. All of these patients had fractures of the petrous ridge; 2 of the 3 survivors had multiple cranial nerve deficits, and one patient developed a carotid-cavernous fistula. Of the 5 patients with oblique clival fractures, 2 survived (40%), both of whom had multiple cranial nerve palsies; in addition, one of these patients developed a carotid-cavernous fistula. Using the present generation of computed tomographic scanners, fractures of the clival complex can be reliably diagnosed; they are probably more common than previously believed and can be separated into three groups based on the characteristics on computed tomographic scans and clinical findings.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the dosage and timing of administration of naloxone after spinal cord injury in rats via the ventral compression technique is presented. The rat ventral compression technique allows for a ventral compression of the spinal cord without the requirement of a previous laminectomy. It therefore facilitates the creation of an experimental lesion that is similar to that observed in the human clinicopathological situation. The first part of the two-part study presented herein involved the determination of the optimal dose of naloxone, administered intraperitoneally 45 minutes after the creation of the lesion. Of the groups studied (control group through 10.0 mg/kg group), 2.0 mg/kg of naloxone proved to be superior to both lesser and greater dosages. The second part of the study involved the administration of a 2.0 mg/kg dose of naloxone at varying intervals ranging from 10 minutes before lesioning to 24 hours after lesioning. A multiphasic response was again demonstrated, with an optimal time of administration occurring 45 minutes after the creation of the lesion. A significant effect was offered by a midrange dose of naloxone (2.0 mg/kg), administered at 45 minutes after injury (P less than 0.02 by analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test). These findings are discussed with respect to recent evidence regarding the effects of narcotic antagonists on both mu and kappa narcotic receptors. Past and future experiments must account for these responses to multiphasic dosage and timing of administration. Failure to do so may lead to erroneous conclusions.\r"

Early in his surgical career, he described the diagnosis and treatment of subdural hematomas in newborn infants. Important investigations on the cerebrospinal fluid and the nature of hydrocephalus were carried out under his direction, first by Walter Dandy and Kenneth Blackfan in the Hunterian Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and shortly afterward by Lewis Weed at the Laboratory of Surgical Research at Harvard. Cushing's principle interest throughout his professional career was the surgical treatment of brain tumors. By his careful clinical examination of patients. Cushing described for the first time a typical and composite picture of the more common tumors of the posterior fossa in children, particularly the cerebellar astrocytomas and medulloblastomas. Percival Bailey, working under Cushing's supervision at Harvard, studied and classified the glioma group of brain tumors. This contribution by Bailey was a major factor in the understanding of the characteristics and natural history of these tumors. In the closing years of Cushing's surgical practice, he published three major papers summarizing the characteristics, clinical picture, and treatment of the more common brain tumors in the pediatric age group. As a result of his exceptional surgical skill and innovations, he was able to achieve a surgical mortality of only 4% in operations on brain tumors in children. These landmark papers secured Cushing's place as a pioneer in pediatric neurosurgery.\r"

All cases demonstrated histological features of pineocytoma, according to the criteria of Borit et al., and of the so-called \"pineocytoma with neuronal differentiation,\" according to the criteria of Rubinstein. The experience obtained from the present series reveals that these tumors can occur in the initial decades of life, that a cystic appearance and the presence of calcifications are distinctive features of their radiological evaluation, and that they have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even when the histological data indicate local invasion. The convenience of reserving the term \"pineocytoma\" for these tumors, and of including the so-called \"pineocytomas without further differentiation\" within the group of pineoblastomas, is suggested in order to achieve a practical clinicopathological assessment of parenchymatous pineal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Arachnoid cysts of the spinal canal are relatively common lesions that may be either intra- or extradural. These cysts are usually asymptomatic but may produce symptoms by compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots. We report a case in which an intradural thoracic arachnoid cyst became symptomatic after a routine decompressive lumbar laminectomy for spinal stenosis. Myelography revealed no abnormality, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography demonstrated a mass within the posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal canal associated with anterior displacement and compression of the spinal cord. A change in the flow dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid probably allowed the development of spinal cord compression due to one of the following: expansion of the cyst, decreased cerebrospinal fluid buffer between the cord and the cyst, or epidural venous engorgement. A concomitant and more cephalad lesion such as an arachnoid cyst should be considered when myelopathic complications arise after lumbar surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography are useful to demonstrate the additional pathological processes.\r"

A clip along the internal carotid artery does not occlude blood flow to the aneurysm, and the aneurysmal neck and the distal posterior communicating artery are closer to the oculomotor nerve. This is the 27th reported case of a true posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The incidence of true posterior communicating artery aneurysms ranges from 0.1 to 2.8% of all aneurysm patients. Such aneurysms constitute 4.6 and 11% of so-called posterior communicating aneurysms in two series. Difficulty associated with a preoperative diagnosis has been documented in at least 4 cases. An awareness of this rare aneurysm is stressed in order to avoid operative complications.\r"

Of 11 patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stroke, 9 (82%) had greater than 90% carotid stenosis or occlusion; of 12 patients with stroke of undetermined mechanism, 10 (83%) had previous stroke, of which 8 were also of undetermined mechanisms. Disability after stroke was moderate or severe in 27 patients (57%). These data suggest that (1) stroke in patients taking aspirin has a variety of etiologies and frequently causes moderate or severe disability; (2) patients with carotid disease failing aspirin often have high-grade carotid stenosis or occlusion; (3) stroke of undetermined mechanism may recur more frequently than other stroke subtypes in patients taking aspirin.\r"

The clinical symptoms ranged from mild confusion to coma. Psychiatric manifestations or automatisms were rare. The presumed etiology was due to diverse causes, but a withdrawal state was the most common. EEG demonstrated continuous or nearly continuous generalized ictal discharges of variable morphology.

After surgical removal of the mesial temporal lobe structures, 2 blinded observers established volumetric cell densities for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule cell layer of the area dentata. Statistically significant correlations existed between presurgical memory impairment and cell counts (in CA3 and the hilar area, only) for patients with left temporal seizure foci.

Subsequent deterioration varied among patients, but a transitional oval shape was infrequent and oculomotor function was preserved until both pupils were enlarged and fixed.

Results show that normal aging leads to a reduction of motion sensitivity for the spatial frequency of 0.25 cpd. Compared with elderly controls, PD patients do not present specific abnormalities in this domain. However, for spatial frequencies of 1 and 4 cpd and temporal frequencies of 1 and 3 Hz, motion sensitivity is worse than static sensitivity in PD patients and not in elderly controls. These findings suggest a specific deficit of motion perception in PD, and possible dopaminergic involvement in the control of visuospatial behavior.\r"

This report describes a patient with CNH due to a brainstem anaplastic astrocytoma who also exhibited disturbances of sleep and ocular motor function. The CNH responded clinically to morphine sulfate and methadone. Analysis of ventilatory response to CO2 before and after morphine demonstrated a depression of ventilatory response (49 to 53% of baseline) and occlusion pressure response (35 to 50% of baseline) to CO2, with a requirement for high doses of naloxone (10 mg IV) to reverse the effect. Polysomnography revealed sustained hyperventilation, elevated O2 saturation, and low end-tidal CO2 throughout all stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Ocular motor evaluation disclosed absence of horizontal and reflexive saccades with compensatory head thrusts. Correlation of the clinical and physiologic data with the MRI abnormalities suggested that the lesion responsible for CNH in this patient might reside in the medial tegmental parapontine reticular formation. Since recurrent episodes of hyperventilation responded in a sustained fashion to IV and oral opiates, this treatment may warrant consideration in other patients with CNH.\r"

  ".W": "In the primate brain, there are strong connections among the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala, 3 structures of the ventromedial temporal lobe that are related to memory function. Because memory impairment is a central feature of Alzheimer's disease, we examined the probable cells of origin and terminal zones of these connections in the brains of humans affected by the disease, using thioflavine S, Alz-50, and anti-A4 amyloid protein immunocytochemistry. Specific cytoarchitectural areas and lamina that give rise to projections from the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala consistently contained neurofibrillary tangles. The terminal zones of many of these projections contained neuritic plaques, Alz-50-positive neuritic alterations, and A4 deposition. Other cytoarchitectural areas and lamina, sometimes immediately adjacent, were consistently spared from these Alzheimer changes. This pattern of Alzheimer-related alterations would disrupt projections among the entorhinal cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala at multiple sites, and also disrupt projections between these structures and cortical and subcortical targets. In functional terms, this pattern of structural damage is likely to be as devastating as bilateral destruction of the ventromedial temporal lobe, and thus contribute substantially to the memory disorder seen in this condition.\r"

The mean age of symptom onset was 38.1 years (range, 18 to 54) with 5.2 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SD) years of illness until the last follow-up visit. The presenting symptom was unilateral tremor in 6 patients, hand dystonia in 2, bradykinesia in 2, and abnormal gait in 1 patient. Three patients had a good response to levodopa, 4 had moderate response, and 2 patients had a poor response. During a mean follow-up period of 1.7 years (range, 4 months to 5 years), the Hoehn and Yahr score changed in only 3 patients: 2 gained 1.5 points and 1 gained 3 points over 2.5 years. We discuss the association between hemiparkinsonism-body hemiatrophy and contralateral hemispheric hemiatrophy, and raise the possibility of early childhood brain insult with delayed-onset parkinsonism.\r"

There was a high incidence of detectable IL-1 beta in patients with active MS compared with inactive MS or OND patients. TNF was also more frequently present in active MS than in OND CSF. By contrast, most MS CSF did not contain detectable IL-6. There was no correlation between the degree of CSF pleocytosis and the level of individual cytokines, suggesting that cytokine accumulations may be derived from CNS, and not CSF, cells. As IL-1 beta and TNF experimentally induce astrogliosis, demyelination, temperature elevation, lassitude, and sleep, and results raise the possibility that these cytokines may contribute to a variety of manifestations in MS and in other disease states.\r"

The estimated total number of TH-positive neurons in the A1 and the A2 regions was normal in PD and PSP patients. The sparing of medullary catecholaminergic cells in PD and PSP may be related to their minor degree of melanization and the possibility that intermediate compounds associated with the oxidative catabolism of norepinephrine and epinephrine may be less cytotoxic than those generated by degradation of dopamine. Patients with SND showed a marked loss of TH-immunoreactive cells in the A1 and the A2 groups, which may contribute to the impairment of vasomotor control characteristic of the disease.\r"

After 2 courses, 2 patients had complete responses, 7 had partial responses, 11 had stable disease, and 15 had progression. Significantly more patients receiving PCB had complete or partial responses or stable disease than a similar group of patients in a previous trial who received intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin (DDP). There is a significant advantage in time to disease progression for those receiving PCB compared with those receiving IA diaziquone (AZQ). Our results suggest that PCB is a more effective 2nd agent than IA DDP or AZQ following radiation and nitrosourea failure.\r"

We obtained maximal amplitudes with clockwise coil current in right-sided upper extremity muscles and counterclockwise coil current in left-sided upper extremity muscles. Optimal stimulation sites for biceps, triceps, and abductor digiti minimi were C-3 or C-4, C-4 or C-5, and C-4, C-5, or C-6, respectively. The latencies of the muscle responses varied little in the same subject in spite of marked amplitude changes due to suboptimal position of the coil or submaximal stimulator output. In abductor digiti minimi, the amplitude of the muscle response on cervical magnetic stimulation was 9 to 100% of the supramaximal amplitude on wrist electrical stimulation. We established normal values for latency, amplitude, and interside differences for the above 3 upper extremity muscles. The findings were reproducible, and the latencies obtained with large coils from different manufacturers in the same subjects were comparable. We found no advantage in bipolar recording over tendon-belly montage. Comparison of magnetic and electrical needle root stimulation in the same subjects showed that the magnetic stimulus was more proximal in biceps and triceps, and that the site of excitation was approximately the same in abductor digiti minimi. Indirect assessment of the longitudinal site of excitation based on F-wave minimal latency indicated that excitation occurred within millimeters of the emergence of axon of the peripheral motor neuron.\r"

This form of neurotoxicity could be completely abrogated by anti-gp120 but not by control preimmune serum, suggesting that the lethal effects of the purified preparations of the envelope protein were due to gp120 and not to a contaminant. Entry of HIV-1 is mediated by gp120 binding to a surface protein, designated \"CD4,\" which is located, for example, on T lymphocytes. However, in the present study, specific anti-CD4 antibodies, at concentrations known to block effects mediated by high-affinity binding to CD4 on the surface of rat T cells, did not prevent neuronal injury induced by gp120. These findings suggest that injury of central neurons engendered by gp120 may be responsible, at least in part, for the neurologic manifestations observed in as many as 2/3 of the patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, such as dementia, myelopathy, and visual loss, even in the absence of superinfection. In contrast with previous studies, however, this report suggests that the deleterious effects of gp120 on neurons may not be mediated via binding to the CD4 molecule.\r"

Twenty-five of 40 plaque-containing regions provided spectra of adequate quality. Of these, 8 spectra from 6 subjects were consistent with the presence of cholesterol or fatty acids; the remainder were similar to those obtained from white matter of normal volunteers. This early experience with regional proton spectroscopy suggests that individual plaques are distinct. These differences likely reflect dynamic stages of the evolution of the demyelinative process not previously accessible to in vivo investigation.\r"

We defined HLA restriction of the T lines by using monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic determinants on human HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules. MBP-specific T cell lines could be isolated with a comparable efficiency from MS patients and healthy individuals. In both groups, MBP-specific T lymphocytes recognized at least 4 different epitopes in the MBP molecule, and specificities showed comparable patterns for different MBP peptides. MBP-specific T cell lines derived from MS patients and controls were restricted by DR products of the human major histocompatibility class II locus. Notable phenotypic differences of T cell lines existed between the 2 groups. Lines isolated from MS patients expressed predominantly the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- phenotype, while some control lines were composed of up to 87% CD3+CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes. These findings illustrate the presence of MBP-specific T cells in MS patients and controls that are similarly sensitized to MBP and restricted by HLA-DR products.\r"

Whether these changes are primary or secondary to the disease process is not known. We tested T-cell clones derived from activated lymphocytes in the blood and CSF of MS patients and controls for their capacity to regulate T-cell responses to alloantigens. A wide spectrum of regulatory functions were observed, ranging from marked enhancement to almost complete suppression. Clones from different patient populations and anatomic sites were equivalent in their regulatory functions with the net effect of clones in each compartment being suppression. However, certain clones from CSF and peripheral blood had the capacity to stimulate autologous T cells. Percentages of such clones in the peripheral blood of MS patients were significantly higher than in controls, while percentages in MS and other neurologic diseases (OND) CSF were equivalent. Our data suggest that (1) functional suppressor cells are not lost from the blood or CSF or MS and OND patients, (2) lymphocytes that have entered the CNS in patients with MS and other CNS diseases have equivalent regulatory functions, (3) MS may be an illness in which peripheral immunologic events are important in perpetuating the disease process, and (4) responses to autologous antigens may also play a role in this perpetuation.\r"

Each had undergone hysterectomy or endometrial biopsy within 12 months of the original smear. The endometrial cells were classified as typical, atypical, or suspicious for carcinoma. Among premenopausal subjects, three of 57 with typical cells had endometrial hyperplasia, one of two with atypical cells had endometrial polyps, and both with cells suspicious for carcinoma had endometrial carcinoma. In the postmenopausal group, ten (13.5%) of 74 with typical endometrial cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma, and five (22.7%) of 22 with atypical cells and 24 77.4%) of 31 patients with suspicious cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma. The present findings and a review of the pertinent literature demonstrate that the classification system used is helpful in predicting the risk for endometrial disease in patients with endometrial cells seen on cervical cytologic smears during the secretory phase or in the postmenopausal period.\r"

We studied the validity of the colpophotograph as a measurement tool by determining the agreement of experienced colposcopists using colpophotographs of 50 women. Interobserver agreement was generally fair to good (kappa greater than or equal to 0.40) for the presence of the squamocolumnar junction and the area of ectopia but it was poor (kappa less than 0.40) for the area, border, and color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone. Intra-observer agreement was fair to good for the color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone, but it was poor for the area and border characteristics. We conclude that observer agreement studies should play a role in the validation of methods used in the visual diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Considerable lack of agreement in reporting cytologic findings is a well-known problem, and lack of agreement might be an even bigger problem in reporting colposcopic findings.\r"

Early hemorrhage occurred in 1.6, 13.3, and 6.6% of women, respectively (P less than .05), and late hemorrhage in 15.3, 3.6, and 11.7%, respectively. Considering early and late hemorrhage together, there was no significant difference among the three treatment groups. Dysmenorrhea tended to be more common after application of Sturmdorf sutures, as it was reported by 27.8, 13.2, and 14.3% of patients, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. Dysmenorrhea occurred in 13% of the cases with a cone height of 20 mm or less and in 26% of the cases with a cone height greater than 20 mm (P less than .05). Endocervical cells were present significantly more often after sampling with a cytobrush than with a cotton swab (P less than .0001), whereas the method of conization had no influence. In smears obtained with a cytobrush, endocervical cells were present in 88.0, 84.9, and 82.5% of the cases; in smears obtained with a cotton swab, endocervical cells were present in 46.6, 57.7, and 54.5%, respectively. We conclude that cold knife conization without Sturmdorf sutures is about equal to laser conization in overall complications, but the laser is preferable for outpatient treatment because of a lower frequency of early hemorrhage. Sturmdorf sutures should be avoided. Smears at follow-up should be taken with a cytobrush and a wooden spatula.\r"

Adenocarcinoma in situ had a uniform intact basement membrane, whereas the basement membrane of invasive adenocarcinoma was fragmented and irregular. Cases of early stromal invasion showed early gland buds and outpouchings with defective basement membrane staining. The degree of histologic differentiation of the tumor was not clearly related to the amount of basement membrane component staining. The concept of early stromal invasion in cervical adenocarcinoma, as supported by our immunohistochemical studies, is discussed as it relates to a possible pathogenic mechanism in early invasion and infiltration of adenocarcinoma of the cervix.\r"

Evidence is scant that such therapies benefit patients with fallopian tube carcinoma. Between December 1979 and July 1988, we treated 18 patients who had adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with the combination of cisplatin (50 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) administered intravenously on 1 day every 28 days. Histologic confirmation of fallopian tube carcinoma was obtained before entry in the study. Three patients had stage I disease, five had stage II, nine had stage III, and one had stage IV. Sixteen patients received the combination therapy as first-line treatment after cytoreductive surgery, and two patients received it for recurrent carcinoma. Seven patients had clinically measurable disease at the start of therapy. Two of these patients had a complete clinical response, two had stable disease, and three had progressive disease. Eight of the 15 patients with stages II-IV disease underwent second-look laparotomy; four had a complete response to therapy and four had a partial response, making the overall response rate 53%. The toxicity of the regimen was moderate. The median survival was 81 months. Patients with stages II-IV disease had a median survival of 43.9 months and a progression-free survival of 22.5 months. This regimen appears to be active in fallopian tube carcinoma and can result in response rates comparable to those reported for epithelial ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "A number of serum screening protocols are either currently in use or proposed to identify pregnant women under 35 years of age who are at increased risk for a Down syndrome fetus. It has been suggested that these same screening methods be applied to gravidas over 35 years of age to identify those women who should be offered amniocentesis. To evaluate the efficacy of screening for detection of aneuploid pregnancy in this age group, the serum samples of 34 women who underwent amniocentesis and who had confirmed fetal aneuploidy were assayed for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), hCG, and unconjugated estriol (E3). These concentrations were compared with those of 85 women with known euploid pregnancy who underwent amniocentesis for advanced maternal age. The mean multiple of the median (MoM) for each of the three markers was significantly different from control values in cases of trisomy 21 (AFP median MoM = 0.82; unconjugated E3 median MoM = 0.77; and hCG median MoM = 1.89). These differences were not found when other aneuploidies were considered. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cases and controls and examined for their ability to predict the need for amniocentesis, based on currently recommended risk levels. There was a significant difference between the mean likelihood ratio for cases of trisomy 21 compared with that of controls (mean likelihood ratio = 13.48); there was no significant difference for other aneuploidies (mean likelihood ratio = 1.08). Of the 16 cases of trisomy 21 analyzed, four would not have been diagnosed antenatally if recommendation against amniocentesis had been made based on each woman's individual age-specific risk as modified by her likelihood ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fetal loss rate within 4 weeks of the procedure was 2.3%. Fetal losses appeared to be related to maternal complications such as bleeding and leakage of fluid that occurred within a day of the procedure. No major maternal complications were noted. Information regarding neonatal outcome, including pulmonary complications and congenital orthopedic postural deformities, was found to be similar to that in previous reports.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic counseling concerning the risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations can be difficult; the risk of amniocentesis is weighed against that of chromosomal abnormalities in either one or both of the twins. Because most twins are dizygotic (each with a risk a priori of aneuploidy), the chance that one of the fetuses is affected is greater than would be expected for a singleton. Only three possibilities would result in either one or both twin's being affected: 1) dizygotic twins with one fetus affected, 2) dizygotic twins with both fetuses affected, and 3) monozygotic twins with both fetuses affected. Using existing tables of estimated risks of chromosomal abnormalities in singleton gestations and mathematically derived formulas, we created tables defining the age-related risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations. According to these tables, a patient at 33 years of age with a twin gestation has a risk of Down syndrome in at least one of her twins equivalent to that of a 35-year-old with a singleton. Prenatal genetic testing should be considered for women with twins at a younger age than the traditional 35.\r"

Neither maternal nor paternal smoking habits were significantly associated with the occurrence of congenital malformations. Maternal age was significantly (P less than .005) related to the incidence of major anomalies. Mothers aged 35 years and older who smoked were found to have a significantly (P less than .002) higher risk for minor malformations and a nonsignificantly increased rate of major malformations. Maternal cigarette smoking may be an important preventable risk factor for congenital anomalies among mothers aged 35 years or older.\r"

The ratios increased with age and were higher among women of black and other minority races than among white women for all age groups. The causes of death varied for different outcomes of pregnancy; pulmonary embolism was the leading cause of death after a live birth. Unmarried women had a higher risk of death than married women. The risk of death increased with increasing live-birth order, except for primiparas. In order to develop strategies to reduce the risk of maternal death in the United States, future studies should include expanded information about each death, which will allow better understanding of factors associated with maternal mortality.\r"

The condition has been thought to be one of hypoperfusion in which increased vascular resistance characterizes the associated hypertension. This study was designed to test an alternative hypothesis, that preeclampsia is characterized by high cardiac output. In a blinded longitudinal study of nulliparas with uncomplicated pregnancies, cardiac output was measured serially by Doppler technique. Cardiac output was elevated throughout pregnancy in patients who became preeclamptic (P = .006). Six weeks postpartum, the hypertension of the preeclamptic subjects had resolved but cardiac output remained elevated (P = .001) and peripheral resistance remained lower than in the normotensive subjects (P = .001). This study demonstrates that preeclampsia is not a disease of systemic hypoperfusion and challenges most current models of the disease based on that assumption.\r"

We studied seven chronically instrumented animals between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. The experimental sequence included: 1) at time 0, indomethacin, 2 mg/kg, or vehicle only intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes; 2) at 60 minutes, MgSO4 4 g IV over 5 minutes; 3) at 65 minutes, MgSO4 infusion at 4 g/hour; 4) at 150 minutes, maternal hemorrhage, 20 mL/kg, over 60 minutes; and 5) at 215 minutes, reinfusion of maternal blood over 60 minutes. Each animal was studied with and without indomethacin. Indomethacin, but not vehicle only, transiently increased maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure (MAP), decreased maternal and fetal heart rate, and decreased maternal cardiac output. Magnesium sulfate significantly decreased uterine vascular resistance and increased uterine blood flow both with and without indomethacin. Hemorrhage significantly decreased maternal MAP, heart rate, cardiac output, and uterine blood flow in both groups. The magnitude of each change was similar between the groups. For example, at the end of hemorrhage, maternal MAP was 36 +/- 7% below baseline (P = .0001) with indomethacin and 41 +/- 2% below baseline (P = .0001) in the vehicle-only group (P = not significant between groups). Hemorrhage significantly decreased fetal heart rate, pH, and PO2, and increased fetal MAP and PCO2 in both groups. We conclude that indomethacin did not alter the maternal or fetal hemodynamic response to MgSO4 infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes.\r"

Seven patients conceived after transplantation; the interval from transplantation to conception ranged from 3 weeks to 24 months. One patient received an allograft at 26 weeks' gestation for hepatic failure secondary to acute fulminant hepatitis B. Of the seven patients who conceived after transplantation, six had live births and one electively terminated her pregnancy. Five patients developed worsening hypertension and/or preeclampsia. Three patients developed severe preeclampsia and required delivery. One patient suffered acute allograft rejection during pregnancy which was successfully treated with corticosteroids. Two patients had persistent elevation of serum transaminases and two had severe anemia. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.8 weeks. Of the six live births to women who conceived after transplantation, five infants survived and are well and one infant died. There were no congenital anomalies. All mothers are alive at this time. Pregnancy in recipients of hepatic allografts is associated with good perinatal outcome, but there is an increased risk of preeclampsia, worsening hypertension, and preterm delivery. Pregnancy does not appear to have a deleterious effect on hepatic graft function or survival. Joint management of these patients by a transplant specialist and a perinatologist is essential.\r"

This study was designed to assess the temporal relationship between objective uterine activity monitoring, subjective maternal perception of uterine activity above a commonly used threshold value (four or more contractions per hour), and progressive cervical change. Daily tocodynamometry (7-9 AM) was recorded in 79 women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes from admission until the onset of spontaneous labor (5.3 +/- 6.3 days). The subjects were at bed rest, received no tocolytic therapy, and were instructed in the signs of labor and uterine self-palpation. Patients simultaneously provided a subjective assessment of uterine activity (four or more contractions per hour). The majority of uterine activity recordings (78%) revealed fewer than four contractions per hour, and the patients' subjective reports agreed in almost all instances (97.6%). On 91 days, four or more contractions per hour were recorded objectively, but the patients' subjective reports agreed in only 25 instances (27%). On the day of labor onset, significantly more women had an objective assessment (32%) (P less than or equal to .01). Patients subjectively identified labor onset 10.6 +/- 6.7 hours after objective monitoring indicated increased uterine activity, and when subjectively identified, both cervical dilatation (4.9 +/- 2.5 cm) and effacement (85 +/- 30%) were significantly advanced (P less than or equal to .001) compared with the admission examination (1.1 +/- 1.2 cm; 20 +/- 30%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the effect of angiotensin II infusion on uteroplacental blood flow is unknown and may be deleterious. Patients undergoing angiotensin sensitivity tests as part of a protocol examining the effect of aspirin on the incidence of preeclampsia were studied with Doppler velocimetry performed before and during the angiotensin II infusion. Fetal well-being was documented with biophysical profiles performed before and after the infusions. Neither the systolic-diastolic ratios in the uterine and umbilical arteries nor the biophysical profile scores were altered significantly (P = .43, P = .23, Wilcoxon signed-rank median test, and P = .35, Fisher exact test, respectively). These findings suggest that the angiotensin sensitivity test does not increase resistance to flow in the uterine or umbilical circulation, and therefore may be used safely in screening for preeclampsia.\r"

Eight of 316 control fetuses with abdominal circumference above the tenth percentile turned out to be IUGR infants at birth. The incidence of oligohydramnios was strikingly different among the three groups: 29% for the IUGR group, 9% for the non-IUGR group, and 0.6% for the controls (P less than .001). When the criteria of abdominal circumference below the tenth percentile and presence of oligohydramnios were used together, the positive predictive value doubled (from 38.1 to 66.7%; P less than .01). Oligohydramnios developed some time after the somatic evidence of fetal growth retardation in all cases in this study. Finally, there were no significant differences between fetal growth retardation with or without oligohydramnios with respect to maternal risk factors or fetal outcome. We conclude that in fetal growth retardation, the occurrence of oligohydramnios during the third trimester of pregnancy is not associated with worse fetal outcome.\r"

We found that, although the exodus of family physicians from obstetric practice that had been observed between 1985-1986 appears to have slowed, there is still substantial net attrition among family physicians. As a result, rural patients are having increasing difficulty obtaining local access to obstetric care. By contrast, the supply of obstetricians and midwives seems to be stable. All three groups of providers are increasingly reluctant to provide care to the growing number of Medicaid patients. Although tort reform may have slowed the rate at which providers are quitting obstetrics, equilibrium has not yet been achieved. Shortages of rural physicians and inadequate Medicaid reimbursement rates must be addressed to improve obstetric access for underserved groups.\r"

The purpose of this study was to test a proposed relationship between handedness and age at menopause. Two national survey data sets were used to compare recalled ages at menopause. Mexican-American women, ages 35-74, naturally postmenopausal for at least 1 year, were selected from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). White and black women were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-I) using similar criteria. The mean age at menopause was found to be earlier among left-handed women than right-handed women from the NHANES-I data set. In the HHANES data set, the mean age at menopause was significantly earlier among left-handed women than in right-handed women (t = 2.35, P less than .05). Early age at menopause among left-handed women may result from misclassification of handedness among older women or differential mortality among left-handed individuals. Alternatively, the association may be related to possible correlations between left-handedness and autoimmune disorders, which may include reactions against hormone receptor sites and oocytes.\r"

  ".W": "As the surgical approach for ectopic pregnancies evolves from radical to conservative procedures, the potential hazard of persistent ectopic pregnancy has become increasingly pertinent. From September 1, 1986 to August 31, 1989, 11 women with persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic salpingostomy were diagnosed and treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Persistent ectopic pregnancy was suspected in nine cases because of symptoms and in two because of plateauing beta-hCG titers. Ten of 11 patients underwent repeat surgery. Eight had partial or complete salpingectomy of the involved ipsilateral tube, two had repeat salpingostomies, and one was treated with methotrexate. When the 11 women with persistent ectopic pregnancies were compared with 70 patients treated successfully by laparoscopic salpingostomy using multivariate stepwise logistic regression, smaller size of the ectopic (P less than .01) and fewer days of amenorrhea (P less than .05) predicted persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic salpingostomy. Based upon our experience, we believe that earlier-treated ectopic pregnancies (ie, fewer than 42 days of amenorrhea) and/or smaller ectopics (ie, 2.0 cm or less in diameter) require treatment with particular caution and close postoperative surveillance.\r"

However, we have been unable to find any reports on the potential application of serum estradiol (E2) assays in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. We therefore concurrently measured serum E2, progesterone, and beta-hCG in 100 women with ectopic pregnancies, as well as in 69 controls with normal intrauterine pregnancies and 36 women with threatened abortion. The mean (+/- standard deviation) E2 levels for ectopic-pregnancy patients, the normal controls, and the women with threatened abortion were 281.1 +/- 115.6, 788.2 +/- 45.5, and 788.8 +/- 40.6 pg/mL, respectively; the mean levels in the ectopic group were significantly different (P less than .0001) from those of the other two groups. All but one of the ectopic pregnancies had values below 650 pg/mL for E2 and 23 ng/mL for progesterone, and all but one of the normal intrauterine pregnancies had values above these levels. Our data suggest that the addition of the estradiol assay, with or without progesterone, to the early evaluation of patients suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy may be helpful in diagnosis.\r"

After almost 20 years of experience, it is now apparent that the anticipated benefits of this technology have not materialized. Undesirable side effects of EFM include inappropriate operative intervention for some patients and increased liability for physicians and hospitals, resulting in an increase in the costs of obstetric services. After reviewing several research studies, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that EFM and intermittent auscultation are equivalent methods for intrapartum assessment. We have developed a protocol for the performance of intermittent auscultation, including indicated responses to different levels of bradycardia. This protocol has allowed us to substitute auscultation for EFM in a high percentage of patients using existing nursing personnel. Laboring patients should, at a minimum, receive information on both intermittent auscultation and EFM to enable them to make an informed choice of method for intrapartum fetal assessment.\r"

To provide this training, a Postgraduate Internship in Gynecology and Obstetrics for Physician Assistants has been developed at the North Central Bronx Hospital and the Montefiore Medical Center. It is the first program of its kind at the postgraduate level to educate physician assistants specifically for practice in obstetrics and gynecology. The program consists of 3 months of didactic lectures to review and update knowledge on topics in medicine, surgery, gynecology, preoperative and postoperative care, cardiac and trauma life support, and critical care, followed by a clinical year similar to that of a rotating physician intern. We believe that such postgraduate educational opportunities in gynecology and obstetrics benefit both the individual physician assistant's growth and development and the level of care delivered, and may be an answer to staffing needs.\r"

This study reports on the \"meconium-crit,\" a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and reproducible method of quantifying meconium concentration in amniotic fluid. The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between the meconium-crit and meconium concentration. Specimens were prepared by placing 3.0 g of fresh neonatal meconium into clear amniotic fluid and vortexing for 15 minutes to obtain a stock solution of 15.0 g meconium/100 mL amniotic fluid. Stock solutions were then diluted with clear amniotic fluid to obtain concentrations of 10.0, 7.5, 5.0, 3.0, and 1.5 g/100 mL. One-tenth milliliter of the amniotic fluid/meconium mixture was drawn into a standard hematocrit tube and centrifuged. The meconium-crit was then measured directly as with a hematocrit. Regression analysis indicated that meconium-crit values were linearly related to meconium concentration (r = 0.901-0.995). This method provides a reproducible means of quantifying meconium in amniotic fluid.\r"

The dominant events of the periovulatory phase are the LH surge and ovulation. The significant change during the luteal phase is the production of a nutritive mucus by the endometrial glands in preparation for an embryonic blastocyst. The cardinal passage of the menstrual phase is the menstrual flow itself. These different events (and the metabolic processes that regulate them) have wide-ranging effects on the integrity of the body. As Havelock Ellis, the eminent English psychologist, stated at the turn of this century, \"the omnipresent process of sex, as it is woven into the whole texture of our body, is the pattern of all the process of our life\" (source unknown). The sweeping influences of the menstrual cycle illustrate the extent to which the process of reproduction is indeed woven into the whole of the human body.\r"

If any of the pituitary or ovarian hormones becomes tonically elevated or suppressed, ovulation will cease. The charge to the clinician in evaluating disorders of ovulation is to determine which hormone(s) is tonically elevated or suppressed. Sex steroid hormones exert effects on their target tissues that can be observed directly. These changes aid the clinician in evaluating disorders of ovulation and establishing which hormone(s) is tonically elevated or suppressed. Changes in thermoregulation can be detected by the basal body temperature record. Changes in the vagina can be detected by cytologic examination. Changes in the endometrium can be observed by obtaining a biopsy specimen for histologic examination. Premenstrual molimina suggest to the woman and her clinician that ovulation has occurred. Utilization of these changes in clinical practice aids the clinician in making a specific diagnosis of the cause of anovulation and in developing a treatment plan. Moreover, when the woman is aware of these clinical changes, it makes her a more involved participant in her health care.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive vaginal bleeding, or menorrhagia, is one of the most common presenting symptoms for gynecologic patients. Although this disorder has many possible etiologies, it is generally possible to approach its diagnosis and management in an orderly fashion. When evaluating the menorrhagic patient, it important to gear the work-up toward a differential diagnosis that includes pregnancy-related causes, hormonal problems, iatrogenic etiologies, mechanical intrauterine disorders, infections of the lower genital tract, and gynecologic cancers (PHIMIC). This differential approach can guide the types of historical data obtained from the patient, focus the physical examination, and alert the practitioner to the most appropriate laboratory and radiologic evaluation. Therapy can differ widely, depending on the cause of the bleeding. Most types of menorrhagia respond to medical therapy with oral contraceptives, oral synthetic estrogens or progestins, and long-acting intramuscular progestins or GnRH agonists. Surgical approaches, such as dilatation and curettage or hysterectomy, are less and less a first-line therapy; but innovative surgical techniques such as hysteroscopy and laparoscopic surgery are becoming increasingly important. With rapid, goal-directed diagnosis and specific therapy, the medical complications, anxiety, and discomfort suffered by the woman with menorrhagia can be alleviated quickly.\r"

Limitation in the ability to diagnose and to treat these patients conservatively has in the past resulted in a high rate of hysterectomy. With increased understanding of the normal physiology of this stage of transition and with improved diagnostic tools, we are now able to come to a definitive diagnosis in most patients. This ability to assure the diagnosis has made it much easier to counsel the patient confidently about the appropriate course of action. We will continue to encounter the problem of hysterectomy for bleeding with no histologic lesion being found. Although reviewers' letters may be considered an unnecessary thorn in the side, the improved practice that has resulted from these efforts gives strong support to their continued activities. We can have confidence that our treatment plan evolved in a logical manner and offers our patients a high probability of benefit at justifiable risk.\r"

Some complaints reflect normal physiologic aspects of the menstrual cycle (mittelschmerz, menstrual awareness). Premenstrual syndrome can be diagnosed, but an effective and convenient treatment is lacking. Dysmenorrhea is the commonest source of cyclic pain, diagnosed by its characteristic history and rapid relief on administration of antiprostaglandin agents. Endometriosis is diagnosed surgically and best treated either surgically then, or medically by danazol or GnRH agonists. In contrast, adenomyosis is a problem commonly encountered in later life, and hysterectomy is usually needed for both definitive diagnosis and treatment.\r"

In the evaluation of the acute pain, it is important to remember that rapidity of diagnosis is important because of the possibility of significant morbidity and even death if a condition is not attended to rapidly. In recent years, laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis has provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of some of these infections, as well as possible therapeutic maneuvers. The evaluation of chronic pelvic pain requires a thorough attempt at careful diagnosis with minds open to the possibility that other organ systems besides the genital tract may be involved. Laparoscopy also may be an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the evaluation of the sequelae of pelvic inflammation leading to chronic pelvic pain. All therapeutic modalities that are instituted on the basis of the diagnostic evaluation must take into consideration that a strong emotional component is generally associated with chronic pelvic pain. Such components must be addressed in order to achieve the best possible results for the patient.\r"

The symptoms should occur each cycle only from the time near ovulation to soon after the onset of menses. There should be at least 1 week in follicular phase that is symptom-free. Symptoms should be severe enough to significantly interfere with the ability of the patient to function within her normal lifestyle. Diagnosis is based on clinical information from prospective charting of symptoms. Up to 50 per cent of patients who think they have PMS really suffer from another type of mental illness, usually a depressive disorder. Laboratory tests are not generally helpful in the diagnosis. Treatment is based on the type(s) of symptom(s). Available treatments are reviewed with documentation of results from double-blind placebo-controlled experimental designs. The etiology of PMS is not known. However, there are good empiric therapies available that can help most PMS patients.\r"

Compared with controls, those admitted were older (37 vs 20.5 years), and had a longer duration of anesthesia (145 vs 116 minutes) and surgery (104 vs 75 minutes) (P less than .01 for each). The time that surgery commenced and the use of perioperative medications were not significant factors. The most frequent reasons for overnight admission were nausea (38%) despite prophylaxis and the use of bilateral patches (16%). To minimize postoperative admissions, better strategies should be developed to decrease the frequency of significant postoperative nausea, the duration of surgery and anesthesia, and, if possible, the use of bilateral patches.\r"

The incidence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in the CRVO eyes at the first vitreous examination did not differ significantly from that in 64 age-matched control eyes. However, the incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes increased from 39.3% at the first vitreous examination to 58.5% after 6 months, and to 69.6% 1 year from the examination. The incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes during follow-up was statistically higher than that of the controls (P = .009). The incidence of PVD after the first vitreous examination was significantly higher in eyes with hemorrhagic retinopathy than in eyes with venous stasis retinopathy (P = .04). In the 34 eyes with macular edema, the edema lasted significantly longer in those with vitreomacular attachment (VMA) at the first examination than in those without VMA at this time (P = .02). VMA may play an important role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of macular edema in CRVO.\r"

The drugs were administered orally as well as topically according to a fixed regimen. The pupillary diameters, measured with calipers at various surgical steps, were significantly larger at every step in the study groups in which either of the adjuvants had been used than they were in the control group (P less than .001). Flurbiprofen tended to help maintain a larger pupillary diameter in the later stages of surgery than indomethacin, but this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that it is important to use prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors as adjuvants to routine mydriatics, and that flurbiprofen may be somewhat more effective than indomethacin in this capacity.\r"
