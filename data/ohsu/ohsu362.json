  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary receptors modulate renin release in several animals species. However, their involvement in reflex control of this humoral substance in humans is controversial. Furthermore, no information is available on the alteration of this control in hypertension. We studied the modulation of plasma renin activity (radioimmunoassay) in 12 normotensive subjects and in 12 age-matched subjects with untreated hypertension of mild or moderate degree. Cardiopulmonary receptors were stimulated by increasing central venous pressure (right atrial catheter) and cardiac volume (echocardiographic measurement) through passive leg raising and deactivated by reducing central venous pressure and cardiac volume through lower body negative pressure. The stimuli were maintained for 20 to 30 minutes, and their degree was set to avoid changes in blood pressure (indirect or direct measurements) and heart rate, thus avoiding involvement of arterial baroreceptors. In normotensive subjects, deactivation of cardiopulmonary receptors induced a progressive rise in plasma renin activity and stimulation of cardiopulmonary receptors induced a progressive fall. The reflex gain (ratio between plasma renin activity and central venous pressure or cardiac volume changes) was similar for deactivation and stimulation. During cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation, the gain corresponded to that obtained by dividing the increase in plasma renin by the reduction in central venous pressure induced by tilting. Cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation and stimulation also induced clear-cut changes in plasma renin activity in hypertensive subjects, but the percent magnitude of the reflex plasma renin activity excursion was less than that in normotensive subjects. These observations indicate that cardiopulmonary receptors modulate plasma renin activity in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the advances in the past 10 years in safe delivery of amino acids and fat emulsions peripherally, and with the ability to deliver hyperalimentation by a central venous line, patients can be fed enough calories, fat, and protein to prevent malnutrition or to treat it. Recognition and prevention of hospital malnutrition is a mandatory aspect of delivering good patient care. Offering advanced technology, skilled surgeons, and advanced-practice nursing care to the patient, without acknowledging his basic needs, reminds one of the ironic saying, \"The operation was a success, but the patient died.\" The nurse has a special role in assessment and treatment of malnutrition in the hospitalized patient.\r"

  ".W": "Esmolol is the first intravenous, short-acting, titratable beta-blocker available for use in critical care and surgical settings. The predominant pharmacodynamic actions of the drug include a reduction in HR, BP, rate-pressure product, LVEF, and cardiac index. A desirable pharmacokinetic feature of esmolol is its esterase-induced rapid metabolic inactivation, which results in a return of all hemodynamic parameters to pretreatment levels within 30 minutes after discontinuation of the infusion. Control over the magnitude and duration of beta-blockade and the relative cardioselectivity of esmolol make it an ideal agent for use in critically ill patients, including those who, because of other conditions, are at risk if treated with beta-blockers. The clinical indications for esmolol therapy include SVT and perioperative tachycardia and hypertension. In patients with myocardial ischemic conditions (acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina), esmolol was safe and produced clinically significant reductions in HR and rate-pressure product. In general, untoward reactions to esmolol have been minimal, mild, and transient. Although attention must be given to the possibility of systolic hypotension during esmolol administration, this complication often occurs at doses beyond those which provide optimal therapeutic response and may be avoided by titrating to the minimal effective dose. If systolic hypotension occurs, it is reversible by either reducing the dose or discontinuing the esmolol infusion. A nursing plan of care should be developed for patients receiving esmolol therapy. Dosage and administration must be individualized. Careful titration of the esmolol infusion and monitoring of therapeutic and safety parameters by nursing professionals will promote the achievement of maximum beta-blocker effect while avoiding persistent and unnecessary adverse reactions.\r"

About 30% of the patients also had lesions in the spine, sacroiliac region or the peripheral joints. Bone and joint lesions followed a variable and intermittent clinical course over a long period of time. Biopsies in eight cases showed similar inflammatory changes in skin, bone and synovium, with infiltration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This suggests that there is a common pathogenesis in the three tissues.\r"

In addition, the effect of 2- to 3-h euglycemic steady state hyperinsulinemia on serum IGF-binding protein and IGF-1 levels was studied in some subjects in each of the fasted groups. Compared with normal subjects, the mean serum IGF-binding protein levels were 4-fold (P less than 0.001) higher in type I diabetic patients treated with conventional insulin injections, 2.5-fold (P less than 0.001) higher in those treated with continuous sc insulin infusion, and 2-fold (P less than 0.05) higher in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the patients with insulinoma, the mean IGF-binding protein level was 63% below normal (P less than 0.001), and it normalized after removal of the tumor. There was a slight negative correlation between the IGF-binding protein level and insulin dose in the diabetic patients (r = -0.22; P less than 0.05). In normal subjects, serum insulin concentrations were 2-fold higher (P less than 0.001) and the IGF-binding protein level was 29% lower after a meal (P less than 0.05) than in the fasting state. Serum IGF-I concentrations were virtually identical in the type 1 and 2 diabetic patients, insulinoma patients, and normal subjects. During steady state euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, the IGF-binding protein level fell by 40-70% in each group (P less than 0.001), whereas the IGF-I level declined (P less than 0.05) in the type 2 diabetic patients only. The decline of binding protein was closely related to the baseline level (r = 0.94; P less than 0.001). No correlation was found between serum IGF-I and binding protein levels in any group. In conclusion, 1) serum 34K IGF-binding protein levels are elevated in type 1 and 2 diabetic patients and decreased in patients with insulinoma; 2) the serum binding protein, but not IGF-I concentration is decreased by acute hyperinsulinemia; and 3) these data suggest that the serum insulin concentration plays a role in regulation of the serum 34K IGF-binding protein concentration.\r"

In this study we examined the effect of dopamine receptor agonists and/or antagonists on plasma beta EP, beta LPH, cortisol, and PRL levels in normal subjects. Neither direct dopamine (DA) agonist drugs, DA (1 microgram/kg min for 120 min), bromocriptine (2.5 mg po), L-dopa (500 mg po) or an indirect DA agonist, nomifensine (200 mg po), significantly altered plasma beta EP and beta LPH levels. The administration of metoclopramide, a DA antagonist (10 mg iv), significantly increased plasma beta EP, beta LPH, PRL, and cortisol levels. This effect was completely reversed by pretreatment with L-dopa (500 mg po) and only partially antagonized by DA infusion. Domperidone (10 mg iv), a DA antagonist which does not cross the blood brain barrier, increased only plasma beta EP levels, an effect inhibited both by L-dopa and DA. After dexamethasone (2 mg/day for 2 days) domperidone still increased plasma beta EP and PRL levels. The concomitant increase of beta EP, beta LPH, and cortisol after metoclopramide suggests that endogenous DA inhibits the secretion of proopiomelanocortin-related peptides. Moreover, since domperidone increases only beta EP and this effect is not altered by dexamethasone, there may be a corticotropin-releasing hormone-independent source of circulating beta EP in humans, which is inhibited by DA.\r"

  ".U": "88115821\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiovascular complications are a well recognized side-effect of antihormonal therapy in men with prostatic carcinoma. We studied changes in plasma lipoproteins in patients with prostate cancer during treatment with several androgen suppression therapies. Estrogen, orchiectomy, and a combination of LHRH agonist and antiandrogen (flutamide) reduced plasma testosterone concentrations (89-92%) and plasma estradiol decreased by 85%, 44%, and 54%, respectively. Estrogen induced hypertriglyceridemia and elevation of plasma HDL cholesterol, phospholipid, and apolipoprotein A-I and A-II concentrations. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased but LDL apolipoprotein B did not. These results suggest that the cardiovascular complications that occur during estrogen administration are not mediated through changes in lipoprotein profile, other than the hypertriglyceridemic effect. Orchiectomy caused hypercholesterolemia and an increase in both total and LDL apolipoprotein B, all of which are strong determinants of cardiovascular disease. The high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration was not affected despite a reduction in plasma testosterone, perhaps due to a simultaneous decrease in estradiol. Combination therapy had no effect on plasma lipid and apolipoprotein B concentrations, but very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apolipoprotein B decreased, and LDL apolipoprotein B increased. The HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I concentrations increased but A-II and phospholipids did not. These results suggest enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity, consistent with the reciprocal changes in VLDL and LDL apolipoprotein B levels, apolipoprotein B enrichment of LDL particles, and increase in HDL cholesterol. The higher apolipoprotein A-I to A-II ratio indicates an increase in HDL2 subfraction due to inhibition of endothelial hepatic lipase, increased secretion of apolipoprotein A-I, or both. These effects are attributed to estradiol, which decreased less than after orchiectomy, and to additional adrenal androgen inhibition by flutamide. We conclude that estradiol plays an important role in determining plasma lipoprotein concentrations in men, and androgens exert an antagonist effect. The lipoprotein profile resulting from the combination treatment is more beneficial than that resulting from orchiectomy or estrogen administration.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggest that the rate of rise of the plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) concentration, rather than the steady state level achieved, may be the stimulus of the increased insulin secretion that occurs when fat is ingested with carbohydrate. To test this hypothesis six normal men were given a 5-g iv bolus dose of glucose 15 min after a carbohydrate meal with or without fat. At the time of the iv glucose injection after the fat-containing meal, the rate of rise of plasma GIP was maximum, but the level was only 40% of the achieved by 30 min. Plasma GIP did not change after the meal without fat. After the fat meal, peak insulin and C-peptide levels in response to iv glucose were 60% greater than those after carbohydrate alone despite similar peak blood glucose levels. The calculated insulin clearance was not altered by the fat meal. We conclude that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is increased early after fat ingestion, possibly due to a rise in GIP or other incretins.\r"

  ".U": "88115827\r", 
  ".W": "The function of the adrenal zona glomerulosa was studied in two pubertal siblings with the hypertensive virilizing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia who had never been treated. Initially, their plasma 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) levels were very high, PRA was suppressed, and plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB) were undetectable. To selectively study zona glomerulosa function, the patients and five normal subjects were given dexamethasone (2 mg/day; thus suppressing zona fasciculata function), and their sodium intake was restricted to 10 mmol/day. After 3-5 days, the zona glomerulosa was stimulated with either angiotensin II or potassium chloride. The same protocol was repeated in the patients at various intervals up to 39 months after beginning maintenance therapy with dexamethasone (0.25 mg twice daily). PRA, plasma aldosterone, and 18-OHB remained low during the first 6 months of treatment. After the first year, PRA recovered, and the zona glomerulosa began to respond. Plasma aldosterone and 18-OHB levels reached normal basal and stimulated values in one of the patients after 2 yr of treatment, but remained subnormal after 39 months of treatment in the other patient. Both patients, however, had persistently elevated plasma DOC concentrations, suggesting slight but definite impairment of 11 beta-hydroxylation in the zona glomerulosa. We conclude that in spite of a severe and persistent 11 beta-/18-hydroxylation deficiency in the zona fasciculata, the zona glomerulosa can recover almost completely after prolonged treatment. Appropriate stimulation, however, discloses a minor 11 beta-hydroxylation impairment also in the zona glomerulosa. In addition, the lack of parallelism in zona glomerulosa 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation of DOC provides evidence for the concept of different 18-hydroxylating systems in the adrenal cortex.\r"

  ".W": "The proteins of the major histocompatibility system (HLA in humans) play an essential role in the regulation of immune responses due to their involvement in the presentation of antigen to T lymphocytes. Thyroid follicular cells (thyrocytes) from patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis demonstrate increased expression of HLA class I and aberrantly or inappropriately express class II antigens, a phenomenon that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases. To establish if these changes in the expression of HLA molecules are characteristic of thyroid autoimmune disease, the immunopathological features (including class I and class II antigen expression) of 100 thyroidectomy specimens from patients with nonautoimmune thyroid disease were studied by indirect immunofluorescence, and the results compared with the findings in specimens from 14 patients with Graves' disease and 12 subjects undergoing laryngectomies for carcinoma. Increased class I product expression was found in 61% of all tissues studied, with maximal occurrence in papillary carcinomas (100%) and Graves' disease (86%), but it was also detected in 50% of the glands containing nodular lesions and in 16% of the control glands. Inappropriate class II molecule expression was found in Graves' disease (71%), hyperplastic nodules (53%), multinodular glands (44%), papillary carcinomas (38%), and 16% of the control glands. In summary, an increase in inappropriate HLA class I and class II expression was very common in nonautoimmune thyroid glands, but it generally occurred in the context of lymphocytic infiltration and thyroid autoantibodies (i.e. focal thyroiditis). Multiple correlation analyses of these 4 phenomena indicated heterogeneity in the mechanism leading to the inappropriate expression of thyrocyte class II antigens in the different conditions studied.\r"

The majority of the diabetic patients had normal PRA and active renin levels before and after furosemide, but in 4 normal subjects and 5 diabetic patients PRA did not rise after furosemide treatment to at least 0.25 ng angiotensin I/(L.s) as previously found in 90% of normal subjects. Two thirds of the diabetic patients had higher plasma prorenin levels than the normal subjects. Four of the 5 diabetic patients whose PRA failed to rise to the usual level after furosemide treatment attained a plasma prorenin level higher than any normal subject, suggesting that furosemide stimulated synthesis and secretion of prorenin, but that conversion of prorenin to active renin was impaired. These 5 diabetic patients also had higher plasma creatinine and potassium levels as well as an increased frequency of albuminuria compared with the other diabetic patients. In contrast, the 4 normal subjects whose PRA failed to reach the usual level after furosemide treatment had low unresponsive prorenin levels, indicating that furosemide did not evoke the expected increase in prorenin or renin synthesis. We conclude that the inability of some diabetic patients to increase PRA after furosemide treatment is not dependent on failure of renin synthesis, but reflects an impairment of the normal processing of prorenin, leading to high levels of prorenin in plasma.\r"

In animals fed diets enriched with 0.1, 0.25, or 1% cholesterol for 1 mo, receptor-dependent LDL transport in the liver was suppressed by 43, 63, and 77%, respectively, and there were reciprocal changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In addition, dietary triglycerides modified the effect of dietary cholesterol on hepatic LDL transport and plasma LDL concentrations so that at each level of cholesterol intake, polyunsaturated triglycerides diminished and saturated triglycerides accentuated the effect of dietary cholesterol. When animals were raised from weaning on diets containing small amounts of cholesterol, the decline in receptor-dependent LDL transport was nearly abolished by the addition of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated triglycerides, but was markedly augmented by the addition of saturated lipids. When animals raised on diets containing cholesterol and saturated triglycerides were returned to the low cholesterol, low triglyceride control diet, hepatic receptor-dependent LDL transport and plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations returned essentially to normal within 2 wk. Neither receptor-independent LDL transport nor the receptor-dependent uptake of asialofetuin was significantly altered by dietary cholesterol or triglyceride suggesting that the effect of these lipids on hepatic LDL receptor activity was specific and not due to a generalized alteration in the physiochemical properties of hepatic membranes. These studies demonstrate the important role of saturated triglycerides in augmenting the effect of cholesterol in suppressing hepatic LDL receptor activity and elevating LDL-cholesterol levels.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of the monoclonal antibodies against the cell surface molecule Mac-1 on C3bi-mediated rosetting and IgG-mediated rosetting and phagocytosis by human peripheral blood monocytes. Highly purified M1/70 F(ab')2, used in the fluid phase, inhibited both monocyte functions. Half-maximal C3bi rosette inhibition occurred at a concentration of 2 nM F(ab')2 M1/70. An equivalent decrease in IgG-mediated rosetting required 10 nM M1/70 F(ab')2, and 50% inhibition of IgG-mediated phagocytosis required 7 nM antibody. Mo-1 F(ab')2 inhibited EC3bi binding with an ID50 of 0.3 nM, whereas 50% decrease in IgG-mediated rosetting required 70 nM of this antibody. OKM1 did not inhibit rosettes of sheep erythrocytes opsonized with IgG antibody (EA) at all. F(ab')2 M1/70 did not affect the binding of monomeric human IgG to monocytes, but did substantially decrease the binding of IgG aggregates. Half-maximal inhibition of aggregated IgG binding at 0 degrees C occurred at 8 nM F(ab')2 M1/70, very close to the concentration that caused equivalent inhibition of IgG-mediated phagocytosis. Aggregated IgG inhibited the binding of radiolabeled M1/70 to monocytes by approximately 40%, suggesting that some, but not all Mac-1 molecules were associated with IgG receptors under these conditions. When cells were allowed to adhere to surfaces coated with M1/70 or Mo-1 F(ab')2, C3bi-mediated rosetting was inhibited, but IgG mediated-phagocytosis was unaffected. Moreover, the dose response of inhibition of phagocytosis by fluid-phase F(ab')2, of anti-Mac-1 monoclonals was similar on monocytes adherent to albumin-coated and antibody-coated surfaces. Kinetic experiments showed that even prolonged incubation of monocytes on M1/70 coated surfaces did not lead to inhibition of EA binding nor did these incubations alter the dose response for inhibition of EA binding by fluid-phase M1/70 F(ab')2. This suggested that not all molecules recognized by M1/70 are freely mobile in the plasma membrane. Indeed, only approximately 60% of 125I-M1/70-biding sites were lost even after 4 h when monocytes were adherent to M1/70-coated surfaces. We conclude that some anti-Mac-1 antibodies can inhibit EA binding because of their epitope specificity, independent of any direct interaction with monocyte Fc receptors. This interference with IgG-Fc receptor-mediated binding and ingestion apparently occurs because of antibody binding to a subpopulation of Mac-1 molecules which are associated with IgG Fc receptors and remain on the apical membrane of monocytes adherent to anti-Mac-1-coated surfaces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88115989\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies of human adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) have focused on enzyme catalytic activity, and have not measured the LPL protein directly. To study the regulation of the LPL protein, an antibody against purified bovine LPL was used. To demonstrate the specificity of the antiserum, adipose homogenates were Western blotted, and adipocytes were radiolabeled and the cell homogenates immunoprecipitated, yielding a single specific band at 53 kD. Breakdown products of LPL were demonstrated at 35 and 20 kD by Western blotting. An ELISA for human adipose LPL was established, in which LPL was sandwiched between affinity-purified antibody and biotinylated affinity-purified antibody. The standard curves for bovine LPL and human adipose LPL were parallel, and LPL activity correlated strongly with LPL immunoreactive mass. Thus, the bovine LPL standard curve was used to estimate LPL immunoreactive mass from human adipose tissue. The regulation of LPL activity and immunoreactive mass were compared in cultured adipocytes in the presence an absence of insulinlike growth factor-I/somatomedin C (IGF-I), insulin, and fetal bovine serum. IGF-I and a high insulin concentration (70 nM) stimulated only the heparin-releasable (HR) component of LPL activity and immunoreactive mass, and neither IGF-I nor insulin affected LPL specific activity. In contrast, 10% fetal bovine serum stimulated HR activity, HR mass, and cellular extractable (EXT) immunoreactive mass, with no effect on EXT activity. This resulted in a decrease in EXT specific activity in response to serum. The effects of the locally produced nucleosides adenosine and inosine were studied in a similar manner. As with serum, adenosine stimulated HR activity, HR mass, and EXT immunoreactive mass, resulting in a decrease in EXT specific activity. Inosine stimulated an increase in HR activity and HR mass, but had no effect on EXT, and thus did not change LPL specific activity. Thus, a sensitive ELISA for adipose tissue LPL has been developed using a specific, well-characterized antibody. Regulation of human LPL immunoreactive mass was demonstrated in vitro by IGF-I, serum, high concentrations of insulin, adenosine, and inosine. This method will permit further investigations into the regulation of the LPL protein.\r"

The purification involves heat treatment of plasma, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on Affi-Gel Blue, heparin-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite. Purified hHGF shows several bands with molecular weights between 76,000 and 92,000. Each band shows growth-stimulating activity on cultured hepatocytes which is proportional to the intensity of the band. After reduction of the sample with 2-mercaptoethanol, SDS-PAGE yields two chains with molecular weights of 31,500-34,500 and 54,000-65,000. The effect of hHGF on DNA synthesis by hepatocytes is half-maximal at 3.5 ng/ml. hHGF stimulates proliferation of cultured hepatocytes more effectively than human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) or insulin, and the effect of hHGF is additive or synergistic with the maximal effects of hEGF and insulin. These results suggest that hHGF is a new growth factor which is different from hEGF.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion and hepatic extraction of insulin were compared in 14 normal volunteers and 15 obese subjects using a previously validated mathematical model of insulin secretion and rate constants for C-peptide derived from analysis of individual decay curves after intravenous bolus injections of biosynthetic human C-peptide. Insulin secretion rates were substantially higher than normal in the obese subjects after an overnight fast (86.7 +/- 7.1 vs. 50.9 +/- 4.8 pmol/m2 per min, P less than 0.001, mean +/- SEM), over a 24-h period on a mixed diet (279.6 +/- 24.2 vs. 145.8 +/- 8.8 nmol/m2 per 24 h, P less than 0.001), and during a hyperglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (102.2 +/- 10.8 vs. 57.2 +/- 2.8 nmol/m2 per 180 min, P less than 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed a highly significant relationship between insulin secretion and body mass index. Basal hepatic insulin extraction was not significantly different in the normal and obese subjects (53.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 51.6 +/- 4.0%). In the normal subjects, fasting insulin did not correlate with basal hepatic insulin extraction, but a significant negative correlation between fasting insulin and hepatic insulin extraction was seen in obesity (r = -0.63, P less than 0.02). This finding reflected a higher extraction in the six obese subjects with fasting insulin levels within the range of the normal subjects than in the nine subjects with elevated fasting insulin concentrations (61 +/- 3 vs. 45 +/- 6%, P less than 0.05). During the hyperglycemic clamp, the insulin secretion rate increased to an average maximum of 6.2-fold over baseline in the normal subjects and 5.8-fold in the obese subjects. Over the same time, the peripheral insulin concentration increased 14.1-fold over baseline in the normals and 16.6-fold over baseline in the obese, indicating a reduction in the clearance of endogenously secreted insulin. Although the fall in insulin clearance tended to be greater in the obese subjects, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. Thus, under basal, fasting conditions and during ingestion of a mixed diet, the hyperinsulinemia of obesity results predominantly from increased insulin secretion. In patients with more marked basal hyperinsulinemia and during intense stimulation of insulin secretion, a reduction in insulin clearance may contribute to the greater increase in peripheral insulin concentrations that are characteristic of the obese state.+\r"

Insulin secretory rates were calculated from plasma C-peptide levels using individually derived C-peptide kinetic parameters and a validated open two-compartment model of peripheral C-peptide kinetics. Insulin secretion rates were consistently elevated in the obese subjects under basal conditions (11.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/h) and in the 4 h after breakfast (139 +/- 15 vs. 63 +/- 5 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001), lunch (152 +/- 16 vs. 67 +/- 5 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001), and dinner (145 +/- 18 vs. 65 +/- 6 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001). In the normal subjects, basal insulin secretion represented 50 +/- 2.1% of total 24-h insulin production, insulin secretion returned to baseline between meals, and equal quantities of insulin were secreted in the 4 h after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite the fact that subjects consumed half the number of calories at breakfast compared to lunch and dinner. Overall glucose responses were also similar after the three meals. In contrast, the pattern of insulin secretion in obese subjects was largely normal, albeit set at a higher level. However, the insulin secretion rate after meals did not return to baseline, and the secretion rate immediately before lunch (350.5 +/- 81.9 pmol/min) and dinner (373.6 +/- 64.8 pmol/min) was considerably higher than the secretion rate immediately before breakfast (175.5 +/- 18.5 pmol/min). In these overweight subjects, the glucose response after lunch was lower than after dinner. Analysis of individual 24-h insulin secretory profiles in the normal subjects revealed that insulin secretion was pulsatile. On average 11.1 +/- 0.5 pulses were produced in each 24-h period. The most prevalent temporal distribution of postmeal secretory pulses was two pulses after breakfast and three pulses after both lunch and dinner. Insulin secretion was also pulsatile during the period without meal stimuli: 3.9 +/- 0.3 pulses occurred during the period of overnight sampling and in the 3-h period before ingestion of the breakfast meal. In the obese subjects, the number and timing of secretory pulses was similar to those of normal volunteers, although the amplitude of the pulses was significantly greater. In both groups of subjects, greater than 80% of insulin pulses were concomitant with a pulse in glucose concentration in the postmeal period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88115997\r", 
  ".W": "Many mammalian cell types exhibit Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, and activation of these channels by increasing intracellular calcium generally leads to a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Their presence in B lymphocytes is as yet uncertain. Crosslinking Ig on the surface of B lymphocytes is known to increase the level of free cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i). However, rather than hyperpolarization, a depolarization has been reported to occur after treatment of B lymphocytes with anti-Ig. To determine if Ca2+-dependent K+ channels are present in B lymphocytes, and to examine the relationship between intracellular free calcium and membrane potential, we monitored [Ca2+]i by means of indo-1 and transmembrane potential using bis(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric)trimethine oxonol in human tonsillar B cells activated by anti-IgM. Treatment with anti-IgM induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i and a simultaneous hyperpolarization. A similar hyperpolarization was induced by ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore. Delaying the development of the [Ca2+]i response by increasing the cytoplasmic Ca2+-buffering power delayed the hyperpolarization. Conversely, eliminating the sustained phase of the [Ca2+]i response by omission of external Ca2+ abolished the prolonged hyperpolarization. In fact, a sizable Na+-dependent depolarization was unmasked. This study demonstrates that in human B lymphocytes, Ca2+-dependent K+ channels can be activated by crosslinking of surface IgM. Moreover, it is likely that, by analogy with voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, Na+ can permeate through these ligand-gated Ca2+ \"channels\" in the absence of extracellular Ca2+.\r"

  ".W": "In autoimmune gastritis antibodies against a membrane-bound parietal cell antigen of previously unknown function are present in the sera of patients. In this study, a vesicular membrane preparation of porcine gastric mucosa cells was found to be a potent antigenic source. This preparation blocked greater than 90% of antibody binding to a lysate of gastric mucosa cells. The membrane fraction contained H+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.36) as the major protein, which in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migrated with a weight of 92 kD. After reduction and alkylation, this component was resolved into two bands of similar staining intensity (92 and 88 kD). Immunoblotting analysis showed that sera of patients recognized antigen with pattern identical to the major protein of the vesicular membranes. Protein A-Sepharose beads preincubated with immunoglobulins of five individual patient (but not control) sera were all found to reduce both the H+,K+-ATPase activity and the amount of parietal cell antigen of a preparation of vesicular membranes solubilized in n-octylglucoside. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that the major parietal cell antigen is identical to the acid-producing enzyme, H+,K+-ATPase, of the parietal cell.\r"

  ".U": "88116003\r", 
  ".W": "There is much interest in defining the signals that initiate abnormal proliferation of cells in a variety of states characterized by the presence of mononuclear phagocytes. Since IL-1 is a major secretory product of activated human monocytes we examined whether this cytokine can stimulate the growth of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Neither recombinant IL-1 (rIL-1) alpha (less than or equal to 5.0 ng/ml) nor beta (less than or equal to 100 ng/ml) stimulated SMC growth during 2-d incubations under usual conditions. IL-1 did stimulate SMC to produce prostanoids such as PGE1 or PGE2 that can inhibit SMC proliferation. When prostaglandin synthesis was inhibited by indomethacin or aspirin both rIL-1 alpha and beta (greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml) markedly increased SMC growth. In longer-term experiments (7-28 d) rIL-1 stimulated the growth of SMC even in the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The addition of exogenous PGE1 or PGE2 (but not PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, PGI2) to indomethacin-treated SMC blocked their mitogenic response to rIL-1. Antibody to IL-1 (but not to platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]) abolished the mitogenic response of SMC to rIL-1. Exposure of SMC to rIL-1 or PDGF caused rapid (maximal at 1 h) and transient (baseline by 3 h) expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene, determined by Northern analysis. We conclude that IL-1 is a potent mitogen for human SMC. Endogenous prostanoid production simultaneously induced by IL-1 appears to antagonize this growth-promoting effect in the short term (2 d) but not during more prolonged exposures. IL-1 produced by activated monocytes at sites of tissue inflammation or injury may thus mediate both positive and negative effects on SMC proliferation that are temporally distinct.\r"

  ".W": "The very late activation antigens (VLA) are a subset of the superfamily of cell surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors from extracellular matrix proteins. One or more of the VLA heterodimers are present on T lymphocytes and most other cell types, including platelets. We have used VLA-specific monoclonal antibodies to isolate the reactive platelet membrane molecules. We have identified them as previously characterized platelet surface glycoproteins and have compared them with VLA molecules isolated from lymphocytes and other cells. Utilizing one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional O'Farrell gel electrophoresis, and nonreduced-reduced two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we show that reduced VLA molecules of platelets are composed of three chains of molecular weights 165,000, 145,000, and 140,000 that possess the physicochemical properties of platelet glycoproteins GPIa, GPIc alpha, and GPIIa. GPIa corresponds to the VLA 165,000 alpha 2-chain, GPIIa corresponds to a 145,000 Mr VLA beta-chain, and GPIc alpha corresponds to a 140,000 Mr VLA alpha-chain. The polypeptide structure of VLA molecules on platelets and lymphocytes are very similar or identical. Platelet proteins GPIa and GPIIa exist as a mixed heterodimer in detergent lysates and correspond with the VLA-2 heterodimer found on activated T lymphocytes and other cell types. The platelet glycoproteins GPIIa and GPIc form a second mixed heterodimer. The mAb A-1A5, which binds to the VLA beta chain, binds to platelet GPIIa and precipitates both the GPIIa-GPIa and GPIIa-GPIc heterodimers, and binds to 4,926 +/- 740 sites per platelet. A VLA-2-specific mAb, 12F1, which binds to the VLA alpha 2-chain reacts with GPIa and immunoprecipitates only the GPIIa-GPIa heterodimer, and binds to 1,842 +/- 449 sites per platelet. The similarity of VLA chains and platelet GPIIa, GPIa, and GPIc molecules suggests that these molecules may have similar functions on various cell types.\r"

  ".U": "88116007\r", 
  ".W": "An abnormal spectrin, in which one subunit is truncated, has been detected in a large German family. The inheritance is autosomal dominant. The affected members of the family suffer in widely varying degree from a microcytic hemolytic anemia. The red cell morphology varies correspondingly from smooth elliptocytes to predominantly poikilocytes. The abnormal spectrin makes up approximately 30% of the total and is almost entirely present as the dimer. The truncated chain is not phosphorylated by the endogenous cAMP-independent kinase, and it has been identified as a chain of beta-type, using monoclonal antibodies. Because a univalent terminal spectrin alpha-chain fragment will bind to normal dimers with an association constant lower by only a factor of two than that for the self-association of the dimers, it would be expected that the mutant dimers (alpha beta') would readily enter into an association with normal (alpha beta) dimers to give alpha 2 beta beta' tetramers (though not with each other). In dilute solution this is indeed observed, and the diminution in tetramer concentration when 30% of normal spectrin is replaced by alpha beta' dimers, amounts to only a small proportion. Moreover, in the membrane skeleton, if there is pairwise apposition of dimer units, only 9% of pairings will be between units that cannot associate. We have shown that the failure of alpha beta' dimers to enter into heterologous associations in situ is not due to the elimination of the ankyrin binding site near the truncated end of the beta-chain: this site is fully functional, as judged by rebinding to spectrin-depleted vesicles. When the spectrin is extracted from the membrane in the cold, the material released initially consists almost entirely of alpha beta' dimers; when the spectrin of normal membranes is partly dissociated to dimers in situ by warming at low ionic strength, extraction in the cold then leads similarly to much more rapid release of the dimer than of the tetramer. The similar rates of liberation of normal and abnormal dimer make it unlikely that the interaction of the latter with the membrane is in any way defective. When mixtures of alpha beta and alpha beta' dimers are bound to spectrin-depleted inside-out membrane vesicles from normal cells and tetramers are allowed to form by equilibration at 30 degrees C, the proportion of the abnormal species appearing in the tetramer is much lower than would be expected on a statistical basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Components of the CDw18 leukocyte surface glycoprotein complex (Mo1/LFA-1/GP 150,95 or MAC-1, LFA-1 family) are required for some adhesion-related functions of human neutrophils (PMNs). We evaluated the ability of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against specific determinants on the CDw18 glycoproteins to inhibit neutrophil adherence to cultured human endothelial cells (EC) stimulated by a variety of agonists, including thrombin and leukotriene C4, which induce the EC-dependent adhesion of PMNs. MoAb 60.3, an antibody that binds to an epitope common to the 3 heterodimer subunits of the neutrophil CDw18 complex, potently inhibited (90-100%) the rapid (5-30 minute) adherence response stimulated by N-formyl-methyionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, leukotriene B4, platelet-activating factor, phorbol myristate acetate, Ionophore A23187, and tumor necrosis factor. MoAbs directed against epitopes on the alpha polypeptide of the CD11b (Mol, MAC-1) heterodimer also inhibited PMN adherence to EC and to cell-free surfaces induced by these agonists. In contrast, the anti-CDw18 MoAbs had a trivial effect on maximal EC-dependent neutrophil adherence stimulated by thrombin and leukotriene C4, and incompletely inhibited PMN adherence induced by these agonists under submaximal conditions. These findings indicate that there is an alternative mechanism for neutrophil adherence, presumably resulting from molecular alterations of the EC surface, that does not require the PMN CDw18 glycoproteins. They also suggest that the inability to adhere to endothelium may not completely account for the defect in chemotaxis that is observed in vivo in neutrophils that are deficient in the CDw18 complex.\r"

After treatment with oral L-carnitine, 100 mg/kg per d divided every 6 h, plasma carnitine concentrations became normal in all subjects within 2 d. Initial plasma free fatty acid concentrations, inversely related to free carnitine concentrations, were reduced after 7-20 mo of carnitine therapy. Muscle lipid accumulation, which varied directly with duration of carnitine deficiency (r = 0.73), improved significantly in three of seven rebiopsied patients after carnitine therapy. One Lowe's syndrome patient achieved a normal muscle carnitine level after therapy. Muscle carnitine levels remained low in all cystinosis patients, even though cystinotic muscle cells in culture took up L-[3H]carnitine normally. The half-life of plasma carnitine for cystinotic children given a single oral dose approximated 6.3 h; 14% of ingested L-carnitine was excreted within 24 h. Studies in a uremic patient with cystinosis showed that her plasma carnitine was in equilibrium with some larger compartment and may have been maintained by release of carnitine from the muscle during dialysis. Because oral L-carnitine corrects plasma carnitine deficiency, lowers plasma free fatty acid concentrations, and reverses muscle lipid accumulation in some patients, its use as therapy in renal Fanconi syndrome should be considered. However, its efficacy in restoring muscle carnitine to normal, and the optimal dosage regimen, have yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the catabolism of nascent and circulating very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and in the conversion of VLDL to low density lipoproteins (LDL), studies were performed in which LPL activity was inhibited in the cynomolgus monkey by intravenous infusion of inhibitory polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Inhibition of LPL activity resulted in a three- to fivefold increase in plasma triglyceride levels within 3 h. Analytical ultracentrifugation and gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated an increase predominantly in more buoyant, larger VLDL (Sf 400-60). LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels fell during this same time period, whereas triglyceride in LDL and HDL increased. Kinetic studies, utilizing radiolabeled human VLDL, demonstrated that LPL inhibition resulted in a marked decrease in the catabolism of large (Sf 400-100) VLDL apolipoprotein B (apoB). The catabolism of more dense VLDL (Sf 60-20) was also inhibited, although to a lesser extent. However, there was a complete block in the conversion of tracer in both Sf 400-100 and 60-20 VLDL apoB into LDL during LPL inhibition. Similarly, endogenous labeling of VLDL using [3H]leucine demonstrated that in the absence of LPL, no radiolabeled apoB appeared in LDL. We conclude that although catabolism of dense VLDL continues in the absence of LPL, this enzyme is required for the generation of LDL.\r"

In each case collagen fibril organization appeared abnormal by electron microscopy compared with age-matched normal cartilages: fibrils were much thinner, of irregular shape and did not exhibit the characteristic banding pattern. This was associated with the absence (compared with normal cartilage) of the C-propeptide of type II collagen (chondrocalcin) from the extracellular matrix of epiphyseal cartilages, although it was detected (as in normal cartilages) in the lower hypertrophic zone of the growth plate in association with calcifying cartilage. The C-propeptide was abnormally concentrated in intracellular vacuolar sites in Kniest cartilages and its total content was reduced in all cases but not in all cartilages. Moreover, it was not a part of the procollagen molecule. In contrast, type II collagen alpha-chain size was normal, indicating the formation of a triple helix. Also type II collagen content was normal and it was present in extracellular sites and only occasionally detected intracellularly. These observations suggest that the defect in Kniest dysplasia may result from the secretion of type II procollagen lacking the C-propeptide and abnormal fibril formation, and that the C-propeptide is normally required for fibril formation.\r"

Most infected persons harbor latent virus in nerve ganglia for the rest of their lives. True primary infections, nonprimary first-episode infections, and recurrent infections can be asymptomatic or clinical, but all of these are contagious. Past estimates of recurrent herpes affecting 20% to 40% of the population are probably low because of inadequate studies of asymptomatic shedding and genital recurrences. Herpes infections are spread primarily by close personal contact but some are contracted by fomites and medical-dental procedures. Latent virus harbored by almost everyone with frequent reactivation to produce symptomatic or asymptomatic, infectious recurrent disease poses a huge problem for control or eradication of herpes simplex infections. Public health measures will probably fail because they require too much alteration of the public's life-styles. So far, antiviral drugs do not eliminate latent virus from infected ganglia. That naturally infected persons can be reinfected, superinfected, or autoinoculated raises serious questions whether vaccines will eradicate the disease, although they might control some serious manifestations and limit some spreading. The problem of eradicating herpes is different from that of eradicating smallpox, where latent infections with infectious recurrences did not exist.\r"

First-episode infections show more extensive disease, more systemic symptoms, and greater viral shedding than do recurrent infections. Ten percent to 15% of patients with first-episode primary genital herpes have oropharyngeal infections with the same virus strain. Herpesvirus can be isolated from the urethra in about 30% of male patients with first-episode infections. In recurrent vulvar herpes, virus can be isolated from the cervix in 10% to 15% of patients. Many genital lesions that clinically suggest something else turn out to be herpes; herpes may be diagnosed 5% of the time clinically but cultures are positive 14% of the time. Primary genital herpes type 2 infections recur about 95% of the time whereas type 1 infections recur about 50% of the time. Recurrences are highly unpredictable from patient to patient and time to time. The role of asymptomatic shedding in the spread of herpes is a major area for future study. Antiviral treatment is probably going to change the epidemiology of herpetic infections very little.\r"

Preclinical investigation brought the drug to clinical trials in 1977 and the first form of the drug (topical) was available to physicians in 1982. Activity of acyclovir is greatest against herpes 1 and herpes 2, less against varicella zoster, still less against Epstein-Barr, and very little against cytomegalovirus. Acyclovir is an antiviral agent only after it is phosphorylated in infected cells by a viral-induced thymidine kinase. Acyclovir monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate and triphosphate forms by cellular enzymes in the infected host cell where the drug is concentrated. Acyclovir triphosphate inactivates viral deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase. Acyclovir incorporation into the growing viral deoxyribonucleic acid chain causes its termination. The antiviral process has relatively little effect on normal, uninfected cells. An important toxic effect of acyclovir is its potential to cause obstructive nephropathy. The drug is excreted primarily by the kidney, which may require smaller doses in patients with decreased kidney function. Oral dosages of acyclovir as recommended for herpes simplex are probably not adequate for varicella zoster infections.\r"

When viral resistance develops, it does so by changes in these two enzymes. Three possible mechanisms of viral resistance to acyclovir include (1) selection of viral mutants that make little or no thymidine kinase and do not phosphorylate acyclovir adequately, (2) selection of mutants that can phosphorylate thymidine but cannot phosphorylate acyclovir (i.e., these viruses have thymidine kinases with altered substrate specificity), and (3) selection of viruses that have altered DNA polymerases that replicate viral DNA in the presence of acyclovir triphosphate. Thymidine kinase-deficient virus has been isolated from clinical isolates frequently, but few strains appear to be virulent for animals or humans and only a few seem to have caused clinical disease. Viruses with altered substrate specificity have been reported but viruses with an altered DNA polymerase have not occurred in clinical practice. Antiviral drugs should be used only when necessary to minimize the appearance of resistant strains of virus.\r"

Early recognition of infections beginning in skin or mucous membranes is essential because 75% will disseminate internally if untreated. Skin lesions provide important diagnostic clues in herpes of the nervous system and disseminated herpes, but they often appear late and in only about 60% of infected neonates. Acyclovir and vidarabine are effective therapies but they must be administered early to prevent serious damage or death. Herpetic skin lesions in neonates may be confused with pyodermas. Direct immunofluorescence and cultures are reliable diagnostic tests. Congenital herpes may cause widespread skin involvement and multiple eye and nervous system diseases. The mother is the source of neonatal herpes in about two thirds of cases. Asymptomatic genital shedding of virus late in pregnancy does not accurately predict whether maternal cultures will be positive at the time of delivery. The risk of the infant acquiring neonatal herpes from a mother with recurrent herpes at birth is about 5%, but the risk is much higher if the mother has true primary genital infection.\r"

Acyclovir is a prototype of this improved process. Interferon has a beneficial effect against CMV infection in renal transplant patients and has promising results in the treatment of papillomas and rhinovirus infections. It does not seem to be as effective against genital herpes or varicella zoster as acyclovir. Ribavirin is effective against respiratory syncytial virus infections and Lassa fever. Varicella-zoster virus is highly sensitive to bromovinyl deoxyuridine in vitro. Phosphonoformate is effective in herpes simplex in animals but of little clinical benefit topically in human recurrent A2 herpes. Zidovudine may decrease mortality rates and infectious complications in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. DHPG (9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl]guanine is useful in treatment of cytomegalovirus and infection in immunocompromised patients. The prodrug of acyclovir results in high blood levels of acyclovir and shows promise in the treatment of varicella-zoster infections. Many halogenated pyrimidine nucleoside analogs are being developed. Buciclovir is another acyclic guanosine analog effective against herpes simplex virus in vitro. 2'-nor-cyclic guanosine monophosphate has a broad antiviral spectrum of action. Interleukin-2 is being investigated. Combined therapies of two or more antiviral drugs or antiviral drugs and other treatments are being studied.\r"

Tzanck smears are easy to do, inexpensive, and compare favorably with cultures and immunofluorescence tests for specificity and sensitivity, but they require considerable experience to interpret accurately and they cannot differentiate between herpes type 1, herpes type 2, and varicella zoster infections. Biopsies are useful when clues to a diagnosis are being sought. Peroxidase-antiperoxidase and avidin-biotin tests present technical difficulties but interpretational difficulties are low and the results are available in a few hours. They can distinguish between herpes type 1, herpes type 2, and varicella zoster virus, as can immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies. Serologic tests are used primarily to distinguish between primary and recurrent herpes simplex infections. Virus isolation in tissue cultures is the gold standard for identifying herpes simplex virus but it is not 100% specific or 100% sensitive. Restriction endonuclease analysis identifies types and strains of virus by their deoxyribonucleic acid composition and it is very useful in epidemiologic studies. Ability to find virus by whatever method is influenced by the stage of the lesion. As lesions age, less infectivity and antigen result in less sensitivity of the tests.\r"

Analyses using clinical data bases might provide useful information if statistical methods can adequately correct for the lack of randomization. To test this approach, the findings of the three major randomized trials of coronary bypass surgery were compared with predictions of multivariable statistical models derived from observations in the Duke Cardiovascular Disease Databank. Clinical characteristics of patients at Duke University Medical Center who met eligibility requirements for each major randomized trial were used in the models to predict 5 year survival rates expected for medical and surgical therapy in each randomized trial. Model predictions agreed well with randomized trial results and were within the 95% confidence limits of the observed survival rates in 24 (92%) of 26 clinical subgroups. The overall correlation between predicted and observed survival rates was good (Spearman coefficient 0.73, p less than 0.0001). These results suggest that carefully performed analyses of observational data can complement the results of randomized trials.\r"

All patients were receiving cyclosporine and methylprednisolone orally. At early catheterization, right heart pressures as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure still remained above normal values in the majority of patients. Systemic arterial hypertension was already present in 29% of the patients and cardiac index was usually in the normal range, without any inotropic support. Results of late catheterization showed continuing improvement with return of right heart pressures to normal values in most but not all patients. Systemic arterial hypertension was noted in nearly all patients and is likely to be the result of hypervolemia secondary to cyclosporine-induced sodium retention. The increase in cardiac index, which was above normal values in 39% of the patients, was also consistent with hypervolemia in the setting of cardiac denervation. Thus, cardiac function at rest is satisfactory at short- and long-term assessment after cardiac transplantation, but the development and persistence of systemic arterial hypertension associated with cyclosporine use are a matter of concern in such patients.\r"

Antitachycardia pacing and automatic defibrillation have been severely limited by the poor specificity of tachycardia discrimination in commercially available devices. Although absolute heart rate has been the principal means of automatic diagnosis, several new detection algorithms and methods are being investigated. Multiple electrode timing comparison, signal processing and pattern recognition are employed in these newer techniques. Although each offers some improvement over present technology, none is capable of identifying all arrhythmias. The methods employing comparison of atrial and ventricular rates, without additional criteria, are unable to detect ventricular tachycardia in the presence of 1:1 retrograde conduction. Electrographic analysis techniques require very stable electrodes and may not tolerate normal morphologic variations. A combination of two or more approaches may ultimately be required. All techniques will require that certain critical variables be programmable to allow for individualization in each clinical situation. Soft-ware-controllable devices and those capable of sensing from both the atria and the ventricles will provide the sophistication necessary for the implementation of complex tachycardia detection algorithms. This report reviews automatic tachycardia detection techniques in current use and under investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Each cardiac cycle can be characterized by a pressure-volume loop that graphically depicts the external work of the ventricle. The pressure-volume loop is determined to a large extent by end-diastolic and end-systolic conditions, each of which reflects the properties of the heart and circulation at these two critical times in the cardiac cycle. The pressure and volume at end-diastole and end-systole, in turn, are determined by interactions between the heart and the circulation. End-diastolic pressure and volume reflect preload (venous return) and the lusitropic (relaxation) state of the ventricular walls, and end-systolic pressure and volume are determined by the afterload (peripheral and pulmonary resistance) and the inotropic (contractile) state of the myocardium. Alterations in inotropic and lusitropic state lead to predictable changes in the pressure-volume loop that, when combined with knowledge of preload and afterload, can facilitate understanding of the pharmacologic and pathophysiologic responses of the heart.\r"

  ".W": "Allergen inhalation in the laboratory can lead to an early (0 to 2 hours) and late (3 to 12 hours) asthmatic response and an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness to a variety of bronchoconstrictor mediators. Also, environmental allergen exposure increases airway responsiveness, symptoms of asthma, and the amount of treatment needed to control symptoms. Allergen inhalation causes an acute inflammatory response with an influx of predominantly neutrophils and/or eosinophils into the airway in both animal preparations and sensitized human subjects. The development of airway hyperresponsiveness is most likely a consequence of the inflammatory response. The mediators involved in initiating the inflammatory response or airway hyperresponsiveness have not yet been clearly identified. However, potent chemotactic factors, such as leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor can initiate both airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. In addition, in some animal preparations, cyclooxygenase products of arachidonate metabolism, possibly thromboxane, play a central role in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness after inhalation of inflammatory stimuli such as allergen.\r"

Extensive studies of the mechanisms of action of two of these chemicals, ozone and toluene diisocyanate, have been conducted during the past decade. The results of these studies suggest that acute airway inflammation plays an important role in the effect of inhaled chemicals but that the specific aspects of the inflammatory response that lead to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness are different for different stimuli and among different mammalian species. These observations suggest that in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness can arise via several different mechanisms and is thus not likely to reflect a single underlying defect.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium (Ca) ions play an important pathophysiologic role in allergic reactions. Thus, mediator release from mast cells, synthesis of some newly formed chemical mediators, airway smooth muscle contraction, and nerve-impulse conduction are all dependent on the availability and flux of Ca ions. It is likely, therefore, that Ca antagonists would modify allergic bronchoconstriction. In vitro, Ca antagonists have been demonstrated to inhibit mediator release (histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, and platelet-activating factor) from mast cells, passively sensitized human lung fragments, and leukocytes. Ca antagonists have also been found to inhibit synthesis of leukotrienes in rat lungs and cyclooxygenase products in sheep, possibly by inactivating phospholipase A2 and/or 5-lipoxygenase. In addition, nifedipine, verapamil, and gallopamil have demonstrated inhibition of airway smooth muscle contractions to histamine, carbachol, and antigen in various species. In vivo effects of Ca antagonists are variable, depending on the species, experimental design, the stimulus or the agonist, and the Ca antagonist used. Animal studies have demonstrated the inhibition of histamine, methacholine, citric acid, and prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs and dogs by intravenous nifedipine. In contrast, verapamil inhibited antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in allergic sheep without any effect on histamine- and carbachol-induced responses. Ca antagonists (nifedipine and verapamil) have been of limited value in human subjects and generally have no significant bronchodilating activity. Both nifedipine and verapamil prevent the exercise-induced asthma and partly attenuate the histamine and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Oral nifedipine is generally more effective than oral verapamil against acute antigen-induced bronchoconstriction; however, this efficacy may be limited by systemic side effects. Inhaled Ca antagonists may be more effective and free of systemic side effects, as demonstrated by greater efficacy of inhaled verapamil. A new Ca antagonist, gallopamil (a methoxy derivative of verapamil), is being investigated as an aerosol, and preliminary studies in animals and humans have found it fourfold to seventeenfold more potent than verapamil. In sheep, gallopamil has been found to attenuate histamine, carbachol, and platelet-activating factor-induced bronchoconstriction, as well as to inhibit early and late-phase allergic airway responses. Studies in human subjects have also demonstrated the inhibition of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction by inhaled gallopamil, with efficacy comparable or better than cromolyn sodium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of oral gold in asthma, 20 patients with steroid-dependent asthma received auranofin at a dose of 3 mg by mouth, twice daily, in a 24-week open clinical trial. Prospective evaluation of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was determined before and 8 and 16 weeks after initiation of auranofin therapy. Serial spirometry (FEV1 and FVC), lung volumes, and diffusing capacities (single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lungs) were measured before and at 10 and 20 weeks after treatment. All subjects were required to record concomitant medications, symptom scores, and morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates. In vitro immunologic studies performed before and after 8 and 20 weeks of auranofin therapy included leukocyte histamine release in response to antihuman IgE, lymphocyte blast transformation in response to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, and leukocyte inhibitory factor activity in response to Candida albicans and tetanus toxoid antigens. In 18 patients evaluated, there were no significant differences between baseline and posttreatment spirometry, single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lungs, and lung volumes. At week 16 of treatment, the steroid cumulative dose or the total prednisone dose administered from 7 days before through 10 days after each methacholine test day decreased from a mean of 293 +/- 125 mg at baseline to 192 +/- 115 mg. At week 16, nine of 18 patients (50%) exhibited decreased methacholine responsiveness as defined by a more than one-half log10 increase in the concentration of methacholine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1. A significant correlation (r = 0.60) was observed between the increase in the concentration of methacholine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 and the decrease in steroid cumulative dose after 16 weeks of treatment. Leukocyte histamine release to anti-IgE exhibited significant reductions from baseline at week 20 to 10(-2) (p less than 0.002) and at 10(-3) (p less than 0.005) dilutions. At week 20, leukocyte inhibitory factor activity in response to Candida increased from baseline at the 0.1 mg per well (p = 0.025) and 1 mg per well (p = 0.05) concentrations; similarly, the responses to tetanus toxoid increased at the 1 mg per well (p less than 0.05) and 0.1 mg per well (p less than 0.01) concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These symptoms do not necessarily imply the presence of psychiatric disorder, nor do they indicate that allergic processes have a direct effect on cerebral function. These changes are the indirect result of the allergy and are usually secondary to extracerebral physical dysfunctions. The potential importance of the cerebral effects of hypoxemia in asthma, and of the central nervous system side effects of antiallergy medication, has received inadequate attention and requires more research. Failure to recognize the true significance of such valid clinical observations, combined with failure to recognize the importance of the use of techniques to overcome the effects of the placebo, suggestion, and observer bias have led to several misconceptions concerning the role of foods and inhalants in psychiatric and somatic syndromes unassociated with atopy. It is apparent that publicity directed to such views, and the use of unorthodox or unproven \"allergy\" procedures, can cause significant harm.\r"

In 10 patients' homes, indoor sampling was performed by open-plate culture, house dust culture, and swab culture (group 1), but in the other 12 patients' homes, sampling was only by house dust culture (group 2). We isolated 302 strains of yeasts from the 22 patients' homes and 962 strains of yeasts from the homes of control subjects. The incidence of yeasts, except genera Trichosporon, was not significantly different between homes of patients and control subjects when homes were assessed by three culture methods. T. cutaneum was isolated from seven of 10 patients' homes in group 1, and their colonizing places were revealed by the swab culture method. In group 2, the cells were isolated from four of 12 patients' homes. No T. cutaneum, however, was isolated from the control subjects' homes. Among the isolated yeasts from patients' homes, 23 strains were reactive to the patients' sera at 1:128 or higher in indirect fluorescent antibody titers; 10 yeasts were T. cutaneum, isolated from 10 homes of 14 patients, but the other 13 yeasts were each a different species isolated from 10 different homes. Furthermore, inhalation challenge with the culture-filtrate antigen prepared from T. cutaneum was performed on the nine patients of six homes in group 1 and the two asymptomatic family members. Of the nine patients, six were positive, one was probable, and two patients were negative. Neither of the two asymptomatic family members responded. These results suggest that T. cutaneum is a major causative agent of summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\r"

  ".W": "The case report presented is clinically compatible with late onset HD. The diagnosis was initially obscured by a lack of family history due to the early death of both parents and siblings. The presence of symptoms at the age of 59 in one offspring is consistent with the intrafamilial transmission of late onset HD disease. The early neuropsychometric data were consistent with the cognitive changes of HD, particularly with the loss of higher cognitive functions, memory and the relative decline in the performance IQ with the preservation of language skills. The psychiatric symptoms of emotional lability and apathy were also congruent with the diagnosis of HD. The atypical features of this patient's course, including progressively severe dementia, seizures and rigidity, may have provided clinical clues to the coexistence of both AD and HD. The absence of caudate atrophy on serial CT scans in this patient, although inconsistent with the gross findings reported on postmortem exam, perhaps could be explained by the 3 1/2-year interval between the last CT scan and death. Further, it has been noted previously that pathological changes tend to lag behind the clinical manifestations of the disease. The pathologic findings on autopsy were confirmatory for the presence of both AD and HD in this patient. Genetic counseling for this family is now most appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "In a variety of lymphocyte interactions, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) plays an important role as an accessory mechanism mediating cell adhesion. We tested the possibility that LFA-1 could also be involved in the specific binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules (HEV) during homing. Antibodies against LFA-1 but not against various other cell surface molecules (except the putative gp90 homing receptor defined by the MEL-14 antibody) were found to inhibit in vitro adherence of lymphocytes to HEV in frozen sections of lymph nodes. Binding of T cell lines to HEV was also inhibited by anti-LFA-1 antibody. Using sublines selected for differential expression of the MEL-14 antigen, MEL-14 high cells (which bind well to HEV) were less susceptible to inhibition by anti-LFA-1 than poor binders with low levels of the homing receptor, supporting the model of LFA-1 being an accessory mechanism strengthening weak interactions between cells. Parallel results were found in vivo where anti-LFA-1 antibodies reduced the migration of normal lymphocytes into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches by 40 to 60%. Localization in the lung, especially of activated lymphocytes, was also impaired, although to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that LFA-1 plays an accessory role in cellular interactions relevant for lymphocyte migration.\r"

In spleen colony-forming unit assays, Dm2 as hosts consistently supported a smaller number of colonies than did BALB/c-Kh. However, both Dm2 and BALB/c-Kh supported a comparable number of colonies in in vitro granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit and erythroid colony-forming unit assays. These observations together suggest that the mutation in Dm2 has not affected the hemopoietic potential of the stem cells but may probably affect the hemopoietic microenvironment for the development of the stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "CD4+ T cells in the mouse have recently been subdivided into two major subpopulations which differ in their functional activities and in the lymphokines they produce. Although cloned T cells lines representative of both sets will activate B cells in polyclonal responses, only the subset producing interleukin 4 (IL-4) will activate antigen-specific B cells in linked recognition assays. This suggested that IL-4 was essential for such responses. In the present experiments, the requirements were compared for B cell activation in specific as opposed to polyclonal antibody responses by T cell clones of the helper (IL-4 producing) subset. It was found that specific responses involve primarily small B cells, whereas polyclonal responses activate exclusively the large B cells. Second, polyclonal B cell responses can proceed in the absence of T:B contact, whereas specific responses require physical interaction of the two cells. Third, it was found that interleukin 5 (IL-5, formerly known as T cell replacing factor/B cell growth factor II) is essential for these polyclonal responses by inhibition of such responses with monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody. Anti-IL-5 also inhibits specific antibody responses involving direct T:B interaction. Thus, IL-5 is clearly a critical mediator of differentiation to immunoglobulin secretion of activated B cells, whether such B cells are obtained as large B cells from freshly isolated spleen cells or are initially activated in an IL-4-dependent fashion by cognate interaction by a helper T cell clone.\r"

Furthermore, these CD4+ lymphocytes coexpress CD8 and NKH1. The NK function of cloned H. ateles-immortalized lymphocyte populations is proportional to the extent to which they express the CD8 antigen. These studies illustrate an interesting example of restricted viral tropism and may indicate a potentially useful means of generating phenotypically stable, functionally competent, cloned lymphocyte populations for study.\r"

  ".W": "Upon activation, lymphocytes display profound alterations in their in vivo migration behavior. In an attempt to understand some of the cellular mechanisms responsible for this altered behavior, in vitro stimulated lymphocytes have been analyzed for their expression of a putative homing receptor (HOR) (defined by mAb MEL-14) and for their ability to bind to specialized lymphoid organ high endothelial venules (HEV) in vitro. The results indicate that signals related to lymphocyte activation induce complex alterations in HOR expression and organ-specificity of HEV-binding: 1) submitogenic stimuli induce an increase in MEL-14 antigen expression. This applies to almost all lymphocytes in autologous cultures, for the fraction of cells in periodate, LPS- or Con A-treated cultures not fully activated and for cultures stimulated with suboptimal doses of Con A. 2) Full blast transformation is associated with a decrease or complete loss of MEL-14 antigen expression on the majority of blasts in all activating systems used, but a subset of up to 30 to 40% of fully activated cells may nonetheless express very high levels of the MEL-14 antigen. 3) Functional assays reveal that Con A and periodate stimulation lead to a selective, nearly complete suppression of the lymphocytes binding to HEV of Peyer's patches, even under conditions where overall binding to peripheral node HEV is increased. This indicates a differential regulation of the two respective receptors, with the mucosa system-specific HOR being more prone to down-regulation during in vitro activation by these mitogens.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of spontaneous activation of B cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was analyzed by using anti-class II monoclonal antibodies in vitro. B cells from SLE patients showed enhanced proliferation and Ig production by in vitro culture without any stimulation. The number of Ig-producing cells increased during a 5-day culture period, but the addition of anti-class II antibodies such as anti-HLA-DR, DQ, or DP monoclonal antibodies inhibited these B cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. Anti-class I and anti-B1 antibody gave no effect. The inhibitory effect of anti-class II antibodies on B cell responses became more remarkable when B cells were cultured on a longer period. By a Percoll gradient density centrifugation, Ig-producing cells were enriched in the lower density fraction, but became depleted in the higher density fraction. However, B cells of the higher density fraction developed into Ig-producing cells after 5 days of culture and anti-class II antibodies inhibited this development. When mitomycin C- and cycloheximide-treated B cells were added to the in vitro culture of B cells as a stimulator, B cell responses were enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. T cells treated with mitomycin C and cycloheximide had no enhancing effect on B cell responses. Furthermore, the enhancing effect of the stimulator B cells was inhibited by the pretreatment of stimulator B cells with anti-class II antibodies. These results suggest that in patients with SLE the abnormality exists in B precursor cells which are easily activated by interacting with other B cells to differentiate into Ig-producing cells and anti-class II antibodies inhibit the B cell activation by interfering with this cellular interaction.\r"

A lamb model of lentivirus-induced lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, comparable to lymphoid interstitial pneumonia associated with pediatric AIDS, was used to investigate production of leukocyte-soluble mediators. Lentivirus-infected lambs and adult sheep with severe lymphoid interstitial pneumonia had significantly elevated levels of spontaneous interferon (IFN) production from pulmonary leukocytes compared with ovine lentiviruses-infected animals with mild or no lesions of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia or non-infected controls. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from lentivirus-infected lambs did not spontaneously release significant amounts of IFN. IFN production by pulmonary lymph node lymphocytes was enhanced in the presence of lentivirus-infected alveolar macrophages. Animals with lentivirus-induced disease and spontaneous IFN production had enhanced virus replication within tissues. The ovine lentiviruses-induced IFN had a m.w. of between 25,000 and 35,000 and was resistant to freeze/thawing procedures. The IFN activity was sensitive to trypsin and stable to low pH and heat. IFN with similar physical and biochemical properties was produced when ovine lentiviruses was added to control leukocyte cultures. IL-2 and PGE2 production and responses to mitogen by pulmonary lymph node lymphocytes of lentivirus-diseased lambs were not statistically different from control animals. Increased local production of IFN in lentivirus-infected host tissues may serve to accelerate the entry of leukocytes into virus-induced lesions promoting cell-mediated tissue damage and also provide increased numbers of cells for virus replication.\r"

  ".U": "88116696\r", 
  ".W": "Two mAb were used to develop new techniques for the purification and quantitation of the major feline salivary allergen, Felis domesticus allergen I (Fel d I). The allergen was purified from aqueous house dust extract with a high Fel d I content by affinity chromatography over a monoclonal immunosorbent and elution with 4 mM HCl, pH 2.5. This single step procedure gave 40 to 50% recovery of 90% pure allergen which, following final purification by size exclusion HPLC, showed a single line on immunodiffusion and crossed immunoelectrophoresis against monospecific anti-Fel d I and polyclonal anti-cat dander antibodies. The m.w. of native Fel d I was 39,000 on size exclusion HPLC, and 17,000 under nonreducing conditions on gel electrophoresis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (33 residues) showed no homology with other known protein sequences. The combination of the SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequence data suggests that Fel d I is a non-covalently linked homodimer. A two-site RIA was developed using mAb directed against different epitopes on Fel d I. This assay was species-specific, highly sensitive (0.0004 U/ml), and showed an excellent correlation with a polyclonal inhibition RIA (n = 27, r = 0.93, p less than 0.001). Cat allergen extracts used for immediate skin tests showed marked differences in Fel d I content (from 0.1 to 30 U/ml). Consistently high Fel d I levels were found at monthly intervals in six dust samples from four houses with cats (10 to 100 U/g of dust). Comparisons of Fel d I and mite and pollen allergen levels showed that house dust can contain greater than 100 micrograms/g of either of these allergens and is a potent source of foreign environmental antigens. Monoclonal affinity chromatography provides a major breakthrough in the purification of Fel d I, from a source material that would otherwise have been considered impossible (house dust). The mAb assay for Fel d I is both more sensitive and more easily standardized than existing techniques. These techniques will allow full structural and antigenic analysis of Fel d I and more detailed studies on the relationship between cat antigen exposure and the development of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of surface fluorescence with flow cytometry has revealed the presence of membrane-associated interleukin 2 (IL-2) epitopes on the surface of long term human T cell clones. These IL-2 epitopes could not be accounted for by soluble IL-2 binding to its specific receptor or adsorbing nonspecifically to the cells. The level of surface IL-2 antigenic determinants on the T cell clones was decreased in the presence of phorbol esters and increased in the absence of an exogenous source of IL-2. It was completely lost upon stimulation of the clones to produce the soluble lymphokine. Surface IL-2 epitopes were also detected on the Jurkat tumor cell line which secretes IL-2 upon stimulation and on another T cell tumor line MOLT 4. MLA-144 produces IL-2 constitutively; however, it did not possess membrane-associated epitopes. Tumor lines of other lineages were negative. A subpopulation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes demonstrated some membrane-bound IL-2, whereas non-T peripheral blood mononuclear cells were negative. Thus, cells with the potential of producing and secreting IL-2 upon stimulation possessed the surface epitopes of the lymphokine and cells either actively secreting IL-2 or without the potential for secretion were negative for surface expression. Membrane-associated IL-2 antigenic determinants appear to represent a T lymphocytic surface marker of potential cellular function. The relationship of this marker to the secreted lymphokine is not known. Although it is possible that the epitopes seen were present on a distinct molecule independent of secreted IL-2, the distribution on a variety of T cells and regulation via cellular activation suggest that the surface expression of IL-2 epitopes is in some way related to the soluble lymphokine.\r"

Both TNF alpha and TNF beta induced fibroblasts to produce stimulators of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar results were seen when equivalent concentrations of TNF alpha and TNF beta were used. Prior incubation of the TNF alpha and TNF beta with their respective antibodies inactivated the ability of the TNF preparations to induce the release of granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential colony-stimulating activity from fibroblasts. In addition, incubation of the TNF-induced fibroblast supernatant with antibody before colony assay resulted in enhanced colony formation, suggesting that the TNF carried over into the colony assay suppressed colony formation. Additional proof of this suppression by TNF was evident when TNF was added directly to the CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM colony assays. IL-1 does not appear to function as an intermediary in growth factor production by fibroblasts stimulated with TNF because antibody to IL-1 displayed no effect. Furthermore, assay of TNF-induced fibroblast supernatant was negative for IL-1. These results suggest that TNF alpha and TNF beta exert both a positive and negative influence on in vitro hemopoietic colony formation.\r"

  ".W": "Two bone marrow stromal cell lines isolated from the adherent layer of a Dexter-type long term bone marrow culture differ markedly in their hemopoietic support capacity. S17 supports myelopoiesis and the differentiation of early B cell precursors into B lymphocytes while S10 supports myeloid cell differentiation and not B lymphopoiesis. The identification of a stromal cell line with B cell support capacity prompted an investigation of whether the effects of S17 were mediated via soluble factors. Results presented herein indicate that medium conditioned by S17 but not S10 contains an activity that can induce the expression of the 220,000 m.w. 14.8 antigen and cytoplasmic mu H chain of Ig in B lymphocyte progenitors that have not yet expressed these markers. Bone marrow cells were depleted of 14.8+, cytoplasmic mu+ pre-B cells on antibody-coated petri dishes. After 24-h liquid culture newly generated pre-B cells were enumerated as cells that expressed cytoplasmic mu H chain of Ig but not Ig L chains by immunofluorescence. Expression of Ly5(220) was monitored by 14.8 antibody binding. This pre-B cell differentiation activity was abrogated by digestion with pronase, aminopeptidase, or carboxypeptidase. Isoelectric focusing data revealed the activity to have isoelectric point of 5.9 to 6.2. S17-conditioned medium was fractionated using HPLC and each fraction tested for pre-B cell-generating activity. Fractions collected from a Superose 12 gel filtration column were found to have two peaks of activity associated with molecules of apparent m.w. of approximately 60,000 and 10,000. Virtually identical peaks of activity were observed when medium conditioned by heterogeneous stromal cell cultures was fractionated. Separation of S10-conditioned medium revealed no cryptic activity. S17-conditioned medium was further characterized by anion exchange chromatography and the majority of the pre-B cell generating activity shown to be associated with the void volume that eluted from a MonoQ column. These fractions were rechromatographed on Superose and the activity again found to be associated with two fractions corresponding to apparent m.w. of 60,000 and 10,000. The S17 pre-B cell differentiation activity appears to result from the presence of a novel molecule because other well characterized mediators had no activity in this short-term liquid culture system. No pre-B cell-generating activity was observed when IL-1 or conditioned medium containing IL-2, IL-3, or IL-4 (B cell stimulatory factor 1) were added to cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role that extracellular calcium plays in activating resting cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to proliferate and to produce lymphokines was examined. In these cells, stimulation with interleukin 2 (IL-2) induced a proliferative response without a concomitant production of macrophage-activating factor (MAF), whereas stimulation with antigen or lectin (in the absence of IL-2) induced MAF production but not proliferation. In the case of IL-2-induced proliferation, extracellular calcium was required to initiate proliferation as well as to prevent cellular arrest later in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle. In MAF production extracellular calcium was required both to activate the phosphatidylinositol signal-transducing mechanism and to mobilize intracellular calcium in antigen- or lectin-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Further, extracellular calcium was required for only 8 of the 18 hr of stimulation time which was needed to achieve maximal MAF production, indicating that both calcium-dependent and -independent events exist in the signal pathway. Additional experiments with calcium ionophores and activators of protein kinase C indicated that although both intracellular calcium mobilization and de novo protein phosphorylation are involved in MAF production, an optimal increase in the level of intracellular calcium by itself is insufficient to induce the production of this lymphokine.\r"

  ".W": "Immunization of rabbits with Streptococcus mutans antigens results in the production of serum antibodies that bind in vitro to human, rabbit, and monkey cardiac muscle. Antibodies to heart, however, have also been reported to occur at lower titers in the sera of unimmunized rabbits. In this study, the specificities of heart-reactive antibodies (HRA) in sera of unimmunized and S. mutans-immunized rabbits were compared using indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot, and Bio-Dot immunoassays. Both groups of sera gave striational indirect immunofluorescence-staining patterns on thin sections of native human and monkey cardiac muscle. Western blot analyses revealed that antibodies in normal sera bound 9 to 20 components of human, rabbit, and monkey heart. The major bands had Mr of 205,000, 160,000, 135,000, and 70,000. Several of the normal sera did not have antibody activity to S. mutans antigens, indicating that these HRA do not cross-react with these bacteria. Although immunization of rabbits with S. mutans caused increased titers of HRA (two to three doubling dilutions), Western blot assays using anti-S. mutans sera showed banding patterns qualitatively similar to those of normal sera on heart extracts. Antibodies to skeletal muscle myosin were detected in both serum groups. Of eighteen normal rabbit sera sixteen had antimyosin titers of 10 to 40, whereas all eighteen anti-S. mutans sera had titers of 10 to 160. Affinity-purified antimyosin antibodies isolated from anti-S. mutans serum did not bind to S. mutans components. Conversely, affinity-purified antibodies to S. mutans antigens did not bind to myosin or to other cardiac muscle components. Among these were antibodies to the 185-kDa cell wall protein (also known as B, I/II, IF, Spa A, and P1) previously believed to possess antigenic mimicry. HRA were removed from anti-S. mutans sera by absorption with S. mutans but this effect was not specific, because a non-cross-reactive internal standard antibody was also absorbed to the same extent. Because previous evidence for antigenic mimicry between S. mutans and cardiac muscle was based on serum cross-absorption experiments, this immunologic relationship is not substantiated. These results indicated that naturally occurring antibodies to cardiac muscle components are present in the sera of unimmunized rabbits and that immunization with S. mutans does not stimulate production of new heart-reactive antibody, but rather serves to boost antibody production by preexisting clones of self-reactive B-lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of mRNA for IFN-beta 2/B cell differentiation factor2/hepatocyte-stimulating factor (IFN-beta 2) in confluent quiescent cultures of human diploid fibroblasts (FS-4 strain) are enhanced by TNF, IL-1 alpha and beta, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and IFN-beta 1. Of these cytokines, IL-1 alpha and beta cause a particularly strong increase in the accumulation of IFN-beta 2 mRNA in fibroblasts. We have evaluated whether the IFN-beta 2 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by using nuclear run-on transcription assays. We observed that the IFN-beta 2 gene is transcribed at a low level in uninduced FS-4 cells and that this transcriptional activity is increased 2- to 3-fold in cycloheximide-treated cells, 20- to 35-fold in IL-1 alpha-treated cells, and 5- to 15-fold in TNF-treated cells. PDGF and IFN-beta 1 enhance transcription across the IFN-beta 2 gene 2- to 3-fold. The enhancing effect of IL-1 alpha on IFN-beta 2 gene transcription, but not that of TNF, PDGF, or IFN-beta 1, is inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that newly-synthesized protein is involved in the increase in IFN-beta 2 transcription in response to IL-1 alpha but not in the response to the other stimuli. Furthermore, the enhancement of IFN-beta 2 transcription is sustained for up to 14 h after IL-1 alpha induction but is transient and declines to base line levels within 6 h after TNF addition. These observations suggest that there are important differences in the mechanisms by which IL-1 alpha and TNF increase IFN-beta 2 gene transcription in fibroblasts.\r"

  ".U": "88116725\r", 
  ".W": "The T11 (CD2) antigen has been found to be an alternate pathway for antigen-independent activation of resting T cells. T11 triggering also results in activation of NK cells and enhancement of their cytolytic function. The present studies were carried out to further define the mechanisms whereby cytotoxicity is enhanced after T11 activation. A series of clonal human NK cell lines were analyzed after incubation with monoclonal anti-T112 and anti-T113 antibodies specific for different epitopes of the CD2 protein. Anti-T112/3 triggering resulted in increased cytotoxicity against a variety of target cells. Similar results were obtained with F(ab')2 fragments of anti-T112/3, indicating that this effect was not mediated through binding of FcR. The induction of cytotoxicity was found to be associated with increased formation of effector cell-target cell conjugates and with release of secretory granule-localized 35S-labeled proteoglycans. Both enhanced conjugate formation and cytotoxicity could be blocked by anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) mAb. Ultrastructural analysis of NK cells after T11 activation demonstrated increased adherence of effector cells to targets and other NK cells as well as a directional reorientation of cytoplasm and intracellular granules toward the area of contact between cells. Discharge of granules occurred into pockets bounded by closely apposed plasma membranes. In the presence of anti-LFA-1 and anti-T112/3, the close apposition and formation of pockets between effector cells and target cells did not occur but the cells exocytosed their intracellular granules. T11 activation of NK cloned cells also resulted in the formation of the homotypic conjugates and autocytotoxicity. As seen with resistant allogeneic targets, autocytotoxicity was mediated by F(ab')2 fragments of T112/3 antibodies and could be blocked by anti-LFA-1 antibody. Ultrastructural analysis of NK cloned cells after T11 activation confirmed the presence of homotypic conjugates with reorientation of effector cells toward one another and discharge of cytolytic granules into pockets formed between NK cloned cells. Taken together, these results indicate that T11-induced cytolytic function of NK cells is, in part, mediated through increased binding of effector cells and targets and that enhanced conjugate formation is at least in part mediated by the LFA-1 antigen. In addition, T11 activation results in the triggering of the cytolytic mechanism of NK cells and the exocytosis of cytolytic granules and their constituents.\r"

IgM anti-IgE antibodies were found exclusively in cold urticaria (two of nine patients, 22%). Heating of these sera increased the binding to IgE, suggesting immune complex formation. Several positive sera were capable of inducing histamine release from normal peripheral basophils and caused a wheal-flare response upon intradermal injection. Sera containing such autoantibodies from three cold urticaria patients were studied for passive transfer of cold sensitivity. One serum containing IgG anti-IgE gave a strongly positive transfer test at 5 h but not 48 h, suggesting a pathogenic role for the IgG.\r"

A method is described whereby about 85% of a radiolabeled bacterial inoculum was consistently introduced into the bronchopulmonary tree of a mouse by the intratracheal route. Mice were then killed 1 and 4 hours later; their lungs were removed aseptically and homogenized, and viable bacteria and radiolabel counts were determined. Radiolabel counts fell slowly, and more than 80% of the original radiolabel was still present in homogenized lung samples from animals sacrificed 4 hours after challenge. Bacteria/isotope ratios for the bacterial inoculum and homogenized lung samples from animals sacrificed immediately after challenge were very similar. Bacterial clearance values were the same whether computed from bacterial counts alone or according to a radiolabel ratio method whereby the change in the bacteria/isotope ratio in ground lung aliquots was divided by a similar ratio from bacteria used to inoculate animals. Some contamination resulted from oral streptococci being swept into the bronchopulmonary free during the aspiration process. This contamination was not a problem when penicillin was incorporated into the agar and penicillin-resistant strains were used for the bacterial challenges.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of exogenous molecules and transcapillary flux by studying the intravascular and tissue content and the histologic distribution of Evans blue in guinea pigs. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that 87% of the decline in intravascular Evans blue during the first 3 hours after administration was a result of transvascular flux to tissue compartments. Rapidly and slowly equilibrating compartments were identified. Greater than 90% of the clearances in lung and heart were rapid compartment clearances. Histologically, the distribution of Evans blue in these tissues was predominantly extracellular and similar to the distribution of fluorescein-labeled dextran. By contrast, the accumulation in kidney and liver was kinetically similar to characteristics of the slowly equilibrating compartment. This corresponded histologically to the predominant intracellular uptake of Evans blue in these tissues. Generalized increases in capillary permeability were produced by endotoxin or histamine infusion. Both treatments were associated with a more rapid initial decline in intravascular content of Evans blue than was found in control animals. Although the histologic distribution of Evans blue in tissues was not altered, endotoxin was associated with a more rapid appearance of Evans blue in the lung and heart than was seen in controls. We conclude that the initial decline in intravascular content of Evans blue corresponds to the intercompartmental clearance and to transcapillary macromolecular flux. The initial decline in serum concentrations may therefore be useful in studying disorders of generalized capillary permeability. Furthermore, the initial accrual of Evans blue in the lung and heart may be used as a marker of transcapillary macromolecular flux in those tissues.\r"

To include 2N and 4N megakaryocytes in the ploidy distribution histograms, all megakaryocytes were identified by serial immunologic labelling with rabbit antiserum to human platelet glycoproteins and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igG. Cell nuclei were concurrently Feulgen stained with bis-aminophenyl-oxdiazole, and the nuclear fluorescent signals were quantified photometrically. A modal megakaryocyte ploidy value of 32N was seen in 10 of the 13 persons with normal platelet counts, and geometric mean megakaryocyte ploidy values averaged 24.9N +/- 7.0N (arithmetic mean +/- SD). In these normal control individuals, 2N and 4N megakaryocytes accounted for 11.1% of all megakaryocytes, and 2.6% of the megakaryocytes were 128N. Shifts to a higher mean ploidy were observed in five of seven patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, resulting from increased percentages of 64N and 128N megakaryocytes at the expense of 4N, 8N, and 16N cells. Shifts to lower ploidy were demonstrated in two patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient each with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and isoimmune thrombocytopenia. Four of five patients with essential thrombocythemia had strikingly abnormal megakaryocyte ploidy histograms characterized by the presence of unusually high ploidy 256N and 512N megakaryocytes. These 256N and 512N cells were virtually unique to the patients with essential thrombocythemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Antibodies produced by two of the established hybridoma clones were characterized. The Ka of the antibodies was 0.22 x 10(9) L/mol and 0.3 x 10(8) L/mol. in Western blot analysis, both monoclonal antibodies reacted with the purified antigen that had a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 30 kd, but minor components of Mr 27 kd, 56 kd, and 62 kd were also identified. In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions, the purified protein yielded three polypeptides (Mrs of 16.4 kd, 16.8 kd, and 18.3 kd) that did not react with the monoclonal antibodies in Western blot analysis. By immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, PP5 was localized to the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and endothelium of early and late pregnancy placenta tissues, whereas various other tissues were PP5-negative. In immunofluorescence staining, isolated endothelial cells were stained with both monoclonal antibodies. Endothelial cells in monolayer culture released into the medium a substance that is immunologically similar to purified PP5.\r"

Increasing life expectancy and more liberal use of estrogen to prevent postmenopausal bone loss will probably increase the magnitude of the problem. Endometrial cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Good prognosis is associated with obesity and estrogen use and with carcinomas preceded by precancerous hyperplasia. A bad prognosis may be found in women without major risk factors and is associated with a normal or atrophic endometrium. Because of a high prevalence of asymptomatic disease (6.9 per 1,000) and because the group with a poor prognosis is usually asymptomatic, all postmenopausal women should be screened at least one time. For screening, the use of one of the cytologic instruments is recommended; these instruments are safe, easy to handle, and can be used in the office setting without anesthesia. Yields are comparable to dilation and curettage. Family physicians are encouraged to familiarize themselves with cytologic instruments and to use them for screening postmenopausal women in their office.\r"

We now argue that the operational criteria of the DSM-IIIs do not enhance the study of this putative disease entity, but rather thwart this goal by restricting the diagnosis so severely that too few cases will be found to test the third psychosis hypothesis. We suggest revised criteria that will retain the essential features of the traditional concept while defining explicit criteria in the style of the DSM-IIIs.\r"

Although seven patients had lesions restricted to the right hemisphere, four had bilateral or midline damage and one had a left hemisphere lesion. Damage to structures functionally connected to the obitofrontal cortex, mainly in the right hemisphere, seems to be associated with secondary mania. The possible roles of monoaminergic, genetic, and perinatal factors in the pathogenesis of secondary mania are discussed.\r"

Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to SAF protein was reacted with brain sections from scrapie-infected mice, two familial cases of transmissible dementia, and three cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific immunostaining of cerebral amyloid plaques occurred in the scrapie-infected mice and in the two familial cases of transmissible dementia. No immunoreactivity was detected in senile plaques or neurofibrillary tangles in the three cases of AD. Our results suggest that SAF, the causative pathogenic agent, and extracellular deposits of amyloid in the brain are closely related. Immunohistochemical detection of SAF protein could serve as a useful diagnostic adjunct in the postmortem evaluation of difficult cases of dementia. The identification of SAF protein in the brains of two affected members of a family combining the clinical and pathological features of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS) substantiates earlier conclusions of a nosological relationship between the two. Our study provides further evidence of the similarity of SAF protein to prion protein (PrP 27-30).\r"

  ".W": "The rapid appearance of selective axonal calcification following experimentally induced spinal cord impact injury has suggested that there is a sudden influx of intracellular calcium which mediates many of the pathological changes subsequent to the trauma. Granular dissolution of axoplasm and vesicular disruption of myelin are the most characteristic alterations in the affected white matter. These changes, which appear early and progress, are identical to those that can be induced by exposing myelinated axons to increased extracellular calcium or to calcium ionophores. These observations have led us to develop the hypothesis that calcium mediates the destruction of traumatized axons in the spinal cord by stimulating calcium-activated neutral proteinases (CANP), which in turn degrade axonal and myelin proteins. A rapid increase in CANP activity has been demonstrated in our experimental rat trauma model and a CANP has been isolated from rat spinal cord myelin which degrades both neurofilament and myelin proteins. However, the interpretation of the role of calcium has been complicated by the fact that granular axoplasm and vesicular myelin can be induced under conditions other than those favorable for CANP enhancement. The ultimate proof of the calcium hypothesis will depend on analyzing early intracellular ionic fluxes and correlating these with the localization of calcium-mediated enzymes and the evolution of pathological events.\r"

Insurance data permit estimation of the premium cost for the anesthesiologist and hospital, per operating room per year, of $69,429.00. We propose the use of an enhanced monitoring standard requiring a pulse oximeter, capnograph, spirometer, halometer, automatic sphygmomanometer, breathing circuit oxygen analyzer, stethoscope, electrocardiographic monitor, and temperature monitor. We suggest that this premium cost, together with the estimate that 50% of incidents would be avoided, predicts a resultant saving of over $27,000/operating room/year, a savings equal to the entire cost of the enhanced monitoring system in approximately 8 months, or a yearly savings of over five times the annualized expense of the monitoring system. Thus, in addition to the moral imperative to monitor a patient during anesthesia to avoid injury and death, there is an economic incentive to monitor effectively.\r"

  ".W": "Currently, two of the most sensitive clinical approaches commonly used to monitor for venous air embolism, i.e., precordial Doppler audio and capnography, require the attention of the anesthesiologist's eye or ear, which is a distraction from other aspects of care. To assess the feasibility of allowing the computer to relieve the necessity for continuous human monitoring, we developed a computer algorithm for monitoring the precordial Doppler audio. This algorithm extracted (1) the amplitude of certain higher-frequency components of the Doppler audio, (2) a measure of the average value of the envelope of Doppler audio, and (3) the ratio between the average value of the Doppler envelope and the amount of envelope signal variation at heart rate frequency and its multiples. These three features were monitored by an adaptive pattern recognition algorithm that compared each new value for each feature with the previously developed mean and standard deviation for that feature. If the changes in the three features exceeded a detection threshold, an alarm (indicating suspected air embolism) was activated. Implemented as a prototype system, the algorithm was given preliminary testing in 2 dogs and activated alarms at levels of air well below those reported to cause clinically significant hemodynamic changes in dogs. While decreasing the distraction for the anesthesiologist, this early prototype alarm system alerts its user to the need for analysis of the Doppler signals when it senses an air embolus.\r"

Removal or modulation of these \"blocking factors\" can reverse the immunosuppression. Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus has the unusual property of binding to CIC with high avidity. Use of protein A as an immunoadsorbent in extracorporeal immunotherapy affinity columns has resulted in antitumor and antiviral responses in animals. Our group developed a multicenter trial to assess toxicity and antitumor response with this biologic response modifier alone. Overall, 24% (21 of 87 patients) had objective tumor regressions including both partial responses (PR) and less than PR. No complete responses (CR) were observed. Responses were observed in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi's sarcoma (six of 17 PR; two of 17 less than PR; overall, 47%), breast adenocarcinoma (five of 22 PR; three of 22 less than PR; overall response, 36%), colon adenocarcinoma, (one PR, one less than PR; overall response, 11%), and non-oat cell lung carcinoma (two of seven less than PR). The procedure was well tolerated and could be performed on an outpatient basis. No adverse reaction was observed in 735 of 1,113 treatments (66%). The most common adverse effect was an \"influenza-like\" syndrome consisting of fever and chills. Pain was present in 12% of the patients. There were no study-related deaths. Serum IgG and CIC levels did not statistically change due to therapy in responding or nonresponding patients. Complement levels remained within the normal range. Liver and renal tests remained stable throughout the study. In summary, protein A immunoadsorption of plasma is well tolerated in the outpatient clinic, has demonstrated antitumor activity in resistant solid tumors, and functions as a biologic response modifier.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics and outcome of 58 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who experienced relapse after a first remission duration longer than 18 months (late-relapse AML) were analyzed and compared with those of 278 patients with earlier relapses. Late-relapse AML was associated with a lower incidence of antecedent hematologic disorder, leukocytosis, and elevated creatinine and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. A favorable karyotype (inversion of chromosome 16; translocations between chromosomes 8 and 21, or 15 and 17) was more frequent in patients whose first remission was 12 months or longer compared with less than 12 months (30% v 10%; P less than .0001). An unfavorable karyotype (chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities, trisomy 8, other changes) was more frequent in the latter category (16% v 42%; P less than .0001). Thirty-seven of the 58 patients (64%) with late-relapse AML achieved complete remission (CR). The incidence of CR increased significantly with an increased first remission duration from less than 12, 12 to 18, and greater than 18 months (17% v 41% v 64%; P less than .0001), while the incidence of resistant disease was significantly lower (59% v 36% v 19%; P less than .0001). When effective antileukemic regimens were considered, remission rates were also significantly increased by the duration of first remission (24% v 48% v 72%; P less than .001). Compared with patients with earlier relapse, those with late-relapse AML had a longer median survival from salvage therapy (3.5 v 12 months; P less than .01), and longer median second remission durations (3.5 v 11 months; P less than .01). We conclude that late-relapse AML has unique clinical, cytogenetic, and prognostic characteristics, and remains extremely sensitive to chemotherapy with a potential cure fraction. The duration of first remission is an important prognostic parameter in AML relapse and may be useful in the design and analysis of future salvage programs.\r"

Among the 494 adult patients included in the study, the 237 patients belonging to the favorable group (H5F) underwent a staging laparotomy (Sx) in order to select the patients who could be treated with limited radiotherapy (RT) only. Thus, 198 patients (84%) with negative laparotomy were treated with RT alone and randomized to either mantle irradiation (M) or extended field mantle plus para-aortic (M + PA) irradiation. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 99% of the patients. There was no difference in the 6-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate (74% and 72%, respectively) or survival rate (96% and 89%). Therefore, Sx helped to define those patients who could be treated with M alone in contrast to those who required more aggressive therapy. The 39 patients with positive laparotomy were treated as the unfavorable group (H5U) from onset and randomized to either total/subtotal nodal irradiation (TNI/STNI) or a sandwiched mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) X 3, M irradiation, MOPP X 3 protocol (3M). Although the RFS rate was higher in the 3M arm (100% v 53%; P = .002), the 6-year survival was not significantly different between the two arms (overall, 92%). In the 257 patients with initial unfavorable disease, the Sx was avoided. They were randomized to either TNI/STNI or 3M. In complete responders (96%), the 6-year RFS was 91% in the 3M arm and 77% in the TNI/STNI arm (P = .02). The pattern of failure differed in the two arms: the inverted Y and spleen irradiation controlled occult infradiaphragmatic disease better than MOPP; conversely, less patients begun on MOPP recurred in the involved mantle areas. The difference in 6-year actuarial total survival (TS) (89% and 82%; P = .05 in favor of the 3M arm) was not retrieved after exclusion of the unrelated deaths from the analysis. The two arms produced similar TS in patients under 40 years of age. TNI retains interest, especially in young men wishing to preserve fertility. The overall result shows that when treatment is tailored to initial prognostic factors, excellent results can be obtained in all patient subgroups at minimal morbidity and toxic cost.\r"

Subsequently, 91 (81%) were deemed operable. Patients were then randomized to receive surgery or radiotherapy (RT) to determine which of these modalities afforded better local tumor control. All patients also received 2 additional years of CAFVP in a further attempt to eradicate local disease and systemic micrometastases. Forty-one of the randomized patients have relapsed. Approximately half of the initial relapses in each arm were local. The overall duration of disease control was similar following either modality, with a median of 29.2 months for surgery patients and 24.4 months for RT patients. Similarly, there was no major difference in survival related to randomized treatment with an overall median of 39 months (median follow-up 37 months). Pre- or perimenopausal status and inflammatory disease were associated with shorter disease control and survival. Treatment was generally well tolerated and toxicity was acceptable. This study demonstrates that prolonged control of stage III breast carcinoma can be achieved with combined modality therapy in which cytotoxic chemotherapy precedes and follows treatment directly primarily at the breast tumor, using either surgery or RT. Nevertheless, new regimens must be designed if significant advances that may lead to the cure of this disease are to be achieved.\r"

Seventy-three percent of tumors were aneuploid and 27% were diploid. Multivariate analysis using a Cox model showed that cellular DNA content (P less than .001) and FIGO stage (P less than .02) were the only significant independent prognostic variables. The median survival was 13 months for patients with aneuploid tumors and 60 months for patients with diploid tumors (P less than .0001). Further analysis indicated that the good prognosis associated with diploid tumors was limited to patients with stage III disease, all patients with stage IV (spread beyond the peritoneal cavity or liver metastases) disease having a poor prognosis irrespective of ploidy. On pathological review, nine borderline ovarian tumors (of low malignant potential) were identified, and seven of these were diploid. These tumors have an unusually favorable prognosis, despite apparent dissemination within the peritoneal cavity, a paradox which is often difficult to explain using conventional histological criteria. Although the vast majority of tumors in this study (93%) were classified as invasive epithelial ovarian cancers, it is possible that some of the patients with stage III diploid tumors may have had malignancies that were predominantly of low malignant potential, thus accounting in part for the prognostic significance of DNA content. By incorporating flow cytometric DNA analysis with careful histopathological assessment, it may be possible to better identify patients with an inherently good prognosis. This assumes particular importance, as the relatively favorable prognosis of patients with stage III diploid ovarian tumors appears to be independent of the type of treatment.\r"

Six tumors were of extragonadal origin (four anterior mediastinum, one pelvic, one prostate), and one was of gonadal origin with retroperitoneal metastasis. All patients presented with advanced local disease and a relative absence of distant metastasis. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were elevated in six patients (median, 4,400 ng/mL; range, 2,580 to 31,200 ng/mL). Six patients achieved a complete remission (CR): one with chemotherapy alone, one with initial surgery followed by chemotherapy, and four with chemotherapy followed by consolidative surgery. The remaining patient died of progressive disease. Of the six patients who achieved a CR, five are alive with no evidence of disease (+17, +23, +34, +43, +59 months); one patient developed recurrent disease at 6 months after completion of therapy and is currently undergoing salvage chemotherapy. Of the four patients who underwent postchemotherapy surgery, three were operated on for a marker-negative stable mass; in these patients, no viable tumor was found at pathologic review. The remaining patient underwent surgery for a stable mass with a persistent elevation in AFP levels. He was found to have 95% necrosis with 5% viable tumor and remains disease free without further therapy. The observed changes in AFP levels correlated with regression and progression of tumor; a normal AFP was consistent with a CR, and elevation was consistent with residual tumor. These seven patients demonstrate that when adult men with EST are treated aggressively with combination chemotherapy and surgery, high cure rates can be achieved.\r"

Preclinical studies with xenografts of human RMS, growing in the flanks of immune-deprived mice, had indicated superior oncolytic activity by melphalan compared with other agents commonly used to treat this tumor. However, in a conventional phase II trial, melphalan failed to produce partial responses in 12 of 13 heavily pretreated patients with recurrent tumors. Subsequent comparison of the drug's pharmacokinetics in mice and patients indicated that its poor clinical performance was not the result of interspecies differences in drug disposition. Therefore, we elected to retest melphalan in untreated patients, before they were enrolled in a phase III study. Of 13 children who received the drug for 6 weeks, ten had partial responses, confirming the significant antitumor activity seen in the xenograft system. These findings illustrate the inherent limitations of phase II drug trials in previously treated patients and suggest a useful paradigm for the development of antineoplastic drugs.\r"

There was no significant association between nodule size of 3 cm or larger and survival. Patients who underwent resection had a longer survival. For patients without cirrhosis, location of the tumor in the left lobe regardless of whether it is resected appears to be a prognostic factor associated with prolonged survival. Female sex and the absence of cirrhosis were also associated with longer survival.\r"

  ".W": "Teniposide, a semisynthetic epipodophyllotoxin, was found to be highly active against murine leukemias, and the combination of teniposide with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) was curative in murine leukemia models. The antitumor activity in preclinical models prompted introduction of teniposide into the clinic in 1971. Although teniposide as a single agent rarely produced a complete remission in heavily pretreated leukemia patients, teniposide plus ara-C produced complete remissions in some patients with refractory and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Innovative front-line and salvage regimens using teniposide have been developed that incorporate a multi-drug strategy with early intensification, rotation of drug combinations in maintenance, and regional therapy in an effort to improve the cure rate in leukemia. However, as the complexity of these regimens increases, the contribution of an individual component such as teniposide becomes less clear. Although some of these regimens for newly diagnosed and relapsed ALL are now thought to represent the best available therapy, teniposide remains an investigational agent. In this review, we outline and discuss the conflicts arising from the need to answer drug-specific issues, and, at the same time, facilitate the implementation of innovative, curative regimens.\r"

Serial neurological, ophthalmological, neuroendocrinological, and radiological examinations were performed before and after treatment. Dosimetry was determined based on a computerized tomography (CT) estimation of tumor volume, and was calculated to provide a tumoricidal dose (200 to 300 Gy) to the cyst wall. The follow-up period ranged from 14 to 45 months (mean 27 months). After treatment, all nine patients showed improvement of symptoms and radiological evidence of cyst regression. Because of an expanding solid component producing recurrent symptoms, one patient required a craniotomy 14 months after isotope instillation. Three of five patients with impaired visual acuity before surgery had significant improvement in acuity after treatment. Preoperative visual field defects in eight patients improved in four after 32P therapy. Of seven patients with preoperative endocrine abnormalities, one individual showed almost complete normalization and another had improvement in endocrine function. Patients who exhibited residual neuroendocrine function before isotope instillation developed no significant deterioration in endocrine status during the follow-up period. The findings suggest that stereotaxic intracavitary irradiation is a safe and effective treatment which should be considered as the initial surgery for cystic craniopharyngiomas.\r"

To explore the effect of macrophages in brain tumors on the pathogenesis of peritumoral edema, 42 specimens of primary or metastatic brain tumors were studied. Frozen sections were examined by an immunoperoxidase staining technique with anti-Leu-M3 monoclonal antibody. Eight of 14 gliomas demonstrated Leu-M3-positive cell (macrophage) infiltration. The two glioblastomas showed a moderate or marked degree of macrophage infiltration. Twelve of 16 meningiomas demonstrated varying degrees of macrophage infiltration. All six metastatic brain tumors exhibited prominent macrophages in intra- and peritumoral tissues. Four acoustic neurinomas and two hemangioblastomas showed a slight to moderate degree of macrophage infiltration. Excellent correlation was found between the degree of macrophage infiltration seen on immunoperoxidase staining and the peritumoral edema detected on computerized tomography brain scans of patients with supratentorial tumors, especially meningiomas. Macrophages are known to secrete various substances (including arachidonate metabolites) that may interfere with vascular permeability. These data suggest that macrophages infiltrating brain tumors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of peritumoral edema.\r"

No diurnal variation was observed in either glucose or insulin levels during the 24-h sampling period. However, cortisol levels did exhibit a circadian rhythm, with elevated values observed in the morning and low values in the evening. Experiment 2 investigated the response of glucose, insulin, cortisol and selected amino acids to four isoenergetic equine diets. Four 2-yr-old quarter horse geldings were used in a Latin square design. Pelleted isoenergetic diets were composed as follows on a digestible energy basis: 100% alfalfa (diet A), 50% alfalfa and 50% corn (diet AC), 100% corn (diet C) and 90% corn and 10% corn oil (diet CO). A single meal was fed after an overnight fast. Blood samples were taken via a jugular catheter from 0800 to 1700 h. Analysis of variance by repeated measures and mean response area for glucose showed no difference between diets. However, postprandial peak glucose levels were elevated (P less than 0.01) over prefeeding levels in diets AC and C. Analysis of variance by repeated measures and mean response area for insulin showed differences (P less than 0.05) between diets. Cortisol showed no meal-related responses to any of the diets within its expected circadian rhythm.\r"

  ".W": "Factors influencing microbial protein synthesis in the rumen have been reviewed several times in recent years. Original publications in the past 3 yr have reported microbial and feed protein nitrogen contribution postruminally when feeding a variety of dietary proteins. Ammonia is a satisfactory source of nitrogen for growth of the majority of rumen species, but substitution of intact protein for urea (source of ammonia) usually stimulates microbial protein production. Protein sources such as soybean meal appear to possess properties (perhaps rate of degradability) that optimize microbial growth in vivo. Protein sources more undegradable than soybean meal, when fed as the major nitrogen source, sometimes reduce microbial growth. However, nondegradable proteins may compensate for less microbial protein by supplying intact dietary protein postruminally, so the amino acids potentially available may be equal to or greater than those available when readily degradable protein is fed. Soybean meal may reduce microbial growth in diets containing grass silage at protein exceeding 16.8%. Various measurements of microbial and intact dietary protein postruminally show that the contribution of each can be manipulated. Accuracy of quantitative predictions of postruminal contribution depends on several factors that require more research.\r"

  ".U": "88117822\r", 
  ".W": "The supply of minerals needed to meet rumen microbe requirements should match the amount of energy available for fermentation. Therefore, we attempt to assess microbial requirements for phosphorus (P), sulfur (S) and magnesium (Mg) in terms of fermentable organic matter at the rumen level (OMF) or in terms of digestible matter in the total tract (OMD). In vivo, about 5 g of P and 1.8 g of S/kg OMD should be available (a) in the rumen. Pa is provided mostly by salivary secretion, which depends on several dietary factors as well as on the physiological state of the animal; dietary S supply with natural diets depends on dietary S availability, which can be particularly low for some roughages. Dietary Mg concentration should be in the range 1.5-2.5 g/kg OMD. The circumstances in which major minerals may be used to manipulate rumen fermentation are discussed. With a high concentrate diet the addition of a mineral buffer may help to maintain an adequate pH for cellulolysis and enhance the efficiency and quantity of the microbes produced. Some inconsistent results are obtained, possibly because of the sensitivity of rumen microbes to high osmolality. It is concluded that, as the margin between optimal stimulatory concentration and toxic excess is narrow, rumen fermentation should be manipulated cautiously when using minerals.\r"

These models were constructed to define the dynamic processes involved so that constraints on fiber digestion may be elucidated. The fraction of fiber that is resistant to digestion and the rate of digestion and passage of potentially fermentable fiber were identified as constraints on fiber digestion in the rumen. Fermentation lag was shown to have no direct effect on fiber digestibility. Fiber that is resistant to fermentation by rumen microbes represents a significant fraction of forage fiber and accumulates in the rumen relative to potentially fermentable fiber. The digestibility of fiber that is potentially fermentable is a function of the rate at which the fiber is digested and its retention time in the rumen. Selective retention of potentially fermentable fiber in the rumen is necessary for the maximization of fiber digestion.\r"

  ".W": "Rumen microbiologists are beginning to use genetic engineering techniques, and researchers should carefully consider both the potentials and limitations of using this technology to manipulate the rumen microbial ecosystem. Despite encouraging rhetoric, it is difficult to identify specific examples where genetic engineering would enhance ruminal performance. Many practical problems (lactic acidosis, deamination, etc.) might be better served by genetic engineering approaches that delete rather than add genes. The difficulty with this approach is that a highly selective means of preventing wild types from recolonizing the rumen would be needed. The addition of specific genes is confounded by 1) the fact that the rumen microorganisms are already adapted to the rumen, 2) the diversity of species inhabiting the rumen and 3) the complexity of interactions among these species. Aspects such as increased rates of cellulose digestion and changes in amino acid composition of the microflora are particularly sensitive to these biological constraints. Genetic engineering has, however, the potential to alleviate new limitations that humans have imposed on the rumen (detoxification, resistance to low pH, the digestion of novel feed materials, etc). A particular strategy of moving acid-resistant cellulose genes into noncellulytic, but acid-resistant, rumen bacteria is described.\r"

Before therapy, subjects had a significantly greater glucose response during OGTT than published normal control values. There were no significant changes in mean fasting glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations in any of the treatment groups. The integrated glucose concentrations rose significantly over baseline values in the oxandrolone group at 2 and 12 months and in the combination group at 5 days. There were significant increases in the mean integrated insulin concentrations at 2 and 12 months for the group receiving oxandrolone alone and at all three times for the group receiving combination therapy. Thus oxandrolone, alone or in combination with GH, had significant effects on carbohydrate metabolism in subjects with Turner syndrome, whereas GH alone did not.\r"

A semiquantitative scoring system was used to grade tissue changes in the trachea, carina, and both main-stem bronchi. Alterations were produced by all forms of mechanical ventilation. The degree of injury was similar and relatively mild for the PPV- and HFOV-treated animals at both 24 and 96 hours. Eleven of 17 baboons treated with HFFI ventilation (8/11 at 24 hours; 3/6 at 96 hours) had severe airway damage characterized by diffuse submucosal necrosis, extensive hemorrhage, dense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, sloughed epithelium, focal basophilia, and intraluminal debris. HFOV resulted in no greater degree of airway damage than did PPV. The use of HFFI, with the particular strategy we employed, resulted in a far greater degree of damage than either PPV (P less than 0.01) or HFOV.\r"

Intestinal gangrene or perforation developed in four infants in the control group and six in the clindamycin group. Four in each group died of NEC. In the control group, one of 18 survivors developed a late stricture requiring surgical resection, whereas six of 15 survivors in the clindamycin group developed such strictures (P = 0.022). Routine inclusion of clindamycin in medical treatment of NEC does not reduce the frequency of intestinal gangrene or perforation and may be associated with an increase in late stricture formation.\r"

Criteria for admission were (1) observation within 8 days from first symptoms, (2) dialysis treatment required, and (3) no special treatments and no more than 25 ml blood/kg previously received. Children were subdivided according to age (less than or more than 3 years) and then randomly assigned to treatment with plasma or symptomatic therapy. Thirty-two children ranging in age from 4 months to 6 years entered this study; 17 received plasma (P+ group) and 15 only symptomatic therapy (P- group). The mean follow-up period was 16 months in both groups. Surgical renal biopsy was performed 29 to 49 days after onset in 11 P+ and 11 P- children, and 33 histologic findings were semiquantitatively evaluated. No death occurred in either group. No differences were found in blood pressure, proteinuria, or hematuria at the end of the follow-up period; in no case were severe arteriolar lesions found. There were no significant differences for the scores of the individual histologic measurements; on electron microscopy, no vascular changes were observed in seven children of the P+ group, whereas in five of seven of the P- group, thickening of the lamina rara interna and arteriolar damage were present. The ability of plasma to stimulate prostacyclin (PGI2) production, measured as its stable derivative 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, was within the normal range for all patients. In our patients with predominant glomerular involvement who were treated in a very early phase of HUS, infusions of plasma did not significantly influence the short- and medium-term clinical outcome and were not effective in severe HUS when given later in the course of the disease. A longer follow-up is needed to ascertain whether the presence of endothelial damage, demonstrated by electron microscopy in children who were not given plasma, is of clinical relevance.\r"

While some mechanisms of resistance allow cells to survive exposure to a single agent, the phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) confers upon cells the ability to withstand exposure to lethal doses of many structurally unrelated antineoplastic agents. MDR has been strongly linked to the overexpression of a membrane-associated glycoprotein, P-glycoprotein, which appears to play a role in drug efflux. However, several lines of evidence suggest that other mechanisms of resistance are involved in MDR; biochemical similarities observed in a human breast cancer cell line after the acquisition of MDR and in carcinogen-induced rat preneoplastic hepatic nodules indicate that changes in regulation of phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes may also play a role in MDR. An atypical pattern of MDR has been characterized and related to altered topoisomerase activity. Improvement in current cancer chemotherapy may be achieved by interfering with the regulation and expression of mechanisms of MDR.\r"

Their average time on study was 64.1 months. The patients were randomized to receive no further treatment (184 patients), postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, semustine, and vincristine (MOF) (187 patients), or postoperative radiation therapy (184 patients). The chemotherapy group, when compared with the group treated by surgery alone, demonstrated an overall improvement in disease-free survival (P = .006) and in survival (P = .05). Employing the proportional hazards model, a global test was used to determine the presence of treatment interactions. Investigation of stratification variables employed in this study indicated that sex, and to a lesser extent age and Dukes stage, made individual contributions to the disease-free survival and the survival benefit from chemotherapy. When evaluated according to sex, the benefit for chemotherapy at 5 years, both in disease-free survival (29% vs. 47%; P less than .001; relative odds, 2.00) and in survival (37% vs. 60%; P = .001; relative odds, 1.93), was restricted to males. When males were tested for age trend with the use of a logistic regression analysis, chemotherapy was found to be more advantageous in younger patients. When the group receiving post-operative radiation (4,600-4,700 rad in 26-27 fractions; 5,100-5,300 rad maximum at the perineum) was compared to the group treated only by surgery, there was an overall reduction in local-regional recurrence from 25% to 16% (P = .06). No significant benefit in overall disease-free survival (P = .4) or survival (P = .7) from the use of radiation has been demonstrated. The global test for interaction to identify heterogeneity of response to radiation within subsets of patients was not significant. In conclusion, this investigation has demonstrated a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (MOF) for the management of rectal cancer. The observed advantage was restricted to males. Postoperative radiation therapy reduced the incidence of local-regional recurrence, but it failed to affect overall disease-free survival and survival.\r"

At 5 years of follow-up, patients treated with surgery alone were at 1.29 times the risk of developing a treatment failure and at 1.31 times the likelihood of dying as were similar patients treated with combination adjuvant chemotherapy. Comparison of the BCG-treated group with the group treated with surgery alone indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (P = .09). There was, however, a survival advantage in favor of the BCG-treated group (P = .03). At 5 years of follow-up, patients randomized to the surgery-alone arm were at 1.28 times the risk of dying as were similar patients treated with BCG. Further investigation disclosed that this survival advantage in favor of BCG was a result of a diminution in deaths that were non-cancer related. When analyses were conducted on which events not related to cancer recurrence were eliminated, the survival difference between the BCG and control groups became nonsignificant (P = .40); the cumulative odds at 5 years decreased from 1.28 to 1.10. The findings from this study are the first from a randomized prospective clinical trial to demonstrate that a significant disease-free survival and survival benefit can be achieved with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Dukes B and C carcinoma of the colon who have undergone curative resection.\r"

  ".W": "Ras-oncogene activation was investigated in the bladder tumors of F344 male rats given N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) in drinking water. DNA from one of the nine transitional cell carcinomas contained an H-ras oncogene detectable by the NIH/3T3 transfection assay. Analysis of p21 ras proteins suggested that the activating mutation resided within codon 61 of the H-ras gene and that such activating mutations were not present in other tumors. In contrast to mutational activation of ras genes, enhanced expression of p21 was observed in all tumors examined by immunohistochemical techniques with the use of Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections and an anti-ras p21 antibody, RAP-5. Further histochemical analysis of bladder tissues at various stages of the BBN-induced carcinogenic process indicated that the enhanced expression of p21 appeared early; the reactivity with RAP-5 was observed in diffuse hyperplastic epithelia after 5 weeks of exposure to BBN. The frequency of ras oncogenes, activated either by point mutations or overexpression of p21, in BBN-induced rat bladder carcinomas has thus been shown to be similar to that observed in human bladder carcinomas.\r"

We have developed a treated model of hemorrhagic shock in which unrestrained and unanesthetized rats are bled to a mean arterial pressure of 30 torr until 80% of the maximum shed volume must be returned. Rats are maintained preshock and treated post shock with a 20% glucose-electrolyte solution. Survival of these animals is 62% at 24 hours post shock and all animals are dead at 72 hours post shock. Blood cultures obtained during shock become positive at 2 hours into the shock period and are significant compared to controls at 3 to 5 hours of shock (p less than 0.0001). Blood cultures obtained after the period of shock are significantly positive at 24 and 48 hours post shock (p less than 0.05) compared to controls. Intrashock cultures are monomicrobial; the majority of post-shock cultures are polymicrobial. All cultured organisms are normal rat enteric flora. Histologic changes of renal failure are also demonstrated post shock. We suggest that bacterial invasion, possibly from the gut, plays a role in the sepsis seen in patients following severe hemorrhagic shock. Sepsis may precede rather than follow the immune incompetence which accompanies shock.\r"

Since there is decreased resistance to bacterial infection with trauma, it was of interest to study the uptake of bacteria. First-pass pulmonary uptake of 51-chromium-labeled, killed Salmonella typhimurium bacteria was studied in 26 pigs. In 16 controls, four injections at hourly intervals revealed an initial uptake of 84.5% +/- 1.5 (Mean +/- S.E.M.) and a 95% first-pass uptake of 78.6% +/- 2.4, and no significant change with time. In the ten traumatized animals only the values at 5 hours were significantly lower than the controls. It is concluded that repeated injections of killed Salmonella typhimurium bacteria without trauma do not interfere with the ability of the lung to remove these bacteria during their first passage through the lung, but that with trauma to the leg do to a slight degree.\r"

The tumor specimens were fixed with 70 per cent ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method with anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The bromodeoxyuridine labeling index, S phase fraction, was determined by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in the tissue sections. All grade 1 tumors had an S phase fraction of lower than 10 per cent. The average S phase fractions for noninvasive (11 cases) and invasive (7) tumors were 9.8 and 20.0 per cent, respectively. Two distant metastatic bladder tumors showed an average S phase fraction of 25.3 and 30.0 per cent. Thus, transitional cell bladder cancers with an S phase fraction of greater than 10 per cent appears to grow faster and be more invasive more often than those with an S phase fraction of less than 10 per cent. The higher S phase fraction may indicate greater biological malignancy. Our preliminary results suggest that measurement of the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index in bladder tumors may be a new objective and quantitative assay of biological potential of individual tumors.\r"

Distension of the urethra with saline during the ultrasound examination enabled classification of the degree of spongiofibrosis, which was confirmed by full depth biopsy in 5 patients. Sonourethrography cannot adequately image the posterior urethra, even when the transcrotal approach is used. However, because it is a dynamic 3-dimensional study and can be repeated without risk of radiation exposure, sonourethrography is preferable to radiographic retrograde urography to evaluate patients with suspected anterior urethral strictures.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the p21 protein of the ras oncogene family was studied in a case of human prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue and the cell line was derived from the primary tumor. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor cells obtained from the primary tumor indicated that approximately 25 per cent of the cells were positive for this oncogene product. However, by the immunoperoxidase method almost all of the tumor cells at the vertebral metastatic sites in the same patient were positive for the p21 protein. The cell line established from the primary tumor displayed 2 distinct subpopulation growth patterns in vitro: a monolayer, density-inhibited growth and a multicellular aggregate type growth morphology. These 2 subpopulations could be separated by density elutriation centrifugation. The isolated subpopulation cells were noted to express prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at high frequency. High levels of expression of these 2 prostatic markers also were found in the tumor cells at the vertebral metastatic sites. However, when the isolated subpopulations were analyzed for the expression of p21 protein, the multicellular grown cells were almost 90 per cent positive for the p21 antigen, whereas only approximately 5 per cent of the monolayer grown cells were positive for the same protein. Our findings suggest that primary prostatic carcinomas are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations of neoplastic cells while only specific subpopulations have metastatic potential. Quantification of prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen in the primary tumor cells probably will not offer a predictive value for the eventual behavior of the tumors. However, evaluation of oncogene products, such as the p21 protein, may be useful as a clinical predictor for metastatic potential.\r"

Many more women than men are affected, with antibiotic therapy being the usual first treatment approach based on symptomology. Some clinicians believe that chronic antibiotic therapy may play an etiological role in interstitial cystitis; however neither clinical nor experimental data support their opinion. The implied pathogenesis of antibiotic injury is an alteration of the bladder mucosa and its protective mucin coating to allow urine-mediated damage to the bladder wall. The purpose of this study is to evaluate rabbit urinary bladder function and morphology during chronic nitrofurantoin administration. The results demonstrate that up to twelve months of chronic nitrofurantoin administration produce no changes in 1) bacterial adherence to the rabbit bladder mucosa, 2) specific antibacterial adherence activity of the bladder mucin, and 3) ultrastructure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis.\r"

In order to identify the progression of events that result in BCG-mediated antitumor activity, studies were performed to evaluate the mechanism of binding of BCG within the bladder. Histological and quantitative studies in a mouse model revealed that BCG attached to the bladder wall only in areas of urothelial damage. Preliminary in vitro data showed that BCG attached to surfaces coated with extracellular matrix proteins. Further studies were then performed using purified extracellular matrix proteins to identify the proteins responsible for attachment. BCG were observed to attach to surfaces coated only with purified fibronectin (FN) but not to other purified proteins including laminin, collagen or fibrinogen. The attachment of BCG to purified FN in vitro was dose dependent and was inhibited by anti-FN antibodies. Moreover, BCG attachment in vivo to bladders with damaged urothelial surfaces was inhibited more than 95% by anti-FN antibodies, but binding was not affected by anti-laminin antibodies or preimmune serum. A survey of commercially available BCG vaccines (Pasteur, Tice, Glaxo, Connaught) showed that only Glaxo BCG did not attach to FN-coated surfaces. Glaxo BCG also was shown to express inferior antitumor activity suggesting that the absence of FN binding by Glaxo may have been associated with the absence of antitumor activity of the vaccine.\r"

Noncardiac vascular complications occurred in 33% of the study group, and in these patients the overall mortality rate (51%) was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in patients without (29%) such complications. Although aortic rupture was the strongest correlate of mortality (90%), death specifically related to vascular occlusion was common when such occlusion occurred in the carotid, mesenteric, and renal circulation. There was a strong correlation between stroke and carotid occlusion (22/26 cases), yet specific carotid revascularization was only used during the chronic phase of the disease. Similarly, peripheral operation was ineffective in reducing the mortality rate in the setting of mesenteric (87%) and renal (50%) ischemia. Fifteen patients required either fenestration or graft replacement of the abdominal aorta for acute obstruction, rupture, or chronic aneurysm development. Thirty-eight patients (12%) demonstrated some degree of lower extremity ischemia, and one third of these required a direct approach on the abdominal aorta or iliofemoral segments to restore circulation. Selected patients with acute aortic dissection may require peripheral vascular operation in accordance with a treatment strategy that directs initial attention to the immediate life-threatening complications.\r"

A prospective study was undertaken to determine its value with random selection between primary closure and saphenous vein patching. A consecutive series of 129 carotid endarterectomies was evaluated by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. Intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in the first postoperative days for control of the surgical technique and after 1 year to serve as a reference for the duplex scanning. Sixty-two patients were selected to have primary closure and 67 were chosen for the patching technique. Both groups were identical with regard to risk factors (mean age 63 years, 74% were men, 57% had hypertension, 41% had coronary disease, 37% had peripheral arterial disease, and 9% had diabetes mellitus), side of operation (55% left), symptoms (18% were asymptomatic), and postoperative DSA (81% were normal, 17% had residual lesions, and 2% had occlusions). A complete 1-year follow-up was obtained in 105 cases (81%); duplex scanning showed recurrent stenosis of more than 50% in 12 cases (11%). This was significantly higher after primary closure (10 of 48 patients = 21%) compared with patch closure (2 of 57 = 3.5%; p = 0.006) and also in women (6 of 25 = 24%) compared with men (6 of 80 = 7.5%; p = 0.03). Recurrent stenosis was present in 6 of 11 women with primary closure (55%), 4 of 37 men with primary closure (11%), 2 of 43 men with patching (5%), and none of 14 women with patch closure (0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Duplex scanning was used after operation to categorize disease severity. At operation, 10 patients (4%) had angiographic and Doppler flow abnormalities identified in the internal carotid artery. Vessel exploration identified intimal flaps, platelet aggregation, or stricture. Residual flow disturbances at the endarterectomy site correlated with perioperative thrombosis and stroke, angiographic abnormalities, primary closure of the arteriotomy, and a postoperative duplex scan consistent with stenosis. In 175 patients (182 sites) with normal arterial flow after carotid bifurcation endarterectomy, no thrombotic events occurred and the incidence of recurrent stenosis (life-table analysis) was zero at 3 months, 5% at 1 year, and 9% at 2 years. The incidence of occlusion and recurrent stenosis was increased (8% at 3 months, 18% at 1 year, and 21% at 2 years) in 68 arteries with residual flow disturbance identified at operation. Assessment of endarterectomy sites for turbulence identifies anatomic lesions that threaten patency and increase the incidence of residual and recurrent stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Almost 75% of carotid body and cervical paragangliomas are adherent to or surround adjacent arteries and cranial nerves. Their resection can result in neurovascular injury, stroke, and excessive blood loss. To assess trends in neurovascular complications, we reviewed 153 carotid body and cervical paragangliomas that were surgically managed between 1935 and 1985. Results of the past 10 years were compared with two previous time periods: period I (1935 to 1965), when carotid artery reconstruction was uncommon at our institution, and period II (1966 to 1975), when methods of intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring and carotid patch angioplasty were being developed. During the past 10 years (period III), surgical approach to these tumors has included intraoperative monitoring of cerebral blood flow, selective use of shunts, vein patch or graft reconstructions after extensive tumor resections, and mobilization of the parotid gland to facilitate adequate exposure of high tumors. Although tumor resection was attempted in 80% of patients in period I, surgical resection was complete in 98% during periods II and III. Three trends were observed: (1) The perioperative stroke rate has decreased dramatically from 23% in period I to 2.7% in period III (p = 0.007); (2) the perioperative mortality rate has been reduced from 6% in period I to no deaths in the past 10 years, but (3) the rate of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction remains unchanged over 50 years (period I, 46%; period III, 40%). The median tumor size among patients with postoperative complications was significantly larger than those without complications (median size: 17 vs. 7 cm3, p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88119335\r", 
  ".W": "Since ultrasonic energy can be used to interrogate vessels at great depth, it is only natural that it should be applied to deeply placed arteries in the abdomen. Early studies suggested that high-grade stenoses of the renal artery could be detected by this approach as long as the peak systolic velocity in the renal artery was normalized by that measured in the abdominal aorta. A retrospective study comparing the peak velocity in the renal artery to that from the adjacent abdominal aorta (the renal aortic ratio) showed that if this value exceeded 3.5, it is likely to be associated with a greater than 60% diameter-reducing stenosis. To test this hypothesis, we used duplex scanning to prospectively evaluate 58 renal arteries in 29 patients in whom arteriograms were available. There were 39 renal arteries with 0% to 59% stenosis, 14 with 60% to 99% stenosis, and five occlusions by angiography. Renal duplex scanning accurately diagnosed 38 of 39, 11 of 14, and four of five of these, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 94% for the detection of a greater than 60% diameter-reducing stenosis. The overall agreement with angiography was 93%. These data show that renal duplex scanning can be used to diagnose renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension or renal dysfunction, thus providing a rational basis for the selection of patients for angiography.\r"

Studies before rehydration revealed inappropriately low plasma arginine-vasopressin (AVP) levels for plasma osmolality, insufficiently concentrated urine, absolutely or relatively low plasma angiotensin II (A-II) concentrations (compared with plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I concentrations), and low serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme activities. The plasma AVP concentrations were positively correlated with the plasma A-II concentrations (r = .677) but not with plasma osmolality. The plasma AVP level was raised by an intravenous infusion of A-II in one patient. These findings suggest the following sequence of events: impaired A-II production caused impairment of thirst perception, renal-concentrating capacity, and AVP secretion and contributed to development of hypernatremic dehydration in these elderly patients.\r"

Use of Feinberg-Whittington or Diamond's culture medium resulted in a diagnosis of 82 and 78 cases, respectively, and the combination of two cultures identified 88 infected women. In comparison, wet-mount examination detected only 53 (60%) of the cases. Cytologic smears were interpreted as positive for T vaginalis in 49 (56%) of the 88 cases but also resulted in seven false-positive smears, and specimens from 18 women with negative cultures were interpreted as \"suspicious\" for trichomoniasis. Monoclonal antibody staining detected 76 (86%) of the 88 positive specimens, including 27 (77%) of the 35 cases missed by wet-mount examination. In summary, wet-mount and cytologic studies were insensitive, and cytology study was the least specific method for diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

However, because HIV has (in some cases rarely) been isolated from these body fluids, guidelines have been developed to reduce more extensive exposures to such secretions. Laboratory and epidemiologic data strongly indicate that HIV is not transmitted through immune globulin preparations, the hepatitis B vaccine, or contact with insects. Increasing evidence from many studies also indicates that HIV is not transmitted through casual contact. All individuals need to be aware of how HIV is and is not transmitted, to reduce high-risk behaviors and to avoid unnecessary fears and actions.\r"

  ".W": "Severe mitral regurgitation caused by acute myocardial infarction has been a particularly difficult management problem with disappointing clinical results. Over a 75-month period, ending March 31, 1987, 611 patients underwent mitral valve operations at Duke University Medical Center. Within this group, 55 patients had clearly defined ischemic mitral regurgitation, and 37 of these required emergency operations. Thirty-one of the 55 patients had isolated posterior papillary muscle dysfunction, nine had papillary muscle rupture, and 15 had severe ventricular dysfunction and generalized annular dilatation. Thirty-two patients were treated with primary mitral valve replacement, and 23 had mitral valve repair. In 18, repair was accomplished by a transventricular approach, combining the techniques of commissural annuloplasty, papillary muscle shortening or reimplantation, and infarct exclusion. Transventricular mitral valve repair proved to be safe, expeditious, and effective in restoring valve competence. Although the repair and replacement groups were similar with respect to all relevant baseline characteristics, improved operative survival was observed after valve repair, as compared to replacement, both for the overall group (p = 0.03) and for acute papillary muscle dysfunction (p = 0.05). These data suggest that a policy of predominant mitral valve repair, when appropriately applied in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation, offers the potential for improving therapeutic results.\r"

  ".W": "The optimum method for lung preservation in preparation for transplantation remains unresolved. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of two pharmacologic agents for prolonging the preservation time of the ischemic lung. We compared hydralazine, a vasodilator, and verapamil, which is both a vasodilator and a calcium channel blocker, in regard to their effectiveness in promoting functional recovery of the ischemic dog lung in a new experimental model. The model consists of exposing the left lung of each dog to normothermic ischemia after clamping the pulmonary artery, vein, and bronchus. After ischemic periods of 1 to 5 hours, pulmonary circulation was reestablished. The functional integrity of the left lung was then evaluated by ligating the right bronchus, so that the dog was completely dependent on the previously ischemic lung. The left lung of eight dogs was perfused with 200 ml of Collins-Sachs solution alone in group A, with Collins-Sachs solution containing 20 mg of hydralazine in group B (n = 8), and with Collins-Sachs solution containing 5 mg of verapamil in group C (n = 8). The mean ischemic time was 2.3 hours in group A, 3.0 hours in group B, and 3.1 hours in group C. One dog in group A survived after 1 hour of ischemia, two dogs in group B survived after 1 and 3 hours of ischemia, and six dogs in group C survived 2 to 4 hours of ischemia. Oxygen tension in room air after bronchial ligation was 39.9 +/- 10.2 mm Hg in group A, 59.4 +/- 35.3 in group B, and 76.1 +/- 32.9 in group C. Statistical significance existed between groups A and C (p less than 0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance after bronchial ligation was 428.9 +/- 158.8 dynes.sec.cm-5 in group A, 219.9 +/- 51.9 in group B, and 208.3 +/- 84.5 in group C. Thus tissue damage caused by ischemia was significantly less with verapamil than with the vasodilating drug hydralazine.\r"

To determine the effects of verapamil on left ventricular systolic function, we implanted ultrasonic dimension transducers in dogs and, after they had recovered from the operation, studied them while they were awake and unsedated. Intravenous administration of verapamil (0.2 mg/kg) resulted in an elevation of cardiac output above baseline because of reflex-induced tachycardia. Contractility, as measured by the load-independent end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, remained unchanged. When the animals were pretreated with atropine and propranolol, verapamil resulted in a fall in cardiac output and contractility. The intact animal responded to the vasodilatory effect of verapamil by releasing catecholamines to maintain cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. Only when this compensatory mechanism was blocked by a beta-adrenergic blocker do the inherently negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of verapamil become apparent. The clinical ramifications of this finding are of greater importance to the surgeon as more patients receive beta-adrenergic blocking agents up to the time of the immediate preoperative period. We conclude that verapamil should be administered with caution to patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias who have been receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents.\r"

From January 1984 through May 1986, we encountered seven patients with acute hepatic failure and entered these consecutive patients in the study; three had non-A, non-B hepatitis and one each had type B hepatitis, fulminant Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), acute allograft (liver) failure, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Two of these seven patients were unable to undergo PDHF because of a precarious hemodynamic status. Of the five patients treated with PDHF, four had amelioration of hepatic encephalopathy; in two of these patients, a close temporal relationship was noted between the improvement and the procedure. Four patients had appreciable thrombocytopenia related to PDHF and bleeding complications. Our preliminary results support a possible role for PDHF as a temporary artificial liver support system for patients with acute hepatic failure.\r"

For most measurements, the mean predicted values were greater in male than in female subjects. Heart weight correlated better with body weight and body surface area than with body height or age of patients. In contrast, ventricular wall thicknesses and valve circumferences correlated better with age of the patients than with measurements of body size. In both sexes at all ages, the thickness of the left ventricle was greater than that of the right ventricle and was generally less than that of the ventricular septum. The circumference of the tricuspid valve usually exceeded that of the mitral valve, but aortic and pulmonary valve circumferences were similar. On the basis of these data, equations were derived and reference tables were constructed to predict normal values for heart weight, ventricular wall thicknesses, and valve circumferences.\r"

Body weight was a better predictor of normal heart weight than was body surface area or height, and mean heart weights were greater in men than in women at all ages. When heart weights were indexed (divided by body surface area), the mean values per decade increased significantly in women between the 3rd and 10th decades of life (P less than 0.01) but remained relatively constant with time in men. We found no significant differences in ventricular wall thicknesses between men and women. Although indexed mean values for left and right ventricular wall thicknesses remained relatively constant in all decades, ventricular septal thickness increased significantly between the 3rd and 10th decades of life (P less than 0.001). Beyond the seventh decade of life, the mean ratio of septal to left ventricular free wall thicknesses exceeded 1.20, and the upper 95% confidence limit exceeded 1.50--an important consideration in evaluation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in elderly patients. Mean valve circumferences were usually greater in men than in women, but the opposite pertained when values were indexed by body surface area. In both sexes, all indexed mean valve circumferences increased progressively throughout adult life, although this trend was greater for semilunar than for atrioventricular valves. The mean circumference of the aortic valve surpassed that of the pulmonary valve in the 4th decade and approached that of the mitral valve by the 10th decade of life. Thus, in evaluation of annuloaortic ectasia, investigators should take into account the normal age-related changes in aortic valve dimensions.\r"

Specific antibody activity can be identified in organic dust-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma that contributes to disease pathogenesis. The availability of opsonic antimicrobial antibodies is essential for optimal function of phagocytes in uptake and containment of bacteria. With an absolute or functional deficiency of IgG, recurrent and chronic types of sinopulmonary infections occur. These extremes of IgG availability, either high levels (presumably excessive) or deficient, are discussed in this review.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy with pharmacologic agents is an exciting approach to the treatment of myocardial infarction. The results of several clinical studies indicate that perfusion can be restored with intravenous therapy and may be associated with a reduction in infarct size and improved left ventricular function. In a trial involving more than 11,000 patients, thrombolytic therapy reduced acute and long term mortality. Pharmacologic thrombolysis, however, is not without problems. When administered intravenously, the agents currently available, streptokinase and urokinase, are associated with a relatively low recanalization rate as well as a risk of adverse effects, most commonly a systemic lytic state and risk of bleeding complications. Although intracoronary administration is associated with a higher rate of recanalization, the need for cardiac catheterization limits its applicability and results in a delay in the initiation of thrombolytic therapy (which diminishes salvage of myocardium). The trials assessing the existing agents have shown that time is a critical variable in the success of thrombolytic therapy. This had led investigators to focus more attention on intravenous agents that can be administered rapidly. The newer agents now under investigation, acylated streptokinase and single-chain urokinase, may represent improvements of currently available products and may offer potentially increased benefits. A fibrinogen-sparing agent, such as t-PA, in addition to being highly effective, may offer advantages through minimizing the systemic lytic effect. Additional randomized, controlled clinical trials currently are underway to determine the effect on mortality of this \"fibrinolytic\" therapy as part of a total treatment regimen. The current status of our knowledge concerning thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction can be summarized as follows: 1. Transmural (that is, Q wave) myocardial infarction usually is caused by an obstructing coronary thrombus. 2. The thrombus can be lysed with intravenous therapy in the majority of cases, particularly with newer, well-tolerated fibrin-specific agents. 3. There is considerable evidence suggesting that reperfusion reduces the acute morbidity and mortality when therapy is administered successfully within the initial 3 to 4 hours (and possibly up to 6 hours) after onset of symptoms. 4. Data on long term prognosis after thrombolysis are very encouraging, although limited. 5. Conventional agents lead to significant fibrinogen depletion and therefore an increased risk of bleeding; the new fibrin-selected agents cause less fibrinogen degradation and may reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

CoQ subserves an endogenous function as an essential cofactor in several metabolic pathways, particularly oxidative respiration. As an exogenous source in supraphysiologic doses, CoQ may have pharmacologic effects that are beneficial to tissues rendered ischemic and then reperfused. Its mechanism of action appears to be that of a free radical scavenger and/or direct membrane stabilizer. Initial clinical studies performed abroad and in the United States indicate that CoQ may be effective in treating certain patients with ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, toxin-induced cardiotoxicity, and possibly hypertension. The most intriguing property of CoQ is its potential to protect and preserve ischemic myocardium during surgery. Currently, CoQ is still considered an experimental agent and only further studies will determine whether it will be useful therapy for human cardiovascular disease states.\r"

Left ventricular volumes were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with cross-sectional echocardiography and Simpson's rule analysis of standardised apical views. The captopril group showed no significant change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index but left ventricular end-systolic volume index was significantly reduced and stroke volume index and ejection fraction were significantly increased from 1 month on. In contrast, the frusemide and placebo groups showed significant increases in ventricular volumes, with stroke volume index unchanged and ejection fraction slightly reduced. The changes in the captopril group were significantly different from those in the other groups.\r"

The combinations of serum CA-125 measurement with ultrasound and vaginal examination with ultrasound achieved specificities of 99.8% and 99.0%, respectively. 100% specificity was achieved by serum CA-125 measurement with vaginal examination and by the combination of all three tests. The findings indicate that no individual screening test has acceptable specificity for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. However, the combination of CA-125 measurement with ultrasound did achieve acceptable specificity and offers the most hope of a specific and sensitive method for early detection.\r"

All 4 patients had normal GH concentrations as measured with an IM-9 cell radio-receptor assay (RRA). The RRA/RIA ratio of the 4 patients significantly exceeded that of controls.

  ".W": "The reported prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy varies from 5 to 80%. This unsatisfactory state may relate to evaluation of different patient groups, different minimal criteria for the diagnosis of neuropathy, and different degrees of surveillance. To made matters worse, patients with polyneuropathy tend to be equated ignoring differences in severity. To remedy this situation, four recommendations are made: (1) population-based patients should be studied, (2) nerve conduction should be used to set minimal criteria for neuropathy because the test is objective, sensitive, and repeatable, (3) validated tests of symptoms and deficits should also be used because clinical manifestations of neuropathy cannot be accurately inferred from electrophysiologic measurements, and (4) approaches to staging severity of neuropathy should be developed and used in expressing abnormality. To this end minimal criteria for the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy have been proposed, and validated tests to assess neuropathic symptoms and sensory deficits have been developed. In this report we also propose a staging approach utilizing nerve conduction and neurologic history and examination and validated tests of neuropathic symptoms and deficits.\r"

Ultrasound scans were interpreted without knowledge of clinical presentation or results of other tests. Muscular dystrophy produced a brightly speckled pattern of increased echo from the muscle, whereas spinal muscular atrophy showed a moderate increase in muscle echo and associated muscle atrophy. Acute dermatomyositis produced a moderate increase in echo that varied markedly with the direction of the ultrasound beam in relation to the muscle fibres. The ultrasound scan was normal in children with hypotonia of cerebral origin, Prader Willi syndrome, ligamentous laxity, and other \"nonneuromuscular\" causes. In eight patients ultrasound scanning showed a striking degree of selective involvement of individual components of the quadriceps muscle, which provided considerable diagnostic help for selective needle biopsy. Ultrasound scanning in children has the major advantage of being a noninvasive and pleasant out-patient procedure, which can be readily done on multiple sites. It is a valuable screening test in the investigation of children with neuromuscular disorders.\r"

Twenty-one of these patients (average age, 36 years) underwent successful transplantation after 8 hours to 31 days of circulatory support. The other eight patients died because their condition could not be stabilized for transplantation, despite restoration of blood flow. Fourteen patients received biventricular support; 15 received only left ventricular support, with pharmacologic assistance of right heart function. Before transplantation, blood flow from the left prosthetic ventricle averaged 2.8 +/- 0.4 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, and from the right prosthesis 2.4 +/- 0.4 liters, as compared with an average flow of 1.6 +/- 0.5 liters per minute per square meter before implantation. Of the 21 patients who received heart transplants, 20 were discharged from the hospital after a median of 31 days. Nineteen patients were alive at 7 to 39 months, and 11 of the first 12 were alive at one year. We conclude that heterotopic placement of prosthetic ventricles as a bridge to transplantation provides an effective method of temporarily supporting cardiac function in critically ill patients without removing the natural heart. The early survival rate after transplantation is similar to that with elective cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with nafarelin, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, reversibly inhibits ovarian function and induces hypoestrogenemia. To determine the efficacy of such hormonal manipulation in the treatment of endometriosis, we randomly assigned 213 patients with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis to receive, for six months, either nafarelin by nasal spray (400 or 800 micrograms per day) or oral danazol (800 mg per day). Placebo nasal spray and placebo tablets were used to double blind the study. Pretreatment and post-treatment laparoscopies were compared by means of the American Fertility Society's scoring system. More than 80 percent of the patients in each treatment group had a reduction in the extent of disease as assessed by laparoscopy. The mean laparoscopic scores decreased from 21.9 to 12.6 with 800 micrograms of nafarelin, from 20.4 to 11.7 with 400 micrograms of nafarelin, and from 18.4 to 10.5 with danazol (P = 0.0001 within each group; there were no statistically significant differences between the groups). The percentage of women with severely painful symptoms of endometriosis decreased from about 40 percent to 5 to 10 percent, whereas the percentage with no or minimal discomfort rose from 25 to 70 percent. Of the 149 patients who tried to become pregnant, 58 (39 percent) succeeded after the completion of treatment; similar rates of pregnancy applied to the three treatment groups. Danazol use decreased high-density lipoprotein levels and increased low-density lipoprotein levels. These changes were not observed in nafarelin users, but a higher percentage of them reported hot flashes and decreased libido. We conclude that nafarelin is an effective agent for treating endometriosis and has few side effects other than hypoestrogenism.\r"

  ".W": "Attempts to predict the course of the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been hampered by the lack of an objective, practical way to estimate the prevalence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the general population. Testing for the prevalence of HIV infection in women should be a sensitive means to track the epidemic and to study the potential for perinatal transmission. Antibodies in maternal blood are contained in neonatal blood specimens routinely collected on absorbent paper for other purposes, such as screening for phenylketonuria; we therefore tested for HIV antibody in these specimens. Analysis of batches of individually blinded specimens from selected hospitals protected the anonymity of the mothers and babies and was cost efficient. Using the newborn's blood as an indicator of the mother's serologic status, we concluded that 1 of every 476 women (2.1 per 1000) giving birth in Massachusetts was positive for HIV antibody by immunofluorescence assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, both confirmed by immunoblot (Western blot) testing. The prevalence of HIV infection varied according to the type and location of the maternity hospitals; rates of seropositivity were highest in inner-city hospitals (8.0 per 1000), lower in mixed urban and suburban hospitals (2.5 per 1000), and lowest in suburban and rural hospitals (0.9 per 1000). This method is useful for collecting data needed to plan and evaluate prevention strategies and to predict the health care resources that will be needed to care for women and children who contract AIDS. Because other states have newborn screening programs similar to the Massachusetts program, this approach can be used for national surveillance of AIDS in women.\r"

These results indicate that it is possible to obtain stable expression of exogenous chromosomal DNA sequences introduced into mature haematopoietic cells in vivo via stem cell infection, and that human disorders of haemoglobin production may be more feasible candidates for somatic cell gene therapy than previously suspected.\r"

The LFA-1 molecule, a member of a superfamily of adhesion molecules, participates in adhesion which is critical to the function of each of the three major subsets of leukocytes: lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Putative LFA-1 ligands have been identified functionally in different laboratories using three different monoclonal antibodies that inhibit LFA-1-mediated leukocyte adhesion in particular model systems; however, there may be more than one LFA-1 ligand. We have directly compared the three relevant monoclonal antibodies, and show that each binds to the same molecule, intercellular-adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Most important, B, T and myeloid cells adhere specifically to purified ICAM-1-coated surfaces; such adhesion has distinctive requirements for Mg2+ and Ca2+. This constitutes biochemical evidence that ICAM-1 functions as a ligand for LFA-1-dependent adhesion by a variety of leukocytes.\r"

  ".U": "88122576\r", 
  ".W": "There have been many reports that eukaryotic cells contain ring-shaped 19S or 20S particles which are composed of numerous polypeptide subunits ranging in size between 25 and 35 kilodaltons. Because these particles seemed to copurify with inactive mRNA, they were assumed to function in regulating mRNA translation and hence were named 'prosomes' (for 'programmed-o-some'). A number of properties have been reported for these structures, including an association with specific RNA species or with certain heat-shock proteins and involvement in tRNA processing or aminoacyl tRNA synthesis. However, these proposed activities have not been supported by definitive evidence. During studies of the proteolytic systems in mammalian tissues, we noted many similarities between these 19S particles and the high molecular weight protease complexes that are present in most or all eukaryotic cells. This (700 kilodalton) enzyme complex, designated here as LAMP for 'large alkaline multi-functional protease', contains three distinct endoproteolytic sites which function at neutral or alkaline pH and are specific for hydrolysis of proteins, hydrophobic peptides, or basic peptides. This protease also exists in a latent form which can be activated by polylysine, fatty acids, or ATP. In this report, we show that the prosomes and these protease complexes are very similar or identical with respect to their size, polypeptide composition, immunological cross-reactivity, appearance in the electron microscope, radial symmetry of subunits, subcellular localization, and proteolytic activities. Therefore, the 'prosome' probably plays a critical role in intracellular protein breakdown, and we propose that it be renamed 'proteasome'.\r"

  ".W": "The classical neuro-ophthalmologic literature describes the organization of the primate's optic tract as containing a single topographic representation of the complete contralateral visual hemifield. In contrast, cats have separate visual field representations for the optic axons of the functionally distinct retinal ganglion cell classes. As the line of decussation for each ganglion cell class in the cat occupies a different location on the retinal surface, whereas in primates they are all superimposed, such a species difference might be expected. We report that implants of horseradish peroxidase placed in either the deep or superficial extremes of the monkey's optic tract produce retrograde labelling of distinct retinal ganglion cell classes, and produce anterograde labelling confined to distinct laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Hence, the optic tract of the primate cannot contain a single representation of the contralateral visual hemifield; rather, independent visual field representations for the functionally distinct optic axons must exist. Their anatomical segregation may account for the clinical observation of selective impairments of distinct visual abilities following partial interruption of the optic tract in man.\r"

Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase catalyses the cis-trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds in oligopeptides and during the refolding of several proteins. The other enzyme, protein-disulphide isomerase, accelerates the reactivation of reduced proteins, presumably by catalysis of thiol-disulphide exchange reactions. Recent evidence indicates that the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in collagen biosynthesis, is identical with disulphide isomerase. On the basis of this important finding, it was suggested that disulphide isomerase accelerates protein folding, not by 'reshuffling' incorrect disulphide bonds, but in the same way as prolyl isomerase by catalysing proline isomerization which is known to be important for the folding of collagen and other proteins. Here we show that the catalytic activities of these two enzymes are different. Disulphide isomerase accelerates the reformation of native disulphide bonds during protein reoxidation. We find no evidence that this enzyme can catalyse the isomerization of proline peptide bonds, a reaction efficiently accelerated by prolyl isomerase. When both enzymes are present simultaneously during protein folding, they act independently of one another.\r"

A similar condition known as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy occurs in the Kagoshima prefecture of Japan. Recent but controversial reports suggest involvement of virus related to HTLV-I in multiple sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological studies indicate that TSP lesions are like multiple sclerosis in that they are disseminated throughout the nervous system. Complete virus from patients with TSP has proved difficult to isolate using techniques successful in adult T-cell leukaemia cases associated with HTLV-I. Here we report the isolation of an HTLV-I-like virus from T-cell lines derived from the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of TSP patients. The monoclonal antibody OKT3 was used to generate non-transformed T-cell lines that express HTLV-I antigens. Infectious virus was demonstrated by co-cultivation and complete, replicating virions were visualized ultrastructurally.\r"
