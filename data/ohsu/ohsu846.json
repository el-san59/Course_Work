This needle has a short, straight, sharpened point with a reverse cutting edge, followed by a curved distal section. Despite its geometry, it exhibited a similar resistance to bending and breakage as did a curved needle with a single radius of curvature manufactured from the same alloy. The design of this new needle enabled the physician to pass it through the dermis with a greater accuracy to a controlled depth and length of bite than curved cutting edge needle with a single radius of curvature.\r"

Low voltage current, especially alternating current, can lead to sustained muscular contraction and subsequent fracture of adjacent bones or dislocation of affected joints. We present the case of a 57-year-old male who suffered electrical injury from hand to hand. He did suffer bilateral humeral head fractures but did not suffer cardiac or long-term neurologic injury. Failure to recognize that sustained muscular contraction can lead to fracture or dislocation can result in delayed diagnosis and inappropriate therapy. However, with prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy, morbidity can be minimized.\r"

  ".W": "Infectious mononucleosis is an acute viral illness associated with a high incidence of splenomegaly, although the incidence of splenic rupture is low. When rupture occurs, the mortality has been significant, presumably, because a history of trauma is not present. The spleen may be vulnerable to injury due to the histopathologic changes that occur as a result of this illness. Essentially all patients with spontaneous rupture related to infectious mononucleosis have epigastric or upper abdominal pain. The diagnosis of splenic rupture may be confirmed in a variety of ways. In those patients who are hemodynamically stable, CT scan, ultrasound, or radionuclide scan may aid in establishing the diagnosis. Selective splenic angiography is very accurate but has been largely abandoned because of the invasive nature of the study. Peritoneal lavage is efficacious in establishing the diagnosis in hemodynamically unstable patients. The treatment of choice, at this time, is splenectomy. Current interest in splenic salvage has resulted in reports of nonoperative therapy in stable patients and splenorrhaphy in one instance. Due to the extent of the histologic changes in the spleen, caution is urged in electing the conservative approach to this clinical situation.\r"

Early misdiagnosis and inadequate management of panic attacks can have devastating long-term clinical and financial consequences. The purpose of this paper is to provide information designed to increase the comfort and efficacy of emergency physicians and allied professionals in dealing with panic attacks. The authors offer guidelines regarding differential diagnosis, present strategies for management of acute symptoms of panic and anxiety, and make recommendations for brief postpanic clinical intervention.\r"

  ".U": "90110993\r", 
  ".W": "mAb 1C11 was raised against the cells of retrovirus-negative, radiation-induced thymomas of C57BL/Ka mice. MAb 1C11 binds to radiation- and RadLV-induced C57BL/Ka lymphomas, to lymphomas of other mouse strains and to B-lineage tumors. The 1C11 Ag is expressed on a subpopulation of normal thymocytes that is enriched in immature cells. After fractionated x-irradiation, this percentage increases gradually during the preleukemic period, hence mAb 1C11 appears to identify a transformation-related cell surface molecule. This conclusion is supported by experiments demonstrating that flow microfluorimetry-sorted, 1C11-expressing preleukemic thymocytes progress rapidly to full neoplasia following intrathymic injection, whereas nonexpressing cells do not. Most of day-14 fetal thymocytes are as strongly positive as thymic lymphomas for the 1C11 Ag whereas Ag-activated T cell lines express moderate levels. Multiparameter flow microfluorimetry analysis shows that 1C11 is expressed predominantly on CD3-/lo thymic blast cells of three phenotypically defined subsets: CD4-8-, CD4-8+, and CD4+8+, all of which contain thymic progenitors. By immunohistochemical staining, the Ag is also found in association with epithelial cells on a variety of normal, nonlymphoid tissue, but is not detectable on heart tissue. The 1C11 antibody immunoprecipitates a disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein of 85/37 kDa and the antigenic determinant is located on the H chain of the molecule. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, the molecule exists as a 130-kDa protein. Enzymatic digestion of the heterodimer indicates that the H chain, but not the L chain, has at least three N-linked glycosylation sites. We propose that this novel cell surface glycoprotein may be associated with processes of differentiation and lymphomagenesis.\r"

We have explored the virus-specific cellular immune response in SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. Con A-activated, IL-2 expanded PBL of some SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys lyse autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that carries the SIVmac gag gene. This lysis is mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes and is MHC class I restricted. Moreover, these effector lymphocytes do not express the NK cell-associated molecules NKH1 or CD16. These cells are, therefore, CTL. In a limited prospective study of SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys, the presence of the SIVmac gag-specific CTL activity in PBL correlated with both a reduced efficiency in isolating SIVmac from PBL of these monkeys and their extended survival. This method for assessing SIVmac gag-specific cellular immunity in rhesus monkeys will be important not only in investigating the immunopathogenesis of SIVmac-induced disease, but also in evaluating the capacity of candidate AIDS vaccines to elicit a cell-mediated immune response in this animal model.\r"

Cultures were performed in serum-free conditions in the presence of polymyxin B and of the PG synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. Induction of intracellular IL-1 activity was associated with that of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta Ag. Biologically active released IL-1 was IL-1 beta. Monomeric C3b induced cell-associated IL-1 but not the release of IL-1 from monocytes. IL-1 production was also induced by stimulation of CR1 on adherent monocytes with anti-C3b receptor (CR1) antibody. The ability of multivalent C3b to induce IL-1 production could be dissociated from that of possibly contaminating LPS by several criteria including: the lack of detectable LPS in purified C3b; functional inhibition of LPS in cultures with polymyxin B; the lack of induction of extracellular IL-1 by C3b monomer; a correlation between the expression of CR1 on monocytes and the monocytic response to C3b; a dissociation between the expression of CR1, and the expression of LPS binding sites and the IL-1 response of monocytes to endotoxin. Induction of IL-1 represents a novel pathway by which C3b-CR1 interactions may modulate the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "A neutrophil-activating peptide (NAP)/IL-8 produced by LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes was biochemically purified and functionally characterized by different investigators. Work conducted in our laboratory showed that NAP/IL-8 as well as variants of this peptide are produced by a variety of cells (e.g., monocytes, T lymphocytes, endothelial cells) and that lesional psoriatic scales contain large amounts of biologically active NAP/IL-8. We now investigated human dermal fibroblasts for production of NAP/IL-8. The peptide was detected by immunocytochemistry by using the mAb 46E5. NAP/IL-8 mRNA was visualized by high resolutive fluorescent in situ hybridization with biotinylated antisense/sense RNA probes. Among the various stimuli used [human (h)rIL-1 alpha, hrTNF-alpha, hrIL-3, hr-granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, LPS, FMLP, and platelet-activating factor (PAF)] only hrIL-1 alpha (100 U/ml) and hrTNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) induced the transcription and translation of NAP/IL-8. In contrast to monocytes, LPS was without effect in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Both NAP/IL-8 and NAP/IL-8 mRNA were found in the cytoplasm adjacent to the nucleus, but interestingly NAP/IL-8 mRNA was not restricted to the cytoplasm. In positive cells only two small bright spots were randomly distributed in the nucleus. Most likely these spots represent transcription sites where NAP/IL-8 mRNA is accumulated during gene expression. Our observations show that stimulation of dermal fibroblasts with the cytokines hrIL-1 alpha and hrTNF-alpha results in expression of IL-8.\r"

C4BP interacts with C C4b on a domain located in a 48-kDa chymotryptic fragment. We now demonstrate that C4BP contains heparin-binding fragments, which are located within the C4b binding domain. We have used an assay using heparin coupled to Sepharose CL-6B to show that 125I-C4BP binds to heparin in a time-dependent, saturable, and reversible manner. Binding could be inhibited by purified 48-kDa fragments and direct binding on the 48-kDa fragments to heparin-Sepharose was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. mAb against native C4BP and the isolated 160-kDa central core fragment were evaluated for their ability to block the binding of 125I-C4BP to heparin and C4b. The relative efficacy of mAb against intact C4BP in blocking C4BP binding to heparin-Sepharose was similar to that for blocking 125I-C4BP binding to C4b. In addition, heparin blocked the binding of 125I-C4BP to C4b and vice versa. It is therefore likely that the heparin-binding fragments are localized on or close to the C4b-binding site of C4BP.\r"

Inasmuch as Clq inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation, we compared the effects of ClqR occupancy by purified Clq, monoclonal (IIl/B5) and polyclonal anti-ClqR antibodies on collagen-induced platelet adhesion, release, and aggregation. Washed platelets in buffered Tyrode's solution containing 2 mM magnesium were preincubated (30 min, 22 degrees C) with antibodies, Clq, or appropriate control buffers and antiserum. Platelet aggregation and release measurements were made using 14C-serotonin-labeled platelets stimulated with type I collagen. Adhesion assays were performed in the presence of magnesium under static conditions at 22 degrees C with 51Cr-labeled platelets and collagen-coated microtiter wells. Concentrations of IIl/B5, polyclonal anti-Clq R antiserum, or Clq causing 82 to 92% (n = 7) inhibition of collagen-induced release and 67 to 98% inhibition of aggregation, failed to inhibit magnesium-dependent platelet adhesion to collagen. Inasmuch as divalent cation-independent platelet-collagen interactions have also been described, further studies were performed to compare the divalent cation requirement of ClqR occupancy by Clq and inhibition of platelet-collagen interactions. Whereas, Clq binding to platelets was divalent cation independent, neither Clq nor anti-ClqR antibodies prevented platelet adhesion to collagen in the presence of EDTA. These data suggest that under defined in vitro conditions, ClqR modulate collagen-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, but not platelet adhesion.\r"

We have recently demonstrated directly that toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) binds to MHC class II molecules with high affinity, and similar results have been reported for SEA and SEB. The ability of T cells to respond to individual SE is associated with the expression of particular TCR-V beta gene elements. In the present study we have examined the effect of polymorphism on the ability of MHC class II molecules to bind SEB and TSST-1. We have used a panel of L cell transfectants that express different allelic forms of each of the three human class II isotypes. Radioligand binding assays detected binding of SEB and TSST-1 to most, but not all of the MHC class II molecules examined. Toxin-driven MHC class II-dependent T cell proliferation occurred with all transfectants examined even in the absence of detectable toxin binding. These results indicate that SE can bind to human MHC class II molecules of diverse phenotypes.\r"

  ".U": "90111029\r", 
  ".W": "To aid in the identification of key residues responsible for the control of class II MHC beta-alpha dimer assembly and expression, a series of cotransfections of human plus mouse beta- and alpha-genes was performed. The resulting expression data were correlated with the sequences of the relevant proteins to identify residues that played critical roles in these processes. For the I-E/DR homologues good expression was seen for both E beta DR alpha and DR beta E alpha combinations involving several allelically variable beta-chains of each species. These results are consistent with the sequence conservation seen for I-E and DR gene products, and indicate that the species-specific differences that do exist play little role in controlling dimer formation or transport. For A beta chains, a more complex picture was seen. A beta d, but not A beta k or A beta b, was found to coexpress with human alpha-chains. Not only did A beta d show expression with the homologous DQ alpha-chain, but it also was expressed with DR alpha and DP alpha. These data indicate that species-specific residues do not control dimer expression under these conditions and confirm that allelically polymorphic residues have a crucial role in this process. Mapping studies using recombinant A beta genes established the importance of the residues in the amino-terminal half of the beta 1 domain in the differences observed among the A beta alleles. Sequence comparison of DR beta, DP beta, DQ beta, E beta, and A beta chains in this region revealed a single residue (position 12) conserved in most chains and differing in a nonconservative fashion between A beta d vs A beta b or k. A beta d has the conserved lysine at this position, whereas A beta b has methionine and A beta k has glutamine. To test whether this residue actually was important physiologically, a lysine codon was created in a recombinant A beta gene possessing the amino-terminal sequence of the kappa haplotype, and the ability of this mutant chain to be expressed with various mouse A alpha-chains was examined. This mutant chain was shown to gain the ability to be efficiently expressed with A alpha d without losing its ability to be expressed with A alpha k. These data reemphasize the special role played by allelically polymorphic residues in Ia expression and identify one such polymorphic site as position 12.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although one of the transgenic lines that expresses only the beta-chain occasionally displays slightly elevated glucose levels, this hyperglycemia is not enhanced when alpha and beta are coexpressed, allowing for cell surface I-Ad expression. None of the mice examined has demonstrated any autoimmune reaction to the I-Ad+ islet cells. Despite this apparent lack of recognition of the I-Ad+ islet cells, these animals demonstrate no reduction in the in vitro MLR generated to the same MHC molecule.

  ".W": "The CD44 inhibitor Lutheran [In(Lu)]-related p80 molecule has recently been shown to be identical to the Hermes-1 lymphocyte homing receptor and to the human Pgp-1 molecule. We have determined the effect of addition of CD44 antibodies to in vitro activation assays of PBMC. CD44 antibodies did not induce PBMC proliferation alone, but markedly enhanced PBMC proliferation induced by a mitogenic CD2 antibody pair or by CD3 antibody. CD44 antibody addition had no effect upon PBMC activation induced by PHA or tetanus toxoid. CD44 antibody enhancement of CD2 antibody-induced T cell activation was specific for mature T cells as thymocytes could not be activated in the presence of combinations of CD2 and CD44 antibodies. CD44 antibody enhancement of CD2-mediated T cell triggering occurred if CD44 antibody was placed either on monocytes or on T cells. In experiments with purified monocyte and T cell suspensions, CD44 antibodies A3D8 and A1G3 augmented CD2-mediated T cell activation by three mechanisms. First, CD44 antibody binding to monocytes induced monocyte IL-1 release, second, CD44 antibodies enhanced the adhesion of T cells and monocytes in CD2 antibody-stimulated cultures, and third, CD44 antibodies augmented T cell IL-2 production in response to CD2 antibodies. Thus, ligand binding to CD44 molecules on T cells and monocytes may regulate numerous events on both cell types that are important for T cell activation. Given that recent data suggest that the CD44 molecule may bind to specific ligands on endothelial cells (vascular addressin) and within the extracellular matrix (collagen, fibronectin), these data raise the possibility that binding of T cells to endothelial cells or extracellular matrix proteins may induce or up-regulate T cell activation in inflammatory sites.\r"

  ".W": "A plasmid which has an envelope gene from the human T lymphotropic virus IIIB isolate of HIV under the transcriptional control of the human metallothionein IIA promoter was constructed and transfected into human CD4+ and CD4- cell lines. When the expression of the env gene was induced with metal ions in cloned cell lines from such transfected cells, the viral envelope protein precursor, gp160, was produced in both the CD4+ and CD4- cell clones in the same amounts. An extensive cytopathic effect developed resulting in cell killing; however, this occurred only in CD4+ and not in CD4- cell clones. The formation of syncytium was not found in those cells showing cytopathic effect. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed the envelope proteins localized in the periphery, forming a mass in the CD4+ cells but not in the CD4- cells after induction. Moreover, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses demonstrated the formation of a complex between gp160 and CD4 molecules in the cytoplasm of those cells from whose surface CD4 Ag had already disappeared. Therefore, it is proposed that the formation of such a complex is directly related to the cell killing of CD4+ cells by envelope proteins in our cell clones as well as in infections with HIV.\r"

It is profoundly inhibitory to the proliferation of quiescent B cells activated in model systems using both thymus-independent and thymus-dependent stimuli and arrests cells predominantly at the G1 cell-cycle stage. It also blocks the proliferation of B cell blasts, with a similar accumulation at stage G1. In parallel with this antiproliferative effect, TGF beta 1 inhibits induction of the expression of a series of \"activation Ag\" including transferrin receptor, RL388, and Ly-6, in mitogen-stimulated B cells. It also inhibits the induction of Ly-6 expression by IL-4, a nonmitogenic stimulus. In contrast to these negative influences, TGF beta 1 induces modestly increased expression of MHC class II Ag in quiescent B cells, and more marked increases in both B cell blasts and mitogen-stimulated cells. We speculate that in the appropriate context TGF beta 1 may be a cytokine that promotes productive B cell-Th cell interaction.\r"

  ".W": "The active sequence in bradykinin (BK) responsible for PGE-aided inhibition of CSF-1-stimulated clonal proliferation of murine mononuclear phagocyte progenitors was determined. In total marrow cultures, BK and (D-Phe7)-BK, a specific BK antagonist, inhibited colony formation by CSF-1 responsive precursors that require two signals, CSF and LPS, for clonal proliferation. (Lys1)-BK, an inactive BK analogue with Lys substituted for the amino-terminal Arg, was inactive. Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly, the amino-terminal tetrapeptide fragment of BK, was fully capable, on a molar basis, of replacing either BK or (D-Phe7)-BK as an inhibitor. Bk, (D-Phe7)-BK, and Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly were not inhibitory for colony formation in cultures containing indomethacin or in cultures depleted of adherent marrow cells. However, in these cultures addition of 10(-9) M PGE2 fully restored inhibition of two-signal-dependent colony formation. PGE2-dependent inhibition by the three peptides was equivalent on a molar basis indicating that Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly contains the sequence responsible for this inhibitory effect of BK and is sufficient to exert PGE-dependent inhibition of two-signal-dependent colony formation. The two-signal-dependent progenitors appear to be in transition to CSF competence suggesting that BK and PGE produced in an hematopoietic environment may act together to limit the production of new macrophages by inhibiting progenitors in transition to CSF competence.\r"

  ".U": "90111091\r", 
  ".W": "Yeast cell wall mannan polysaccharide has been proposed to contribute to immune dysfunction associated with chronic infections involving Candida albicans. This influence of mannan has been suggested based partially upon studies of the in vitro immunoinhibitory effects of mannans prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or C. albicans by precipitation with Fehling's reagent, which provides a structurally modified product contaminated with copper. We have therefore evaluated the immunoinhibitory influence of a more native C. albicans mannan prepared by complexation with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). CTAB mannan was a potent stimulator of lymphoproliferation when added to human PMBC from donors responsive to Candida; it has no inhibitory influence on lympho-proliferation induced by Candida or other Ag. In contrast, members of a family of mannose oligosaccharides (disaccharide through hexasaccharide) derived from the CTAB mannan by weak alkaline degradation did not stimulate lymphoproliferation, but were potent inhibitors of lymphoproliferation stimulated by Candida and other Ag. Fifty percent inhibitory doses were 260 to 34 microM, respectively. Compositional analyses of these immunoinhibitory oligomers showed them to be composed of mannose and free of contaminating protein. We propose that mannan-derived oligosaccharides produced by catabolism of mannan in vivo are immunoinhibitory and contribute to the deficit in cell-mediated immune function associated with chronic candidiasis.\r"

  ".W": "CD2 (T11, the T cell erythrocyte receptor or the SRBC receptor), a nonpolymorphic 47- to 55-kDa glycoprotein, appears to play a role in T lymphocyte adhesion, signal transduction, and differentiation. Pairs of anti-CD2 mAb induce T cell proliferation, suggesting that CD2 may be an Ag-independent pathway of T cell activation. We have expressed the human CD2 and a number of cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants of CD2 in an Ag-reactive murine hybridoma. We have previously shown that a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant, CD2 delta B, in which the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids have been deleted, is no longer capable of signaling through CD2. Here we have expressed a second cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant, CD2 delta S, in which the terminal 41 amino acids have been removed, including the region with greatest conservation between the mouse, rat, and human species. CD2 delta S+ hybridomas were able to respond to Ag and to LFA-3 plus an anti-CD2 mAb. Although the CD2 delta S+ hybridomas responded comparably to the wild-type CD2+ hybridomas to certain pairs of anti-CD2 mAb (e.g., MT110 + 9-1 mAb), these CD2 delta S+ hybridomas were markedly deficient in their ability to respond to other pairs of stimulatory anti-CD2 mAb (e.g., 9.6 + 9-1 mAb). These data suggest that the cytoplasmic domain may have several functional regions, as partial deletions of the cytoplasmic domain appear to result in partial defects in signal transduction.\r"

Six antibodies were identified that inhibited this reaction and that bound a cell-surface glycoprotein (Lgp55), with core polypeptide Mr 30,000 and a glycosylated Mr of approximately 55,000 depending upon the cell source. The properties of Lgp55 were consistent with it being the mouse homologue of a recently identified human ligand (intercellular adhesion molecule-2) for lymphocyte functional Ag-1 because the proteins are of comparable Mr, and antibody to Lgp55, like anti-lymphocyte functional antigen-1, blocks T cell recognition of Ag presented by B cells, but not of Ag presented by mouse fibroblasts.\r"

The antibodies also interfere with cellfree HIV-1 infection of U-937 clone 16 cells. Virus-induced aggregation of these cells and the subsequent syncytia formation leading to massive cell death are efficiently blocked, and the number of infected cells remains at a very low level, 2 to 5%, for the entire culture period. However, anti-CD18 mAb do not inhibit binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cell surface receptor CD4. The results indicate participation of CD18, or of the protein complex CD11a-c/CD18, in addition to CD4, in the infection and cytopathic effect of HIV-1. They also suggest that intercellular adhesion contributes to virus transmission from cell to cell and may be an important mechanism for virus spreading.\r"

Suboptimal doses of haptenized SC were treated in vitro with purified or recombinant derived cytokines and tested for their ability to enhance DTH in vivo. With the use of this protocol, it was shown that both human and mouse rIL-6, as well as mouse rTNF-alpha, potentiated DTH in a dose-dependent manner. In accordance with these data, IL-6/TNF-alpha-containing supernatant from long term nonlymphoid cell lines also possessed the ability to augment DTH. By using the same protocol, we have also identified T cell hybridomas that produce DTH-augmenting activity constitutively. The hybridoma-derived factor, termed the T cell enhancing factor (TCEF), was functionally distinguishable from the defined cytokines IL-1 through IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF by bioassay. Furthermore, RNA derived from the hybridoma failed to hybridize with cDNA probes specific for IL-1 to IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF. Further characterization of the serum-free conditioned media derived from the hybridoma indicated that the TCEF was a soluble acid labile glycoprotein (Mr greater than 30,000). Finally, we investigated the cellular requirements for DTH augmentation by IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TCEF; all are dependent upon the presence of T cells in the immunizing inoculum. We propose that these cytokines play a critical role in the development of DTH responses in vivo.\r"

Cryostat sections of confrontation cultures were immunohistochemically stained with an antiserum directed against the stromal component for automated recognition of the stroma tissue. The slides were automatically processed by a grey level based computerized image analysis system. On Spearman's rank correlation test, 25 out of 39 parameters correlated with the reference value of invasion, which was derived from the subjective evaluation of five independent observers. Two parameters combining the stroma margin and the total amount of stroma tissue completely reproduced the judgement of the morphologists in our test set. The quantitative evaluation of tumor invasion in vitro by automated image analysis may be helpful in pharmacologic and pathogenetic studies of tumor growth.\r"

An antiserum against a small heparan sulfate proteoglycan uniformly stained the dermal-epidermal junction of embryonic rats throughout the period of hair follicle formation. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies recognizing a basement membrane-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan only weakly stained 16-d embryo dermal-epidermal junction, but strong staining was associated with hair follicle buds as they developed. Through the hair growth cycle, it was found that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan persisted around the follicles, while the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan decreased in amount through catagen until it was undetectable at the base and dermal papilla of the telogen follicle. As anagen commenced, expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan was again demonstrated. It therefore appears that a basement membrane-specific proteoglycan shows variation in its distribution in rat skin, expression correlating with morphogenetic activity in hair follicles. It is possible that this newly described basement membrane component is involved in the complex processes of dermal-epidermal interaction that lead to skin appendage formation and growth.\r"

Six of 7 patients given immune DLE gained weight and had a decrease in bowel movement frequency, with eradication of oocysts from stool in 5 patients. Six of 7 patients given nonimmune DLE showed no decrease in bowel movement and 4, no clearing of oocytes from stool; 5 continued to lose weight. Subsequently, 5 of these 7 were treated with immune DLE; 4 had a decrease in bowel movement frequency and significant weight gain, with eradication of oocytes from stool in 2 patients. Immune DLE produces sustained symptomatic improvement in patients with AIDS and active cryptosporidiosis, but lack of an appropriate cryptosporidial antigen allows only postulation that an augmentation of cellular immunity to Cryptosporidium parvum induced by immune DLE resulted in the microbiologic and clinical improvement observed.\r"

  ".W": "Serum samples from 10 infants surviving type III, group B streptococcal (GBS) meningitis were collected acutely and longitudinally for 6 months to determine patterns of antibody response to the capsular polysaccharide and their in vitro functional correlates. Five infants who failed to develop specific antibody at a mean of 3.8 weeks after diagnosis had an increase of greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml after another 4-8 weeks. This IgM-predominant type-specific antibody declined to baseline 2-4 months later. Opsonophagocytosis of type III GBS increased from 0 to 88% in parallel with peak antibody response. Three infants developed increased antibody and opsonophagocytosis at 15-31 weeks after diagnosis, while two had no detectable response. Despite increasing complement levels, opsonophagocytosis of type III GBS was poor with low specific antibody levels These results suggest that survivors of GBS meningitis transiently develop specific antibody and associated efficient opsonophagocytosis, but functional competence does not persist despite maturation to adult levels of complement proteins.\r"

To account for this and other features of the condition, it has been suggested elsewhere that otosclerosis is subject to autosomal dominant transmission with intrauterine selection against male heterozygotes. To test this hypothesis, a search was made for published data on the sexes of sibs of otosclerotics. These sibs do not have an unusual sex ratio, thus casting doubt on the hypothesis. Accordingly it is suggested here that both the condition and the sex ratios are causally related to levels of steroid hormones.\r"

It is an uncommon condition that requires prompt diagnosis and intensive medical therapy if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided. Since the condition was first described in 1979 approximately one hundred cases have been reported. In this paper we present four children with bacterial tracheitis to add to the current literature. Interestingly, one child was admitted on two separate occasions with the disease, an event not previously recorded. All patients underwent endoscopy which revealed findings typical of bacterial tracheitis in each case. None required tracheostomy though three required nasotracheal intubation. Post-endoscopy all were managed in the Intensive Care Unit. There were no fatalities or significant morbidity. The average duration of hospitalization was seven days.\r"

Because blood flow is known to increase in the lower extremities during spinal analgesia, we chose patients receiving spinal analgesia as the experimental model. Although they are indirect indicators, we used laser Doppler readings and skin temperature to reflect peripheral blood flow. These measurements were made from each patient's foot and hand before and after spinal analgesia and were compared with the deflection on the pulse oximeter bar graph. After subarachnoid injection of bupivacaine, laser Doppler readings from the foot increased to 620 +/- 120% (P less than 0.05) of the control reading. The pulse oximeter signal amplitude increased from 5.2 +/- 0.4 to 9.4 +/- 0.3 bars (P less than 0.05) and mean skin temperature increased from 24.6 +/- 0.5 to 31.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C (P less than 0.05). No changes were noted in readings obtained from the hand. A Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter may be used to evaluate the effect of sympathetic nerve block as indicated by an increase in peripheral blood flow.\r"

  ".U": "90111766\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a two-compartment model to simulate neuromuscular function and heart rate following the administration of four nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (atracurium, vecuronium, pancuronium, and d-tubocurarine), three neuromuscular block reversal agents (edrophonium, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine), and two anticholinergic agents (atropine and glycopyrrolate). Twitch depression, train-of-four ratio, and heart rate were modeled during fentanyl, halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane anesthesia, optionally supplemented with nitrous oxide. Simulation results, compared with published values for each drug, fell within the clinical accuracy range (onset time 6.1 +/- 3.9% [mean +/- SEM]; duration, 1.7 +/- 3.5%, 50% effective dose, 0.5 +/- 5.7%; and 95% effective dose, 2.1 +/- 1.1%). The simulation graphically demonstrates the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and interactions between neuromuscular blocking agents, reversal agents, and anticholinergic agents. During a simulation, the need for frequent monitoring and repeated delivery of a neuromuscular blocking agent to keep neuromuscular blockade stable becomes apparent, especially with the intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agents. When inhalational agents are given concomitantly, the task becomes even more difficult, since potentiation changes with anesthetic uptake. Recurarization, tachycardia, or bradycardia may be seen with the simulation if an improper drug regimen is followed. Concurrent simulation of two identical patients allows comparison of different modes of administration, choice of anesthetic agents, and drug doses.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the prognostic significance of erbB-2 overexpression, immunohistochemical staining for the erbB-2 protein was performed on sections from paraffin blocks of 292 primary invasive breast cancers obtained from women enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol B-06. Positive reaction indicative of erbB-2 overexpression was observed on tumor cells in 62 (21%) samples. Women whose cancers were judged to have erbB-2 overexpression had a significantly worse overall survival (P = .0012) with twice the mortality rate of women without detectable erbB-2 expression. No statistically significant effect was evident for disease-free survival (P = .22). In multivariate analysis, detection of erbB-2 overexpression was the second most predictive independent variable for survival after nodal status. Overexpression of erbB-2 was more common among tumors of poor nuclear grade (29%) than those of good nuclear grade (12%). The association of erbB-2 overexpression with decreased survival was evident only among women with tumors of good nuclear grade. In this subgroup, erbB-2 overexpression was associated with an approximately fivefold increase in mortality rate (P = .00001). The combined predictive value of erbB-2 overexpression and nuclear grade was evident regardless of their lymph node status. These results provide evidence that detection of erbB-2 overexpression may be an independent prognostic variable for patient survival. Moreover, when combined with evaluation of nuclear grade, it may be possible to use immunostaining for erbB-2 protein to identify patients at increased risk from within a relatively low-risk group.\r"

One complete remission and four partial remissions were achieved, yielding an overall objective response rate of 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4% to 34%). The median duration of remission was 8 months (range, 5 to 17). Nonhematological toxicity was mild (only 12% with World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3 vomiting); 16% suffered WHO grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicity, but there were no life-threatening episodes and no treatment-related deaths. Carboplatin has modest activity against malignant mesothelioma and, because of its low toxicity, has a role in the management of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "During a 15-month period, 92 patients undergoing 129 treatment episodes of immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone or with immune cells underwent insertion of central venous catheters (CVCs) in the Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute. Before each catheter insertion patients were prospectively randomized into one of three treatment groups; therapy with intravenous (IV) placebo using D5W, IV oxacillin, or change of the catheter to a new site every 72 hours. The mean duration of catheterization was 3.8 +/- 1.1 days. No patient in the oxacillin arm developed catheter-related sepsis, while eight patients in the control arms (five, line change, three, placebo) developed catheter-related sepsis (P2 = .050). Seven episodes of catheter-related sepsis were due to Staphylococcus aureus and one was due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Catheter colonization was reduced significantly in the oxacillin arm versus control arms (P = .0001). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative Staphylococci were sensitive to oxacillin in 89%, 60%, and 50% of cultures, respectively. No evidence of bacterial overgrowth, candida colonization, or candidemia was observed in these patients. Thus this trial demonstrates that treatment with prophylactic oxacillin can decrease the incidence of catheter-related sepsis in patients undergoing immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2). To our knowledge this is the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate the prophylactic use of systemic antibiotics in the prophylaxis of CVC sepsis.\r"

  ".U": "90111794\r", 
  ".W": "The Goldie-Coldman model explaining the kinetics of tumor cell kill and drug resistance has a potential application in designing chemotherapy regimes. In this Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial we tested the alternation of two potentially noncrossresistant drug combinations with a concurrent drug combination in patients with limited small-cell lung cancer. The concurrent drug combination consisted of etoposide (VP-16), 75 mg/m2/intravenously (IV), days 1, 2, and 3; vincristine, 1.0 mg/m2/IV, days 1 and 8; Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), 40 mg/m2/IV, day 1; and cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m2/IV, day 1 (EVAC). The alternating combination consisted of VP-16, 100 mg/m2/IV, days 1, 2, and 3; and cisplatin (CDDP), 100 mg/m2/IV, day 1, alternating with vincristine, 1.0 mg/m2/IV, days 1 and 8; Adriamycin, 50 mg/m2/IV, day 1; and cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m2/IV, day 1 (VP-16/CDDP-VAC). Chemotherapy was administered at 3-week intervals for six cycles both before and after chest (5,000 rads/5 weeks) and whole brain radiotherapy (3,000 rads/2 weeks). One hundred ninety-nine patients received EVAC and 201 received the alternating combination. There was no significant difference in the response rate to the initial six cycles of treatment with EVAC (CR, 40%) versus the alternating combination (CR, 38%). There was no significant difference between the best response, EVAC (CR, 48%) and VP-16/CDDP-VAC (CR, 51%). Median survival for all randomized patients on EVAC is 15.1 months versus 16.5 months on the alternating combination (P = .58). Toxicities consisted primarily of bone marrow suppression, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, peripheral neuropathies, and alopecia. As in previous trials, the chest was the most common site of relapse (33%). There were no differences in the incidence and sites of relapse between the two treatment arms. These treatments appear equally effective at inducing remission and prolonging survival in patients with small-cell lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-four assessable patients with stage II-IV large-cell lymphoma (LCL) were treated with the combination chemotherapy regimen methotrexate with leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) between July 1981 and May 1986. The m-BACOD regimen substituted moderate-dose methotrexate (200 mg/m2 x 2) for the high-dose methotrexate used in the preceding M-BACOD regimen; all other drugs were administered as with m-BACOD. Eighty-two patients (61%) in the completed m-BACOD trial achieved a complete response (CR). With a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 62 patients (76%) continue in CR. Predicted survivals of 1, 3, and 5 years for the entire m-BACOD group are 80%, 63%, and 60%, respectively, with a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 74% for the patients who achieve CR. The results obtained with m-BACOD are comparable with those obtained in the preceding M-BACOD trial, which now has a median follow-up of 8.0 years. The reduction in methotrexate dosage in m-BACOD patients was not associated with an increased incidence of CNS relapse. Long-term follow-up of the 215 M/m-BACOD patients indicates that the regimens are not associated with an increased incidence of secondary malignancy. Prolonged follow-up also indicates that advanced-stage patients have a persistent rate of late relapse of about 7.0% per year for years 2 to 5 of their follow-up and that stage II patients have an approximate 2.1% per year rate of late relapse. Application of the previously described prognostic factor model to the 215 M/m-BACOD patients from the completed trials identifies a high-risk group of patients with a CR rate and predicted 5-year survival (38% and 24%, respectively) that are significantly worse than those of the group as a whole (65% and 57%, respectively).\r"

The trial consisted of 65 patients with advanced, unresectable NSCLC who had had no prior chemotherapy, were at least partially ambulatory (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status [PS] level 0-2), and who had adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. All patients received the same defined combination chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin) and the same defined dietary counseling with the addition of either three times daily oral hydrazine sulfate (60 mg) or placebo capsules. Hydrazine sulfate compared with placebo addition to chemotherapy resulted in significantly greater caloric intake and albumin maintenance (P less than .05). Considering all patients, survival was greater for the hydrazine sulfate compared with placebo group (median survival, 292 v 187 days), but the difference did not achieve statistical significance. In favorable PS patients (PS 0-1), survival was significantly prolonged (median survival, 328 days v 209 days; P less than .05) for hydrazine sulfate compared with placebo addition. In a multifactor analysis, PS, weight loss, and liver involvement were the final variables. Objective response frequency and toxicity were comparable on both arms. Hydrazine sulfate may favorably influence nutritional status and clinical outcome of patients with NSCLC. Further definitive studies of hydrazine sulfate addition to therapeutic regimens in NSCLC are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy previously untreated patients with stage II, III, and IV intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma were treated with methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) between September 1985 and November 1987. Forty-nine of these patients had diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), and eight of these patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Complete responses were achieved in 54% of all patients and 52% of those with DLCL. With follow-up extending to 36 months, 45% of all DLCL patients are alive, and 50% are still living, if the HIV-positive patients are excluded from the analysis. Chemotherapy was quite toxic. Seventy-five percent of patients had severe mucositis, 42% had peripheral neuropathy, 50% required hospitalization, and 54% experienced leukopenia with a WBC count below 1,000/microL. Seven percent (five patients) died of toxicity related to the chemotherapy. Our analysis of prognostic parameters indicated that B symptoms, a performance status below 80, and, to a lesser extent, elevation of serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) (in HIV-negative DLCL patients) were associated with an inferior survival. Advanced age, sex, and bulky disease were not found to have a statistically significant effect on survival. Our preliminary results indicate that MACOP-B chemotherapy is an effective regimen for high- and intermediate-grade lymphomas. However, the survival for patients with DLCL treated with MACOP-B is no different than that achieved with previous regimens at our institution.\r"

In seven female patients this practice led to a series of events including headache, pyrexia, seizures, cranial nerve deficits, endocrinopathy, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and an enhancing mass demonstrated by computerized tomography at the aneurysm site. One patient with blindness, hydrocephalus, and panhypopituitarism died and was examined at autopsy. Three additional female patients have been identified in the literature with similar case histories. It is suggested that in these patients the gauze induced a foreign-body granuloma, accompanied by progressive occlusion of neighboring small arteries. It would seem prudent to reserve gauze reinforcement for aneurysms that cannot be securely obliterated surgically.\r"

The patients with dissecting aneurysms were characteristically relatively young males. Twenty-one patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and three with ischemia. Severe headache or neck pain occurred in all three patients with ischemia. Five of the 21 patients with SAH and all three patients with ischemia experienced recurrent episodes. Angiography typically showed fusiform dilatation and proximal and/or distal narrowing of the affected artery. The difficulty of diagnosing this disorder is pointed out. Surgery was performed in 19 patients, the most common technique being clip-occlusion of the proximal vertebral artery. There were no postoperative deaths or rebleeding; a lateral medullary syndrome developed in three patients. The observation at surgery of intramural clot with characteristic discoloration was limited to the cases operated on within 36 days after the ictus. After this period, the aneurysm was whitish gray in color and had become firm. Of 36 other cases of vertebral dissecting aneurysm reported in the literature, 20 were operated on. The indications for surgery are discussed.\r"

All patients were referred for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism. The comparison revealed increased extrathoracic tracheal and mediastinal tracheal deposition but less central bronchial deposition in the artificially ventilated patients. Peripheral penetration in both groups of patients was excellent. Within the artificially ventilated group, peripheral penetration of activity seemed equally good in patients receiving positive-end expiratory pressure ventilation (n = 14) and those ventilated with normal pressures (n = 7). The frequency of regions in which aerosol activity (A) was present in the same zone as a perfusion (P) defect was the same in the controls and artificially ventilated patients (12% against 14%) but the frequency of the reverse type of mismatch (i.e., P greater than A) was significantly higher in the artificially ventilated group (42% against 14%, p less than 0.001). The results suggest that [99mTc]DTPA aerosol scans in artificially ventilated patients are associated with good peripheral penetration of activity and frequently yield valuable clinical information.\r"

The quantification is relative to a known-activity reference source. The scatter multiplier (\"k\" value) is determined for a radioactive 99mTc sphere on or off the axis of a cylinder containing water with or without background. Both maximum likelihood and filtered-backprojection reconstruction are employed. Either projections or tomograms are corrected. With tight regions of interest, there is a tendency for the requisite \"k\" value to be slightly lower as the diameter of the cylinder is increased. Neither sphere location nor background perturbs \"k\", however, so a constant value is a good, first approximation. Then a two-sphere validation test yields an accuracy of 8% with subtracted-tomograms (\"k\" = 1.30) and 2% with subtracted-projections (\"k\" = 1.20). With a reference-source region of interest which is four times larger, \"k\" is reduced and also now depends on background. Although equivalent quantitatively, maximum likelihood is preferable to filtered backprojection with Chang attenuation correction since it produces a less-noisy image.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the immediate and the longitudinal effects of exogenous surfactant therapy on pulmonary mechanics were evaluated in extremely premature infants during mechanical respiration. Ninety-four infants weighing between 600 and 1250 gm received either exogenous surfactant or sham (air) therapy in the delivery room and up to three additional doses in the first 48 hours of life if they were ventilator-dependent, had fractional inspiratory oxygen requirements greater than or equal to 0.30, and radiographic findings consistent with hyaline membrane disease. Each infant underwent pulmonary mechanics assessment (dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, tidal volume) immediately before and 1 hour after each dose, and at 24, 48, and 72 hours and 7 days of age. There were no significant differences in dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, and tidal volume in the surfactant (n = 47) and control (n = 47) groups before and 1 hour after each dose. However, dynamic compliance was 50% greater in the surfactant group at 24 hours of age (p less than or equal to 0.009); this difference steadily increased to 94% at 7 days of age (p less than or equal to 0.009). Oxygenation, assessed by the ratio of alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure, was significantly greater in the surfactant group during the first 72 hours of life; the greatest difference was noted at 24 hours (p less than or equal to 0.001). Mean airway pressure requirements in the surfactant group were significantly less than in the control group at all times during the first week. We conclude that exogenous surfactant therapy, administered at birth and during the first 48 hours of life in extremely premature infants with hyaline membrane disease, improves dynamic compliance and gas exchange during mechanical breathing.\r"

Studies of cell surface marker expression revealed remarkable changes after HIV-1 infection of Raji cells: expression of CR2 (C3d/EBV receptor, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD10, and surface IgM) were highly reduced, in the case of CR2 and membrane-IgM from 100 to 0%, whereas levels of CD37 and CD38 remained unaltered by HIV-1 infection. U937 cells showed a reduction of CD4 expression from 14 to 5% after HIV-1 infection; the CR3 expression slightly increased from 25 to 30%. In contrast, HLA-DR was only expressed (21%) after HIV-1 infection but not in uninfected U937 cells. Expression of HLA-DR could be detected also in HL60 cells (33%) after HIV-1 infection. In H9 cells, CD4 was reduced from 60 to 30% after HIV-1 infection, whereas HLA-DR and CD25/IL-2 receptor expression increased from 16 to 90% and from 0 to 50%, respectively. CD4 was reduced from 70 to 0% from Jurkat cells after HIV-1 infection, whereas expression of CR2 was only slightly diminished from 8 to 4%. Expression of CR1 and HLA-DR was slightly increased in these cells (1 to 3%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A simultaneous need is to assure access to care for patients with HIV infection who lack insurance or entitlement to health care benefits. We suggest new and practical payment mechanisms that can encourage the availability of comprehensive care for people with HIV infection. We suggest changes in state and federal payment policies that would make the cost of providing AIDS care more of a collective, community responsibility. We recommend mandated workplace insurance, extension of Medicaid eligibility to all with incomes below the federal poverty level, an opportunity for individuals with incomes to 200% of the poverty level to purchase Medicaid coverage, mechanisms to encourage public and private agencies to pay for continued health insurance after loss of employment, and a shortened waiting period for Medicare disability.\r"

  ".U": "90112014\r", 
  ".W": "A hypothesis is presented in which HIV infection leads to immunodeficiency through indirect subversion of critical T cell regulatory mechanisms. Acting at the T cell receptor complex (TCR), viral components (gp120) mimic the natural ligands of CD4, molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and deliver physiologically active, inappropriate signals resulting in generalized, uncontrolled lymphocyte activation, or \"panergy.\" Clinical manifestations of panergy include autoimmune phenomena, lymphadenopathy, hyperglobulinemia, and symptoms mediated by lymphokines. Immunologic unresponsiveness occurs early in HIV infection prior to T cell depletion because activated cells do not respond to further stimulation. Ultimately, activation disrupts T cell homeostasis by interference with the generation of memory cells (\"imnesia\") and leads to net T cell loss, clonal deletion, and the development of AIDS. The clinical and immunologic features of HIV disease and AIDS are reviewed from this perspective. This hypothesis is consistent with the paucity of infected T cells, the clinical findings of both AIDS-related complex (ARC) and frank AIDS, the prolonged \"incubation period,\" and a role for antigen-specific cofactors. Based on this view of HIV pathophysiology, therapeutic modalities should avoid immune stimulation and seek to block aberrant gp120 signals at CD4 and eliminate HIV-infected cells.\r"

HIV-1 antigen capture systems were useful for the detection of SIV antigenemia in experimentally infected macaques.

It exerts these effects by binding to steroid transport proteins in the circulation and to specific receptors in target tissues. Centrally, danazol inhibits gonadotropins, suppressing gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. Gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis are suppressed further through danazol's direct effect on specific enzyme systems. Danazol also displays immunoregulatory effects both in vivo and in vitro. In endometriosis, danazol induces amenorrhea and a hypoestrogenic state, resulting in endometrial atrophy. The drug's direct binding to androgen and progesterone receptors in endometriotic tissue may contribute further to the suppression of endometriosis. In women with endometriosis who produce autoantibodies against endometrial cells and endometrial cell-derived phospholipids, histones and nucleotides, danazol may improve reproductive performance through the suppression of abnormal autoantibody levels. In several other autoimmune and genetic disorders danazol brings about a clinical improvement by lowering abnormal autoantibody production or by increasing the concentration of genetically deficient protein. In order to explore the full clinical potential of the drug and to better understand danazol's mechanism of action and especially its immunoregulatory effects in autoimmune diseases and endometriosis, further investigation is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Several modalities can be employed in managing the patient with endometriosis, and ultimate selection hinges on a number of criteria, including age, extent of disease, severity of symptoms and pain. The current scoring system may underestimate the severity of the disease in some women. For instance, the system does not consider the presence of subtypes of endometriosis in individual patients. Endometriotic implants differ from uterine endometrium in terms of their response to the hormonal milieu and demonstrate a wide range of morphologic development, from poorly to highly differentiated glands. The number of estrogen, progestin and/or androgen receptors in endometriotic lesions may differ markedly from that in normal endometrium. These developments suggest not only problems with current scoring but the possibility of using such innovations as receptor studies to individualize therapy in the future. Danocrine (danazol), an isoxazol derivative of 17-alpha ethinyl-testosterone, when used at appropriate dosages, is an excellent drug for the treatment of endometriosis. Exercise has been demonstrated to markedly reduce the incidence of androgenic side effects that occur with danazol. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists also appear to be promising for this indication. Further research is needed with these drugs, especially in the area of combination therapy with danazol.\r"

Earlier treatments designed to reduce the pain, tenderness and nodularity associated with this condition met with little success. It was not until 1971, when Danocrine (danazol) was introduced for the treatment of endometriosis, that the potential usefulness of this synthetic steroid in the management of benign breast disorders was recognized. Numerous studies have substantiated the efficacy and safety of danazol for this application. At one center involved in a multicenter study of danazol, the drug was administered in dosages of 400 mg/d for two months, followed by 200 mg/d for an additional four months, to 25 women with fibrocystic breast disease. Eighteen (79%) of the women demonstrated a marked improvement in or elimination of their symptoms. The majority remained asymptomatic for at least one year after treatment. The side effects were mild and of the \"nuisance\" variety. These findings are consistent with the overall data reported by the other centers participating in the study.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 90% of women experience some symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS); in up to 40% of cases the symptoms are moderate to severe. The signs and symptoms of PMS usually wax and wane according to a four-phase temporal pattern. Within this overall schema there are a number of PMS subtypes. PMS typically manifests before the age of 30 and rarely resolves spontaneously. While genetic factors may play a role in the development of PMS, other epidemiologic factors do not seem to be involved. Various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed as causing PMS. They are an estrogen/progesterone imbalance, prolactin abnormalities, fluid retention, abnormal production of certain prostaglandins, hypoglycemia, pyridoxine deficiency and shifting levels of endorphins. However, the role of these factors in the etiology of PMS has not been established definitively; thus, treatment remains largely empiric. The author's experience with the use of Danocrine (danazol) on 21 patients with PMS suggests that this synthetic steroid, when used in conjunction with nonpharmacologic treatment options, relieves the symptoms of PMS in up to 85% of patients. Women whose PMS is characterized primarily by mastalgia appear to respond most favorably to treatment; danazol is not recommended for women with primary depression or anxiety symptomatology.\r"

Trauma patients constituted 15.2% of all PICU patients, and used 14.9% of patient care days and 14.5% of TISS points. Efficiency of trauma patient care was 75% overall compared to 79% overall for nontrauma patients (p less than 0.001). Trauma patient mortality was 9.8%. Tests for goodness of fit showed the PSI and PRISM scores to be accurate outcome predictors for trauma patients (PSI: chi 2 (4) = 2.852, p greater than 0.50; PRISM: chi 2 (4) = 1.216, p greater than 0.50). Trauma patients are a minority of PICU patients and deaths. Their resource use is proportional to their numbers, although less efficient than for nontrauma patients.

The intraoperative blood loss averaged 1.8 +/- 2.4 (SD) liters and patients were transfused 3 +/- 2 units of blood perioperatively. The amount of FG required to achieve splenic hemostasis averaged 11 +/- 8 ml and varied directly with the grade of injury. One patient with a splenic hilar vascular injury (Grade V) underwent splenectomy following failure to achieve complete hemostasis despite the use of 25 ml of FG. All other splenic injuries were successfully managed using less than 25 ml of FG. Postoperative computerized tomographic (CT) scanning, performed in ten patients, was negative for rebleeding or abscess formation. The overall splenic salvage rate was 86%. FG was effective in achieving hemostasis of both superficial and deep splenic injuries. Its use as an adjunct in trauma surgery should result in increased splenic salvage rates compared with that obtained using conventional surgical techniques.\r"

  ".U": "90112692\r", 
  ".W": "Noninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis has traditionally relied on detection of alterations in venous hemodynamics. Although phleborheography is among the most sensitive tests, it is inadequate for diagnosing infrapopliteal and nonocclusive proximal thrombi and for surveillance of patients at high risk for deep venous thrombosis. Venous duplex imaging is a new technique being rapidly accepted, however, without the same critical analysis given to previous diagnostic modalities. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic acumen of venous duplex imaging compared to phleborheography and ascending phlebography in two distinct patient groups, and to determine whether patient selection, and thus the location or magnitude of thrombi have significant influence on these diagnostic tests. One hundred ten extremities in 103 patients were prospectively evaluated with venous duplex imaging, phleborheography, and ascending phlebography within the same 24-hour period. Patients were categorized into one of two groups: Diagnostic--patients evaluated because of clinical suspicion of acute deep venous thrombosis; and Surveillance--patients at high risk of postoperative deep venous thrombosis after total joint replacement, but not symptomatic. Patients in the diagnostic group had a greater frequency of deep venous thrombosis (p less than 0.001) and significantly more occluding above-knee thrombi (p = 0.054) compared to those in the surveillance group. Phleborheography detected 73% (27/37) of above-knee thrombi in the diagnostic group compared to 29% (2/7) in the surveillance group (p = 0.036). This difference was not noted with venous duplex imaging, which detected 100% of above-knee thrombi in both diagnostic and surveillance groups and 78% (7/9) of all below-knee thrombi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the fate of free-floating venous thrombi, venous duplex scans of 5238 consecutive lower extremities over a 2 1/2 year period were reviewed. Acute deep venous thrombosis was found in 732 cases. Eighty-two free-floating deep venous thrombi were diagnosed in 73 of these patients. Nine of 72 patients (13%) had pulmonary emboli as diagnosed by ventilation perfusion scanning or pulmonary angiography or both. Seven of these patients (78%) had a pulmonary embolus before the initial duplex scan. Two (22%) had a pulmonary embolus after the diagnosis of free-floating thrombus. Thirty-three of 73 patients (45%) had follow-up of free-floating thrombi by duplex scanning performed in the acute period (less than 30 days): 18 (55%) showed attachment of the free-floating thrombus, three (9%) showed progression in size of the free-floating tail, and eight (24%) showed decrease in size or resolution of the free-floating thrombus. Four (12%) showed persistent thrombus without evidence of resolution, propagation, or attachment. In conclusion, free-floating venous thrombi occurred in 10% of cases of acute deep venous thrombosis. Only 13% of free-floating thrombi were associated with clinically significant pulmonary emboli, confirmed by ventilation perfusion scanning. Usually the embolus occurred before diagnosis of free-floating thrombus. Most free-floating thrombi followed noninvasively by duplex scanning do not embolize, but rather they become attached to the vein wall or resolve.\r"

During an average of 1.6 years of follow-up, 53 hip fractures occurred. The risk of hip fracture was inversely related to bone density at all three measurement sites. After adjusting for age, the relative risk of hip fracture was 1.66 for a decrease of 1 SD in the bone density at the calcaneus (95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 2.26), 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.11) at the distal radius, and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.88) at the proximal radius. None of the three measurements was a significantly better predictor of hip fracture than the others. After adjusting for bone mineral density, the risk of hip fracture doubled for each 10-year increase in age (relative risk, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 3.33). We conclude that decreased bone density in the appendicular skeleton is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, but this accounts for only part of the age-related increase in risk of hip fracture among older women.\r"

Use rates per 10,000 Medicare enrollees in a county varied from 13 to 158 for coronary angiography, 5 to 41 for carotid endarterectomy, and 42 to 164 for upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy. Inappropriate use varied by county from 8% to 75% for coronary angiography, from 0% to 67% for carotid endarterectomy, and from 0% to 25% for endoscopy. For coronary angiography, inappropriate use accounted for 28% of the variance in the county rate. For the other two procedures, no significant correlations were found between inappropriateness of use and rate of use. We conclude that little of the variation in the rates of use of these procedures can be explained by inappropriate use.\r"

From this population, 12 that employed multiple regression analysis with IQ as the dependent variable and lead as the main effect and that controlled for nonlead covariates were selected for a quantitative, integrated review or meta-analysis. The studies were grouped according to type of tissue analyzed for lead. There were 7 blood and 5 tooth lead studies. Within each group, we obtained joint P values by two different methods and average effect sizes as measured by the partial correlation coefficients. We also investigated the sensitivity of the results to any single study. The sample sizes ranged from 75 to 724. The sign of the regression coefficient for lead was negative in 11 of 12 studies. The negative partial r's for lead ranged from -.27 to -.003. The power to find an effect was limited, below 0.6 in 7 of 12 studies. The joint P values for the blood lead studies were less than .0001 for both methods of analysis (95% confidence interval for group partial r, -.15 +/- .05), while for the tooth lead studies they were .0005 and .004, respectively (95% confidence interval for group partial r, -.08 +/- .05). The hypothesis that lead impairs children's IQ at low dose is strongly supported by this quantitative review. The effect is robust to the impact of any single study.\r"

A statistically significant improvement was established between baseline and second follow-up on most objective and subjective quality-of-life parameters, including energy and activity level, functional ability, sleep and eating behavior, disease symptoms, health status, satisfaction with health, sex life, well-being, psychological affect, life satisfaction, and happiness.

Although withdrawn drugs accounted for 7% of prescriptions in the base year, there was no measurable reduction in overall drug use or expenditures after the regulation; prescription rates actually rose from 0.86 to 1.00 monthly prescriptions per enrollee throughout the 42-month study. Controlling for preexisting trends, an estimated drop in the use of study drugs of 21.7 prescriptions per 1000 enrollees per month was offset by an increase in the use of substitute drugs of 33.7 prescriptions. Both desirable and unimproved therapeutic substitutions were observed. Used alone, curtailment of reimbursement for marginally effective therapies results in both desirable and unintended clinical substitutions and may not reduce costs. Supplementing such restrictions with education may be necessary to promote practices that are more therapeutically and economically appropriate.\r"

The overestimate was largest with AN because with this method bone area cannot be excluded. To evaluate the usefulness of US measurements, 10 patients with advanced liver disease were studied. Measurement of MAFA by US, using triceps skinfold thickness as the standard, was found to be an accurate index of fat stores. MAMA measured by US correlated well with lean muscle mass, using creatinine height index as the standard. Ultrasonography is a reliable method of measuring body fat and lean muscle status.\r"

In humans, however, many TIL cell lines are not cytotoxic in vitro, and clinical trials thus far have been less than encouraging. We attempted to correlate TIL cytotoxicity with time of tumor harvest and TIL cell surface antigenic expression. TILs harvested from early MC-38 adenocarcinoma tumors (days 9 and 20 post-tumor implantation), demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor targets compared to older TILs (days 31 and 37). The younger TILs had a higher expression of the Lyt-1 (Helper T cells), asialo GM1 (NK and T cells), and 49H.8 (NK cells) antigens. Comparison with the MCA-102 sarcoma, a tumor that does not lead to cytotoxic TILs, revealed a low expression of the Lyt-1 antigen on their cell surface. We conclude that TILs cytotoxicity is time-dependent and may be dependent on the presence of Lyt-1+ cells in the overall TIL population of cells.\r"

The ratio of the forced expiratory volume at 1 second to the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) was the measure of baseline airflow. Using methacholine challenge, we tested 53 patients before conditioning chemotherapy, total-body irradiation, and BMT. All patients had a baseline FEV1/FVC of 70% or more. The mean baseline FEV1/FVC was 84(+)/- 6%. The response to methacholine challenge was defined by the change in FEV1 from baseline (delta FEV1). A positive response (delta FEV1 of 20% or more) occurred in 11 of 53 patients (21%), a borderline response of (delta FV1 of less than 20% but greater than or equal to 10%) was was found in 10 (19%), and no response (Delta FEV1 of less than 10%) was elicited in 32 (60%). In our group of patients with a positive or borderline response to methacholine, we found no significant relationship to baseline FEV1/FVC, smoking history, hematologic diagnosis or study, or major post-BMT pulmonary complications including bronchiolitis obliterans. We concluded that pretransplantation airway reactivity, as measured by methacholine challenge and in the setting of normal baseline FEV1/FVC, was common before BMT. The presence of a borderline or positive response to methacholine challenge before transplantation was not associated with the development of either clinical or pathologically proven posttransplantation bronchiolitis obliterans.\r"

Mammography, currently the most important breast imaging technique, was introduced at the Mayo Clinic in 1961. In 1988, more than 36,000 mammographic procedures were done. Breast ultrasonography is also a valuable examination, particularly for determining whether mass lesions are cystic or solid. The use of mammography for screening is increasing. Screening mammography allows the detection of breast cancer before it is palpable and while it is still in a stage known as minimal breast cancer. Lesions metastatic to axillary lymph nodes are less common in women with nonpalpable breast cancers than in women with palpable lesions. Nondiagnostic mammography should not delay the biopsy of a mass that is suspicious on physical examination. A special breast imaging center for performance of screening studies and evaluation of breast problems has been established at the Mayo Clinic.\r"

Recent clinical developments include the detection of asymptomatic paroxysms of hypertension by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, detailed characterization of catecholamine cardiomyopathy by echocardiography, and further experience with Carney's triad and other polyglandular and multiple neoplasia syndromes associated with pheochromocytoma. Refinement in interpretation of catecholamine measurements and the development of radionuclide scanning with m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have greatly enhanced our diagnostic acumen. Developments in antihypertensive drug therapy and chemotherapy have improved our management of cathecholamine hypersecretion and tumor growth, respectively, in inoperable patients and in the preparation of patients for anesthesia and surgical treatment. Flow cytometry to detect abnormal DNA histograms may prove particularly useful in predicting the malignant nature of the tumors.\r"

The diagnosis should be suspected when either spontaneous hypokalemia or easily provoked hypokalemia is found in a patient with hypertension. Hypokalemia in association with inappropriate kaliuresis, low plasma renin activity, and a high plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio are the findings on initial screening tests that should suggest primary aldosteronism. The diagnosis must be confirmed by demonstrating nonsuppressible aldosterone excretion in conjunction with normal cortisol excretion. The choice of therapy is based on distinguishing unilateral from bilateral adrenal disease. With a unilateral adrenal adenoma, surgical removal reverses the hypokalemia and frequently cures the hypertension. In most patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia who are treated surgically, however, hypertension persists; thus, the initial treatment in these patients should be pharmacologic.\r"

Environmental factor(s) exerting a primary effect at an early age, in most patients, cause the disease to manifest usually in teenagers or young adults. Secondary environmental factors may alter disease expression, severity, or influence relapse. Studies in identical twins provide the best evidence for the role of genetic factors in the cause of Crohn's disease. Changing trends in disease incidence (seen in many countries) provide strong support for environmental factors as playing a major influence in disease expression. We now require further laboratory and epidemiologic studies in family members at risk of disease, in migrants who move from low incidence areas to high incidence areas, and in area where Crohn's disease particularly is starting to appear. The clinician can play an important role by performing careful observations in patients with a view to uncovering new clues to disease etiology.\r"

  ".W": "Topical 5-ASA Agents. Observations that 5-ASA may be the clinically active component of sulfasalazine have stimulated extensive pharmaceutical efforts to develop a new class of agents for the treatment of the inflammatory bowel diseases. Both oral and rectal forms of 5-ASA have been designed, tested, and released for use in Europe and Canada. Only one rectal 5-ASA formulation is now commercially available in the United States. Studies with topical 5-ASA have demonstrated that this formulation is safe and effective for distal colitis, even in patients with disease refractory to standard therapy. Adverse effects of topical 5-ASA are minimal. However, optimal treatment doses have not been defined, relapse is common after withdrawal of therapy, and issues regarding maintenance regimens are not yet resolved. Other disadvantages include the expense and inconvenience of enema therapy. However, rectally administered 5-ASA is an appropriate initial therapy for the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis, or as a therapeutic option for refractory distal colitis. Data are insufficient to make recommendations regarding the use of topical 5-ASA in Crohn's disease. Whether this class of agents will be of benefit for Crohn's proctitis or for perineal disease must await further clinical trials. Oral 5-ASA Agents. There appears to be a well-substantiated benefit equivalent to that of sulfasalazine achieved by the new oral formulations of 5-ASA when used for the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and as maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis in remission. Adverse reactions to these agents are uncommon, usually mild, and infrequently require withdrawal of therapy. The major problem reported with these agents is watery diarrhea, most commonly associated with olsalazine, but the practical importance of this adverse effect is disputed. Rare occurrences of reversible pericarditis and acute pancreatitis have been encountered during clinical application of these agents. As more experience is obtained, these agents may become the initial therapy of choice for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and for maintenance in inactive disease. Currently available data have defined a role for these agents as an important alternative for the treatment of patients intolerant or allergic to sulfasalazine. As with sulfasalazine, these agents should not be used as the sole treatment for severely active ulcerative colitis. Many unanswered questions remain regarding therapy with these agents for ulcerative colitis. Still undefined are optimal drug dosages, appropriate dosing intervals, and the necessary duration of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with Crohn's disease eventually require an operation and the overwhelming majority will ultimately experience a postoperative recurrence at the anastomotic site. Endoscopic lesions can be seen at the anastomosis in 85 per cent of patients by 3 years after surgery. While only 40 to 50 per cent of postoperative patients will ever undergo a second operation, clinical manifestations of recurrent disease develop at a cumulative rate of about 10 per cent per year. Postoperative recurrences of Crohn's disease are well recognized even after total proctocolectomy and ileostomy, but rates are higher following reanastomotic procedures. Evidence accumulated from published observations over the past 20 years, reinforced by new data from The Mount Sinai Hospital, suggests that Crohn's disease may follow at least two different patterns: \"aggressive\" disease characterized primarily by fistulae and abscesses, early requirement for surgery, and relatively rapid fistulizing-type recurrence; versus \"indolent\" disease characterized mostly by fibrotic stenosis and strictures, late requirement for surgery, and relatively slower obstructive-type recurrence. Pathophysiologic investigations and clinical trials alike should take into account this duality of clinical patterns. Regardless of the patterns of recurrence, however, surgery performed for proper indications is almost invariably rehabilitating for people disabled by the ravages and complications of Crohn's disease.\r"

Dysplasia serves as a premalignant marker in some cases, and a surveillance program serves to find either dysplasia or the carcinoma. Until more specific premalignant changes are identified, endoscopic surveillance with multiple biopsies offers the best protection for the patient with longstanding ulcerative colitis against carcinoma. There is now sufficient evidence that this also pertains to Crohn's disease of the colon.\r"

  ".W": "In unselected patient populations with ulcerative colitis the overall prognosis is good and has improved over the years. There is still an appreciable excess mortality, however, particularly during the first years after diagnosis and it tends to increase with duration of disease. Patients with severe attacks, total colitis, and high age at diagnosis are particularly at risk. The disease runs an inactive or intermittent course in the majority of patients, although up to one fifth of the patients have a progress of the original extent of the colitis. Worldwide, there has been a time trend of decreased mortality possibly affecting younger patients in particular. Complications of the acute attack with or without surgery, liver disease, and colon cancer account for the major part of the colitis-related deaths whereas the mortality pattern in other respects does not differ significantly from that of the general population. The colon cancer incidence seems lower than previously reported but still accounts for approximately one tenth of all deaths. If this figure can be improved with cancer surveillance and prophylactic colectomy seems probable but remains to be shown. Pregnancy, if planned, should be encouraged when the patient is in remission although the disease or its standard treatment does not seem to dangerously affect the patient, fetus, or the newborn infant. Surgical and medical treatment probably accounts for most of the improvement in prognosis seen over the years. The postoperative mortality has been reduced, especially in series where new surgical procedures have been used. A high frequency of major postoperative complications still remains a challenge for improvement. The medical intensive treatment of the acute attack has contributed to the improved prognosis. If compliance is good, the sulfasalazine prophylaxis may be one of the explanations to the change into a milder disease pattern that has been observed recently. Finally, and most important, a majority of patients sustain a normal life with full working capacity. Those who have surgery adapt well, particularly when a continence-saving procedure is used. The sexual function follows the improvement although the patient's need for support and counseling should not be underestimated.\r"

However, if one bears in mind that rectal bleeding and mucosal abnormalities which are diffuse and uniform are the hallmark of ulcerative colitis, that Crohn's disease has perianal and external manifestations as its significant clinical hallmark, and both diseases tend to be chronic and recurrent, the clinical distinction can usually be made. However, it is important to recognize that there is an increasing awareness of intestinal infections, partly as a result of study of male homosexuals or patients with AIDS, as well as increased recognition of other infectious causes of diarrhea, including traveler's diarrhea, that associated with C. difficile, and that found with infection due to Campylobacter. As is usually the case in clinical medicine, however, careful and accurate history, attention to detail on physical and sigmoidoscopic examination, and laboratory (usually stool culture) data will lead to the appropriate diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Extraintestinal and systemic manifestations occur commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and affect most all organ systems of the body. The occurrence of such widespread manifestations strongly suggests that these disorders are systemic in nature and may have a common mechanism. Extraintestinal manifestations may be incidental findings that cause no symptoms, but more commonly complicate the management of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease, being a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Some extraintestinal manifestations not only correlate with a specific disease state but also with the location, extent, and degree of activity and disease. Most extraintestinal manifestations found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease involving the small intestine appear to correlate with some underlying pathophysiologic mechanism.\r"

For most patients the condition is benign, although periods of exacerbation can occur between remissions, characterized by rectal bleeding. However, extension of the disease, development of cancer, and the requirement of surgery are all relatively unusual. It has recently been recognized that there are many other causes of proctitis than the idiopathic form, and this has raised important questions in differential diagnosis, particularly in the proctitis occurring in homosexual males. Proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and distal colon ulceratice colitis and not Crohn's disease; conversely perianal fistulae and abscesses are rare in distal colon ulcerative colitis. Treatment with various forms of topical agents has often been satisfactory.\r"

Training increased exercise duration from 14.2 (1.1) min to 16.8 (1.3) min and peak oxygen consumption from 14.3 (1.1) ml.min-1.kg-1 to 16.7 (1.3) ml.min-1.kg-1. Heart rates at submaximum workloads and rate-pressure products were significantly reduced by training, and there was also a significant improvement in patient-rated symptom scores. No adverse events occurred during the training phase. Thus home-based physical training programmes are feasible even in severe chronic heart failure and have a beneficial effect on exercise tolerance, peak oxygen consumption, and symptoms. The commonly held belief that rest is the mainstay of treatment of chronic heart failure should no longer be accepted.\r"

Peripheral glucose uptake was not affected but glucose oxidation and alanine flux were increased by 15% and 10%, respectively. These findings are compatible with an increase in glycolytic flux by an action of bradykinin. Nineteen patients who had undergone major gastro-intestinal surgery were studied in a randomised trial of chronic (6 day) bradykinin administration. Patients in the bradykinin group had a significantly improved rate of nitrogen retention (cumulative N balance, -0.014 [SE 0.064] vs -0.175 [0.048] g N/kg) in controls and significantly better nutritional indices. Manipulation of metabolism in surgical patients by bradykinin may have beneficial effects on nitrogen and protein dynamics, possibly mediated by improved aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis.\r"

Serum parathyroid hormone levels rose. The findings suggest that the fall in serum calcium caused secondary hyperparathyroidism, resulting in a fall in serum phosphate. Serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels fell substantially, showing that gallium effectively suppressed bone turnover. The fall in hydroxyproline excretion preceded that in serum alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that suppression of bone resorption by osteoclasts preceded that of bone formation by osteoblasts. Alkaline phosphatase levels remained low throughout follow-up (85-141 days), so the effect of gallium seems to be long-lasting.\r"

Of the 80 fetuses left after reduction 75 (94%) have survived. In 3 cases ultrasound scanning showed cardiac activity in the injected fetus 20-30 min after the initial injection despite 2 min of asystole immediately after the injection; repeated injection, carried out the same day, led to fetal death in all 3 cases. Selective reduction of multifetal pregnancies for the three indications described is an ethically justifiable option for the management of multifetal pregnancy, to which there are no public policy obstacles.\r"

At birth, beta cells are immature, produce only a basal amount of insulin, and are unresponsive to glucose--but are sensitive to glucagon and arginine. beta cells of spontaneously diabetic BB rats were stimulated for the first 6 days after birth by glucose with glucagon or arginine to accelerate beta cell maturation, and possibly to induce antigen expression and tolerance. Over the first 200 days of life, only 23% of glucose and glucagon-treated BB rats, and 20% of glucose and arginine-treated BB rats developed diabetes, compared with 65% of untreated controls. This finding may explain the observation that children of mothers who have type 1 diabetes are three times less likely to develop the disease than children of fathers with type 1 diabetes. Earlier maturation of beta cells during the diabetic pregnancy may protect against diabetes in later life.\r"

Furthermore caffeine consumption was not associated with infertility in 1818 infertile women and their primiparous controls.\r"

The threshold of ICA detection was 4 JDF units. ICA were detected in the first sample of 26 (3.3%) of the relatives, compared with 12 (2.2%) of 540 controls (298 blood donors and 242 healthy children). ICA were detected in follow-up samples from a further 14 relatives. IDDM developed in 14 (35%) of the 40 relatives with detectable ICA at any time and in 2 (0.3%) relatives without detectable ICA. In all 5 relatives with peak ICA levels above 80 JDF units IDDM developed within follow-up of 7 years; survival without IDDM at 10 years was 27% among relatives with peak ICA levels of 20-80 JDF units and 82% for peak ICA levels of 4-20. The predictive value for IDDM development within 10 years ranged from 40% (threshold 4 JDF units) to 100% (80 JDF units) and the sensitivity from 31% (80 JDF units) to 88% (4 JDF units).\r"

  ".W": "During and after two similar incremental treadmill tests, one with increasing, the other with initially decreasing blood acidosis, plasma potassium was measured in 11 volunteers. Independent of increasing or decreasing hydrogen ion, lactate, or bicarbonate concentrations, plasma potassium rose in relation to muscular stress with nearly equal concentrations for comparable exercise intensities in both tests. During the first 3 min of recovery, plasma potassium fell rapidly in spite of nearly unchanged blood acidosis and significantly decreasing bicarbonate concentration. After the 5th min of recovery, plasma potassium concentration was even slightly below pre-exercise values despite severe metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that there was little or no effect of plasma hydrogen ion, lactate, or bicarbonate on plasma potassium concentration during and after exercise. We propose that plasma potassium is primarily regulated by intracellular effects of inorganic phosphate, pH, and temperature on (Na+-K+)-ATPase. We suggest that these results reflect a model of grand mal seizure-induced lactic acidosis. The noted low blood potassium concentrations despite the presence of severe metabolic acidosis secondary to epileptic seizure is thus suggested to reflect the \"normal\" post-exercise state of potassium concentration.\r"

The FE, F, and CN groups exhibited lower total cholesterol values than the control group but were not different from each other. HDL cholesterol was significantly increased after treatment in the FE and F groups as compared to the CN and C groups. Serum apo-B, LDL cholesterol, and LDL protein decreased significantly in the FE group but not the F group from baseline to 12 wk. VO2max increased and percent fat decreased only in the FE group.

RMR constitutes 60 to 75% of daily energy expenditure and is the energy associated with the maintenance of major body functions. TEF is the cumulative increase in energy expenditure after several meals and constitutes approximately 10% of daily energy expenditure. Most investigators, however, have examined the thermic effect of a single meal test (TEM). TEA is the most variable component of daily energy expenditure and can constitute 15 to 30% of 24-h energy expenditure. This component includes energy expenditure due to physical work, muscular activity, including shivering and fidgeting, as well as purposeful physical exercise. Participation in purposeful exercise (both acute and chronic) is a subcomponent of TEA and has been found to influence resting energy expenditure (RMR and TEM). Reports in the literature, however, are discrepant regarding the direction and magnitude of the effects of exercise and exercise training on RMR and TEM. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that have examined the effects of exercise on RMR and TEM are reviewed. Possible explanations for divergent results in the literature are discussed. The major focus of this review is directed to human studies, although pertinent animal work is included. The role of genetic variation, gender specific responses, and methodological considerations for future studies examining the relation among RMR, TEA, and TEM are considered. Although still controversial, purposeful physical exercise appears to influence resting energy expenditure in man.\r"

The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a comprehensive model of the oxygen transport system based on a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system and 2) to test the new model's ability to predict VO2max changes observed in studies that have manipulated [Hb]. The resulting model demonstrates that blood volume changes that accompany venesection or blood doping may account for the apparent lack of a consistent [Hb]:VO2max relationship. A 1 l drop in blood volume is predicted to reduce VO2max by approximately 20%. A decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 2.6 g.dl-1 is needed to achieve a similar decrement. The accuracy of the model in predicting VO2max changes was tested by comparing the variance of the differences between predicted and observed changes in 19 studies with the total within-subject variance for VO2max measurement. This analysis indicates that there was no significant difference between the changes in VO2max observed and those predicted if a measurement error of 6.3% or greater was assumed. Analysis of data in the literature using our modified lumped parameter model reinforces those studies that have found VO2max changes to parallel changes in total body hemoglobin. The model developed is potentially useful for more accurately predicting changes in VO2max from alterations in hemoglobin concentration and/or blood volume.\r"

The efficacy of a given drink is limited by the rate of absorption, which is in turn limited by gastric emptying. A myriad of factors influence gastric emptying. The influence of several of these factors (training status, exercise intensity, and carbohydrate composition) was investigated by repeated experiments using a nasogastric tube and a modification of the technique of George. A group of well-trained bicyclists and a group of untrained subjects performed similar experiments. Three different carbohydrate containing drinks (15 g.100 ml-1 glucose (G), 15 g.100 ml-1 maltodextrin plus 3 g.100 ml-1 fructose (MD), 7 g.100 ml-1 sucrose (I] and artificially sweetened water were compared during rest and 50 and 70% Wmax bicycling. Experimental design was crossover. There was a trend for the carbohydrate drinks to empty initially more slowly under the influence of exercise. Differences in drink volume remaining in the stomach were significant (P less than 0.05), with I at 10 min (70%, mean = 48.9%; rest, mean = 30.5%) and at 20 min (70%, mean = 28.9%; rest, mean = 23.8%) and with MD at 10 min (70%, mean = 71.1%; rest, mean = 55.9%). A similar trend was also seen with 50% Wmax exercise; however, this trend was only significant with MD at 10 min (50%, mean = 72.1%; rest, mean = 55.9%). Drink composition was a much stronger inhibitor of gastric emptying. However, all drinks emptied exponentially with fast-phase initial emptying rates. No differences in gastric emptying or secretion were observed between trained and untrained subjects.\r"

Eight males completed performance evaluation tasks (PET) consisting of maximum isokinetic strength and endurance, isometric strength, and electrically evoked force of the leg extensors, twice during each of two conditions. On day 1 (D1) of the control condition (C) subjects performed the PET, followed by strenuous exercise designed to deplete glycogen stores of the leg extensors. After consuming a mixed diet for 48h (days 2 and 3) they performed the PET again on day 4 (D4). The experimental condition (E) was identical to C, except that a strictly controlled low carbohydrate diet was consumed during Days 2 and 3. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis before the PET on D4 confirmed differences between conditions in intramuscular glycogen (426 +/- 43 vs 153 +/- 60 mmol glucose units.kg-1 d.w. for C and E respectively, P less than 0.001). Results obtained from the PET were not different between conditions on D4, nor within conditions when D1 and D4 were compared. Resting blood glucose, hematological variables indicative of hydration and acid-base status, and post PET blood lactate were similar for all trials. It is concluded that short-term, high-intensity exercise performance of glycogen depleted leg extensors is not impaired.\r"

This study was done to determine whether conjugated norepinephrine and epinephrine also increase. Fifteen dogs were randomly divided into training (N = 8) or sedentary (N = 7) groups. All dogs were exercised acutely for 5 min at 4 mph with a 12% grade, following a 3-min warm-up, before and after either a 12-wk training or a 12-wk sedentary period. Free and conjugated catecholamines were determined in blood drawn at rest and during acute exercise using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Before training, free norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and conjugated norepinephrine increased in plasma during acute exercise. Following the 12-wk training period, there were significant increases in free and conjugated dopamine and in conjugated norepinephrine in plasma taken at rest. There were no such increases in resting catecholamines after a 12-wk sedentary period. After either training or sedentary periods, dogs responded to acute exercise with an increase in free norepinephrine and a decrease in conjugated norepinephrine. Thus, after training both conjugated norepinephrine and dopamine, but not conjugated epinephrine, increased in plasma. The data suggest that sulfation of catecholamines increases as a result of exercise training.\r"

In PRE and POST, distance per stroke (SL), VO2, heart rate (HR), and post-swim blood lactate concentration (BL) were measured during a 365.8 m breaststroke swim at approximately 90% effort. Subjects also performed a tethered breaststroke swim with retarding forces of 6.27, 7.75, and 9.26 kg. The EXP group experienced a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in BL (mean +/- SE: 8.48 +/- 0.78 to 6.74 +/- 0.74 mmol.l-1), a decreased VO2 (3.60 +/- 0.15 to 3.27 +/- 0.14 l.min-1), an increase in SL (2.07 +/- 0.08 to 2.31 +/- 0.10 m.stroke-1), and an insignificant (P = 0.08) decline in HR (174 +/- 5 to 168 +/- 4 beats.min-1) during the free swim. The CON group showed no changes in BL, SL, or HR. During the tethered swim, there were no significant PRE-POST differences in VO2, HR, or BL for either group. In a separate group of swimmers (nine who shaved body hair and nine controls), removing body hair significantly reduced the rate of velocity decay during a prone glide after a maximal underwater leg push-off. It is concluded that removing body hair reduces active drag, thereby decreasing the physiological cost of swimming.\r"

Tests were administered in counterbalanced order on two separate days. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), ventilation (VE), and rate pressure product (RPP) were recorded at absolute workloads (1.0 and 1.5 l.min-1) as well as at relative workloads (50, 75, and 90% of VO2 peak). In addition, the CV variables were measured at rest and peak exercise for each position. At absolute submaximal levels, women had higher HR, VE, and RPP values in both positions, reflecting responses at a greater percentage of their maximum exercise capacity. At relative workloads, HRs were significantly lower at rest and at 75 and 90% VO2 peak in the SR position. Men had greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) and RPP in both positions, and RPP was significantly lower at rest and at 75 and 90% VO2 peak in the SR position. Women displayed lower VE at all relative workloads. At peak exercise, subjects achieved significantly higher peak heart rates on the upright cycle (UP = 163 bpm, SR = 157 bpm). The UP cycle was associated with higher levels of peak VO2. The ability to achieve a higher HR and greater VO2 at peak exercise suggests that the UP cycle ergometer may be a preferable mode to the SR ergometer for evaluating maximal exercise performance among patients with mild hypertension.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of active and passive recovery on the determination of the IAT before and after an endurance training program. Both before and after an 8-wk training program, nine subjects did two submaximal, incremental cycle exercise tests (30 W and 4 min per step) until LA was greater than or equal to 4 mmol.l-1. Blood was sampled repeatedly during exercise and for 12 min during the subsequent recovery period, which was passive for one test and active (approximately 35% VO2max) during the second test. An IAT metabolic rate and power output were calculated for the passive (IATp) and active (IATa) recovery protocols. On separate days, before and after training, five of the subjects exercised for 30 min at either the IATp or the IATa. Before training, IATa occurred at a higher (P less than 0.05) power output and absolute and relative VO2 compared to IATp. After training, VO2max and the power output and VO2 at IATa and IATp increased significantly; as a percent VO2max, IATp but not IATa increased. During the pretraining 30-min IAT rides, LA was higher during the IATa than the IATp test, but LA values did not change during the last 20 min of exercise. LA was similar for both 30-min IAT rides after training and did not change from 5 to 30 min of exercise. The LA steady-state concentrations ranged from 1.3 to 6.8 mmol.l-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four hours before exercise subjects consumed either 45 (L) or 156 (M) g of carbohydrate in isocaloric feedings and either 0 (P) or 312 (H) g of carbohydrate. Interval cycling was undertaken for 95 min, followed by a performance trial. Blood glucose had reached basal 1 h after all feedings; blood insulin had reached basal 3 h after ingestion of P, L, and M but was still 84% higher for H at the start of exercise. During exercise insulin averaged 48% higher for H than P. Blood glucose decreased 16% during exercise for P, L, and M, whereas for H there was a transient drop the first 15 min of exercise, after which glucose increased and remained constant throughout exercise. More carbohydrate oxidation occurred during exercise for H vs P, whereas results were similar for L and M. Ingestion of H improved performance by 15% as compared with P, whereas performance was similar for L and M. These results indicate that, despite elevated insulin at the start of and during exercise, consumption of 312 g of carbohydrate 4 h before moderately intense prolonged exercise can improve performance, perhaps via an enhancement of carbohydrate oxidation.\r"

Each subject was required to perform a half squat exercise with a barbell weight centered across the shoulders at two different cadences (1 and 2 s intervals) and three different loads (15, 22 and 30% of the one repetition maximum). Fifty repetitions at each experimental condition were recorded with an active optoelectronic kinematic data capture system (WATSMART) and a force plate (Kistler). Processing the data involved a photogrammetric technique to obtain subject tailored anthropometric data. The findings of this study were: 1) the maximal antero-posterior shear and compressive force consistently occurred at the lowest position of the weight, and the forces were very symmetrically disposed on either side of this halfway point; 2) the medio-lateral shear forces were small over the squat cycle with few peaks and troughs; 3) cadence increased the antero-posterior shear (50%) and the compressive forces (28%); 4) as a subject fatigues, load had a significant effect on the antero-posterior shear force; 5) fatigue increased all articular force components but it did not manifest itself until about halfway through the 50 repetitions of the exercise; 6) the antero-posterior shear force was most affected by fatigue; 7) cadence had a significant effect on fatigue for the medio-lateral shear and compressive forces.\r"

Arm exercise at a given workload is typified by cardiac output and oxygen consumption values slightly higher and heart rate, blood pressure, ventilatory and blood lactic acid responses that are significantly higher than those observed during leg exercise. Part of the increased physiological stress during arm exercise may be due to sluggish kinetics of oxidative metabolism and increased glycolysis leading to lactic acid production and accumulation in blood. This physiological state would lead to a cardiovascular and respiratory pressor effect. The limitations of VO2 adjustment in the arms are not due to cardiac or muscle blood flow limitations as these are quick to adjust and reach higher absolute levels than during leg exercise. Specific arm training increases the VO2 adjustment, and the physiological values in these subjects during arm exercise are similar to those observed during leg exercise.\r"

  ".W": "This review summarizes and contrasts the cardiovascular responses elicited during dynamic upper body exercise (UBE) with those associated with lower body exercise (LBE). Information was obtained from studies which utilized arm-crank and/or cycle ergometers. At any given submaximal oxygen uptake (VO2), cardiac output (Q) is similar for UBE and LBE; however, heart rate (HR) is higher and stroke volume (SV) lower during UBE. Peripheral resistance and systolic and diastolic blood pressure are greater during UBE. Maximal Q, HR, SV, workload, and VO2 are less for UBE. As observed with healthy individuals, cardiac patients experience greater physiological stress for any given VO2 during UBE. UBE offers a satisfactory but perhaps not equivalent alternative to LBE for evaluation of angina and ischemic responses to exercise. The central and peripheral responses to either upper or lower body exercise appear to be independent of the muscle mass but directly related to the ergometer specific relative exercise intensity. The control mechanisms which govern these responses appear to be a centrally mediated activation of medullary centers coupled with a chemoreflex arising in the exercising skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "This paper will consider human thermoregulatory response differences between upper and lower body exercise. In addition, the thermoregulatory problems of spinal cord injured individuals are examined. For able-bodied individuals, the rise in core temperature is independent of the skeletal muscle mass employed and dependent upon the metabolic rate during exercise. The avenues of heat exchange, however, are different for individuals performing upper body as opposed to lower body exercise. During upper body exercise, there is a greater dry heat loss from the torso; however, no additional heat loss (as compared to lower body exercise) occurs from the exercising arms. If an individual performs upper body exercise in cold water, there will be a greater heat loss and susceptibility to hypothermia than during lower body exercise. A spinal cord injury impairs one's ability to thermoregulate because of: (a) loss of autonomic nervous system control for vasomotor and sudomotor responses in the areas of the insensate skin; (b) a reduced thermoregulatory effector response for a given core temperature; and (c) a loss of skeletal muscle pump activity from the paralyzed limbs. As a result, a spinal cord injured person has a reduced ability to tolerate thermal extremes and to perform aerobic exercise. Surprisingly little research, however, has focused on the ability of the disabled to thermoregulate during exercise. Recent data suggest that rectal temperature measurements may underestimate the thermal burden imposed on wheelchair athletes during competition.\r"

There is now evidence to suggest that initial fitness, as well as the intensity, frequency, and duration of training, may be important variables in determining the extent of cross-training benefits from the legs to the arms, and vice versa. Nevertheless, the limited degree of transfer of training benefits from one set of limbs to another appears to discount the practice of emphasizing leg training alone. Aerobic exercise programs for the upper body may yield significant central (Q and SV) and peripheral (a-vO2 difference) adaptations to support improvements in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) during arm and leg work, especially in subjects who are initially unfit, with the more dominant effects specific to the upper extremities. Finally, an arm exercise prescription that is based on the maximal heart rate derived from leg testing may result in an inappropriately high target heart rate for arm training. Workloads (kg.m.min-1) considered appropriate for leg training will generally need to be reduced by 50-60% for arm training.\r"

Thus, cardiopulmonary (aerobic) fitness is difficult to develop and maintain; this situation can often be exacerbated by a sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this paper is to present research related to exercise capability of wheelchair users, arm exercise modes, physical fitness training programs using arm exercise, and newly developed exercise techniques which incorporate combinations of voluntary arm exercise and functional neuromuscular stimulation-induced exercise of paralyzed leg muscles. It is evident that exercise training programs utilizing appropriate techniques can markedly improve the physical fitness, functional independence, and rehabilitation outcome of wheelchair users.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of the satellite cell, discovered by Alexander Mauro, is of fundamental importance in postnatal skeletal muscle development, muscle adaptation to certain activity stimuli, and to muscle fiber regeneration following injury and transplantation operations. There are numerous mitogens and growth factors that influence satellite cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and likely in vivo. The best understood purified growth factors are fibroblast growth factor (FGF), the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and -II), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Soluble extracts from injured muscle and chronically stretched muscle are also known to be mitogenic and are yet to be purified. Skeletal muscle development, hypertrophy, and regeneration can be viewed as points on a continuum with respect to the regulatory mechanisms of myogenic cell growth. The occurrence of fiber hyperplasia differs amongst some models of activity-induced growth and may reflect differences in the magnitude of the stimulus relative to the capacity of fibers to adapt. The relationships between the mechanical and environmental events coincident with an activity or injury stimulus and the role of specific muscle fiber satellite cell populations and growth factors are fertile areas for investigation. Insights from these experiments will yield a comprehensive understanding of the muscle growth process at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, and have implications for development and aging, health, disease, and adaptation.\r"

  ".U": "90113855\r", 
  ".W": "Satellite cells play an integral role in normal development of skeletal muscle by providing a source for postmitotic myonuclei and in repair of injured myofibers by serving as the source of myoblasts that participate in the regeneration response. The population of satellite cells in a muscle undergoes an ordered change both in relative and absolute numbers over the course of the postnatal growth period. Quantitative studies have shown that the changes are not the same among muscles or even among the individual myofibers within a muscle. In general, oxidative muscles have a much higher density of satellite cells than do glycolytic muscles. Although the exact reasons for the differences in the population densities are unknown, differences in the growth patterns of muscles or in their activity levels may be related factors. These differences point to the fact that the mechanisms that regulate satellite cell mitotic and fusion behavior are also not the same in all muscles. The activity state of muscle is an important factor in the regulation of satellite cell behavior. Increased functional demand that induces a hypertrophic response results in increased satellite cell mitotic activity, and decreased activity that results in atrophy results in decreased mitotic activity. Finally, elevated satellite cell mitotic activity can be a sensitive indicator of muscle damage, especially when the damage is minimal and difficult to detect by morphological means.\r"

Developmental repression of the ventricular MHC expression occurs earlier in embryonic fast twitch posterior latissimus dorsi (PLD) than in embryonic slow-tonic anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD) muscles. Ventricular MHC expression also occurs in developing myotube cultures and in regenerating ALD muscles. Following the application of a weight overload, a population of nascent myofibers emerges in ALD but not PLD muscles which express a ventricular MHC. Localization of cells reactive with anti-ventricular and anti-fast MHC antibodies suggests that satellite cells participate in nascent myofiber formation. In addition, some mature ALD muscle fibers demonstrate reactivity with these antibodies, suggesting that satellite cell fusion with mature myofibers also occurs in overloaded ALD muscles and results in the reinitiation of the embryonic phenotype in hypertrophying fibers. The presence of cells reacting exclusively with the anti-fast antibody after removal of the overload for 9 wk indicates that nascent myofiber formation results in the establishment of a new myofiber population with an abnormal phenotype in overloaded ALD muscles. These cells form a lattice-like network around normal fascicles.\r"

Studies of the ultraendurance triathlete fall into the following categories: 1) general physical and physiologic characterizations, 2) metabolic responses to prolonged exercise, and 3) the relationship of physiologic test variables to actual competitive performance. Physically and physiologically, triathletes tend to resemble other endurance athletes, with many characteristics similar to elite endurance cyclists. VO2max is widely variable in triathletes and has been reported to range from 40 to 85 ml.kg-1.min-1. The physiologic bases for success in ultraendurance triathlons are not clearly understood at this time. Physiologic variables that have been investigated include VO2max, cycling economy, %VO2max, and %HRmax at lactate and ventilatory thresholds and sustained %HRmax under actual race conditions. Although all of these factors appear to interrelate to influence actual triathlon race performance, the exact interrelationship is unclear at this time.\r"

Nutritional concerns can be divided into two major areas: nutrition during training and nutrition in preparation and during competition. Energy intakes of ultraendurance triathletes during training may vary widely, depending upon duration, intensity, and type of exercise training. Inadequate caloric intake can lead to chronic fatigue, weight loss, and impaired physical performance. Additionally, carbohydrate content of the diet can greatly influence feelings of fatigue. It is not known whether inadequate carbohydrate following exercise limits subsequent training efforts on the same day for triathletes. Inadequate micronutrient intake of vitamins and minerals can also impair physical performance. Nutrition during the 4 h before competition can significantly affect performance, as can carbohydrate feedings during an ultraendurance race. Further research is needed to determine appropriate feeding schedules during ultraendurance events.\r"

To further define these changes and to investigate the effects of maximal conditioning, we studied ultraendurance triathletes training for the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon using echocardiography, Doppler ultrasound, and electrocardiography. In this population, the left ventricle (LV) was of normal size but had increased wall thickness and mass. Systolic function was normal and diastolic function was normal or supernormal (increased ratio of rapid to atrial LV filling velocities). The finding of a pattern of concentric hypertrophy was reinforced by a close relationship between submaximal exercise systolic blood pressure and LV mass (r = 0.88). Examination of valvular function by Doppler ultrasound revealed significantly increased prevalences of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation in athletes, with 91% of athletes (vs 38% of controls) having regurgitation detected in at least one cardiac valve. Analysis of athletes using standard electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy showed that these criteria did not reliably detect increased mass. However, changes such as marked QRS prolongation and nonvoltage criteria for LV hypertrophy and RV hypertrophy may be useful in separating physiologic from pathologic hypertrophy. Our studies provide additional descriptions of cardiac changes produced by ultraendurance exercise training and suggest that the hemodynamic load imposed by exercise may be a contributing cause to physiologic hypertrophy. Much yet remains to be learned about the cardiac adaptation to exercise training.\r"

In contrast, young (10 day) heterozygous mdx mice showed neighboring dystrophin-negative and dystrophin-positive fibers as well as fibers with a discontinuous or patchy dystrophin labelling. Older heterozygotes displayed very few negative fibers, with most fibers exhibiting apparently complete dystrophin immunostaining. This, coupled with the absence of muscle fiber degeneration at any age point, and the apparently normal levels of dystrophin in older heterozygous mice, indicates that myonuclei containing the dystrophin gene can compensate for myonuclei which do not contain the dystrophin gene within the same myofiber.\r"

Corticosteroid treatment remained available to all the patients. All six patients withdrawn from the study because of severe eye disease were receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). Azathioprine was superior to placebo in the prevention of new eye disease in group 1 (1 vs. 8 patients; P less than 0.01) and in group 2 among the 14 patients who at entry had disease in only one eye (P less than 0.001). There were fewer episodes of hypopyon uveitis (1 vs. 15; P less than 0.001) among the group 2 patients who took azathioprine. The patients taking azathioprine also had less frequent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and arthritis. There were no serious side effects attributable to azathioprine.

  ".W": "The survival, differentiation, proliferation and development of haemopoietic precursor cells and the functional activity of mature blood cells are all influenced by colony stimulating factors (CSFs). As haemopoietic cells rapidly die in the absence of appropriate CSF, the promotion of cell survival mediated by CSFs, or growth factors, is fundamental to all the other effects exerted by these factors. This enhancement of cell survival is distinct from the stimulation of proliferation. Here we show that the death of haemopoietic precursor cells on withdrawal of the relevant CSF. is due to active cell death, or apoptosis, indicating that CSFs promote cell survival by suppression of the process of apoptosis. The existence of a positive control mechanism regulating precursor cell survival has important implications both for the regulation of normal haemopoiesis and for tumorigenesis.\r"

Mutational inactivation of the proteases of HIV-1 and other retroviruses results in immature, non-infectious virions, indicating that exogenous inhibition of the protease may represent an attractive approach to anti-AIDS therapy. Here we demonstrate that synthetic peptide analogues, which are potent inhibitors of purified HIV-1 protease, inhibit the processing of the viral polyproteins in cultures of HIV-1-infected T lymphocytes and attenuate viral infectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), a much milder form of the disease where the age of onset can sometimes be as late as the third or fourth decade of life, are caused by mutations in the same X-linked gene, a 14 kilobase (kb) transcript which is spread over more than 2 megabases of the human X chromosome. The corresponding protein, dystrophin, has a relative molecular mass of 400,000. Most mutations causing DMD and BMD are deletions and deletions associated with both phenotypes are observed throughout the gene sequence. This observation led to the suggestion that DMD patients possess deletions that disrupt the reading frame of the protein, whereas BMD patients have deletions that retain the translational reading frame and enable the muscle cells to produce altered dystrophin products. This theory is supported by immunoblotting studies, which show that DMD patients lack dystrophin in their muscle cells or that dystrophin is present at very low levels, whereas BMD patients produce a protein with reduced abundance or abnormal size. Here we describe a deletion of the dystrophin gene in a family segregating for very mild BMD, one member of which was still ambulant at age 61 years, which removes a central part of the dystrophin gene encompassing 5,106 base pairs of coding sequence, almost half the coding information. Immunological analysis of muscle from one of the patients demonstrates that this mutation results in the production of a truncated polypeptide localized correctly in the muscle cell. These results are particularly significant in the context of gene therapy which, if it is ever envisaged, would be facilitated by the replacement of the very large dystrophin gene with a more manipulatable mini-gene construct.\r"

This has implications relevant to pathogenesis and to projected secular trends of ALS incidence since the introduction of poliomyelitis vaccines. There is a need to establish the incidence of cases of classic ALS in patients with antecedent poliomyelitis.\r"

In addition, the mean glutamate concentration was significantly increased in the CSF of living HD patients as compared with controls. Neurochemical studies also showed that neither aspartic acid, proline, 5-oxoproline, nor homocysteic acid is likely to act as a causative excitotoxin in HD. Excessive striatal glycine content, or deficient glutathione content, is unlikely to contribute to the effects of a causative excitotoxin in HD. We suggest that glutamic acid may be the proximate causative neurotoxin in the striatum in HD, as a result of an unexplained failure in the reuptake mechanism for glutamate released there as an excitatory neurotransmitter.\r"

All belonged to a high-risk category for ovarian carcinoma because of nulliparity; family history of ovarian, breast, or endometrial carcinoma; previous cancer; or unspecified abdominal complaints. Of 638 patients with normal scans, findings at pelvic examination had been abnormal in 51 cases, and all were normal at subsequent clinical follow-up. Among 163 patients with abnormal ultrasound scans, one case of borderline ovarian tumor and two cases of endometrial cancer were found for which the pelvic examination had been considered normal. Clinical symptoms probably would have led to detection within a short time in these cases anyway, even if ultrasound had not been performed. Based on the findings in this study and the previous experience with gynecologic ultrasound in several thousand patients, it would not seem that ultrasound has a role in screening for ovarian carcinoma.\r"

The uterine fundus was the region most commonly perforated, and the anterior myometrium was the site most frequently penetrated. In all cases in which postoperative ultrasound showed malpositioning, the clinical and radiographic assessment indicated proper intracavitary placement. Ultrasound affected clinical management in 42% (21 of 50) of the placements involving 61% (17 of 28) of the patients. To improve tandem placement, we used intraoperative real-time ultrasound to guide 73 consecutive surgical insertions. Ultrasound clearly visualized the procedure, allowing tandems to be positioned with confidence even in the most difficult cases. The immediate feedback from intraoperative ultrasound eliminated malplacements and thus the need for a second anesthesia to reposition the tandem.\r"

The effects of pregnancy on diabetic retinopathy are unclear, but recent studies suggest that pregnancy may be less harmful to the retina of the diabetic subject than was thought previously. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that at least some women experience a worsening of their retinopathy as a result of pregnancy. Thus, careful ophthalmic evaluation and follow-up are essential for the pregnant woman with diabetes. This should include a minimum of one complete eye examination every trimester and within 3 months postpartum. Color fundus photography and laser treatment are safe, whereas fluorescein angiography, although commonly used to evaluate retinal vascular disease, can usually be avoided during pregnancy.\r"

We examined our experience with MSAFP screening in 71,563 unselected pregnancies in which karyotyping was performed when amniocentesis was done because of MSAFP elevations. A total of 727 women (1.0%) underwent amniocentesis because of elevated MSAFP values and among this group, seven chromosomal anomalies (incidence one in 104) were detected. Of the 727 women, 658 (91%) had normal amniotic fluid AFP. In this group, there were six (one in 109) chromosomally abnormal fetuses: three with triploidy, two with 47,XXX, and one with 46,XX,1q-. Among the 69 pregnancies with elevated amniotic fluid AFP, one fetal chromosomal anomaly (trisomy 13) was diagnosed. The incidence of all chromosomal anomalies observed in women undergoing amniocentesis because of elevated MSAFP is comparable to that reported in women 36 years of age undergoing testing because of advanced maternal age. We believe that chromosome analysis should be performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained because of elevated MSAFP unless there are compelling financial circumstances that preclude this. Even in such cases, cell cultures should be established until the amniotic fluid AFP result is available. Chromosome analysis is essential when the amniotic fluid AFP is elevated because of the known association between open fetal defects (spina bifida, omphalocele, and scalp defects) and trisomies 13 and 18.\r"

  ".U": "90114930\r", 
  ".W": "The classification of salivary gland tumors relies heavily on histogenetic postulates. One of these, the semipluripotential reserve cell theory, suggests that certain reserve cells in specific segments of the duct system of major and minor salivary glands are critical to the development of neoplasms in these glands. However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is unavailable. This survey of proliferative capacity in normal salivary gland is based on a review of data in the literature, our observations of DNA synthetic and mitotic activity in developing rat and human salivary gland, and autoradiographic studies of induced cell proliferation in rat salivary gland. Autoradiography of neonatal rat salivary gland after tritiated thymidine administration, and electron microscopy of these tissues, reveals that as well as duct basal cells, luminal cells at all levels of the duct system and even acinar cells are capable of DNA synthesis and mitosis. Indeed, in such studies, more luminal than basal cells are seen in mitosis. In adult rat salivary gland induced to undergo hyperplasia, more acinar cells than intercalated duct cells are in the S phase of the cell cycle. However, cycling cells were observed even in striated ducts and, importantly, both basal and luminal cells of major interlobular excretory ducts are also labeled. Similar findings are present in fetal and adult human salivary glands. From such observations, it is evident that dividing cells are not limited to basal cells of excretory ducts and luminal cells of intercalated ducts, so that there is no support for the semipluripotential bicellular reserve cell hypothesis. However, there is considerable evidence for a multicellular theory of tumor histogenesis; that is, any of the multiplicity of cell types in normal salivary gland have the potential to give use to any of the various types of tumor occurring in this organ.\r"

Achievement of peak bone mass in the first three decades of life through adequate nutrition and exercise is considered essential for prevention. Once osteoporosis is established as a disease entity, a variety of medical therapies have proven efficacy. Sex hormone replacement in the estrogen- or testosterone-deficient patient can maintain and in certain cases augment skeletal mass and reduce fracture incidence. The benefits of cyclical estrogen therapy are of limited duration and risks of accelerating the growth of established breast cancer have not been defined. The route of administration may affect the risk to benefit ratio of estrogen on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Calcitonin is effective in preserving bone mass for a short duration (18 months); the long-term effects, especially on fracture rate, are unknown. The benefits of a number of agents including vitamin D, thiazides, and bisphosphonates are unproven. Agents with apparent benefit, such as fluoride, can produce abnormal bone and may protect select regions (spine) while increasing the risk of fracture in others (hip). New and established medical treatments are evolving that provide hope for safer, more effective therapies.\r"

After fracture occurs, however, a simple plain roentgenogram usually suffices to make the diagnosis of compression fracture. If severe deformity threatens, or if there is a neurologic lesion, the surgeon now has options not previously available. Open reduction, decompression, and internal fixation with polymethylmethacrylate can be carried out safely by surgeons with expertise in spinal instrumentation. Generally, symptomatic treatment is all that is required, and if this includes an orthosis, it is an individual decision which can probably be made without fear of harming the patient further. With treatment of the acute fracture undertaken, one proceeds to employ whatever pharmacologic treatment is appropriate. Last, the patient should be allowed only the briefest period of rest.\r"

  ".W": "Paget's disease of bone is defined as a process of increased bone remodeling; the primary event is increased resorption (osteoclastic activity) followed by subsequent reactive bone formation (osteoblastic activity). It is usually asymmetric and may be asymptomatic. The etiology is unknown, but recent evidence appears to support the theory that a virus is an important etiologic factor. It may present with a wide variation in the clinical and radiographic picture. The most frequent sites of involvement include the spine, femora, cranium, pelvis, and sternum. The most common complaints are pain, skeletal deformity, and change in skin temperature. Pathologic fractures may be the presenting manifestations or complications in a patient with known Paget's disease. They occur most frequently in the long weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities such as the femoral neck and subtrochanteric and tibial regions. The two major therapeutic agents available for treatment are calcitonins (porcine, salmon, or human) and diphosphonates. The aim of such therapy is to control the metabolic activity of the disease, to normalize the biochemical parameters, and to improve the symptoms. Fortunately, tumors are rare; early diagnosis may give rise to more effective palliation, if not a significant cure rate.\r"

Disease heterogeneity and until recently the absence of appropriate techniques prevented detailed analyses of the underlying defects in this disease. Among the questions that must be asked are: (1) Are the cells in the osteoporotic bone functioning normally? (2) Is the matrix produced by these cells normal? (3) Is the pattern of mineral deposition normal? If not, how do each of these differ from normal, what is the effect of that abnormality, and how can it be prevented or corrected? Through answering these questions the scientific community will learn the function of many of the matrix proteins and may gain insight into revolutionary new therapies. The tools of human bone cell culture, new imaging techniques, analyses in biopsy samples, and other aspects of modern biotechnology are now available to start answering these questions.\r"

  ".W": "Precise maintenance of the physiologic levels of both extracellular and intracellular ionized calcium is essential to life. Calcium and phosphate homeostasis is complex, yet three important hormones are responsible for modulating most of the extracellular control of these minerals. Parathyroid hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine to maintain or restore the serum calcium level. The signal for increased PTH synthesis and secretion is a decrease in the serum ionized calcium concentration and a decrease in serum levels of 1,25(OH)2-D. Calcitonin is produced in parafollicular cells of the thyroid and inhibits bone resorption in pharmacologic doses. These cells recognize the calcium signal in a different way. A diminution in serum calcium decreases calcitonin production and release. The role of calcitonin in normal human physiology, however, remains in dispute. Finally, the biologically potent metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2-D, stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. It also probably plays a role in the orderly mineralization and resorption of bone and has some influence on renal resorption of filtered calcium and phosphorus. A major stimulus to its production by proximal renal tubule cells is elevated PTH and decreased serum levels of calcium and phosphate. The absence of PTH as well as high serum calcium and phosphate levels can reduce its synthesis and secretion. These three hormones along with other mediators and messengers work in concert to maintain the normal calcium homeostasis. A disturbance at any level in this intricate regulatory network will result in a host of compensatory changes that may lead to clinical disease. A complete understanding of these normal mechanisms is a prerequisite to investigating the etiology and treatment of the various pathologic responses seen with many of the metabolic bone disorders.\r"

The diseases that result from numerous mechanisms present with a symptom-sign-radiographic complex with such a high degree of stereotypy that laboratory investigation is often required to distinguish one form from another. The disorders in children, known as rickets, produce bowing and other deformities of the long bones and dwarfism. These disorders are principally related to the profound effect of the deficiency states on the epiphyseal plate; whereas the same disorders in adults produce an often severe osteopenia and pathologic fractures. Because of newer developments in our understanding of the factors affecting calcium-phosphorus hemostasis and vitamin D metabolism, many of the children and adults with these disorders can now be treated effectively.\r"

The clinical presentation of cortisol excess is one of progressive demineralization, primarily of trabecular bone, resulting in fractures of the vertebral bodies and ribs. Bone dissolution is greatest during the initiation of steroid therapy and can result in the loss of up to 20 per cent of trabecular bone in the first year. Bone loss slows with prolonged therapy; cortical bone is relatively spared so that appendicular skeleton fractures are not typically a part of this syndrome. The rate of bone loss is greatest in those individuals who have high bone remodeling rates. Histologically, one finds decreased trabecular volume and increased bone resorption with an increase in osteoclast number and activity, along with decreased bone formation and mineralization rate. Adjuvant medical therapies that block accelerated bone resorption may protect against steroid-induced osteoporosis.\r"

In the Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control Study, those risks for malformations were evaluated. The population-based study included 4929 live and stillborn babies with major malformations ascertained by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program in the first year of life born to residents of Metropolitan Atlanta between 1968 and 1980. The study also included 3029 nonmalformed live babies who were frequency-matched to case babies by race, period of birth, and hospital of birth. The relative risk for major malformations among infants of mothers with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (n = 28) was 7.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]1.9, 33.5) compared with infants of nondiabetic mothers. The relative risks for major central nervous system and cardiovascular system defects were 15.5 (95% CI = 3.3, 73.8) and 18.0 (95% CI = 3.9, 82.5), respectively. The absolute risks for major, central nervous system, and cardiovascular system malformations among infants of diabetic mothers were 18.4, 5.3, and 8.5 per 100 live births, respectively. Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus who required insulin during the third trimester of pregnancy were 20.6 (95% CI = 2.5, 168.5) times more likely to have major cardiovascular system defects than infants of nondiabetic mothers. The absolute risk for infants of this group of diabetic mothers was 9.7%. No statistically significant differences were found among infants of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus who did not require insulin during pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 209 patients studied, 115 were reviewed prospectively and 94 retrospectively. Pneumonia was radiographically diagnosed in 16 patients. Individual clinical factors were not found to be highly predictive of pneumonia. However, infants with the following nine factors did not have pneumonia; illness in the summer months; absence of cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress (grunting/flaring/retracting); respiratory rate less than 60; absence of rales and decreased breath sounds; presence of normal color; and white blood cell count less than 19,000/mm3.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral hemorrhages, hemorrhagic contusions, and bilateral subtemporal subdural hematomas. This is the first reported case of SBS diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging following a normal initial CAT scan. MRI may be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of brain injury in SBS and may be particularly valuable when the CAT scan of the head is normal, the etiology of neurologic injury is unclear, and the presence of retinal hemorrhages raises the suspicion of SBS.\r"

Initial antibiotic therapy must be individualized and should include an agent or agents active against the common pathogens encountered in the specific clinical setting. Once the causative organism is isolated, therapy is targeted more narrowly. Despite the availability of a variety of newer antibiotics, the morbidity and mortality of septicemia and septic shock remain unacceptably high.

The vectors used in this system contain a P1 packaging site (pac) to package vector and cloned DNA into phage particles, two P1 loxP recombination sites to cyclize the packaged DNA once it has been injected into a strain of Escherichia coli containing the P1 Cre recombinase, a kanr gene to select bacterial clones containing the cyclized DNA, a P1 plasmid replicon to stably maintain that DNA in E. coli at one copy per cell chromosome, and a lac promoter-regulated P1 lytic replicon to amplify the DNA before it is reisolated. An essential feature of the cloning system is a two-stage in vitro packaging reaction that packages vector DNA containing cloned inserts into phage particles that can deliver their DNA to E. coli with near unit efficiency. The packaging reaction can generate 10(5) clones with high molecular weight DNA inserts per microgram of vector DNA. Using NotI fragments from E. coli DNA, it was shown that the system can clone 95- and 100-kbp fragments but not a 106-kbp fragment. Presumably, the combined size of the latter fragment and the vector DNA (13 kbp) exceeds the headful capacity of P1.\r"

Although the streptavidin gene is extremely lethal to the host cells, because of the strong biotin binding of the gene product, the gene was expressed efficiently in E. coli by using T7 RNA polymerase/T7 promoter expression systems. The expressed streptavidin accumulated to more than 35% of the total cell protein. The expressed streptavidin was insoluble in the cell. However, after solubilization by dialysis against 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 1.5) and removal of guanidine hydrochloride by dialysis, the protein became soluble and renatured. This simple procedure yielded streptavidin purified almost to homogeneity. The purified streptavidin bound 3.5-3.9 molecules of biotin per molecule, indicating that it had almost full biotin-binding ability. Some of the purified streptavidin molecules aggregated into oligomers, suggesting that the C-terminal region of the molecule, present in our material but absent in typical preparations, may be responsible for the aggregation.\r"

Provirus insertion in these loci is responsible for the activation of adjacent genes. To determine whether Myc expression was also affected by these provirus insertions, we constructed T-cell hybrids between two rat thymic lymphomas containing a provirus in Mlvi-4 or Mlvi-1 and the murine T-cell lymphoma line BW5147. These hybrids segregated the provirus-containing rearranged alleles from the normal nonrearranged alleles of Mlvi-4 and Mlvi-1, and they carried an intact copy of rat Myc. Using an S1 nuclease protection assay, we observed that the expression of the rat Myc cosegregated with the rearranged Mlvi-4 or Mlvi-1 locus. However, provirus insertion in these loci had no effect on promoter utilization or on the expression of the murine Myc locus. We conclude that provirus insertion exerts a long-range cis effect on the expression of Myc. Therefore, provirus integration in a single locus may affect the expression of multiple genes, some of which may be located a long distance from the site of integration.\r"

We sequenced selected restriction fragments of a Syrian hamster CAD cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence agreed with the sequence of tryptic peptides and the amino acid composition of the DHOase domain isolated by controlled proteolysis of CAD. Escherichia coli transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing the cDNA segment 5' to the aspartate transcarbamoylase coding region expressed a polypeptide recognized by DHOase domain-specific antibodies. Thus, the order of domains within the polypeptide is NH2-carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase-DHO-aspartate transcarbamoylase-COOH. The 334-residue DHOase domain has a molecular weight of 36,733 and a pI of 6.1. A fragment of CAD having DHOase activity that was isolated after trypsin digestion has extensions on both the NH2 (18 residues) and COOH (47-65 residues) termini of this core domain. Three of five conserved histidines are within short, highly conserved regions that may participate in zinc binding. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the monofunctional and fused DHOases separately. Although these families may have arisen by convergent evolution, we favor a model involving DHOase gene duplication and insertion into an ancestral bifunctional locus.\r"

These fern species have therefore been generally considered to be of polyploid origin. Enzyme electrophoretic investigations have demonstrated, however, that within fern genera, species having the lowest chromosome numbers (n = 27-52) have the number of isozymes typical of diploid seed plants; there is no isozyme evidence for polyploidy of these plants. We have constructed a genomic DNA library from Polystichum munitum (n = 41), a homosporous fern, and have screened the library for sequences homologous to the chlorophyll a/b-binding (CAB) protein genes of higher plants. The majority of the sequences isolated and characterized by nucleotide sequence determination represent defective CAB genes. This result is in contrast to the situation in the genomes of diploid angiosperms, where most, and sometimes all, copies of the CAB gene family represent functional members. Several hypotheses could explain the existence of multiple defective CAB genes in P. munitum. (i) The defective CAB genes are the result of \"gene silencing\" following polyploidy. (ii) P. munitum has not gone through a polyploidization event, but several, and perhaps the majority, of its CAB genes have mutated to a nonfunctional state (a phenomenon not yet observed in any of the genomes of non-fern plants so far examined). (iii) Some defective CAB genes have been specifically amplified in the genome of P. munitum.\r"

In this paper we describe the formation of joint molecules in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, using adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (ATP[gamma S]) as nucleotide cofactor. Upon the addition of double-stranded DNA, the ATP[gamma S]-RecA protein-single-stranded DNA presynaptic complexes can form homologously paired molecules that are stable after deproteinization. Formation of these joint molecules requires both homology and a free homologous end, suggesting that they are plectonemic in nature. This reaction is very sensitive to magnesium ion concentration, with a maximum rate and extent observed at 4-5 mM magnesium acetate. Under these conditions, the average length of heteroduplex DNA within the joint molecules is 2.4-3.4 kilobase pairs. Thus, RecA protein can form extensive regions of heteroduplex DNA in the presence of ATP[gamma S], suggesting that homologous pairing and the exchange of the DNA molecules can occur without ATP hydrolysis. A model for the RecA protein-catalyzed DNA-strand-exchange reaction that incorporates these results and its relevance to the mechanisms of eukaryotic recombinases are presented.\r"

Among them, gamma-preprotachykinin-(72-92)-peptide amide [gamma-PPT-(72-92)-NH2], a peptide derived by posttranslational processing of gamma-preprotachykinin, is most prominent. We report here that this peptide most likely acts on neurokinin-2 receptor sites since neurokinin A (a putative neurokinin-2 agonist) and gamma-PPT-(72-92)-NH2 are potent competitors of 125I-labeled gamma-PPT-(72-92)-NH2 binding whereas selective neurokinin-1 and -3 agonists are not. Moreover, the distribution of 125I-labeled gamma-PPT-(72-92)-NH2 and 125I-labeled neurokinin A binding sites are very similar in rat brain. On the other hand, 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-substance P (a neurokinin-1 ligand) and 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-eledoisin (a neurokinin-3 ligand) binding sites are differentially located in this tissue. Thus, it appears that gamma-PPT-(72-92)-NH2 binds to neurokinin-2 receptors and should be considered as a putative endogenous ligand for this receptor class.\r"

Here we report the isolation and characterization of the corresponding mouse gene designated GLUT4. The GLUT4 gene spans 7 kilobases and consists of 11 exons and 10 introns. The start site of transcription was mapped 180 nucleotides upstream of the initial methionine codon. The GLUT4 promoter contains four potential binding sites for the nuclear transcription factor Sp1 as well as a CCAAT box. DNase I footprinting of the GLUT4 promoter with nuclear extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells revealed that a differentiation-specific nuclear factor binds in the region at position -258 relative to the start site of transcription. Purified CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) was found to bind at the same position. Transient cotransfection into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes of a GLUT4 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene construct that contains the C/EBP binding site, together with a C/EBP expression vector, revealed that C/EBP trans-activates the GLUT4 promoter. We suggest that C/EBP plays an important role in tissue-specific, as well as metabolic, regulation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter gene.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the control of proliferation and growth-related gene expression in primary cultures of epithelial cells derived from rat lung. Type 2 epithelial cells line the gas-exchange surface of the alveoli where they produce and secrete surfactant. When isolated from adult animals, type 2 cells do not proliferate in culture, although they have a limited ability to do so in vivo. We show that type 2 cells isolated from neonatal rats proliferate in culture and that growth can be reversibly arrested by withdrawing serum from the medium. We studied the expression of five genes whose mRNA levels fluctuate with the state of proliferation in several cell systems: the c-myc and c-Ha-ras protooncogenes and the genes encoding actin, ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17), and histone 3.2. All five mRNAs were constitutively expressed at identical levels in proliferating and nonproliferating (serum deprived) neonatal cells and in adult cells. Thus, at the level of mRNA abundance, the expression of these five genes was uncoupled from the growth state of the cells. By contrast, synthesis of the replication-dependent histones and the activity of ornithine decarboxylase were detectable only in proliferating neonatal cells and not in serum-deprived neonatal cells or in adult cells. The results suggest that, in type 2 cells, growth factors might regulate the translation, rather than the mRNA abundance, of at least some growth-related genes and that the ability to respond to this translational control may be developmentally regulated.\r"

  ".U": "90115872\r", 
  ".W": "The antagonist effect of (+/-)-3-amino-1-hydroxypyrrolid-2-one (HA-966) at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor occurs through a selective interaction with the glycine modulatory site within the receptor complex. When the enantiomers of (+/-)-HA-966 were resolved, the (R)-(+)-enantiomer was found to be a selective glycine/NMDA receptor antagonist, a property that accounts for its anticonvulsant activity in vivo. In contrast, the (S)-(-)-enantiomer was only weakly active as an NMDA-receptor antagonist, but nevertheless it possessed a marked sedative and muscle relaxant action in vivo. In radioligand binding experiments, (+)-HA-966 inhibited strychnine-insensitive [3H]glycine binding to rat cerebral cortex synaptic membranes with an IC50 of 12.5 microM, whereas (-)-HA-966 had an IC50 value of 339 microM. In electrophysiological experiments, (+)-HA-966 selectively antagonized NMDA receptor responses in rat cortical slices, whereas the (-)-enantiomer was much weaker. On cultured cortical neurones (+)-HA-966 inhibited glycine-potentiated NMDA responses with an IC50 = 13 microM compared with (-)-HA-966, which has an IC50 = 708 microM. In agreement with findings with racemic HA-966, even high concentrations of (+)-HA-966 did not completely inhibit NMDA responses, suggesting that (+)-HA-966 is a low-efficacy partial agonist. (+)-HA-966 produced parallel shifts to the right of the glycine concentration curve for potentiation of NMDA responses, resulting in an estimated pKb = 5.6. In mice, (+)-HA-966 antagonized sound and N-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (NMDLA)-induced seizures with ED50 values of 52.6 mg/kg of body weight (i.p.) and 900 mg/kg (i.v.), respectively. The coadministration of D-serine dose-dependently (10-100 micrograms into the cerebral ventricles per mouse) antagonized the anticonvulsant effect of a submaximal dose of (+)-HA-966 (100 micrograms administered directly into the cerebral ventricles) against NMDLA-induced seizures. The sedative/ataxic effect of racemic HA-966 was mainly attributable to the (-)-enantiomer, which was greater than 25-fold more potent than the (+)-enantiomer. It is suggested that, as in the case of the sedative gamma-butyrolactone, disruption of striatal dopaminergic mechanisms may be responsible for this action.\r"

Transcriptional mapping indicated that the gene for v-ubi was transcribed during the late phase of viral infection. Two transcriptional start sites potentially encoding v-ubi were identified. Both sites were contained within a sequence motif common to baculovirus late genes. A recombinant virus, AcUbi-beta Gal, encoding a ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase fusion protein was constructed to monitor the temporal regulation of v-ubi gene during viral infection. The fusion protein was expressed maximally at 14-18 hr postinfection, consistent with its classification as a late protein. The amount of ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase fusion protein that accumulated in AcUbi-beta Gal-infected cells by 48 hr postinfection was approximately 14% of the level of beta-galactosidase that was synthesized under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Transcriptional analysis confirmed that synthesis of the fusion protein was directed by the v-ubi gene promoter. AcUbi-beta Gal also produced normal levels of authentic viral ubiquitin message. Southern blot analysis of AcUbi-beta Gal and 15 additional isolates revealed that the fusion sequences had not recombined at the ubiquitin locus. A polyubiquitin gene was isolated and sequenced from Spodoptera frugiperda, a lepidopteran host cell line for AcMNPV. The predicted amino acid sequence of the product of the host gene is identical to animal ubiquitin.\r"

  ".W": "The CheY protein is phosphorylated by CheA and dephosphorylated by CheZ as part of the chemotactic signal transduction pathway in Escherichia coli. Phosphorylation of CheY has been proposed to occur on an aspartate residue. Each of the eight aspartate residues of CheY was replaced by using site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions at Asp-12, Asp-13, or Asp-57 resulted in loss of chemotaxis. Most of the mutant CheY proteins were still phosphorylated by CheA but exhibited modified biochemical properties, including reduced ability to accept phosphate from CheA, altered phosphate group stability, and/or resistance to CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation. The properties of CheY proteins bearing a substitution at position 57 were most aberrant, consistent with the hypothesis that Asp-57 is the normal site of acyl phosphate formation. Evidence for an alternate site of phosphorylation in the Asp-57 mutants is presented. Phosphorylated CheY is believed to cause tumbling behavior. However, a dominant mutant CheY protein that was not phosphorylated in vitro caused tumbling in vivo in the absence of CheA. This phenotype suggests that the role of phosphorylation in the wild-type CheY protein is to stabilize a transient conformational change that can generate tumbling behavior.\r"

In striking contrast, replacement of His-94 with Arg causes a complete loss of sugar binding and transport, although the cells contain a normal complement of permease molecules. Thus, as shown previously with lac permease, only a single His residue is important for activity, but, in the case of mel permease, the critical His residue is present in the 3rd putative transmembrane helix rather than the 10th.\r"

  ".U": "90115901\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are cells generated from tumor suspensions cultured in interleukin 2 that can mediate cancer regression when adoptively transferred into mice or humans. Since TILs proliferate rapidly in vitro, recirculate, and preferentially localize at the tumor site in vivo, they provide an attractive model for delivery of exogenous genetic material into man. To determine whether efficient gene transfer into TILs is feasible, we transduced human TILs with the bacterial gene for neomycin-resistance (NeoR) using the retroviral vector N2. The transduced TIL populations were stable and polyclonal with respect to the intact NeoR gene integration and expressed high levels of neomycin phosphotransferase activity. The NeoR gene insertion did not alter the in vitro growth pattern and interleukin 2 dependence of the transduced TILs. Analyses of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement for beta- and gamma-chain genes revealed the oligoclonal nature of the TIL populations with no major change in the DNA rearrangement patterns or the levels of mRNA expression of the beta and gamma chains following transduction and selection of TILs in the neomycin analog G418. Human TILs expressed mRNA for tumor necrosis factors (alpha and beta) and interleukin 2 receptor P55 but not for interleukin 1 beta, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 6, and interferon gamma when grown with high-dose interleukin 2 without subsequent activation with mitogen or specific antigen. This pattern of cytokine-mRNA expression was not significantly altered following the transduction of TILs. The NeoR gene-transduced TILs could thus be used to follow the trafficking and survival of TILs in vivo, and clinical protocols using these transduced TILs in cancer patients have begun. The studies demonstrate the feasibility of TILs as suitable cellular vehicles for the introduction of therapeutic genes into patients receiving autologous TILs.\r"

Including three previously unreported examples described here, we have identified 13 different point substitutions in alloalbumins of Japanese origin. Of these only albumin B and two proalbumins have been reported in other ethnic groups, and these are the most common variants of European origin. Some alloalbumins of Asiatic origin, but not yet identified in Japanese, are present in diverse ethnic groups. An alloalbumin found in indigenes of New Guinea (lysine----asparagine at position 313) is also present in Caucasians of various European descents. Albumin Lambadi, occurring in a tribal group in south India, has a mutation (glutamic acid----lysine at position 501) also found as a rare variant in individuals of diverse ethnic origin resident on four continents. These results suggest that some alloalbumins with the same substitution may have originated by independent mutations in various populations. This, together with the apparent clustering of point substitutions in the protein structure, may reflect hypermutability of the albumin gene.\r"

Our strategy has been to characterize naturally occurring mutants from tumor cells to pinpoint potential domains of RB protein crucial for tumor suppression. We show here that osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 contains an abnormal endogenous RB protein of 95 kDa (p95) that is located mainly in the cytoplasm. This protein was identified by antibodies recognizing several different RB epitopes, but not by one directed solely against the C terminus, suggesting C-terminal truncation. This conclusion was supported by analysis of mRNA and genomic DNA, which revealed that a transcriptionally active RB allele had a deletion of exons 21-27. In contrast to normal RB protein, this truncated protein was not phosphorylated and did not bind to the large tumor (T) antigen encoded by simian virus 40. We previously reported that introduction of normal RB protein into Saos-2 cells suppressed their neoplastic phenotype, indicating functional inactivation of their endogenous RB genes. These results provide an initial step to elucidate domains crucial to the cancer-suppression function of RB protein; its C-terminal portion is evidently important for this activity.\r"

In addition, chloroplast expression vectors containing replicon fragments from pea, tobacco, or maize chloroplast DNA have also been tested for efficiency and duration of cat expression in chloroplasts of tobacco cells. Cultured NT1 tobacco cells collected on filter papers were bombarded with tungsten particles coated with pUC118 (negative control), 35S-CAT (nuclear expression vector), pHD312 (repliconless chloroplast expression vector), and pHD407, pACp18, and pACp19 (chloroplast expression vectors with replicon). Sonic extracts of cells bombarded with pUC118 showed no detectable cat activity in the autoradiograms. Nuclear expression of cat reached two-thirds of the maximal 48 hr after bombardment and the maximal at 72 hr. Cells bombarded with chloroplast expression vectors showed a low level of expression until 48 hr of incubation. A dramatic increase in the expression of cat was observed 24 hr after the addition of fresh medium to cultured cells in samples bombarded with pHD407; the repliconless vector pHD312 showed about 50% of this maximal activity. The expression of nuclear cat and the repliconless chloroplast vector decreased after 72 hr, but a high level of chloroplast cat expression was maintained in cells bombarded with pHD407. Organelle-specific expression of cat in appropriate compartments was checked by introducing various plasmid constructions into tobacco protoplasts by electroporation. Although the nuclear expression vector 35S-CAT showed expression of cat, no activity was observed with any chloroplast vectors.\r"

By using radiolabeled GM-CSF with high specific activity, we have investigated the factors and mechanisms that regulate GM-CSF receptor expression in normal human neutrophils, monocytes, and partially purified bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells. The neutrophil GM-CSF receptor was found to rapidly internalize in the presence of ligand through a mechanism that required endocytosis. Out of a large panel of naturally occurring humoral factors tested, only GM-CSF itself, tumor necrosis factor, and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe were found to down-regulate neutrophil GM-CSF receptor expression after a 2-hr exposure at biologically active concentrations (95% +/- 1%, 34% +/- 5%, 48% +/- 8% receptor down-regulation, respectively). GM-CSF also down-regulated its own receptor on monocytes and myeloid progenitor cells. Since formyl-Met-Leu-Phe is known to stimulate neutrophil protein kinase C activity, we also tested the ability of protein kinase C agonists to modulate GM-CSF receptor expression. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, bryostatin-1, and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol were found to induce rapid down-regulation of the GM-CSF receptor in neutrophils, monocytes, and partially purified myeloid progenitor cells, suggesting that this effect may be at least partially mediated by protein kinase C. These data suggest that certain activators of neutrophil function may negatively regulate their biological effects by inducing down-regulation of the GM-CSF receptor.\r"

Few general statements can be made concerning the regulation of ion conductance through the various classes of channel, or through one particular species of channel that is expressed in and subject to regulation in different cell types. Rather, it seems that many different patterns of modulation can occur in different cells, and so, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that determine these diverse patterns represents a major challenge. To summarize, we will focus on three aspects of the modulatory action of PKC.\r"

With endovaginal sonography, the gestational sac may be seen within the decidua at about 4.5 weeks menstrual age. The yolk sac is the first structure to be seen within the gestational sac, and confirms the presence of a gestational sac rather than a decidual cast. The embryo is identified by endovaginal sonography early in the 6th week, and cardiac activity is routinely identified by a crown-rump length of 3 to 5 mm. On endovaginal sonography, absent cardiac activity in an embryo having a crown-rump length of greater than 3 to 5 mm indicates embryonic death. With endovaginal scanning, a gestational sac of greater than 8 mm without a yolk sac, or greater than 16 mm without an embryo, also indicates a nonviable pregnancy. Routine sonography primarily to assess the menstrual age should be performed in the second trimester, when added clinically relevant information may be obtained.

Spectral analysis and its utility in Doppler signal analysis are described. The various options available on modern Doppler US instrumentation are reviewed, including duplex Doppler techniques and color Doppler flow mapping. Finally, the authors discuss artifacts and pitfalls likely to be encountered in the routine clinical use of Doppler US for diagnostic purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Duplex and color Doppler ultrasound (US) are noninvasive techniques capable of providing much information about the condition of blood vessels and flow within them throughout the body. Doppler US provides more than noninvasive angiography. Besides assessment of blood vessel patency and direction of flow, analysis of the flow velocity waveform allows quantitation of arterial stenoses and evaluation of both physiologic and pathologic changes in impedance. In certain situations, Doppler US can aid in tissue characterization and estimation of absolute flow volume. Color Doppler flow imaging may both expedite and clarify the duplex Doppler examination. In addition, color Doppler imaging can demonstrate flow orientation and improve the identification of turbulence and soft plaque. Color and duplex Doppler US are complementary, with color Doppler techniques providing spatial orientation and pulse Doppler techniques providing the time-velocity spectrum for quantitation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the value of ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, and spot radiography in the detection, counting, and measurement of gallstone fragments during lithotripsy, in vitro visibility studies were conducted on fragments from 20 stones. Fluoroscopic visibility was evaluated during and after lithotripsy on 185 fragments placed in an anthropomorphic phantom. Three US experiments were performed on the fragments to study the visibility of fragments as a function of size, the accuracy of the count with large numbers of fragments, and the ability of observers to detect and count fragments larger than both 4 mm and 5 mm. With fluoroscopy, fragment detection rates ranged from 20% (fragments larger than 2.5 mm) to 80% (fragments larger than 4.5 mm). With US, all fragments larger than 1.5 mm were detected, and US was significantly better than fluoroscopy and spot radiography for detection of fragments 2.5 mm or smaller. US was also more accurate than fluoroscopy (11% vs 59% error) in the assessment of the number of fragments. When fragments larger than 4 mm or 5 mm were being counted with US, 92% of the fragments were visualized. The results suggest that US is more accurate for monitoring gallstone lithotripsy than fluoroscopy or spot radiography.\r"

A tubal ring (a 1-3-cm mass consisting of a 2-4-mm concentric, echogenic rim of tissue surrounding a hypoechoic center) was seen in 23 of 34 (68%) ectopic pregnancies in which the fallopian tube had not ruptured, and the tubal ring could be distinguished from a corpus luteum cyst in most cases. Transvaginal sonography also depicted simple (n = 22) or particulate (bloody) (n = 13) peritoneal fluid associated with ectopic pregnancy. In each case in the series, at least one abnormal uterine, adnexal, or peritoneal finding was detected at transvaginal sonography. Because of its improved resolution of uterine and adnexal structures, transvaginal sonography is recommended as a means for detailed evaluation of patients suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy.\r"

On CT scans, a soft-tissue mass was identified in the round window niche in both cases. Widening of the basilar turn of the cochlea and characteristic erosion of the promontory were noticed in one case. Preoperative MR imaging (performed in only one case) revealed a soft-tissue mass in the labyrnth, extending into the round window niche. Findings at CT and MR imaging are discussed, and a differential diagnosis is given. The literature is reviewed. The authors' findings suggest that CT and MR imaging may prove very valuable in the previously difficult preoperative diagnosis of these tumors. In the setting of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, atypical Meniere disease, or recurrent vertigo, the presence of a mass in the labyrinth or labyrinthine windows- delineated on CT or MR images, despite a normal internal auditory canal, cerebellopontine angle, or brain stem - is highly suggestive of intralabyrinthine schwannoma.\r"

The major criterion for diagnosing a diameter narrowing of more than 50% was a velocity of greater than 100 cm/sec. Angiography demonstrated 10 stenoses and one occlusion in main or accessory renal arteries in seven patients. Twenty-two percent of kidneys had accessory renal arteries. Color duplex scanning helped identify 58% of the main arteries and no accessory vessels. None of the stenotic vessels were identified with duplex scanning, but the single occluded vessel was correctly diagnosed. Nine of the 29 vessels identified with duplex scanning were incorrectly diagnosed as stenotic, findings yielding a specificity of 37%. The authors conclude that the published velocity threshold of 100 cm/sec is too low. Duplex scanning with current technology is unlikely to prove satisfactory for screening patients with hypertension for renal artery stenosis.\r"

  ".U": "90116388\r", 
  ".W": "Current noninvasive imaging techniques for diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of extremities are limited in their ability to demonstrate central vein involvement and to distinguish acute from chronic changes. The utility of spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for DVT was evaluated in 100 patients suspected of having either upper- (n = 25) or lower-extremity (n = 75) DVT. Ninety-seven patients were imaged successfully. In a subset of 36 patients, prospective comparison of MR imaging with contrast venography revealed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, and Kappa level of agreement of .752 (P less than .0001). MR imaging showed more central extent of thrombus than did venography in all five patients with upper-extremity DVT and in 13 of 25 patients (52%) with lower-extremity DVT. Although all patients in the study were evaluated for acute symptoms, 13 of 59 (22%) MR imaging studies positive for DVT demonstrated chronic disease. MR images demonstrated ancillary abnormalities in 18 of 41 (44%) patients who did not have DVT. Thus, MR imaging has a role as the definitive examination when the results of initial screening studies are unsatisfactory, or as a first-line examination if (a) there is suspicion of upper-extremity or pelvic vein thrombosis, (b) there is a history of prior DVT that necessitates distinction of acute from chronic changes, or (c) other tests are unavailable.\r"

The prevalence of DVT in symptomatic legs is 40%, a value at which venography followed by Doppler ultrasound (in cases of nondiagnostic or unsuccessful venography) is preferred over the sequence of Doppler-plethysmography, provided that the sensitivity of the latter is less than 94%. If the prevalence of DVT decreases to 25% or the sensitivity of Doppler is 95% or higher, then the sequences of Doppler-plethysmography and venography-Doppler are equivalent in helping minimize resulting morbidity and mortality. Because of the greater clinical significance of proximal DVT, the analysis was modified to reflect changes in prevalence, sensitivity of noninvasive tests, and rate of pulmonary embolus due to DVT extending above the knee. In this case, performing plethysmography is slightly better than performing venography followed by Doppler or plethysmography.\r"

In five patients, the pulmonary calcifications partially decreased or disappeared, and the prognosis did not seem to be altered. In one patient, the pulmonary calcifications were associated with cardiac calcifications leading to death. The mechanism of these pulmonary calcifications is thought to be predominantly or exclusively metastatic and partially iatrogenic. Data indicated two major causative factors: therapy with massive doses of calcium and postsurgical acute renal failure. Radiographic findings of persistent alveolar lesions of increasing density in patients undergoing antibiotic therapy after open heart surgery are suggestive of the diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary calcifications. Scintigraphy with bone agents or computed tomography is recommended for early confirmation and prevention of therapeutic errors, especially after cardiac transplantation.\r"

Ninety-two examinations were performed less than 72 hours after injury; 31 of these were done at 0-24 hours. For the diagnosis of hip fracture in an individual patient, the overall sensitivity was 0.933; specificity, 0.950; positive predictive value, 0.918; and negative predictive value, 0.960. For the clinically important subgroup of 145 patients with normal or equivocal radiographs, the sensitivity was 0.978. A characteristic pattern for greater trochanter fractures was found. Other diagnoses were scintigraphically established in 41% of patients evaluated. The data suggest that patients of all ages, regardless of the time after injury, can be imaged as soon as they present.\r"

These coded findings and interpretations are then stored in a clinical data base. The system recognizes both radiologic findings and diagnostic interpretations.

The most common preoperative diagnoses are acute appendicitis and appendiceal abscess. A review of the literature is presented along with our experience in three additional cases of Crohn's disease limited to the appendix. We suggest that Crohn's disease be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis and that extensive intraoperative examination of the gastrointestinal tract be made in any case of suspected appendicitis that has had a protracted preoperative course.\r"
