  ".W": "Fourteen patients with either acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris were transported by helicopter air ambulance to North Carolina Baptist Hospital during a 1-month period. Six patients had preflight and inflight plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels determined. All 14 patients were monitored for ventricular arrhythmias. The mean inflight plasma epinephrine level was significantly higher than the mean preflight level (3455 v 841 pg/mL, P less than .005). There was also a trend toward higher inflight norepinephrine levels; however, this increase was not statistically significant. No patient had a monitored ventricular arrhythmia. These findings suggest that helicopter transport of cardiac patients may be associated with significant patient stress, as reflected by high inflight catecholamine levels. Further study with a larger population of patients is needed to determine whether or not an increased incidence of inflight ventricular arrhythmias is associated with these catecholamine changes.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty four patients who presented to the emergency department following severe acute tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose (defined as an antidepressant ingestion associated with a QRS interval greater than or equal to 0.10 seconds, TCA level greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL, or grade IV coma) were prospectively evaluated to determine the incidence of hypotension and the factors associated with its development. Among these patients, the mean antidepressant level was 1,094 ng/mL. The overall frequency of admission hypotension (systolic BP less than 95 mmHg) was 34% (22 of 64 patients). Using regression analysis, systolic BP showed poor correlation with TCA level (r = -.37) and maximal QRS interval (r = -.17) following severe TCA overdose. Using multivariate analysis with a logistic regression model, the influence of BP (as well as TCA level, QRS interval, and coingestion of another drug) was evaluated on four clinical outcomes: seizures, arrhythmias, aspiration pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The occurrence of arrhythmias and pulmonary edema was significantly associated (inversely) with hypotension (P less than .01). Seizures and aspiration pneumonia were unrelated to admission BP. These results suggest that hypotension is common after severe TCA overdose and occurs independently of TCA level and prolongation of the QRS interval. Hypotension is strongly associated with the development of arrhythmias and pulmonary edema. Seizures and aspiration pneumonia may occur regardless of initial BP.\r"

  ".W": "Prehospital patient management decisions are complex because the traumatized patient population is heterogeneous with respect to demographics, mechanism of injury, physiological response to injury, and time from injury to medical care. One hundred and nine blunt trauma patient evaluations by paramedics in a county-wide semirural emergency medical services (EMS) system were analyzed to determine paramedic time on the scene and the factors that might influence onscene time. Onscene time linearly correlated with a prolonged transport time. Hemodynamic and respiratory dysfunction were also associated with increased onscene time. Mean onscene time was not significantly different between high (greater than 13) and low (less than or equal to 13) trauma score (TS) groups, although patients with low TS did receive more interventions (more intravenous lines, more frequent intubation, and more frequent pneumatic antishock garment use). Similar results were found when high (greater than 10) and low (less than or equal to 10) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) groups were compared. The correlation of emergency department TS with initial prehospital TS and onscene time demonstrated a small improvement in TS with increasing onscene time for the patient with an initial TS greater than or equal to 13. However, patient groups with either a low TS or a low GCS score showed no significant improvement in TS with increasing onscene time. Without a strict management algorithm, paramedics use a variety of cues to guide their actions during the onscene management of blunt trauma. Future studies should address the impact of strict management algorithms on onscene time and ultimate patient outcome.\r"

A combined air and ground critical care transport service provided the opportunity for a direct comparison of patients with acute cardiac conditions (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) transported either by our helicopter or by a specially equipped critical care ground vehicle. Both air and ground components were similarly equipped in terms of personnel and medical equipment. Seventy-eight (27 ground, 51 air) transport cases were studied. Both patient groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, Killip classification, and diagnosis. Serious untoward events, defined as arrhythmias, chest pain, hypotension, bradycardia, seizures, and cardiac arrest, occurred in 41% of air transports and 7.5% of ground transports (P less than .002). The overall incidence of untoward events was also significantly greater with air transports (25/51, or 49%) than with the ground vehicle (4/27, or 15%; P less than .005). The reasons for these differences are unknown.\r"

These hemodynamic responses are produced at lower dosages when ME is injected into the vertebral artery, but not the carotid artery, suggesting that ME receptors are localized in the vertebrobasilar artery circulation. The area postrema (AP), a circumventricular organ devoid of a functional blood-brain barrier, represents a likely site for these receptors. We have tested the effects of chronic AP ablation upon hemodynamic responses to ME in conscious dogs. In three dogs with subtotal AP destruction, ME responses were preserved. However, in another dog with complete ablation of both the AP and the area subpostrema, ME responses were eliminated. These results indicate that total destruction of the AP, and perhaps of deeper structures as well, is necessary to abolish hemodynamic responses to ME.\r"

Doppler-echocardiography was used to asses the influences of blood pressure (BP) on LV filling in 43 normotensive volunteers aged 12 +/- 0.98 years with heart rates less than or equal to 90 beats/min. Doppler peak diastolic transmitral flow velocities, diastolic flow integrals, and early diastolic deceleration were measured. An interesting difference was noted between the influence of systolic and diastolic BP. Systolic BP was related to LV mass (r = 0.43; P less than 0.005), but was unrelated to any of the Doppler filling indices. Diastolic BP was unrelated to LV mass, but was inversely related to peak early diastolic flow velocity (r = -0.37; P less than 0.05), early diastolic flow velocity integral (r = -0.34; P less than 0.05). The ratio of late-to-early filling (A/E) was directly related to diastolic BP (r = 0.42; P less than 0.005). The relationship between A/E and diastolic BP was strong in subjects (n = 21) with bimodal P waves in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead V1 (r = 0.61; P less than 0.005), but absent in those (n = 15) with unimodal P waves (r = 0.18; P = NS). Thus, the pattern of LV filling is related to the level of diastolic BP in normal adolescents, especially in those with bimodal P waves on ECG. These diastolic BP related changes are independent of heart rate and LV hypertrophy and may represent very early pre-hypertensive alterations in LV diastolic function.\r"

The changes in AC and BFV were negatively and significantly correlated both between T0 and T1 and between T1 and T2.

An adequate blood supply to exercising muscles at the onset of contraction seems to be an important factor controlling the extent of pressor response to isometric contraction. In comparison to normotensive subjects without familiar hypertensive history (F-), normotensive subjects with family history of hypertension (F+) have a reduced peripheral vasodilator capacity which impairs the possibility to adjust the muscular blood flow during exercise. An enhanced pressor response to handgrip test was observed in F+ and this hyperresponsivity was inversely related to the extent of forearm vasodilation capacity and largely prevented by the pretest increase of blood flow in exercising muscles. Our results suggest the importance of local vasodilating capacity as a determinant of reflex pressor response to isometric exercise.\r"

In patients with sustained hypertension, baseline vascular resistance was significantly higher than in normotensive controls, and it was strongly correlated with its change following orthostasis. In patients with borderline hypertension, baseline vascular resistance was similar to that of normotensive controls and did not correlate with its change following orthostasis.

Mean right atrial pressure was equivalent in groups II and III and significantly higher in the last group than in group I. An increased pulmonary arterial resistance (PAR) in group II and, to a large extent, in group III accounted for the elevation of diastolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressure in both groups in comparison with group I. Cardiac index (CI) was lower and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) higher in group III than in group I. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) values were within the normal range and equivalent between groups II and III, and both significantly higher than in group I. PAR showed a positive relation with SVR (r = 0.30, P less than 0.01) and an inverse relation with CI (r = -0.561, P less than 0.001). Findings indicate that in systemic hypertension with LV hypertrophy there is an elevation of the right ventricular filling pressure and the pulmonary arterial pressure whose degree is even higher in severe hypertension. This increase is not necessarily a consequence of impairment of LV function as suggested by the normal range of PCWP values.\r"

Using the 24-hour urinary excretions of albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as markers, we examined the relationship between office and ABP and target-organ changes in the kidney in 42 untreated patients with essential hypertension. Mean urinary albumin excretion was 23.2 +/- 34.3 mg/day and mean urinary NAG excretion was 45.1 +/- 22.9 nmol/hr/mg creatinine. Urinary albumin excretion was positively correlated with both office and mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure (r = 0.31, P less than 0.05; and r = 0.44, P less than 0.01, respectively). Urinary NAG excretion was positively correlated with 24-hour ambulatory systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (r = 0.32, P less than 0.05; r = 0.32, P less than 0.05; and r = 0.39, P less than 0.05, respectively), but not with office blood pressure. Thus, urinary albumin and NAG excretions are positively correlated with blood pressure and may be useful markers of renal involvement in patients with essential hypertension. Additionally, ABP may be more reliable than office blood pressure in identifying those patients at risk for hypertensive target-organ changes in the kidney.\r"

Simultaneous measurements were made (in 24 volunteers, by 4 trained observers) using a Y connector so that the Accutracker and a mercury sphygmomanometer were in parallel. Average blood pressure by direct auscultation (215 readings) was 129.1 +/- 12.0/77.8 +/- 14.4, and by Accutracker was 130.9 +/- 13.0/75.9 +/- 14.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). The Accutracker overestimated systolic blood pressure by 1.7 +/- 5.8 and underestimated diastolic blood pressure by 1.9 +/- 7.6 mm Hg. The average difference between pairs of readings was 5.0 mm Hg for systolic and 5.5 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. These data indicate that the concordance of blood pressure readings recorded by Accutracker and direct auscultation is sufficient to justify its use in noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.\r"

After a period of control measurements, bilateral renal artery constriction (2K-2C) was produced in 5 dogs and monitoring continued for 3 weeks or more. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and LV end-systolic pressure (LVESP) was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in the 2K-2C dogs compared to controls. There was no significant difference in LV mass, W Ten, or dP/dt, although TPR was 65% higher in the 2K-2C dogs. Comparable data from five dogs with single kidney hypertension (1K-1C), after 3 weeks, showed an elevated MAP and LVESP similar to the 2K-2C dogs. This group also showed a significant increase in LV mass and dP/dt (P less than 0.01), while the TPR was significantly decreased. The data suggest that the mechanism of hypertension development in the 2K-2C dog is different from that of the 1K-1C dog, and that there is evidence of increase in neuroadrenergic activity (viz, myocardial contractility) associated with the development of LV hypertrophy. The role of W Ten in the hypertrophic process was less clear from these data. Further study of these models may provide insight into the relative roles of the neuroadrenergic and volume-vasoconstriction components in the pathogenesis of hypertension and changes in LV mass.\r"

One brand of commercial dolomite tablets were investigated for metallic contents such as aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), sclemium (Se), and zinc (Zn). Ten randomly selected tablets were weighted, dried, pulverized and low-temperature plasma ashed. An ash aliquot of each tablet was dissolved in 35% Ultrex nitric acid, and after dilution analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with an HGA-500 graphite furnace, As-1 autosampler, and PRS-10 printer sequencer. The results (presented as mean wt/g of powder +/- 95% confidence limits) are: Al 900 +/- 300 micrograms/g; As 1.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/g; Cd 0.16 +/- 0.04 micrograms/g; Cr 5.9 +/- 1.4 micrograms/g; Cu 3.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/g; Pb 1.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g; Mn 66 +/- 7.0 micrograms/g; Se 1.6 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g; and Zn 147 +/- 88 micrograms/g. These trace metals could pose health hazards to the public such as lead poisoning, dementia, and hypertension due to cadmium. Also, zinc can potentiate cadmium-hypertensive effects. The need exists to initiate some regulations to limit maximal content of trace metals in \"health food\" supplements to protect high-risk groups and that sector of the population who use megadoses of such products.\r"

Hence, in view of these premigration data supported by other evidence from the Kenyan Luo Migrant Study, it appears that the higher BP levels of the Luo migrants are not due to selective migration but are consequent upon environmental changes, including changes in electrolyte intake, which occur rapidly after migration.\r"

There were racial differences in dietary mineral intake with both white normotensives and hypertensives ingesting more potassium than their black counterparts and white normotensives consuming more calcium and magnesium than white hypertensives and both groups of blacks. White normotensives also used more high sodium chloride foods than did other groups.

Electric stimulation of the ADN elicited frequency-dependent depressor, bradycardic, and sympatho-inhibitory responses. Angiotensin II, administered ICV, dose-dependently attenuated these responses induced by ADN stimulation in normotensive rats. We found, however, these attenuations could be abolished by ICV pretreatment with A II analog. Vasopressin (ICV) did not change any responses to ADN stimulation. The vasopressor and sympatho-inhibitory responses to ADN stimulation were significantly less in SHRs when compared with those in WKYs: In SHRs, A II analog completely cancelled the A II-attenuated responses to ADN stimulation. These findings suggest that A II can centrally attenuate baroreflex, which might be independent from vasopressin, and in the brain A II can contribute to the central resetting of baroreflex in SHRs.\r"

In obese rats undergoing a supplemented fast, blood pressure fell almost immediately but then stabilized despite continuing weight loss. The depressor effect of fasting was reversed within 2 days of refeeding. Body weight change was no longer correlated with blood pressure change after nutritional state was controlled for. Nutritional state (fed, fasted, refed), but not body weight, has important effects on blood pressure.\r"

Oscillometric monitoring was compared to random-zero sphygmomanometry in 28 ambulatory subjects, using the instruments in a random order. The oscillometric monitor overestimated random-zero systolic pressure (mean difference = 5.7 mm Hg; P less than 0.001), but did not differ in diastolic pressure (difference = 1.3 mm Hg, P greater than 0.3). Correlation (r) between methods was 0.94 for systolic pressure and 0.83 for diastolic pressure. Repeatability of sequential measures did not differ between methods. To evaluate the oscillometric monitor in the intraoperative setting, it was used simultaneously with a radial artery catheter to measure blood pressure in 14 patients undergoing peripheral vascular or other major surgery. The oscillometric monitor underestimated intra-arterial systolic pressure (mean difference = -9.4 mm Hg; P less than 0.002), but overestimated intraarterial diastolic pressure (difference = 5.7 mm Hg; P less than 0.005). There was no difference in mean arterial pressure (P greater than 0.1). Correlation between methods was 0.88 for systolic, 0.71 for diastolic, and 0.79 for mean arterial pressure. The oscillometric instrument had a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 97% in detecting intraarterial systolic pressures of 160 mm Hg or greater, and a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 89% in detecting intraarterial systolic pressures of 100 mm Hg or less. These findings demonstrate differences between the oscillometric monitor and other standard methods of blood pressure measurement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly correlated with urinary excretion of the EDLS, age, and the obesity index. The plasma EDLS correlated with urinary EDLS. Urinary EDLS excretion well correlated with the inhibitory activity on Na+,K+-ATPase, and also with the urinary excretion of NaCl. Obesity index correlated with the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition and arterial pressure. Although plasma content of atrial natriuretic polypeptide correlated with the urinary Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition, it did not correlate with the rest of all parameters. Plasma vasopressin level did not correlate with these parameters either. These results clearly indicate that the circulating EDLS (ie, Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor) is implicated in the hypertension associated with an excess intake of sodium, aging and obesity.\r"

To overcome these problems we have developed a computer-assisted diary (CAD). The subject marks boxes on a computer-readable card to indicate the time, location, body position, activity, and mood associated with each blood pressure reading. Software implemented on a personal computer downloads the diary information from a card reader, checks its quality, scores the data, extracts quantitative critical features, and inserts the information into computer files ready for data analysis and clinical report writing. The diary system was tested on 24-hour blood pressure scans of 32 normotensive working adults. The results indicated that the automated diary system was accepted well and used accurately by the subjects. Activities and moods coded by the CAD system were systematically related to the level of systolic blood pressure. The method produced results that are similar to those of traditional diaries, with major time and cost savings resulting from computer automation. We have concluded that the computer-assisted diary is an effective way to monitor behavioral states during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring which merits further trial applications.\r"

Both patients had large tumors associated with markedly elevated levels of epinephrine. Although hypertension was adequately controlled in both patients with phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine (1 patient) and nitroprusside, both patients deteriorated rapidly. The first patient expired during attempts to identify a source of sepsis. None was found at autopsy. The second patient underwent urgent adrenalectomy which reversed the multiple organ system failure and resulted in patient survival. We conclude from review of these patients and three others in the literature that (a) crisis is an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma; (b) its manifestations include vascular lability, high fever, encephalopathy and multiple organ system failure; (c) it may be the result of increased epinephrine secretion; (d) successful treatment of pheochromocytoma crisis demands prompt diagnosis, vigorous medical therapy and emergent tumor removal if the patient continues to deteriorate.\r"

  ".W": "The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is better related to activity than resting systolic blood pressure (BP) in treated hypertensive patients. Many recommend ambulatory BP monitoring only during the day. However, 24-hour BP monitoring may be useful in treated patients to check adequate control of BP during the entire 24-hour period. We tested the influence of night BP on LVMI in treated versus nontreated patients. We compared two groups of hypertensive patients: A: 40 patients who had discontinued therapy at least 8 days prior to the study; B: 24 patients treated for more than 3 months with the same drugs (beta-blockers in 14 cases). Ambulatory BP was recorded every 30 minutes during night and every 15 minutes during day (Spacelabs 5200). The LVMI was calculated from M mode echo blind reading (Devereux's formula). Correlation coefficients between LVMI and casual, systolic BP were calculated for both day (7:00 AM to 10:59 PM) and night time (11:00 PM to 6:59 AM). Day systolic BP is better related to LVMI than casual and night systolic BP in group A. In contrast, a significantly higher correlation existed between night BP and LVMI in B, though average night BP level was lower. Conclusion: 24-hour BP monitoring may be useful in treated hypertensive patients. Inadequate lowering of night BP may partially account for persistent LVH in treated hypertensive patients.\r"

The black patient's SDBP did not decrease significantly (100.8 +/- 2.4 to 96.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg lowest) with enalapril but addition of hydrochlorothiazide achieved satisfactory SDBP control. It is concluded that hydrochlorothiazide should be added if greater than 10 mg/day of enalapril is needed in white patients and the initial therapy in black patients should be a combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide.\r"

Aortic depressor nerve (ADN) stimulation elicited frequency-dependent vasodepressor, bradycardiac, and sympatho-inhibitory responses in both DOCA-salt-treated and control rats. However, the responses to ADN stimulation were significantly smaller in DOCA-salt-treated rats. These findings suggest that baroreflex is attenuated centrally before the development of hypertension and this attenuation may contribute to the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension.\r"

The most commonly reported adverse experiences were dizziness, headache, asthenia, cold symptoms, and nasal congestion. Adverse effects and metabolic disorders often associated with diuretics and beta blockers such as sexual dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, or adverse lipid effects were seen infrequently during long-term treatment with terazosin as monotherapy. Overall, terazosin was shown to be effective, safe, and well tolerated by most patients.\r"

After 6 weeks of ketanserin (40 mg every 12 hours), blood pressures measured 12 hours after dosing were not significantly different from those obtained after placebo. However, 2 hours after ketanserin administration, supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures declined 11 +/- 10 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) and 6 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.005) from predose values, whereas placebo caused no change in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Except for a slight decline in serum prolactin levels 12 hours after dosing with ketanserin, no changes were observed in pituitary hormone levels, serum testosterone, plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, or lipoproteins. Stroke volume, measured 2 hours after dosing, increased with ketanserin therapy, but cardiac output, systemic resistance, and heart rate were unchanged. Ketanserin has a moderate antihypertensive effect and neutral metabolic-hormonal profile when used as monotherapy for the treatment of hypertension. However, further studies are needed to define the frequency of dosing that will provide 24 hours of antihypertensive activity.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental evidence that supports or rejects an involvement of opioid receptors in the cardiovascular effects of clonidine was sought. In anesthetized rabbits, clonidine decreased blood pressure and heart rate. These effects were related to the clonidine dose. High doses of clonidine produced a biphasic response in blood pressure without resulting in a significant baroreflex. However, it was not difficult to produce hypotensive action of clonidine without the biphasic action using low doses of clonidine. A pretreatment of the animals with naloxone (1 mg/1 kg) prevented the hypotensive action of clonidine at low dose. This antagonistic action of naloxone against clonidine was also evident in other cardiac parameters such as heart rate and efferent sympathetic renal nerve activity. The antagonistic action was not demonstrably significant with the high doses of clonidine. The present study in normotensive anesthetized rabbits suggests that specific central interactions between opioid and adrenergic receptors can be demonstrated under defined conditions, although such interactions were reported in pathophysiologic conditions such as essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Verapamil HCl was chronically administered to inbred Dahl S/JR and R/JR rats maintained on a diet containing 8.0% NaCl (w/w) and the effects on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were investigated. Treatment over a 4-week period via implanted miniosmotic pumps attenuated but did not prevent the development of salt-induced hypertension (HT) in the S/JR rat. Elevated HR, possibly reflexive in origin, was observed in S/JR rats that received verapamil but not in similarly treated R/JR rats. Although verapamil retarded the development of HT in S/JR rats, BP rose to moderately hypertensive levels, and the ventricle/body weight ratio was elevated by the termination of the study. The effect of verapamil on the density and affinity of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, and calcium channel receptors in renal and ventricular membranes was also assessed. The density of renal and ventricular alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors was not affected by chronic drug treatment. The density of renal alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors was greater in the S/JR strain than in the R/JR strain, regardless of the treatment. The density of muscarinic cholinergic and calcium channel receptors in the ventricle was not affected by the treatment. The results of this study suggest that the long-term antihypertensive effects of verapamil in the S/JR rat do not involve an alteration in the binding characteristics of adrenergic, cholinergic, or calcium channel receptor sites in ventricular and renal membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To prove this hypothesis, effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of a pyrogen, penicillin-G (Pc), on the blood pressure and rectal temperature (RT) were investigated. The ICV injections increased the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and the abdominal sympathetic activity (SNA) dose-dependently in urethane-anesthetized rats. In conscious rats, Pc (100 U) elicited the two components of rises in MAP (+19 +/- 1 and +20 +/- 1 mm Hg), and both the RT and HR increased corresponding to the second phase of MAP responses (+1.0 +/- 0.1 degree C and +60 +/- 7 beats/min). ICV injections of an angiotensin II (ang II) antagonist significantly decreased the MAP (-30 +/- 4 mm Hg), HR (-106 +/- 13 beats/min), and the RT (-0.9 +/- 0.1 degree C). ICV injections of Pc elicited drinking behavior (the vehicle group; 1.1 ml/90 min vs Pc group; 8.6 ml) in rats water-deprivated for 24 hours. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), ICV injections of Pc elicited augmented responses in the first phase but diminished in the second pressor phase. ICV injections of an ang II antagonist elicited augmented effects in both the MAP (-39 +/- 1 mm Hg) and RT (-0.8 +/- 0.1 degree C) in SHRs. Thus, RT fluctuated corresponding to the blood pressure level in the latter phase, where a brain ang II mechanism may be involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tertatolol (5 mg) or nadolol (80 mg) were administered orally at an interval of 1 week in a random order as a double-blind, cross-over study. Cardiac output was measured by Doppler echography, and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured by constant infusion techniques using 123I-iodohippurate and 51CR-EDTA, respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 hours after ingestion of the drugs. Both nadolol and tertatolol decreased blood pressure and cardiac output to a comparable extent. Renal blood flow remained unchanged, so that the renal fraction of cardiac output increased from 14.4 +/- 1.5% to 21.3 +/- 2% after nadolol and from 14.8 +/- 2.4% to 20.5 +/- 1.8% after tertatolol (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.01 before vs. after; nadolol vs. tertatolol was not significant). The glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged, from 68 +/- 9 to 64 +/- 6 mL/min.m2 after nadolol and from 71 +/- 8 to 67 +/- 7 mL/min.m2 after tertatolol (before vs. after and nadolol vs. tertatolol levels were not significant). These results show that both tertatolol and nadolol redistribute cardiac output to the kidneys in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

Labetalol HCl (Trandate) is a unique adrenergic blocking agent that can smoothly lower blood pressure following bolus injection without increasing heart rate or cardiac output. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of intravenous boluses of labetalol HCl in the treatment of patients presenting to the hospital with a diagnosis of hypertensive urgency (diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg). After baseline blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, 20 consecutive patients were treated with an initial 20-mg bolus of labetalol.

Blood pressures and heart rates were recorded at the time of response or following the last dose of labetalol. Mean (+/- SEM) supine systolic blood pressure decreased from 185 +/- 3 to 155 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) following labetalol therapy, and mean supine diastolic pressure decreased from 120 +/- 2 to 98 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05).

In comparison to placebo, ketanserin treatment at 40 mg bid for 6 weeks lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 148 +/- 4/92 +/- 3 vs. 140 +/- 6/86 +/- 3 mm Hg, P = 0.19/0.02. The rate of platelet aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine was unchanged while the response to serotonin was greatly diminished. Neither the systemic pressor response nor the pupillary mydriatic response to phenylephrine was significantly altered. Plasma norepinephrine concentration declined significantly. Ketanserin reduced blood pressure, particularly the diastolic component, in elderly men with mild hypertension. While antagonism of serotonin's effects on platelet aggregation was evident, blockade of alpha 1-receptor-mediated events was not apparent. The results suggest that during chronic therapy the antihypertensive effects of ketanserin were mediated by serotonergic blockade and a possible lytic effect on sympathetic drive. The dual effects of ketanserin on blood pressure and platelet aggregation may be beneficial in reducing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients.\r"

One group was treated during the normal time course for development of hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy (beginning at age 4 weeks), while the other was treated after stabilization of hypertension/hypertrophy (21 weeks). Appropriate age-matched controls (WKY strain) also were treated. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to monitor action potential configuration, automaticity, and the incidence of arrhythmias (including delayed afterdepolarizations and repetitive tachyarrhythmias) in isolated left ventricles from each group. The younger rats did not develop hypertension of left ventricular hypertrophy; susceptibility of isolated left ventricles to histamine-induced (10(-5) M) arrhythmogenesis was significantly reduced. The older rats showed decreased blood pressure, although not to normal levels; further left ventricular hypertrophy was prevented, though the existing enlargement did not regress. These hearts were as susceptible to the development of histamine-induced arrhythmias as were hearts of untreated SHR. Enhanced susceptibility to arrhythmias in hypertrophied hearts reflects a preventable alteration of the myocardial cell membrane that occurs during the course of blood pressure elevation. This change may be associated with defective sarcolemmal calcium transport in hypertrophied myocardium.\r"

OKY 046 a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, tempered proliferation of VSMCs in SHRs, but not in WKY rats. STA2, a stable analog of TXA2, stimulated VSMC growth in WKY rats more than in SHRs. It is indicated that vascular TXA2 generation is enhanced, and partially participates in the rapid proliferation of VSMCs in SHRs.\r"

Although neither ICV hypertonic NaCl or IV AII infusion alone had any substantial pressor effect, concomitant administration of these resulted in a consistent and significant increase in the blood pressure on day 7 over the baseline value, amounting to 29 +/- 5 mm Hg (n = 9; P less than 0.001). Inasmuch as the increase in the BP was totally prevented by intraperitoneal injection of guanethidine (40 mg/day), hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system appears, at least in part, responsible for the BP elevation caused by the combination of ICV hypertonic NaCl and IV subpressor AII infusion.\r"

Measurements of mean abdominal aortic blood pressure (MAP) were obtained in anesthetized offspring at 5, 15, and 25 days of age. This was greater in neonatal S/JR rats than R/JR rats at 5, 15, and 25 days of age. A hypertensinogenic effect of 8% NaCl was seen in R/JR at 5 and 15 days. The results indicate that the ontogeny of MAP can be influenced by pre- and postnatal dietary NaCl.

Blood pressure was gradually increased by DOCA-salt treatment. Serum NA was also elevated with time by DOCA-salt, and significantly higher in DOCA rats on the 4th treatment week, as compared with controls. By contrast, DOCA-salt did not alter CSF Na at any time of treatment. No relationship was detected between BP and CSF Na at any stage of DOCA-salt hypertension. The precent fall in BP by AVP antagonist or hexamethonium was always greater in DOCA-treated rats than that in the controls. These hypotensive effects were gradually, but consistently enhanced with the development of hypertension in DOCA rats. It is concluded that the enhanced activity of both SNS and AVP system responsible for DOCA-salt hypertension may be attributed to the mechanism(s) unrelated to the increased CSF Na concentration.\r"

The increase in cell Na+ content resulted in a more marked stimulation of outward Na+, K+ than of inward Li+, Rb+ cotransport fluxes (with stoichiometries not very different from one-to-one). These results suggest that in human erythrocytes and in nonepithelial cells with small but outwardly directed electrochemical Cl- gradients, the [Na+, K+, Cl-]-cotransport system may behave as a \"second pump\" by using the extra energy supplied by an additional net [K+, Cl-] efflux. The [Na+, K+, Cl-]-cotransport system (of vascular cells and/or noradrenergic endings) may play two different roles in primary hypertension: (a) \"defective second pump\" in some essential hypertensive patients with decreased cotransport affinity for internal Na+ and (b) \"compensatory second pump\" in other forms of primary hypertension where abnormalities in the Na+, K+ pump or in other ion transport systems may predispose the cell to a defective extrusion of excess cell Na+ content.\r"

Investigation of this hypothesis was facilitated by the use of: a) Sr2+, a slowly transported Ca2+ analogue, and b) new quasispecific inhibitors of Na+:Ca2+ exchange such as 2',4'-dimethylbenzamil. Preliminary experiments in mouse macrophages showed that the initial rate of Sr2+ uptake lasted for at least 15 minutes and was therefore easier to measure than the initial rate of unidirectional isotopic Ca2+ influx (which lasted less than 30 seconds). In cells with normal Na+ content, basal Sr2+ influx (432 +/- 77 mumol [L cells X h]-1; mean +/- SEM of seven experiments) exhibited properties compatible with a ground membrane leak for divalent cations (quasilinear dependence on the external Sr2+ concentration, partial or full resistance to external Ca2+, Ba2+, verapamil, and 2',4'-dimethylbenzamil). Membrane depolarization by external K+ was unable to modify basal Sr2+ uptake. Conversely, a 100% increase in cell Na+ content by preincubation with ouabain increased the rate of Sr2+ uptake by 233 +/- 48 mumol (L cells X h)-1 (mean +/- SEM of seven experiments). 2',4'-Dimethylbenzamil, but not the Ca2+ antagonists diltiazem or methoxyverapamil, inhibited ouabain-stimulated Sr2+ influx (IC50 of about 3 X 10(-5) M). 2',4'-Dimethylbenzamil was also able to inhibit Na+ efflux (by 3.05 +/- 0.98 mmol (L cells X h)-1; mean +/- SEM of three experiments) suggesting the existence of Na+:Sr2+ exchange.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before and at the end of each period, we measured blood pressure; intraerythrocyte magnesium, sodium, and potassium (R-Mg, R-Na, and R-K); and erythrocyte ouabain (10-4 M) sensitive sodium efflux rate constant (Kos). The same measurements were also performed in 21 untreated age-matched essential hypertensives (EHT group). In the Th group, R-Mg was lower, R-Na was higher, and Kos was lower than in the EHT group before magnesium supplementation. Oral magnesium resulted in a significant increase in R-Mg (p less than 0.005) and a decrease in R-Na (p less than 0.01), together with an increase in Kos (p less than 0.005) in the Th group. During magnesium supplementation, the increased Kos was correlated negatively with the lowered R-Na (r = -0.57, p less than 0.01) and positively with the increased R-Mg (r = 0.61, p less than 0.005). Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were reduced significantly during magnesium administration by a mean of 7.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mm Hg. The results indicate that long-term diuretic treatment may give rise to an intracellular magnesium deficiency and a suppression in cell membrane active transport for sodium, with a resultant increase in intracellular sodium content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratios did not correlate with patient age or plasma renin level. This preliminary finding suggests that the role of plasma calcium in hypertension may need to be analyzed in the context of overall calcium metabolism, as influenced by the parathyroid hormone. The role of an altered relationship between plasma calcium level and parathyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension remains to be studied.\r"

Pressor responses to electrical nerve stimulation or exogenous norepinephrine were inhibited by ketanserin, in a dose-dependent manner. Norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation was also suppressed by ketanserin. Inhibitory degrees of pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation by ketanserin were significantly greater in SHRs than those in WKY rats. These results suggest that ketanserin could affect presynaptic neurotransmitter release from the adrenergic nerve endings in resistance vessels. These sympatho-depressive actions might contribute, at least partially, to the hypotensive mechanisms of ketanserin.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental hypertension is often associated with decreased renal mass and/or impediments to normal renal compensatory growth. This has led to the hypothesis that the renal growth factor (renotropin) is also a vasoconstrictor responsible for elevated blood pressure. Unilateral nephrectomy (uni) is the most popular mechanism to investigate compensatory renal growth. Accordingly, we examined the vasoconstrictive potential of rat sera following uni in order to compare it with serum renotropic activity. Compared to sham-operated (sham) rat sera, uni sera obtained at 24 hours after operation, a point in time when renotropic activity is highest, stimulated the constriction of isolated rat aortic rings significantly more than sham sera, and in a dose-dependent fashion. By paired analysis, the differences in constriction between uni and sham sera were significant at all doses examined. Unlike those obtained at 24 hours, uni sera did not show this response 48 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks after operation, simulating the temporal course of renotropin found in sera after uni. The uni serum factor was not influenced by dialysis suggesting that its molecular weight exceeds 6,000 daltons and that the vasoconstrictive response was not due to electrolyte differences between uni and sham sera. Vasoconstrictive activity was retained after serum passage through Affi-gel blue to remove albumin and after serum was heated in boiling water for 5 minutes. We conclude that a heat resistant serum vasoconstrictive factor with a molecular weight greater than 6,000 daltons arises shortly after uni but disappears once the remaining kidney begins to undergo a physiological compensatory growth response.\r"

Continuous Performance test confirmed abnormal daytime sleepiness and correlated with minimum oxygen saturation and number of transitions between stages. Postoperatively, questionnaire scores fell a mean of 62%, indicating a marked improvement in subjective sleepiness. Changes in questionnaire score correlated with changes in minimum oxygen saturation. Mean PSG indexes showed no change. Individual patients without PSG improvement reported long-term improvement in daytime functioning, as confirmed by family members. These results suggest that measures in addition to PSG, including patient subjective response, would more fully characterize the outcome of revision of the upper airway for sleep apnea.\r"

The advantages rendered by this method are the feasibility of an early one-stage craniofacial reconstruction and avoiding retraction of the frontal lobes and damage to the olfactory filaments. The reduction of pseudohypertelorism, the decompression of the optic nerve, and the meticulous reconstruction of the midface and skull base are performed in one session and are regarded as one entity.

Our method is more sensitive than the more common method of tympanometry. Information is supplied for the patient's evaluation before and after treatment.\r"

The results were satisfactory for reconstructing details of complicated temporal bone structures. This system is equipped with such functions that it is possible to observe the reconstructed structures from an arbitrary direction, and to investigate their internal aspects by cutting and drilling. Three-dimensional reconstruction by this method is useful not only in understanding the fundamental anatomy and stereoscopic relationship of various parts of the temporal bone, but also in simulating temporal bone surgery on reconstructed three-dimensional images.\r"

A porcine panniculus carnosus myocutaneous flap model was utilized to study the effects of ancrod on flap perfusion and viability. Ancrod treatment appeared to increase perfusion at one distal flap site, as measured by dermofluorometry. A small but not statistically significant increase in percent of viable flap surface area was also observed in ancrod-treated piglets.\r"

Serial echocardiograms were performed 2-10 days after the acute event and patients were followed up for three months. Anticoagulation treatment was started only after the detection of thrombi. Of the 55 patients in whom a thrombus developed, 15 (27%) had peripheral emboli between 6-62 days; but only two (2%) of 95 patients without thrombus had emboli. Among 15 variables, the best single predictors of embolisation were age greater than 68 years (80% sensitive, 85% specific), pendulous thrombus (60%, 93%), and independent thrombus mobility (60%, 85%). Logistic regression analysis showed that a formula that included patient age, thrombus area, and the length of thrombus in the ventricular lumen predicted embolisation (sensitivity 87%, specificity 88%). There was no correlation between age and the thrombus variables. The risk of embolisation from left ventricular thrombi in acute anterior myocardial infarction can be accurately assessed from patient age and echocardiographic features. The risk of peripheral emboli is high in patients with left ventricular thrombi and those aged greater than 68.\r"

Aneurysms with larger communication orifices are less likely to rupture. Echocardiographic and angiographic criteria have been devised to classify left ventricular aneurysms into two distinct types. In four cases of inferior aneurysms the echocardiographic and angiographic criteria were typical of a \"false aneurysm\" but the defects were diagnosed as true aneurysms after intraoperative and histological examination. These aneurysms were characterised by their site in the inferior wall and by late diagnosis and treatment, which may have influenced their occurrence and determined the development of their characteristic shape. These findings suggest that the classic echocardiographic and angiographic diagnostic criteria for \"false\" aneurysms may have to be abandoned.\r"

M mode and continuous wave Doppler traces with a simultaneous electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram were analysed to identify time intervals that could be used to distinguish patients who needed valve operation from those who did not. An interval of less than 55 ms between the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2) and the cessation of mitral retrograde flow was a powerful predictor that the patient required operation (sensitivity 100% and specificity 86%). The mean (SD) value of this variable in group 1 (40(15) ms) was significantly lower than in group 2 (90(35)ms) and group 3 (75(20)ms). Mean isovolumic relaxation time was less than normal in group 1 but did not differ significantly between groups. Deceleration of regurgitant velocity at end ejection was greater in group 1. The pressure drop from the left ventricle to the left atrium at A2 of less than 50% of the peak gradient also identified patients who needed valve operation (sensitivity 75% and specificity 68%). These findings may help to identify patients who require operation. They suggest that there are significant differences in the dynamics of flow velocities in patients with mitral regurgitation, possibly related to the relative resistances to retrograde and anterograde and anterograde flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The other haemodynamic indices did not change significantly. In six patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg) nifedipine significantly increased systemic output, stroke volume, and heart rate, and significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance and the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio.

Because catecholamines are often required to maintain adequate cardiac output after surgical correction the effect of preoperative treatment with beta blockers on the response to isoprenaline after the operation was investigated in nine children given propranolol before operation and nine who were not. They were studied three and 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. The haemodynamic response to increasing doses of infused isoprenaline was monitored. Immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass the response to isoprenaline was significantly blunted in the patients who had been given propranolol before operation. Their dose-response curve lay to the right of that for patients not given propranolol, and this indicates competitive inhibition. Propranolol concentrations in the blood and myocardium correlated significantly with the heart rate response to isoprenaline. Twenty four hours after operation the isoprenaline response was similar in both groups and concentrations of propranolol in the blood were minimal or undetectable. beta Blockers given up to the time of operation significantly altered the postoperative response to catecholamines.\r"

The predictive value of the data at two and 12 months was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The best correlation was found for age, hypertension, bundle branch block, early and late heart failure, x ray cardiothoracic ratio, digoxin use, the number of metabolic equivalents reached during the stress test, echocardiographic wall motion score index, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the presence of an aneurysm. The prognostic value of the same data at 12 months was studied in those surviving for two months. There was a noticeable decline in the relative risk of all but two of the factors (number of metabolic equivalents, ventricular arrhythmias). All of the predictive variables except the x ray cardiothoracic ratio, number of metabolic equivalents, and the presence of an aneurysm lost their discriminant power. The explanation for this is the strength of statistical relations of these variables with the outcome at two months. They continued to influence the score at 12 months even when the entire patient series was considered. In conclusion, the study shows that the predictive value of most of the predischarge variables usually taken into account in the assessment of risk in patients one year after infarction does not extend beyond the first two months.\r"

Venous air was infused at rates of 0.25, 0.30, and 0.35 ml kg-1 min-1. Spillover of venous bubbles into the arteries was detected with a Doppler ultrasonic probe located over the suprarenal aorta. At the lowest venous air dose (0.25 ml kg-1 min-1), no bubbles were detected in the systemic circulation in the pentobarbitone- or halothane-anaesthetized dogs, while arterial bubbles were detected in two with isoflurane anaesthesia. At 0.30 ml kg-1 min-1 air, one, four and two dogs had arterial bubbles detected with pentobarbitone, halothane or isoflurane anaesthesia, respectively, while at 0.35 ml kg-1 min-1 spillover of bubbles occurred in four, five and three, respectively.

Since the NMDA excitatory receptor on neurones is implicated in ischaemic neuronal necrosis, ketamine might be expected to have a beneficial effect in cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia. Ketamine was tested in a rat model of forebrain ischaemia allowing 7 days recovery. Ketamine 6 mg kg-1 i.v. was administered 5-10 min before ischaemia in one group of rats, and ketamine 60 mg kg-1 day-1 i.m. for 3 days and 7 continuous days after ischaemia in two other groups. An additional group received ketamine 24 mg kg-1 i.v. before ischaemia and 120 mg kg-1 day-1 i.m. after ischaemia for 7 days continuously. Control rats received ischaemia but no treatment. The results were compared with untreated controls by neuropathological examination of the entire brain, sectioned subserially. There was no significant difference in necrosis between treated and untreated groups after any of the ketamine regimens. The findings demonstrate that systemically administered ketamine fails to protect the brain against hypoxic-ischaemic injury in the rat.\r"

The results demonstrate that trainees who undergo a graduated training programme using simulators are initially more successful at awake fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation than those who have learned in the traditional manner, and that the conditions of the investigation were acceptable to the trainees and patients.\r"

The first, MHS(B), has a high initial release rate followed by a constant release for the remainder of a 12-h period. The second, MHS(S), has the same constant release rate for 12 h. MHS(B) is intended to attain and maintain analgesic or near analgesic plasma concentrations of morphine, and MHS(S) to maintain that concentration for successive 12-h periods. The pilot studies suggest that MHS may be of value in the management of postoperative pain.\r"

There was marked individual variation in the serum morphine concentrations produced following each route of administration. The maximum serum morphine concentration following inhaled morphine was approx. six times lower than that after morphine i.m. and the time of occurrence differed significantly (P less than 0.001). The individual relative bioavailabilities of inhaled morphine varied from 9% to 35%, with a mean of 17%.\r"

Twelve patients suffering from cerebral haemorrhage or from cranial trauma and treated with mechanical ventilation were examined for radiological and bacteriological signs of sinusitis with CT-scanning, and cultures of nasal pus discharge. All patients showed radiological signs of sinusitis within 3 days after intubation. They all developed fever, six with a known focus outside the sinuses. There was an even distribution of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is concluded that sinusitis should be considered where fever occurs without known focus in patients with nasotracheal intubation.\r"

These pedigrees mainly involve cases of eclampsia which occurred before its recent decline in incidence. The data confirm the genetic determination of susceptibility indicated by published data on eclampsia/preeclampsia. There is a suggestion that the fetal genotype can contribute to susceptibility to eclampsia in its mother, in contrast to previous findings that susceptibility to pre-eclampsia is controlled solely by the maternal genotype. An association between eclampsia and miscarriage is shown in the data. We argue that this suggests that the primary mode of action of the gene(s) involved is to affect the interaction between uterine and placental tissue.\r"

The reproductive success rate decreased with the number of previous miscarriages from 80% in women with two, to 60% with three and 46% with four or more miscarriages. No effect of age and socio-economic status emerged. There was a positive association between the number of previous miscarriages and the risk of miscarriage in the next pregnancy. Compared with women with two miscarriages the relative risk of another miscarriage was 2.3 for those with three previous miscarriages and 5.0 for those with four or more (chi 2 1 for trend adjusted for age = 5.2, P = 0.02).\r"

Eighteen were tested whilst their mothers breathed either air or a 12% oxygen in nitrogen mixture. The test was repeated the following day with the order of the gases reversed. In addition five fetuses were tested while their mothers breathed air on both occasions. Of the 18 fetuses 17 had a normal habituation pattern when tested in air but only two had a normal pattern when their mothers breathed 12% O2. Four of the five fetuses tested both days in air had normal patterns on the second day. Altering the amount of inspired maternal O2 alters the fetal habituation pattern.\r"

The increase of putrescine and spermine in acid-hydrolysed urines during pregnancy appeared to be almost completely due to increases in monoacetylated putrescine and N1,N12 diacetylated spermine, respectively. The latter two were the quantitatively most important polyamines in amniotic fluid. In urine, monoacetylated putrescine showed the highest levels at the end of pregnancy, whereas N1,N12 diacetylated spermine reached the highest values at about 32 weeks gestation. It was impossible to establish whether extracellular monoacetylated putrescine is linked either to cell growth or cell loss. The appearance of N1,N12 diacetylated spermine is probably due to cell loss and dependent on the degree of differentiation during fetal development. The decline and eventual disappearance of urinary N1,N12 diacetylated spermine during the first 2 years after birth may be coherent with maturation of the FAD-dependent polyamine oxidase activity.\r"

The intake of zinc in the diet of the Gujerati Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups was only one quarter of the US recommended intake during pregnancy and was approximately one half in the Harrow Indian groups. Even so, the plasma concentrations of zinc were similar in all dietary groups in either India or Harrow. The albumin content in the plasma of both the Gujerati Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian was significantly reduced when compared to the equivalent Harrow dietary groups. The plasma concentrations of both calcium and sodium were significantly correlated with the albumin concentration but not with the plasma content of zinc.

The two methods of detecting urine loss agreed in all but four women with very slight genuine stress urinary incontinence, two being detected by one but not by the other of the two tests. In only 5 of 25 patients was incontinence demonstrable clinically without bladder filling, and in only 13 of 25 was it demonstrable in the supine position. These proportions were 5 of 21 and 10 of 21, respectively, for those with genuine stress incontinence, with or without coexistent detrusor instability. Bladder filling provoked uncontrollable voiding in five women, two had detrusor instability on cystometry, and two had low peak urinary flow rates on uroflowmetry. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of selecting patients for urodynamic testing.\r"

However, the pattern of complications was found to have changed in three respects. Firstly, there was a fall in the frequency of raised intraocular pressure requiring treatment associated with the abandonment of intracapsular surgery and the use of chymotrypsin. Secondly, a considerable number of patients who had had extracapsular extractions suffered from visually disabling posterior capsular thickening (13%). Thirdly, there was a downward trend in the rates of vitreous loss and of reduced vision at three months due to vitreous haemorrhage, vitritis, and retinal detachment in the patients undergoing extracapsular cataract surgery.\r"

The ocular tissues were studied by light microscopy, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and autoradiography. The cells which contributed to the inflammatory response (initially neutrophils, then later macrophages and lymphocytes) were found to gain entry into the vitreous via the pars plana, pars plicata, and the vessels associated with the optic nerve head. In the experimental eyes the detached retinae had a reduced ability to incorporate 3H proline. Both epiretinal and subretinal membranes were found on the retinal surfaces. The majority of the glial cells within the membranes were identified as Muller cells. The retinal pigment epithelium beneath the detached retinae incorporated 3H thymidine and detached into the subretinal space. Clear evidence was obtained of both epithelial cell migration through the retina and involvement within epiretinal membranes.\r"

The present study examines compaction in the nucleus by measuring the change in dimensions of congenital lamellar cataract with time and by comparing the different dimensions of dominantly inherited lamellar cataract in individuals of different ages in the same family. It is now shown that compaction affects the nucleus at a decreasing rate with increasing age and that the rate of compaction of lamellar cataracts is faster the greater diameter of the affected lamella. It is concluded that compaction of lens fibres towards the centre of the lens affects all regions of the cortex and nucleus in youth and that the compaction becomes largely or completely confined to the cortex in middle age and beyond. The shape of the lamellar cataract changes from a lenticular shape in youth to a rounded shape with increasing age. This accounts for the development of the peripheral divergence of the zones of discontinuity of the cortex, which allows the lens to remain emmetropic with increasing age in spite of changes in surface curvature.\r"

  ".W": "No study has yet been done to investigate the changes in endothelial cell size, perimeter, and density that may result from the warming of corneas in MK (McCarey-Kaufman) medium for specular microscopy. In the present investigation eye bank eyes were stored in MK medium at 4 degrees C and rewarmed daily for six days at 37 degrees C before specular photography of the endothelium was performed. These photographs were compared with wet mount preparations stained with trypan blue and alizarin red made from the same corneas and those stored without rewarming for six days. In addition all corneas were qualitatively analysed with the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The data from serial specular photography were insufficient to allow significant conclusions to be drawn about day to day changes in cell morphology. However, analysis of wet mount preparations revealed that cell density and perimeter varied significantly between those corneas rewarmed daily and those held in cold storage for six days. SEM studies showed an intact cell monolayer with cell loss along the folds of corneal endothelium. We therefore concluded that repeated rewarming at 37 degrees C of corneas stored in MK medium at 4 degrees has a deleterious effect on cell morphology and that folds induced by swelling of corneal tissue result in endothelial cell damage with some loss.\r"

  ".W": "A new generation of arc welder has recently become widely available at a price which is within reach of most amateurs and part-time mechanics, known as the MIG welder (metal-arc inert gas welder). In MIG welding the arc is ensheathed in a stream of inert gas which prevents the molten metal from oxidising. The stream of gas changes the character of the emitted radiation, and it is possible that this type of welder poses a greater threat to sight than previously recognised. Radiation in the ultraviolet range emitted by arc welders is absorbed by the unprotected cornea and lens, giving rise to a keratoconjunctivitis, or 'arc-eye,' which, though intensely painful, is not considered a threat to sight. Radiation in the visible and near infrared spectrum, however, penetrates the eye to be absorbed by the retina and may cause thermal or photochemical damage which may be permanent and sight-threatening. Retinal injuries resulting from exposure to ordinary electric welding arcs have been reported, but such injuries are uncommon. Two cases of retinal burns resulting from exposure to MIG welder emissions which presented on consecutive days to the Leicester Royal Infirmary are presented. This is the first report of such injuries relating specifically to MIG welding.\r"

Data from a previous study of patients diagnosed from 1962 to 1968 have been included for analysis of incidence and second primary tumours, and for study of trends in treatment. The registration rate in Britain (which may be about 10% less than the true incidence) is about one in 23,000 live births, approximately 40% of cases being known to be genetic. There is no apparent trend in incidence during the period covered by these two studies. The three-year survival rate in 88%. Patients with bilateral tumours have a better survival rate than those with unilateral tumours for the first few years, but their long-term survival rate is worse because of later deaths from ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma or second primary neoplasms. Older children tend to have a worse prognosis, which is related to the fact that their tumours are diagnosed at a more advanced stage. There is a significantly higher survival rate for boys than for girls; this is partly accounted for by difference in age and stage at diagnosis between the sexes. Children referred to units specialising in the treatment of retinoblastoma have a higher three-year survival rate than those treated at other hospitals. Comparing methods of treatment between the periods 1962-8 and 1969-80, we find there has been a trend towards more conservative treatment. The use of chemotherapy is now usually reserved for recurrences and metastases and for palliative treatment in terminal retinoblastoma.\r"

The electroretinogram b wave was especially susceptible to the effects of the rodenticide, and the target tissue appeared to be the retinal pigment epithelium. Injection of PNU itself did not produce ocular toxicity. The poison had to be administered orally. Gentamicin administered orally with PNU prevented the ocular toxicity. Presumably this antibiotic killed those gastrointestinal bacteria responsible for PNU's metabolism into an ocular toxin. L-tryptophan, a known antidote for the lethal effects of PNU, was an antidote for the ocular toxicity when administered orally but not when administered parenterally.\r"

Series of fields in which the second field was depressed relative to the first were selected for analysis to determine how much change between the first two fields was required to predict a downward trend as confirmed by the third field in the series. The data were stratified with respect to initial field damage. Seven regions of the visual field were analysed including the upper and lower temporal and nasal quadrants, the superior and inferior Bjerrum regions, and the whole field. Minimally damaged regions required between 4.7 and 5.6 dB change in mean sensitivity, whereas more damaged regions required between 5.5 and 7.2 dB change in mean sensitivity to have 95% confidence that the negative trend would be confirmed by the third field. The superior Bjerrum region was the most sensitive for the detection of change, and the lower temporal region was the least sensitive. We conclude from this series of data that large changes between two successive fields are required to be sure that the changes are due to disease rather than chance fluctuation. Where any doubt exists, the field should be repeated to confirm the reality of change.\r"

The right PED was treated by placing a row of argon laser photocoagulation along the margin of the PED, with avoidance of the papillomacular bundle. Five days after treatment the PED enlarged peripherally beyond the coagulated site. Nineteen days later an RPE tear developed at the temporal edge of the detachment in the right eye. The remaining detached RPE retracted centrally, forming curled folds. About 40 days after the initial examination the patient complained of sudden reduction of vision in his left eye. At this time an enlargement of the PED was found in his left eye. One week after this examination a small RPE tear was found in the nasal border of the PED in the left eye. The tear in the left eye gradually developed centrally to the fovea.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of various substitutions and deletions resulting in beta-thalassemia was studied in 19 black patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia and in numerous relatives; all patients were from Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. Methodology included gene mapping, amplification of genomic DNA with Taq polymerase, identification of known nucleotide substitutions or a single nucleotide deletion through hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides, cloning and sequencing of a beta-globin gene, and sequencing of amplified genomic DNA. Of the 38 chromosomes tested, 21 (55%) had the A----G substitution at nt -29, eight (21%) had the C----T substitution at nt -88, three (8%) had the substitution at codon 24, while one each of the following abnormalities were also detected: frameshift at codon 6, a C----A mutation at nt 848 of the beta IVS-II (new), an A----T mutation at codon 61 (new), a deletion of 1.35 kilobases including the 5' end of beta, a Ggamma(Agammadelta beta) degree-thalassemia, and one thalassemia determinant that remained unidentified. The C----A mutation at nt 848 of IVS-II occurred at a position 3 nucleotides 5' to the third exon, adjacent to the invariant AG dinucleotide of the acceptor sequence. The A----T mutation in codon 61 (AAG----TAG) resulted in the creation of a stop codon and thus in beta degree-thalassemia. The various mutations occurred on chromosomes with different haplotypes; however, chromosomes with a specific mutation but with different haplotypes belonged to one specific framework, which suggested that crossovers were responsible for these different types. Hemoglobin (Hb) F levels were generally high (55% to 75% with 98.5% in one patient with beta degree/beta degree); a few patients with specific haplotypes and an alpha-thalassemia-2 heterozygosity had a lower Hb F level. The Ggamma in the Hb F was consistently high when the C----T mutation occurred at nt -158 to the Cap site of the Ggamma-globin gene; seven patients with +/+ at this site had an average Ggamma of 73.8%, eight patients with +/- had 64.8%, and one patient with -/- had 34.2%. Variations in hematologic values and in Hb F, Ggamma, and Hb A2 levels of relatives with a beta-thalassemia heterozygosity depended to some extent on the types of mutations or deletions and on the haplotypes of the chromosomes with the beta-thalassemia determinant.\r"

  ".W": "The proband with lifelong hemolytic anemia has a high K0.5s phosphoenolypyruvate (PEP) erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) variant substantially but incompletely normalized by the allosteric modifier fructose-1,6-diphosphate (F-1,6-P2) with conversion of sigmoidal to hyperbolic kinetics. Heterozygotes in four generations express qualitatively identical but less severely abnormal kinetics and lack overt hemolysis. Kinetic abnormalities are closely mimicked by sulfhydryl modification of normal PK. Three distinct clinical and metabolic phenotypes characterize the proband and two sisters: variant PK and hemolytic anemia, variant PK without clinical manifestations or hemolysis, and complete normality. Their mother, whose red cell PK is entirely normal except for a questionably slightly low Vmax, is postulated to express the gene products of nonidentical alleles, one encoding a product with mildly less favorable catalytic characteristics. At low PEP concentrations, the proband and heterozygotes for the PK mutant express only a very small fraction of normal PK activity despite apparent inheritance of one normal allele in the latter. Evidence suggests that disproportionately lowered PK activity may be a property of a heterotetrameric PK. Illusory abnormalities in nucleotide specificity are artifacts of diminished substrate affinity characterizing the mutant PK.\r"

  ".W": "Since it is not known why sickle RBCs tend to undergo microvesiculation, we have investigated their susceptibility to thermal stress. While normal RBCs start to vesiculate at 49.0 +/- 0 degrees C (n = 14), sickle RBCs begin to vesiculate at 47.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C, with a range of 46.5 to 48.5 degrees C (n = 14). This abnormality is reproduced by treating normal RBCs with phenazine methosulfate (PMS), which stimulates the excess intracellular generation of superoxide characteristic of sickle RBCs. For PMS-treated RBCs, there is a strong correlation between membrane protein thiol oxidation and vesiculation temperature (r = .977, P less than .001). The abnormal vesiculation temperature of both unmanipulated sickle RBCs and PMS-treated RBCs is significantly improved by treatment of the RBCs with dithiothreitol. The most dense sickle RBCs are most prone to vesiculation during thermal stress, and they are the subpopulation having the greatest amount of thiol oxidation. We conclude that the tendency of sickle RBCs to vesiculate during thermal stress is further evidence for functional abnormality of the RBC cytoskeleton due to thiol oxidation.\r"

DAF is anchored to the plasma membrane on normal cells by a phosphatidylinositol linkage. The investigators found that a purified phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C cleaved C8bp from the surface of normal lymphocytes and monocytes. This finding indicates that the abnormal complement sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes arises from a common defect, the inability to attach the phosphatidylinositol-containing anchor that is necessary for the membrane expression of both membrane complement regulatory proteins, the C8bp, and DAF.\r"

Four cases exhibited complex aberrations involving several chromosomes, sometimes with a mosaicism. In two patients with an initial abnormal karyotype, further cytogenetic analysis during the disease course showed the appearance of additional clonal anomalies, and particularly of a probable Philadelphia (Ph1) variant in one case. Treatment was essentially supportive. Survival was significantly shorter in group II (median, 30 months) compared with group I (median, not reached at 6 years; P = .015). In univariate analysis, other parameters significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P less than .05) were higher age, anemia, and increased percentage of circulating blasts.

Although exposure to foreign antigens borne on donor leukocytes appears necessary to provoke primary sensitization, the stability of leukocyte antigens during routine platelet storage is largely unknown. Accordingly, we serially measured the expression of surface markers on leukocytes derived from platelet concentrates during storage using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Our results indicate that the expression of class I HLA antigens, Leu-4 (T cell), and HLe-1 (pan leukocyte) remained stable on lymphocytes under standard platelet storage conditions, but that the percentage of lymphocytes bearing class II HLA antigens declined significantly over time. This decline in lymphocyte HLA class II expression was associated with a significantly diminished ability of stored leukocytes to stimulate blastogenesis in mixed lymphocyte culture. However, leukocytes retained the ability to respond in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) following storage. We also performed studies on lymphocytes cultured in the presence of cyclohexamide, which suggested that the expression of class I HLA antigens and B2 microglobulin are highly sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis, whereas the expression of class II HLA antigens, Leu-4, and HLe-1 are not. Our results may prove useful in understanding the mechanisms that lead to platelet refractoriness and in designing strategies to prevent HLA alloimmunization.\r"

When PMC purified to greater than 99% purity were cultured in methylcellulose with IL-3 and IL-4, approximately 25% of the PMC formed colonies, all of which contained both berberine sulfate-positive and berberine sulfate-negative mast cells. When these mast cells were transferred to suspension culture, they generated populations that were 100% berberine sulfate-negative, a characteristic similar to that of mucosal mast cells (MMC), and that synthesized predominantly chondroitin sulfate [35S] proteoglycans. When \"MMC-like\" cultured mast cells derived from WBB6F1-+/+ PMC were injected into the peritoneal cavities of mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice, the adoptively transferred mast cell population became 100% berberine sulfate-positive. In methylcellulose culture, these \"second generation PMC\" formed clonal colonies containing both berberine sulfate-positive and berberine sulfate-negative cells, but exhibited significantly less proliferative ability than did normal +/+ PMC. Thus, clonal mast cell populations initially derived from single PMC exhibited multiple and bidirectional alterations between CTMC-like and MMC-like phenotypes. However, this process was associated with a progressive diminution of the mast cells' proliferative ability.\r"

  ".W": "A difference in recognition of the adhesive glycoprotein vitronectin (also called S-protein, serum spreading factor, and epibolin) by monoclonal antibody 8E6 (Hayman EG, et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80:4003, 1983) was investigated using a competitive enzyme-immunosorbent assay and immunoaffinity chromatography. Recognition of vitronectin in serum was approximately 50-fold greater than recognition of vitronectin in plasma. Recognition of vitronectin incubated with heparin, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, or heparin and thrombin-antithrombin III complex together was 2.5-, 7-, or 32-fold greater, respectively, than recognition of vitronectin alone. Thrombin or antithrombin III by itself did not induce the antigenic change. Factor Xa-antithrombin III was less effective than thrombin-antithrombin III in induction of the change. Dextran sulfate and fucoidan were more potent than heparin in induction of the antigenic change, whereas dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, or keratan sulfate were less effective. Immunoblotting analysis of serum and of vitronectin incubated with thrombin and antithrombin III demonstrated the presence of complexes composed of vitronectin and thrombin-antithrombin III that could only be dissociated with reducing agent. N-ethylmaleimide completely blocked the formation of the presumably disulfide-bonded complexes and partially blocked the antigenic change. Both non-disulfide-bonded and disulfide-bonded vitronectin bound to antibody-Sepharose from a mixture of vitronectin and thrombin-antithrombin III. Treatment of vitronectin with 8 mol/L urea resulted in enhanced recognition by the monoclonal antibody. Thus, the 8E6 antibody reacts with an epitope that is preferentially expressed by noncovalently and covalently linked vitronectin/thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and by urea-treated vitronectin. The change in vitronectin induced by thrombin-antithrombin III, therefore, is a physiological correlate of urea treatment and of adsorption of vitronectin onto tissue culture plastic (as is done in cell adhesion assays). The change may be important for expression of vitronectin activity.\r"

In this study, we compared the contribution to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation of the A alpha chains in Fgn molecules containing predominantly (fraction 1-2) or exclusively (peak 1 Fgn) gammaA chains with that of molecules containing approximately 50% gamma' chains (peak 2 Fgn). Using washed human platelets, we confirmed that the number of peak 2 Fgn molecules binding to platelets in the presence of ADP was about half the number of peak 1 Fgn molecules (18,962 +/- 2,298 v 44,366 +/- 16,096 molecules per platelet), and that isolated S-carboxymethylated (SCM) gammaA chains supported ADP-induced platelet aggregation nearly as well as peak 1 Fgn. In contrast, SCM-gamma' chains alone supported aggregation poorly, whereas a mixture of SCM-gammaA and gamma' chains (1:1 ratio) gave intermediate results. Despite the findings with isolated SCM-gamma' chains, we found that peak 2 Fgn supported platelet aggregation nearly as well as peak 1 Fgn. However, peak 2 Fgn from which carboxy (COOH)-terminal A alpha chain segments had been removed by digestion with plasmin showed a markedly decreased platelet aggregation potential. Peak 1 Fgn core fraction from an 88% to 90% coagulable plasmin digest, or Fgn fraction 1-9, which has a high gammaA/gamma' chain ratio (93:7), but lacks COOH-terminal regions of A alpha chains, supported platelet aggregation to the same extent as did intact peak 2 Fgn. These findings indicate that Fgn molecules containing gamma' chains can approach the aggregation potential of Fgn molecules containing predominantly or exclusively gammaA chains only if intact A alpha chains are also present.\r"

The IgG fraction from each of nine patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia caused heparin-dependent platelet release of radiolabeled serotonin. Both the Fc and the Fab portions of the IgG molecule were required for the platelet reactivity. The platelet release reaction could be inhibited by the Fc portion of normal human or goat IgG, and patient F(ab')2, but not F(ab')2 from healthy controls. These results suggested that the Fab portion of IgG binds to heparin forming an immune complex and the immune complexes initiate the platelet release reaction by binding to the platelet Fc receptors. To directly challenge this hypothesis, we preincubated the serotonin-labeled platelets with the monoclonal antibody against the platelet Fc receptor (IV.3). This monoclonal antibody completely inhibited the release reaction caused by heparin and patient sera, as well as heat aggregated IgG, but did not block collagen or thrombin-induced platelet release. Heparin-dependent platelet release also could be inhibited in vitro by the addition of monocytes and neutrophils, but not by red cells, presumably because the Fc receptors on the phagocytic cells have a higher binding affinity for IgG complexes than do platelets. Platelets from patients with congenital deficiencies of specific glycoproteins Ib and IX (Bernard-Soulier syndrome) and IIb and IIIa (Glanzmann's thrombasthenia) displayed normal heparin-dependent release indicating that the release reaction did not require the participation of these glycoproteins. These studies indicate that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an IgG-heparin immune complex disorder involving both the Fab and Fc portion of the IgG molecule.\r"

Specimens were studied immediately before alpha-IFN therapy, at 6-month intervals during, and in six patients 6 months after cessation of therapy. All patients presented with increased bone marrow fibrosis ranging from focally increased reticulin to a diffuse increase in both reticulin and collagen content. This fibrosis was observed to decrease during alpha-IFN therapy inasmuch as the hairy cell population was diminished in the bone marrow in 13 patients. Regression analysis of HCl v bone marrow fibrosis showed a positive correlation (r = .73, P less than .02). Six patients demonstrated a reduction in bone marrow reticulin and collagen to normal levels during alpha-IFN therapy. Two of six patients demonstrated increased bone marrow fibrosis and HCl 6 months after cessation of alpha-IFN therapy.

  ".W": "HLA immunization is a common complication of transfusion therapy in 30% to 60% of oncohematologic patients. Evidence shows that leukocytes present in cellular blood products are the main component involved in the occurrence of HLA immunization, and several studies showed that leukocyte-poor blood products are less able to induce it. However, leukocyte-poor platelet concentrates obtained by conventional techniques, ie, centrifugation, frequently have a high level of remaining leukocytes. Cotton wool filter Imugard IG 500 can be used to obtain leukocyte-poor cellular blood products. The technique is easy to perform, even in an emergency, and can be used with either packed RBCs or platelet concentrates. Means of 97%, 92%, and 76% elimination of leukocytes are obtained for packed RBCs, pooled standard platelet concentrates, and single-donor platelet concentrates, respectively. Patients were randomized to receive either standard (control group) or filtered (leukocyte-poor group) blood products. Of 112 randomized patients, 69 were evaluable, 35 in the control group and 34 in the leukocyte-poor group. Both groups are comparable according to age, diagnosis, sex ratio, previous transfusions, and pregnancies. There is a significant difference in regard to the HLA immunization rate (31.4% in the control v 11.7% in the leukocyte-poor group, P less than .05) and frequency of refractoriness to platelet transfusions (46.6% v 11.7%, P less than .05). We conclude that this filtration technique can be an efficient means to reduce the HLA immunization rate in polytransfused oncohematologic patients.\r"

  ".U": "88327150\r", 
  ".W": "The contention that erythropoietin (Epo) affects platelet production was investigated in the rat with recombinant human Epo (rHuEpo). In normal rats, Epo caused a dose-dependent increase in both reticulocyte and platelet numbers, the reticulocyte response preceding that of platelets. Withdrawal of Epo resulted in reticulocytes and platelets returning to control levels. [75Se]-selenomethionine incorporation into platelets was also enhanced in response to Epo. Chronic daily administration of rHuEpo resulted in steady state erythrocyte levels after 12 to 14 days, which were elevated 20% above controls. Attainment of this steady state was associated with both reticulocytes and platelets returning to control levels despite continued administration of Epo, an effect not associated with a change in the half-life of circulating Epo. In polycythemic rats a platelet response was observed before an effect on reticulocytes. Erythropoietin caused a 2.4-fold increase in the frequency of small acetylcholinesterase-positive cells within 24 hours, and increased the mean megakaryocyte diameter within 48 hours. Furthermore, the [3H]-thymidine labeling index of megakaryocytes from rats treated for 24 hours with rHuEpo was increased for all stages of megakaryocyte maturation. These results support the proposal of an effect of Epo on rat megakaryocytes causing increased platelet production.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (MoAb) recognizing a membrane-associated erythroid burst-promoting factor was prepared by immunizing BALB/c mice with plasma membrane-derived vesicles exfoliated from lymphocytes under serum-free conditions. Hybrids secreting antibody reactive with lymphocyte plasma membranes were formally cloned and IgG was purified from monoclonal supernatants or from BALB/c mouse ascites fluid. Two clones (D3-E4 and D3-G9) were found to suppress burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) proliferation when added directly to serum-free human marrow culture. Inhibition to a level of 100% was observed in a dose-dependent fashion over a wide range of antibody concentrations (0-200 micrograms/mL). Neither antibody altered the proliferation of colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) or colony forming unit-granulocyte-erythroid-monocyte-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells in human bone marrow culture. The D3-E4 clone was found to produce an IgG1 antibody which adsorbs an erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) from supernatants of, and octylglucoside extracts of shed vesicles present in, serum-free, lymphocyte conditioned medium (LCM), and which recognizes a vesicular protein of Mr approximate 30,000 on immunoblots of membrane proteins electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/polyacrylamide and transferred to nitrocellulose. In contrast, the D3-G9 clone was found to produce an IgG1 cytotoxic antibody. These antibodies will be important to the study of cell-cell and growth factor-cell interactions in vitro.\r"

A report on the survival rate among a substantial number of patients with aplastic anemia showed that patients who sought medical care at the hospital after 1973 had a better survival rate than those who sought care before 1973; the extent of improvement in the survival rate was almost equal to the extent of decrease in the mortality rate. The supply of platelet concentrates was found to increase with the decrease in the age adjusted mortality rate. Although there were several factors that affected the mortality rate from aplastic anemia, the major recognizable factor seemed to be therapeutic improvement, mainly due to the platelet concentrates. Probably neither a decrease in the incidence nor factors related to the data processing of vital statistics played a major role.\r"

The excellent definition of the nerve rootlets and axillary pouch that are obtained with a water-soluble contrast medium resulted in more root lesions per patient being detected than with an oil-based medium. There was complete correlation with the surgical findings at all but one root level explored. The appearances of root avulsion injuries and the advantages of using a water-soluble contrast medium are discussed.\r"

By applying these standardized criteria, patients undergoing surgery can be divided into those having curative or non-curative operations, or operations which are indeterminate for cure. These recommendations represent the first step in ensuring uniformity in the classification of patients with colorectal cancer.\r"

Defaecation was less frequent in women than in men (P less than 0.01) but was independent of the presence of haemorrhoids. Patients with haemorrhoids and control subjects reported similar stool consistency and rarely admitted to straining. Severely constipated women complained of infrequent defaecation, straining at stool and hard motions, but none had prolapsing haemorrhoids. Haemorrhoids were associated with significantly longer anal high-pressure zones and significantly greater maximum resting pressures at all levels of anal distension (P less than 0.01), but minimum residual pressure during rectal distension and maximum squeeze pressure were not significantly different from control subjects. Maximum resting pressure was increased in patients of both sexes with haemorrhoids, but this reached statistical significance only in men (P less than 0.001). Constipated women had normal anal pressure profiles and maximum anal pressures. These data show that patients with haemorrhoids are not necessarily constipated but tend to have abnormal anal pressure profiles and anal compliance. Chronically constipated women do not necessarily have haemorrhoids but have normal anal pressure profiles and compliance. This casts doubt upon the hypothesis that haemorrhoids are caused by constipation.\r"

The superoxide-producing capacity of neutrophils, which was examined using N-formyl-peptide or phorbol myristate acetate as an attractant, significantly decreased postoperatively to 55 and 69 per cent of the pre-operative values, respectively. The leukotriene-producing capacity of neutrophils, which was stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of arachidonic acid, significantly changed postoperatively. The leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production increased together with an increment of production of 6-trans 6-trans LTB4, however, increased postoperatively to 1.2 times the (LTC4) production decreased postoperatively. The total production of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) metabolites consisting of LTB4, LTC4, and 6-trans LTB4, however, increased postoperatively to 1.2 times the pre-operative values. This indicates that neutrophils in the postoperative period have a higher capacity for LTA4 production but a lower capacity for superoxide production than those in the pre-operative period.\r"

The occurrence of intra-abdominal complications was found to be linked to premature (i.e. within 3 months) closure of the stoma. Reasons for premature closure were stomal difficulties and prerenal azotaemia. Stomal closure was attended by a 10 per cent mortality rate.\r"

Most of the studies have been designed to test survival difference and, following diagnosis, patients were treated by a variety of surgeons and methods. We present clinical and pathological data on 32 asymptomatic patients who were screened and found to have breast cancer. Investigation and treatment was performed by one surgeon according to a defined protocol. We confirm that mammography is a more sensitive diagnostic tool than palpation and describe how a review of the patient with the suspicious mammogram will increase the incidence of palpable tumours. We stress the importance of fine-needle aspiration cytology as a diagnostic and localization method. The low incidence of axillary node metastasis in patients with invasive carcinoma is described. More importantly, no patient in this series required treatment by mastectomy. In our experience patients with breast cancer detected by screening are eminently suitable for treatment by breast conservation.\r"

Thirty-four patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty between 1983 and 1987 were studied, and the follow-up varied from 1 to 47 months (mean 22 months). We found no increase of gastritis and intestinal metaplasia after surgery, and we did not observe any case of gastric dysplasia. Only one patient with pre- and postoperative specimens showed a deterioration in gastric histology after surgery, and this was of a minor degree. These initial results are encouraging for surgeons interested in the treatment of morbid obesity.\r"

They represented 54 per cent of all stomach cancer patients reported to the Cancer Registry in Norway during the study period, and data are analysed for three hospital levels (local, county and university hospitals). The median age was 71 years (range 18-96 years). The median pretreatment delay was 113 days, and 46 per cent of patients had a performance status (Karnofsky index) of less than or equal to 80. The diagnosis was confirmed by pre-operative histology in 88 per cent of cases. In all, 88 per cent of patients underwent surgery, the resectability rate was 67 per cent and 50 per cent had a potential curative operation. Total gastrectomy was most commonly performed. Lymph node dissection was performed in 14 per cent of those undergoing a curative resection. The postoperative complication rate was 27 per cent but varied with the type of operation, being highest in proximal resection (55 per cent) and lowest after distal resection (19 per cent). A total of 7 per cent of the patients died postoperatively. Most patients had advanced disease at the time of treatment and only 6 per cent had stage I tumours. There were significant differences in patient and treatment characteristics between the three hospital levels. In conclusion, patient selection bias which will influence results does occur. A fairly aggressive attitude towards local disease was found, but the low proportion of patients undergoing lymph node dissection not only leads to questions regarding the efficacy of this treatment policy, but also casts doubt on the validity of staging of stomach cancer. Morbidity and mortality rates are still high. The consequences of the differences revealed between hospital groups are difficult to interpret. Proponents of both regionalization of treatment and small hospital care may find arguments for their case in the data.\r"

  ".W": "Ischaemic foci within the abdomen attract omental and peritoneal adhesions with neovascularization. Previously it has been shown that transmural amoebic colitis is an ischaemic process. An intra-operative evaluation of the peritoneal barriers in response to necrosis was undertaken during laparotomy in 82 patients with clinical transmural amoebic colitis. At operation the ischaemic colon was covered by adhesive wraps in all patients; peritonitis subsequently was absent in 23 patients (28 per cent), serous in 43 patients (52 per cent), purulent in only 9 patients (11 per cent) and faeculent in another 7 patients (9 per cent). The author regards wrapping as mechanically protective. Wrapping is also a source of neovascularization which was demonstrated on 10 angiograms of resected specimens with transmural disease. This is further supported by clinical finding of subsequent necrosis of colons in three patients whose wraps were disturbed at laparotomy without resection of the colons. Therefore, for both mechanical and vascular reasons, these wraps should not be disturbed.\r"

Passive immunisation alone was available in the first six months of life until 1985, after which infants received passive and active immunisation from birth; in addition, some infants received passive immunisation for six months followed by a course of hepatitis B vaccine. All but a few infants received the first immunising dose within 48 hours after birth. Blood samples for analysing markers of hepatitis B virus were available at 1 year from 147 of the 223 infants given passive immunisation, 54 of the 72 given passive followed by active immunisation, and 102 of the 155 given passive and active immunisation at birth. At 1 year 11 of the 127 (9%) infants given four or more doses of specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen compared with four of the 20 given three or fewer doses; 11 had levels of hepatitis B surface antibody greater than 50 IU/l. Only one of the 54 infants given passive then active immunisation was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at 1 year and four infants had low (less than or equal to 50 IU/l) levels of hepatitis B surface antibody. Four of the 102 infants who received passive and active immunisation at birth were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN--Non-randomised multicentre cohort study with 3 month follow up and 13 month data collection period. SETTING--Lithotripter centre in London, tertiary referral hospital, and urological clinics in several secondary and tertiary care centres. PATIENTS--933 of 1001 patients treated by lithotripsy at the lithotripter centre were compared with 195 treated by nephrolithotomy. Missing patients were due to incomplete collection of data. Age and sex distributions and characteristics of the stones were similar in the two treatment groups. Two patients died in the lithotripsy group. Three month follow up was achieved in about 84% of both groups (783/933 for lithotripsy; 163/195 for nephrolithotomy). INTERVENTIONS--The nephrolithotomy group had surgical nephrolithotomy alone. In the lithotripsy group 83% (774/933) had lithotripsy alone, 11% (103/933) had combined lithotripsy and nephrolithotomy, and 6% (56/933) had lithotripsy plus ureteroscopy. Single and combined lithotripter treatments were analysed as one group and compared with nephrolithotomy. END POINT--Presence of stones three months after treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Presence of residual stones was assessed by plain radiography, ultrasonography, or intravenous urography. After adjustment for age and size and position of stone for patients with single stones the likelihood of being free of stones three months after treatment was significantly greater in the nephrolithotomy group than the lithotripsy group (odds ratio 6.6; 95% confidence interval 3.0 to 14.6) and the response was particularly pronounced with staghorn calculi (62% (8/13) v 15% (141/96) patients free of stones after nephrolithotomy and lithotripsy, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Practically all Swedish births between 1983 and 1985 were included, 281,808 births in all. The overall rates of late fetal death and early neonatal mortality were 3.5 and 3.1 per 1000, respectively. About 30% of the pregnant women were recorded as being daily smokers. Logistic regression analyses showed significant relative risks for late fetal death for high maternal age (1.4), nulliparity (1.4), multiparity (greater than or equal to 2) (1.3), smoking (1.4), and multiple births (2.8). Significant relative risks for early neonatal mortality were found for multiple births (4.9) and smoking (1.2). Smokers aged under 35 faced a relative risk of late fetal death ranging from 1.1 to 1.6, while the risk for late fetal death was doubled if the mothers were aged 35 years or more and smoked. In countries like Sweden, where maternal cigarette smoking is prevalent, smoking may be the most important preventable risk factor for late fetal death.\r"

Data were obtained from cases and hospital controls by interview. Use of antithyroid drugs in the week before the onset of illness was compared in 262 patients with agranulocytosis and 1771 controls. Forty five patients (17%) and five controls (0.3%) had used antithyroid drugs. The relative risk was estimated to be 102 (95% confidence interval 38 to 275) taking into account confounding by other factors, including the use of other drugs. The excess risk for use of antithyroid drugs in any one week was estimated to be 6.3 cases of agranulocytosis per million users. Use of antithyroid drugs in a five month period ending one month before admission to hospital was compared in 135 patients with aplastic anaemia and 2145 controls. Four patients (3%) and five controls (0.2%) had taken drugs; the estimate of relative risk was 9.2 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 47) after control for confounding. The estimate of excess risk of agranulocytosis with the use of antithyroid drugs was lower than found previously. Although the excess risk for aplastic anaemia was not calculated, these data suggest that it is very low.\r"

After a run in period of six months patients were randomly given the book, the tape, both the book and tape, or neither. Patients' knowledge of the use of drugs, perceptions of their disability, skill in using an inhaler, consumption of drugs, consultations with their general practitioners, morbidity (from patients' entries on diary cards), and use of the educational material were measured. Knowledge about the use of drugs was significantly increased in the groups who received the material after three months and persisted after 12 months. Patients who had been given the tape or the book and tape increased their scores of knowledge of drugs more than patients given the book alone. Patients in all groups given the material considered that their disability was reduced. There were no other significant changes. Patients given both the book and the tape preferred the book. Patients with asthma can obtain useful information from such material. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which may be acquired better from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which may be acquired better from a book.\r"

  ".U": "88327332\r", 
  ".W": "The question whether the aggregated published research suggests that breast self examination is beneficial was explored in a meta-analysis of 12 studies including a total of 8118 patients with breast cancer that related the practice of breast self examination to regional lymph node state or tumour diameter. Based on the six studies for which data were available, 39% of patients (1115/2852) who reported having done breast self examination at least once before their illness had evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes compared with 50% of women (1348/2713) who had not done the examination. Logistic regression analysis showed this difference to be significant (odds ratio 0.66, confidence interval 0.59 to 0.74). Combining six studies which reported the circumstances of detection disclosed that 42% of women (272/652) who found their tumour while doing breast self examination had evidence of cancer in the nodes compared with 46% of women (871/1901) who found the tumour accidentally; this difference was not significant. Analysis of eight studies which used the diameter of the tumour to indicate the extent of disease tended to confirm the findings on lymph node state, in particular the benefit of premorbid breast self examination. Significantly fewer women who had practised the examination before the illness (56%; 1205/2137) had tumours of 2 cm or more diameter compared with women who had not practised the examination (66%; 1500/2260). The combined odds ratio for that analysis was 0.56, confidence interval 0.38 to 0.81. These findings appear to be good evidence of the benefit of encouraging women to practise self examination of the breasts regularly.\r"

The mean of two standardised measurements of blood pressure was related to the reported consumption of alcohol and measurements of height, weight, pulse rate, and electrolyte excretion. Several significant correlations were found with both systolic and diastolic pressure, but only the coefficients for age, body mass index, and pulse rate were greater than 0.1. Alcohol consumption showed a weak positive correlation with blood pressure in men. Sodium excretion showed a weak positive correlation with blood pressure in both sexes, and potassium excretion showed weak negative correlations. In multiple regression analysis age, pulse rate, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and potassium excretion had significant independent effects but sodium excretion did not. Although measuring blood pressure twice on one occasion and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion only once may have weakened any potential correlation, the most likely explantation of these results is that the relation between sodium and blood pressure in the population is weak and that potassium and alcohol are of greater importance.\r"

  ".W": "The domiciliary consultation scheme introduced at the start of the NHS enables joint consultation between a consultant and general practitioner in a patient's home when the patient cannot attend hospital on medical grounds. Consultants claim a fee from the NHS, general practitioners do not. Data from the Department of Health and Social Security on domiciliary consultations in England and Wales during 1981-6 were analysed. The number of domiciliary consultations fell during 1981-6 from 429,759 in 1981 to 387,394 in 1986, a fall of 10%, whereas the numbers of consultants and general practitioners increased by 1404 (12%) and 2400 (10%), respectively. The yearly rate of domiciliary consultation per consultant fell by 19% from 36 in 1981 to 29 in 1986 and that per general practitioner by 18% from 18 to 15. In 1986 geriatric medicine had the highest rate of domiciliary consultation per consultant (187) followed by psychiatry (89), general medicine (52), dermatology (49), rheumatology (42), general surgery (36), gastroenterology (35), thoracic medicine (34), and orthopaedics (30). In 1986 all specialties apart from clinical pharmacology and therapeutics and clinical genetics showed a decrease in the yearly rate of domiciliary consultation when compared with the rate for 1981. Domiciliary consultation seems to have become a domiciliary visit by the consultant alone. At an estimated cost of about 20m pounds for 1988 the scheme needs critical evaluation.\r"

But the value of tobacco tax revenues have generally fallen--by 1986 they were 10% lower than at their peak in 1965, and tobacco revenue is becoming a smaller proportion of total tax receipts. The impact of a consistent increase in tobacco taxation is important in terms of reduced consumption (and harm to health) as well as in terms of reduced employment. Revenue may, however, increase in the short term. Finally, if the findings of Townsend and Atkinson et al (see above) still apply then the distributive effects of increased taxation on the poor might be less than is sometimes feared.\r"

Though over half had difficulties in swallowing and symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux, the symptoms occurred only occasionally and were regarded as inconsequential by most. One third of the patients had wheeze and a quarter had at least one episode of bronchitis a year, but these interfered little with daily activities. Overall, these results are encouraging for young patients with oesophageal atresia and their families.\r"

The women graduates spent about 10 hours less a week on patient care than their male colleagues. Personal and professional factors were cited most often as determinants of practice location. Approximately 20% of the practising graduates chose to locate in small towns or rural areas. Accessibility to consultants and opportunities for continuing medical education were reported as vital prerequisites for more physicians to move to smaller Alberta centres. These findings provide a starting point for studies designed to determine how Alberta medical school graduates are contributing to patient care within the province.\r"

  ".W": "Students are introduced to techniques of physical examination at medical school. However, their skills are deficient at the time of graduation, and with the increasing shift of clinical teaching away from the bedside and into the conference room it is expected that these skills will weaken in succeeding generations of physicians. A practical and satisfactory method of addressing this problem during internship and residency training has not been forthcoming because of the lack of a regular forum for the teaching of clinical skills in busy tertiary referral hospitals and the shortage of teachers with the necessary skills and commitment to teaching a large number of house staff. We describe a program whose unique hierarchical approach has permitted a detailed ongoing review of physical examination. One clinician was able to teach 24 residents by instructing a small group of senior residents, who in turn, after practising with clinical clerks, taught groups of junior residents.\r"

In an attempt to assess the significance of wound contamination by tumor tissue, the incidence of local recurrence in 28 cases of known wound contamination was determined. The influence of immediate lavage, re-excision, subsequent surgical margin, and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy upon local recurrence was assessed. Achieving a wide surgical margin by immediate re-excision after contamination gave a significantly lower incidence of recurrence than those with lesser final margins (P less than 0.01). The use of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or irradiation resulted in a lower recurrence rate, but the difference between those with and without adjuvant treatment had statistically less significance than the surgical margin on the incidence of local recurrence (P less than 0.2). The risk of local recurrence after contamination was not influenced by the histologic grade of the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "The patterns of disease extent, response to treatment, and survival rates were examined in 129 children registered as metastatic (Group IV) soft-tissue sarcoma patients on the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS)-I protocol from November 1972 through October 1978. The patients' ages at diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 21 years (median, 10.5 years); 72 were male patients and 57 were female patients (male-to-female ratio, 1.3:1). The tumor arose in an extremity in 34 patients, the head and neck (exclusive of the orbit) in 27, the genitourinary tract in 25, the retroperitoneum or pelvis in 14, the trunk in 12, the intrathoracic region in nine, the hepatobiliary system in four, the perineum in two, and the orbit in two patients. The histologic types of soft-tissue sarcoma confirmed by the pathology review committee were embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in 68 patients, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in 41, undifferentiated sarcoma in 14, embryonal-botryoid in two, pleomorphic in one patient, and other sarcoma in three patients. Of 105 patients who were confirmed in Group IV and had complete information concerning sites of metastatic deposits, 53 patients presented with metastases restricted to only one anatomic region or tissue; the other 52 had diffuse metastases. The most common sites of distant tumor deposits were the lungs, bone marrow, and other soft tissues. After treatment with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide with or without Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Inc., Columbus, OH) and radiation therapy, 65 (50%) of the 129 eligible patients achieved complete disappearance of all detectable tumor. The likelihood of achieving and maintaining a complete response for 2 years was highest among patients whose tumors originated in the genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum-pelvis, or the hepatobiliary or perineum regions. Thirteen of these 45 children (29%) are alive and disease-free at a minimum of 2 years after initiation of treatment. Only 10 of the other 84 (8%) are surviving disease-free at 2 years (P = 0.02). The presence of restricted rather than diffuse metastases at diagnosis (P = 0.02) was the only other characteristic significantly related to long-term complete remissions. One hundred and two patients (79%) died at a median of 47 weeks after diagnosis, 92 from sarcoma and ten from other causes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Before chemotherapy 34 patients (79%) had Stage III or IV carcinomas whereas nine patients had Stage II lesions. The clinical response was very encouraging: 20 patients (46%) achieved a clinical complete response and 23 patients (54%) were judged as partial responders. Side effects of this chemotherapy were minimal and reversible. Between 15 and 22 days after the last course of chemotherapy patients went to surgery. Wound healing complications did not occur. The surgical specimens were tested microscopically. The microphotographs showed small tumor rests with giant cells bordered by fibrous scar tissue and separated from the healthy tissues. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 21-58 months) 74% of patients are alive and 70% remain disease-free. Eleven patients died but only five (11%) because of the failure of therapy. This combined therapy appears both safe and promising treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. A further follow-up study needed to confirm the promising 5-year results.\r"

Principal organs were removed and their 131I uptake was determined. A high radioactivity count was detected in the tumor, indicating efficacy of this antibody in tumor imaging of neuroblastoma. This antibody was labeled with 131I and injected into transplantable human neuroblastoma-bearing mice. Apparent inhibition of tumor growth was observed in animals treated as such compared with animals of the control group, MoAb alone group, and 131I alone group (P less than 0.05).

Thirty-two patients who underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction were examined with respect to a variety of variables available on preoperative evaluation, including lesion width on CT scan, lesion length on CT scan, and barium esophagogram. Each variable was evaluated for its ability to predict the presence of extraesophageal spread of tumor, as determined pathologically by logistic regression analysis. Lesions greater than 3.0 cm in width by CT scan were associated with a significantly higher incidence of extraesophageal spread. Tumor location, gender, histologic grade, presence of in situ lesions, vascular invasion, eosinophilia, nodal metastases, and preoperative chemotherapy had no predictive value for survival. Duration of survival was affected by the presence of esophageal spread of disease and lesion width. These results indicate that preoperative CT scanning can predict extraesophageal spread of tumor, and this is associated with overall survival.\r"

Except for IAP in hypopharyngeal carcinoma, these values were significantly higher than those of controls (IS, P less than 0.01; IAP, P less than 0.05). The overall positive rates of IS and IAP in the patient group were 46% and 37%, respectively. In patients with laryngeal carcinoma the positive rates of serum IS and IAP were found to be elevated as the disease stage advanced. The IS showed a higher positive rate than IAP in the advanced disease stage. Serial studies revealed that all patients who had recurrent disease after the treatment exhibited marked elevation of serum IS levels; in addition, patients with recurrent cancer showed significantly higher IS levels (1507 +/- 464 micrograms/ml) compared to patients who had remained free of disease in the follow-up period (640 +/- 143 micrograms/ml) (P less than 0.001). These data strongly suggests that serum IS and IAP levels are useful parameters for monitoring the disease stage of head and neck cancer patients.\r"

We reviewed diagnoses from contributing pathologists, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) review pathologists and the Pathology Panel for Lymphoma Clinical Studies in 2019 cases from 14 ECOG protocols. Although we found high rates of disagreements in diagnoses, the vast majority of these represented differences which did not impact on protocol eligibility. A total of 221 cases (10.9%) were excluded from protocols, representing a range of 2.8 to 36.7% of cases per protocol. Eighty-six percent of the exclusions resulted from the initial review by the ECOG hematopathologists. Our data indicate that while central pathology review is mandatory for quality assurance in malignant lymphoma (ML) and Hodgkin's disease (HD) protocols, a two-tier review mechanism is not necessary for adequate quality control.\r"

The method consisted of subcutaneously (SC) inoculating tumor cells over the calvaria in nude mice after the periosteum has been disrupted. This resulted in a local tumor causing fragmentation of the bone. The degree of tumor-bone interaction also varied with the type of implanted tumors as shown in radiographic and histologic examinations. All tumors were associated with histologic patterns of classical bone remodeling, including bone destruction with osteoclast proliferation and reactive new bone formation. The evidence presented here suggests that the majority of tumor-bone interaction showed a combination of both features, bone destruction and new bone formation, and the mechanisms whereby tumors interact with bone may vary with the biological properties of the tumor. Our new system would be suitable for studying the biology of local interaction between bone and tumor cells and searching out a method to protect the bone from cancer cells.\r"

Here we report our observations on aberrations of chromosome 1 in malignancies of the uterine cervix. Tumor material obtained from 148 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix and two cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) was analyzed on direct preparations by G-banding. The results showed abnormalities of chromosome 1 to be one of the most common karyotypic changes, with 95% of the patients showing rearrangements of this chromosome. These changes were never seen as the sole abnormality but were always found in association with other chromosomal aberrations. Numerical rearrangements were present in 54% of the cases, with losses of unaltered chromosome 1 predominating. Consistent marker chromosomes included deletions of chromosome 1 at bands q32, p34, q42, p32, and p22, isochromosomes of both the \"p\" and \"q\" arms and translocations, particularly on the long arm. Specific regions on both arms of chromosome 1 (1p11-p13 and 1q21-q32) were preferentially overrepresented in changes involving this chromosome. Certain breakpoints were nonrandomly involved in the structural changes, particularly band 1q32 breaks occurring at this site in 88 instances. The presence of chromosome 1 aberrations in the two cases of CIS suggests that rearrangements of this chromosome are not always a secondary change contributing to the progression of the cancer, but also may represent an early cytogenetic event as in neuroblastoma, some leukemias, and myeloproliferative disorders.\r"

The nuclear DNA patterns had definite, if not significant, correlations with clinical and histologic parameters. For example, 88.2% of the cases classified as Type III were advanced stage disease, whereas early stage cases were predominant in Type Ia. Type II and III were frequently found in hepatic, peritoneal, and lymph node metastasis. The rate of occurrence of polyploid cells was significantly higher in the group with hepatic or lymph node metastasis than in the other group without metastasis. The results of this study show that fluorometric measurement of nuclear DNA is considered one method of determining the biological activity of gastric cancer cells.\r"

No papillomavirus DNA was detected in 11 noncervical malignancies or in six hysterectomy specimens in which cancer was not present. The histopathologic and clinical features of the patients were correlated with the presence of HPV. The women with papillomavirus DNA in their adenocarcinomas tended to be younger (mean age, 37.3) than those that were negative for HPV (mean age, 49.0).

Before therapy, CEA levels in patients with extensive disease (median value, 5.8 ng/ml) were higher than those in patients with limited disease (3.0 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). Median survival in patients with pretherapeutic CEA titers of 5 ng/ml or less (median survival, 14.3 months) was significantly longer than in patients with CEA levels greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10 and CEA levels greater than 10, respectively (8.3 and 9.7 months; P less than 0.01). Patients with pretherapeutic CEA levels greater than 10 ng/ml showed a significant decrease (P less than 0.01) of CEA while reaching partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR). In five of 16 evaluable patients, a continuous increase of CEA titers was seen starting at least 3 months before relapse could be defined by clinical, radiologic, or endoscopic means. However, the number of patients for whom CEA serum determinations reliably indicate stage of disease and outcome of therapy is small (at best, 10% of all SCLC patients), and pretherapeutic CEA level cannot be used for individual prognosis. Moreover, it is still uncertain whether earlier detection of relapse in SCLC can improve the therapeutic results. So far, the clinical relevance of serial CEA serum determinations in SCLC patients is rather low.\r"

The authors retrospectively studied 331 patients with NHL, of whom 16 were younger than 3 years old and found that the distribution of histologic subtypes in the very young patients was similar to that in older children. Six patients had small noncleaved cell lymphomas, five diffuse large cell immunoblastic, four lymphoblastic, and one had a diffuse large noncleaved cell lymphoma. The complete remission rate was 62.5% and six (37.5%) patients are long-term disease-free survivors, although remissions in the six children with large cell lymphomas were relatively brief, lasting no more than 7 months. These cases illustrate that NHL should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumors in infants and young children and that the distribution of histologic subtypes is similar to that in older children.\r"

Their course was compared to that in a randomly chosen, concurrently treated, site-matched and stage-matched older head and neck cancer population (matched control). Patterns of recurrence as well as overall disease-free survival in each of the two populations were not significantly different. An important stratification factor, however, was related to tobacco usage. Thirty percent of the young patients denied using tobacco compared with only 9% of the controls (P less than 0.05). The 5-year disease-free survival rate of the young adults who did not use tobacco was 66% compared with 86% for their matched control group with a history of smoking. These differences were most significant in young adults with Stage II disease (P less than 0.05 by log-rank testing). The growth and progression of head and neck cancer in the young adults is characterized by tobacco use patterns; a family history of head and neck cancer in five of 17 nontobacco using young adults raises the issue of an inherent genetic determinant.\r"

  ".W": "To document the presentation, findings, therapy, and postoperative course of lethal papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 56 fatal cases were studied in a retrospective case-matched control fashion. These patients and their controls were taken from a larger series receiving their primary treatment at one institution (Mayo Clinic; 1946-1970). Mean follow-up for the lethal cohort was 8.5 years and 16.6 years for controls. Age, sex, tumor size, histologic grade, extent of disease at presentation, European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and AGES scores (patient's age, tumor grade, tumor extent, and tumor size), and DNA ploidy pattern were found to be significant prognostic factors. The immediate causes of death were most frequently either local airway obstruction or respiratory insufficiency from pulmonary metastases. The results suggest that it is possible, at the time of initial treatment, to assess an individual patient's risk of dying from PTC. Aggressive postoperative adjunctive therapy should be restricted to that minority of patients who are at highest risk of death from PTC.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between breast self-examination (BSE) and survival was evaluated in 2093 women with breast cancer newly diagnosed between June 1975 and February 1979. In this population self-examiners were younger, more educated, and more likely to be white, premenopausal, and married than nonexaminers. Self-examiners also tended to seek medical care more rapidly and to have earlier stages of disease at diagnosis. Five years after diagnosis, the cumulative observed survival rates from breast cancer were 76.7% among self-examiners and 60.9% among nonexaminers (P less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis known sociodemographic and treatment confounders accounted for 25% of the excess of breast cancer deaths among nonexaminers. Approximately half of the remaining survival differential was attributable to the more limited disease among selfexaminers. The residual association between BSE and survival may be related to uncontrolled effects of stage or other unrecognized confounders.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with solitary sternal metastasis of breast carcinoma were treated aggressively, with partial (n = 8) or total (n = 1) resection of the sternum. Parasternal and mediastinal lymph node dissection also was performed concomitantly for every patient. Chest wall defects were reconstructed with acrylic resin plate (n = 3) or rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap (n = 6). All patients received chemoendocrine therapy postoperatively. The median survival of these nine patients was 30 months. The prognosis of the patients (n = 4) with the mediastinal or parasternal lymph node metastasis were poor and all of them died of second relapse within 30 months. The prognosis of those (n = 5) without the lymph node metastasis, however, was quite favorable; three survived more than 6 years. These results suggest that sternectomy should be indicated for the solitary sternal metastasis when no evidence of systemic spread is noted since it can improve the quality of life and occasionally may result in long-term survival.\r"

  ".U": "88327686\r", 
  ".W": "This article documents the study of 383 cases of lung cancer in uranium miners and presents for the first time the relationship of radioactive radon gas and cigarette smoking. There is evidence that alpha radiation from radon gas at exposure levels above 465 working level months (WLM) is a strong contributor to the development of lung cancer. Cigarette smoking plays the most significant role in causing lung tumor; this is also noticed in nonminers who smoke cigarettes. A synergistic or additive effect of these two carcinogens is strongly suggested. The data indicate that small cell tumors develop in younger nonsmoking miners exposed to radon levels above 465 WLM. Lung cancers develop in smoking miners at lower levels of radon exposure than in nonsmoking miners. Based on an average mining experience of 15 years, there is substantial evidence that the present maximum allowable limit of 0.3 working levels (WL), or 4 working level months (WLM) per year, is safe, representing a margin of safety of approximately 10:1. Furthermore, a comparison of these data with the radon levels in some homes, averaging in the neighborhood of 0.025 WL, would indicate that health risks at these levels are negligible. It is suggested that 20 picocuries/liter, which equals 0.10 WL, be the maximum allowable level in homes.\r"

The histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural observations, and in particular the quiescent clinical course of the disease and its control with anti-inflammatory medication, favor a nonneoplastic nature of the lesion. This report documents the presence of an intracardiac plasma cell granuloma for the second time in the medical literature.\r"
