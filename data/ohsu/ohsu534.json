This shrimp lacks an externally differentiated eye, having instead a pair of large organs within the cephalothorax immediately beneath the dorsal surface of the transparent carapace, connected by large nerve tracts to the supraesophageal ganglion. These organs contain a visual pigment with an absorption spectrum characteristic of rhodopsin. Ultrastructural evidence for degraded rhabdomeral material suggests the presence of photoreceptors. No image-forming optics are associated with the organs. We interpret these organs as being eyes adapted for detection of low-level illumination and suggest that they evolved in response to a source of radiation associated with the environment of hydrothermal vents.\r"

In vertebrates, segmentation is most apparent in the somites and the peripheral nervous system, but the existence of repetitive bulges, termed neuromeres, in the early neural epithelium of vertebrates suggests that the CNS may also be segmented. Consistent with this, cranial ganglia and certain neurons are associated with specific hindbrain neuromeres. Here, we report that Krox-20, a zinc-finger gene, is expressed in two alternate neuromeres in the mouse early hindbrain. This pattern subsequently decays and Krox-20 is transiently expressed in specific hindbrain nuclei. In addition, Krox-20 is expressed in early neural crest cells, and then in the neural crest-derived boundary caps, glial components of the cranial and spinal ganglia. The demonstration that neuromeres are domains of gene expression provides molecular evidence for the segmentation of the CNS.\r"

There has been no direct demonstration that expression of these mammalian genes can affect developmental processes, however. Hox-1.4, like other mouse homoeobox-containing genes, has been shown to be expressed in specific regions of the mid-gestation embryo, but is unique in that its highest level of expression in the adult animal is restricted to developing male germ cells. We have introduced a construct carrying the mouse Hox-1.4 gene into the germ line of mice to begin to identify the cis-acting elements required for proper expression and to assess the consequences of increasing Hox-1.4 gene expression. The construct was designed to produce normal Hox-1.4 protein from transcripts that are distinguishable from the products of the endogenous gene. The integrated transgene seemed to exhibit the appropriate tissue specificity of expression, but transcript levels were elevated in certain tissues, particularly the embryonic gut. This overexpression correlated with changes in the normal developmental program of the gut, resulting in an inherited abnormal phenotype known as megacolon.\r"

  ".U": "89127499\r", 
  ".W": "The genetic code is determined by both the specificity of the triplet anticodon of tRNAs for codons in mRNAs and the specificity with which tRNAs are charged with amino acids. The latter depends on interactions between tRNAs and their charging enzymes, and an advance in understanding such interactions was provided recently by the demonstration that a major determinant of the identity of alanine tRNA is located in the amino-acid acceptor helix. Multiple substitutions in many distinct parts of the molecule do not prevent aminoacylation with alanine. Substitution of the G3.U70 base pair with G3.C70 or A3.U70 in the acceptor helix prevents aminoacylation in vivo and in vitro, however, and the introduction of this base pair into tRNA(Cys) (ref. 1) or tRNA(Phe) (refs 1, 2) enables both to accept alanine. The importance of a single base pair in the acceptor helix and the results of recent footprinting experiments promoted us to investigate the possibility that a minihelix, composed only of the amino-acid acceptor-T psi C helix, could be a substrate for alanine tRNA synthetase. We show here that a synthetic hairpin minihelix can be enzymatically aminoacylated with alanine. Alanine incorporation requires a single G.U base pair, and occurs in helices that otherwise differ significantly in sequence. Aminoacylation can be achieved with only seven base pairs in the helix.\r"

Scatchard analysis indicates that one Ca2+ binds tightly, with pK 7.6 x 10(-8) M-1, and the other only weakly. Although Ca2+ is not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism and is 16.6 A away from the alpha-carbon atoms of the catalytic triad Asp 39-His 69-Ser 224, the activity of proteinase K towards the synthetic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide drops slowly to approximately 20% of its original value when it is depleted of Ca2+. This is not due to autolysis of the enzyme. The X-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-free proteinase K shows that removal of Ca2+ from the tight binding site triggers a concerted domino-like movement of five peripheral loops and of two alpha-helices. At a distance of 25 A from this calcium-binding site, the geometry of both the secondary substrate binding site and of the catalytic triad is affected by this movement thereby reducing the activity of the enzyme.\r"

In particular, our algorithm runs on a Connection Machine supercomputer in close-to-real time. It shows several of the same 'illusions' that are perceived by humans. A natural physiological implementation of the model is consistent with data from cortical areas V1 and MT.\r"

Two factors that determine the timing of this event are the distance axons have to grow to reach their targets, which are known to vary, and the rate at which they grow. There have been few studies of axonal growth rate at this stage of development and no comparative study of the relationship between growth rate and target distance. Embryonic chick cranial sensory neurons are located in discrete ganglia and the distance axons have to grow to reach their targets is different for each ganglion, ranging from several hundred to several thousand microns. Here, I show that these neurons differ in their in vivo growth rates; neurons with more distant targets growing faster. In vitro, single isolated neurons from each of these populations grow at a similar rate to that observed in vivo, indicating that growth rate is an intrinsically determined property of neurons before they reach their targets.\r"

In normal individuals T cells are tolerant to most self proteins but we still know little of the mechanism(s) by which tolerance is established. A requisite part of the current negative selection model of self tolerance is the expression of self proteins complexed with major histocompatibility complex molecules in the thymus. As MHC proteins bind antigens and present them to the receptor on the antigen-specific T cell, then for tolerance to self to occur, it is possible that each self protein must be processed and presented by an MHC molecule. As a result of the development of a unique T-cell hybrid reactive to the self protein murine haemoglobin, we have shown that in normal animals this self protein is continuously processed and potentially presented in an MHC-restricted manner. Here we show that self haemoglobin is being processed and presented by thymic antigen-presenting cells as early as gestational day 14. We also demonstrate that three types of thymic stromal cells, namely macrophages, dendritic cells and cortical epithelial cells, can present the haemoglobin self antigen in vivo. This surprising presentation of a self antigen by thymic cortical epithelial cells implies that they could be involved in T-cell development and negative selection.\r"

The discovery of a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and its homology to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors provided a potential molecular mechanism for limb morphogenesis. One prediction of this model is that the receptor must be expressed in the developing and regenerating limb anlage. We investigated the expression of the RAR in the adult newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, whose amputated limbs are capable of regenerating and upon which retinoic acid can act to alter pattern. We report the cloning of cDNAs encoding a functional newt RAR and the localization of high and uniform levels of RAR mRNA specifically in the regenerating cells that control limb pattern. These results indicate that the morphogenic field is established through differential activation of pre-existing retinoic acid receptors rather than differential expression of the RAR gene.\r"

In previous fusion studies, cell-surface antigens and organelles contributed by disparate cell types intermixed within minutes. Using heterokaryons produced with differentiated muscle cells, we demonstrate here that a muscle membrane component, the Golgi apparatus mediating its transport, and a sarcomeric myosin heavy chain are localized in the vicinity of the nuclei responsible for their synthesis. These results provide direct evidence that products (organelle, membrane and structural proteins) derived from individual nuclei can remain localized in myotubes, a finding with implications both for neuromuscular synapse formation and for the carrier state of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

Stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that TLA was a robust predictor of cognitive dysfunction, particularly for measures of recent memory, abstract/conceptual reasoning, language, and visuospatial problem solving. SCC predicted test performance on measures on mental processing speed and rapid problem solving, while VBR did not independently predict cognitive test findings. These findings suggest that cerebral lesions in MS produce cognitive dysfunction and that MRI may be a useful predictor of cognitive dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (IAC) is usually a fatal inflammatory disease with a predilection for small blood vessels. Recurrent cerebral infarction leading to death within a few years is the usual course, but this may be significantly altered by aggressive immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Other diseases may, however, present with similar clinical and angiographic features. Because antemortem diagnosis suggests a therapy, establishing the criteria for diagnosis is important. This report describes clinical, angiographic, and biopsy features, and therapy of five successfully treated patients with IAC. The following specific criteria are recommended for establishing an antemortem diagnosis of IAC: (1) clinical pattern of headaches and multifocal neurologic deficits present for at least 6 months, unless the deficits are severe at onset or rapidly progressive; (2) cerebral angiography demonstrating segmental arterial narrowing; (3) exclusion of systemic inflammation or infection; and (4) leptomeningeal/parenchymal biopsy demonstrating vascular inflammation or exclusion of alternate diagnoses. Based upon the successful management of these five previously unreported patients, as well as others in the literature, the following treatment regimens are recommended for the initial 6 weeks of therapy: (1) prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day, and (2) cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day.\r"

Neurologic complications occurred with the same frequency (35.3% vs 38.7%) and distribution among the two groups. Death occurred in 20.6% of patients with neurologic complications and in 13.6% of patients without neurologic complications (p = 0.23). Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis correlated statistically with the development of neurologic complications (p less than 0.01) and death (p less than 0.01). Among 50 patients discharged from the hospital after receiving only medical treatment for native valve endocarditis, and followed for a mean period of 48 months, there was one patient with mitral valve prolapse and stroke. We conclude that (1) neurologic complications occur with the same frequency in native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, (2) S aureus endocarditis increases the risk of neurologic complications and death, (3) mortality is not significantly increased in patients with neurologic complications, and (4) an episode of treated native valve endocarditis does not increase the natural history of stroke in valvular disease.\r"

We studied 17 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms and unilateral CCAO on angiography to help clarify clinical and radiologic features. Mean age was 62 years; 65% were women. Predominant symptoms and signs included visual-ipsilateral monocular or retrochiasmal symptoms (88%), motor weakness (88%), sensory disturbance (59%), dizziness/lightheadedness (53%), and syncope (24%). Dysarthria, headache, or involuntary limb shaking occurred less frequently. Positionally related symptoms occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. TIAs were often multiple and preceded a stroke or occurred without subsequent stroke in 82%. Hemispheric TIAs contralateral to the CCAO occurred in 41%. Ten patients (59%) suffered stroke, seven (70%) of which were ipsilateral to the CCAO. Vascular risk factors included cigarette use (76%), hypertension (71%), diabetes mellitus (41%), and hyperlipidemia (41%); 82% had two or more risk factors. Known cardiac disease was present in 59%. CCAO was present at the origin of the vessel in most patients. Most had atherosclerotic narrowing of multiple extracranial large vessels. During follow-up, none of the patients had a spontaneous second infarct; five had TIAs, including two with amaurosis fugax, all in the CCAO territory. More restricted external carotid collaterals may, in part, explain the higher frequency of ipsilateral stroke and contralateral TIAs than reported for internal carotid occlusion.\r"

This study retrospectively compares the auditory morbidity of posterior fossa microvascular decompressive surgery before and after the introduction of intraoperative brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). All patients underwent a similar operative procedure performed by a single surgeon. The two groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, and indications for surgery. In the nonmonitored group, auditory morbidity had not declined with increasing experience of the surgeon. Ten of 152 patients (6.6%) suffered a profound hearing loss in the nonmonitored group. In the monitored group, none of 70 patients suffered a profound hearing loss. We attribute this significant decline (p = 0.02) in morbidity to the introduction of intraoperative BAEPs. We believe this to be the first demonstration of a significant decrease in operative morbidity directly associated with the use of intraoperative evoked potential monitoring.\r"

The disorder was described most frequently as jerks, tremors, and spasms affecting the preferred arm distally and primarily during putting. When compared with unaffected golfers, afflicted golfers were significantly older and had more cumulative years of golfing. In 24%, activities other than golfing were affected and 25% reported involvement of body regions beyond the arms.

Unilateral automatisms occurred in 39 of 41 seizures on the side opposite the dystonic limb. Version occurred in 11 of the 41 CPS to the same side as the dystonic posturing and always followed the posturing. Subdural recordings of seven seizures showed ictal onset from the mesial basal temporal lobe. At the onset of dystonic posturing, maximum ictal activity was in the basal temporal lobe with minimal involvement of the cerebral convexity. Unilateral dystonic posturing occurs frequently in CPS of temporal lobe onset and is a lateralizing sign with a high degree of specificity. It probably reflects spread of the ictal discharge to basal ganglia structures.\r"

We designed this study to determine the rate of settling and the amount of agitation needed to resuspend the preparation. To determine the rate of settling, we thoroughly shook three bottles of PHY-S and then left them undisturbed. We took samples from the top and bottom of each bottle with a microsyringe at 15 minutes, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks. We simulated patient administration with daily doses that were measured under good, fair, and poor shaking techniques. We analyzed samples after every tenth dose. After complete resuspension the active ingredient in PHY-S settles at a very slow rate. We found no differences in concentration between the top and bottom until the fifth week in the bottles thoroughly shaken and left undisturbed. Minimal agitation is required to resuspend PHY-S. The well-shaken and poorly shaken bottles in the patient simulation phase exhibited no differences in concentrations whereas the unshaken bottle had differences throughout the study period. Problems thought to be associated with PHY-S may be related to compliance and inaccurate measuring devices.\r"

All exhibited complete recovery of memory and other cognitive abilities after the episode.

Corticospinal tract (CST) signs were a notable clinical finding in 14; however, the age of onset, rate of progression, severity of dysfunction, and duration varied among patients. Ten cases had pathologic changes in the CST. In four of the ten cases, the changes were consistent with an \"axonopathy\" since axons and myelin were both diminished in the CST. These cases may represent CST wallerian degeneration, since they had marked injury to cerebral white matter in the form of chronic inflammation with multinucleated cells, gliosis, and myelin pallor. In five cases, with an average age at death of 31 months, the CST showed poor myelination with relative preservation of axons. These cases may represent delayed myelination or possibly cytokine-mediated injury to newly formed myelin since the CST is one of the last tracts to myelinate in the spinal cord. One child with primary CNS lymphoma had a complicated pattern of spinal injury due to unilateral CST wallerian degeneration possibly superimposed upon delayed myelination, in addition to patchy areas of demyelination associated with perivascular lymphomatous infiltrates. Four children with mild CST signs, ranging in age from 5 to 6 months, had CST myelin pallor that was consistent with the degree of myelination expected for age. We did not find vacuolar myelopathy similar to that seen in adult AIDS, but did note focal vacuolar changes in the thoracic posterior columns in the oldest child.\r"

Here, we present the results of a detailed analysis of ten normal brains also processed in serial sections. The ages ranged from 3.5 to 87 years, all male. Three brains showed abnormalities similar in type to those of the dyslexic, but in far smaller numbers and in different locations: two showed a single cingulate focus--one right, one left; the third brain showed two right supratemporal foci. We conclude that the present form of developmental anomaly is rare in normal brains, and that the findings in the dyslexic brains may be significant.\r"

There was, however, neuronal as well as severe dendritic loss and gliosis in the auditory and sensory cortex that could not have been caused by their functional deprivation or have resulted from a chain reaction of transynaptic atrophy, since their corresponding lower relay nuclei did not display significant atrophy. The finding of cell loss and gliosis in the thalamus in nuclei that do not subserve these two pathways as well as in the red nuclei, inferiro olivary nuclei, and claustrum suggested that HSN-I with deafness is nosologically related to familial multisystem atrophy.\r"

In both, neurologic problems started soon after birth and progressed rapidly to profound mental retardation, microcephaly, blindness, and spastic quadriparesis. Seizures were a persistent problem throughout the course of their illness. The neurologic abnormalities were associated with progressive destruction of brain tissue. We established the diagnosis of sulfite oxidase deficiency by demonstrating the characteristic abnormal metabolites in urine. However, commonly used screening procedures do not detect these compounds, and dislocation of the lenses is usually a late feature of the disease. As a result, the diagnosis may be easily overlooked, especially during infancy. Specific investigations for sulfite oxidase deficiency are indicated for any baby with severe, progressive neurologic disease.\r"

Studies have since shown that the disorder may be heterogeneous, as not all families show this linkage. We tested genetic heterogeneity by the HOMOG computer program in 15 CMT1 pedigrees informative for Duffy. We detected no evidence for heterogeneity in this sample, but when we combined results with previously published lod scores, heterogeneity was statistically significant. Twelve of the 15 families studied did not show linkage to Duffy. We found six of these families to be informative for a chromosome 19 marker, apolipoprotein CII (ApoC2). Despite a previous report showing probable linkage of a non-Duffy-linked CMT1 pedigree to two chromosome 19 markers, we did not detect significant linkage of ApoC2 to CMT1 in these families.\r"

The percentage was the same regardless of the severity of the cervical disease. One hundred ninety-four of the patients had vulvar disease and of these, 164 (85%) also had cervical disease. Twenty-nine of 37 women (78%) with overt vulvar condylomata had cervical disease; 15 of these presented without a Papanicolaou smear, and 13 had cervical disease. We conclude that HPV infection of the female lower genital tract is a multicentric disease. All patients with evidence of HPV infection should undergo colposcopic evaluation of the entire lower genital tract. The significance that this will have on future attempts to cure this infection needs to be studied.\r"

Of 76 male sexual partners examined colposcopically, 58 (76%) had HPV-related lesions. All biopsy specimens were analyzed for specific type of HPV DNA by Southern blot hybridization with probes for HPVs 6, 11, 16, and 18. Sixty-one women had HPV 6 or 11 (6/11), 40 had HPV 16 or 18 (16/18), and in 12 the analysis was negative for these types of viral DNA. Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis of biopsy specimens from recurrent lesions showed the same type of viral DNA as in the primary lesion. Significantly more male partners (28 of 47) with the same HPV type were found among women with HPV 6/11 than among women with HPV 16/18 (P less than .005). Patients with HPV 16/18 had significantly more recurrences (14 of 40) after laser therapy than patients with HPV 6/11 (six of 60) (P less than .001).\r"

Eighty men with minimal disease had a significantly lower treatment failure rate than 75 men with multiple lesions (15 versus 40%; P less than .001). The type of lesions (classical condyloma versus other HPV-associated lesions), visibility (obvious condylomata versus subclinical lesions), and location did not significantly influence the cure rate (P greater than .05). Seventy-six percent of treatment failures were evident at the first follow-up examination. After a follow-up time of 1 year, 95% of men with obvious condylomata and 93% of men with subclinical lesions were disease-free.

Slight cellular atypia was the major finding in the smears from 22 of the C trachomatis-positive women, whereas three patients had more pronounced cell changes. Smears reverted to normal in 18 of the 23 patients who returned for tetracycline treatment and follow-up cytology. All 18 patients had smears showing slight cellular atypia prior to therapy. In five patients who also had cellular changes suggesting a human papillomavirus infection, the smears did not revert to normal after antibiotic therapy during the observation period. These findings suggest that patients with C trachomatis and mild cellular atypia should have antibiotic therapy and repeat smears taken before further treatment is considered. More advanced cellular atypia is unlikely to be caused by C trachomatis.\r"

Levels of CA 125 in peritoneal fluid washings correlated poorly with the presence of obvious intraperitoneal cancer and had questionable reliability when used to evaluate patients clinically free of disease. Positive peritoneal cytology reflected the presence of ovarian cancer, but its absence did not mean that an objective response to chemotherapy treatment had occurred. Disease status correlated best with physical examination and circulating levels of CA 125.\r"

Therefore, we examined placentas from 161 uncomplicated gestations for the presence and severity of acute inflammation in the amnion, chorion-decidua, chorionic plate, and umbilical cord using strict gross and microscopic protocols. Indicators of amniotic fluid infection, specifically umbilical cord inflammation, amnionitis, and inflammation within the chorionic plate were present in 0, 1.2, and 4% of the cases, respectively. Silent chorioamnionitis was rare. There was a statistical association between the presence of acute inflammation and the occurrence of labor at term. Methods of tissue sampling that included a more extensive examination of the site of membrane rupture resulted in an increased frequency of diagnosis of acute inflammation at the site of rupture in vaginal deliveries at term.\r"

An average of 48% of the members had no plans for computerization, although this number was lower (29%) for physicians 36-45 years of age. There was no significant variation of use by physician sex or type of practice (office- versus non-office-based). Word processing and financial management were the most frequently used computer applications; clinical patient care tasks were used much less frequently and were presumably less available, because software for these tasks was also highly desirable. The most desired information services were uniform coding and terminology, high-risk patient management, electronic access to full-text obstetric and gynecologic data bases, and online clinical management protocols. Prescription writing, patient recall by drug, and drug inventory computer applications were among the least requested. Several educational, project development, communication, and member service strategies have been formulated to integrate medical information management activities for ACOG members.\r"

Gynecologists who formerly performed uterine curettage under anesthesia before hysterectomy now often use an outpatient endometrial sampling technique. Although safe, this procedure is complicated by discomfort, cost, and the risk of infection or uterine perforation. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of pre-hysterectomy endometrial sampling. Between 1981-1985, 619 patients undergoing hysterectomy had preoperative endometrial sampling using Vabra aspiration, the Novak curette, or D&C. The endometrial sampling histology was compared with that in the hysterectomy specimen. There were 30 instances in which the endometrial sampling failed to identify either endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. In the two cases of endometrial carcinoma, D&C was the sampling method used. The findings of this study indicate that these three techniques of endometrial sampling are equal in their diagnostic capabilities. The results confirm the need for biopsy in patients with postmenopausal bleeding or with abnormal uterine bleeding at age 35 years or older. Our findings do not support routine endometrial sampling prior to hysterectomy.\r"

Of 30 women treated initially with laser vaporization of inflamed areas, 13 (43%) showed significant improvement. Sixteen patients were treated with perineoplasty and all improved significantly; all became functional sexually although eight had previously failed laser therapy. Women with vulvar vestibulitis can be identified easily with a simple Q-tip touch technique directed at the duct opening. This diagnosis should be considered in the evaluation of women with obscure etiologies of dyspareunia.\r"

This brief sexual inquiry added little time to the office visit, and most of the sexual complaints could be resolved by the gynecologist.\r"

Partial dehiscence of a surgically scarred uterus did occur in one patient who received the device, but a clear relationship between its attempted insertion and the dehiscence was not apparent. Early in the clinical trial, a number of devices malfunctioned; the manufacturer defined and remedied the problem. The intrauterine transducer required no maintenance and appeared to be practical in laboring women. We suggest that the utility of the intrauterine pressure transducer might be enhanced with several modifications, including the addition of a re-zeroing mechanism and a reduction in the device's length.\r"

Seventy-nine of 204 (38.7%) of the preeclamptic women and none of 88 healthy non-preeclamptic women were positive for the D-dimer. Presence of the D-dimer correlated consistently with elevated fibrin(ogen) degradation products, detectable fibrin monomer, and platelet count less than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/L, with a 93.0% sensitivity overall for abnormalities of the same. Among D-dimer-positive women, 66.7% had fibrin(ogen) degradation products less than 10 micrograms/mL, 60.3% had no detectable fibrin monomer, and 82.0% had platelets greater than 100 x 10(9)/L. When compared with D-dimer-negative preeclamptic women, D-dimer-positive women had significantly higher blood pressures prompting delivery, greater proteinuria, more abnormal liver function tests, and higher serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. In addition, they had a greater risk of cesarean section (49.4 versus 34.4%), premature delivery (58.2 versus 20.0%), low birth weight (54.5 versus 20.3%), low Apgar scores, and an abnormally high ratio of female to male offspring (1.72 versus 0.93). Testing for the fibrin D-dimer may be useful in early screening and follow-up for preeclamptic coagulopathy, and may also help to define the subset of patients with severe disease.\r"

Interferon alpha-2b recombinant was injected intradermally into the vestibule in a specific pattern three times weekly for 4 weeks. Fifteen women responded favorably with total absence of vulvar pain. Five women reported flu-like symptoms as a result of the injections. Patients without evidence of papillomavirus failed to respond to interferon therapy. Women with evidence of vulvar papillomavirus failed to respond to placebo but did respond to retreatment with interferon; vulvar biopsy specimens after therapy were negative. Interferon alpha-2b recombinant appears to offer an inexpensive, safe alternative to the more traumatic therapies currently recommended in the specific subset of vulvar vestibulitis patients in whom papillomavirus can be confirmed.\r"

The factor VII level increases in normal pregnancy, but the effect of pregnancy upon the factor VII level in deficient individuals is unknown. We report two cases of factor VII deficiency in pregnancy. In both, factor VII levels were 15% or less in the third trimester and were lower postpartum, suggesting that pregnancy does elevate factor VII in deficient individuals as well. Fresh frozen plasma is the treatment of choice. If the level is very low, fresh frozen plasma can be given prophylactically; otherwise, it should be given if blood loss becomes excessive.\r"

Prompted by these observations, we undertook a search for cases of \"pure\" puerperal psychosis (ie, typical manifestations 3-14 days postpartum) in order to evaluate the clinical background of this phenomenon. Special attention was paid to the medications that the patients had received peripartum. In the last 10 years, out of eight perinatal centers, we found only three cases that fulfilled the criteria of the quoted entity. In all instances, the manifestations of puerperal psychosis had been preceded by the administration of ergot derivatives. Based on the presented data, we hypothesize that typical postpartum psychosis may represent an idiosyncratic reaction to potent vasoactive drugs including ergot derivatives. The similarities between the clinical manifestations of ergotism and puerperal psychosis, and some of the epidemiologic features of the latter condition, appear to implicate ergot alkaloids as potential causative agents. Although the validity of the suggested interpretation requires further evaluation, we believe that the currently available data warrant caution with regard to the administration of ergot derivatives postpartum. These drugs should not be used in the absence of clear indication or in unnecessarily high doses. We suggest that ergotism be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of pure puerperal psychosis.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual case of a mullerian adenosarcoma of the peritoneal mesothelium in a 32-year-old pregnant woman is described. On emergency laparotomy, a tumor was found in the pelvis connected with the right broad ligament only, and was removed. Light and electron microscopic examination showed a rare example of an extrauterine mullerian adenosarcoma composed of a stromal sarcoma, muscle tissue resembling primitive myoblasts, and sex-cord-like tubular lumens. The patient was followed, and after 22 months the primary surgery was reexplored. On laparotomy, no evidence of disease was found, and the ovaries were tumor-free. Histologic examination of the pelvic peritoneum demonstrated small areas of adenosarcoma resembling elements of the previous tumor. Mullerian adenosarcoma is a rare tumor of mullerian origin, and its less aggressive behavior as compared with mixed mullerian sarcoma is warranted. The better prognostic outlook of mullerian adenosarcoma is probably related to the histologic structure, but depends in addition on the size of the tumor and the site of origin. No case of peritoneal origin of mullerian adenosarcoma has been previously reported; we discuss this unusual location.\r"

Blood hormone studies showed testosterone 430 ng/dL, FSH 118 mIU/mL, and LH 210 mIU/mL. By ultrasound examination, the cystic adnexal mass involved the right ovary. An 18-cm, 1300-g, unicameral mass with 1200 mL of clear serous fluid and with smooth inner and outer surfaces was removed from the right broad ligament. Intraoperative testosterone levels were as follows: peripheral vein 285 ng/dL, left ovarian vein 301 ng/dL, and right ovarian vein 1635 ng/dL; tumor cystic fluid was 3032 ng/dL. Peripheral vein testosterone was 15 ng/dL 3 days postoperatively. Histopathologically, the tumor was a serous cystadenoma. No evidence of stromal luteinization, hyperplasia, or inflammation was found, and other virilizing lesions were not encountered in either ovary or in other tissues. Epithelial cells constituting the tumor may have been the source of the excess testosterone in this unique case of virilizing serous cystadenoma.\r"

Hypoproliferation of red cells is the most common form of anemia in the elderly, caused more often by chronic disease or iron deficiency and less often by vitamin deficiencies or bone marrow infiltration. Anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count, seen less often in the elderly, suggests acute blood loss or hemolysis. In some patients, the cause is not obvious, and anemia is likely due to increased sensitivity of the hematopoietic system to multiple insults and decreased homeostatic reserve. Transfusions should be used judiciously in patients with symptomatic anemia who are likely to benefit from increased oxygen delivery after transfusion.\r"

The deduced protein sequence is most homologous to the murine receptor Fc gamma RII alpha, with slightly less homology to the human receptors Fc gamma RII and Fc epsilon RI. The cDNA hybridizes to a 2.2 kilobase mRNA in human leukocytes and a cloned human natural killer cell line. Fc gamma RIII is mapped to chromosome 1 by spot-blot analysis of sorted human chromosomes. Hybridization of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII probes to restriction digests of human genomic DNA separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrates physical linkage of the two genes within a maximum distance of 200 kilobases.

  ".W": "The activated platelet is a potential target for the localization of thrombi in vivo since, after stimulation and secretion of granule contents, activated platelets are concentrated at sites of blood clot formation. In this study, we used antibodies specific for a membrane protein of activated platelets to detect experimental thrombi in an animal model. PADGEM (platelet activation-dependent granule-external membrane protein), a platelet alpha-granule membrane protein, is translocated to the plasma membrane during platelet activation and granule secretion. Since PADGEM is internal in unstimulated platelets, polyclonal anti-PADGEM and monoclonal KC4 antibodies do not bind to circulating resting platelets but do interact with activated platelets. Dacron graft material incubated with radiolabeled KC4 or anti-PADGEM antibodies in the presence of thrombin-activated platelet-rich plasma bound most of the antibody. Imaging experiments with 123I-labeled anti-PADGEM in baboons with an external arterial-venous Dacron shunt revealed rapid uptake in the thrombus induced by the Dacron graft; control experiments with 123I-labeled nonimmune IgG exhibited minimal uptake. Deep venous thrombi, formed by using percutaneous balloon catheters to stop blood flow in the femoral vein of baboons, were visualized with 123I-labeled anti-PADGEM. Thrombi were discernible against blood pool background activity without subtraction techniques within 1 hr. No target enhancement was seen with 123I-labeled nonimmune IgG. 123I-labeled anti-PADGEM cleared the blood pool with an initial half-disappearance time of 6 min and did not interfere with hemostasis. These results indicate that radioimmunoscintigraphy with anti-PADGEM antibodies can visualize thrombi in baboon models and is a promising technique for clinical thrombus detection in humans.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized a Mediterranean beta-thalassemia allele containing a sequence change at codon 30 that alters both beta-globin pre-mRNA splicing and the structure of the hemoglobin product. Presumably, this G----C transversion at position -1 of intron 1 reduces severely the utilization of the normal 5' splice site since the level of the Arg----Thr mutant hemoglobin (designated hemoglobin Kairouan) found in the erythrocytes of the patient is very low (2% of total hemoglobin). Since no natural mutations of the guanine located at position -1 of the CAG/GTAAGT consensus sequence had been isolated previously, we investigated the role of this nucleotide in the constitution of an active 5' splice site by studying the splicing of the pre-mRNA in cell-free extracts. We demonstrate that correct splicing of the mutant pre-mRNA is 98% inhibited. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms of pre-mRNA maturation by revealing that the last residue of the exon plays a role at least equivalent to that of the intron residue at position +5.\r"

  ".U": "89128847\r", 
  ".W": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in several nonmalignant pathophysiological processes, including proliferative diseases of the kidney. Glomerular mesangial cells secrete a PDGF-like factor and express the PDGF A-chain and c-sis (or B-chain) mRNAs. We report here that both mRNAs are induced by serum and this effect can be mimicked by recombinant PDGF, which also markedly stimulates DNA synthesis. Other growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor type alpha, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and tumor necrosis factor type alpha (TNF-alpha) also are mitogenic for human mesangial cells and induce expression of the PDGF mRNAs. EGF, TNF-alpha, and bFGF also stimulate these cells to secrete a PDGF-like factor. Furthermore, anti-PDGF antibody partially abrogates the mitogenic effect of EGF, suggesting that mitogen-stimulated PDGF synthesis in mesangial cells is at least partly responsible for cell growth induced by other growth factors. In contrast to these results, transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta), while inducing both mRNAs, is not mitogenic, indicating that its effect on message levels can be dissociated from DNA synthesis. These data suggest that several peptide growth factors regulate the growth of mesangial cells and that PDGF may be an effector molecule that plays a role in the mitogenic response to many of these growth stimuli.\r"

  ".U": "89128848\r", 
  ".W": "The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a 97-amino acid integral membrane protein expressed at the surface of infected cells. Recent studies have shown that a monoclonal antibody (14C2) recognizes the N terminus of M2 and restricts the replication of certain influenza A viruses. To investigate the mechanism of M2 antibody growth restriction, 14C2 antibody-resistant variants of strain A/Udorn/72 have been isolated. Most of the variant viruses are not conventional antigenic variants as their M2 protein is still recognized by the 14C2 antibody. A genetic analysis of reassortant influenza viruses prepared from the 14C2 antibody-resistant variants and an antibody-sensitive parent virus indicates that M2 antibody growth restriction is linked to RNA segment 7, which encodes both the membrane protein (M1) and the M2 integral membrane protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of RNA segment 7 from the variant viruses predicts single amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of M2 at positions 71 and 78 or at the N terminus of the M1 protein at residues 31 and 41. To further examine the genetic basis for sensitivity and resistance to the 14C2 antibody, the nucleotide sequences of RNA segment 7 of several natural isolates of influenza virus have been obtained. Differences in the M1 and M2 amino acid sequences for some of the naturally resistant strains correlate with those found for the M2 antibody variant viruses. The possible interaction of M1 and M2 in virion assembly is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89128851\r", 
  ".W": "During fetal development, the regional distribution of callosal projection neurons in the rhesus monkey's postcentral gyrus changes from a uniform to a discontinuous pattern. To determine if this developmental change reflects the retraction of transient callosal projections, two different fluorescent tracers were injected into the brain of fetal monkeys of known gestational ages. Fast blue was injected into the entire postcentral gyrus of one hemisphere, whereas a second tracer (rhodamine latex beads or diamidino yellow) was injected into the caudal portion of the postcentral gyrus of the other hemisphere. The rostral portion of the postcentral gyrus (contralateral to the hemisphere injected with fast blue) was subsequently examined for the presence of labeled cells. In animals injected early in fetal development, on embryonic day 110 or younger and sacrificed 4 weeks later, there were numerous cells labeled with both tracers. In contrast, very few double-labeled cells were found in fetuses injected at an older age, embryonic day 135. We interpret these findings as showing that early in fetal development, when callosal projection neurons in the postcentral gyrus show a continuous distribution pattern, single cells in the rostral portion of this gyrus possess at least two collaterals, one projecting to the contralateral hemisphere and the other to the caudal portion of the gyrus. Subsequently, many of these neurons retract callosal collaterals while maintaining ipsilateral projections. Thus, process elimination accounts for the establishment of the discontinuous distribution of callosal neurons found in the postcentral gyrus of the mature primate.\r"

Substantial CAT-inducing activity was found in membranes from adult rat spinal cord and sensory and sympathetic ganglia. Whole brain membranes demonstrated significantly less activity. CAT induction in sympathetic neurons in response to spinal cord membranes was linear with respect to time, after an initial 6-hr lag. It was also linear with respect to concentrations of spinal cord protein from 2 to 100 micrograms per ml. CAT-inducing activity was extracted from spinal cord membranes by incubation with 100 mM NaCl and was purified approximately 5000-fold by DEAE ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The active factor appears to be an extrinsic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa. It is inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin but is moderately thermostable, retaining activity at 60 degrees C but not at 90 degrees C.\r"

All forms have the same extracellular region of more than 600 amino acid residues, a region also found in a fragment (Fr2) that can be released from cells by proteolysis. The liver cell adhesion molecule (L-CAM) is expressed as a single species that is distinct from N-CAM, but its extracellular region can also be obtained as a proteolytic fragment (Ft1). Examination of the various forms of N-CAM and the Ft1 fragment of L-CAM by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed molecules indicated that they all have rod-shaped structures that contain a hinge region which is apparently flexible. Both the ssd chain and the Fr2 fragment of N-CAM are single rods bent into arms approximately 18 and 10 nm long. The ld and sd chains are longer bent rods that form rosettes comprising two to six branches; detergent treatment disrupts these rosettes into single rods. Specific antibodies that block homophilic N-CAM binding labeled the distal ends of the branches of the ld/sd rosettes and the ends of the longer arm of both the ssd chain and the Fr2 fragment. Antibodies that bind to the sialic acid-rich region of N-CAM bound near the hinge. These data indicate that the N-CAM rosettes are formed by interaction between their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and not by interactions involving their homophilic binding sites. The L-CAM Ft1 fragment is also a bent rod with an apparently flexible hinge; like the ssd chain and the Fr2 fragment of N-CAM, it does not form aggregates. The similarities between L-CAM and N-CAM, despite their differences in amino acid sequence, suggest that their general configuration and the presence of a flexible hinge are important elements in assuring effective and specific cell-cell adhesion.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine whether microglia respond as a group and move en masse or instead move individually, at different rates, and whether they move along axons directly to the lesion or take another route, such as along the edges of the nerve cord. Cell nuclei in living nerve cords were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye and observed under dim ultraviolet illumination using fluorescence optics, a low-light video camera, and computer-assisted signal enhancement. Muscular movements of the cord were selectively reduced by bathing in 23 mM MgCl2. Regions of nerve cord within 300 microns of the crush were observed for 2-6 hr. Only a fraction of microglia, typically less than 50%, moved at any time, traveling toward the lesion at speeds up to 7 microns/min. Cells were moving as soon as observation began, within 15 min of crushing, and traveled directly toward the lesion along axons or axon tracts. Movements and roles of leech microglia are compared with their vertebrate counterparts, which are also active and respond to nerve injury.\r"

By analysis of chicken ALAS cDNA clones isolated from both liver and erythroid cells, we show that at least two separate genes encode ALAS mRNAs. These experiments show that (i) two different genes encode the ALAS isozymes found in erythroid and in liver tissues, and (ii) while the product of the erythroid gene (ALASE) is expressed exclusively in erythroid cells, the hepatic form of the enzyme is expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that this is the nonspecific form (ALASN) found in all chicken tissues.\r"

KGF was both acid and heat labile and consisted of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 28 kDa. Purified KGF was a potent mitogen for epithelial cells, capable of stimulating DNA synthesis in quiescent BALB/MK epidermal keratinocytes by greater than 500-fold with activity detectable at 0.1 nM and maximal at 1.0 nM. Lack of mitogenic activity on either fibroblasts or endothelial cells indicated that KGF possessed a target cell specificity distinct from any previously characterized growth factor. Microsequencing revealed an amino-terminal sequence containing no significant homology to any known protein. The release of this growth factor by human embryonic fibroblasts raises the possibility that KGF may play a role in mesenchymal stimulation of normal epithelial cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory burst oxidase of neutrophils can be activated in a cell-free system in which plasma membranes, cytosol, Mg2+, and a membrane-perturbing detergent, such as arachidonate or sodium dodecyl sulfate, are all required. Using the technique of preparative isoelectric focusing, the cytosol factor required for oxidase activation was resolved into four components termed C1-C4 with respective pI values of approximately 3.1, 6.0, 7.0, and 9.5. Individually, these components were incapable of activating the oxidase and could only be detected in the presence of suboptimal amounts of normal cytosol that served to supply at least a limited amount of each of the required components. Attempts to activate the oxidase with a combination of the four components failed, suggesting that there might be a yet undetected fifth cytosolic component. Patients with autosomal recessive cytochrome b-positive chronic granulomatous disease (type II CGD) are severely deficient in cytosol factor activity. When added to cytosol samples from two patients with this form of CGD, component C4 restored the ability of each patient's cytosol to activate dormant oxidase. None of the other three cytosol factor components (C1-C3) was effective in this regard, a finding supported by the direct demonstration that these three components were present in normal amounts in this type of CGD. A different form of type II CGD was identified in a third patient on the basis of complementation studies in which the patient's cytosol was able to activate the oxidase in the cell-free system when mixed with cytosol from one of the first two patients. The defect in this third patient's cytosol could be partially corrected by component C2, but not component C4, obtained from normal cytosol. These findings indicate that the role of cytosol in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase is more complex than previously appreciated in that at least four cytosolic components appear to be required. Defects in two of these components have now been identified and appear to be responsible for two biochemically distinct forms of CGD.\r"

(1988) Science 241, 84-86] was used to identify specific nuclear binding of a tritiated synthetic androgen, [3H]R1881 (methyltrienolone), in 21 of 25 (84%) human osteoblast-like cell strains and a concentration of bound steroid receptors of 821 +/- 140 (mean +/- SEM) molecules per cell nucleus. Binding was saturable and steroid-specific. Androgen receptor gene expression in osteoblasts was confirmed by RNA blot analysis. Relative concentrations of androgen and estrogen receptors were compared by measuring specific nuclear estrogen binding. Nuclear binding of [3H]estradiol was observed in 27 of 30 (90%) cell strains; the concentration of bound estradiol receptor was 1537 +/- 221 molecules per cell nucleus. The concentrations of nuclear binding sites were similar in males and females for both [3H]R1881 and [3H]estradiol. We conclude that both androgens and estrogens act directly on human bone cells through their respective receptor-mediated mechanisms.\r"

Using the gel mobility assay, we examined the binding mechanism of purified estrogen receptor to the ERE contained on a 255-base-pair fragment from the upstream region between nucleotides -1784 to -1531 of the rat prolactin gene. Remarkably, specific high-affinity binding was detected to the dissociated \"coding strand\" but not to the \"noncoding strand\" of the ERE-containing fragment. The dissociated strands of this fragment possess unusual secondary structure, as indicated by their anomalous migration in the gel mobility assay. The estrogen receptor binds to the coding strand of the ERE with a 60-fold higher affinity than to the double-stranded ERE. Furthermore, the receptor binds with a 1000-fold greater affinity to the coding strand of the ERE than to a double-stranded nonspecific DNA fragment. We propose that, in vivo, the estrogen receptor initially binds to the double-stranded ERE. Subsequently, the DNA strands separate due to transitory strand separation and supercoiling, allowing folding of the coding strand of the ERE into a structure that is then bound more tightly by the receptor. The formation of this receptor-ERE coding strand complex may be a crucial step in the mechanism of estrogen-stimulated transcription.\r"

  ".W": "RecBCD enzyme (exonuclease V) of Escherichia coli unwinds DNA, frequently forming asymmetric structures with two single-stranded tails of unequal length abutting a single-stranded loop at the junction with double-stranded DNA. Their lengths are consistent with the longer tail being one strand of the duplex and the loop plus the shorter tail being the other strand. The strand polarity of the unwinding was determined by labeling the 3' or 5' ends of duplex DNA with biotinylated nucleotides, reacting the DNA with RecBCD enzyme, and distinguishing the labeled ends, in the electron microscope, by their binding to streptavidin-gold complex. The shorter tail was formed from the DNA strand with its 3' terminus at the duplex end where RecBCD enzyme entered. We conclude that RecBCD enzyme unwinds DNA by forming a loop on the strand with a 3' end at the entry point. This result is concordant with a previously proposed model of recombination, which we discuss.\r"

The antifreezes inhibit growth on the prism faces but allow limited growth on the basal plane. As new layers are deposited on the basal plane, pyramidal surfaces develop on the outside of the crystal, and large hexagonal pits form within the basal plane. The pits are rotated 30 degrees with respect to the normal orientation of hexagonal ice crystals. Growth inhibition on the prism, pyramidal, and pit faces indicates that these faces contain sites of adsorption of the antifreeze molecules. Several properties of the antifreeze pits are consistent with (but do not prove) an origin of the pits at dislocations. The similarity of crystal habit imposed on ice by antifreezes with wide differences in composition and structure indicates a common mechanism.\r"

Transport was assayed in a reconstituted system using isolated pea chloroplasts and radioactively labeled precursor. Binding to the chloroplast envelope was assayed in a similar manner using chloroplasts pretreated with nigericin. Most mutants showed a dramatically decreased capacity of binding, although some of them transported relatively well. The accumulation of the mutant proteins inside the chloroplast as a function of time was examined. Although the authentic small subunit precursor was imported rapidly, uptake of most mutant precursors was considerably slower and continued until the last time point examined. In terms of assigning functions to individual regions, we found that at least the middle region and parts of the amino and the carboxyl termini of the transit peptide are more important for receptor binding than for translocation. A two-step processing mechanism has been postulated for the maturation of the small subunit precursor. This model predicts the occurrence of processing intermediates. When precursors carrying carboxyl-terminal deletions were presented to the chloroplast, no defined intermediates could be detected. Instead, a number of proteins, probably resulting from aberrant processing, accumulated simultaneously inside the chloroplasts.\r"

  ".W": "Structurally distinguishable mutants of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were used to investigate the mechanism of EGFR autophosphorylation. Mutant receptors generated by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed in transfected NIH 3T3 cells lacking endogenous receptors. After coincubation of cell lysates in the presence or absence of EGF, receptor immunoprecipitates were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. A kinase-negative mutant EGFR (K721A), in which Lys-721 in the ATp binding site was replaced by an alanine residue, was shown to be phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner by an enzymatically active EGFR deletion mutant lacking two autophosphorylation sites. A mutant EGFR lacking the EGF-binding domain as well as the phosphorylation sites also phosphorylated the kinase-negative mutant. In both cases the kinase-negative mutant K721A was phosphorylated on sites virtually identical to the sites that are autophosphorylated by wild-type recombinant or native human EGFRs. With four different site-specific anti-EGFR antibodies, it was shown that deletion mutants devoid of epitopes recognized by the antibodies were coimmunoprecipitated together with wild-type or mutant receptors recognized by the antibodies. This indicates that EGFR oligomers were preserved during immunoprecipitation. On the basis of these results, we propose that autophosphorylation of solubilized EGFR is mediated by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, probably facilitated by receptor oligomerization.\r"

Dephosphorylation does not occur in exocytosis-incompetent cells. Polyclonal antibodies against purified parafusin have now been used to show that this protein is present in unicellular organisms and cells of metazoan groups of wide evolutionary divergence, such as yeast, insects, and mammals, including humans. These results suggest that parafusin was present early in the history of eukaryotes and that it is of functional importance in the general mechanism of exocytosis and membrane fusion.\r"

Certain highly porous, crosslinked collagen-glycosaminoglycan copolymers have induced partial morphogenesis of skin when seeded with dermal and epidermal cells and then grafted on standard, full-thickness skin wounds in the adult guinea pig. A mature epidermis and a nearly physiological dermis, which lacked hair follicles but was demonstrably different from scar, were regenerated over areas as large as 16 cm2. These chemical analogs of extracellular matrices were morphogenetically active provided that the average pore diameter ranged between 20 and 125 microns, the resistance to degradation by collagenase exceeded a critical limit, and the density of autologous dermal and epidermal cells inoculated therein was greater than 5 x 10(4) cells per cm2 of wound area. Unseeded copolymers with physical structures that were within these limits delayed the onset of wound contraction by about 10 days but did not eventually prevent it. Seeded copolymers not only delayed contraction but eventually arrested and reversed it while new skin was being regenerated. The data identify a model extracellular matrix that acts as if it were an insoluble growth factor with narrowly specified physiochemical structure, functioning as a transient basal lamina during morphogenesis of skin.\r"

Primary LPL deficiency is a genetic disorder that is usually manifested by a severe elevation in triacylglycerol levels. We have used a recently isolated LPL cDNA clone to study 15 probands from 11 families with this inherited disorder. Surprisingly, 7 of the probands from 4 families, of different ancestries, had a similar insertion in their LPL gene. In contrast to other human genetic disorders, where insertions are rare causes of mutation, this insertion accounts for a significant proportion of the alleles causing LPL deficiency. Detailed restriction mapping of the insertion revealed that it was unlikely to be a duplication of neighboring DNA and that it was not similar to the consensus sequence of human L1 repetitive elements. This suggests that there must be other mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis in human genetic disease besides transposition of mobile L1 repetitive elements.\r"

The mutation in nucleotide 209, which changes codon 70 from GAT to GGT, was found by sequencing a genomic clone and sequencing selected regions of DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The entire coding sequences for usual and atypical cholinesterases were compared, and no other consistent base differences were found. A polymorphic site near the C terminus of the coded region was detected, but neither allele at this locus segregated consistently with the atypical trait. The nucleotide-209 mutation was detected in all five atypical cholinesterase families examined. There was complete concordance between this mutation and serum cholinesterase phenotypes for all 14 heterozygous and 6 homozygous atypical subjects tested. The mutation causes the loss of a Sau3A1 restriction site; the resulting DNA fragment length polymorphism was verified by electrophoresis of 32P-labeled DNA restriction fragments from usual and atypical subjects. Dot-blot hybridization analysis with a 19-mer allele-specific probe to the DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction distinguished between the usual and atypical genotypes. We conclude that the Asp-70----Gly mutation (acidic to neutral amino acid substitution) accounts for reduced affinity of atypical cholinesterase for choline esters and that Asp-70 must be an important component of the anionic site. Heterogeneity in atypical alleles may exist, but the Asp-70 point mutation may represent an appreciable portion of the atypical gene pool.\r"

Two alleles of the b locus of U. maydis were isolated by complementation and hybridization. The clones have the specificities of b1 and b2 alleles as demonstrated by their effects on the colony morphology and pathogenicity of haploid and diploid strains upon transformation. For example, nonpathogenic haploid and diploid strains of U. maydis carrying b2 alleles became pathogenic when transformed with the cloned b1 allele. Furthermore, an a2 b2 haploid strain could be transformed to an a2 b1 genotype by gene replacement using a DNA fragment containing a b1 allele and a selectable marker. The isolation of b alleles represents an important step toward understanding the control of dicaryon formation, dicaryon maintenance, and pathogenicity in U. maydis.\r"

One hundred and thirteen individuals (84.3%) had a normal arrangement of their color vision pigment genes. All had one red pigment gene; the number of green pigment genes ranged from one to five with a mode of two. The frequency of molecular genotypes indicative of normal color vision (84.3%) was significantly lower than had been observed in previous studies of color vision phenotypes. Color vision defects can be due to deletions of red or green pigment genes or due to formation of hybrid genes comprising portions of both red and green pigment genes [Nathans, J., Piantanida, T.P., Eddy, R.L., Shows, T.B., Jr., & Hogness, D.S. (1986) Science 232, 203-210]. Characteristic anomalous patterns were seen in 15 (11.2%) individuals: 7 (5.2%) had patterns characteristic of deuteranomaly (mild defect in green color perception), 2 (1.5%) had patterns characteristic of deuteranopia (severe defect in green color perception), and 6 (4.5%) had protan patterns (the red perception defects protanomaly and protanopia cannot be differentiated by current molecular methods). Previously undescribed hybrid gene patterns consisting of both green and red pigment gene fragments in addition to normal red and green genes were observed in another 6 individuals (4.5%). Only 2 of these patterns were considered as deuteranomalous. Thus, DNA testing detected anomalous color vision pigment genes at a higher frequency than expected from phenotypic color vision tests. Some color vision gene arrays associated with hybrid genes are likely to mediate normal color vision.\r"

When 305-day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent milk production records for the current lactation were adjusted for genetic potential, bovine leukemia virus-infected cows that were hematologically normal had significantly greater milk production than did seronegative herdmates, suggesting that early bovine leukemia virus infection was positively associated with milk yield. Genetic potential for fat production was significantly greater for cows with persistent lymphocytosis (21 +/- 2 kg) than for other seropositive (16 +/- 1 kg) and seronegative herdmates (13 +/- 2 kg); however, 305-day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent fat production for the current lactation was not significantly different between the groups. Thus, cows with persistent lymphocytosis did not produce fat according to their genetic potential. As an apparent consequence of tendencies for greater milk yield and less fat production, milk fat percentage was significantly reduced in cows with persistent lymphocytosis (3.33 +/- 0.09%) and other seropositive cows (3.48 +/- 0.05%) relative to seronegative herdmates (3.67 +/- 0.07%). These results suggest a need to reevaluate the economic impact of bovine leukemia virus infection on the dairy industry.\r"

The bolus contrast-enhanced dynamic scan technique is reproducible and of value in patients undergoing sequential CT for assessment of tumor bulk response to chemotherapy. Patients who are potential candidates for resection of focal hepatic lesions should preoperatively undergo intraarterial contrast-enhanced CT. Intravenous bolus enhanced dynamic hepatic CT can be extended to cover more than one anatomic region (eg, abdomen and thorax), as in patients undergoing CT for staging lung carcinoma. In these patients, incremental scan sequences are programmed caudad to cephalad.

Distribution of pulmonary parenchymal disease was classified as centrilobular, panlobular, perilobular, bronchovascular, or nonlobular. Intralobular classification of disease distribution was more feasible in less severely diseased regions. HRCT revealed thickened intralobular bronchovascular bundles in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans, mycoplasma pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis and thickening of both bronchovascular bundles and perilobular structures in patients with sarcoidosis, lymphangitis carcinomatosa, and malignant lymphoma. Centrilobular areas of increased attenuation were seen in patients with bronchopneumonia and pulmonary cryptococcosis.

The improved clarity and sharpness of parenchymal abnormalities on HRCT images, even in severely involved areas, provide additional information about disease distribution.\r"

Prospective, independent, and blinded interpretations of the studies were compared with both the surgical findings (15 patients) and the patient's clinical symptoms (17 patients). Thin-section (5-mm) coronal and sagittal MR images proved more accurate than CT scans (.94 accuracy with MR imaging, .63 with CT) in evaluation of tumor invasion through the superior sulcus. The improved accuracy of MR imaging in this region appears almost certainly to be related to the improved display of the anatomy of the superior sulcus on thin-section coronal and sagittal images.\r"

To evaluate the utility of CT, the authors studied 35 patients with clinical stage T1N0M0 lung cancer who underwent CT. Thoracotomy, mediastinoscopy, or fine-needle aspiration biopsy were performed in 26 of the patients. Metastases were proved in six of these patients, with CT demonstrating adenopathy in four of the six and a contralateral mass in one. Chest wall invasion was not demonstrated with CT in one patient. The overall prevalence of metastatic lesions in this group of 26 patients was 23.1%, with 15.4% of the 26 having unresectable lesions. CT demonstrated all metastatic lesions that precluded curative surgery. The results suggest that CT is clinically useful in the evaluation of clinical stage T1N0M0 lung cancer.\r"

Appearance of the minor fissure on CT scans can be categorized into two major configurations, which are determined by variation in contour of the middle lobe upper surface. The location of the highest point along this surface is either medial (type I configuration) or lateral (type II configuration). The lowest tributary of the vein draining the anterior segment of the upper lobe was seen in 75% of the patients. This vessel was a reliable landmark in delineating boundaries between upper and middle lobes, even when the fissure was radiologically incomplete or absent. In the authors' experience, familiarity with these configurations of the minor fissure has been useful in localization of a lesion in a lobe or determination of its possible extension beyond the fissure into the neighboring lobe.\r"

Among the 79 nodules that were less attenuating than the reference phantom, 26 were malignant, 22 were benign, and 31 were followed up for up to 4.5 years with no evidence of malignancy.

At 18 hours and, increasingly, at 42 hours, radiographic evidence of HAPE developed in eight subjects: six with previously documented HAPE and two without. Radiographic signs of HAPE were most severe peripherally, and morphologic characteristics were compatible with permeability and/or overperfusion edema and normal pulmonary venous pressure. Extensive radiographic findings were accompanied by discrete pulmonary rales, and chest radiography proved valuable in detecting HAPE in subjects with normal findings of lung auscultation. This study demonstrates a significant individual susceptibility of lowland residents with a history of HAPE to develop HAPE, resulting in a recurrence rate of 66%.\r"

Intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid dimeglumine (50% of the dose used in spin-echo sequences) aided in detection of carcinomas as small as 3 mm in dense breast tissue. In 25 patients, dynamic studies were performed at short intervals after the injection of contrast medium in an attempt to differentiate more reliably between breast tissue types. All six malignant tumors found in these 25 patients showed enhancement characterized by a sudden increase in signal intensity on the order of 100% within the first 2 minutes after injection and a much slighter increase thereafter. Sixteen benign lesions showed a substantially different pattern of enhancement. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.\r"

Fast MR imaging techniques, either gradient-echo or spin-echo, can be used to document the passage of Gd-DTPA through the renal tubules, as reflected by alteration in the MR signal intensity within the different anatomic regions of the kidney. Gradient-echo (repetition time of 35 msec, echo time of 7 msec, flip angles of 10 degrees-100 degrees) and spin-echo (repetition time of 35 msec, echo time of 8 msec) pulse sequences were used to acquire 20 consecutive images, one every 12 seconds, of the rabbit kidney. Both pulse sequences depicted the time course of Gd-DTPA distribution through the kidney but with distinctly different patterns of MR signal change. These dynamic MR images provide an MR nephrogram that directly demonstrates renal morphology and indirectly reflects the functional status of the renal vasculature, renal perfusion, and tubular concentrating ability.\r"

Several rabbits were also imaged in dehydrated (five animals) and overhydrated (seven animals) states. A reproducible renal enhancement pattern is observed that can be divided into three phases. During the first phase, a peripheral dark band appears, probably representing arrival of Gd-DTPA within the arterioles and vasa recta. The second phase begins as a second dark band migrating centripetally toward the medulla; this likely represents the concentration of Gd-DTPA in the descending limb of the loop of Henle. The third phase is characterized by a gradual darkening in the papilla, probably caused by concentration of Gd-DTPA within the collecting ducts. Hydration status influences the duration of these phases. These observations can be explained by the anatomy and physiologic characteristics of the nephron, as well as the MR characteristics of Gd-DTPA at different concentrations.\r"

A kit formulation for Tc-99m MAG3 has been developed and compared with I-131 OIH in 17 patients with suspected renal dysfunction and three potential kidney donors. There were no adverse reactions. Tc-99m MAG3 images were of good quality and consistently better than I-131 OIH images. There was no significant difference in the relative renal uptake of Tc-99m MAG3 and I-131 OIH. The 30-minute urinary excretion of Tc-99m MAG3 was 36.4%, versus 40.4% for I-131 OIH. The average plasma clearance of Tc-99m MAG3 (138 mL/min +/- 117) was less than that of I-131 OIH (272 mL/min +/- 205) (P less than .001); however, there was good correlation between the Tc-99m MAG3 and I-131 OIH clearances (r = .87). The volume of distribution of Tc-99m MAG3 (5.96 L +/- 1.94) was less than that of I-131 OIH (9.41 L +/- 3.73) (P less than .001). These characteristics and the advantages of a simple kit formulation should lead to widespread clinical use.\r"

Criteria were defined and used to group adverse reactions into three classes of clinical severity. Overall, class I (mild), class II (moderate), and class III (severe) reactions occurred in 362 (45%), 44 (5.5%), and three (0.4%) patients, respectively. Class II reactions were relatively common (25%) in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization yet were uncommon (2%) in patients undergoing the other three procedures. Nephrotoxicity occurred in 18 of 651 patients who had follow-up creatinine levels obtained at 48-72 hours. With multivariate regression analysis, the only risk factor (P less than .05) for combined class II and III reactions was diabetes. Diabetes, furosemide use, and a history of atopy (odds ratio = 2.8) were associated with nephrotoxicity (P less than .05). Underlying renal insufficiency was not a risk factor for nephrotoxicity.\r"

Stents in healthy aortic tissue led to stent intimalization, previously reported in canine studies. For stents placed in animals subjected to a high-cholesterol diet but no intimal trauma, it was found that the stent was not the source of atherogenesis. Stents placed in atheromatous plaque were found to radially compress plaque with time and to stimulate for formation of a fibrotic crust.

Doxorubicin, 40-100 mg (mean, 61.3 mg), was mixed with 5-20 mL (mean, 9.6 mL) of an iodized oil to prepare a water-in-oil emulsion that was then infused into the hepatic artery. Both progressive changes in blood concentrations of doxorubicin and its tissue concentrations in patients who underwent hepatectomy demonstrated that the drug was released slowly from the emulsion. The cumulative survival rate was 82.0% for 6 months, 53.8% for 1 year, 33.3% for 2 years, and 17.6% for 3 years. These survival rates were better than those of 104 patients who underwent embolization with gelatin sponge, then received an anticancer drug (67.4% for 6 months, 45.2% for 1 year, 16.3% for 2 years, and 3.8% for 3 years).\r"

Abnormal patterns of hepatic parenchymal contrast medium enhancement in 25 patients with advanced congestive heart failure who were studied with computed tomography (CT) include a lobulated, patchy, inhomogeneous pattern in all 25 patients, an irregular perivascular enhancement in 14, and a global delay in parenchymal enhancement in nine. CT examinations showed cardiomegaly in the 20 patients with cardiac failure and pericardial effusion or thickening in the five patients with pericardial disease. Also noted were distention of the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 24 patients, hepatomegaly in 23, early reflux of contrast medium into the IVC in 21 and hepatic veins in 16, and hepatic perivascular lymph-edema in six. The abnormal patterns are thought to be due to slowing of hepatic blood flow. Confusion with Budd-Chiari syndrome and other forms of multifocal hepatic disease is avoidable with clinical and radiologic correlation.\r"

The procedures included a spin-echo (SE) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 250 or 125 msec and an echo time (TE) of 15 msec (TR/TE = 250 or 125/15) and gradient-echo (GRE) partial-flip sequences at 250 or 125/20 in phase and 250 or 125/12 out of phase (flip angle of 70 degrees). These procedures were compared with conventional multiacquisition sequences at SE 250/15 (n = 8) in the same patients. GRE partial-flip sequences with a large flip angle provided the optimum combination of contrast and signal-to-noise ratio for imaging hepatic neoplasms, with a signal-difference-to-noise ratio that for in-phase images was 93% greater and for out-of-phase images was 53% greater than that of the SE images. The use of in-phase TEs was preferable to maintain tissue contrast, and presaturation pulses were employed to eliminate vascular pulsation artifacts. All breath-hold procedures provided suppression of motion artifacts superior to that of the short TR, short TE multiacquisition SE imaging. Such sequences should become indispensable for MR imaging of the upper abdomen.\r"

The authors correlated the radiographic and manometric findings in 17 patients with DES to better clarify the role of radiography in the evaluation of this uncommon motility disorder. Incomplete or absent primary peristalsis was observed on radiographs in 13 patients (76%), and mild to severe tertiary activity was seen in 12 patients (71%). The mean estimated thickness of the esophageal wall in patients with DES was 2.6 mm compared with 2.5 mm in an age-matched control group of 17 patients with normal esophageal manometric findings (P greater than .05). The authors conclude that most patients with DES show abnormal esophageal motility on radiographs, although the findings were nonspecific and required clinical and manometric correlation. Esophageal wall thickness was normal in patients with DES and appears to be an overemphasized sign in differentiating DES from other esophageal motility disorders.\r"

In all six cases, endoscopy revealed a normal rectum or mild, nonspecific proctosigmoiditis without evidence of pseudomembranes in the rectosigmoid colon. Four patients had an atypical clinical presentation with bloody diarrhea (three cases) or minimal mucous diarrhea (one case). Thus, the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis may initially be suggested on barium studies in patients who have relative sparing of the rectosigmoid colon with characteristic findings more proximally in the colon.\r"

Intravertebral fat content could not be predicted on the basis of somatic fat, weight, or bone mineral content. Intravertebral fat content was elevated in patients with anorexia nervosa (compared with normal values in young female volunteers). In patients with anorexia, the amount of fat increase was disproportionately large for the severity of osteopenia. In patients with Cushing syndrome, the intravertebral fat content did not differ from that in the volunteers. Intravertebral fat does not correlate well with bone mineral content within any group and appears to be related to other factors.\r"

Preoperative determination of tumor response has therapeutic implications, and angiography offers a less subjective means of assessing it than do conventional radiography or computed tomography. Changes in tumor vascularity, as seen angiographically, after two courses and at the time of the last of several courses of preoperative chemotherapy were correlated with histologic tumor necrosis of resected specimens in 81 patients. Angiographically, 40% of the histologic responders and 91% of the nonresponders were identified after two courses of preoperative chemotherapy. After a median of four courses of chemotherapy, 91% of the responders but only 50% of the nonresponders were identified angiographically. Angiographic assessment of tumor vascularity, although not of absolute value, offers a useful guideline for determining the preoperative chemotherapy strategy.\r"

In the extradural space, lesions often showed mild increase of enhancement on delayed images, but enhancement was always visible on immediate postcontrast images. In the intradural extramedullary space, tumor nodules demonstrated most prominent enhancement on early images, although subtle, strandlike enhancement of the nerve roots showed some delayed uptake of contrast medium on later images. In the intramedullary space, enhancement often increased on delayed images, although this increase was usually mild. For clinical purposes, immediate postcontrast imaging should be sufficient to depict the majority of spinal lesions, regardless of location. However, selected cases, such as necrotic spinal cord tumors, will require delayed imaging.\r"

T1-weighted images were not particularly useful in discriminating pathologic subtype, because most tumors were isointense with or hypointense to cortex regardless of histologic type. Signal intensity and features on T2-weighted images strongly correlated with histopathologic findings in over 75% of cases, however. Meningiomas markedly hypointense to cortex on T2-weighted images (seven of 40 cases) were composed predominantly of fibroblastic or transitional elements, while markedly hyperintense meningiomas (14 of 40 cases) demonstrated predominance of syncytial or angioblastic elements. Consideration of secondary features visible at MR imaging (degree of edema, cyst formation, presence of calcium aggregates) led to a more specific histologic prediction in over half of the remaining isointense tumors. The varied MR appearance of meningiomas has a clear histologic basis, and crude prediction of pathologic subtype is possible in over three-fourths of cases.\r"

T1 values of IWMLs were significantly greater than those of normal white matter in all patients studied, and T2 values of IWMLs were significantly greater in 20 of 21 patients. N[H] values of IWMLs were greater in 20 of 21 patients, with statistically significant differences from those of normal white matter in 17 of those 20 patients. Averaged over all 21 patients studied, N[H] values of IWMLs were 20% higher than N[H] values of normal white matter. The effect of unequal N[H] values on contrast between IWMLs and normal tissues is to reduce contrast on short SE sequences with a short repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE), while enhancing contrast between IWMLs and normal tissues on long TR/TE SE sequences. Elevated N[H] values in IWMLs have a minimal effect on contrast in conventional inversion-recovery (IR) sequences but substantially enhance contrast between IWMLs and normal brain tissues in short inversion time IR sequences.\r"

In 17 cases, the MR examinations showed both subependymal nodules and multiple peripheral gyral lesions consistent with cortical tubers. Cortical tubers were more frequently demonstrated on spin-echo images obtained with a long repetition time (TR). Because the signal abnormality was located predominantly in the subcortical portion of the tubers, the terms \"gyral core\" and \"sulcal island\" were used to describe the patterns noted at MR imaging. Subependymal nodules were best seen on inversion-recovery or short TR spin-echo images, although hypointensity within the nodules consistent with calcification was present in 14 patients and was most evident on long TR spin-echo images. Computed tomographic (CT) scans that had been obtained within 3 years of MR images were available for 13 patients. Intracranial calcification was more accurately diagnosed with CT. However, MR imaging is more sensitive than CT in the detection of gyral tubers and, thus, may be better for screening family members and others in whom tuberous sclerosis is a possibility.\r"

Thirty-four of the neoplasms had normal to slightly alkaline pH before irradiation. During fractionated radiation therapy, the pH stayed in a range of from near neutral to alkaline and rose to 7.6-8.0 at several time points of radiation therapy for some tumors. These results suggest that most tumor cells in human neoplasms are well oxygenated and that only a negligible fraction are chronic hypoxic cells. The fluctuating alkaline pH during radiation therapy occurred regardless of the responsiveness of the treated tumors.\r"

Radiologists have a dominant role in obstetric US, percutaneous inferior vena cava filter placement, and urethrography, although there is significant participation by nonradiologists in these studies. Radiologists and nonradiologists have roughly equivalent roles in vascular US and hysterosalpingography. Nonradiologists have the dominant roles in percutaneous gastrostomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, kidney stone lithotripsy, coronary angiography and angioplasty, pediatric angiocardiography, and echocardiography.\r"

Sixty Hickman catheters were placed percutaneously in an interventional radiology suite in 51 consecutive patients. Complications included one case of pneumothorax and pulmonary artery air embolism (1.7%); one case of brachiocephalic vein thrombosis (1.7%); one case of arterial puncture in a patient with a coagulopathy causing mediastinal hemorrhage, sepsis, and eventual death (1.7%); four cases of catheter sepsis (6.7%); and three cases of suspected local infection or inflammation (5.0%). These rates are comparable to those in surgical series. Radiologic methods increased the convenience, decreased the time and cost of insertion, and enabled superior fluoroscopic control. Modern angiographic materials provide improved safety during access to the subclavian vein. The authors conclude that radiologic Hickman catheter placement offers significant advantages over traditional surgical placement.\r"

In two plantar arch fistulas, the technique was further enhanced by manual compression of arterial inflow to decrease the rate of blood flow through the fistula. All five AVFs were successfully occluded. The authors conclude that AVFs and AVMs can be distinguished by means of the appropriate angiographic techniques.\r"

Laser-assisted angioplasty was the initial intervention in eight of the 13 superficial femoral artery occlusions. In two cases, a wire had been first advanced across the lesion, and in three cases, attempts to cross the lesion with a wire had been unsuccessful. The availability of the laser did not significantly increase the number of cases amenable to angioplasty, and at present laser angioplasty, does not seem to be cost-effective for community hospitals.\r"

Aortic aneurysms were experimentally created in six dogs and subsequently bridged with nylon-covered, self-expanding metallic stents. The dogs were followed up for as long as 7 months (median, 22 weeks). In each dog, the graft effectively reconstituted the aortic lumen, excluding the aneurysm. One dog exhibited minimal (less than 1-mm) residual dilatation at the site of the aneurysm 7 months after graft placement. The nylon material acted as a support and template for neointimal encasement, enabling the formation of a new vascular lumen. It also remained porous at the origin of aortic side branches, preserving the visceral blood supply. One of the endovascular grafts failed to expand completely at its distal end, which promoted thrombus formation within the graft and resulted in the occlusion of both renal arteries. The dog was found comatose 48 hours after graft placement and was killed at that time.\r"

In six experimental animals not killed immediately after the procedure, postoperative ureteral manometric studies and nephrostography were performed and nephrostomy drainage was maintained until death (1-8 weeks). Treatment with 200-400 J produced safe, reliable occlusion by 4 weeks. At histopathologic study at 4 and 8 weeks, necrotic muscularis propria had been replaced by fibrous tissue.

When comparing nonpulsed versus pulsed infusion techniques, the authors found that the pulsatile infusion system did not significantly improve the inhomogeneity of dye distribution in the 16 hepatic arterial branches. The results of this in vitro study suggest that a pulsatile infusion system that uses low pulse velocities without regard for cardiac cycle is less than optimal and does not significantly improve drug mixing at the standard slow infusion rates. Moreover, as potential new intraarterial delivery systems are developed to improve drug mixing, in vitro models may be the most useful means of initially evaluating their efficacy.\r"

Placement was not possible in two patients. No femoral or axillary arterial occlusions occurred as a result of these procedures. The balloon can be inflated up to 8 mm in diameter, passes readily through a 4-F introducer sheath, and can be retrieved, without detachment from the catheter, through the same sheath. A hemostatic side-arm adapter attached to the catheter permits angiography to be performed before balloon detachment.

The median proportion of time spent in the performance of vascular and interventional radiology was 10%, and 51.5% of the radiologists surveyed were in groups that included a fellowship-trained interventional radiologist. More than half (54.4%) of the radiologists indicated that nonradiologists have expressed interest in performing vascular and interventional techniques. According to 13.4% of the radiologists surveyed, cardiologists performed at least some peripheral angiography or angioplasty. The vast majority of radiologists (96.8%) did not want other specialties to assume vascular and interventional radiology procedures, but 16.8% believed these procedures will eventually be lost to other specialties. The results indicate that vascular and interventional radiology is being infringed on to a relatively large degree by other specialties.\r"

Moreover, the interventionalist must attempt to change long-standing concepts and referral patterns with aggressive dissemination of information. He or she must be an advocate of the procedures offered, as well as their benefits to the patient and the health care system. One must actively include outpatient visits and admissions as part of services offered. Allies in this effort include primary care physicians, internists, hospital administration, and third-party payers. In addition, organized radiology can now offer some assistance through the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology and the American College of Radiology. All of these factors will contribute significantly to the success of interventional radiology in both teaching and community hospital settings.\r"

Cholangiograms were obtained at 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 weeks, depending on length of follow-up. All bile duct segments containing stents remained patent throughout the follow-up periods. Characteristic luminal narrowings due to hyperplastic papillary mucosa occurred with all three stent types. although no difference could be found in the degree of narrowing of the most restrictive segment among the three stent types, mucosal proliferation was most extensive with the uncoated stent. Lack of concretion buildup and benign tissue response encourage the development of a clinically useful expandable biliary endoprosthesis.\r"

Complex malignant obstructions involving multiple systems were successfully treated with stainless steel stents in order to reconstruct the biliary tree. Stents have been in place for more than 6 months in 20 of the 31 patients; occlusions have occurred in 10% of the 31 patients. Patients with benign postoperative strictures have done very well, with one patient free of symptoms at 14 months. The initial results are encouraging.

The authors describe a multidisciplinary approach to complex endoscopic procedures in which the interventional radiologist controls catheter and guide wire placement. Of 344 procedures attempted over a 3-year period, 304 were accomplished with transendoscopic- or fluoroscopic-guided methods alone. Combined transhepatic procedures were performed in the other 40 cases. The success rate of endoscopic procedures and the number of conditions treatable with nonoperative interventional methods are increased with a multidisciplinary approach.\r"

Review of case report forms for 2,666 cases of acute typhoid fever that occurred between 1975 and 1984 showed that 62% were imported, in contrast to only 33% during 1967-1972. The proportion of cases imported has continued to rise, reaching 69% in 1984. The major sources of the 1975-1984 cases were Mexico (39%) and India (14%). The case-fatality rate was 1.3%. Antimicrobial resistance was a minor problem, and large outbreaks were unusual. Further decline in the incidence of typhoid fever in the United States probably must await the advent of an effective vaccine with minimal adverse effects for use by travelers.\r"

Candida albicans was the offending organism in four patients, Candida parapsilosis in three, Candida tropicalis in two, and Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata in one. None of the 10 patients had evidence of disseminated candidiasis, and, except for the uniform presence of a prosthesis, other underlying factors that are generally associated with candidal infections were present in only three. Clinical features that distinguished periprosthetic from natural bone and joint infection included an older patient population, the usual lack of predisposing factors other than the prosthesis, and the absence of evidence of disseminated candidiasis. All patients were treated with removal of the prosthesis and antifungal therapy, consisting of amphotericin B alone (six patients) or combined with 5-fluorocytosine (three patients) or ketoconazole (one patient). Infection appeared to be cured in nine of the 10 patients, but the follow-up was less than 1 year in five cases. Replacement with a new prosthetic joint was attempted in only two cases and successful in only one. Direct inoculation of organisms during surgery or transient unrecognized candidemia may initiate periprosthetic infection, which might then be promoted by favorable local factors, both mechanical and molecular. The role of prosthetic materials, candidal adhesins, and human factors such as fibronectin in initiating these infections has yet to be characterized.\r"

The variables identified by multivariate discriminant analysis as useful independent predictors of postoperative infection were, in order of decreasing importance: length of operation, type of procedure (intracranial, extracranial, or combined), and age. Staged procedures are recommended for craniofacial surgery whenever possible because of the significant increase in rate of infection associated with the monoblock repair.\r"

Two of the patients had prostheses; in neither case did prosthetic infection or prosthetic failure occur. Two syndromes of bacteremic infection with P. putrefaciens are suggested. One syndrome is associated with chronic infection of a lower extremity, is fairly well tolerated, and responds to appropriate antimicrobial agents. The other syndrome is more fulminant and may be associated with severe underlying debility, liver disease, and malignancy. It is not yet known whether this is a meaningful distinction. The significance of the recent increase is the isolation of this organism is not clear at present.\r"

Although these changes produce only subtle effects on the averaged structural properties of the system, the alterations in hydrocarbon chain packing and head-group solvation appear to mimic a polymorphic pretransition from a spherical toward a cylindrical micelle structure.\r"

The probe of the SICM is an electrolyte-filled micropipette. The flow of ions through the opening of the pipette is blocked at short distances between the probe and the surface, thus, limiting the ion conductance. A feedback mechanism can be used to maintain a given conductance and in turn determine the distance to the surface. The SICM can also sample and image the local ion currents above the surfaces. To illustrate its potential for imaging ion currents through channels in membranes, a topographic image of a membrane filter with 0.80-micrometer pores and an image of the ion currents flowing through such pores are presented.\r"

Two DNA oligonucleotides complementary to DHP-receptor RNA sequences coding for putative membrane-spanning regions of the DHP receptor specifically suppress the expression of the DHP-sensitive VDCC from rabbit and rat heart in Xenopus oocytes. However, these oligonucleotides do not suppress the expression of the DHP-insensitive VDCC and of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels. Thus, the gene for DHP receptor of rabbit skeletal muscle is closely related, or identical to, a gene expressed in heart that encodes a component of the DHP-sensitive VDCC. The DHP-sensitive and DHP-insensitive VDCCs are distinct molecular entities.\r"

In mammalian sinoatrial node cells, however, muscarinic stimulation also inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated current (If), which is involved in the generation of pacemaker activity and its acceleration by catecholamines. Acetylcholine at nanomolar concentrations inhibits If and slows spontaneous rate, whereas 20 times higher concentrations are required to activate the acetylcholine-dependent potassium current (IK,ACh). Thus, modulation of If, rather than IK,ACh, is the mechanism underlying the muscarinic control of cardiac pacing at low (nanomolar) acetylcholine concentrations.\r"

Polarized synchrotron radiation was used to examine the x-ray absorption of manganese in oriented chloroplasts. The manganese site, in the \"resting\" (S1) state, is an asymmetric cluster, which probably contains four manganese atoms, with interatomic separations of 2.7 and 3.3 angstroms; the vector formed by the 3.3-angstrom manganese pair is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane. Comparisons with model compounds suggest that the cluster contains bridging oxide or hydroxide ligands connecting the manganese atoms, perhaps with carboxylate bridges connecting the 3.3-angstrom manganese pair.\r"

Two cysteines (Thr21----Cys and Thr142----Cys) were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis into the active-site cleft. These cysteines spontaneously formed a disulfide bond under oxidative conditions in vitro, and the catalytic activity of the oxidized (cross-linked) T4 lysozyme was completely lost. On exposure to reducing agent, however, the disulfide bond was rapidly broken, and the reduced (non-cross-linked) lysozyme was restored to full activity. Thus an enzyme has been engineered such that redox potential can be used to control catalytic activity.\r"

Intubation feeding of sucrose did not increase blood glucose levels. Sucrose is a useless energy source for these birds because they lack a single digestive enzyme (sucrase) on the small intestinal brush border membrane. However, the membranes possessed separate maltase and isomaltase disaccharidases. This expression pattern and expression patterns of membrane disaccharidases among mammals suggest a role for intestinal enzymes in the coevolutionary interactions between vertebrates and their plant food sources.\r"

The gene recognized a 6.4-kilobase transcript that was coexpressed in normal human tissues with the 5.3-kilobase PDGF receptor messenger RNA. Introduction of complementary DNA of the novel gene into COS-1 cells led to expression of proteins that were specifically detected with antiserum directed against a predicted peptide. When the new gene was transfected into COS-1 cells, a characteristic pattern of binding of the PDGF isoforms was observed, which was different from the pattern observed with the known PDGF receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor in response to the PDGF isoforms was also different from the known receptor. The new PDGF receptor gene was localized to chromosome 4q11-4q12. The existence of genes encoding two PDGF receptors that interact in a distinct manner with three different PDGF isoforms likely confers considerable regulatory flexibility in the functional responses to PDGF.\r"

A new class of channel has now been described that is stretch-inactivated. These channels occur in neurons, where they coexist with stretch-activated channels. Both channels are potassium selective. The differing stretch sensitivities of the two channels minimize potassium conductance over an intermediate range of tension, with the consequence that, over this same range, voltage-gated calcium channels are most readily opened. Thus, by setting the relation between membrane tension and transmembrane calcium fluxes, stretch-sensitive potassium channels may participate in the control of calcium-dependent motility in differentiating, regenerating, or migrating neurons.\r"

TGF-alpha messenger RNA and protein are much more abundant in lesional psoriatic epidermis than in normal-appearing skin of psoriatic patients or in normal epidermis. In contrast, messenger RNA levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which inhibits epithelial cell growth, are not significantly different in normal, uninvolved, and lesional psoriatic epidermis. Thus, psoriatic epidermal hyperplasia may involve increased expression of a keratinocyte mitogen (TGF-alpha) rather than deficient expression of a growth inhibitor (TGF-beta 1).\r"

Recently, GHF-1 was shown to be a member of the homeobox family of DNA-binding proteins. An important question is whether GHF-1 controls the expression of other pituitary specific genes, such as prolactin (Prl), expressed in closely related cell types. To this end, GHF-1 was purified from extracts of GH- and Prl-expressing pituitary tumor cells and identified as a 33-kilodalton polypeptide. Although GHF-1 bound to and activated the GH promoter, it did not recognize the Prl promoter. However, at least one other factor in the same extracts, which was easily separated from GHF-1, bound to several sites within the Prl but not the GH promoter. Antibodies to GHF-1 did not react with the Prl binding activity. These results imply that the pituitary-specific expression of GH and Prl is governed by two distinct trans-acting factors.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of routine antibiotic sensitivity testing methods for detecting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was compared with a commercially available screening medium containing 6 micrograms/ml of oxacillin and 4% NaCl. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of methicillin, oxacillin, and oxacillin with 4% NaCl to S aureus using the agar dilution method was also determined. Approximately 90% of S aureus strains produced beta-lactamase and were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. By disk diffusion, no strains were resistant to methicillin, though diameters of zones of inhibition were between 10 and 14 mm in seven strains. All strains proved to be sensitive to methicillin by MIC determinations and on the oxacillin-NaCl screening medium. The MIC of methicillin was 2.5 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains of S aureus, between 0.16 and 0.31 microgram/ml for oxacillin, and 0.08 to 0.16 microgram for oxacillin with 4% NaCl. We concluded that the incidence of MRSA in an outpatient dermatology population is low, and a combination of disk diffusion and oxacillin-NaCl screening is adequate for testing sensitivity.\r"

The colon was the organ most commonly operated upon initially, being involved in ten procedures (38%), all of which were emergencies. The clinical diagnosis of bowel obstruction was made within ten days postoperatively in most cases. Surgical reexploration was required in 15 patients (58%), whereas the obstructive symptoms resolved with nasogastric suction in 11. Two patients, both of whom survived, required resection of strangulated bowel; in both a treatment delay of at least 72 hours was documented. There were two deaths (8%), neither of which was directly related to the bowel obstruction. Diagnosis of this clinical entity requires a high index of suspicion, especially after emergency procedures that involve the colon. Optimal survival is achieved by prompt recognition and early intervention when a mechanical bowel obstruction is suspected in the early postoperative period.\r"

Records were reviewed for patient age, sex, race, acute myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation upon admission, history of smoking, diabetes, and cardiac disease (acute and chronic), admission blood pressure, role of postoperative echocardiography, and New York Heart Association classification (NYHA class). All patients were hemodynamically stable at the time of operation. Forty-two of the 69 patients had a history of smoking, nine were diabetic, and 48 (33 men and 15 women) had hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) on admission. Twelve deaths occurred within the perioperative period. Nine patients had an acute myocardial infarction and 12 had arrhythmias on admission. Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women) were in NYHA class III. A total of 30 patients had died by six months postoperatively, 27 of cardiovascular causes. The perioperative mortality was 12/69 (17%), and long-term mortality was 30/69 (43%). Simultaneous embolus and myocardial infarction was associated with 100% mortality for the patients surviving the operation; 15 patients required another operation for amputation (nine above-knee and six below-knee).\r"

Unused crossmatched blood is withdrawn from the available blood pool for 48 hours and costs the patient $33 per unit. Growing blood shortages and increasing laboratory costs demand reexamination of this practice. The purpose of this study was to examine blood usage in trauma victims and to develop new guidelines for emergency room requests for blood. The following clinical variables were reviewed in 250 trauma victims to determine their value as predictors of blood usage: age, sex, mechanism of injury, initial vital signs, trauma score (TS), and injury severity score (ISS). The best predictor of blood use was the trauma score. Of the total group, 71% had a TS greater than 14; 91% of these patients did not require transfusion. Twenty-eight percent of the total group had a TS equal to or less than 14; 70% of these patients did require transfusion. The data strongly suggest that type and screen can safely replace type and crossmatch as the initial blood bank requests in patients with trauma scores greater than 14. Blood requirements in patients with a trauma score less than or equal to 14 continue to warrant immediate crossmatching.\r"

There was a linear increase in the incidence of hyperthyroidism with age and with an increase in the size of the nodule, especially for nodules more than 3 cm in diameter. There was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism for nodules of the same size when they occurred in patients more than 40 years of age. There was a corresponding increase in hyperthyroidism with an increase in the length of time after the initial detection of the nodule; this finding was significantly greater in patients more than 40 years of age. Thus, the age of the patient was found to be a more important determinant in the production of hyperthyroidism associated with an AFTN than either the size of the nodule or the duration of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "In the ten-year period from 1978 through 1987, 261 patients with intussusception were admitted to Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The diagnosis was established by barium enema or at laparotomy. The patients were divided into two groups; there were 228 children ranging in age from 1 month to 14 years, and 33 adults. Among the children, 134 (59%) were male and 94 (41%) were female, a ratio of 1.4:1. There was no clear seasonal incidence. The age group most commonly affected was between 3 and 11 months of age (72.4%). The classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and rectal bleeding was encountered in 187 cases (82%). Two hundred one cases (88%) were idiopathic, without any definite leading point. In these cases, the ileocecal area was the site most commonly involved (82%), hypertrophic Peyer's patches of the terminal ileum being responsible for 39% of the idiopathic intussusceptions in the ileocolic area. Enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes occurred in 67 of the idiopathic cases (33%). Local pathology or the leading point precipitating intussusception was found in 27 cases (12%); there were eight benign tumors, six malignant tumors, and 13 tumor-like lesions. In 32 of the 33 cases in adults, there was a definite contributing pathologic entity, including 18 benign tumors, 11 malignant tumors, and three tumor-like lesions. In infants and young children, there is usually no apparent predisposing disease, and a contributing or causative local pathologic lesion is seldom found. In contrast, intussusception in adults is almost invariably caused by some preexisting lesion involving the bowel wall. Furthermore, trauma, lymphoid hyperplasia, pregnancy, and viral infection may be possible predisposing factors in the production of intussusception.\r"

The patient's serum was found to have an undetectable level of the sixth component of complement. Congenital absence of one of the terminal proteins in the complement system impairs a patient's ability to eradicate bacteria, and increases susceptibility to recurring infections caused by meningococci and other Neisseria species. Though the serum of complement-deficient patients promotes normal opsonization of bacteria, it is unable to kill meningococci directly. The currently available meningococcal vaccine may augment type-specific antibody, but it does not correct the underlying complement deficiency. The role of self-administered antibiotics in preventing recurrent Neisseria infection remains uncertain.\r"

In those persons with a diffusely dilated duct or \"chain of lakes\" pattern seen on ERCP, ductal drainage was preferred to pancreatic resection because of lower mortality and preservation of endocrine function. Internal ductal drainage as described by Partington, Rochelle, and Thal was the procedure of choice because it provides excellent pain relief and splenectomy is not required. Good or excellent long-term pain relief was achieved in 90% of patients undergoing operative intervention. Ductal drainage was frequently complicated by peptic ulcer disease.

  ".W": "The unpredictable behavior of histologic types and the disputable results of particular surgical procedures have contributed to the controversies surrounding phyllode tumors. The therapeutic issue is further compounded by an imprecise preoperative diagnosis. This is illustrated in our series of 106 patients, in whom 71.7% were mistakenly operated on for fibroadenoma. Since only 15.8% of this group developed local recurrence, it may be acceptable to adopt a watchful policy, unless detailed microscopic assessment of tumor margins provides evidence of inadvertent transection. Reoperation would then be logical advice, as with one of our patients. In patients clinically suspected of having phyllode tumors, tissue diagnosis is preferable to investigative procedures, which are seldom definitive. Our experience has been with frozen-section diagnosis, although trucut core biopsy is certainly an attractive procedure. In 18 patients only 50% were positively identified as having phyllode tumors. The logistic and therapeutic issues related to use of frozen-section diagnosis are discussed. Wide excision has been recommended by many investigators as an appropriate measure, as long as it is technically possible to remove the lesion with an adequate rim of normal breast tissue. This applies especially to young female patients (less than 20 years), in whom conservation of the breast is particularly desirable and whose tumors behave in a more benign manner. On the other hand, mastectomy is necessary if the phyllode tumor is large compared with breast morphologic size,when histologic transformation has taken place, or when clinical behavior takes a more aggressive course. In this retrospective study, conservative surgery is generally practiced for both primary and recurrent tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these patients, 37.7% were asymptomatic, and the initial indication of pHPT was hypercalcemia, which was found unexpectedly on biochemical screening of the serum in elderly patients. Hypertension was twice as common among patients with pHPT as in the general population (36.1%). The next most common presentations were urinary calculi (18%) and mental depression (18%). The most useful discriminant laboratory tests were serum calcium, phosphorus, chloride, and parathormone (PTH). The calculated coefficient of correlation of PTH to land weight was high (r = 0.571, p less than 0.001). There was very significant correlation between PTH and seriousness of bone disease (r = 0.620, p less than 0.001). After parathyroidectomy, 3.3% of patients remained hypercalcemic, 93% were normocalcemic, and 1.6% were hypocalcemic.\r"

  ".W": "This communication concerns the incidence of intra-abdominal surgery in 904 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who were admitted to the Cabrini Medical Center during a 3-year period from January 1985 to January 1988. It was found that 36, or 4.2%, of the patients underwent surgery, including 12 cholecystectomies, 7 splenectomies, 7 appendectomies, 6 laparotomies, and 6 other operations for miscellaneous conditions. It was pointed out that the high incidence of inflammatory involvement of the gallbladder, appendix, and intestines in AIDS patients was in all probability due to the nature of the blood supply to these organs. All receive blood from terminal arteries or vessels with few anastomoses, and therefore when vasculitis ensues it is often followed by gangrene or ulceration of mucosal surfaces. Surgical intervention was deemed advantageous for those patients with splenomegaly and accompanying pancytopenia, acute appendicitis, and lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, but not for those with cholecystitis. The high postoperative mortality rate, 22.2%, was attributed primarily to the immunodeficient state of the patients rather than to complications of their surgery.\r"

One possible cause of this early recurrence is the multiple dissemination of tumor cells via the portal vein in the remnant liver as a result of surgical manipulations. In an attempt to prevent such recurrences, we performed ultrasonically guided, intraoperative portal embolization with starch microspheres in eight patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. These starch microspheres lodge only temporarily in the microvasculature, and there are no adverse effects, such as a rise in portal pressure or postoperative liver dysfunction. To date, there is no recurrence in any patient.\r"

  ".W": "Lower torso ischemia leads during reperfusion to leukocyte (white blood cell)-dependent lung injury. This study tests the intermediary role of oxygen free radicals (OFRs) in mediating this event. Chronically instrumented anesthetized sheep underwent 2 hours of bilateral hindlimb ischemia. In untreated control animals (n = 7), 1 minute after tourniquet release, mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 13 to 38 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), whereas pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged from 4 mm Hg. The pulmonary hypertension was temporally related to an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx) B2 levels from 211 to 735 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). At 30 minutes of reperfusion lung-lymph TxB2 levels rose from 400 to 1005 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). This coincided with an increase in lung-lymph flow from 4.3 to 8.3 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05), which remained elevated for 2 hours, an unchanged lymph/plasma protein ratio, and a rise in lymph protein clearance from 2.6 to 4.6 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05). These changes are consistent with increased lung microvascular permeability. White blood cell count fell during the first hour of reperfusion from 6853 to 3793/mm3 (p less than 0.05), and lung histologic findings showed marked leukosequestration relative to sham animals (n = 3). Pretreatment with the OFR scavengers, superoxide dismutase and catalase both conjugated to polyethylene glycol (n = 6) blunted the rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure to 19 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and prevented the increase in plasma and lymph TxB2 lymph flow, and lymph protein clearance (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) induces hepatic damage in mice caused by lipid peroxidation, and administration of antioxidants (coenzyme Q10 and alpha-tocopherol) suppresses this lipid peroxidation, preserves energy metabolism, and enhances the survival of endotoxin-administered mice. Therefore experiments were done to determine whether experimental endotoxemia in mice affected the levels of endogenous antioxidants and whether treatment with antioxidants altered these levels. Endotoxin produced decreases in hepatic endogenous antioxidants with time: reduced coenzyme Q9, alpha-tocopherol, and reduced glutathione were lowered to 29.9%, 27.1%, and 45.4% of the control levels, respectively, 24 hours after administration. Exogenously administered coenzyme Q10 (oxidized) accumulated in the liver and showed a maximal plateau between 8 and 16 hours after injection when 82% of coenzyme Q10 was converted to the reduced form. Coenzyme Q10 administered with endotoxin totally or partially prevented the decreases in these endogenous antioxidants, and furthermore, total coenzyme Q10 and the reduced form, both at levels of approximately 30 mg protein, were consumed during the period of elevated lipid peroxidation, 16 hours after endotoxin injection. These results indicate that coenzyme Q10 acts in vivo as an antioxidant after it has been converted to the reduced form. alpha-Tocopherol administered also showed an 84-fold accumulation in the liver 8 hours after injection, completely preventing any decrease in endogenous reduced coenzyme Q9 and partially preventing reduction of glutathione, which indicated an in vivo antioxidant action of alpha-tocopherol. These results support the assumption that administered coenzyme Q10 or alpha-tocopherol functions cooperatively with endogenous antioxidants to prevent tissue damage caused by lipid peroxidation in endotoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that biliary lipids influence in vivo gallbladder absorption and solute-coupled water flow. To clarify the electrophysiologic effects that underlie this phenomenon, prairie dog gallbladders were mounted in an Ussing-type chamber, and the influence of bile acids and varying ratios of bile acids and biliary phospholipids on transepithelial potential difference (Vms), resistance (Rt), and short-circuit current (Isc) was examined. Exposure to 5 mmol/L taurodeoxycholate (TDC) resulted in inhibition of Vms (p less than 0.01) and Isc (p less than 0.01) and an increase (p less than 0.05) in Rt. Subsequent perfusion with bile acids and phospholipids (5 mmol/L TDC + 0.3 mmol/L phosphatidylcholine [PC]) led to continued inhibition of ion transport. In contrast, exposure to 5 mmol/L TDC + 1.7 mmol/L PC resulted in a significant increase in transport, as manifested by an increase in Vms (p less than 0.02) and Isc (p less than 0.01) and a decrease in Rt (p less than 0.05) compared with bile acids. These results indicate that the ratio of phospholipids to bile salts modulates ion transport across prairie dog gallbladder and that this ratio may be an important determinant of gallbladder absorption in health and disease.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor microcirculation was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats with solitary intrahepatic implants of Walker carcinosarcoma tumors. Thioflavine S (TS), a fluorescent dye that stains capillary endothelium acutely, was injected intraportally or intra-arterially in order to demonstrate patterns of blood flow through normal liver tissue and through tumor. The dye was given immediately after intraportal injection of 10 micrograms of epinephrine in some animals and 3 minutes after the epinephrine in others. Control animals received TS alone. Additional animals were given TS immediately after intra-arterial epinephrine. The degree of resulting fluorescence in tumor and liver was graded subjectively from 0 to 3+. In the controls and in animals receiving TS 3 minutes after epinephrine, fluorescence in the centers of tumors was absent or, at most, faintly present. In contrast, all animals given epinephrine either intraportally or intra-arterially immediately before the dye showed intense fluorescent staining within the centers of the tumors. Subjective grading averaged 0.6 +/- 0.1 in the controls, 2.2 +/- 0.1 in those receiving intraportal epinephrine immediately before TS, and 1.0 +/- 0.3 in those receiving TS 3 minutes after epinephrine. Results were significantly higher in the latter group (p less than 0.01). Subjective grading in animals receiving intra-arterial epinephrine immediately before TS averaged 2.5 +/- 0.3. These experiments confirm previous studies in this laboratory that demonstrated an acute short-lived redistribution of blood flow into the centers of intrahepatic tumors after administration of epinephrine.\r"

The bladder neck is the site of choice for cuff placement in children. Primary deactivation and moderate or low reservoir pressures (61 to 70 and 71 to 80 cm H2O) are indicated, especially in patients with previous bladder neck surgery or an inadvertent bladder neck injury. Excess residual urine should be evacuated by clean intermittent catheterization. The AS-800 is mechanically reliable (9 mechanical failures in 45 sphincters). When the sphincter is implanted in a select group of patients, upper tract function is maintained in a stable state. Detubularized augmentation cytoplasty must be used to supplement the sphincter in patients with low-compliance, low-capacity, and nonresponsive hyperreflexic bladders. In all patients, long and careful follow-up is necessary to identify late changes in bladder function and consequent upper tract damage. An overall satisfactory result (fair to good) was obtained in 88 per cent of patients during an average follow-up period of 35 months, and 0.6 modifying procedure per patient was done in the sphincters.\r"
