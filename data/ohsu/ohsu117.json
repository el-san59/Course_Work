Chimeric single-stranded RNA molecules were transcribed in vitro from recombinant plasmids and later encapsidated, in vitro, into ribonucleoprotein particles (pseudoviruses) 60 nanometers long that resembled tobacco mosaic virus. Transcripts encoding an assayable enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), were packaged into pseudovirus particles to assess the utility of this single-stranded RNA delivery system in a wide range of cell types. In all cases, packaged CAT messenger RNA was uncoated and transiently expressed. Significantly higher levels of CAT activity were detected with packaged than with naked CAT messenger RNA after inoculation of plant protoplasts in the presence of polyethylene glycol or abrasive inoculation of intact leaf surfaces. Structural events that lead to the uncoating and expression of CAT messenger RNA showed no cell specificity. This observation may support the view that the comparatively restricted host range of a true plant virus results from events that occur later during the infection cycle.\r"

The skin lesions totally resolved over the next nine months, but acute myelomonocytic leukemia subsequently developed. The leukemic blasts in the bone marrow were identical to the malignant cells in the previous skin biopsies. Correct identification of neoplastic skin infiltrations has become increasingly important, since effective therapy is available for many types of neoplasms.

Although body weight was unaffected by the deficiency, the liver, heart, and thymus weights (% body weight) were altered. Hepatomegaly occurred in females fed 0-ppm Cu and males fed 2-ppm Cu. Heart weights increased in both sexes fed 0-ppm Cu. Thymus weights decreased in male rats fed 0-ppm Cu. Antibody titers and natural killer-cell cytotoxicity were markedly suppressed in the animals fed 0-ppm Cu. Male rats given 2-ppm Cu showed reduced antibody titer. Delayed-type hypersensitivity and prostaglandin E2 levels were not significantly affected. These studies suggest that certain components of the immune system are Cu dependent.\r"

The hybridization results for COL1A2 and TCRB are consistent with their previous assignment to 7q21----q22 and 7q32, respectively. Given the location of these six markers and their linkage relationships, it is probable that the cystic fibrosis locus is in either the distal region of band q22 or the proximal region of q31. Using the same set of cell lines, we have also examined the location of another chromosome 7 marker PGY1. The data show that PGY1 is located in the region 7cen----q22, a position very different from its previous assignment.\r"

The biochemical basis of the disease is unknown, and prenatal diagnosis is not available. Subregional localization of the choroideremia locus to Xq13-22 was accomplished initially by linkage to two restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs), DXYS1 (Xq13-q21.1) and DXS3 (Xq21.3-22). We have now extended our linkage analysis to 12 families using nine RFLP markers between Xp11.3 and Xq26. Recombination frequencies of 0%-4% were found between choroideremia and five markers (PGK, DXS3, DXYS12, DXS72, and DXYS1) located in Xq13-22. The families were also used to measure recombination frequencies between RFLP loci to provide parameters for the program LINKMAP. Multipoint analysis with LINKMAP provided overwhelming evidence for placing the choroideremia locus within the region bounded by DXS1 (Xq11-13) and DXS17 (Xq21.3-q22). At a finer level of resolution, multipoint analysis suggested that the choroideremia locus was proximal to DXS3 (384:1 odds) rather than distal to it. Data were insufficient, however, to distinguish between a gene order that puts choroideremia between DXS3 and DXYS1 and one that places choroideremia proximal to both RFLP loci. These results provide linkage mapping of choroideremia and RFLP loci in this region that will be of use for further genetic studies as well as for clinical applications in this and other human diseases.\r"

  ".W": "We isolated X-chromosomal DNA probes from a cosmid library constructed from a single human X/hamster hybrid-cell line (C12D). One hundred human clones were isolated and used to construct a pool of X-chromosomal DNA. This DNA was digested into 0.15-2-kb fragments and subcloned into plasmids allowing the rapid characterization of new single-copy probes. These were regionally mapped and used for the detection of restriction-site polymorphisms. Together with a series of subcloned probes from individually isolated cosmids, we found seven polymorphic probes among 53 tested. Thirty-one of the probes were physically localized to different regions of the X chromosome. Four polymorphic probes map to Xq27-Xq28: DXS102 (cX38.1), DXS105(cX55.7), DXS107(cpX234), and DXS134(cpX67). These were genetically mapped by multipoint analysis relative to previously characterized loci, a mapping that resulted in the following order: DXYS1, DXS107, DXS51/DXS102, F9, DXS105, Fra-X, F8/DXS52, DXS15, DXS134. The mapping of DXS105 between F9 and Fra-X makes this probe useful for Fra-X analysis. For the linkage between FraX and DXS105, a maximum lod score of 5.01 at 4 cMorgans has been obtained in one large Dutch pedigree.\r"

Close linkage was excluded between the MEN2A locus and each marker locus tested. By means of multipoint analysis and the genetic map of chromosome 13 developed by Leppert et al., MEN2A was excluded from any position between the most proximal marker locus (D13S6) and the most distal marker locus (D13S3) and from within 12 cMorgans outside these two loci, respectively. However, the support of exclusion within an interval was diminished under the assumption of a substantially larger genetic map in females. The strategy of multipoint analysis, which excluded between 1.5 and 2.0 times more chromosome 13 than did two-point analysis, demonstrates the utility of linkage maps in mapping disease genes.\r"

The recently isolated cDNA encoding the liver isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase was used to map the gene and identify restriction-fragment polymorphisms in normal Caucasians as a prerequisite for detecting linked GSD VI abnormalities. Results of restriction-enzyme analysis using a downstream fragment of the liver glycogen phosphorylase cDNA indicated the existence of a single gene copy per haploid genome. Hybridization of this downstream liver phosphorylase probe to dual laser-excited, sorted human chromosomes localized the gene to human chromosome 14. When the downstream probe was tested on genomic DNA cut with seven different restriction enzymes, a single MspI restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) was observed in a single individual. In contrast, similar Southern blots performed with an upstream portion of the cDNA encoding liver phosphorylase revealed common RFLPs for four of eight enzymes tested, with minor polymorphic allele frequencies ranging from 33% to 44%. One of the four enzymes (TaqI) revealed two independent polymorphisms. If random distribution of these haplotypes among normal and disease loci, is assumed, approximately 92% of fetuses at risk for Hers disease will be informative when tested with the upstream liver phosphorylase probe.\r"

Animals were treated with either single antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics for four days, and the response was determined by quantitative bacterial count measurements. The selected (induced) resistance was stable for at least four days, both in vivo and in vitro, but was limited to the antibiotic class of the agent used for induction. Four of five isolates for which resistance had been induced by ciprofloxacin returned to preinduction susceptibility by the eight day of subculture. Organisms that were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin were successfully treated by a combination of azlocillin and amikacin, and were as sensitive to that regimen as were the parent, uninduced strains. Organisms selected for resistance by pretreatment with ceftizoxime were successfully treated by the combination of ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, and this regimen was also equally active against the selected strains as it was against the parental isolates. Although selection or induction of resistance is a potential problem with all new potent antimicrobial agents, it appears that infections due to these isolates can still be treated successfully through the use of appropriate combination chemotherapy.\r"

Tissue samples were obtained during abdominal hysterectomy. The ovarian stromal tissue prostaglandin F2 alpha content during the late secretory and early proliferative phases was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than in tissues obtained during any other phases of the menstrual cycle. The ovarian stromal tissue prostaglandin E2 content was significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) during the late proliferative and early secretory phases. The content of the prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite also was elevated (p less than 0.001) in ovarian stromal tissues obtained during the late proliferative and early secretory phases. Comparison of the concentrations of prostaglandins and sex steroids in ovarian stromal and luteal tissues indicate the latter to be far more active in terms of steroid and arachidonate metabolism. During the early luteal phase, when the luteal progesterone content was at its highest, both luteal and ovarian stromal tissue contents of prostaglandin E2 were also elevated. The late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle was characterized by lowered luteal progesterone content and a markedly elevated level of prostaglandin F2 alpha in luteal and ovarian stromal tissues. During cyclic ovarian activity in the woman, prostaglandin E2 predominated during the periovulatory phases while the period of luteal death was highlighted by the elevated prostaglandin F2 alpha content in ovarian stromal and luteal tissues.\r"

With B-5 fixative, viral antigens were readily detected in lymph nodes of 8 of 13 patients with follicular hyperplasia, but in only 1 of 12 patients with follicular atrophy. Antigen was detected in follicular dendritic reticular cells and rare blastlike cells, extracellularly, and in postcapillary venules, medullary lymphocytes, sinus histiocytes, and macrophages in some lymph nodes. In the brain at autopsy, antigen could be found in gliomesenchymal-cell nodules, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, multinucleated cells, and astrocytes and macrophages associated with demyelination. In contrast, 4 rhesus monkeys with experimental SIV infection had abundant antigen in sinus histiocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells of lymph nodes and spleen and in thymic epithelial cells. Brain lesions of monkeys resembled those of humans, with antigen found in macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Antibodies to HIV also were immunoreactive in formalin-fixed tissue sections of monkeys containing SIV antigens. The ABC technique provided a fast and efficient method for localizing HIV and SIV antigens in fixed surgical and autopsy specimens. These findings are consistent with those found with in situ hybridization, ultrastructural studies, frozen sections of lymph nodes, and permanent sections of brain.\r"

  ".W": "The lineage of Ia antigen expressing (Ia+) cells that have been detected in the parenchyma and interstitium of the rat kidney has not been defined. The authors have studied the origins of Ia+ cells in chimeric rats using monoclonal antibodies to define cells of bone marrow and parenchymal origin. PVGc RTI rats (recipients) received intravenously 2 X 10(6) bone marrow cells from F1 hybrid PVG RTIc/RTIu rats (donors) 1 day after 1000 rads whole body irradiation. Ia chimerism was monitored in blood and isolated glomeruli by immunofluorescence and in frozen sections by immunoperoxidase, using monoclonal antibodies MRC OX3 (anti-Ia RTIu), MRC OX4 (anti-RTIc and u), and MRC OXI (anti-rat leukocyte common antigen). In normal F1 hybrid kidneys, glomerular cell counts were as follows: OXI+, 7.19 +/- 0.23/gl; OX4+, 3.03 +/- 0.14; OX3+, 2.34 +/- 0.1 (76% detectable expression of RTIu). OXI+, OX4+, and OX3+ cells were codistributed in cells in the interstitium between renal tubules. Proximal tubules were weakly OX4+, OX3+. In chimeric rats 5 days after irradiation, blood leukocytes, and renal OX1+ and OX4+ cells were depleted; OX3+ cells were not detected; by 4 weeks blood leukocytes were restored to normal numbers, and 85% of Ia+ cells were OX3+. By 6 weeks OXI+ and OX4+ cells were restored in glomeruli and interstitium, with increasing expression of OX3+ cells; at 10 weeks 75% of glomerular Ia+ cells were OX3+ (equivalent to detectable level of OX3+ cells in normal F1 hybrids) and OX1+, OX4+, and OX3+ cells appeared in equivalent numbers in the interstitium. Groups of proximal tubules were OX4+ and OX3-. These results in established bone marrow chimeras show that in the normal rat kidney bone marrow derived leukocytes expressing Ia antigen are present in the glomerulus and interstitium. Ia antigen is also expressed on some proximal tubular cells. There is no evidence for endothelial Ia positivity.\r"

  ".W": "Limb ablation for tumors of the shoulder is a devastating procedure. Recent advances in preoperative investigative measures, adjuvant chemotherapy, and reconstructive techniques have resulted in an increased interest in limb-sparing resection. For limb-sparing procedures to present a viable alternative in these cases, recurrence rates must be comparable to those obtained with ablative surgery. In addition, the resection must result in an improvement over the status obtainable with prosthetic devices. Twenty-four patients underwent limb-salvage procedures of various forms for primary bone tumors of the shoulder girdle. At follow-up (average: 33 months), 19 patients were alive without disease, one was alive with disease, and four were dead. One patient had local recurrence. All surviving patients enjoyed nearly normal function of the distal extremity. Improvements in techniques of soft tissue reconstruction in an effort to gain function and stability after wide resection of these tumors are necessary. Results indicate that these limb-salvage attempts offer successful alternatives to mutilating and crippling proximal amputations of the upper extremity.\r"

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 27 children with HIV infection was assayed for intra-blood-brain barrier (IBBB) synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies and for the presence of HIV antigen. In this cohort, 11 children had a progressive encephalopathy (PE), 9 had a static encephalopathy (SE), and 7 had normal neurological findings (N). IBBB synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies was identified (using matched serum and CSF specimens) in 7 of 11 children with PE, 4 of 9 children with SE, and 2 of 7 children with N. HIV antigen was found (using a highly sensitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay) in the CSF of 8 of 11 children with PE, none of the children with SE, and none of the 7 children with N. On the basis of these data, we conclude that: IBBB synthesis of HIV antibodies indicates invasion of the central nervous system but may reflect prior or current infection; and HIV antigen in CSF indicates viral expression and correlates with the occurrence of PE. These findings strongly implicate HIV as the causative agent of PE in these children. The assay for HIV antigen in the CSF may be of value in determining the prognosis of children with HIV infection and for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents against this retrovirus.\r"

Subjects were confined in the Clinical Research Unit for 13 days and given a xanthine-free diet. A single dose (3 mg/kg) of theophylline was given orally, and blood samples were collected at fixed time intervals for 36 h. The concentrations of theophylline were measured with TDX (Abbott Diagnostics, Irving, Tex.), and clearance was calculated. Theophylline clearance was used to individualize subsequent doses to achieve average steady-state theophylline concentrations in plasma of 10 mg/liter. Individualized theophylline doses were administered every 8 h until steady-state conditions were reached. Theophylline clearance was determined again at steady state and on days 7 and 8. On day 8, ofloxacin (400 mg every 12 h) was given concomitantly with theophylline. Theophylline clearance was measured again on day 12, after the last theophylline dose. Administration of ofloxacin for 1 day did not change theophylline clearance, but coadministration for 4 days significantly decreased theophylline clearance by 12.1% (P less than 0.05). The area under the concentration-time curve for theophylline increased 9.9% (P less than 0.05), and average steady-state concentrations in plasma increased 10.3% (P less than 0.05). Despite changes in clearance, adverse effects of theophylline did not increase during coadministration of ofloxacin. Although statistically significant, the interaction between ofloxacin and theophylline is unlikely to be of major clinical importance.\r"

However, no genetic model was supported unambiguously. The increase in prevalence of depression over the past several decades complicates the genetic interpretation of results. Restriction of analyses to older (age, greater than 18 years) age cohorts appeared to simplify the pattern of transmission, but a consequent reduction of sample size provided only limited power for tests of competing genetic hypotheses. In a subgroup of 28 families in which the proband had both depression and panic disorder, a major gene mode of inheritance was not supported.\r"

When acetylcholinesterase (AchE), a marker of megakaryocytic differentiation in mice, was assayed, a significant inhibition of enzymatic activity was noted in cultures containing the equivalent of greater than 5 X 10(6) solubilized platelets per milliliter. Freeze-thawed extracts of granulocytes had significantly less inhibitory effect than did platelets. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a growth factor known to be inhibitory to some cell lineages and to be found at relatively high concentrations in platelets, was then added to liquid marrow cultures. A similar inhibition of AchE activity was detected when cultures were stimulated with mitogen-stimulated conditioned medium. The effect was potent with 50% inhibition of AchE activity observed at 4 pmol TGF-beta/L. To determine if TGF-beta inhibited specifically one aspect of megakaryocytic differentiation, the factor was added to isolated single megakaryocytes in serumless culture induced by interleukin 3 (IL3) to increase in size. The number of megakaryocytes increasing in size in response to IL 3 exposure was reduced from 68% to 20% when both factors were simultaneously added to cultures. Colony assays showed that megakaryocytic and granulocyte-macrophage colony detection was inhibited at picomolar concentrations of the factor. These data suggest that TGF-beta is a potent in vitro inhibitor of the murine megakaryocytic lineage, although its effects are not limited to this lineage.\r"

  ".W": "Cranial irradiation is an effective prophylactic treatment for subclinical meningeal infiltration in lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, central nervous system (CNS) relapse still occurs in 6-10% of cases overall and in as many as 30% of cases with a poor prognosis in some series. These recurrences may be due in part to inadvertent underdosage of the cribriform plate, which is centrally situated between the orbits and is projected over their upper third in a lateral view. The dose to the adjacent meninges may thus be reduced by shielding of the radiosensitive lenses. This problem is exacerbated if conventional lateral fields centred on the mid-skull are used, because the eyes will not then project over one another. If the field centre is moved to the edge of the orbit, this problem of beam divergence can be overcome. Central axis beam blocking of both lenses is then possible, and in some patients the cribriform plate can be adequately irradiated. However, in most children the geometry of the orbit is such that it is necessary to add an anterior electron beam to ensure homogeneous dosage. These refinements in irradiation technique might prevent meningeal relapse with a lower whole-brain dose and, hence, fewer neuropsychological sequelae. This hypothesis could be tested in a clinical trial.\r"

To select the subjects the genotypes of 60 people from 26 affected families were determined by HLA-A and HLA-B haplotyping. In addition, data for 12 homozygotes for whom erythrocyte ferritin values were available from the literature were included. Likelihood analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of erythrocyte ferritin analysis alone and in combination with serum ferritin testing. An erythrocyte ferritin value of 150 ag/cell or higher combined with a serum ferritin level above the 90th percentile indicated homozygosity, whereas a value of less than 150 ag/cell and a serum ferritin level at or below the 90th percentile indicated that homozygosity could be ruled out with a high degree of confidence. The probability of heterozygosity rose to 92% when the erythrocyte ferritin value was between 29 and 149 ag/cell and to 98% when this result was combined with a serum ferritin level at or below the 90th percentile. Erythrocyte ferritin analysis in combination with serum ferritin testing is useful for identifying homozygotes and a proportion of heterozygotes in families affected with hemochromatosis.\r"

A total of 349 CEAs, 350 TPAs, and 317 CA19-9s were measured. In addition, sera were assayed from 57 patients with pulmonary benign diseases and their CEA, TPA, and CA19-9 levels were used as negative controls for specificity and accuracy. One hundred twenty healthy subjects provided our normal CA19-9 reference value. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained for CEA, TPA, and CA19-9, respectively. Significant intermarker correlations were found both at diagnosis and during follow-up, CEA and CA19-9 being the most closely related substances. The percentage of patients with elevated levels of TPA increased significantly according to tumor load. Individual values of TPA related significantly to the stage of disease. Concentrations of CEA, TPA, and CA19-9 varied significantly during the course of the illness in relation to treatment response; however, TPA showed the closest relationship to the clinical status assessments of the follow-up period. Abnormal pretreatment levels of TPA were significantly associated with a poor outcome. Biomarker combinations were clinically evaluated by calculating the mean of the percentage of the reference value for each combined marker. Using this method, any association of TPA with CEA and/or CA19-9 revealed neither a greater diagnostic accuracy nor a more reliable predictive capacity for the above clinical variables than TPA evaluated on its own. The authors believe that a single TPA assay should be added to the initial and subsequent clinical assessments of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Concentrations of methotrexate have been determined in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid after 406 infusions of methotrexate to 58 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The dose of methotrexate varied between 500 mg/m2 and 33,600 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data has been carried out. The effect of dose, age, and number of treatments on steady-state concentration, serum half-life, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serum distribution ratio, volume of distribution, systemic clearance of methotrexate was examined. The elevation of dose resulted in a nonproportional increase of the steady-state concentrations both in serum and CSF. The great inpatient and interpatient variations of steady-state concentrations caused only statistically not significant differences in the parameters of different subgroups of dosages. Correlation was found between concentrations of methotrexate in serum and CSF. One to 4 years old children were found to have lower steady-state concentrations of methotrexate in the serum and CSF, greater volume of distribution and faster clearance of the drug. Dose-dependency and age-dependency of methotrexate pharmacokinetics has been concluded.\r"

From our results in Group 1 patients it appears that both CA 19-9 and CA 50 maintained an excellent specificity in these patients. As to the sensitivity of these tests, our findings in Group 2 patients are comparable with those reported in patients with cancer and normal renal function. It is concluded that, unlike CEA, these new tumor markers maintain their clinical value in chronic renal failure.\r"

The proximal tibia was the most frequent site of tumor. Men and women were affected in approximately equal numbers. Limb pain and swelling were common complaints, as were findings of limb mass and tenderness. Excision of a tumor demands at least wide margins. When surgical margins were less than wide, there were higher rates of local tumor recurrence and tumor metastasis. A relatively high rate of tumor recurrence and metastasis occurred with femoral lesions despite wide excisional margins, suggesting that femoral lesions may need more aggressive surgical treatment.\r"

The plasma clearance of these substrates was determined before and after remission-induction therapy in 14 children with ALL. We found an improvement in clearance of antipyrine (0.65 to 0.95 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.01) and lorazepam (0.93 to 1.20 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.05) in 12 of 14 patients, with a mean increase of 67% and 52%, respectively, from before to after remission. There was no significant difference in mean indocyanine green clearance from before to after induction (14.8 vs. 14.4 ml/min/kg). There were no significant differences in liver function test results (SGOT, prothrombin time, or serum bilirubin) from before to after induction. Plasma concentrations of albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and apolipoprotein A changed by a mean of +11.1%, -38.2%, and +68.6%, respectively, from before to after remission. However, these changes did not account for the changes in total plasma clearance of lorazepam, because lorazepam free fraction did not change and lorazepam free clearance increased by a mean of 83%. Our hypothesis is that eradication of hepatic leukemic infiltration by ALL remission therapy resulted in an improvement in microsomal metabolism of antipyrine and lorazepam.\r"

Release of prostaglandin E2 into the gastric cavity was also significantly less in the cirrhotic patients in the basal state (p less than 0.025) and in that of tetragastrin stimulation (4 micrograms/kg, s.c.; p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in acid secretion between the two groups of subjects. The histologic findings of biopsy specimens showed no difference in the extent of chronic gastritis between the cirrhotic patients and healthy subjects. Therefore, this deficiency of prostaglandin E2 in the gastric mucosa of cirrhotic patients was not related to acid secretion or chronic gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "The enzymatic hydrolysis of estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to estrone and dehydroisoandrosterone, respectively, was studied in cells that were derived from four different malignant tumors of the lower reproductive tract of women, viz. a squamous cell vaginal carcinoma, an ovarian carcinoma, and two endometrial adenocarcinomas. These cells had the capacity to hydrolyze both steroid sulfoconjugates. Estrone sulfate was more efficient as a substrate than dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, since the amount of product formed from estrone sulfate was approximately 3-fold greater than that formed from dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Some kinetic parameters of steroid sulfatase were determined in the four cell types and were found to be very similar, as were the rates of hydrolysis. Sulfatase activity was linear with incubation time for at least 2 h and with cell number up to 3.2 X 10(6) cells/mL. The apparent pH optimum of steroid sulfatase, determined by the use of cell sonicates and estrone sulfate as the substrate, was between 6.0 and 7.5. The apparent Km values of steroid sulfatase for estrone sulfate in both squamous vaginal carcinoma cells and ovarian carcinoma cells were both 5 microM, and those for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in squamous vaginal carcinoma cells and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells were 6 and 4 microM, respectively. The optimal temperature of steroid sulfatase in squamous vaginal carcinoma cells was 50 C; at this temperature, enzymatic activity was more than twice that at 37 C. The steroid sulfatase pathway that is operative in carcinoma cells in vitro to produce free steroids from steroid sulfate precursors also may serve to produce free steroids in vaginal, endometrial, and ovarian carcinomas in vivo and, perhaps, maintain and stimulate tumor growth.\r"

We have undertaken an intensive reexamination of this kindred and have studied 41 family members in three generations. In this family we document the presence of two distinct apo B alleles associated with low plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) B and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and we trace the inheritance of these two alleles over three generations. One of the alleles resulted in the production of an abnormal, truncated apo B species, apo B-37. The other apo B allele was associated with reduced plasma concentrations of the normal apo B species, apo B-100. H.J.B., the proband, and two of his siblings had both abnormal apo B alleles and were therefore compound heterozygotes for familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Their average LDL-cholesterol level was 6 +/- 9 mg/dl. All of the offspring of the three compound heterozygotes had hypobetalipoproteinemia, and each had evidence of only one of the abnormal apo B alleles. In the entire kindred, we identified six heterozygotes for familial hypobetalipoproteinemia who had only the abnormal apo B-37 allele and their average LDL cholesterol was 31 +/- 12 mg/dl. We identified 10 heterozygotes who had only the allele for reduced plasma concentrations of apo B-100 and their LDL cholesterol level was 31 +/- 15 mg/dl. Unaffected family members (n = 22) had LDL cholesterol levels of 110 +/- 27 mg/dl. This report describes the first kindred in which two distinct abnormal apo B alleles have been identified, both of which are associated with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia.\r"

One patient had chronic myeloid leukaemia, one acute myeloid leukaemia, and the third, refractory anaemia with excess of blasts. This atypical form of pyoderma gangrenosum has been specifically associated with myeloid malignancies. The atypical appearance of the skin lesions and the clinical context in which they arose caused the true diagnosis to be delayed in all cases. Treatment with steroids was associated with rapid healing of the skin lesion. The histopathological changes in the skin biopsy specimens from these cases were non-specific, and although the histology was considered to be atypical of pyoderma gangrenosum in one case, the unusual features could be attributed to the patient's neutropenia. (Skin biopsy was performed to exclude other specific pathology). Atypical bullous pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon association of the myeloid malignancies. It may remain unrecognised and should be considered more often.\r"

An area 3 mm in diameter was irradiated with 300 nm UVB light (40 mJ/cm2). A time sequence study was carried out to 56 days. During this period the Ia-positive ELC population increased stepwise, i.e., first a rapid increase between day 7 and day 14, which we called the early recovery phase, and next a gradual increase between day 42 and day 56, which we called the late recovery phase. During the early recovery phase, we found polymorphous ELCs in the irradiated area which were giant or normal in size, dendritic or round in shape, and single or paired in distribution. Electron microscopy revealed some of round and some of paired ATPase-positive ELCs to be in metaphase or telophase of mitotic division. Within the entire observation period of our study, there was no evidence suggesting migration of ELCs from hair follicles or from the nonirradiated epidermis. These findings indicated that mitosis of ELCs contribute to their repopulation during the early recovery phase.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the intellectual and academic status of 40 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had experienced a primary isolated relapse in the CNS by analyzing the results of psychoeducational tests administered a median of 6.1 years after the relapse. Mean scores for full-scale IQ (87.5), verbal IQ (86.7), performance IQ (90.3), as well as academic achievement in reading (89.8), spelling (83.9), and mathematics (83.5) were significantly below normal expectations for age. Twenty percent of the group were mentally retarded and were receiving special educational assistance. The best clinical predictors of full-scale IQ were the number of radiation therapy courses, age, and the presence or absence of cerebral pathology as measured by computed tomography (CT). Children who were younger at the time of treatment, who received two courses of radiation therapy, and who had clinical seizures and structural abnormalities of the brain as detected by CT had the poorest psychological outcome. Although the psychoeducational consequences of CNS relapse and its attendant treatment are significant, these must be balanced by consideration of the relatively low probability of long-term survival without aggressive therapy. Recognition of this type of delayed morbidity with systematic surveillance and prompt attempts at rehabilitation may decrease or at least minimize these sequelae.\r"

Two to 130 bacteria were cultured per 10 ml venous blood. Endocarditis causing alpha-hemolytic streptococci were found in seven cases (50%). At least one of the predominating anaerobes (Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, or Peptostreptococci) were found in all positive cases. Bacteremia was found in 40% of the Group 2 patients. There was no bacteremia in the Group 3 patients. The pathogenic relevance of anaerobic bacteremia is discussed and as a consequence it is suggested that the risk of developing organ abscesses as well as the problem of endocarditis following dental bacteremia has to be taken into consideration.

The results indicate that little correlation exists between these parameters. Saliva substitutes based on carboxymethylcellulose do not appear to lubricate biocompatible hard interfaces well and, therefore, might not protect against the rapid attrition observed in xerostomic individuals. In contrast, a mucin-based substitute proved to be a better lubricant with values comparable to whole human saliva.\r"

Six adolescent Macaca fascicularis monkeys were randomly divided into two surgical groups and eight others served as controls. Group I animals underwent a Le Fort I advancement and Group II animals experienced a Le Fort I advancement and impaction. All monkeys received tantalum implants in the anterior part of the cranial base, on opposite sides of craniofacial sutures and in multiple sites of the maxilla and mandible. The immediate postsurgical occlusion of all experimental animals was a Class II molar relationship. The animals were followed for up to 12 months postoperatively. Analysis of cephalometric head films taken at monthly intervals showed that both the maxilla and the mandible of all experimental monkeys grew in a coordinated fashion, although the amount, rate, and direction of growth varied between control and experimental animals as well as between Group I and Group II animals. The largest increments and rates of growth were observed in the control animals, Group I animals, and Group II animals, respectively. This study indicates that the growth changes in both maxilla and mandible are related to the extent of injury caused by maxillary surgery. The results also showed that although the surgical procedures were performed in the maxilla, mandibular growth was significantly modulated by the surgically changed maxillary environment.\r"

The results of the examination of both cases were as follows: the benign tumor (angiomyoma) was composed of mainly mature smooth muscle cells having dark cytoplasm, and the malignant tumor (leiomyosarcoma) consisted mainly of two types of cells, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells or fibroblast-like cells (type I) and myofibroblast-like cells (type II). Based upon these results, the relationship between the myogenous differentiation and the component cell types, and biological behavior of these smooth muscle tumors was discussed.\r"

As in our previous study, we observed increased rates of whole body protein synthesis (S) and breakdown (B) in comparison to healthy controls. In eight patients, we assessed basal metabolic rate (BMR). There was a significant linear regression between BMR (kcal/d) (Y) and S (g protein/d) (X): y = 3.7 X + 850 (R = 0.925, p less than 0.001). There was also a significant linear correlation between BMR, expressed as a percentage of the normal value, and S expressed as a percentage of the mean value in the healthy children (r = 0.79, p less than 0.05). There were also significant positive correlations between BMR and body weight (r = 0.75, p less than 0.05) or age (r = 0.83, p less than 0.05) and between S and weight or age (both, r = 0.86, p less than 0.01). BMR (kcal/d) also correlated with B (g protein/d) (r = 0.91, p less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMR was much more highly related to S than to weight. These data suggest that increased rates of S are closely related to increased energy requirements in patients with ALL. Furthermore, these data provide evidence for the biological relevance of whole body protein kinetics.\r"

Although pleural mesothelioma was more common than peritoneal mesothelioma, both are rare diseases in this country. Pleural mesothelioma incidence rates among white males increased over time and were highest in seaboard areas where shipyards have been located (Seattle, San Francisco-Oakland, Hawaii). The significant secular change was attributed to both period (date of diagnosis) and cohort (date of birth) effects. Pleural mesothelioma incidence rates among white males were nearly 50% higher in the 1980-84 period compared to those in 1975-79; the cohort effect rose to a peak for the 1905-9 birth cohort and then declined. These effects probably reflect changes in asbestos exposure patterns in the past and more recent changes in clinical awareness and coding rules for mesothelioma. Geographic analysis of U.S. death certificates for pleural cancer among white males and females dying during 1968-78 indicated that mortality rates were significantly elevated in several areas that have had asbestos-manufacturing plants or shipyards. Analyses of mortality rates must be viewed with caution, since mesothelioma is considerably underreported on death certificates.\r"

Of the nonlymphoid tumors tested, IgG binding was restricted to the cell membranes of certain prostate and urinary bladder tumor cell lines. Although most cell lines tested shared a common antigenic determinant with monocytes and granulocytes, these cells did not express T- and B-cell antigens, the complement 3b receptor, or bind a monoclonal antibody specific for the Fc receptor expressed on human neutrophils. The facts that IgG binding was present on long-term established tumor lines and was not influenced by in vitro passage provide evidence that these properties are intrinsic to the tumor cells and may play some role in the pathophysiology of these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The potential of radioiodinated monoclonal antibody B72.3 for lymphoscintigraphy was evaluated, using suitable animal models of a human colorectal carcinoma. LS174T xenografts were grown at various sites in beta-estradiol-pretreated athymic mice, and the development of metastases in different organs was assessed histologically. After iv inoculation of the mice, 66% of the animals developed \"metastases\" to the axillary lymph nodes. Of these mice, 100% also developed multiple tumors on their backs and 79% had lung micrometastases. Livers, kidneys, and spleens showed no evidence of tumor growth. In 33% of the mice in which primary LS174T tumors had been removed from the hindfoot pad, metastases to the popliteal lymph nodes were observed 3 1/2 weeks after tumor implantation. BALB/c (nu/nu) female mice bearing axillary and popliteal lymph node metastases were used to test the potential of radiolabeled B72.3 antibody (an IgG1) as a lymphoscintigraphic agent. A monoclonal antibody against horseradish peroxidase (also an IgG1), which did not bind LS174T tumor cells in vitro, served as a control. Both normal and tumor-bearing axillary and popliteal lymph nodes imaged up to 6 hours after the sc injection of 20-40 mu Ci of 125I-labeled B72.3 into either the forefoot or hindfoot pads. The localization index (L.I.) (specific/nonspecific antibody in tumor divided by specific/nonspecific antibody in blood) for LS174T tumors in lymph nodes was approximately 1 during the first 6 hours after antibody injection, thus indicating no specific antibody accumulation. Twenty-four hours and later after sc injection, images of nodal metastases (14-477 mg) and specific antibody accumulations were observed. At these times the L.I.'s ranged 1.5-3.5. Tumor-negative nodes did not image at 24 hours after injection of 125I-labeled B72.3. The L.I.'s of the normal nodes and of other tissues from these mice were about 1.0 at 24 hours, indicating no specific antibody accumulation. Autoradiographic analysis of lymph nodes containing LS174T tumor showed heterogeneous antibody distribution of B72.3 within tumor sections with heavy patches of antibody accumulation in mucin globules. In lymph nodes the normal lymphocytes adjacent to the LS174T tumor cells showed no antibody accumulation. The lack of specific, early antibody accumulation by LS174T tumor-bearing nodes in mice suggests that B72.3 does not accumulate in nodal metastases to the degree necessary to consider it a potential agent for use in lymphoscintigraphy.\r"

Twenty-five neoplasms were sensitive to Ilmofosine within the concentration range tested (0-16 micrograms/ml). The most susceptible tumors were 2 colon carcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas and 1 small-cell carcinoma of the lungs, 2 myosarcomas, 2 ovarian carcinomas, 1 gallbladder carcinoma, and 1 pleural mesothelioma with 50% colony formation inhibition doses ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml.

Girls who died of solid tumors between ages 1 and 10 had a significantly higher mean birth weight and an excess of high birth weights separate from the influence of maternal age, birth order, and socioeconomic status. Boys who died of solid tumors between birth and 2 years had a significantly lower mean birth weight and exhibited a significant, progressive linear decrease in representation across the birth-weight distribution in the controlled analysis. However, this study, the largest to date, did not support previous claims that birth weight may be an important predictor of childhood cancer risk.\r"

The conjugate was highly potent (50% inhibition dose of 5 X 10(-11)-10(-13) M on antigen-positive melanoma) and highly selective (5 X 10(-8) on antigen-negative melanoma). Human melanoma cells were selected for resistance to in vitro killing of the PAP conjugate by cycling through a killing and recovery sequence. Resultant cultures were shown to be more than 2 logs less sensitive to the killing of the PAP conjugate than untreated cultures. Isolation of clones by limiting dilution and reanalysis indicated that the resistant polyclonal culture contained clones with a range of sensitivities. Resistant cultures were also resistant to other A-chain conjugates of 9.2.27, but not to intact toxins like ricin and abrin. Resistant cultures showed no change in antigen expression after selection with the PAP conjugate of 9.2.27. Thus, just as with many other chemotherapeutic agents, tumor cells can become resistant to agents inhibiting protein synthesis even when targeted with monoclonal antibody. The mechanisms of this resistance and modalities to minimize resistance are currently being explored.\r"

Their response has been previously correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) positivity. MDA-MB-231 cells were ER negative and insensitive to the antiproliferative effects of retinoids. However, their growth was markedly inhibited by agents that elevated intracellular cAMP levels, i.e., 8-bromo-cAMP, cholera toxin (CT), forskolin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine. The CT and forskolin inhibition of the ER-positive cells (MCF-7) was associated with an elevation of adenylate cyclase activity and intracellular cAMP levels; however, similar elevations in intracellular cAMP levels were not observed following CT or forskolin inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cells but only following the addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine.\r"

  ".W": "With the use of data from the 8,764 subjects in the National Bladder Cancer Study, the separate contribution of various aspects of a person's cigarette smoking history to his increased risk of bladder cancer was estimated. These estimates have not been previously available, owing to the smaller sizes of earlier studies. Our data indicated that people who have only smoked unfiltered cigarettes have higher risks than those who have only smoked filtered cigarettes but that people who have switched from unfiltered to filtered have experienced no reduction in risk. Our data also indicated that smoking cessation substantially reduced the risk. The former smoker appeared to benefit both because he stopped adding to the burden of irreversible damage and because he ceased being exposed to some reversible hazard. Thus the former smoker had a lower risk than the current smoker even though they had smoked the same number of cigarettes daily for the same number of years, but the former smoker's risk remained higher than the risk of a person who never smoked. Our data suggest that one-half of the bladder cancer occurring among men in the United States and one-third of that among women is caused by cigarette smoking.\r"

  ".W": "An industry-wide retrospective cohort mortality study was conducted on 6,152 chemical workers (2,460 exposed and 3,692 nonexposed) engaged in chloromethyl ether manufacture at 7 major U.S. companies between 1948 and 1980. A previous study at 6 companies from 1948 through 1972 reported excess respiratory cancer (RC) mortality and significant exposure-response relationships in exposed workers at 1 company (company 2). The present study, which extended follow-up of an additional 7 years for companies 1-6 and included company 7 for follow-up from 1953 through 1980, found excess RC mortality in exposed workers at company 2 [observed (Obs) = 32, standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 430] and company 7 (Obs = 9, SMR = 603). External comparisons of RC mortality at both companies showed significant exposure-response relationships with respect to cumulative time-weighted exposure. At company 2, where the greatest number of RC deaths occurred, external comparisons showed that RC risk remained constant in relation to age at first exposure and decreased with increasing time since last exposure. With the use of Mantel-Haenszel and relative risk (RR) regression methods, internal comparisons at company 2 demonstrated significant findings of increasing RR with cumulative duration of exposure and cumulative time-weighted exposure and with decreasing time since last exposure. No association was found between RR and age at first exposure. An interesting finding was a significant negative interaction between cumulative time-weighted exposure and age at risk. The best-fitting logistic regression model for the exposed group predicted RR at 2.79 (95% confidence interval = 1.66-4.69) for workers with the mean cumulative exposure score of the 32 RC deaths (lagged by 6 yr) compared with those with negligible exposure (assuming mean age at risk of the RC deaths, 51 years old, and time since last exposure held constant). Qualitative assessment of the results suggests that chloromethyl ether exposure affects both an early as well as a late stage of a putative multistage respiratory malignant process.\r"

The panel agreed with the reported diagnosis of NHL in 93% of cases, but with the NHL subtype in only 55% of cases overall. The ability of the panelists to agree among themselves, however, was only slightly better than the panelists' agreement with the reported diagnosis (60% vs. 54%, respectively). Agreement of the panel with the reported subtype diagnosis varied from 14% to over 90%. The best agreement was with small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular subtypes. Conclusions from this study are: 1) The WF functions well as common language for translation and comparison of diagnoses of subtypes of NHL. 2) Relative to time and cost involved, panel review using only light microscopy may not be useful in epidemiologic studies of NHL. 3) Small lymphocytic and follicular subtypes of NHL can be used more confidently in epidemiologic studies than can other subtypes whether the subtyping is done from abstracted reports or by panel review.\r"

Overall, there was good reproducibility of positivity, target site, and carcinogenic potency in hamsters, mice, and rats. The published authors' opinions about whether the test was positive disagreed in only 9 of the 70 comparisons. Among the 35 comparisons in which all tests of the chemical were positive, 33 of the near-replicates had at least 1 identical target site. The carcinogenic potency values estimated from near-replicate tests in these 35 comparisons were within a factor of 2 of each other in 40% of the comparisons, within a factor of 5 in 80%, and within a factor of 10 in 90%. For the few cases in which the carcinogenic response was not reproduced, analyses suggest two explanations: In mice the discrepant cases tended to have shorter experiment times than average; in both rats and mice the discrepant results tended to be tests of weakly active compounds.\r"

Detergent-solubilized glycoproteins, with epiglycanin activity, from fetal tissues and cells were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein bands electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose gel. After the antigens were labeled with rabbit anti-epiglycanin antiserum and [125I]epiglycanin, autoradiography revealed two major bands containing the antigenic determinant at Mr 90,000 and 82,000. Bands of similar molecular weights, but with no demonstrated immunologic cross-reactivity, were observed by fluorography, if intact cells prior to solubilization were labeled by galactose oxidase followed by sodium borotritiide. Immunoreactive epiglycanin activity could be destroyed by Pronase, endo-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminidase (Diplococcus pneumoniae), or periodate oxidation. Activity was enhanced with neuraminidase. The spleen, liver, or erythrocytes from adult A/J mice did not possess the antigen, but incubation of adult spleen or liver with neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) exposed the epitope.\r"

Rhabdomyosarcomas were locally induced by one im injection of Ni or Ni subsulfide [(Ni3S2) CAS: 12035-72-2] dust in the hind leg of WAG rats. A weakly tumorigenic dose of 5 mg Ni3S2 (tumor incidence, 2%) induced a transient decrease of PBMC NK activity against YAC-1 cells in vitro (from the 17th to the 23d wk after Ni3S2 inoculation), which could be restored by in vivo injections of partially purified rat fibroblastic interferon (IFN). Injection of 20 mg Ni (tumor incidence, 47.5%) produced a long-lasting depression of NK cell activity (from the 8th to the 23d wk). In vivo chronic IFN treatment of the Ni-injected rats neither restored NK cell activity nor affected the tumor incidence. However, NK cells of Ni-treated animals responded normally to IFN in vitro. Prospective analysis of individual NK cell responses showed that a persistent depression of basal NK cell activity was restricted to rats that subsequently developed a tumor. In these animals the time between carcinogen treatment and clinical detection of the primary tumor was positively correlated with the mean level of NK cell activity (3-4 determinations/rat). Admixture of manganese to Ni inhibited the development of tumors and also prevented the depression of NK cell activity produced by Ni alone. Noncarcinogenic Ni oxide stimulated NK cell activity. These results point out the possible involvement of NK cells in resistance to Ni-induced carcinogenesis.\r"

When autopsied 31 weeks after the first DMH injection, the incidence (percent of mice with tumors) and multiplicity (number of tumors/tumor-bearing mouse) of colon tumors were reduced by half in the mice supplemented with beta-carotene. There was a much greater decrease in adenocarcinomas than in adenomas. Mice observed for 13 additional weeks revealed that the mortality rate, due largely or wholly to colon cancer, was only about half in supplemented mice. Mice sacrificed 12 weeks after the first dose of DMH (i.e., well before tumors appeared) showed mild colon mucosal hyperplasia. beta-Carotene supplementation, however, did not alter this, indicating that the protective effect against colon cancer may have occurred at a late stage of carcinogenesis.\r"

Clones that expressed Dd antigen were injected into the footpads of nonimmune syngeneic mice, syngeneic immune mice, and nude mice. Under conditions of immunologic selection a clone that contained multiple copies of the transfected gene formed variants that lacked the transfected gene. Primary tumors and pulmonary metastases of immunized mice and pulmonary metastases of nonimmunized mice had lost the Dd gene and, in most cases, all of the associated plasmid. In contrast, in immunodeficient nude mice, primary tumors and pulmonary metastases retained the Dd gene and the associated plasmid. Deletion of genes encoding cell surface antigens may be one of the mechanisms by which allogeneic tumors escape immunologic attack.\r"

Carcinomas, for the most part adenocarcinomas, occurred in 90% of the CON and PD rats and approximately 60% of the RB and GF rats. Carcinomas did not develop in OV rats. The mean life-span of the CON and PD rats was 22 months. The RB and GF rats reached, respectively, 32 and 30 months; and the OV rats, 39 months. An essential influence of ovarian hormones on tumorigenesis was shown. Alimentary carcinogens and phytoestrogens, as well as chronic irritations of the endometrium due to bacteriologic inflammations, could be excluded as tumor initiators. Hormonal dysregulation in the aging BD II/Han rats was discussed as a possible cause of an inappropriate stimulation of the endometrium, promoting a previously transformed tumor cell or initiating an autonomous tumor growth. Such evidence supports the use of the BD II/Han rat as a suitable model for the study of hormonal effects on the tumorigenesis of endometrial carcinomas in women.\r"

Adenosine diphosphate and thrombin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations in renal but not in peripheral arteries.

In all 9 patients who were positive for HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before therapy, levels became undetectable between days 10 and 40 of the start of therapy. 6 of the 7 patients with ARC or LAS also showed a progressive reduction in HIV load as measured by co-culture assays. All 10 patients had augmentation of delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions. Other changes noted during ampligen therapy included an increase in or maintenance of numbers of helper-inducer T lymphocytes, improvements in HIV-related symptoms, rises in titre of neutralising antibodies against HIV, and restoration of proper functioning of the natural lymphocyte antiviral dsRNA-dependent (2'-5'-oligoadenylate/RNA-ase L) pathway.

  ".W": "Oncogene abnormalities are thought to have a central role in some human malignant disorders, particularly Burkitt leukaemia/lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). However, the extent to which specific oncogene changes determine the clinical features of these disorders is unknown. This question was studied in two groups of patients with CML negative for the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome; one group showed clinical features typical of Ph-positive CML and the other group lacked such features. Molecular findings were compared with those of Ph-positive CML. In all ten patients there was evidence for rearrangement of the bcr (breakpoint cluster region) gene. In the four cases studied the c-abl proto-oncogene was translocated to chromosome 22 and in five cases there was transcription of a chimeric bcr-abl mRNA. Thus, the molecular abnormality is the same in both groups of Ph-negative CML and identical to that in Ph-positive CML. Factors other than the bcr/c-abl rearrangement must underlie the clinical heterogeneity of CML.\r"

Inappropriate release of thyrotropin by these tumors can result in hyperthyroidism. We treated five patients who had thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas with the long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995, which was administered by subcutaneous injection in doses of 50 to 100 micrograms every 8 to 12 hours. Serum levels of thyrotropin were dramatically reduced by treatment in four of the five patients, and levels of another tumor marker, the alpha-subunit of thyrotropin, were reduced in all five. In two patients with hyperthyroidism due to production of excess thyrotropin by the tumor, treatment with the somatostatin analogue resulted in a sustained euthyroid state. One patient who was treated for more than 16 months had a persistent reduction in serum levels of thyrotropin and iodothyronines. We conclude that SMS 201-995 is an effective means of controlling hypersecretion of thyrotropin and the associated hyperthyroidism due to thyrotropin-secreting pituitary tumors.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the mechanism of hyperuricemia in glycogen storage diseases (glycogenoses) that affect muscle, we studied the effects of exercise and prolonged rest on purine metabolism in two patients with glycogenosis type III (debrancher deficiency), one patient with type V (muscle phosphorylase deficiency), and one patient with type VII (muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency). All had hyperuricemia except for one patient with glycogenosis type III. Plasma concentrations of ammonia, inosine, and hypoxanthine increased markedly in all the patients after mild leg exercise on a bicycle ergometer. The plasma urate concentrations also increased, but with a delayed response. Urinary excretion of inosine, hypoxanthine, and urate increased greatly after exercise, consistently with the increases in plasma levels. Hypoxanthine and urate concentrations were extremely high in the plasma and urine of the patient with glycogenosis type VII. With bed rest, the plasma hypoxanthine level returned to normal within a few hours, and the plasma urate concentration decreased from 18.6 to 10.6 mg per deciliter (1106 to 630 mumol per liter) within 48 hours. Similarly, the urinary excretion of these purine metabolites was reduced by bed rest. These findings indicate that muscular exertion in patients with glycogenosis types III, V, and VII causes excessive increases in blood ammonia, inosine, and hypoxanthine due to accelerated degradation of muscle purine nucleotides. These purine metabolites subsequently serve as substrates for the synthesis of uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia.\r"

Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, afflicts over ten million people, primarily in developing countries. M. tuberculosis and mycobacteria of the M. avium-intracellulare-scrofulaceum (MAIS) group are major opportunistic pathogens of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). M. paratuberculosis is the cause of Johne's disease in cattle. Yet, BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin), an avirulent strain of M. bovis, is the most widely used human vaccine in the world, having been administered to about 2.5 X 10(9) people since 1948 (ref. 4). BCG was highly protective against tuberculosis in England, but has been found not to be effective in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis in adults in Southern India. We have initiated studies to develop the methodology for efficient gene transfer in mycobacteria. We have constructed recombinant shuttle phasmids which are chimaeras containing mycobacteriophage DNA into which an E. coli cosmid is inserted. They can replicate in E. coli as plasmids and in mycobacteria as phages, and transfer DNA across both genera. These shuttle vectors permit for the first time the introduction of foreign DNA by infection into M. smegmatis and BCG. By introducing and ultimately expressing genes for protective antigens for a variety of pathogens, it may be possible to develop cultivatable mycobacteria into useful multivaccine vehicles.\r"

  ".W": "Apertognathia (open bite) is usually a developmental deformity of the jaws and the dentoalveolar segments in childhood and adolescence. The sudden insidious appearance of an open anterior bite in adult life is extremely rare and may be due to pathologic condylar fractures (with displacement) or to bilateral condylosis. To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of bilateral mandibular condylosis in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) have been reported in the literature, and the present article deals with the sixth known case. In the 22-year-old woman presented in this article the mandibular manifestations were the very early symptoms of PSS, which had a very rapid fatal course. A review of the literature is presented, and attention is called to the serious significance of sudden apertognathia. PSS is a chronic generalized disease of the small arterial vessels and the mesenchyme tissues of unknown origin. The musculoskeletal system is often involved, and the disease may affect the mandible, causing bony erosions, osteolysis, and atrophy of the masticatory muscles. It is believed that these bony lesions are of ischemic origin. The lesions, which are usually bilateral, occur only in the condyles, the coronoid processes, and the gonial angles. The main arterial blood supply to the mandible and to the major part of the ascending ramus originates from the inferior alveolar artery. The blood supply of the condyles, the coronoid processes, and the gonial angles originates in small muscular arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coronoid process elongation tends to be overlooked when limitation of mouth-opening ability is investigated, since most interest is focused on the joint. To study the frequency of coronoid process hyperplasia and its possible association with TMJ disk displacement, 163 patients with limited mouth-opening ability were examined. All patients were referred for radiographic examination of the TMJs. In eight patients (5%), the limitation of mouth-opening ability was caused by elongation of the coronoid process. Four cases were of congenital origin, and four were secondary to long-standing disk displacement without reduction. The results of this study indicate that elongation of the coronoid process is more common than previously thought. In cases of limited mouth opening, attention should be paid to the possibility of coronoid process locking.\r"

In addition, most of the studies used HBO as an adjunctive treatment in the management of refractory osteoradionecrosis. The efficacy of HBO as a primary treatment modality has not as yet been established. Strictly controlled clinical trials are necessary for identification of patients who are likely to respond to HBO without aggressive surgery, to delineate a timetable for treatment of patients with HBO, and to coordinate surgery with HBO to resolve osteoradionecrosis when a significant amount of bone loss is involved.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of fibronectin application on healing of replanted teeth. Three rhesus monkeys were used. Maxillary and mandibular incisors and premolars were extracted and replanted. Teeth were extracted with forceps and placed in saline solution. After 5 minutes, each tooth was returned to its socket and immobilized by interproximal acid-etch splints, which were removed after 1 week. Of the forty-eight teeth replanted, twenty-four control teeth were replanted as described. On each of the remaining teeth, the root surface and the inner walls of the socket were bathed with 1 ml of fibronectin in saline solution (400 micrograms/ml) during the 5-minute interval between tooth extraction and its replantation. Replanted teeth and animal killings were scheduled to provide observations 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 45 days after replantation. Each monkey received an intravenous injection of tritiated thymidine, 1 microCi/g body weight, 1 hour before it was killed. Tissue specimens were processed for histologic and autoradiographic evaluation following standard procedures. For each of the six points of time, four pairs of contralateral teeth were available for evaluation; four teeth were treated with fibronectin and four without it. The findings of this study indicate that fibronectin use resulted in enhanced healing by early replacement of the fibrin clot, increased connective tissue cell proliferation, reduction of the inflammatory response, and inhibition of both cementum resorption and dentoalveolar ankylosis.\r"

The nature of the relationship is uncertain, but it may involve a localized infection of the palatal mucosa by Candida species, from the MRG. Alternatively, irritation by soluble, possibly Candida-related factors from the MRG that are applied repeatedly to the palatal mucosa during swallowing may be responsible.\r"

These comprised 35 squamous cell carcinomas obtained from 22 patients and 9 specimens of clinically healthy mucosa. The carcinoma specimens included 10 primary lesions and 25 recurrent lesions from patients who had undergone radiotherapy. The results showed that the specimens of normal oral mucosa stained at higher antibody titers than either group of carcinomas, and that postradiation recurrent tumors stained at higher titers than primary tumors. In 10 patients, both preradiation and postradiation carcinomas were examined; the postradiation lesions showed increased reactivity in 5 patients, no change in 3 patients, and a decrease in antigen reactivity in 2 patients. The expression of antigen H type 2 in the recurrent tumors appeared to correlate with the estimated daily tumor radiation dose; tumors with specific antigen staining took twice as long to recur after radiotherapy than tumors without similar staining. The results suggest that the expression of the blood group H antigen type 2 substance, being a differentiation antigen, is enhanced by the effect of radiation on the malignant cell.\r"

The radiographs were viewed by ten dentists who judged the presence and extent of caries according to a predetermined scale. Inter-rater reliability was determined for each film type and tooth surface by using Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation Test. Results showed that inter-rater reliability was high and significant at p less than 0.01. Differences in kilovolt (peak) exposure had no significant effect on Ektaspeed and Ultraspeed film correlation. This study suggests no statistically significant difference in caries-detection ability for Ektaspeed or Ultraspeed radiographic film.\r"

For this purpose, 51 subjects of different nationalities were examined. None of the 51 persons had a TMJ disorder. The mobility of the mandible in different directions was clinically measured. With the use of two different reference lines (Methods A and B), the amount of the movement of the condyle from closed to maximal mouth opening position was measured in the sagittal plane on lateral tomograms. All of the measurements were recorded, and the means, SD, and range of variation were calculated. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed. The clinical results are comparable to those of other previous clinical studies. As seen in the lateral tomograms, the condyle in 41 out of 51 subjects moved beyond the articular eminence during maximal mouth opening. It was occasionally situated higher than the eminence. In only ten subjects, the condyle reached only the top of the articular eminence during maximal mouth opening. A moderate degree of dependency and correlation was found between maximal vertical movement of the mandible and the amount of movement of the right and left condyles from closed to maximal open position of the mouth, as seen in tomograms. None of our subjects had any sign of luxation despite the position of the condyle beyond the articular eminence with maximal mouth opening. Therefore, the diagnosis of condylar luxation cannot be established by radiologic investigation alone.\r"

Fourteen patients (20%), in whom clicking disappeared, attained normal mouth opening, whereas locking developed in six patients (9%). At the initial examination, these six patients had more pain, more frequent joint tenderness, greater frequency of missing molar support and more often dental abrasion on the affected side than the patients who did not develop locking. It was concluded that reciprocal clicking does not usually progress to locking. However, locking is more likely to occur in patients who initially have pronounced pain, joint tenderness, dental abrasion, and no molar support on the affected side.\r"

In the second case an enlarged tongue had produced displacement of the teeth, causing malocclusion. The resulting difficulty in chewing stimulated the patient to seek advice. In each case the diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy, Congo red staining, and serum and urine electrophoresis.\r"

Thin tissue sections were examined without decalcification. This permitted excellent observation of the hydroxyapatite particles, the bone, and the soft tissue. Osseointegration had occurred only in the areas closely associated with the bone. The immobility of the particles was a prerequisite for involvement with new bone formation. Hydroxyapatite particles in areas that allowed any mobility were surrounded by connective tissue with no bone formation evident. Heterogeneous particles were observed, indicating the possibility of a lack of purity in the hydroxyapatite ceramic, which may have contributed to the resorption of the particles. These findings, as well as other clinical and experimental findings, lead us to question the concept of hydroxyapatite as a bioactive ceramic that induces osteogenesis or osteoconductivity.\r"

Compound and junctional nevi are rare, and combined nevi are the rarest. The data on location, presence of clinical pigmentation, configuration, size, and duration of the nevi, as well as on the patient's age, sex, and race, are analyzed. Blue nevi were found mostly on the hard palate, whereas intramucosal nevi occurred on the buccal mucosa, on the gingiva, and on the lips as well as on the palate. Nonpigmented nevi were especially common (22%) in the intramucosal group. Most oral nevi are raised, which can be of help in the differential diagnosis. Oral nevi are small, most being between 0.1 and 0.6 cm at the largest dimension. Because the malignant potential of oral nevi is still uncertain and because preexisting macular pigmentation is present in about one third of all patients with oral melanoma, it is advisable to accurately diagnose all oral pigmented lesions, many of which will require microscopic examination.\r"

The primary symptom was a painless swelling of the palate, which was partially ulcerated with a granulomatous appearance. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells were mainly composed of differentiated acinuslike cells containing numerous round secretory granules identical to those in normal serous salivary glands. The tumor cells frequently contained numerous long crystalloid structures in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, tumor cells demonstrating degrees of squamous differentiation were present. These cells contained intracytoplasmic keratin filaments and a few keratohyaline granules. They formed a glandular acinar space in direct contact with the typical acinic cells with secretory granules. These observations suggest that acinic tumor cells have a degree of multipotentiality.\r"

Seven lesions occurred in the posterior body of the mandible, and one occurred in the premolar region of the maxilla. All lesions were treated with surgical excision, and no recurrences were identified during follow-up periods of 6 to 144 months. Two additional cases also appear to represent instances of this neoplasm, which bring the total number identified to ten.

In this study two pairs of observers independently examined the lymph nodes of hemophiliacs younger than 18 years of age to determine the level of agreement of assessments of lymph node mass (the product of the number and mean diameter of lymph nodes). Spearman correlation coefficients for the first and second pairs of observers were 0.75 (P less than 0.001) and 0.66 (P less than 0.005), respectively. The range of lymph node mass was quite different for controls (2.8 to 3.8), human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV)-seronegative hemophiliacs (4 to 5.7) and HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs (10.3 to 15.6). The HIV serologic status could be predicted by lymph node mass. In this group of hemophiliacs, if the lymph node mass was less than 5 cm, the probability of being HIV-seropositive was 0.14. The corresponding probabilities if the lymph node mass was in the range 5 to 9.99, 10 to 14.99, 15 to 19.99 and 20 or greater were 0.33, 0.8, 0.67 and 1.00, respectively. Thus there is adequate agreement between observers in assessing the lymph node mass and there is a direct relationship between lymph node mass and evidence of infection with HIV.\r"

Triton X-100 removal of the external nuclear membrane from loaded vesicles, as well as comparative studies with open vesicles, excluded the effects of external adsorption. The exchange rate of histones across the nuclear envelope is strongly depressed in the presence of GTP and GDP. The vesicles contain the translocation mechanism for poly(A)-containing RNA. The translocation of poly(A), messenger RNA, and ribosomal RNA was investigated after entrapment of these nucleic acids during the preparation of vesicles. Our data show that the complete export of only poly(A)-containing RNA from the vesicles is enhanced in the presence of 2 mM ATP. This RNA, as well as poly(A), is transported unidirectionally.\r"

Ten amino acids, constant within each species for thymopoietin and splenin, differ between the human and bovine polypeptides. The pentapeptide active site of thymopoietin (residues 32-36) is constant between the human and bovine thymopoietins, but position 34 in the active site of splenin has changed from glutamic acid in bovine splenin to alanine in human splenin, accounting for the biological activity of the human but not the bovine splenin on the human T-cell line MOLT-4.\r"

Both inducers effect transcriptional changes within 10 min after treatment and are maximal after 30 min for forskolin and after 60 min for dexamethasone. The 5' flanking sequences of the TH gene were fused to the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and the hybrid gene was transfected into pheochromocytoma cultures and GH4 pituitary cells. In both cell lines, a region of the TH gene containing bases -272 to +27 conferred induction of CAT by cyclic AMP, but not by glucocorticoid. The same results were found when a region of the TH gene containing -773 to +27 was used. Thus, the sequences required for induction of TH by cyclic AMP are contained within 272 bases of 5' flanking sequence, but sequences sufficient for glucocorticoid regulation are not contained within 773 bases.\r"

This proteoglycan inhibits the thromboplastin-activated pathway of coagulation; as a consequence, the catalytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is arrested. Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), an enzyme with specificity restricted to the heparan sulfate portion of the polysaccharide, releases fragments with the electrophoretic mobility and the structure of heparin. Conversely, an assessment of the size and distribution of the heparan sulfate regions has been provided by the use of heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), which, by degrading the heparin sections of the chain, releases two segments that exhibit the structure of heparan sulfate. One of these segments is attached to the protein core. On the basis of these findings, the heparan sulfate chain can be defined as a copolymer containing heparin regions in its structure. The combined use of these enzymes has made it possible to establish the disaccharide sequence of parts of the glycosaminoglycan moiety of this proteoglycan.\r"

Derivatization of the ligands with N-[4-(p-azido-m-[125I]iodophenylazo) benzoyl]-3-aminopropyl-N'-oxysuccinimide ester (Denny-Jaffe reagent) reduced their binding to platelets by greater than or equal to 20%. Cleavage of the azo linkage of the Denny-Jaffe reagent, which splits the molecule so that its 125I-labeled portion becomes associated with the receptor half of the cross-linked ligand-receptor complex, was utilized to directly identify receptors for the various immunoglobulin ligands. Specificity of the binding reaction could be demonstrated by suppressing the iodination of the receptors with excess nonderivatized ligand. Two principal IgG-related receptors could be identified by high-resolution NaDodSO4/PAGE and subsequent analysis of the electrophoretically transferred peptides to nitrocellulose filters for localization of radioactivity and immunological characterization. Intact monomeric IgG and F(ab')2 fragments derived from it appeared to have the glycoprotein IIIa as the major receptor, whereas Fc fragments bound predominantly to a peptide of Mr approximately 200,000 (Mr, approximately 50,000 under rigorous reducing conditions).\r"

Both TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 fractions are required for in vitro transcription of the VA1 gene. In DNase I \"footprinting\" experiments, the TFIIIC2 fraction protects the internal control region termed the B block. Addition of the TFIIIC1 fraction extends the footprint over the internal control region called the A block. TFIIIC1 activity is the limiting transcription factor activity required for VA1 transcription in the crude extract. TFIIIC2 activity sediments as a large component of approximately 18 S, while TFIIIC1 activity sediments at approximately 9 S. These data indicate that the two activities are unique components and when added together reconstitute TFIIIC activity.\r"

Scatchard analysis of the alpha-inhibin-92 binding data indicated the presence of high-affinity binding sites (1.35 nM/mg of membrane protein) with an apparent Kd of 0.37 nM. When 125I-labeled alpha-inhibin-92 was covalently crosslinked to the pituitary membrane preparation with disuccinimidyl suberate and the solubilized labeled receptor complex was analyzed by NaDodSO4/PAGE under either reducing or nonreducing conditions, a single radioactive band at an apparent molecular weight of 90,000 +/- 5000 was observed.

The mechanism, which we call polymer-guided diffusion, involves a microscopic cycle of polymer association and dissociation from a lateral binding site. Reassociation occurs at the polymer subunit adjacent to that which has just dissociated, thus generating an apparent sliding movement. The displacement involves only free diffusion and the spontaneous fluctuations of the polymer; the movement thus requires no other energy sources than thermal energy and the energy originally required for the formation of the polymer. In this manner polymer-associated organelles can be guided (inevitably) by diffusional processes toward a final destination. The specific example of the anaphase movement of chromosomes poleward is detailed.\r"

After phosphorylation the 48-kDa protein is no longer recovered as a component of the cytoskeletal fraction but is present as a fully soluble phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa protein (probably myosin light chains) signals a proteolytic conversion, catalyzed by calpain, to a smaller species having a molecular mass of approximately 15 kDa. Phosphorylation of both the 48- and 20-kDa proteins is related to the conversion of protein kinase C, also catalyzed by calpain, to the soluble fully active form. Leupeptin, an inhibitor of calpain, blocks both the phosphorylation of the target proteins and the proteolytic modification of the 20-kDa polypeptide. Thus, phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins and signal-directed proteolysis appear to be related processes that follow stimulation of human neutrophils by phorbol esters. The resulting changes in cytoskeletal organization may be involved in the expression of some neutrophil functions, such as exocytosis of specific granules.\r"

DNase I protection studies revealed at least six different regions within the 277-base-pair (bp) promoter that bind nuclear proteins and produce \"footprints.\" The functional significance of these sequences was determined through transcriptional analysis of a series of substitution mutations that scrambled short sequences throughout this region. Two of the footprint sequences were crucial for transcription in vitro; one of these contains a match in 6 of 6 bp, with a sequence in the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter that is known to be required for transcription. Scrambling a 26-bp sequence in a third footprint led to a consistent 2-fold increase in transcription, suggesting that this sequence might be a site for negative regulation. These studies define three regions that play a role in regulating transcription of the gene for HMG-CoA reductase, a negatively regulated enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.\r"

  ".U": "87231871\r", 
  ".W": "Extracts from bovine pituitary were found to contain an activity catalyzing the conversion of glutaminyl peptides such as [Gln1]gonadotropin-releasing hormone, [Gln1, Gly4]thyrotropin-releasing hormone (H-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-OH), and H-Gln-Tyr-Ala-OH to the respective pyroglutamyl peptides. The TRH precursor fragment H-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-OH and the D-glutaminyl stereoisomer of H-Gln-Tyr-Ala-OH did not react under the same conditions. The conversion products were identified by Edman degradation, amino acid analysis, and reversed-phase HPLC. That this activity was exhibited by an enzyme, glutaminyl cyclase, was concluded from the protein character of the activity (revealed by its abolition with trypsin and heat), the Michaelis-Menten relationship between substrate concentration and conversion rate, and the substrate specificity. It was determined that glutaminyl cyclase had a molecular weight of 43,000-50,000, a pH optimum at pH 8, and Km and Vmax values in the range of 60-130 microM and 390-690 pmol/microgram per hr, respectively. Glutaminyl cyclase was not observed to require ATP and could be inhibited with 1.0 M ammonium chloride, which increased the Km and decreased the Vmax value. The subcellular distribution of glutaminyl cyclase corresponded to the one of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase believed to catalyze C-terminal amidations during posttranslational precursor processing. It was also observed that the formation of pyroglutamyl from glutaminyl peptides occurred nonenzymatically; however, the enzymatic reaction carried out with crude extract was found to be approximately 70 times faster than the nonenzymatic reaction enhanced by phosphate. It is speculated that glutaminyl cyclase may participate in the posttranslational processing of hormonal precursors to pyroglutamyl peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the kinetics of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication in vitro demonstrated the existence of a slow presynthesis reaction that occurs prior to onset of extensive chain elongation and is dependent on a subset of the cellular proteins required for the complete replication reaction. When the presynthesis reaction is carried out in the presence of topoisomerase I, it is possible to detect extensive unwinding of the template DNA. This unwinding reaction is specific for templates that contain the wild-type SV40 origin of DNA replication and requires SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen), ATP, and a protein fraction derived from HeLa cells. The required cellular protein may be a eukaryotic single-stranded-DNA-binding protein (SSB), since unwinding of the template is also observed when Escherichia coli SSB is substituted for the HeLa protein fraction. These observations suggest that during the initial stages of SV40 DNA replication, T antigen binds specifically to the viral origin and locally unwinds the DNA. This origin-dependent unwinding reaction is presumably a prerequisite for subsequent priming and elongation steps.\r"

DNase I protection analysis was used to determine at the nucleotide level those enhancer sequences that interact with nuclear factors. At least nine sites of protein-DNA interaction were detected over approximately 400 base pairs of enhancer sequence. The regions of nuclease protection are associated with 21-, 19-, 18-, and 17-base-pair repeat elements as well as with a unique sequence, creating a large nucleoprotein complex. The relationship between the protein binding and the activity of the immediate early region 1 enhancer is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Since Jerne proposed a \"network\" theory of immune regulation, the properties of anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-IdAb) have been investigated widely. Anti-IdAb raised against antibodies to a variety of ligands have been shown to bind the ligands' receptors. Thus, the combining site of an anti-IdAb may contain information regarding the three-dimensional structure of an antigen. However, this remarkable property of \"internal imagery\" has not been exploited for structural investigation at the molecular level. In the present report, a monoclonal \"auto\"-anti-IdAb was raised against ganglioside GM1 (a cell-surface glycolipid that binds cholera toxin) and was shown to crossreact with the B subunit of cholera toxin. This antibody was presumed to recognize amino acid residues located within the GM1 binding domain. To identify these residues, the antibody was screened against homologous toxins purified from enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli and chimeric peptides produced by recombinant methods. Amino acid variation at position 4 from the N terminus of these proteins was found to disrupt antibody binding. Since the toxins and chimera are all closely related in structure and function, the residue at position 4 (an asparagine in cholera toxin B subunit) appears to be in the epitope of the antibody and, by implication, in the GM1 binding site. Of particular significance, this structural detail could not be deduced with GM1 alone. It would seem that ligand and anti-ligand anti-IdAb encode similar stereochemical information but do so with different \"chemical alphabets,\" giving rise to distinct binding specificities.\r"

Neither fructose nor mannose has a curbing effect on this mutant. Further addition of tunicamycin intensified the transport curb on the mutant mediated by glucose or allose. Mannose added to the parental cell line 023 seems able to mimic a glucose-mediated transport curb. In this line, but not the mutant, tunicamycin also intensifies a mannose-mediated curb. It seems that the tightening of the allose-mediated curb is a function of a specific type of transport regulation and perhaps too of interference with glycosylation of the hexose transporter. Furthermore, this type of curb can be strikingly reversed by shifting the cultures to medium containing fructose.\r"

Partially delipidated purple membrane, containing only 25% of the initial lipid phosphorus, could be converted to a blue form by acid titration but not by deionization. This reversible transition of delipidated membrane did not require the presence of other cations, and the pK of the color change that in native membrane under similar conditions is between 3.0 and 4.0 was shifted to 1.4. We conclude that the purple-to-blue transition is controlled by proton concentration only and that, in native membranes, the cations act only by raising the low surface pH generated by the acidic groups of the lipids. The observation that extraction of lipids from deionized native membrane converts its color from blue to purple further confirms this conclusion. The two states of the membrane probably reflect two preferred conformations of bacteriorhodopsin, which are controlled by protonation changes at the surface of the membrane and differ slightly in the spatial distribution of charges around the chromophore.\r"

Immature erythroid cells are obtained from the spleens of mice infected with the anemia strain of Friend virus. The binding of 125I-labeled Epo (125I-Epo) to plasma membranes from these cells was studied in this investigation. 125I-Epo binding reached equilibrium within 20 min at 37 degrees C. Twenty percent of the receptors bound 125I-Epo with a Kd of 0.08 X 10(-9) M, while the remaining receptors bound the hormone with a Kd of 0.6 X 10(-9) M. In this study, a receptor for Epo was identified by cross-linking 125I-Epo to the receptor in intact cells and plasma membrane preparations using disuccinimidyl suberate. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two labeled bands of 100 and 85 kDa. The 85-kDa band was more heavily labeled (65%) than the 100-kDa band. Both bands were equally decreased when increasing amounts of unlabeled Epo were included in the binding mixture, indicating a specific interaction of 125I-Epo with the receptor.\r"

Expression of the early JCV mRNA, which encodes the essential viral protein, large tumor antigen (T antigen), depends on recognition of the early enhancer/promoter elements by tissue-specific factors found in both human and rodent glial cells. In the presence of JCV T antigen, viral DNA replication requires a species-specific factor, presumably a component of DNA polymerase, which is found in a wide range of primate cells. We further demonstrate that simian virus 40 T antigen has sufficient homology to efficiently substitute for the analogous JCV protein in initiating viral DNA replication.\r"

This shift is inconsistent with a simple process of one bathorhodopsin (BathoR) intermediate being transformed into one lumirhodopsin (LumiR) intermediate on this time scale. The kinetics at 425 nm, 515 nm, and 575 nm could not be fit well to a single-exponential expression. The data are consistent with the existence of two forms of BathoR (BathoR1 and BathoR2) that exhibit different spectra and decay kinetics. The BathoR1 absorption maximum lies near 565 nm, and the BathoR1/LumiR1 isosbestic point is near 430 nm. The BathoR2 absorption maximum lies near 535 nm, and the BathoR2/LumiR2 isosbestic point is near 480 nm.

Quadrupolar echo and saturation recovery experiments were fitted by numerical solution of the stochastic Liouville equation, using a model that includes both inter- and intramolecular motions [Meier, P., Ohmes, E. & Kothe, G. (1986) J. Chem. Phys. 85, 3598-3614]. Combined simulations of both the relaxation times and the quadrupolar echo line shapes as a function of pulse spacing allowed unambiguous assignment of the various motional modes and a consistent interpretation of data from lipids labeled on the C-6, C-13, and C-14 positions of the sn-2 chain. In the fluid phase, the protein has little influence on either the chain order or the population of gauche rotational isomers but strongly retards the chain dynamics. For 1-myristoyl-2-[13-2H2] myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine at 35 degrees C, the correlation time for chain fluctuation increases from 20 nsec to 650 nsec and for chain rotation from 10 nsec to 180 nsec, and the gauche isomer lifetime increases from 0.15 nsec to 1.75 nsec, on going from the lipid alone to a recombinant of protein/lipid ratio 0.073 mol/mol. The results are essentially consistent with spin-label ESR studies on the same system [Brophy, P.J., Horvath, L.I. & Marsh, D.

Their assembly can be initiated in the near absence of transcription and protein synthesis from the four-cell stage, indicating the existence of preformed precursors. We have investigated the temporal control of this event, focusing on the possible involvement of the cytoskeleton, cell flattening, and cytokinesis. Embryos in various cleavage stages were treated with cytochalasins, to disrupt microfilaments and block cell flattening, cytokinesis, or both, or nocodazole, to promote microtubule depolymerization. To assess their capacity to initiate gap junction assembly after such treatments, the embryos were then aggregated with communication-competent, compacted embryos that had been labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Passage of the fluorescent dye, carboxyfluorescein, from labeled to unlabeled embryo was taken as evidence that interembryonic junction formation had occurred. The capacity to assemble gap junctions was acquired at the normal time by embryos prevented by cytochalasin treatment from undergoing cell flattening or any cytokinesis from fertilization onward. Likewise, treatment with nocodazole beginning in the four-cell or early eight-cell stage did not interfere with gap junction assembly. Neither drug affected the inability of four-cell embryos to assemble gap junctions prematurely. We conclude that intact microfilament or microtubule networks are not required for gap junction assembly in this system, nor do they restrain junctional precursors from assembling prematurely. Furthermore, the timing of gap junction assembly is not linked to cell flattening, cytokinesis, or cell number.\r"

PGF2 alpha provoked rapid (10 sec) and sustained (up to 60 min) increases in the levels of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (InsP, InsP2, and InsP3, respectively). InsP3 was formed more rapidly than InsP2 or InsP after PGF2 alpha treatment. In addition, PGF2 alpha increased inositol phospholipid turnover, as evidenced by increased 32PO4 incorporation into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol. LiCl (1-20 mM) enhanced inositol phosphate accumulation in response to PGF2 alpha. Maximal increases in InsP3 occurred at 1 microM PGF2 alpha, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 36 nM. The acute effects of PGF2 alpha on InsP3 levels were independent of reductions in extracellular calcium. Prostaglandins E1 and E2 also stimulated increases in inositol phosphate levels, albeit to a lesser extent. PGF2 alpha also induced rapid and concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i as measured by quin-2 fluorescence. The PGF2 alpha-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were maximal within 30 sec (approximately 2- to 3-fold), and [Ca2+]i remained elevated for 8-10 min. The PGF2 alpha-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were also independent of extracellular calcium. These findings demonstrate that the action of PGF2 alpha is coupled to the phospholipase C-InsP3 and diacylglycerol second messenger system in the corpus luteum.\r"

To localize the sorting information within these proteins, the polarity of secretion of truncated hemagglutinin and G glycoproteins secreted from confluent monolayers of MDCK cells transformed with vectors containing the corresponding truncated cDNAs was examined. It was found that, even though the transformed cells continued to secrete a major endogenous glycoprotein exclusively from the apical surface, the modified viral glycoproteins were secreted in a nonpolarized fashion from both sides of the monolayers. These observations suggest that important information for the sorting of the viral glycoprotein is contained within their membrane anchoring or cytoplasmic segments or that, if sorting signals are luminally located, these signals must be present in a conformation that is not attainable when the polypeptides are not attached to the membrane.\r"

A previous report described the isolation of clonal EC cell lines that express the integrated neomycin-resistance gene (neo) linked to the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR. The expression of the neo gene was explained by a cis-acting mechanism [Taketo, M., Gilboa, E. & Sherman, M. I. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 2422-2426]. From one such EC cell line, we isolated the flanking cellular sequence 5' to the proviral genome, ligated it to various test constructs, and transfected into the parental EC cells. The cellular sequence increased expression of the LTR-linked neo gene significantly, in a manner independent of its orientation and position. The neo mRNA was initiated at the bona fide promoter of the LTR. By deletion analyses, we defined a region of DNA essential for the enhancer activity and determined its sequence. This region contains distinctly characteristic stretches as well as some similarity to various viral and cellular enhancers. Thus the LTR-linked neo gene is expressed because the provirus is integrated in the vicinity of this enhancer that is active in undifferentiated EC cells.\r"

  ".W": "High density lipoprotein (HDL) is the major plasma lipoprotein found in mice fed normal laboratory chow containing 4% fat. When female mice from some inbred strains, such as C57BL/6, are fed a high fat diet (1.25% cholesterol, 15% fat, and 0.5% cholic acid), the levels of HDL-cholesterol decrease by about 50%, and lipid staining lesions form in the aorta within 14 weeks. In other strains of mice, such as C3H and BALB/c, HDL-lipid levels decrease only slightly, and few or no aortic lesions are observed at 14 weeks. The genetic basis of these phenotypic differences was analyzed by using recombinant inbred strains derived from C57BL/6 and BALB/c and also from C57BL/6 and C3H/He. The two phenotypes segregated as simple Mendelian traits, and no recombination was observed between them. Thus, HDL-cholesterol levels and susceptibility to atherosclerosis appear to be determined by the same gene (or by two closely linked genetic factors that are a maximum of 1.7 centimorgans apart). This gene was named Ath-1, for atherosclerosis susceptibility, with alleles r for resistance and s for susceptibility. Ath-1 maps on chromosome 1 near Alp-2, a gene that determines the structure of apolipoprotein A-II, one of the two major proteins found in HDL. Ath-1 is clearly separable from Alp-2, and the distance between these genes is 6.0 centimorgans with a standard error of 4.2 centimorgans. In humans, levels of HDL are inherited and are inversely correlated with atherosclerosis; familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia is associated with high levels of HDL-cholesterol and decreased risk of heart disease. The human trait phenotypically resembles Ath-1 in the mouse.\r"

  ".W": "The aging process has been dissected by analysis of genetic variants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Long-lived recombinant inbred lines were generated; some of these lines have mean and maximum life spans up to 70% longer than wild type. Longer life results from a slowing of the characteristic exponential increase in mortality rate that is typical of aging populations in all species. The length of developmental periods and the length of the reproductive period are unrelated to increased life span. Lengthened life is due entirely to an increase in postreproductive life span. Development, reproduction, and life span are each under independent genetic control. General motor activity decays linearly with chronological age in all genotypes. The decay in general motor activity is correlated with and a predictor of life span, suggesting that both share at least one common rate-determining component.\r"

  ".W": "The role of UV radiation-induced photoproducts in initiating base substitution mutations in human cells was examined by measuring photoproduct frequency distributions and mutations in a supF tRNA gene on a shuttle vector plasmid transfected into DNA repair-deficient cells (xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A) and into normal cells. Frequencies of cyclobutane dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts varied by as much as 80-fold at different dipyrimidine sites within the gene. All transition mutations occurred at dipyrimidine sites, predominantly at cytosine, with a 17-fold variation in mutation frequency between different sites. Removal of greater than 99% of the cyclobutane dimers by in vitro photoreactivation before transfection reduced the mutation frequency while preserving the mutation distribution, indicating that (i) cytosine-containing cyclobutane dimers were the major mutagenic lesions at these sites and (ii) cytosine-containing non-cyclobutane dimer photoproducts were also mutagenic lesions. However, at individual dipyrimidine sites neither the frequency of cyclobutane dimers nor the frequency of pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts correlated with the mutation frequency, even in the absence of excision repair. Mutation hot spots occurred at sites with low or high frequency of photoproduct formation and mutation cold spots occurred at sites with many photoproducts. These results suggest that although photoproducts are required for UV mutagenesis, the prominence of most mutation hot spots and cold spots is primarily determined by DNA structural features rather than by the frequency of DNA photoproducts.\r"

In infected humans no antibody mediating ACC was observed regardless of the status of disease. Even healthy individuals with high-titer, broadly reactive, neutralizing antibodies had no ACC. In contrast, chimpanzees infected with HTLV-IIIb, from whom virus could be isolated, not only had neutralizing antibody but also antibodies broadly reactive in ACC, even against distantly related human immunodeficiency virus isolates, as well as against their own reisolated virus. In the goat, the gp120 of HTLV-IIIb induced a highly type-specific response as measured by both ACC and flow cytofluorometry of live infected H9 cells. Normal human cells were not subject to ACC by animal anti-HTLV-III gp120-specific sera. Induction of ACC and neutralizing antibody were closely correlated in the animal experimental models but not in humans. The presence of ACC in gp120-inoculated goats and HTLV-III-infected chimpanzees represents a qualitative difference that may be important in the quest for the elicitation of a protective immunity in humans.\r"

We report herein four infants who had an HIV infection in association with severe hypogammaglobulinemia and did not exhibit antibodies against HIV. HIV was isolated antemortem or postmortem in all four infants from either peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or body tissues. HIV infection could be presumed to be acquired transplacentally in two infants and by way of infected blood transfusions during the neonatal period in the other two. Each infant became symptomatic within the first year of life and developed rapidly progressive manifestations of the disease. Features that were common to all four infants include premature birth, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and progressive neurological abnormalities that were associated with intracranial calcifications. We concluded that, when infection occurs early in development either by transplacental exposure to the virus or from blood transfusion in small premature infants, hypogammaglobulinemia and deficiency of antibody production leading to the absence of antibody responses on which diagnosis is usually based can occur. Furthermore, progressive central nervous system disease may be a frequent finding in such infants, and this may lead to cerebral calcifications that must be attributed to the HIV infection itself and not to complicating infections--e.g., toxoplasmosis. It is suggested that patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, antibody deficiency syndrome, and central nervous system disease have an extremely bad prognosis.\r"

  ".U": "87231918\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown that the autosomal recessive mutation, gray tremor (gt) was associated in the homozygous state (gt/gt) with a rapidly fatal spongiform encephalopathy. Heterozygotes (+/gt) developed mild asymptomatic spongiform brain lesions as did recipient inbred mice inoculated with gt/gt brain homogenates, some of whom also showed behavioral abnormalities [Sidman, R. L., Kinney, H. C. & Sweet, H. O. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 253-257]. In these studies, inbred NFS/N mice inoculated intracerebrally at birth or as adults with gt/gt or first passage gt brain homogenates developed a progressive disease characterized by tremor, ataxia, and spasticity. The symptoms were milder and more slowly progressive than in the gt/gt homozygote, in the paralytic syndrome that followed neonatal inoculation of NFS/N mice with a wild murine leukemia virus (Cas-Br-M MuLV), or in the rapidly progressive ataxia and terminal bradykinesia that followed scrapie inoculation of NFS/N mice. The noninflammatory spongiform encephalopathy in affected NFS/N mice resembled that observed in gt/gt homozygotes, +/gt heterozygotes, and asymptomatic recipient inbred mice inoculated with gt/gt brain homogenates. Neither infectious MuLV nor MuLV proteins were detected in gt/gt brain homogenates or in affected recipient mouse brains. Scrapie-associated fibrils, readily identifiable in subcellular fractions of brains from scrapie-inoculated NFS/N mice, were not detected in similar brain fractions from NFS/N mice inoculated with gt brain homogenates. These results confirm and extend the suggestion that gt spongiform encephalopathy has both heritable and transmissible properties. Moreover, the transmissible agent of gt disease differs from both Cas-Br-M MuLV and scrapie in its disease-inducing properties in NFS/N mice. The capacity of NFS/N mice to express transmitted gt encephalopathy as clinical disease, to rapidly express Cas-Br-M MuLV spongiform encephalomyelopathy, and to develop mouse-adapted scrapie after a very short incubation time suggest a distinct sensitivity of NFS/N mice to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.\r"

By contrast, HIV antigen, whether free or complexed, was detected in CSF from only 1 of 18 HIV antibody seropositive patients without progressive encephalopathy and from 0 of 8 experimentally infected chimpanzees without clinical signs. Intra-blood-brain barrier synthesis of HIV-specific antibody was demonstrated in the majority of patients with AIDS (9/12) or at risk for AIDS (8/13) as well as in the experimentally infected chimpanzees, indicating HIV-specific B-cell reactivity in the brain without apparent neurological signs. In 6 of 11 patients with HIV infection, antibodies synthesized in the central nervous system were directed against HIV envelope proteins. Active viral expression appears to be necessary for both the immunodeficiency and progressive encephalopathy associated with HIV infection.\r"

In 40 min, greater than 80% of the immunoreactive material was found as a higher molecular weight species, consistent with stoichiometric covalent complex formation. In a two-stage chromogenic thrombin inactivation assay, under pseudo-first-order conditions, at 16 nM antithrombin III the t1/2 was 74 min and 50 min for plasma and COS cell-derived antithrombin III, respectively, in the absence of heparin.

Substantial staining was also found throughout the inner plexiform layer and in select cells in the inner nuclear layer. Adenosine A1 receptors, labeled with the agonists L-[3H]phenylisopropyladenosine and 125I-labeled hydroxy-phenylisopropyladenosine, were autoradiographically localized. The highest levels of binding sites occurred in the nerve fiber, ganglion cell, and inner plexiform layers of the retina in all the species examined. The distribution of adenosine A1 receptor sites closely parallels that of retinal neurons and fibers containing immunoreactive adenosine. These results suggest a role for endogenous adenosine as a coneurotransmitter in ganglion cells and their fibers in the optic nerve.\r"

The specific binding of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin is stable, saturable, and reversible. Saturation experiments indicated that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin labeled a single class of sites with an affinity constant (Kd) of 434 +/- 56 pM and a total number of binding sites (Bmax) of 74.0 +/- 13.6 fmol/mg of protein. The affinity constant obtained from kinetic analysis was in close agreement with that obtained in saturation experiments. Competition experiments showed a monophasic reduction of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding with a pharmacological order of indole amine affinities characteristic of a melatonin receptor: 2-iodomelatonin greater than 6-chloromelatonin greater than or equal to melatonin greater than or equal to 6,7-dichloro-2-methylmelatonin greater than 6-hydroxymelatonin greater than or equal to 6-methoxymelatonin much greater than N-acetyltryptamine greater than N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than 5-hydroxytryptamine (inactive). The affinities of these melatonin analogs in competing for 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites were correlated closely with their potencies for inhibition of the calcium-dependent release of [3H]dopamine from chicken and rabbit retinas, indicating association of the binding site with a functional response regulated by melatonin. The results indicate that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin is a selective, high-affinity radioligand for the identification and characterization of melatonin receptor sites.\r"

After recording, Lucifer yellow was injected into the cells to verify their localization within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (dmnX). In the rat, virtually all neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dmnX increased their rate of firing in the presence of 10-1000 nM oxytocin and their membrane depolarized in a reversible concentration-dependent manner. This excitation was probably exerted directly on the impaled cells rather than being synaptically mediated, since it persisted in a low calcium/high magnesium medium or in the presence of tetrodotoxin. These data provide evidence for a direct membrane effect of oxytocin on a defined population of neurons in the rat brain. In the guinea pig, vagal neurons were fired by glutamate but were not excited by oxytocin, even though we detected many more oxytocin-immunoreactive structures in the guinea pig dmnX than in the rat dmnX. Therefore, homologous nuclei in the brains of two closely related mammals differ markedly in the density of oxytocinergic axons they contain. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of the electrophysiological effects of oxytocin on vagal neurons appeared inversely related to the amount of oxytocin-like immunoreactivity present in dmnX.\r"

This defect is corrected fully by the microinjection of wild-type Paramecium calmodulin into pantophobiac A cells and is partially restored by calmodulins from other organisms, but it cannot be restored by microinjection of pantophobiac calmodulin. Overall, these results suggested that wild-type Paramecium calmodulin has unique features that allow it to restore fully a normal phenotype and that the defect in pantophobiac A might be an altered calmodulin molecule. Previous studies established the amino acid sequence of wild-type calmodulin and showed that Paramecium calmodulin has several differences from other calmodulins, including the presence of dimethyllysine at residue 13. To test directly the possibility that calmodulin from the pantophobiac mutant might be altered, we purified the mutant calmodulin and compared its properties to those of wild-type Paramecium calmodulin. We found one amino acid sequence difference between the two Paramecium calmodulins: a phenylalanine in the mutant protein, instead of a serine, at residue 101. This change is at a calcium-liganding residue in the third calcium-binding loop. These and previous studies demonstrate that comparatively subtle changes in the structure of calmodulin can result in quantitative alterations in in vivo activity, provide insight into the in vivo roles of calmodulin and the regulation of ion channels, and demonstrate that functional alterations of calmodulin are not necessarily lethal.\r"

  ".W": "The Ca2+ current of single ventricular cells perfused internally by the suction-pipette method can be increased (\"potentiated\") progressively with repeated stimulation. In Na+- and K+-free external solution containing Ca+, the potentiation response begins to appear at a step potential to -20 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV, reaching a maximum at 0-10 mV. Thus, maximal potentiation coincides with peak inward Ca2+ current. The time course of potentiation development and decline is very slow, occurring in seconds; the former is voltage-dependent, whereas the latter is not. Concomitant with the peak current increase, current decay during the pulse is slowed markedly, thus resulting in the persistence of significant Ca2+ influx at the end of the pulse. With nonperfused single cells, a similar stimulation protocol elicits a similar increase in cell contractility. It is concluded that the Ca2+ channel, after being opened by a single step depolarization, can be opened further by repeating the same step at an appropriate frequency. This additional channel opening is likely to be responsible for the generation of the positive force \"staircase\" of the myocardial cells in response to increased heart rate.\r"

Maximal levels of expression were achieved with 6.5 kb of 5' flanking sequence adjacent to the proximal promoter sequences or when a distal enhancer element with both position- and orientation-independent function was moved proximal to the promoter.

Each of these elements was predicted to be encompassed within a 110-residue segment that is highly conserved between the two T antigens residues 418-528 in SV40 T antigen and residues 565-675 in PyV). Results of biochemical and immunologic experiments on the nucleotide binding behavior of these proteins were found to be consistent with these predictions. Taken together, the latter have resulted in a topological model of the ATP binding site in these two oncogene products.\r"

The inhibition by Cl- does not occur in the presence of concentrations of epsilon Ahx that saturate the acid's weak binding sites on [Glu1]Pg, and the stimulation by epsilon Ahx is maximally exhibited in the presence of Cl-. We have used intrinsic fluorescence measurements with [Glu1]Pg to show that the conformational alteration and the concomitant increase in activation rate that accompanies epsilon Ahx-binding to [Glu1]Pg in the presence of Cl- does not occur in the same manner without Cl-. Further, the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence that is attendant to Cl- binding to [Glu1]Pg in the absence of epsilon Ahx is not observed in the presence of this effector molecule. Analyses of the results of this manuscript strongly indicate that a conformation of [Glu1]Pg that is not optimal for its activation by urokinase is adopted in the presence of Cl-, and this is relieved by epsilon Ahx. This has important implications in the inhibition of [Glu1]Pg activation in the solution phase of blood plasma and in the large acceleration of this process when plasminogen is bound to physiological positive effectors via its epsilon Ahx-binding site(s).\r"

  ".U": "87231947\r", 
  ".W": "Type IX collagen represents 5-20% of the total collagen in hyaline cartilage. The molecules of this collagen are composed of three genetically distinct polypeptide subunits. One of these subunits, alpha 2(IX), contains covalently bound glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate). We report here on the structure of the glycosaminoglycan attachment site of type IX collagen-proteoglycan. We show, by a combination of cDNA and peptide sequencing, that the attachment region contains the sequence Gly-Ser-Ala-Asp, located within the noncollagenous domain NC3 of the alpha 2(IX) chain. By comparing the exons encoding the NC3 domain in the alpha 2(IX) and alpha 1(IX) genes, we find that the exon coding for the glycosaminoglycan attachment site in the alpha 2(IX) gene is 48 base pairs long, whereas the homologous alpha 1(IX) exon is 33 base pairs. The NC3 domain is, therefore, five amino acid residues longer in alpha 2(IX) than in alpha 1(IX). The extra sequence in alpha 2(IX), Val-Glu-Gly-Ser-Ala, provides a simple explanation for the kink observed at the NC3 domain of type IX molecules when examined by electron microscopy. The inserted block of amino acid residues also provides the NC3 domain of alpha 2(IX) chains with a serine residue, not present in alpha 1(IX) that serves as attachment site for a glycosaminoglycan side chain. Our data show that the amino acid sequence that surrounds the glycosylated serine residue in type IX collagen-proteoglycan differs from glycosylated sequences in noncollagenous core proteins. The data also provide strong evidence that glycosylation of type IX collagen is not a chance glycosylation of a serine residue in a noncollagenous domain, but is a specific post-translational modification of this unusual collagen molecule.\r"

Murine and human cells infected with each of the resulting infectious recombinant viruses efficiently expressed their respective P-450 proteins. The newly synthesized protein products are translocated into the microsomes, and their characterization by immunochemical analysis indicates that the sizes of the polypeptides expressed were indistinguishable from their cytochrome P-450 counterparts found in mammalian liver microsomes. Functional analysis of each of the proteins by spectral and enzymatic analysis indicates that the expressed proteins have incorporated heme, and the holoenzymes displayed catalytic activities characteristic of their respective cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Thus, this system can be used to produce properly processed and catalytically active P-450 gene products in a wide variety of cells. The remarkable fidelity of expression and processing of these enzymes suggests that the vaccinia virus recombinants can be used for a wide variety of studies, including analysis of the effects of defined mutations produced in vitro, and directly correlate the structure/activity relationships of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes.\r"

Measurements on a series of glucagon/secretin hybrids indicated that replacement of Asp9 in glucagon by Glu9, found in secretin, was the important sequence difference in the N terminus of the two hormones. Further deletion of His1 and introduction of a C-terminal amide resulted in des-His1-[Glu9]glucagon amide, which had a 40% binding affinity relative to that of native glucagon but caused no detectable adenylate cyclase activation in the rat liver membrane. This antagonist completely inhibited the effect of a concentration of glucagon that alone gave a full agonist response. It had an inhibition index of 12. The pA2 was 7.2. An attempt was made to relate conformation with receptor binding. The peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods and purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on C18-silica columns.\r"

Monolayers were formed by continuously adding a solution of phospholipid [dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine in hexane/ethanol, 9:1 (vol/vol)] to the air/water interface of a constant-area trough. This procedure generates unconventional surface pressure (pi)-surface concentration (gamma) isotherms, which for liquid-crystalline monolayers consist of straight lines with three prominent intersections, two of which are not apparent in conventional pi-A isotherms. The regions of linear change of pi are explicable in terms of the area dependence of alkyl chain entropy. The two breaks at lower pi delimit states in which both chains lie parallel to the surface. The third occurs at collapse, which corresponds to a true equilibrium for unstressed liposomes. Mechanical and thermodynamic properties of bilayers, particularly phase-transition parameters, correspond closely to those of monolayers with which they are in equilibrium.\r"

  ".W": "The use of deuterium oxide (2H2O) is proposed as a freely diffusible nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) blood flow and tissue perfusion tracer of potential clinical utility. Deuterium is a stable, nonradiative isotope commercially available as 2H2O at enrichment levels of essentially 100%--i.e., 110 molar equivalent deuterium. This high concentration, together with the short relaxation time of the spin 1 (quadrupole) deuterium nuclide, provides substantial sensitivity for NMR spectroscopy. As a result, when 2H2O is administered in a bolus fashion to a specific tissue or organ in vivo, the deuterium NMR intensity time course can be analyzed, using mathematical models developed by others for radiolabeled tracers, to measure the rate of blood flow and tissue perfusion. Such an application is demonstrated herein at a static magnetic field of 8.5 tesla. Using single-compartment flow modeling, hepatic blood flow and tissue perfusion in fasted (18 hr) male Sprague-Dawley rats was determined to be 61 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) ml/100 g per min (n = 5).\r"

We designed and used a scattered-light-collecting device, which corrects CD spectra for optical artifacts originating from light scattering. Relative contents of eight types of secondary structure were estimated by using basis spectra generated by the eigenvector method based on CD spectra of 15 proteins of known structure. Results indicate that the glucose transporter is composed of approximately 82% alpha-helices, 10% beta-turns, and 8% other random structure, with no beta-strands. In the presence of an excess of D-glucose, the alpha-helical content is reduced by more than 10% and there is a significant increase in the random structure content. Cytochalasin B does not appear to affect the secondary structural composition of the transporter to any significant degree.\r"

Dynamic observations have shown that stable processes are formed from partially retracted lamellas and from contracted tail parts of cell bodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy of platinum replicas of cytoskeleton have shown that PMA-induced narrow processes are rich in microtubules and intermediate filaments but relatively poor in actin microfilaments; in contrast, lamellas and cell bodies contained numerous microfilaments. Colcemid-induced depolymerization of microtubules led to contraction of PMA-induced processes; cytochalasin B prevented this contraction. It is suggested that PMA-induced separation of cell into motile and stable parts is due to directional movement of actin structures along the microtubular framework. Similar movements may play an important role in various normal morphogenetic processes.\r"

About 75% of erythroid colony-forming precursor cell-like colonies derived from SKT6 cells were hemoglobin-positive after 3- to 4-day exposure to Epo in methylcellulose culture. Radioiodinated Epo bound specifically to SKT6 cells, and Scatchard analysis of the data showed a high affinity for 125I-Epo (Kd = 0.15 nM) but displayed only a small number of specific receptors (approximately equal to 470 per cell). Membrane components that specifically interact with 125I-Epo were identified by covalent crosslinking with disuccinimidyl suberate, and three receptor species with apparent Mr 63,000, 94,000, and 119,000 were found in membrane from SKT6 cells, suggesting the complex structure of the receptor molecules. Specific bindings were also detected in all of the Epo-unresponsive Friend erythroleukemia cells examined, and cross-linking study revealed the presence of only the 63,000 species as a binding site.\r"

  ".W": "Some freshwater turtles appear unable to produce eggs large enough to achieve the balance between size and number of eggs predicted by optimal egg size theory. We present evidence that pelvic girdle structure constrains egg size and thus offspring size in females of smaller-bodied species (Chrysemys picta and Deirochelys reticularia). The constraint is demonstrated by the correspondence of slopes of the increase of the pelvic aperture and egg width with increasing body size. This constraint appears to be relaxed in a larger-bodied species (Pseudemys scripta), in which the increase in pelvic aperture relative to body size is greater than the increase in egg width. This type of structural constraint on a reproductive trait should not occur unless there is strong selection on pelvic architecture for other functions, such as locomotion, support, and limb retraction, that prevent expansion of the pelvic aperture. Although other explanations may exist for other groups of organisms that appear to vary egg size, the large variation in egg size associated with body size in some species of turtles can be reconciled with optimal egg size theory only if a pelvic constraint model is accepted.\r"

Screening of subclones from selected pools of human-mouse hybrids facilitated the identification of hybrids containing a single neo-tagged human chromosome. Transfer of this chromosome to XP-A cells (but not to XP-F or XP-C cells) results in enhanced resistance to ultraviolet light and enhanced excision repair capacity.

Integration of the neo gene into individual human chromosomes and expression of the gene were demonstrated by Southern blot analyses, microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, and chromosome analyses. The stability of the integrated neo gene in the transformants was shown by a comparative growth assay in selective and nonselective media. Transformation and incorporation of the neo gene into the host genome occurred at a frequency of 8 X 10(-4)-3 X 10(-3).

Tumor imaging was initially obscured by circulating 125I-labeled TA99 during the first 6 days after antibody injection. With clearance of 125I-labeled TA99 from the blood (half-life, 4-7 days), specific tumor images could be clearly defined by day 13. Due to the persistence of 125I-labeled TA99 at the tumor site (8.9% of the injected dose at 1 week and 4.6% at 8-10 weeks), images were obtainable for up to 10 weeks. At 8-10 weeks, the tumor/blood ratio was 10(4)-10(5), and the tumor/normal tissue ratio ranged from 10(2) to 10(5).

  ".W": "Much effort has been devoted to the analysis of antibodies to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus antigens, but no studies, to our knowledge, have defined antigenic sites of this virus that elicit T-cell immunity, even though such immunity is important in protection against many other viruses. T cells tend to recognize only a limited number of discrete sites on a protein antigen. Analysis of immunodominant helper T-cell sites has suggested that such sites tend to form amphipathic helices. An algorithm based on this model was used to identify two candidate T-cell sites, env T1 and env T2, in the envelope protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB that were conserved in other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and studied in genetically defined inbred and F1 mice for induction of lymph node proliferation. After immunization with a 426-residue recombinant envelope protein fragment, significant responses to native gp 120, as well as to each peptide, were observed in both F1 combinations studied. Conversely, immunization with env T1 peptide induced T-cell immunity to the native gp 120 envelope protein. The genetics of the response to env T1 peptide were further examined and revealed a significant response in three of four independent major histocompatibility haplotypes tested, an indication of high frequency responsiveness in the population. Identification of helper T-cell sites should facilitate development of a highly immunogenic, carrier-free vaccine that induces T-cell and B-cell immunity. The ability to elicit T-cell immunity to the native viral protein by immunization with a 16-residue peptide suggests that such sites represent potentially important components of an effective vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "87231985\r", 
  ".W": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) prolongs survival in the twitcher mouse, an authentic animal model of human globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease; galactosylceramidase deficiency), but the effects of HCT on levels of galactosylceramidase, psychosine, and cerebrosides in the tissues of twitcher mice have not been previously studied. Galactosylceramidase was less than 8% of control activity in tissues of untreated twitcher mice but reached normal values in brain and spleen and 20-30% of control in kidney of 100-day-old twitchers that received HCT at age 10 days. Using a recently developed method for the simultaneous determination of psychosine and cerebrosides, we measured the tissue levels of these lipids in the above animals. The levels of psychosine in brain, sciatic nerve, and kidney of untreated twitcher mice were 44, 200, and 12 times control values, respectively, in 30-day-old animals and 69, 500, and 14 times control levels in 40-day-old mice. On the other hand, levels of cerebroside were approximately 35% of control values in sciatic nerve, remained about the same in the brain, and were elevated 10-fold in the kidney of twitcher mice. After HCT, psychosine levels in the brains of 30-day-old twitchers were lowered to 30-35% of values in untreated twitchers, and the levels remained in that range during the post-HCT period. Similarly, brain cerebroside levels remained low in HCT-treated twitcher mice. Although psychosine levels in sciatic nerves of HCT-treated twitcher mice increased more slowly than in the nerves of untreated twitchers, the levels in 100-day-old HCT-treated twitcher mice had reached the same high values as those seen in untreated 40-day-old twitchers. It is not known whether the extremely high levels of psychosine in sciatic nerves ultimately contribute to the death of twitcher mice after HCT.\r"

We have used localization techniques based on the rotating-frame imaging experiment and carried out with a double-surface coil probe. Information is obtained from selected slices by rotating-frame depth selection and from a complete one-dimensional spectroscopic image using phase-modulated rotating-frame imaging. The methods collect biochemical information from metabolites in human heart, and we use the fact that the phosphocreatine/ATP molar ratio in skeletal muscle at rest is higher than that in working heart to demonstrate that localization has been achieved for each investigation. The phosphocreatine/ATP molar ratio in normal human heart has been measured as 1.55 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD) (3.5-sec interpulse delay) in six subjects using depth selection and as 1.53 +/- 0.25 (mean +/- SD) in four subjects using spectroscopic imaging. Measurement of this ratio is expected to give a useful and reproducible index of myocardial energetics in normal and pathological states.\r"

  ".U": "87231995\r", 
  ".W": "Highly specific radioligands and quantitative autoradiography reveal strikingly different neuroanatomical patterns for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors of rat brain. The mu receptors are most densely localized in patches in the striatum, layers I and III of the cortex, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal formation, specific nuclei of the thalamus, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the locus coeruleus. In contrast, delta receptors are highly confined, exhibiting selective localization in layers I, II, and VIa of the neocortex, a diffuse pattern in the striatum, and moderate concentration in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and in the interpeduncular nucleus. delta receptors are absent in most other brain structures. This distribution is unexpected in that the enkephalins, the putative endogenous ligands of the delta receptor, occur essentially throughout the brain. The kappa receptors of rat brain exhibit a third pattern distinct from that of the mu and delta receptors. kappa receptors occur at low density in patches in the striatum and at particularly high density in the nucleus accumbens, along the pyramidal and molecular layers of the hippocampus, in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus, specific midline nuclei of the thalamus, and hindbrain regions. kappa receptors appear to be uniformly distributed across regions in the neocortex with the exception of layer III, which revealed only trace levels of binding. An important conclusion of the present study is that delta receptors occur at high density only in the forebrain and in two midbrain structures, whereas mu and kappa receptors exhibit discrete patterns in most major brain regions.\r"

  ".U": "87231996\r", 
  ".W": "Sympathetic neurons dissociated from the superior cervical ganglion of 2-day-old rats were studied by whole-cell patch clamp and by fura-2 measurements of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i. Step depolarizations in the presence of tetrodotoxin and hexamethonium triggered two Ca2+ currents that differed in the voltage dependence of activation and kinetics of inactivation. These currents resemble the L and N currents previously described in chicken sensory neurons [Nowycky, M. C., Fox, A. P. & Tsien, R. W. (1985) Nature (London) 316, 440-442]. Treatment with acetylcholine resulted in the rapid (within seconds), selective, and reversible inhibition of the rapidly inactivated, N-type current, whereas the long-lasting L-type current remained unaffected. The high sensitivity to blocker drugs (atropine, pirenzepine) indicated that this effect of acetylcholine was due to a muscarinic M1 receptor. Intracellular perfusion with nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogs or pretreatment of the neurons with pertussis toxin had profound effects on the Ca2+ current modulation. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate caused the disappearance of the N-type current (an effect akin to that of acetylcholine, but irreversible), whereas guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate and pertussis toxin pretreatment prevented the acetylcholine-induced inhibition. In contrast, cAMP, applied intracellularly together with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as well as activators and inhibitors of protein kinase C, were without effect. Acetylcholine caused shortening of action potentials in neurons treated with tetraethylammonium to partially block K+ channels. Moreover, when applied to neurons loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura-2, acetylcholine failed to appreciably modify [Ca2+]i at rest but caused a partial blunting of the initial [Ca2+]i peak induced by depolarization with high K+. This effect was blocked by muscarinic antagonists and pertussis toxin and was unaffected by protein kinase activators. Thus, muscarinic modulation of the N-type Ca2+ channels appears to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein and independent of both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C.\r"

In neonatal rat, a transient, dense, serotonergic innervation appears in all primary sensory areas of cortex. In somatosensory cortex, dense patches of serotonergic innervation are aligned with specialized cellular aggregates called barrels. The dense patches are not apparent after 3 weeks of age, and the serotonergic innervation becomes more uniform in adult neocortex. This precocious neonatal serotonergic innervation may play a transient physiologic role in sensory areas of cortex or may exert a trophic influence on the development of cortical circuitry and thalamocortical connections.\r"

In dorsal root ganglion neurons, the toxin produces persistent block of L- and N-type Ca2+ channels but only transiently inhibits T-type channels. Its actions appear to be neuron-specific, since it blocks high-threshold Ca2+ channels in sensory, sympathetic, and hippocampal neurons of vertebrates but not in cardiac, skeletal, or smooth muscle cells. Block occurs through direct interaction of the toxin with an external site closely associated with the Ca2+ channel, without apparent involvement of a second messenger or dependence on channel gating. The tissue and channel-type specificity and the directness and slow reversibility of the block are features that favor use of omega-conotoxin as a tool for purifying particular neuronal Ca2+ channels and defining their physiological function.\r"

This procedure circumvents the purification of these membrane proteins, which is hindered by their low abundance and their hydrophobic nature. It involves methods for RNA fractionation by high-resolution gel electrophoresis, directional cDNA cloning in a single-stranded vector, and screening of the cDNA library by voltage-clamp measurements of currents induced by serotonin in mRNA-injected oocytes. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated by the isolation of a serotonin receptor cDNA clone from a mouse choroid plexus papilloma. The clone was identified by hybrid-depletion and hybrid-selection procedures. The receptor expressed in oocytes injected with hybrid-selected RNA is fully functional, indicating that it is composed of a single subunit encoded by a 5-kilobase RNA. The pharmacology of the hybrid-selected receptor confirms that we have successfully cloned a serotonin 5-HT1C receptor cDNA.\r"

Operation involved excision of the iliac artery in one instance, femoral artery in three, popliteal artery in two instances and radial artery in one. Wide local resection including revascularization was undertaken when the tumor could be resected with the artery but separated from the nerve and it was a low grade malignant disease or the patient refused amputation for a high grade malignant disease. In five patients, the tumor margins were adequate. One patient with an osteosarcoma of the pubis with distant disease had a palliative resection and one patient had positive margins but refused amputation. Coverage of the soft tissue and vascular grafts was achieved using a distant pedicle flap in two patients. Amputation was avoided and each patient remained ambulatory. Five patients remained free of disease with patent grafts at six months to six years of follow-up study. One patient died of late myocardial infarction and one who underwent palliative resection died eight months later of metastatic disease. Involvement of the major arterial circulation does not preclude adequate resection of sarcomas of the extremity with limb salvage.\r"

High-resolution analysis of prometaphase chromosomes revealed additional euchromatic material on the short arm of one of the patient's chromosomes 15.

Fibroblasts from the infant's parents, who were consanguinous, produced both normal and mutant alpha-chains. The size difference, estimated to be 2-3 kilodaltons on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, persisted after removal of oligosaccharides with endo-H and is therefore attributable to a shortened polypeptide. The mutant alpha-chain did not undergo the further posttranslational modifications characteristic of its normal counterpart--i.e., synthesis of the mannose phosphate recognition marker, association with the beta-chain to give HexA, and proteolytic conversion to the mature form. Nor was it secreted, even in the presence of NH4Cl. Instead, it disappeared in the course of a 20-h chase. These results suggest that the mutant alpha-chain was trapped in an early biosynthetic compartment, either the endoplasmic reticulum or the cis-Golgi. The mutation appears to be different from all those previously described in patients with clinically classic Tay-Sachs disease.\r"

A gut peptide radioimmunoassay laboratory has been established for the diagnosis and clinical monitoring of endocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system. Radioimmunoassay has enhanced our awareness that co-occurring peptide interactions may modify and ultimately influence the clinical expression of these tumors. Furthermore, it has helped develop a rationale for the use of prototype peptides such as somatostatin and its long-acting analogue Sandostatin (SMS 201-995) in the management of GEP tumors. This group's experience, as well as the experience of other investigators, is presented, and the clinical utility of peptide radioimmunoassay in the field of gut endocrinology is demonstrated.\r"

Statistically significant elevations in prostaglandin E2 metabolite or 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha occurred after transabdominal cervicoisthmic and transvaginal cerclage; they returned to control levels within 6 to 24 hours after surgery and were associated with good fetal outcome. Increases in 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha were proportionately greater than in prostaglandin E2 metabolite. Mean basal levels and the rise in prostaglandin metabolites were not related to cerclage type, trimester of pregnancy, or cervical status (dilatation less than or equal to 3 cm; effacement less than or equal to 60%). Highest basal and postcerclage 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha and prostaglandin E2 metabolite levels were associated with advanced cervical changes, uterine irritability, membrane prolapse or rupture, and premature delivery. Routine administration of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors is not indicated for transvaginal cerclage or transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage; plasma prostaglandin metabolite levels may identify patients not suitable for cerclage.\r"

It is easy to use and can be mounted on any conventional anaesthetic machine. It has several desirable features, such as a simple control and display panel, appropriate alarms and a patient breathing system that can be autoclaved. Observations were made on seven patients undergoing major surgery. Anaesthetic gases were introduced at 1, 2 and 4 litres/minute at three points in the breathing system, one conventionally in the closed system, one at the ventilator and one in the tracheal tube. Carbon dioxide homeostasis was maintained during this procedure. The application of fresh gas flows of 2 and 4 litres/minute in the tracheal tube allowed a small but significant reduction in the mean tidal volume. However, it was concluded that a fresh gas flow of 1 litre/minute applied conventionally either into the closed system or at the ventilator, provided optimal conditions.\r"

Decreased expression of the c-myc oncogene is linked to growth arrest and terminal cellular differentiation. The present study characterizes the effect of TNF alpha on the regulation of the c-myc gene in HL-60 cells. TNF alpha (100 U/mL) rapidly inhibited messenger RNA (mRNA) accumulation of c-myc with a 50% reduction in less than one hour. Dose-response studies showed that a 50% reduction of c-myc mRNA occurred in the range of 15 U/mL. In vitro nuclear run-on experiments showed that this decrease of c-myc-mRNA accumulation was the result of a reduced rate of transcription of c-myc by TNF alpha. Further studies demonstrated that TNF alpha did not post-transcriptionally alter levels of c-myc mRNA, and the inhibitory action of TNF alpha on c-myc expression in HL-60 cells did not depend on new protein synthesis. In the conditions of all the experiments, TNF alpha did not affect cell viability. By contrast, TNF alpha (500 U/mL) did not decrease mRNA levels of c-myc in an HL-60 variant cell line whose growth was not inhibited by TNF alpha; also TNF alpha (500 U/mL) increased c-myc-mRNA levels in normal fibroblasts whose growth is known to be stimulated by TNF alpha. These findings, in concert with prior studies, show a close association between growth inhibition of HL-60 cells and decreased levels of mRNA coding for c-myc.\r"

  ".W": "Refractoriness occurs in many patients receiving multiple platelet transfusions. We used a sensitive ELISA assay to assess the utility of crossmatching HLA-A,B matched single donor platelets in 51 consecutive, typical refractory patients. Of the 222 transfusions evaluated at 1 to 4 hours posttransfusion, only 17 of 54 (31%) with positive crossmatches had corrected platelet count increments of greater than or equal to 7,500/microL. In contrast, 95 of 168 (57%) of those with negative crossmatches had such increments (P less than .001). Regardless of the results of the crossmatch, HLA-A,B, and ABO matching had independent influences on transfusion outcome. The median corrected 1- to 4-hour increment for crossmatch negative transfusions was 13,300/microL for A/BU grade matches, 9,700 for BX, and 7,800 for C. Increments were 10,000/microL for ABO-identical transfusions and 5,900 for transfusions of platelets ABO incompatible with the recipient's plasma antibodies. When the donor platelets were ABO compatible, but the donor plasma contained ABO antibodies to the recipient's platelets, the increment was intermediate (8,200/microL). The most important factor in predicting platelet survival was the crossmatch, followed by HLA-A,B and ABO, each having independent predictive value. These data demonstrate that the predictive value of a negative crossmatch may be considerably less than that reported in previous studies with stable, less ill patients. In typical refractory patients, there appear to be mechanisms of platelet destruction that are related to HLA-A,B and ABO but are not detected with current crossmatch methods. We hypothesize that soluble plasma HLA-A,B and ABO antigens contribute to the destruction of donor and sometimes recipient platelets by an immune complex or other \"innocent bystander\" mechanism. With our crossmatching technique, HLA-A,B and ABO match grades remain relevant to platelet transfusion therapy in some refractory patients.\r"

Both the anti-abl and anti-bcr sera detected a 210 kd band in extracts derived from K562 cells and from two CML patients with myeloid blast crisis. p210 was detected by the anti-abl but not the anti-bcr sera in three CML patients with myeloid (one patient) and lymphoid (two patients) blast crisis, indicating the absence of bcr exon 3 in this protein. Southern blot analysis on DNA derived from one of the patients in the latter group was consistent with the break on chromosome 22 occurring 5' to bcr exon 3.

The patients' ages ranged from 0.8 to 17 years (median, 5 years) and their initial leukocyte counts from 1.0 to 132 X 10(9)/L (median, 12.7 X 10(9)/L). Modal chromosome numbers for the leukemic stem lines were 45 in 26 cases, 28 in two cases, and 26, 36 and 43 in one case each. Seven cases had one to three additional abnormal lines due to clonal evolution. Chromosome 20 was lost most frequently (nine cases). Structural abnormalities--including chromosomal translocations (21 cases), deletions (ten cases), duplications (two cases), or inversions (one case)--were common findings; the nonrandom translocations consisted of the t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) in two pre-B cases and tdic(9;12)(p1?1;p1?2) in three cases of common ALL. When compared with hyperdiploid cases (greater than 50 chromosomes), ALL with hypodiploidy was found to have a poorer outcome and was more likely to be associated with chromosomal translocations, higher serum lactic dehydrogenase levels, and age less than 2 or greater than or equal to 10 years. Moreover, patients with hypodiploid ALL fared as poorly as those with pseudodiploid karyotypes, even though their leukocyte counts and serum lactic dehydrogenase levels were lower and they had a comparable frequency of leukemic cell translocations. Hypodiploidy is therefore an unfavorable karyotypic feature in childhood ALL.\r"

However, many of the earlier epidemiologic studies of leukemia have not considered specific histologic subtypes separately. The association between cigarette smoking and adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was examined in a case-control study of 114 patients and 133 controls. Cigarette smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of acute myelocytic leukemia (relative risk estimate = 1.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.01 to 3.15) along with a significant (P less than 0.001) dose-response based on the total number of years of cigarette smoking. Since this is a preliminary study, more analyses of other epidemiologic studies are needed before it can be concluded that there is a causal association.\r"

The remission duration was short with a median of 33 weeks, and the median overall survival was only 6 weeks. Those patients without identifiable infection, liver enlargement, and a serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase less than or equal to 40 U/ml constituted a more favorable subgroup.

  ".W": "Three cases of megakaryoblastic transformation of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) are reported. In each case, the leukemic transformation had morphologic features suggesting megakaryocytic differentiation. This was confirmed by positive immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody (HP1-1D) specific for platelet and megakaryocyte glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen, which was expressed by the majority of the leukemic blasts in all three cases. Cases with evidence of multilineage differentiation of the leukemic transformation were excluded. A striking feature in two patients was the manifestation of lytic bone lesions and soft tissue masses at presentation. A biopsy of a lytic bone lesion and soft tissue mass in one patient revealed a megakaryoblastic leukemic infiltrate, which by immunocytochemical staining was positive for the megakaryocytic markers, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen, and Factor VIII (von Willebrand factor) antigen. In contrast to granulocytic sarcomas, the megakaryoblastic sarcoma did not stain cytochemically for chloroacetate esterase. The mean survival after acute transformation was 5.3 months. The three cases of megakaryoblastic transformation represented a significant proportion of all CGL blastic transformation cases (ten cases) evaluated by bone marrow examination in our institution during a 13-month period. Megakaryoblastic transformation of CGL may occur more frequently than has been appreciated, and can present as lytic bone lesions or as soft tissue megakaryoblastic sarcomas.\r"

Three had osteogenic sarcomas, and one each had Ewing's sarcoma, biphasic synovial sarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, undifferentiated spindling sarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. All eight tumors showed evidence of regression after intraarterial infusion of cisplatin and Adriamycin (doxorubicin) given over 48 hours at 3-week intervals, for a total of between three and seven courses. Tru-cut needle biopsy specimens of five of the lesions were normal after chemotherapy. However, after resection of the regressed fibrotic tumor in seven of the patients, four contained foci of probably viable malignant cells. These cell foci were intraosseous in three cases and in the wall of a cyst in one case. In the remaining case, tumor in the distribution of the infused artery regressed, but tumor in a region supplied by an artery that was not infused continued to enlarge. In one patient with osteogenic sarcoma in the pelvis, despite a good response to intraarterial chemotherapy that was followed by surgical resection and radiotherapy, tumor recurred in an adjacent area in tissues supplied by an artery not infused. A hindquarter amputation subsequently was required. With the exception of the two cases in which adequate tumor arterial infusion was not achieved, local primary tumor control was accomplished by intraarterial infusion chemotherapy followed by local resection or radiotherapy and local resection in all patients. Four patients are well without evidence of residual or metastatic sarcoma 3.5 years after presentation in the case of an osteogenic sarcoma of shoulder, 2.5 years after presentation in the case of a large pleomorphic liposarcoma of thigh and groin, 20 months after presentation in the case of lower-thigh malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 1 year after presentation in a child with an osteogenic sarcoma of lower femur.\r"

This analysis has shown that, whereas the proportion of patients with residual AML at any anatomic site decreased significantly and uniformly over the entire study period, significant corresponding decreases in patients with CGL and ALL occurred only since 1976 and 1978, respectively. No significant corresponding decreases were noted in patients with CLL at any time. Significant decreases were also noted over time in the rates of extramedullary site involvement by AML, CGL, and ALL. Whereas the lymphoreticular organs, kidneys, adrenals, and pituitary were most often involved at autopsy by CLL, the testes, leptomeninges, dura mater, uterus, large bowel, and pancreas were most often involved by ALL. In general, patients with AML and CGL showed the lowest relative rates of involvement of the various organs by leukemia during the 24-year period. Whereas patients with AML and ALL showed significant decreases in the rates of involvement of nearly all anatomic sites during the most recent study periods, those with CGL and CLL showed corresponding decreases in only a few organ sites. The lower rates of organ involvement in patients with AML and ALL attest to the more aggressive eradication of leukemic cells by therapeutic regimens in these diseases over time. In particular, the significant decrease in the rate of meningeal involvement by ALL during the most recent period is probably attributable to central nervous system prophylaxis.\r"

None of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease showed strong dysplasia or had manifest carcinoma. Both antigens were expressed frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 18 patients with ulcerative colitis, 17 were positive for both CA 19-9 and CA-50, and of the 29 with Crohn's colitis, 21 were positive for CA 19-9 and 22 for CA-50. No distinct differences in antigenic expression were found between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CA-50 was expressed in normal colonic mucosa from 10 of 12 patients with sigmoid volvulus or diverticular disease, and such mucosa was positive for CA 19-9 in three of the four patients with diverticular disease and in two of the eight patients with sigmoid volvulus. It is concluded that immunodetection of CA-50 or CA 19-9 is of limited value in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. The usefulness of these antigens as markers for precancerous changes in inflammatory bowel disease is also doubtful, since the expression is also frequent in cases of inflammatory lesions, with no obviously increased risk of malignancy.\r"

  ".U": "87246352\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) has a differential effect on the growth and function of bovine adrenocortical cells in vitro. TGF beta inhibits basal as well as ACTH- or angiotensin II-stimulated steroid formation, with no evidence of change in cell growth. The major inhibitory effect of TGF beta occurs at a step before cholesterol formation, since treatment of adrenocortical cells with TGF beta decreased not only delta 4-steroid levels but also delta 5-steroid levels. The addition of cholesterol reverses the suppression of steroidogenesis induced by TGF beta. To determine the mechanism of this inhibition, the effect of TGF beta on low density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism was investigated. Cells treated with TGF beta showed a significant suppression of [125I]iodohuman LDL ([125I]LDL) binding to the cell surface, followed by decreases in internalization and proteolytic degradation of [125I]LDL. Maximal inhibition of LDL metabolism was observed at a concentration of 1 ng/ml (4 X 10(-11) M) TGF beta. The stimulation of LDL metabolism by ACTH was also inhibited by TGF beta, and the inhibition observed correlated well with the inhibition of steroidogenesis. The inhibitory effect of TGF beta on [125I]LDL binding results from the decrease in the maximal LDL-binding capacity. The stimulation of LDL uptake induced by Bu2cAMP, cholera toxin, forskolin, and Ang II was also decreased by treatment with 1 ng/ml TGF beta. The specificity of this effect is quite high, since the inhibitory effects of TGF beta on LDL metabolism were not observed with either inhibin A or activin, two molecules that have considerable structural homology to TGF beta. We conclude that TGF beta specifically suppresses LDL metabolism in bovine adrenocortical cell cultures and that this step may mediate, at least in part, its role as a potent inhibitor of steroidogenesis.\r"

TGF beta increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and the rate of collagen synthesis per cell. Cell proliferation was inhibited, and the morphological appearance of the cells was markedly changed. All effects were observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml TGF beta. Increases in AP activity were detectable after 24 h and increased progressively with time. TGF beta increased AP activity under serum-free conditions and during thymidine-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis. The increase in AP activity mediated by TGF beta could be completely inhibited with actinomycin D and cycloheximide. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 at 10(-7) M slightly increased AP activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, but strongly inhibited AP activity when the cells were pretreated with TGF beta. The data suggest that TGF beta stimulates expression of the osteoblastic phenotype in ROS 17/2.8 cells and that TGF beta may be an important regulator of local bone remodeling.\r"

Substances were injected into the third cerebral ventricle of anesthetized rats while rectal temperature and hepatic venous plasma glucose concentration were recorded. Stereotaxic microinjection of PGD2, E1, E2, and F2 alpha produced hyperglycemia and hyperthermia. The relative order of potency in hyperglycemia, PGF2 alpha greater than D2 greater than E1 greater than E2, was not consistent with that of hyperthermia, PGE2 greater than F2 alpha greater than E1 greater than D2, which suggests that hyperglycemia was a primary, not secondary, response to hyperthermia. Injection of PGF2 alpha caused a dose dependent (5-200 micrograms) increase in the hepatic venous plasma glucose level. Neither the injection of PGF2 alpha (50 micrograms) into the cortex nor into the systemic vein caused hyperglycemia. The injection of PGF2 alpha into the ventricle resulted in the increase of not only glucose, but also glucagon, epinephrine, and norephinephrine in the hepatic venous plasma. However, constant infusion of somatostatin through the femoral vein completely prevented the increase of glucagon after administration of PGF2 alpha, although the increase of plasma glucose level was still observed. PGF2 alpha-induced hyperglycemia did not occur in adrenodemedullated rats. Intravenous injection of naloxone or propranolol did not affect the hyperglycemia, but phentolamine significantly prevented the hyperglycemic effect of PGF2 alpha. These results suggest that intraventricular PGF2 alpha affects the central nervous system to produce hyperglycemia by increasing epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla.\r"

Radioreceptor assay demonstrated the presence of specific cellular retinol-binding protein and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein in the ovaries of rats injected with PMSG alone or PMSG and hCG. In addition, when luteinizing granulosa cell from PMSG/hCG-injected immature rats were cultured with or without retinoic acid, the morphology, viability, number of cells in culture, and progesterone (P) accumulation were not affected by up to 10 microM retinoic acid. Beyond 10 microM, the cells began to round up, which was associated with a decrease in cell viability. Surprisingly, the deleterious concentrations of retinoic acid increased progesterone accumulation significantly higher than the medium control value. This increase in progesterone, however, was not accompanied by an increase in cAMP. When cells preincubated for 2 days with 1 microM of either retinoic acid or retinol were subsequently incubated in retinoid-free medium containing various substrates for steroidogenesis, the following results were obtained. Basal progesterone and its accumulation in response to human low density lipoprotein were significantly higher in cells preincubated with retinoids than in the control cells. However, no difference was seen in the degree of stimulation between retinol and retinoic acid pretreatments. Both 25-hydroxycholesterol, a substrate for side-chain cleavage enzyme, and pregnenolone, a substrate for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, significantly stimulated the accumulation of progesterone in cells preincubated with retinoids over the control value. Again, no appreciable difference was observed between retinol and retinoic acid pretreatments. Our results suggest that receptors for retinoids are present in gonadotropin-primed immature rat ovaries, retinoids increase luteal cell progesterone accumulation, and no difference exists between retinol and retinoic acid in their ability to increase the accumulation of progesterone by these cells.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between thyroid hormone and TSH subunit mRNA levels and gene transcription in rat pituitaries was investigated. Synthesis of alpha-subunit and TSH-beta mRNAs were measured by incorporation of [32P]UTP into isolated nuclei, followed by hybridization of labeled transcripts to specific cDNAs. Steady state levels of mRNA were measured by Northern blot analysis of mRNA followed by hybridization with labeled TSH beta and alpha-subunit cDNAs. Hybridizing bands were quantitated by densitometry. TSH subunit mRNA synthesis was suppressed by T3 treatment in a manner directly related to T3 receptor occupancy; this effect occurred both in vivo and in cell culture. In the euthyroid rat, alpha-subunit mRNA had a higher level of synthesis [126 parts/million (ppm)] than did TSH beta mRNA (24 ppm). In the hypothyroid animal this situation was reversed, and the synthesis of both alpha-subunit and TSH beta mRNAs was increased to 230 and 331 ppm, respectively. T3 administration to hypothyroid animals suppressed mRNA synthesis maximally to 69 ppm for alpha-subunit and 10 ppm for TSH beta. The alpha-subunit to TSH beta mRNA synthesis ratio can thus vary from 0.7 in the hypothyroid animal to 6.9 in the hyperthyroid animal. The transcription rate for both genes decreased in linear fashion with increased T3 nuclear receptor occupancy. A 50% decrease in transcription occurred at a T3 dose (10(-9) M) similar to the Kd of the thyroid receptor. This agrees with our previous findings in thyrotropic tumors indicating a time- and dose-dependent suppression of the TSH subunit genes with increasing levels of nuclear receptor-bound T3. In primary rat pituitary cultures, T3 directly regulated steady state levels and synthesis of TSH subunit mRNA. With euthyroid pituitary cultures, alpha-subunit mRNA synthesis (50 ppm) was greater than that of TSH beta (12 ppm), but with hypothyroid pituitary cultures both mRNAs were synthesized at nearly equal rates (alpha-subunit, 120 ppm; TSH beta, 105 ppm). T3 (10(-8) M) treatment of hypothyroid cultures for 3 days decreased alpha-subunit (60% of control) and TSH beta (35% of control) mRNAs. Thus, mRNA synthesis is changed coordinately for both TSH subunits, but TSH beta is altered to a greater extent by thyroid status.\r"

After digestion of hCG beta with trypsin, the residual disulfide-linked core was isolated and found to be lacking the carboxy-terminal peptide (residues 115-145) and to contain bond cleavages between residues 2-3, 43-44, 74-75, and 95-96. The locations of these bond cleavages within the disulfide-bridged core were identified by isolation of the following peptides after reduction and S-carboxymethylation of the trypsin beta-core: beta 1-43, beta 3-43, beta 44-74, beta 44-95, beta 75-95, and beta 96-114. The circular dichroic spectrum of the tryptic beta-core over the wavelength region of about 200-320 nm was similar to that of the native subunit. In addition, the tryptic beta-core retained nearly full immunopotency in both polyclonal and monoclonal competitive RIAs and could combine with complementary native alpha-subunit. The hybrid, composed of the tryptic beta-core and native alpha, was purified and displayed a molar potency of about 0.1% relative to intact hCG in both a radioreceptor assay and an adenylate cyclase assay. Thus, the hybrid retained little biological activity. Although the extensive bond cleavages in the tryptic beta-core did not appear to change its secondary and tertiary structure sufficiently to significantly alter the circular dichroic spectrum, the immunoreactivity, or the capability to combine with its alpha-subunit complement, the biological functional integrity of the tryptic beta-core-containing hybrid was essentially abolished. Hence, the tryptic beta-core provides a useful derivative for detailed structure-function studies aimed at defining the necessary determinants for subunit association, receptor binding, and subsequent biological actions.\r"

Treatment in vivo with low doses of 17 beta-estradiol or high doses of 17 alpha-estradiol 26 h and 2 h prior to sacrifice inhibited bone PGE2 release in vitro. Addition of 17 beta-estradiol to calvariae in vitro did not affect PGE2 release, whereas cortisol inhibited PGE2 release.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro model for evaluation of pharmacologic treatment of ectopic pregnancy (EP) was designed. In cases of EP, specimens from the tubal wall, the tubal artery, and the corpus luteum capsule were used for contractility studies. In addition, tissue slices from the corpus luteum of EP were incubated for determination of progesterone production. In vitro administration of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) induced a marked increase in activity of the tubal muscle and pronounced constriction of the tubal artery. PGF2 alpha also reduced the human chorionic gonadotropin-induced increase in progesterone production from the corpus luteum. PGE2 conversely, inhibited the tubal muscle activity and had a moderate constrictive effect on the tubal artery. Furthermore PGE2 increased the progesterone formation from the corpus luteum. In theory, the demonstrated in vitro effects indicate that as opposed to PGE2 compounds, PGF2 alpha compounds may be useful for pharmacologic treatment of EP.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of prolactin (PRL) on progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) synthesis by cells obtained from human corpora lutea of early and midluteal phases. The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of low (200 mIU/l) or high levels (1000 mIU/l) of PRL. Basal P, but not E2 was significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced by the low level of PRL, whereas the high level of PRL increased P only in midcycle cells during the initial 48 hours of culture. The high PRL dose significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced E2 production in both early and midcycle cells during the initial 48 hours of culture. Both levels of PRL significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated P and E2 production in early luteal cells. In the midcycle corpora lutea cells, the low dose of PRL enhanced hCG-stimulated P but not E2, whereas the high dose of PRL was inhibitory to both P and E2. The high dose of PRL also inhibited prostaglandin E2 but not 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate-stimulated P and E2 synthesis. These results demonstrate that PRL has a direct effect on luteal cell steroidogenesis.\r"

Dazmegrel at a dose of 1 and 5 mg per rat (4.8 and 23.8 mg/kg) significantly reduced the damage caused by acidified taurocholate. In parallel experiments dazmegrel exerted a selective and dose dependent inhibition of ex vivo thromboxane synthesis by gastric fragments over the dose range in which protection was observed. As dazmegrel can be given to man, these experiments suggest that investigation of mucosal protection would be justified.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipase C activity and diglyceride lipase activity were studied in the renal cortex and medulla of 10- and 40-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Enhanced phospholipase C activity was found in the cortical and medullary cytosol of kidney from SHRSP, and microsomal diglyceride lipase in SHRSP also increased. In SHRSP, phospholipase C and diglyceride lipase activities increased with age, but this increase was not evident in WKY. Phospholipase C had high substrate specificity for phosphatidylinositol in renal cytosol of both WKY and SHRSP. The increased activities were accompanied by prostaglandin E2 synthesis in renal medullary microsomes of 10-week-old SHRSP and were also present in the kidney of 40-week-old SHRSP. Total phospholipid and arachidonic acid contents in kidney were markedly high in the medulla of 10-week-old SHRSP, but these lipids were decreased in 40-week-old SHRSP. These results suggest that phospholipids and arachidonic acid in SHRSP may be genetically high and that the activated phospholipase C and diglyceride lipase hydrolyze phospholipids, providing arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis, which results in a decrease of phospholipids and arachidonic acid in the kidney of 40-week-old SHRSP. These studies demonstrate that a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-prostaglandin synthetic system may play an important role in the course of hypertension in SHRSP.\r"

  ".U": "87249115\r", 
  ".W": "This study examined the relationship between a plasma factor (or factors) that inhibits the release of thromboxane A2 from platelets and excessive salt intake in rats. The plasma factor, termed platelet inhibitory factor, was also characterized. The release of thromboxane A2 from thrombin-activated platelets was reduced in Wistar rats that were uninephrectomized and given 2% saline for a week, but not in rats with acute volume expansion. Platelet inhibitory factor was extracted from the plasma of these uninephrectomized and saline-loaded rats and partially purified using membrane sieves, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), modified straight-phase HPLC, and gel-permeation column chromatography. The molecular weight of the factor was about 4300 daltons by gel filtration method. The partially purified platelet inhibitory factor decreased the release not only of thromboxane A2, but also of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2 from thrombin-activated platelets. The factor inhibited the aggregation of human platelets induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and thrombin, but not that by arachidonate. The platelet inhibitory factor reduced the activities of phospholipases A2 and C but did not affect the conversion of arachidonate to thromboxane A2. Furthermore, platelet inhibitory factor decreased prostaglandin E2 production in cultured renal cells, and platelet inhibitory factor-like activity was detected in kidney extract from the salt-loaded rats. These results suggest that platelet inhibitory factor is produced by chronic salt intake and involved in the functional alterations of the platelets and probably the kidneys, mainly through its inhibitory action on the liberation of arachidonate.\r"

In six of the forty-eight patients, the imaging demonstrated non-pulmonary metastases that had not been detected by any other staging studies. Scintigraphy with gallium-67 citrate should be employed routinely for staging of soft-tissue sarcomas because of its utility in detecting non-pulmonary metastases that are not otherwise detected on routine staging studies.\r"
