  ".W": "Most studies of the activation requirements for T cells have used either T cell lines or populations of normal T cells that consist of a mixture of virgin and Ag-primed T cells. These two subpopulations of T cells can now be distinguished in humans by their reactivity with mAb. The anti-CD45R antibody HB10 identifies virgin T cells (T degrees) that are non-reactive to recall Ag and relatively poor at providing help for B cell differentiation. Conversely, memory T cells (T') that can react to recall Ag and enhance Ig production are non-reactive with anti-CD45R, but can be identified with the UCHL1 antibody. We have used these antibodies to separate the T degrees and T' populations and examine their activation requirements. On activation CD45R+ cells rapidly began to lose the CD45R Ag and express the UCHL1 Ag in increased amounts, whereas the UCHL1+ cells retained this phenotype. Both populations responded to PHA in the presence of monocytes, but when triggered by an antibody to CD3 only the T' cells were induced to express IL-2R, produce IL-2, and to proliferate. The T degrees population of cells remained relatively quiescent by all of these parameters. However, anti-CD3 stimulation conditioned the T degrees cells for IL-2 responsiveness, inasmuch as the addition of rIL-2 resulted in significant IL-2R expression and proliferation. When the CD4+ T degrees and CD4+ T' subpopulations were isolated and examined in the same assays similar results were obtained. The data indicate that fundamental differences exist in the triggering requirements for T degrees and T' cells.\r"

Bryo induced IL-2R expression on CD4+ and CD8+ human T lymphocytes with a dose response comparable to PMA. However, Bryo induced only a marginal proliferative response as compared with the vigorous response induced by PMA. Bryo mediated functional receptor expression because the proliferative response was enhanced by addition of rIL-2. Furthermore, the proliferative response was inhibited by the relatively specific Ca+, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) inhibitor, H-7, indicating a role of PKC in Bryo-induced activation. Addition of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, to Bryo-stimulated lymphocytes resulted in the production and secretion of IL-2 with a concomitant proliferative response. This effect of the calcium ionophore could be inhibited by cyclosporine with identical results obtained in PMA-stimulated cultures. A most intriguing finding was that Bryo could effectively antagonize PMA-induced T cell proliferation. Although this mechanism of inhibition is unclear, a discussion with respect to differential effects on potential intracellular PKC isoforms is provided. These studies indicated that Bryo has potent immunopotentiating properties that share some similar effects of the phorbol ester, PMA, but offers the additional property of modulating other phorbol ester effects on proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Attempts were made to generate Ag-specific suppressor T cells from Ag-primed spleen cells by using glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). BDF1 mice were primed with alum-absorbed OVA and their spleen cells were stimulated with OVA. Ag-activated T cells were then propagated in IL-2-containing conditioned medium. Incubation of the T cells with OVA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages resulted in the formation of IgE-potentiating factor and glycosylation-enhancing factor that has affinity for OVA, i.e., OVA-specific glycosylation-enhancing factor. However, if the same Ag-activated splenic T cells were propagated in the IL-2-containing medium in the presence of GIF T cells obtained in the cultures formed IgE-suppressive factors and OVA-specific GIF on antigenic stimulation. Thus we constructed T cell hybridomas from the Ag-activated T cells propagated by IL-2 in the presence of GIF. A representative hybridoma, 71B4, formed OVA-specific GIF on incubation with OVA-pulsed macrophages of BDF1 mice or C57B1/6 mice. However, if the same hybridoma cells were incubated with OVA alone or with OVA-pulsed macrophages of H-2k or H-2d strains, they produced GIF that had no affinity for OVA. The OVA-specific GIF bound to OVA-Sepharose but did not bind to BSA-Sepharose or KLH Sepharose. Intravenous injections of the OVA-specific GIF from the hybridoma suppressed the IgE and IgG1 anti-DNP antibody response of BDF1 mice to DNP-OVA, but failed to suppress the anti-hapten antibody responses of the strain to DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, indicating that the factors suppressed the antibody response in a carrier-specific manner. However, the same OVA-specific GIF failed to suppress the anti-hapten antibody response of DBA/1 mice to DNP-OVA, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effects of the factors is MHC restricted.\r"

The antigenic stimulation increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in both clones, but enhanced inositol phospholipid metabolism only in 35-8H cells. The treatment of 34-7F cells with PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, synergized with the antigenic stimulation to induce the proliferation of the T cells. Thus, the failure of 34-7F cells to proliferate in the Ag response appears to result from the absence of an increase in inositol phospholipid metabolism. The absence is likely due to the defect in B cells as APC, inasmuch as the antigenic stimulation of 34-7F cells with whole spleen cells induced increases in inositol phospholipid metabolism and proliferation. The PMA treatment synergized with the Ag on B cells to enhance IL-2R expression, which was not inhibited by the addition of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker. The agent inhibited the IL-2 production. Taken together, the results in the present experiments suggest the association of IL-2 production with increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration but not in inositol phospholipid metabolism, and that of IL-2R expression with increases in the metabolism but not in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence has shown that cloned, murine CTL cell lines are resistant to the cytotoxic components of the toxic granules they release upon specific interaction with their target cells. Inasmuch as the resistance might be due to selection in culture over many months by repeated exposure to these cytolytic components (which are released repeatedly as a result of the cultured CTL being periodically stimulated by target cells), we asked whether primary CTL are also resistant. The primary CTL were elicited in vivo by i.p. injection of allogeneic tumor cells or in vitro by 5- to 6-day MLC or by 48-h exposure to the lectin Con A. The responding cells were separated into purified CD8+ (i.e., CD4-, CD8+) and purified CD4+ (i.e., CD4+, CD8-) T cell populations that were analyzed for cytolytic activity and for resistance to lysis by toxic secretory granules derived from cloned CTL cell lines. The CD8+ T cells were highly cytolytic and relatively resistant; they retained their cytolytic activity and were lysed to a minimal extent (0 to 10%) by quantities of isolated granules that lysed 80 to 90% of the P815 tumor cell line (tested as a representative standard cell line). The CD4+ T cells, in contrast, had only minimal cytolytic activity and were far more susceptible to granule-mediated lysis. Although the resistance of primary CD8+ T cells is impressive, it is not as pronounced as the resistance of the cloned CTL cell lines, indicating that during long-term culture there is some selection for increased resistance to granule-mediated lysis. In contrast to T cells (especially CD8+ T cells), Ia+ macrophages, isolated from primary immune peritoneal exudates, were highly susceptible to granule-mediated lysis.\r"

The inhibition was to due to cytotoxicity or effects through the TCR because none of the eight inhibitors inhibited IL-2-induced T cell proliferation, and because they did not inhibit Ag presentation by fixed APC or synthetic polypeptide. The conclusion after these data suggests that each specific antigenic fragment is produced by a unique set of proteases.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently reported a simple technique for the purification of large granular lymphocyte/NK cells with broad anti-tumor cytotoxicity (lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity) by the induction of their adherence to plastic surfaces by recombinant IL-2. Using this technique with nylon wool passed human peripheral blood or splenic lymphocytes we generated populations of adherent LAK (A-LAK) cells which were 80 to 95% large granular lymphocyte and up to 97% Leu-19+ cells. Using two-color fluorescence and cell sorting we now demonstrate that these same cells express a high density of surface structures which are immunochemically cross-reactive with affinity purified anti-laminin antibody. Laminin-like structures were expressed on 80 to 90% of Leu-19+/CD3- LAK cells but were not expressed on resting CD3+/CD4+/Leu19- T cells or CD3+/CD8+/Leu19- T cells. Laminin-like molecules were also expressed on resting Leu19+/CD3- large granular lymphocyte/NK cells (purified to more than 98% by cell sorting) and increased in intensity as these cells developed LAK activity in response to rIL-2. The functional involvement of laminin-like molecules in NK and LAK cytotoxicity was demonstrated by the ability of affinity purified anti-laminin F(ab')2 antibody to inhibit cytolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner (50% inhibition with 10 to 20 micrograms F(ab')2). Analysis of the mechanism of inhibition using single cell cytotoxicity assays indicated that the laminin-like structure was involved in activation of cytotoxicity and not in primary target cell adhesion. We believe that this structure may function as a novel recognition/activation structure used by cells mediating non-MHC restricted cytotoxicity.\r"

Characterization of these subtypes to date have indicated that Th1 cells secrete IL-2, IFN-gamma, lymphotoxin, and IL-3, whereas Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-3. Functionally, Th1 cells mediated cytotoxicity and delayed-type hypersensitivity, and have been termed \"inflammatory cells,\" whereas Th2 cells mediate helper function for Ig secretion and have been termed, \"regulatory cells.\" We now present evidence that not all Th1 clones are inflammatory and capable of mediating cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity. We have generated a number of myelin basic protein-specific Th1 clones that do not mediate swelling when injected together with myelin basic protein directly into the footpads of syngeneic mice. These results suggest that Th1 cells can be further subdivided based on their ability to mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity, and that the Th1/Th2 characterization of Th cells may be insufficient to adequately characterize all functional subtypes of class II MHC-restricted T cells.\r"

One of this antibody anti-Ti gamma A is specific for an epitope encoded by the V9 gamma-gene. The two others react with the delta-chain but their fine epitopic specificity has not been characterized previously. In the present study, we have compared the surface expression of these three antigenic determinants on 27 cloned and 5 polyclonal CD3+ TCR gamma/delta + cell lines derived from human peripheral blood of 13 distinct individuals. It was found that all CD3+ TCR alpha/beta- clones and polyclonal cell lines tested were recognized by anti-TCR delta 1. In contrast, only a fraction of both clones and cell lines reacted with either anti-Ti gamma A or anti-delta TCS1 mAb. In fact reactivity of the latter reagents was found to be mutually exclusive on the cell panel. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from a series representative clones showed a positive correlation between the surface expression of the delta TCS1 epitope and the transcription of the V-delta gene isolated from the IDP2 cell line. These data support the view that anti-TCR delta 1 can be used to positively define the entire TCR gamma/delta+ fraction. Moreover, the reciprocal reactivity of anti-delta TCS1 and anti-Ti gamma A on cultured cell lines suggests that these reagents should delineate in human peripheral blood distinct, essentially non-overlapping, subsets. Taken together, the present results indicate that the complementary use of these three antibodies will be helpful to further characterize the TCR gamma/delta + peripheral lymphocyte fraction.\r"

However, several lines of evidence suggested that IL-2 was not the lymphokine that mediated T cell help. B cells primed with native AChR and then exposed in culture to very low concentrations of native AChR effectively presented the Ag to the T cell lines, presumably due to uptake via Ag receptors, but primed B cells were no more effective than were non-specific APC at presenting a synthetic AChR peptide which is recognized by AChR-specific T cells but not by AChR-specific B cells. Increasing AChR doses produced an antibody production response that was bell shaped and low doses stimulated, whereas higher AChR concentrations suppressed the antibody production response. Evidence suggested that AChR exerted its inhibitory effect through the T cells, but not via IL-2.\r"

We analyzed the contribution of MHC genes to the development of IgG antinuclear antibody production and immune complex glomerulonephritis in MHC-congenic F1 recipients. DBA/2 T cells elicited IgG antibodies to histone, ssDNA, and dsDNA in all histoincompatible F1 recipients that were studied. The anti-DNA antibody responses were quantitatively similar among the F1 combinations and displayed comparable IgG2a subclass and cationic charge characteristics. In contrast, severe renal disease was manifested only in F1 mice that expressed H-2b encoded class II gene products. Disease susceptibility was associated with a decrease in circulating anti-DNA antibodies and a characteristic localization of immune complexes in the glomeruli. The data suggest that the production of potentially pathogenic IgG anti-nuclear antibodies is not sufficient for the development of renal disease in GVH-induced lupus. Thus, another event separate from autoantibody production is MHC dependent and appears to be critical for the formation and/or deposition of pathologic immune complexes.\r"

  ".W": "In early studies we found that IL-1 stimulated endothelial cells (EC) to produce platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Inasmuch as this phospholipid has a wide range of biologic activities, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) aggregation and chemotaxis, we investigated whether EC-associated PAF could contribute to IL-1-induced PMN adhesion to EC. When four selective PAF antagonists were added to IL-1-stimulated EC during the PMN adhesion assay, adhesion was reduced in a concentration-related way. Similarly, pre-treatment of PMN with PAF before the adhesion assay to induce desensitization to this phospholipid reduced PMN adhesion to IL-1-treated EC. However, comparing the time course and the concentration response curve of IL-1-induced EC adhesivity and PAF synthesis, we found that increased EC adhesivity to PMN required a shorter incubation time and lower concentration of IL-1 to become apparent than PAF production. When acetyl-coenzyme A was added to EC cultures at a concentration that raised PAF synthesis by 60%, no significant increase in PMN adhesion was observed. In addition, after 9 to 10 doublings, the EC ability to synthesize PAF decreased by 85 to 90%, whereas IL-1-induced EC adhesivity to PMN was only slightly diminished. When IL-1-alpha and -beta were tested on EC, we observed that both were equally active in promoting PMN adhesion to EC but only the alpha-form was able to stimulate PAF production. When PMN were seeded on IL-1-treated EC, increased amounts of PAF were detected even when EC were fixed; in addition, the inhibitory effect of a PAF antagonist was evident also in these conditions. Overall these results indicate that IL-1-induced PAF production by EC does not significantly contribute to PMN adhesion to them. We hypothesize that the observed inhibitory effect of PAF antagonists and PAF desensitization of PMN might be directed at PAF produced by PMN themselves during adhesion to IL-1-treated EC.\r"

This CD5- mutant subclone was infected with a defective retrovirus containing the CD5 cDNA and/or the neo gene encoding G418 resistance. The CD5+ wild type Jurkat produced IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 mAb, OKT3, cross-linked to a solid surface. IL-2 production was enhanced by co-culture with IL-1 or anti-CD5 Mab. Neither the CD5- mutant nor the CD5- G418-resistant infectant responded to anti-CD5 mAb or to IL-1. Responsiveness to IL-1 was restored by cell surface expression of CD5 in the CD5+ infectant. Both the CD5+ wild type Jurkat and the CD5+ infectant responded equivalently to purified IL-1, IL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta. Optimal concentrations of IL-1 and anti-CD5 mAb had an additive effect on the enhancement of IL-2 production stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3 mAb suggesting that IL-1 and CD5 act through distinct, complementary pathways to augment T cell activation. The correlation of CD5 expression and specific binding of rIL-1 beta was examined in these cell lines. Both the specific binding (at 4 degrees C) and subsequent internalization (at 37 degrees C) of 125I labeled rIL-1 beta was equivalent in the CD5+ infectant and the CD5+ wild type Jurkat cell, whereas specific binding of 125I-labeled rIL-1 beta was markedly decreased in the CD5-G418-resistant infectant. These observations strongly suggest that cell surface expression of CD5 regulates binding of and responsiveness to IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that the requirements for the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by normal L3T4+T cells from murine spleen are very different from those for the production of IL-2. Secretion of detectable quantities of IL-4 and IL-5 and induction of the mRNA for each lymphokine occurs in vitro only after cells are primed and re-stimulated. This priming can be achieved by mitogens (Con A), by antibodies to the TCR (anti-T3) or by stimulation with alloantigen. In contrast, requirements for induction of lymphokine production after priming resemble those for initial production of IL-2. Thus the majority of T cells of helper phenotype that have the potential to become IL-4- and IL-5-secreting T cells, exist in the form of precursors requiring stimulation and several days of culture as well as re-stimulation with mitogen or Ag before they become detectable as lymphokine-secreting cells. In contrast, among fresh CD4+T cells, secretion of IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage CSF, and IFN-gamma is easily detected within 24 h of stimulation with mitogen or Ag. These observations establish that distinct phenotypes of Th cells are found at different times after stimulation and support the concept that synthesis and secretion of different lymphokines or groups of lymphokines are regulated independently. Furthermore the patterns of lymphokines secreted by fresh vs primed Th cells, which largely correspond to the patterns that have been used to define the Th1 and Th2 subsets among Th cell lines, provides evidence that different subsets of normal T cells exist that may correspond to these designations. Secretion of different lymphokines by two subsets of Th cells at different times in an immune response, and perhaps in different places, suggests a model in which the ratio of the two T cell subsets (Th1 vs Th2) and state of differentiation of each (precursor vs effector), influence or determine the direction of the response, with variations in these parameters leading to differing responses.\r"

  ".W": "Here we report that autoreactive T cell clones and T cell hybridomas that recognize class I or class II MHC determinants can induce IL-1 expression on cultured macrophages in an MHC-restricted manner. This genetic restriction of membrane IL-1 (mIL-1) induction is not absolute, however; it is manifest only in macrophages that have been cultured for several days before stimulation. Macrophages that are evaluated within 24 h after adherence display a basal level of mIL-1, and the T cell-induced augmentation of basal mIL-1 expression is not MHC-restricted. It appears that T cells of both Th1 and Th2 type have the capacity to induce mIL-1, suggesting that this function is not limited to the T cell subset (Th2) that is able to use IL-1. Most importantly, the ability of T cells to induce IL-1 on macrophages seems to occur by virtue of direct cellular interactions, and is independent of lymphokine secretion. The induction event is rapid enough (2 to 4 h) to allow T cells to interact with both antigen and IL-1 during the initial T cell/macrophage contact. These findings thus reveal an efficient mechanism for the induction of IL-1 during Ag presentation to T cells.\r"

Although crude Triton X-100 soluble material obtained from T cell pellets contains minimal PKC activity, DEAE chromatography revealed that 12 to 37% of cellular PKC was membrane associated, probably due to removal of an inhibitor through column chromatography. As in other tissues, PKC from lymphoid tissue was phospholipid and Ca2+ dependent and diolein reduced the Ca2+ requirements for enzyme activity. Hydroxylapatite chromatography revealed that T cells possess two major peaks of PKC activity. Although, the enzyme in these peaks had similar m.w. and identical iso-electric mobility, the proteins differed with respect to their autophosphorylation sites and immunoreactivity toward an isoform specific antibody. Furthermore, differences in their activities in the presence of phospholipid, diolein, and limiting amounts of Ca2+ imply that these isoforms may be differentially activated. We discuss optimal conditions for activation of PKC and its isoforms for study of T lymphocyte cellular function.\r"

N-terminal sequencing of the purified proteins revealed that the 50-kDa homodimer is the gene product of the human Hanukah factor cDNA clone and that it represents the human homologue to granzyme A. Similarly, the 27-kDa protein was shown to be the serine esterase encoded by the human lymphocyte protease cDNA clone and corresponds to granzyme B. There was no evidence for the presence of other granzymes, in particular for the human homologues to murine granzymes C, D, E, and F. The substrate best cleaved by granzyme A was Gly-Pro-Arg-amido-4-methyl-coumarin after the Arg residue and the pH optimum was 8 to 8.5. Upon triggering of the TCR-CD3 complex with an anti-CD3 mAb, granzyme A was released into the culture medium. Furthermore, a granule-associated hemolytic activity was detected after salt extraction and partial purification of granule proteins. This suggests that hemolytically active human perforin can be obtained from inactive granules.\r"

Approximately half of the LPS released by the action of serum (S-LPS) exists in association with serum proteins in a lower m.w. form than that manifest in phenol-water extracted LPS preparations. The two major LPS-serum protein complexes have apparent Mr of 68 and 32 kDa. The LPS subunit heterogeneity of S-LPS, however, does not appear to differ significantly from LPS retained on the bacteria after serum treatment, or from LPS derived by lysis of whole cells. The biologic activities of S-LPS and phenol-water extracted LPS examined in these studies, differed significantly. In contrast to phenol-water extracted LPS, S-LPS was 1) reduced in lethal toxicity for sensitized mice; 2) reduced in Limulus reactivity; 3) a more potent murine splenocyte mitogen; 4) reduced in the capacity to elicit extracellular, but not membrane-associated IL-1; and 5) reduced in the ability to mediate TNF production. These data suggest that humoral \"detoxification\" of LPS may involve, in part, the formation of LPS-serum protein complexes with reduced capacities to elicit extracellular cytokine production, whereas the immunomodulatory effects of LPS appear to be enhanced.\r"

Similarly, stimulation of murine Thy-1 or Ly-6 with mAb also results in activation of both of these kinase pathways. Tyrosine phosphorylation in all cases occurs on the TCR zeta-chain. It is known that Ag and anti-receptor antibodies activate PKC in human T cells. In this study we demonstrate that mitogen or anti-CD3 antibodies activate tyrosine phosphorylation of the human TCR-zeta-chain. PMA, which activates PKC, does not result in zeta-chain tyrosine phosphorylation. Stimulation of human T cells by antibodies that bind the CD2 molecule is an alternate mode of inducing T cell proliferation. These antibodies surprisingly do not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the zeta-chain. Thus, different methods of cellular activation can result in distinguishable patterns of receptor-mediated biochemical signaling events.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms responsible for immune responses to toxoplasma Ag we used a highly purified membrane protein (P30) of T. gondii to stimulate an in vitro Ag-specific cytotoxic T cell response. P30 immune mouse splenocytes reduced extracellular T. gondii plaque-forming units by more than 50% when incubated at an E/T ratio of 10:1 or greater. By using a [3H]uracil radioisotope release assay, the effect of the immune splenocytes was determined to be a direct parasite lytic mechanism. The immune splenocytes were P30 Ag specific and of the Thy 1.2, Lyt2,3+ (CD4-, CD8+) phenotype, specific for mouse cytotoxic T cells. Opsonization of the parasites with monoclonal P30-reactive mAb did not enhance parasiticidal activity. Culture supernatants obtained during the 2-h cytotoxic assay were not parasiticidal, and anti-asialo-GM1 antibody plus C did not destroy the parasiticidal activity of the P30 responder cells. Accordingly, we have identified an Ag-specific subset of CD4-, CD8+, P30 responder T cells that are directly parasiticidal to extracellular T. gondii, and that exhibit cytotoxicity independent of antibody opsonization, lymphokine secretion, NK cell activity, and, apparently, MHC involvement as well.\r"

Although a non-particulate form of HBcAg designated hepatitis B e Ag (HBeAg) shares significant amino acid identity, the immune responses to these Ag appear to be regulated independently. This report describes the use of recombinant HBcAg and HBeAg to examine and compare murine T cell and B cell recognition of these related Ag. The HBcAg preparation was stable at pH 7.2 and 9.6 and expressed HBc antigenicity. However, the antigenicity of the HBeAg preparation was pH dependent. At pH 9.6 the HBeAg preparation was non-particulate and expressed HBe antigenicity exclusively; however, at pH 7.2 it was particulate and expressed both HBc and HBe antigenicities. Although this \"hybrid\" particle most likely does not exist naturally, it is a unique research reagent to investigate the interrelationship between HBcAg and HBeAg. HBcAg was significantly more immunogenic in terms of in vivo antibody production as compared to either the non-particulate or particulate forms of HBeAg. Nevertheless, in most murine strains HBcAg and HBeAg were equivalently immunogenic and crossreactive at the level of T cell activation. The disparity between anti-HBc and anti-HBe antibody production is best explained by the observation that HBcAg can function as a T cell-independent Ag whereas HBeAg is T cell dependent even when present within the same particulate structure as HBcAg. Furthermore, HBcAg was shown to function efficiently as an immunologic carrier moiety for the DNP hapten in athymic as well as euthymic mice in contrast to conventional carrier proteins. These results have implications relevant to the human immune responses to HBcAg and HBeAg during infection, and to vaccine development.\r"

  ".W": "The investigational drug flavone acetic acid (FAA) has been previously shown to systemically augment NK activity in vivo in normal mice within 24 h of i.p. or i.v. administration. The current study investigates the ability of FAA, and/or rIL-2, to augment NK activity and antitumor responses in mice bearing murine renal cancer (Renca). The results demonstrate that FAA potently augments NK activity in the blood, spleen, and liver of Renca-bearing mice and that the administration of rIL-2 in addition to FAA results in a further augmentation of NK activity over that observed with FAA alone. Renca-bearing mice treated with FAA (200 to 250 mg/kg) plus rIL-2 exhibited a significantly increased incidence of long term survivors (59%) over that observed following treatment with FAA (0%) or rIL-2 (5%) alone. Therapeutic synergy between FAA and rIL-2 was observed against primary tumors, minimal residual disease, and experimental-induced pulmonary metastases. Mice cured of Renca by FAA plus rIL-2 treatment were largely resistant to rechallenge with Renca suggesting a role for T lymphocytes. The augmentation of NK activity and the therapeutic effects of FAA coincided with the rapid induction of high titers of serum IFN of the alpha/beta type within 4 h of FAA administration. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the contribution of FAA could be partially replaced by the administration of several doses of human rIFN-alpha A/D Bg1 before the initiation of rIL-2 administration. The observed synergistic antitumor effects of FAA plus rIL-2 coincided with the augmentation of NK activity, induction of IFN-alpha/beta, and induction of long lasting tumor immunity. Overall, these results suggest that this approach may obviate the need for adoptive immunotherapy in association with rIL-2 administration for at least some tumor types.\r"

  ".W": "A comparative study of immune functions of CD4+8- T cells isolated from normal and athymic nude mice by electronic cell sorting was performed. Athymic nude CD4+8- T cells expressed the TCR-associated CD3 molecule but the level of expression was significantly lower than that of normal CD4+8- T cells. Proliferative responses were studied upon stimulation by 1) the T cell mitogen Con A; 2) anti-CD3 mediated cross-linking of the CD3:TCR complex, and 3) the combined action of PMA + ionomycin. All three mitogenic stimuli caused readily detectable cell division in normal (euthymic) CD4+8- T cells. In marked contrast, none of the mitogenic stimuli induced significant proliferation in athymic nude CD4+8- T cells. The failure of athymic nude CD4+8- T cells to proliferate occurred over a wide range of mitogen concentrations and over a 4-day observation period. Neither exogenously supplied rIL-2 or mixed lymphocyte culture supernatant had any effect on the impaired proliferative response by athymic nude CD4+8- T cells. Although IL-2 was produced by athymic nude CD4+8- T cells at a reduced level when compared to normal CD4+8- T cells, it was nevertheless readily detected upon stimulation with either Con A or anti-CD3. Furthermore, stimulation of athymic nude CD4+8- T cells by anti-CD3 induced the expression of the p55 chain of IL-2R on the cell surface. Therefore, despite production of IL-2 and induced expression of IL-2R, athymic nude CD4+8- T cells failed to undergo cell division.\r"

  ".W": "Stem cell Ag 1 and 2 (Sca-1 and Sca-2), so named due to their expression by mouse bone marrow stem cells, were evaluated for expression by populations of cells within the thymus. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that Sca-1 was expressed by cells in the thymic medulla and by some subcapsular blast cells, as well as by the thymic blood vessels and capsule. Sca-2 expression, which was limited to the thymic cortex, could be associated with large cycling thymic blast cells. Both Sca-1 and Sca-2 were expressed on a sub-population of CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and this subpopulation was entirely contained within the Ly-1lo progenitor fraction of cells. Sca-1 expression by a phenotypically mature subset of CD4+CD8- thymocytes was also noted. Conversely, Sca-2 expression was observed on a phenotypically immature or nonmature subpopulation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes. MEL-14, an antibody that defines functional expression of a lymphocyte homing molecule, identified a small population of thymocytes that contained all four major thymic subsets. Sca-2 split the MEL-14hi thymocyte subset into two Sca-2+ non-mature/immature phenotype fractions and two Sca-2- mature phenotype fractions. In peripheral lymphoid organs, Sca-1 identified a sub-population of mature T lymphocytes that is predominantly CD4+CD8-, in agreement with the thymic distribution of Sca-1. Peripheral T cells of the CD4-CD8+ phenotype were predominantly Sca-1-. In contrast, Sca-2 did not appear to stain peripheral T lymphocytes, but recognized only a subset of B lymphocytes which could be localized by immunohistochemistry to germinal centers. Thus, expression of Sca-1 is observed throughout T cell ontogeny, whereas Sca-2 is expressed by some subsets of thymocytes, including at least one half of thymic blasts, but not by mature peripheral T lymphocytes.\r"

The lines were obtained by cultivation of BALB/c splenic T cells with T15 Id+ stimulator cells BCg3R-1d, a BALB/c lymphoma transfected with genomic sequences mu and kappa with S107 (T15) variable regions. Resulting Thyl-2+, L3T4+ cell lines depend on the T15 Id+ BCg3R-1d cells for growth and demonstrate the ability to bind TEPC15, a S107 germline-encoded, PC-specific Ig alpha. The specificity of the 125I-TEPC15 binding was studied in a competitive RIA with various unlabeled Ig. The isolated H and L chains of TEPC15 failed to inhibit the 125I-TEPC15 binding, and the T15-, PC-binding proteins M603 (alpha) and M511 (alpha) inhibited the binding either poorly or not at all. Moreover, the T cell lines had a discriminatory binding specificity for various T15+ Ig that are somatic variants of TEPC15 and that differ from each other in discrete, conformational Id (epitopes) detectable with specific monoclonal anti-Id. The T cell lines could be grouped according to their binding patterns, which were comparable to the recognition patterns of certain monoclonal anti-Id. These data suggest the existence of T cells with specificity for serologically-defined determinants of syngeneic idiotypes.\r"

In an attempt to further delineate the mechanism of action of CsA, we have examined its effects on T cell proliferation induced by the combination of the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. T cells were rendered competent as the result of a 30-min initial incubation with both drugs, after which the drugs were washed out. Competence is defined as the ability to subsequently proliferate in response to exogenously added IL-2 or PDB in the second phase of the culture, but not to synthesize IL-2 or proliferate without these additions. Addition of CsA (1 microgram/ml) to the cells in the initial, competence-inducing 30-min incubation with PDB/ionomycin abrogated their subsequent response to IL-2 or PDB. In contrast, addition of CsA to cells after they had been treated for 30 min with PDB/ionomycin and then washed did not affect their responses to subsequent addition of either IL-2 or PDB. Treatment with CsA during induction of competence prevented the expression of the 55-kDa IL-2R gene during competence induction and inhibited IL-2 gene expression and IL-2 production in response to PDB in the second phase. These results indicate that the effects of CsA are limited to the initiation (competence induction) period of T cell activation, that CsA apparently affects expression of more than one gene, and in competent cells, CsA does not affect their ability to progress to DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the developmental pattern and diversity of murine cluster of differentiation (CD)3-associated TCR-gamma delta heterodimers, adult and fetal thymocytes were examined for cell-surface expression of various gamma- and delta-encoded TCR. Biochemical analysis, using antisera specific for distinct C gamma gene products, revealed the presence of T cells expressing C gamma 1 and/or C gamma 4 heterodimers in adult and fetal CD4- CD8- thymocyte populations. Although CD4-CD8- thymocyte populations express both C gamma 1 and C gamma 4 TCR-gamma delta heterodimers early in fetal thymus development, the relative level of C gamma 4-expressing T cells was significantly lower than previously observed in peripheral lymphoid organs. In addition, biochemical studies revealed the presence of TCR-gamma delta heterodimer(s) expressed during fetal ontogeny which were not detected in adult thymocyte or peripheral lymphoid populations. Studies of N-glycosylation patterns of one of these heterodimers suggested that it contained a rearranged V gamma 3/C gamma 1 gene product. To examine in detail individual TCR-gamma delta heterodimers, a panel of TCR-gamma delta expressing hybridomas was prepared. Biochemical analysis at the clonal level revealed that indeed three distinct TCR-gamma delta heterodimers were present at day 16 of fetal thymus development, with TCR-gamma-chains most likely encoded by V gamma 2/C gamma 1, V gamma 3/C gamma 1, and V gamma/C gamma 4. Together these findings suggest an ordered development of TCR-gamma delta T cells in the thymus and selective expression of distinct TCR-gamma delta subsets in peripheral lymphoid organs such as spleen and lymph nodes.\r"

The inhibition of ecto-5'NT activity by biochemical (alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5-diphosphate; AOPCP) or immunologic inhibitors (polyclonal anti-ecto-5'NT serum) suppressed the proliferative and cytotoxic activation of CTL against a lymphoblastic B cell line in primary one-way MLC. The kinetic analysis of suppression showed that AOPCP and anti-5'NT serum had different effects: AOPCP suppressed only the activation of the cytotoxic program whereas anti-5'NT serum suppressed also recognition and binding to the stimulatory/target cell. Inhibition of CTL generation was not a metabolic consequence of the purine salvage blockade. Incubation of AOPCP-treated MLC with hypoxanthine restored proliferation but not cytotoxicity. The ecto-5'NT inhibitors used had no general toxic effect on cell numbers or viability. AOPCP selectively affected CTL generation and displayed no activity against mitogen-induced proliferation, activation of Ts cells, and generation of IL-2-activated killer cells. These data indicate that ecto-5'NT has a critical role in the functional activation of alloreactive CTL.\r"

Using a technique of quantitating the relative proportions of fluorescent-positive cells present in tissue sections, we found at 8.5 wk of gestational age after arrival of CD7+ T cell precursors into the thymic rudiment, 60% of thymic CD7+ cells were CD2+, 4% were CD3+ and none was TCR-delta+ or TCR beta+. Moreover, cells reactive with anti-CD2 antibodies against T11(2) and T11(3) epitopes of CD2 as well as thymic stromal cells expressing the CD2 ligand, lymphocyte function associated Ag-3, were also present at 8.5 wk. From 9.5 wk to birth TCR beta+ cells increased to include greater than 90% of all CD7+ cells while TCR-delta+ cells fell from a peak of 11% of CD7+ cells at 9.5 wk to 1% of CD7+ cells at birth. These data suggest that epitopes of CD2 molecules are expressed early on during fetal thymic development. Moreover, these data suggest that CD7+, CD2+, cytoplasmic CD3+ T cell precursors in man give rise to both TCR-delta+ T cells as well as to T cells expressing TCR-alpha beta.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the avidity of human CTL in the recognition and lysis of murine P815 cells expressing HLA-B27.1 Ag has been examined. Seven B27-specific alloreactive CTL clones were tested for their ability to lyse a B27.1+-P815 transfectant clone 1-7E, obtained after cotransfection of P815-HTR cells with HLA-B27.1 and human beta 2-microglobulin genes. The expression level of HLA-B27.1 on 1-7E cells was comparable to that on a human lymphoblastoid cell line, as determined by flow cytometry. Of the seven CTL clones used, CTL 1, 26, and 29 displayed the same fine specificity as established with a panel of target cells expressing six structurally different HLA-B27 variants. However, CTL 1 and 29 were of higher avidity than CTL 26, in that the lysis of human target cells by only this latter clone was inhibited by an anti-CD8 mAb. Based on the same criteria, CTL 2, 15, and 48 possessed the same or very similar fine specificity, but CTL 48 was of higher avidity than CTL 2 or 15. The seventh clone, CTL 40, was of a different fine specificity and its lysis of human target cells was also inhibited by the same anti-CD8 mAb. Only those clones whose lysis of human targets could not be inhibited by anti-CD8 antibody were able to lyse the 1-7E murine transfectants. These results indicate that, for human CTL clones with identical or very similar fine specificity, only those of higher avidity are able to lyse P815 murine cells expressing the HLA-B27 antigen. The lysis of HLA-B27.1+-murine transfectants by relevant clones was inhibited by anti-CD8 antibody. This result strongly suggests that the relative contribution of CD8 in stabilizing the interaction between human CTL and HLA-B27+-murine target cells is more significant than with human target cells.\r"

  ".W": "The humoral response to the p-azobenzenearsonate hapten in the A/J mouse includes the major cross-reactive idiotype associated with anti-p-azobenzenearsonate (CRIA) found in all immunized mice. Limiting dilution cultures of non-immunized spleen cells of A/J mice with irradiated B hybridoma cells bearing the Ig idiotype, CRIA, in the presence of T cell growth factors developed cytotoxic activity against the CRIA-bearing hybridoma; in some wells this activity was completely abrogated by an anti-idiotype mAb specific for CRIA or by a univalent hapten antigen, tyrosine-p-azobenzenearsonate, indicating the existence of cytotoxic T cell precursors (CTL-P) specific for one or more idiotopes of CRIA in normal spleen cells. The CTL clones lysed targets in a H-2D-restricted manner and were cytotoxic for CRIA-bearing hybridoma lines, but not for CRIA-non-bearing, IgG1k-bearing hybridoma lines. These CTL-P were detected at a high frequency (1/4,500 to 1/10,000) in a spleen cell population of non-immunized, relatively aged A/J mice (16 to 30 wk of age), and at a lower frequency in spleen cells of younger A/J mice (8 wk of age). However, they were not detected in normal spleen cells of B10.A (CRIA-non-producer) mice at any age (less than 1/6 x 10(5)). Normal Ighd-congenic C.AL-20 mice (16 wk of age), that are CRIA producers had as a high frequency of the CTL-P as did A/J mice, whereas normal Ighb-congenic C.B-20 mice (CRIA-non-producers) had none. In the spleen cells of the CRIA-producers, cytotoxicity of the CTL-P developed only in cultures with small numbers of seeding cells. They were completely absent in cultures with greater numbers of cells; this may be due to the presence of suppressor cells of lower frequency but greater potency. In lymph node cells or PBL of relatively aged A/J mice, the CTL-P were also detected, but only in cultures containing higher cell numbers, and at low frequency (between 1/5 x 10(5) to 1/2 x 10(6)). In thymocytes of 8-wk-old A/J mice, they were occasionally detected at very low frequency (less than or equal to 1/1 x 10(6)), but were not present in the bone marrow cells at any age. These results demonstrate the high incidence of the generation of CTL-P specific for an autologous Ag, and indicate that CRIA on B cells may induce CTL specific for CRIA. However, the development of CTL-P may be inhibited by co-existent suppressor cells under normal conditions.\r"

This expression of IL-2R alpha-chain on some DN thymocytes in the mouse has led to the proposal that IL-2 might serve as a principal growth and/or differentiation factor for immature thymocytes. However, previous histologic observations have indicated that IL-2R alpha-chain is not expressed on the subcapsular thymic blasts (an area rich in DN cells) in either huma or rat thymus, whereas all three species display IL-2R expression on a few cells in the thymic medulla. Therefore, we characterized rat DN thymocytes to determine whether they contained an IL-2R+ population. The results show that rat thymic DN cells share several characteristics with mouse DN cells. However, most of the rat strains do not express the IL-2R on DN cells as shown either by immunofluorescence or by IL-2 binding and receptor cross-linking. Thus, the rare medullary IL-2R+ cells were not found in the DN cells. Only in the exceptional F344 rat strain is the IL-2R alpha-chain expressed on a major proportion of thymocytes, including both DN cells and small cortical-type thymocytes. Furthermore, rat DN cells do not contain detectable IL-2 mRNA or cytoplasmic IL-2 activity, thus supporting the conclusion that it is unlikely that IL-2 and IL-2R serve to maintain the proliferation of rat DN thymocytes in vivo. The possible significance of in vivo expression of IL-2R alpha-chain on immature thymocytes in the mouse and in a single rat strain is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We explored antigenic differences between guinea pig (GP)-basic protein (BP), rat (Rt)-BP, and respective peptides from the encephalitogenic region for Lewis rats by comparing the fine specificity of T lymphocyte lines and clones selected from animals primed with these Ag. Encephalitogenic T cell lines specific for GP-BP or Rt-BP predictably recognized the corresponding 72-89 and to a lesser degree the 72-84 (S55S) amino acid sequence. T cell lines selected from rats primed with GP-S55S responded preferentially to GP-S55S compared to other peptides. A T cell line raised to Rt-S55S, however, initially recognized the S55S and S72-89 peptides but were nearly unresponsive to the intact GP-BP or Rt-BP. T cell clones selected from the Rt-S55S line at that point had two distinct patterns of response: clones that recognized both of the BP and the S55S peptides adoptively transferred delayed-type hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These clones also recognized residues 69-81 (S67) but not peptide S75-89. In contrast, T cell clones that responded only to synthetic peptides GP-S55S and Rt-S55S but not to the parent BP adoptively transferred delayed-type hypersensitivity but not disease in Lewis rats. The same clones failed to respond to either the S67 or the S75-89 sequences. These results demonstrate that the encephalitogenic Rt-S55S sequence houses a minimum of two T cell epitopes with differing specificities and functions. One epitope is immuno-dominant and resembles the encephalitogenic region of the intact BP molecule. The second non-encephalitogenic epitope is restricted to the S55S sequences and is not shared by the parent BP, the S67, or the S75-89 sequences. Both types of Rt-S55S-specific clones differ in fine specificity from encephalitogenic clones selected from GP-BP immunized rats, thus indicating that uniformity of T cell recognition of the encephalitogenic epitope is not an absolute condition for T cells to be encephalitogenic.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Ts cells in murine allopregnancy decidua release potent immunosuppressor factors in vitro that block the action of IL-2. Previous studies have shown that both primary and secondary CTL responses are inhibited as well as the generation of Il-2 activated killer cells. In this paper we show that the suppressor factor(s) can arrest ongoing IL-2 dependent CTL responses but does not block binding of anti-IL-2R antibody or radiolabeled IL-2 to the IL-2R. The suppressive activity is associated with molecules that adhere to hydroxylapatite and con A-agarose but do not bind to activated charcoal or partition as lipids. HPLC TSK 3000 separation showed a major peak of suppressive activity at 60 to 100 kDa, with additional activity at 300 kDa, and at less than 1000. Under acid conditions, suppressive activity resolved as a major peak at 13 kDa with some residual activity at 65 kDa and at less than or equal to 1000. A specific rabbit IgG antibody to transforming growth factor-beta neutralized suppressor activity in unseparated supernatant and in the 13-kDa fraction whereas neutralizing antibodies to progesterone or PGE-2 did not affect suppression but could neutralize their respective ligands. Inasmuch as transforming growth factor-beta has a 25 kDa Mr, the 13-kDa decidua-associated suppressor factor would appear to represent a related but distinct regulatory molecule that associates with a variety of carrier molecules.\r"

The bioactivity of the hybrid molecule was comparable to that of normal human rIL-2 in assays measuring T cell proliferation, and in generation of lymphokine-activated killer cells from PBL. Furthermore, the addition of the lysine-rich segment made the molecule more amenable to the chemical derivatization of amino groups. After biotinylation, IL-2-L retained a greater proportion of its bioactivity than normal rIL-2. In addition, biotinylated IL-2-L was capable of simultaneously binding to cell surface IL-2R and streptavidin. Thus, the addition of the lysine-rich oligopeptide facilitated the generation of an active form of biotinylated IL-2 which acts as a bridge between IL-2R-positive cells and avidin-coupled reagents and affinity supports. Such a selective means of labeling and binding IL-2-responsive cells may have great practical utility for IL-2-based immunotherapy.\r"

In this report, we demonstrate that 1) IL-1 production is a common property of murine T cell clones, 2) T cell IL-1 activity is blocked by anti-IL-1-alpha antiserum, 3) IL-1-alpha mRNA can be directly visualized in individual cloned T cells using in situ hybridization techniques, and 4) IL-1 appears to serve an autocrine role in the activation of T cell clones inasmuch as anti-IL-1-alpha antiserum blocks cell proliferation when the T cell is the only IL-1 source.\r"

Here, we report that IL-6 represents part of the monocyte-derived helper activity for human T cell stimulation with PHA. Resting T cells isolated from peripheral blood or tonsils and completely depleted of accessory cells (monocytes and NK cells) did not proliferate in response to PHA alone. Addition of a cell-free monocyte culture supernatant (not containing IL-2) to the PHA-stimulated cultures resulted in T cell proliferation. We identified IL-6 as an essential helper factor in these monocyte supernatants, because antisera to IL-6 (but not anti-IL-1-beta) completely neutralized the helper effect of the monocyte supernatant. Moreover, addition of purified human IL-6 (but not IL-1-beta) to T cell cultures resulted in proliferation of PHA-stimulated T cells. Although IL-1 could not restore the PHA-induced proliferative response of isolated T cells by itself, it strongly enhanced the helper effect of IL-6. In contrast to intact monocytes, IL-6 did not induce detectable IL-2 production in cultures of PHA-stimulated T cells. Furthermore, an anti-IL-2R mAb (anti-Tac) did not block the proliferative response induced by PHA and IL-6, suggesting that an IL-2-independent pathway of T cell proliferation was involved. In conclusion our results show that human IL-6, previously identified as a B cell hybridoma growth and a B cell differentiation factor, represents part of the monocyte helper function for PHA-induced human T cell activation and proliferation.\r"

The sequence similarity in the coding region is about 60%, whereas the 3'-untranslated region and the first 300-bp sequence of the 5'-flanking region are highly conserved (greater than 80%). Several sequence blocks with high homology are also found in the introns. Furthermore, sequences similar to transcriptional enhancer elements such as the c-fos serum responsive element and the consensus sequences for cAMP induction, activator protein 1 binding, and the glucocorticoid receptor binding are identified within the highly conserved 5'-flanking regions of the genes from the two species. These sequences may play an important role in transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene.\r"

At sub-optimal or optimal doses of mitogens Bcgr mice were higher responders than their Bcgs counterparts. The superior response of Bcgr spleen cells to Con A was further investigated with the aim of identifying the population expressing this phenotype. T cells of either Bcgr or Bcgs type showed equal ability to respond to Con A in the presence of macrophages. Purified splenic macrophages from Bcgr mice contained a significantly greater percentage of Ia+-bearing macrophages compared to Bcgs mice. Splenic macrophages of the Bcgr type were more efficient than their Bcgs counterparts at restoring the Con A response of accessory cell-depleted spleen cells. Resident peritoneal macrophages as well as splenic dendritic cells from Bcgr and Bcgs mice were equally efficient at restoring this response. Glutaraldehyde-fixed Bcgr splenic macrophages were shown to be more efficient than the Bcgs cells at replenishing the response of Con A-unresponsive spleen cells when supplemented with IL-1.\r"

No LSP1 mRNA is found in myeloid cells or in liver, kidney, or heart tissue. Inspection of the predicted LSP1 protein sequence reveals the presence of two putative Ca2+-binding domains in the LSP1 protein. Southern blotting analysis of genomic DNA from mouse liver suggests that the LSP1 gene is present as one copy per haploid genome. Similar analysis of genomic DNA extracted from three transformed B cell lines and five transformed T cell lines shows that the absence of LSP1 mRNA in T cell lines is not due to deletion or gross rearrangements of the LSP1 locus. With the use of the mouse LSP1 cDNA as a probe we can detect a cross-hybridizing RNA species in four normal human functional T cell lines but not in three transformed human T cell lines. This suggests that at least part of the DNA sequence and the expression pattern of the LSP1 gene is conserved between mouse and man. These conserved features, together with the particular expression pattern and the protein sequence homologies, suggest that the LSP1 protein is involved in a Ca2+-dependent aspect of normal T cell growth.\r"

Two genes were constructed that encode novel molecules in which the effect of amino acid differences at residues 9, 43, and 95, or at residue 156 could be separately evaluated. Using both human and murine CTL that were specific for either HLA-A2.1 or HLA-A2.2, four types of epitopes were identified: 1) epitopes that were insensitive to substitutions at either residues 9, 43, and 95, or residue 156 but were lost when all four positions were changed; 2) epitopes that were dependent on the residues 9, 43, 95, but not residue 156; 3) epitopes that were dependent on residue 156, but not amino acid residues 9, 43, and 95; and 4) epitopes that were dependent on residues 9, 43, and 95, as well as amino acid residue 156. Overall, there was a roughly equal distribution of clones recognizing each of these types of epitopes. Additional molecules were constructed by hemi-exon shuffling between the HLA-A2.2 and HLA-A2.3 genes, and by site-directed mutagenesis, to analyze the epitopes recognized by two HLA-A2.2/A2.1 cross-reactive murine CTL that do not recognize HLA-A2.3. Although the epitopes recognized by these CTL were unaffected by changes occurring at residues 9, 43, and 95, or at residues 149, 152, and 156 alone, simultaneous changes in both of these regions acted in concert to destroy the epitopes. Both of the CTL recognized epitopes that were lost when substitutions were made at residues 9, 43, 95, 149, and 152. The epitope recognized by one of the CTL was also destroyed by the substitution of residues 9, 43, 95, 152, and 156. Overall, these results indicate that residues 9, 43, and 95, as well as residues in the alpha-helical region of the molecule, are all capable of contributing to the definition of the epitopes recognized by HLA-A2.1- and HLA-A2.2-specific CTL. They further indicate that some epitopes can be mapped to a particular region of the molecule, whereas other epitopes are formed through a complex interaction of residues in distant regions of the molecule.\r"

The polymorphic second exon of these genes was specifically amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction method, using the thermostable DNA polymerase of Thermus, aquaticus. The analysis of M13 clones containing the amplified DP-beta sequences revealed a total of 14 allelic variants. In general, specific allelic DP-beta sequences were associated with each of the defined DPw1-w6 types, with beta allele subtypes revealed for the DPw2 and DPw4 specificities. An additional six DP-beta alleles which did not correlate with any of the T cell-defined specificities (DP \"blanks\") were also identified. Only the two previously characterized alleles of DP-alpha were detected. These observations suggest that the T cell-defined DP specificities are determined by polymorphic residues on the beta-chain. The sequence polymorphisms in DP-beta are clustered in a few specific regions, and can be detected using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes and polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA in a rapid dot-blot format. This approach provides a simple and informative method of DP typing. The DP-beta sequences derived from four DP-typed celiac disease patients were compared with the distribution of DP-beta alleles in control individuals.\r"

In this study, we have completed a more detailed and longer time course evaluation of PDGF-mediated human NK cell inhibition, and demonstrate a more marked inhibition of human NK cells at 8 to 20 h as compared to 2 h. We also show that either rIFN-alpha or IL-2 reverses the PDGF-mediated NK cell inhibition; and furthermore, that PDGF does not inhibit the lymphokine augmented NK activity of recombinant alpha-IFN or IL-2-activated human NK cells. In addition, we have further demonstrated that PDGF does not inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity as generated in the MLR, nor does PDGF significantly inhibit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Finally, we have demonstrated that human NK cells have roughly 12,000 high-affinity, surface binding sites for PDGF, as determined by the competitive binding of 125I-labeled purified PDGF and unlabeled PDGF to B73.1+ FACS-sorted lymphoid (NK) cells, and Scatchard analysis of these data.

Understanding the in vivo distribution of LAK cells should help to optimize their antitumor efficacy. As a model system to examine this issue, nylon wool column-passed rat lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of rIL-2 for 1 and 2 days. The resulting cells were divided into two populations; one that adhered to the plastic flasks and the second which did not adhere. The adherent cells were found to be highly cytotoxic against NK-sensitive and NK-resistant targets, whereas the nonadherent cells were unable to kill NK-resistant targets unless T cells were removed from this population. These results indicate that T cells present in IL-2 activated bulk splenocytes may interfere with the activity of LAK cells. Adherent or nonadherent LAK cells were evaluated for their pattern of in vivo distribution after i.v. inoculation. These cells were found to display a restricted pattern of distribution, localizing mainly in the lungs at 2 h after i.v. injection but redistributing into the liver and the spleen by 24 h. LAK cells were rarely recovered from the lymphoid tissues, including the peripheral lymph nodes and the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, if T cells were not removed from the LAK cell population, some radioactivity was recovered from the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes. Fractionation of 2 day-activated, nonadherent population on discontinuous Percoll resulted in the enrichment of large granular lymphocyte (LGL)/LAK activity in low density fractions (42% and 45% Percoll), whereas high density fraction (70% Percoll) contained T cells which showed no cytolytic activity. Upon transfer into syngeneic rats, the 42% fraction showed typical LAK migration. In contrast, the 70% fraction showed typical T cell migration. What is more important, removal of the granulated cells resulted in a population which have no granules and resemble large agranular lymphocytes known to be pre-LGL/LAK cells. Large agranular lymphocytes showed a pattern of distribution different from both T and LGL/LAK cells.\r"

  ".W": "A shock-like syndrome was induced in rabbits by administering toxic-shock-syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1); tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like activity was detected in sera of rabbits 3.5 h after injection, as measured by cytotoxic effects on the tumorigenic L929 murine fibroblast cell line. Appearance of this activity in sera coincided with onset of significant shock-related hemodynamic changes. TSST-1 stimulated release of TNF-like material from rabbit mononuclear cells in culture. Human mononuclear cells also secreted a cytotoxic substance shown to be TNF by radioimmunoassay. Maximal TNF secretion was higher in human mononuclear cells stimulated with TSST-1 than in those stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide, however, was a more potent inducer of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta from the same cells than was TSST-1. Because TNF and interleukin-1 act synergistically during induction of a shock-like state, these results suggest that part of the TSST-1-induced shock is due to production of interleukin-1 and TNF.\r"

Adherent mononuclear cells were stimulated with TSST-1 and their supernatants assayed for TNF by using L929 cells in a cytotoxicity assay. TSST-1 stimulated production of TNF over a wide range of concentrations. The cytotoxicity of monocyte supernatants was neutralized by antibody to TNF but not by antibody to interleukin-1 or by normal rabbit serum. TSST-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) had a synergistic effect on monokine production. Monocytes \"primed\" with TSST-1 produced more interleukin-1 and TNF in response to LPS than did unprimed cells. Treating monocytes with LPS before TSST-1 and co-incubating the two agents with cells for 24 h also enhanced monokine production under some circumstances. These studies suggest a role for TNF in the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome, as a consequence of induction by TSST-1 alone or the synergistic effects of several bacterial products.\r"

The antibody response of the newborns was defined by disease duration and correlated with disease classification and outcome. Three unique observations were made. First, the quantity of total antibodies at presentation, as determined by ELISA and neutralization, was not predictive of disease classification or outcome. Second, the frequency and intensity of antibody responses to immunologically recognized HSV polypeptides in newborns with central nervous system and disseminated infections were greater than those in newborns with infections localized to the skin, eye, and mouth. Third, the long-term outcome in HSV-infected newborns could be predicted by the quantity of antibodies to the immediate-early infected cell polypeptide ICP 4. These data provide insight into host response to individual polypeptides and their potential value in predicting long-term prognosis.\r"

The determined constants allow the use of S-2302 and S-2366 in an assay that leads to the joint estimation of factor XI and prekallikrein in activated plasma. The assay reports approximately 3.1 micrograms/ml factor XIa and 34.5 micrograms/ml kallikrein in kaolin-activated plasma (kaolin content 2 mg/ml). The dual-substrate amidolytic assay shows good correlation with the coagulant assay of both factors (0.92 with the prekallikrein assay and 0.98 with the factor XI assay). It is capable, through the joint estimation of factor XI and prekallikrein levels, of differentiating among plasma samples deficient in components of the contact phase of blood coagulation. Kinetic constants of factor beta-XIIa (factor XII fragment) for these substrates and for N-benzol-L-isoleusyl-L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine-P-nitro ani lide (S-2222) were determined, and they allowed the assessment of the contribution of this factor to this assay and its estimation in the activated phase.\r"

All subjects had normal hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses at days 14 and 42 after vaccination, with no significant differences noted between patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. However, subjects with HLA haplotypes DR 3, DR 4, or both had lower antibody responses to influenza A/Chile and B/USSR at 14 days after vaccination (p less than 0.02) than DR x/x controls (who lacked 3 or 4). Lymphocyte transformation (LT) responses before and after vaccination were similar for patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. Of significance was that subjects with HLA haplotypes DR 3, DR 4, or both had 41.1% LT responders at 42 days after vaccination, compared with subjects with HLA-DR x/x (lacking 3 or 4) who had 22.6% responders (p less than 0.03), when influenza A/Chile was used as an antigen. Although not significant, influenza antigens A/Philippines and B/USSR each showed similar trends with increased postvaccine LT responses. The HLA associations were independent of sex, age, and the presence of diabetes. These studies suggest that HLA haplotypes DR 3 and DR 4, which were clearly linked to type 1 diabetes mellitus, were also associated with altered immune responsiveness to influenza viral proteins.\r"

Ten of the 11 clones were cytotoxic against the autologous tumor cell line GI-1. Seven of the 10 clones were also cytotoxic against allogeneic brain-tumor lines and HeLa cells, one clone was cytotoxic against several target cells, and two clones were specifically cytotoxic against GI-1 and allogeneic brain-tumor cells. One of the 11 clones was not cytotoxic against any target cells tested. Lymphokine-activated killer cells induced by recombinant interleukin-2 alone exhibited cytotoxic activity against all target tumor cells tested. Surface phenotypic analysis revealed that all lymphocyte clones expressed CD3 antigen, some expressed CD4 antigen, and others expressed CD8 antigen. These clones seemed to be antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones. Analysis with these antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones may be useful in the elucidation of tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens on autologous tumor cells.\r"

A method for volume determination using a threshold algorithm was calibrated against phantoms and applied to 60 patient studies. Good reproducibility was found using different projections and computing the volume on separate days. Variations of the measured volumes with the threshold value, reconstruction filter cutoff frequency and attenuation correction were investigated. Reconstruction parameters producing best image quality were also determined. A threshold of 25% of the maximum value in the organ was determined from phantom studies. Changes of 1% around this value yielded changes of 2-3% in the computed volume. No significant change was noted as cutoff frequencies varied between 0.4 and 0.85 of Nyquist (0.031 to 0.066 cycles/cm) for a third order Butterworth filter. Attenuation correction produced a decrease of 9% and 6% in liver and spleen measured volume respectively. Best image quality was obtained with 0.4 Nyquist (0.031 cycles/cm) cutoff frequency for third order Butterworth filter and attenuation correction. It is concluded that optimal parameters must be determined for any processing protocol, and must then be adhered to in future applications to insure clinical accuracy, especially those parameters demonstrating the most quantitative and qualitative sensitivity.\r"

Quantitative autoradiography was performed on two of these combinations (131I-B72.3/colorectal carcinoma and 131I-LYM-1/Raji B-cell lymphoma) to obtain a correlation of film density with radiolabeled antibody distribution. Through the use of sectioned mini-thermoluminescent dosimeter(s) (TLD) or micro-TLD, isodose curves were generated from the film gradient density lines. A computer program was written to compare theoretical absorbed dose calculations to measured micro-TLD values. First-order agreement was reached for both antibody/tumor systems: (a) B72.3/colorectal system--810 cGy measured/824 cGy calculated per 200 microCi injected and (b) LYM-1/lymphoma system--1,740 cGy measured/1,580 cGy calculated per 656 microCi injected (1 cGy = 1 rad). Additionally, the measured absorbed dose heterogeneity over a 500-micron length of up to 400% which suggests that the use of quantitative autoradiography is necessary in order to correctly determine the underlying radiobiological effects of RIT. Theoretical computer modeling based on similar autoradiographic activity distributions has also provided a convenient means of assessing absorbed dose variation patterns from other radiolabels such as 90Y.\r"

In contrast, in men, inferior wall counts are normally decreased compared to anterior counts. The purpose of this report is to describe cases of inferior wall attenuation of counts in women caused by peritoneal fluid, not myocardial disease. Twelve consecutive SPECT thallium myocardial studies performed in women on peritoneal dialysis, being evaluated for kidney transplant, were included in this study. For all studies, 3.5 mCi 201Tl were injected intravenously. Thirty-two images were acquired over 180 degrees (45 degrees RAO progressing to 45 degrees LPO) at 40 sec per stop. SPECT images were reviewed in short axis, horizontal long and vertical long axes. Data were also displayed in \"bullseye\" format with quantitative comparison to gender-matched normal files. Ten of 12 female patients studied had inferior wall defects on images, confirmed by bullseye display. All patients had approximately 2 liters of peritoneal fluid. Review of planar rotational views showed diaphragm elevation and fluid margin attenuations affecting left ventricular inferior wall. Thus, peritoneal fluid is a cause of inferior attenuation on 201Tl cardiac imaging.\r"

Since 1970, children were given monovalent pertussis vaccine at 5 and 9 weeks and at 10 months of age. A total of 554 cases of epilepsy with onset between 28 days and 24 months of age were reviewed, 286 from the 1967-1968 period and 268 from the 1972-1973 period. There was no relationship between the age of onset of epilepsy and the scheduled age of administration of pertussis vaccine. A total of 2199 children with febrile seizures were reviewed, 830 from the 1967-1968 period and 1369 from the 1972-1973 period. There was a statistical association between first febrile seizures and the scheduled age of administration of pertussis vaccine (p = 0.004). No relationship between pertussis immunization and the occurrence of central nervous system infections was noted.\r"

In vivo and in vitro assays of NICHD-Ptxd showed only trace or nondetectable levels of pyrogenic, adenosine diphosphate-ribosyltransferase, binding and pharmacologic activities. Nevertheless, about 40% of the antigenicity of pertussis toxin was retained. Adult volunteers were injected, two times 6 weeks apart, with either 10 (n = 21), 50 (n = 25), or 75 (n = 30) micrograms/dose of one lot, Ptx-06, adsorbed onto AI(OH)3. Neither fever nor changes in the levels of leukocytes, lymphocytes, fasting blood glucose, or insulin were observed in the volunteers. The optimal immunizing dose, 50 micrograms, induced levels of antitoxin (geometric mean (GM) 302 U) comparable to those found in eight adults convalescent from pertussis (GM 269 U) and greater than those found in 18-month-old children after their fourth dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (GM 20.0 U, p less than 0.001). These data indicate that NICHD-Ptxd is safe and immunogenic in adults, and they justify its evaluation in infants and children.\r"

Influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide vaccine at a wide range of doses, and challenged them with H. influenzae type b given intraperitoneally. Bacteremia occurred in 89% of protected, vaccinated pups compared with 17% of protected, unvaccinated pups (p = 0.0001). In protected, vaccinated pups the rate of bacteremia resembled that in unprotected, unvaccinated control pups and did not vary with the dose of vaccine administered. The magnitude of bacteremia and the incidence of meningitis in protected, vaccinated pups exceeded that occurring in the protected, unvaccinated control animals, but these effects diminished with the dose of vaccine. Diminution of anticapsular antibody occurred in association with the largest doses of vaccine. We conclude (1) that the administration of H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide vaccine in infant rats is associated with a diminution of passively acquired anticapsular antibody immediately after vaccination and (2) that experimental challenge with H. influenzae type b at this time produces disease resembling that in animals not passively given protection.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular recordings from the dorsal root ganglion cells of adult frogs in the presence of tetraethylammonium display action potentials with a prominent calcium-dependent plateau. These action potentials can be altered by serotonergic agents in one of two ways. The superfusion of 5-HT (0.1-1 microM) usually produces a dose-dependent reduction of the action potential duration, whereas 8-hydroxy dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (10-50 microM) produces a dose-dependent increase in duration. A series of 5-HT antagonists were tested for their ability to block either the 5-HT or the 8-OH-DPAT effect. The antagonists were chosen for their reported selectivity in distinguishing receptors of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 subtypes. The antagonists' action on 5-HT narrowing [blockade by methiothepin, spiperone and spiroxitrine, but not by ketanserin or 3-tropyl-indole-3-carboxylate (ICS 205-930)] suggests that this response is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. The widening effect produced by 8-OH-DPAT (a putative 5-HT1A agonist) was not blocked by any antagonist tested. At lower concentrations (0.1-2.5 microM) 8-OH-DPAT exhibited no agonist actions, but antagonized the 5-HT-induced narrowing. These results suggest the 5-HT receptors mediating 5-HT action potential narrowing in these cells are of the 5-HT1A subtype, but that they differ from the 5-HT1A receptors described in other tissues in which 8-OH-DPAT is an agonist or a partial agonist.\r"

The side chain of amphetamine was held in one of its two low energy conformations [transantiperiplanar (extended) and gauche (folded)]. This was accomplished by using the benzobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, benzobicylco[2.2.2]octane, or tetrahydroisoquinoline ring systems. The potencies of all of the conformationally defined analogs were reduced with IC50 values of 120 to 370 microM and the potency differences between anti- and gauche conformations were small. These results are in contrast to those obtained by us earlier for inhibition of neuronal reuptake and suggest that vesicular uptake may be more conformationally restrictive than neuronal reuptake. It is possible that: 1) the amphetamine pharmacophore must retain some conformational flexibility for vesicular uptake (hence activity for 2-aminotetralin but not for the rigid analogs); 2) there is another higher energy conformation of amphetamine not present in any of the rigid analogs evaluated that is required for optimal interaction with the vesicular uptake site; or 3) the extra steric bulk of the bridging atoms in the conformational analogs severely interferes with binding at the vesicular uptake site.\r"

DA and the selective D-2 receptor agonists quinpirole (LY-171555, the levorotatory enantiomer of LY-141865) and pergolide inhibited GLU release in a concentration-dependent way. The natural agonist was particularly effective causing 50% inhibition of GLU release at 10 nM. In contrast, the selective D-1 receptor agonist SK&F 38393 did not affect the release of GLU. The inhibitory effect of DA on the K+-evoked release of GLU was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by the selective D-2 receptor antagonist S-sulpiride, but not by the R-enantiomer. The data represent a direct demonstration that receptors sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of DA and belonging to the D-2 type are located on GLU axon terminals in the rat corpus striatum where they may modulate the release of GLU from glutamatergic afferents including the cortico-striatal pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The noradrenergic amine carrier has an important role in mediating the local release of norepinephrine (NE) during myocardial ischemia. The effects of the antidepressant or putative antidepressant drugs desipramine, 2-hydroxy desipramine, nisoxetine, (S)-oxaprotiline and (R)-oxaprotiline with respect to this release mechanism were investigated in the isolated rat heart submitted to total stop-flow ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. During the reperfusion phase a massive efflux of NE was observed, which was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the antidepressant drugs. The potency (pIC50) of the antidepressants in inhibiting the ischemia-induced NE release varied between 9.16 (desipramine) and 6.17 [(R)-oxaprotiline]. On the other hand, lidocaine (10 microM) or clonidine (1 microM) did not reduce the magnitude of the NE efflux. No attenuation in NE efflux could be detected when desipramine (0.1 microM) was present only during the reperfusion period. During repeated periods (3 x 20 min) of ischemia, desipramine (0.1 microM) reduced markedly the loss of NE. In another experiment in the isolated guinea pig heart, desipramine (0.1 microM) was also found to attenuate the ischemia-induced mobilization of NE to the same significant extent as in the isolated perfused rat heart. Chronic treatment (3 weeks) of rats with desipramine as well as acute administration of desipramine to rats (2 hr before the initiation of perfusion) caused a pronounced reduction in the ischemia-induced release of NE in the isolated perfused heart. In conclusion, these experiments strongly suggest that a major part of the ischemia-induced release of NE is mediated by the amine carrier associated with the noradrenergic nerve terminal membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Irradiation increased PHA induced IL-2 production in patients with SLE and normal controls, and reached normal levels in 10 of 16 patients with SLE. This effect was due to inactivation of CD8+ suppressor cells. When PMA was used as a costimulant, maximal enhancement of IL-2 production was observed in both groups, but values in SLE remained significantly lower than in normals. These differences were not overcome by irradiation, raising the possibility that SLE suppressor cells act upon a site proximal to protein kinase C. Our studies have confirmed that active endogenous suppression may be responsible for most of the defective PHA induced IL-2 production in SLE and that this suppression is radiosensitive.\r"

The few active NK cells responded well to IL-2 by increasing their recycling capacity. Patients with mixed connective tissue disease had a normal baseline NK cell activity that responded poorly to IL-2 at the single cell level. This apparent normalcy was found to be maintained by few NK cells with high recycling activity that could not be increased further with IL-2. Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome had very low NK activity carried out by few NK cells, with low recycling indices and poor response to IL-2. Patients with scleroderma had normal NK cell functions throughout, and patients with active dermatomyositis/polymyositis were found to have diminished NK cell function with low numbers of NK cells that reverted to normal upon disease inactivation.\r"

Pain tolerance was measured at tender point and control point sites using a pressure algometer, and responses to 6 standard psychological self-reports were obtained from 125 patients with generalized nonarticular rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis. Among patients with generalized nonarticular rheumatism, published symptom criteria for fibromyalgia did not correlate significantly with the number of tender points. Only lower generalized pressure point pain tolerance distinguished fibromyalgia from other generalized nonarticular rheumatism. Generalized nonarticular rheumatism mean scores were much higher than controls on tests measuring the tendency to report physical symptoms, including headaches and functional bowel syndrome. It is probable that patients with fibromyalgia do not differ in any important physical or psychological respect from other patients with generalized nonarticular rheumatism except for the presence of tender points. However, the presence of tender points is merely a reflection of the patient's general pressure pain sensitivity and is not indicative of any special localized pathological phenomenon. The concept of fibromyalgia as an entity separate from the rest of generalized nonarticular rheumatism may be an artifact of a physician's approach to the patient. Most patients with generalized nonarticular rheumatism demonstrate an abnormally high frequency of reporting manifold disagreeable symptoms and probably come to the attention of many medical disciplines.\r"

Preclinical studies indicate that modifications in IL-2 dose, route, and schedule can influence both immune activation and antitumor effects. This study evaluated the clinical tolerance to and immunologic modifications induced by four repetitive weekly cycles of IL-2, with two dose levels (1 X 10(6) and 3 X 10(6) U/m2 per day) of IL-2 and three different daily administration schedules [bolus, continuous, or combined (bolus and continuous)], with and without indomethacin treatment. Patients in all treatment groups experienced acceptable, non-life-threatening toxic effects and immune system stimulation characterized by rebound lymphocytosis with increased numbers of natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells and enhanced direct cytolytic function. These immune changes were significantly enhanced by the repetition of IL-2 cycles beyond the first week of therapy. At an IL-2 dose of 3 X 10(6) U/m2 per day, bolus IL-2 was less immunostimulatory than continuous-infusion IL-2. The combined regimen (with half of each daily dose given as a bolus and half as a 24-hr infusion) was as stimulatory as continuous-infusion IL-2 and also induced antitumor effects. Finally, the addition of indomethacin to this regimen did not significantly modify in vitro or in vivo immune response parameters but appeared to worsen the systemic toxic effects of renal dysfunction and capillary leakage. These results suggest that continuous or combined infusion of IL-2 at 3 X 10(6) U/m2 per day on this schedule should be considered for further testing in phase II trials or in combination with other therapeutic modalities.\r"

  ".W": "Fatal infections in severely burned patients are often preceded by a decline in the production of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and the proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage stem cells (CFU-GM), and overwhelming sepsis is often associated with leukopenia. The underlying mechanisms accounting for these granulopoietic defects are poorly understood, but the fact that postburn serum has been shown to inhibit CSF production suggests that a humoral factor or factors may play a role. Previous work has demonstrated that plasma levels of lactoferrin (LF), a known inhibitor of CSF production, are elevated following burn injury. To determine if LF is responsible for serum-mediated inhibition of CSF production, serial plasma levels of LF were measured in 18 burn patients using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). LF was elevated within 24 hours of injury and was associated with an absolute granulocytosis which rapidly declined, reaching a nadir at postburn days 3 through 5. Postburn serum, especially when collected during the first 24 hours following burn injury, inhibited in vitro CSF production by normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Pre-incubation of postburn serum with an LF antibody restored normal CSF production. These data suggest that LF may play an important role in the regulation of postburn granulopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of hypospadias in the majority of patients is unknown. We examined the hypothesis that hypospadias might be explained by androgen receptor abnormalities in the atretic spongiosal tissue commonly known as chordee. We studied 10 patients with relatively severe hypospadias but with a predominantly male phenotype and no readily ascertained explanation for the defect, including no evidence of an abnormality in testosterone biosynthesis. Eight subjects had midshaft hypospadias and 2 had a penoscrotal meatus. All 10 patients had severe chordee. Serum concentrations of testosterone, and luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones were measured before human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation and a serum testosterone level was determined 24 hours after the last dose of a 5-day human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation (3,000 units per M.2 per day). Androgen receptor content and binding affinity were assayed in fibroblasts cultured from preputial skin and chordee tissue of patients and foreskin from normal male neonates. With the endogenous ligand dihydrotestosterone the mean number (maximum binding capacity) of androgen receptors was 1,013 fmol. per mg. deoxyribonucleic acid in preputial skin and 833 fmol. per mg. deoxyribonucleic acid in chordee tissue of patients, and 627 fmol. per mg. deoxyribonucleic acid in the foreskin of controls. With the nonmetabolizable, synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) the mean maximum binding capacity was 1,004, 722 and 758 fmol. per mg. deoxyribonucleic acid, respectively. Dihydrotestosterone receptor affinity (dissociation constant) was similar in preputial skin (0.20 nM.) and chordee tissue (0.21 nM.) from patients, and foreskin (0.29 nM.) from controls. Androgen receptor binding affinity of R1881 also was similar (0.30, 0.24 and 0.21 nM., respectively). Furthermore, the 5 alpha-reductase activity of preputial skin and chordee tissue of patients with hypospadias was similar to that of foreskin from normal neonates. In conclusion, isolated hypospadias in these subjects was not associated with androgen insensitivity of the spongiosal tissues on the basis of either decreased androgen receptor binding affinity, receptor number or conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.\r"

PTFE grafts (4 mm wide and 4 to 6 cm in length) were placed to each femoral artery in a heparinized canine model, in end-to-end fashion in half of the dogs and in end-to-side fashion in the remaining dogs. Each set of graft-arterial anastomoses was then sealed with either FG or OC, determined randomly, followed by simultaneous measurement of blood loss through the graft anastomoses and needle holes. There was significantly less bleeding from anastomoses sealed with FG compared with those sealed with OC, regardless of whether the anastomoses sealed with FG compared with those sealed with OC, regardless of whether the anastomosis was constructed in end-to-end (p less than 0.03) or end-to-side (p less than 0.004) fashion; overall, the operative blood loss for grafts sealed with FG was 14 +/- 6 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) vs 99 +/- 27 ml/min for those sealed with OC (p less than 0.001). In the early postoperative period, significant groin hematomas occurred more frequently in grafts sealed with OC compared with those sealed with FG. Microscopic examination of graft-arterial specimens harvested at postoperative intervals ranging from 1 day to 3 months revealed no significant inflammatory reaction with either hemostatic agent; after 2 to 3 weeks, paired specimens appeared histologically similar despite previous treatment with either FG or OC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Through a compassionate plea program (Treatment Investigational New Drug), 4805 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who previously had experienced Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) received zidovudine (Retrovir, formerly azidothymidine). Overall survival at 44 weeks after initiation of therapy was 73% (+/- 2.1%). A positive association was found between survival and pretherapy clinical status as defined by hemoglobin level, functional ability, and stage of disease as measured by time since diagnosis of PCP. For patients with baseline hemoglobin levels of 120 g/L or greater, Karnofsky scores of 90 or greater, and PCP diagnosis within 90 days prior to initiation of therapy, 44-week survival was 88%. Adverse clinical experiences associated with zidovudine therapy were consistent with those from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Survival experience of this large and diverse cohort is consistent with, and extends data from, this clinical trial. Comparison with available natural history data suggests that zidovudine therapy is associated with increased 44-week survival of post-PCP patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Nine patients who had received ATG were evaluated subsequently for the possible development of immediate epicutaneous reactions three to 12 months after treatment; one of the nine patients developed a positive epicutaneous skin test reaction.

After reperfusion, right ventricular adenosine triphosphate concentrations fell to low levels (10 +/- 6 mmol/kg). Postoperative left and right ventricular high energy phosphate concentrations (the sum of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate levels) correlated inversely with myocardial temperatures during cardioplegia (r = -0.29, p = 0.048). Aortic root cardioplegia did not cool the right ventricle as well as it did the left ventricle. The lower preoperative high energy phosphate concentrations may have increased the susceptibility of the right ventricle to ischemic injury. Alternative methods of myocardial preservation may improve right ventricular cooling and protection.\r"

Group II was subdivided according to the percent stenosis of the coronary arteries supplying the ventricular regions: group IIa, less than 75% stenosis; group IIb, greater than or equal to 75% stenosis. Mean myocardial blood flows were 154 +/- 7, 145 +/- 5, and 98 +/- 9 ml/min/100 gm in groups I, IIa, and IIb, respectively (p less than 0.01, group IIb versus groups I and IIa).

In areas with a totally occluded left anterior descending coronary artery with collaterals, mean flow was 90 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gm. The mean myocardial blood flows were 40 +/- 7 and 100 +/- 14 ml/min/100 gm in areas with anterior Q wave and non-Q wave infarction, respectively (p less than 0.01). After cardiopulmonary bypass, the mean flow increased from 99 +/- 11 to 150 +/- 7 ml/min/100 gm in the grafted areas in group IIb (p less than 0.01), but it did not change in group I or IIa. The electrolytic hydrogen clearance method provided quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion and recovery from hypoperfusion by coronary bypass grafting. This method was especially useful in patients undergoing mammary artery grafting.\r"

Maternal cytotoxic alloantibody production and the blocking effect of maternal sera on maternal lymphocyte activation were also evaluated. There was no evidence for maternal cell-mediated reactivity to paternal antigens in normal early pregnancy or in most women who aborted, but circulating cytotoxic cells were found at miscarriage in a third of affected women. There was no correlation between the production of cytotoxic antibodies and serum blocking activity, and the success of the pregnancy. These data provide evidence that cell-mediated immune reactivity may be changed in some women who abort recurrently but show that circulating immunological blocking factors are not relevant to the success of pregnancy. Their induction by maternal immunisation with paternal leucocytes does not explain why this procedure prevents recurrent spontaneous abortions.\r"

  ".W": "The causes of stroke following coronary-artery bypass surgery are largely unknown. To determine whether carotid bruits increase the risk of these events, we compared 54 patients with postoperative stroke or transient ischemic attacks with 54 randomly selected control patients. Both groups were drawn from 5915 consecutive patients who had coronary bypass surgery at our hospital from 1970 to 1984. Carotid bruits were noted preoperatively in 13 patients with postoperative stroke and in 4 control patients. Case-control analysis showed that the presence of carotid bruits increased the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attacks by 3.9-fold (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 12.8; P less than 0.05). This increased risk remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for potentially confounding variables in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Other factors associated with a significantly increased risk (P less than 0.05) of these neurologic deficits were a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (odds ratio, 6.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 22.1), a history of congestive heart failure (odds ratio, 5.3; confidence interval, 1.6 to 17.0), mitral regurgitation (odds ratio, 4.3; confidence interval, 1.4 to 12.9), postoperative atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 3.0; confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.7), a cardiopulmonary-bypass pump time of more than two hours (odds ratio, 2.7; confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.7), and a previous myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.3; confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.1). We conclude that the presence of carotid bruits increases the risk of stroke after coronary-artery bypass surgery. However, the absolute magnitude of this risk, 2.9 percent, is small and comparable to the reported risk of stroke from carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Prominent exceptions to this rule are the T cells that are specific for foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products or for products of the minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) genes in the mouse which are present at high frequencies. Here, we report a striking overlap or cross-reactivity between the T cells specific for the protein antigen pigeon cytochrome c in association with Ek alpha Ek beta and the set of T cells specific for Mlsc products. In addition, we demonstrate that the basis for this overlap is the predominant expression of one T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene, V beta 3, by T cells that recognize Mlsc products. These results indicate the importance of specific TCR alpha beta dimers in the recognition of Mlsc products and that positive or negative selection of T cells specific for Mls self-determinants may selectively alter the repertoire of T cells available for MHC-restricted recognition of foreign antigens.\r"

One proposed mechanism is that the TCR repertoire is selected by the recognition of processed self-antigens bound to MHC molecules. Here, we examine the influence of non-MHC-encoded self-antigens on the TCR repertoire expressed in an antigen-specific immune response. Most pigeon cytochrome c-specific, Ek alpha Ek beta (Ek) Ia-restricted T cells from B10.A mice express a product of the V alpha 11 gene family in association with a V beta 3 gene-encoded protein. We therefore examined V alpha 11 and V beta 3 gene expression in cytochrome c-specific T-cell lines derived from various mouse strains with different non-MHC genetic backgrounds. T cells from several strains failed to express any V beta 3 due to tolerance induced by Mlsc-encoded self-antigens. Variable levels of V alpha 11 messenger RNA (mRNA) were expressed by antigen-specific T cells from all the strains. In one strain V beta 3 was expressed in the relative absence of V alpha 11. These results directly demonstrate that self-tolerance alters TCR gene usage in the immune response to a foreign antigen, and indicate that TCR V alpha and V beta proteins may, in part, be independently selected.\r"

  ".W": "Primary encounter with antigen stimulates specific B cells not only to differentiate into cells that produce antibody at a high rate (plasma cells), but also to give rise to populations of memory cells. These cells have many characteristics that differ from virgin B cells, including their lifespan. When re-exposed to antigen, memory cells generate secondary IgG responses that are enhanced in rate, titre and affinity. At present they are considered as small resting lymphocytes which survive for long periods in a quiescent state between each antigen encounter. However, the fact that an individual may continue to make an antibody response for many months following a single injection of antigen is often overlooked. This continued antibody production is probably due to repeated stimulation of antigen-specific B cells and raises the question of whether memory B-cell clones require antigen for their maintenance. Here we show that they do, and that following transfer, in the absence of antigen, memory B-cell populations are lost from the adoptive host after 10-12 weeks.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell repertoire found in the periphery is thought to be shaped by two developmental events in the thymus that involve the antigen receptors of T lymphocytes. First, interactions between T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules select a T-cell repertoire skewed towards recognition of antigens in the context of self-MHC molecules. In addition, T cells that react strongly to self-MHC molecules are eliminated by a process called self-tolerance. We have recently described transgenic mice expressing the alpha beta T-cell receptor from the cytotoxic T lymphocyte 2C (ref. 11). The clone 2C was derived from a BALB.B (H-2b) anti-BALB/c (H-2d) mixed lymphocyte culture and is specific for the Ld class I MHC antigen. In transgenic H-2b mice, a large fraction of T cells in the periphery expressed the 2C T-cell receptor. These T cells were predominantly CD4-CD8+ and were able to specifically lyse target cells bearing Ld. We now report that in the periphery of transgenic mice expressing Ld, functional T cells bearing the 2C T-cell receptor were deleted. This elimination of autoreactive T cells appears to take place at or before the CD4+CD8+ stage in thymocyte development. In addition, we report that in H-2s mice, a non-autoreactive target haplotype, large numbers of CD8+ T cells bearing the 2C T-cell receptor were not found, providing strong evidence for the positive selection of the 2C T-cell receptor specificity by H-2b molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The intrathymic differentiation process by which precursor cells derived from the bone marrow develop into immuno-competent T lymphocytes is poorly understood. Most thymocytes express both CD4 and CD8 accessory molecules, yet little is known about either the function of these molecules or the responsiveness of the CD4+8+ double positive thymocytes that bear them. Here, we address the possibility that CD4 engagement influences T-cell receptor (TCR) expression on developing thymocytes. We engaged CD4 molecules on murine thymocytes by in vivo injection of an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, which reduced the surface expression of CD4 on CD4+ thymocytes. More importantly, CD4 engagement also affected TCR expression on CD4+ thymocytes, but the effect on CD4+8+ double positive and CD4+8- single positive thymocytes was very different. CD4+8+ thymocytes responded to CD4 engagement by dramatically increasing surface expression of TCR, whereas CD4+8- thymocytes decreased surface expression of TCR. These results demonstrate that the effect of CD4 engagement on TCR expression is dependent upon the developmental state of the responding thymocyte, and, most interestingly, results in increased TCR expression by double positive thymocytes.\r"

  ".U": "89040197\r", 
  ".W": "CD4 and CD8 are cell-surface glycoproteins expressed on mutually exclusive subsets of peripheral T cells. T cells that express CD4 have T-cell antigen receptors that are specific for antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, whereas T cells that express CD8 have receptors specific for antigens presented by MHC class I molecules (reviewed in ref. 1). Based on this correlation and on the observation that anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies inhibit T-cell function, it has been suggested that CD4 and CD8 increase the avidity of T cells for their targets by binding to MHC class II or MHC class I molecules respectively. Also, CD4 and CD8 may become physically associated with the T-cell antigen receptor, forming a higher-affinity complex for antigen and MHC molecules, and could be involved in signal transduction. Cell-cell adhesion dependent CD4 and MHC II molecules has recently been demonstrated. To determine whether CD8 can interact with MHC class I molecules in the absence of the T-cell antigen receptor, we have developed a cell-cell binding assay that measures adhesion of human B-cell lines expressing MHC class I molecules to transfected cells expressing high levels of human CD8. In this system, CD8 and class I molecules mediate cell-cell adhesion, showing that CD8 directly binds to MHC class I molecules.\r"

This suggests that CsA interferes with the processes governing self-tolerance, either by nullifying the activity of T suppressor cells or by preventing the deletion of autoreactive T cells during ontogeny in the thymus. We report here that irradiated mice given repeated injections of CsA show striking dysfunction of the thymus. There are two different effects, the first of which is that CsA seems to block the differentiation of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into mature CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ cells expressing a high density of T-cell receptors and CD3 molecules. Second, CsA-treated mice show incomplete deletion of T cells expressing T-cell receptor molecules reactive to self H-2 I-E molecules.\r"

Using a beta-DR cDNA probe, we observed no variation of the DR4 RFLP profile in sporadic or related MS patients compared with DR4-specific pattern in controls. Using a beta-DQ cDNA probe, we identified two DQw3 patterns (DQw3.1 and DQw3.2) with similar frequency in patients and in controls. No specific RFLPs were observed in association with different disease courses. The frequency of haplotype sharing in affected members of multiplex families was not different from that expected by chance. This study shows that Sardinian MS patients carry predominantly the HLA-DR4 allele, in contrast to the DR2 prevalence reported in Caucasian populations. The lack of association with HLA haplotypes in affected members of multiplex families may indicate that genetic factors outside the HLA system play a substantial role in families with MS.\r"

One hundred ten preterm and 146 full term infants received doses of DTP at 2, 4 and 6 months after birth. Adjusted analysis of the antibody responses indicated that after three doses mean titers among preterm infants to each vaccine component were comparable to those of full term infants. Adjusted analysis of the incidence of adverse events indicated that the risk of adverse events in preterm infants was not significantly higher than that in full term infants. DTP vaccine is immunogenic and safe in preterm infants when the series is initiated at 2 months after birth, and this study supports the current recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\r"

All patients had some evidence of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in the affected extremity (swelling, color change, decreased temperature, and/or hyperhidrosis). The median duration of symptoms prior to referral and diagnosis was 5 months. All children were treated as outpatients with a transcutaneous electric nerve stimulator and home-based physical therapy. With this regimen, seven patients had complete remission within 2 months. Two other patients improved with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation therapy, and one patient had no response to transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is frequently underdiagnosed in children. Increased awareness of this syndrome is important because accurate diagnosis is crucial and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation offers a safe, simple, and effective outpatient therapy for reflex sympathetic dystrophy in children.\r"

Four structural analogs of the mature, 140 amino acid murine IL-3 molecule were synthesized in which specific cysteine residues were replaced by alanines. In a quantitative IL-3 assay, based on [3H]thymidine incorporation into factor-dependent cells, the IL-3 analog with alanines substituted for all four cysteines--i.e., [Ala17,79,80,140]IL-3--had 1/500th as much activity as the molecule synthesized according to the native sequence. The two analogs [Cys17,79,Ala80,140]IL-3 and [Cys17,140,Ala79,80]IL-3 had similarly low activity, whereas the [Cys17,80,Ala79,140]IL-3 analog had 2000-fold higher activity than these three analogs, and 3-fold higher than the molecule with the native sequence. This shows that in IL-3 a single disulfide bridge, between cysteines 17 and 80, is required for biological activity that approximates physiological levels. This disulfide probably stabilizes the tertiary structure of the protein to give a conformation that is optimal for function.\r"

Previous haplotype analysis, using 10 restriction fragment length polymorphic sites, suggested that the patient inherited two identical LDL receptor alleles. The polymerase chain reaction technique was used to selectively amplify exon 2 of the LDL receptor gene from this patient. Sequence analysis of the amplified fragment disclosed a deletion of six base pairs that removes two amino acids, aspartic acid and glycine, from the first cysteine-rich ligand binding repeat. The mutation creates a new PstI restriction site that can be used to detect the deletion. The existence of this mutant allele confirms that the epitope of IgG-C7 is located in the first cysteine-rich repeat and that this repeat is not necessary for LDL binding. The mutant gene produced a normally sized 120-kilodalton LDL receptor precursor protein that matured to the 160-kilodalton form at less than one-fourth the normal rate. Thus, deletion of two amino acids within the first cysteine-rich repeat retards receptor transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, in contrast to deletion of the entire first repeat, which has no effect on receptor maturation.\r"

The relative ratio of the two heteroplasmic molecules varies 3-fold among these three animals and documents a rapid segregation of mitochondrial genotypes in mammals. DNA sequencing shows the difference is due to a single guanine at position 364 in bovine mitochondrial DNA. A model involving unequal partitioning of the two amplified mitochondrial DNA species during the early cell divisions of the embryo can explain the appearance of such variation in heteroplasmic sibling animals. The model provides a basis for understanding the rapid DNA sequence variation observed in vertebrate mitochondrial DNA despite its high copy number and strict maternal inheritance.\r"

Our results indicate that the combined measurement of antibodies to native DNA and to ubiquitin could appreciably increase the detection of SLE cases (up to 85% in our study).

Whether T cells recognize MHC class II alloantigen by a similar mechanism or the native conformation of MHC molecules themselves has yet to be determined. The demonstration that peptide antigens bind directly and specifically to class II molecules has allowed us to examine the influence of foreign peptide binding on T-cell recognition of allogeneic MHC molecules. We report here that an immunodominant, HLA-DR1-restricted peptide of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA residues 306-320) is able to modulate the recognition of alloantigen by human DR1-specific T-cell clones. For some T-cell clones, but not all, the HA peptide inhibited allorecognition in a dose-dependent manner. However, in one instance, the proliferative response to alloantigen was enhanced in the presence of HA peptide. These results suggest that the specificities of T-cell responses to allogeneic MHC molecules are heterogeneous, which may be influenced by different peptides occupying the class II MHC combining site and by the diversity of antigen-specific receptors of T lymphocytes recognizing the same MHC/peptide complex.\r"

Using a newly developed flow cytometric analysis based on the binding of biotinylated IL-4 and phycoerythrin-streptavidin, it was observed that receptor up-regulation in a T-cell population treated with IL-4 was a feature of the majority of the T cells. Analysis of IL-4 by cross-linkage of 125I-labeled IL-4 to IL-4 receptor with disuccinimidyl suberate indicated that the IL-4-IL-4 receptor complex was the same size in the resting and up-regulated cells, implying that the same receptor species found in resting cells was up-regulated in response to IL-4.\r"

This, and other previous evidence, suggests that latent viral infection may be an atherogenic trigger. Moreover, active HSV-1 lesions manifest marked fibrin deposition in microvessels. In this report we show that very early infection of human endothelial cells with HSV-1 appears to alter surface conformation as detected by merocyanine 540 staining. Concomitantly, the efficiency of prothrombinase complex assembly increases, resulting in a 2- to 3-fold accelerated rate of thrombin generation on the cell surface. Increased thrombin generation is probably doubly procoagulant, since we also demonstrate that thrombin-induced platelet accumulation on HSV-infected endothelium (50.7 +/- 9.3%) is increased compared to uninfected endothelium (9.5 +/- 2.1%; P less than 0.002). Associated with HSV infection, prostacyclin secretion in response to thrombin is diminished by a factor of 20, probably explaining the enhanced platelet attachment. We conclude that HSV infection shifts endothelial cell properties from anticoagulant to procoagulant, both by promoting prothrombinase complex formation and function and by increasing platelet binding, well before cell disruption takes place. Virus-induced changes in the endothelial plasma membrane and diminished prostacyclin secretion are suggested as the pathways for this pathophysiologic mechanism, which may be germane to atherosclerotic thrombosis as well as HSV-mediated tissue necrosis.\r"

Lysolecithins caused slowly progressing, dose-dependent relaxation that was inhibited by hemoglobin, methylene blue, and nordihydroguiaretic acid. Indomethacin caused no inhibition of relaxation. The degree of relaxation was endothelium-dependent and appeared to be related to the activation of guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2]. Superoxide dismutase failed to influence relaxation. Lysolecithins with the longest aliphatic chain were the most potent relaxants of aortic strips. The experiments suggest a role of lysolecithins through their weak detergent action on membrane dynamics of endothelial cells, resulting in the production of cyclic GMP and the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle. Lysolecithins differ in several respects from endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is an unstable humoral substance released from endothelium and is identical to nitric oxide, itself a labile substance causing vascular relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation. Lysolecithins may represent a different type of endothelium-dependent muscle relaxant.\r"

When presynthesized HIV-1 or HTLV-I tat proteins were separately introduced into these cells in the presence of cycloheximide, we found a strong increase in the steady-state expression of the homologous viral LTR. Nuclear \"run-on\" assays verified that this tat-mediated enhancement, occurring in the absence of de novo cellular protein synthesis, was due to increased transcriptional initiation at the LTR promoter. We conclude that one aspect of transcriptional trans-activation of viral LTR by the HIV-1 and HTLV-I tat proteins does not require the production of new cellular proteins.\r"

We have shown recently in the amphibian distal nephron that aldosterone activates a Na+/H+ exchange system in the luminal cell membrane, thus leading to transepithelial H+ secretion and cytoplasmic alkalinization. Since H+ secretory fluxes were paralleled by K+ secretion, it was postulated that the hormone-induced increase of intracellular pH activates the luminally located K+ channels. In \"giant\" cells fused from individual cells of the distal nephron, we measured simultaneously cytoplasmic pH and cell membrane K+ conductance during acidification of the cell cytoplasm. The experiments show that cell membrane K+ conductance is half-maximal at an intracellular pH of 7.42 and that a positive cooperative interaction exists between K+-channel proteins and H+ (Hill coefficient = 6.5). Moreover, the cellular K+ conductance is most sensitive to cytoplasmic pH in the range modified by aldosterone. This supports the hypothesis that intracellular H+ activity, regulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger, serves as the signal to couple aldosterone-induced K+ secretory flux to H+ secretion in renal tubules.\r"

Both CD10+ CD19+ and CD10+ CD19- precursor populations proliferated in vitro to form B-cell precursor colonies under stimulation from low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (L-BCGF) or recombinant interleukin 3 but did not respond to high molecular weight B-cell growth factor (H-BCGF). The colonies derived from the CD10+ CD19- fraction showed induction of CD19 expression in 10-50% of growing cells, suggesting that CD10 expression precedes CD19 expression in B-cell ontogeny. This hypothesis was corroborated by less-differentiated marker profiles of the progeny of CD10+ CD19- B-cell precursors as compared to CD10+ CD19+ B-cell precursors in BCGF-stimulated cultures and by higher percentages of CD10+CD19- versus CD10-CD19+ B-cell precursors. CD19 crosslinking on normal fetal liver or bone marrow B-cell precursors was associated with an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, but was inhibitory for colony formation. Leukemic B-cell precursors from acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) differed from normal B-cell precursors in their in vitro proliferative responses, since (i) they responded not only to L-BCGF and rIL-3 but also to H-BCGF and (ii) their proliferation was stimulated rather than inhibited by CD19 crosslinking. A clonogenic leukemic counterpart for the CD10+CD19- normal B-cell precursor population does not exist among malignant cells from B-cell precursor ALL patients, suggesting that the CD19 receptor may be involved in leukemogenesis of human B-cell precursor ALL.\r"

  ".W": "The peptide p89-101 (Val-His-Phe-Phe-Lys-Asn-Ile-Val-Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro) of myelin basic protein is encephalitogenic in mice expressing H-2q and H-2s antigens. Six of 13 encephalitogen-specific T-cell clones were shown to express the variable beta-chain (V beta) 17a gene product (KJ23a+), whereas seven clones were KJ23a-. Both KJ23a+ and KJ23a- subpopulations were encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice when adoptively transferred. Depletion of KJ23a+ cells in vivo with the administration of the antibody KJ23a suppresses experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with KJ23a+ T-cell lines. However, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with either (i) encephalitogenic peptide p89-101, (ii) intact myelin basic protein, or (iii) KJ23a- T cells reactive to p89-101 cannot be prevented with monoclonal antibody KJ23a. These data indicate that in spite of the V beta 17a gene expression in a relatively large proportion of p89-101-specific T cells, such V beta gene use is not essential for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice. These results contrast with the predominance of V beta gene use (V beta 8.2) in T cells reactive to the encephalitogenic fragment (pR1-11) in PL/J mice. One reason for this lack of dominant use of a particular T-cell receptor V beta gene family in the autoimmune response to myelin basic protein in SJL/J mice stems from the observation that two encephalitogenic epitopes exist in p89-101. KJ23a- T cells are stimulated by the deleted peptide p89-100, whereas KJ23a+ T cells are not. Thus, in the response to an encephalitogenic fragment of myelin basic protein containing two nested epitopes, at least two distinct T-cell receptor V beta genes are expressed. These distinct T-cell subpopulations can each trigger experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These findings have implications for therapy of autoimmune disease with antibodies to the T-cell receptor gene products.\r"

Here we show by a combination of complementation assays that the mutation in J.CaM1 affects a molecule other than the antigen-binding Ti subunit, suggesting that Ti is coupled indirectly to the signal transduction apparatus through a pathway involving the CD3 complex. We also describe another mutant, J.CaM2, in which the receptor complex is completely uncoupled from inositolphospholipid hydrolysis. J.CaM2 defines an additional complementation group, suggesting that signal transduction by the antigen receptor depends on at least two molecules distinct from Ti.\r"

The genes coding for the CD3 proteins are expressed in the earliest recognizable thymocytes, preceding the rearrangement and expression of the TCR genes. The isolation, characterization, and in vitro expression of the murine CD3-epsilon gene, as reported here, represent obligatory steps toward our understanding of the complex rules that govern T-cell-specific gene expression. The CD3-epsilon gene was transcribed from a non-TATA promoter and consisted of eight exons, two of which were unusually small (18 and 15 base pairs). The transmembrane exon was found to be homologous to the transmembrane exons of the CD3-gamma and CD3-delta genes. In transient-transfection experiments, a genomic fragment comprising 4 kilobases of upstream sequence and extending into the second exon sufficient to drive the expression of a reporter gene in murine T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is presented that the leukocyte common antigen CD45 can regulate both signal transduction by lymphocyte receptor molecules and T- and B-cell proliferation in a manner dependent on specific interactions between these receptors on the cell surface. Formation of homoaggregates of CD3, CD2, or CD28 on the surface of T cells induced by crosslinking with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) results in an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). This increase in [Ca2+]i was abolished when these receptors were crosslinked to CD45 on the cell surface. In contrast, the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by formation of homoaggregates of CD4 was strongly amplified when CD4 was coupled to CD45. T-cell proliferation initiated by immobilized anti-CD3 was inhibited by anti-CD45 or anti-CD45R when immobilized on the same surface, but not when in solution. Similarly, proliferation after stimulation of the CD2 and CD28 receptors was inhibited when a CD45 mAb was crosslinked to either CD2 or CD28 mAbs, but not when a CD45-specific mAb was bound to the cell surface separately. In B cells, the increase in [Ca2+]i and resulting proliferation induced by crosslinking either the CD19 or Bgp95 receptors was inhibited by coupling these molecules to CD45. Thus, CD45 appears to modify other cellular receptors functionally when brought into close physical association with them. The homology of the CD45 conserved cytoplasmic domains with a major human placental protein tyrosine phosphatase suggests that the effects of CD45 described here result from alterations in the phosphorylation state of tyrosyl residues in membrane-associated proteins.\r"

In addition, IL-6 synergistically enhanced the stimulation of thymocyte proliferation by recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL-1) or interleukin 2 (IL-2). Mature thymocytes lacking peanut agglutinin receptor are the main target of IL-6 action. Incubation of thymocytes with IL-6 in the presence of PHA resulted in an increased expression of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Monoclonal antibody specific for the p55 chain of the murine IL-2R significantly reduced IL-6-stimulated thymocyte proliferation in the presence of the optimal concentration of PHA. However, the same monoclonal antibody failed to reduce IL-6-driven thymocyte proliferation in the presence of a suboptimal PHA concentration, suggesting that IL-6 stimulates thymocyte proliferation by way of IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent pathways. These results indicate that, in addition to its earlier demonstrated ability to promote B-cell differentiation and growth, IL-6 also acts as a growth regulator in cells of the T-lymphocyte lineage. IL-6 is emerging as an important regulatory cytokine with multiple actions on immune functions.\r"

EDRF is an important regulator of smooth muscle tone and platelet aggregation and adhesion. Histamine and acetylcholine relax the intact norepinephrine-constricted guinea pig pulmonary artery by an EDRF-dependent mechanism in a medium free of amino acids. N omega-Monomethylarginine (N-MeArg; 0.25 mM) inhibited this relaxation by 64-73%. Inhibition by N-MeArg developed rapidly and was immediately and completely reversed by excess L-arginine but not by D-arginine or by citrulline. N-MeArg did not diminish relaxation induced by nitroprusside, an NO-generating agent, indicating that N-MeArg acts on endothelium rather than on smooth muscle. These observations strongly suggest that, in the intact guinea pig pulmonary artery, EDRF originates from enzymatic action on the guanido nitrogen(s) of an endogenous pool of arginine. This is strikingly similar to the origin of reactive nitrogen intermediates in activated macrophages.\r"

A new technique for quantitative geometric correlation of such studies makes it possible to create integrated multimodality images by mapping features from one image onto an image obtained with another modality. The coordinate transformation between any pair of images is found by a semiautomatic algorithm for matching models of the patient's external surface as depicted in the two data sets. The resultant hybrid images, which combine complementary features of different studies, are often more useful for diagnosis and treatment planning than are the original single-modality images. The algorithm can also be used for spatial registration of baseline studies with follow-up images created with the same modality, which allows tracking of a lesion to detect subtle interval changes in size and shape. This technique can be applied to images acquired in routine clinical practice, since it is completely retrospective and does not necessitate special positioning or landmarking of the patient.\r"

The two enzymes were closely related as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, kinetic constants with several substrates, amino acid composition, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and reaction with antisera. In addition to having different isoelectric points, the two enzymes migrated to slightly different positions on polyacrylamide gels and differed significantly in rate of catalysis for cephalothin, imipenem, and the penem Sch 34343.

In investigations comparing the inhibitory effect of sulbactam (penicillanic acid sulfone) and cloxacillin sulfone on the cephalosporinase and on TEM-2-type penicillinase, sulbactam was found to be an effective progressive inhibitor but a poor competitive inhibitor for the cephalosporinase. The cephalosporinase and the inhibitor formed a long-lived complex with a half-life of 550 minutes. Cloxacillin sulfone could not inactivate the cephalosporinase progressively but irreversibly inactivated the penicillinase.\r"

Expression of the cloned E. cloacae 1194E ampR-ampC region was examined initially in Escherichia coli HB101. However, transformants showed only constitutive beta-lactamase expression. For study of enzyme expression in a more closely related host, the cloned E. cloacae 1194E ampR-ampC region was transformed into E. cloacae 55, a wild-type strain producing a group B (pI 7.8) enzyme. Results indicated a functional E. cloacae 1194E ampR gene that could not be transcomplemented by E. cloacae 55. A comparative analysis of ampR nucleotide and amino acid-sequence data from E. cloacae 1194E and E. cloacae MHN1 revealed related but divergent genes. Thermal induction studies of AmpC beta-lactamase also indicated a difference between E. cloacae 1194E and E. cloacae 55 in ampR-ampC interaction. Thus, it appears that, in at least some strains of Enterobacter, significant intraspecies divergence of ampR has occurred. This heterogeneity in ampR would not have been detected with beta-lactamase expression studies conducted exclusively in E. coli.\r"

The structural gene, ampC, is located adjacent to the regulatory gene, ampR, coding for a protein that can serve as an activator in the presence of an inducer. An example of an ampR mutant that is independent of an inducer has been studied. More important for the development of cefotaxime resistance in E. cloacae are mutations in the ampD gene and other proposed regulatory genes. Inactivation of the ampD gene leads to elevated beta-lactamase production. Thus, ampD negatively controls ampC expression.

In addition, beta-lactamase induction in E. cloacae bearing the previously mentioned plasmids was studied. After induction of the beta-lactamase with cefoxitin, the specific hydrolytic activity, the viable cell count, and the degradation of cefoxitin were determined. beta-Lactamase expression decreased with an increasing amount of the ampD gene product. The cefoxitin concentration decreased in proportion to the amount of enzyme, but the induction of beta-lactamase seemed not to be an important factor influencing the viable cell count of E. cloacae as long as cefoxitin concentrations exceeded the MIC. Despite different beta-lactamase concentrations, the decrease in the viable cell count was nearly identical in all experiments.\r"

  ".W": "Before 1985 at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris (2,400 beds), resistance to cefotaxime in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae involved only species producing inducible class 1 beta-lactamase. Between November 1985 and April 1987, however, 62 isolates (57 of Klebsiella pneumoniae and five of Escherichia coli) showed decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime (mean MIC, 8-16 micrograms/mL). The transferability of cefotaxime resistance in E. coli K12 was demonstrated for 15 of 16 selected isolates. By isoelectric focusing using iodometric detection with 20 mg of ceftriaxone/100 mL and determination of substrate and inhibition profiles, three beta-lactamases mediating cefotaxime resistance were identified as SHV-2 (isoelectric point [pI] 7.6), CTX-1 (pI 6.3), and \"SHV-2-type\" or SHV-3 (pI 6.98). The three beta-lactamases hydrolyzed penicillins and cephalosporins (including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) and were therefore designated \"extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases\" (EBS-Bla). The enzymes conferred to derivatives a high level of resistance to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, and cephalothin and a decreased degree of susceptibility (i.e., MICs increased by 10- to 800-fold) to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. These beta-lactamases did not affect the activity of cephamycins (cefoxitin, cefotetan, moxalactam) or imipenem. Synergy between clavulanate or sulbactam (2 micrograms/mL) and amoxicillin was greater against derivatives producing EBS-Bla than against those producing TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1; this synergy was greater with clavulanate than with sulbactam against derivatives producing SHV-2 and the SHV-2-type enzyme but was similar with clavulanate and sulbactam against those producing CTX-1. A double-disk synergy test performed with cefotaxime and Augmentin disks (placed 30 mm apart, center to center) seemed a useful and specific test for the detection of strains producing EBS-Bla.\r"

Suppression of T lymphocyte reactivity was also induced by injecting BALB/c mice intravenously with coccidioidin or a soluble extract of C. immitis cell walls. Suppression by intravenously administered antigen occurred via the activation of a splenic suppressor cell, as evidenced by suppressed T cell responses in recipients of spleen cells from antigen-injected donors.

  ".U": "89043577\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 314 immunocompromised patients with serious cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection treated with ganciclovir administered intravenously were studied. Rates of favorable clinical response among evaluatable patients were 91 (84%) of 108 for CMV retinitis, 35 (83%) of 42 for gastrointestinal CMV infection, and 26 (72%) of 36 for CMV pneumonia. Of 167 treated patients who had AIDS, improvement or stabilization of CMV disease occurred in 83% as compared with 13% of 39 untreated, historical control patients with AIDS and similar CMV disease (P less than or equal to .004). Virologic response was noted in 111 (92%) of 121 patients who had sequential cultures of blood, urine, or throat washings for CMV. In an attempt to prevent relapse of CMV disease after discontinuation of ganciclovir, maintenance treatment was evaluated in a group of 61 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis who had received an initial dosage of greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/(kg.d) for greater than or equal to 10 days. Median time to relapse of retinitis was 47 days in patients not receiving maintenance treatment as compared with 105 days in patients treated with 25-35 mg/(kg.w) (P = .0002). Adverse effects of treatment included neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (19%), central nervous system effects (18%), nausea (6%), fever (6%), rash (6%), vomiting, diarrhea, infusion site reactions, and anemia (4% each). It was concluded that ganciclovir has clinical efficacy against CMV disease, as well as an in vivo antiviral effect, and that this agent reduces morbidity of serious CMV infections in immunocompromised patients.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir was evaluated in 21 patients with life- or sight-threatening cytomegalovirus infections. Thirteen patients had normal renal function and eight patients had various degrees of renal insufficiency. Most patients received 5 mg of ganciclovir/kg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion twice daily for periods of up to 2 weeks. Quantification of ganciclovir was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. In patients with normal renal function, a biexponential decay of ganciclovir from plasma was observed, with an initial distribution half-life (t1/2) of 0.76 +/- 0.67 hour and a terminal elimination t1/2 of 3.60 +/- 1.40 hours. A large fraction of the administered dose was excreted in urine, and total clearance of ganciclovir correlated well with creatinine clearance. In patients with renal insufficiency who were receiving 5 mg of ganciclovir/kg, the terminal elimination t1/2 of ganciclovir was markedly increased (11.50 +/- 3.90 hours), as compared with values obtained in patients with normal renal function. Hemodialysis efficiently reduced levels of ganciclovir in plasma by approximately 53.0% +/- 11.5%, a finding that indicates this drug should be administered after dialysis.\r"

Sites of infection included the colon (46 patients, 67%), esophagus and stomach (15 patients, 22%), rectum (five patients, 7%), liver (two patients, 3%), and small bowel (one patient, 1.4%). Ganciclovir was given in a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours for 14 days. Maintenance therapy consisted of 6 mg/kg daily. Positive clinical responses were seen in 52 (75%) of the 69 patients, stable responses in 9 (13%), and worsening in eight (11%). The virologic response was positive in 47 patients (68%), while virologic findings did not change in three patients (4%) and could not be evaluated in 19 patients (28%). Toxicity was mainly hematologic, with moderate leukopenia (1,000-1,900 leukocytes/mm3) in seven patients and severe leukopenia (less than 1,000 leukocytes/mm3) in three patients. The median survival time was 18 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Forty-seven patients survived for 4 weeks; of these, 22 (47%) relapsed. The median time to relapse was 9 weeks. Despite the uncontrolled nature of this study, ganciclovir is probably an effective and safe agent for the treatment of gastrointestinal CMV infections. The high probability of relapse (50%) should be considered and maintenance therapy offered to most patients.\r"

The increase in MnSOD mRNA occurred rapidly and was blocked by actinomycin D, but not by cycloheximide. Induction of MnSOD mRNA was also observed with TNF-beta, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and IL-1 beta but not with other cytokines or agents tested. TNF-alpha induced MnSOD mRNA in all cell lines and normal cells examined in vitro and in various organs of mice in vivo. These effects of TNF-alpha and IL-1 on target cells may contribute to their reported protective activity against radiation as well as their ability to induce resistance to cell killing induced by the combination of TNF-alpha and cycloheximide.\r"

  ".W": "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [I(1,4,5)P3] is a second messenger generated along with diacylglycerol upon the binding of various physiological agents with their cell surface receptors. I(1,4,5)P3 mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites through a receptor-coupled mechanism, and the subsequent increased intracellular free calcium ion concentration [( Ca2+]i) activates a multitude of cellular responses. Electropermeabilized neoplastic rat liver epithelial (261B) cells were used to study Ca2+ sequestration, a process that reverses the elevated [Ca2+]i to resting levels and replenishes intracellular Ca2+ pools. Although I (1,4,5)P3-mobilized Ca2+ is readily sequestered into storage pools by the action of Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatases, Ca2+ mobilized by addition of the nonmetabolized inositol trisphosphate isomer I(2,4,5)P3 is not sequestered, suggesting that metabolism is necessary to eliminate the stimulus for Ca2+ release. Several inositol phosphate compounds were examined for their ability to lower the buffer [Ca2+] to determine if a specific I(1,4,5)P3 metabolite might be involved in stimulating Ca2+ sequestration; of these, I(1,3,4,5)P4 alone was found to induce Ca2+ sequestration, demonstrating a physiological role for this inositol trisphosphate metabolite.\r"

Of these, 129 were treated with serial sclerotherapy alone. The remaining 48 patients underwent liver transplantation after sclerotherapy; these are reported separately. Patients were classified by Child's criteria, by the severity of the initial bleeding episode as reflected by the urgency of treatment, and by the nature of the underlying liver disease. Long-term survival rates were markedly influenced by Child's classification, with 83% of the patients in class A, 45% of those in class B, and 20% of those in class C surviving beyond 36 months (p less than 0.001). Urgent treatment was associated with a poorer survival than was elective treatment (p less than 0.001). Survival was not influenced by underlying alcoholic liver disease as compared to a nonalcoholic liver disease. The majority of deaths occurred within the first 100 days after the initial treatment. Child's class B and C patients had the highest early mortality rates, particularly in an acute treatment setting. The most frequent causes of death included progressive liver failure and persistent hemorrhage. Sclerotherapy for bleeding esophageal varices may successfully control hemorrhage, but the influence of this treatment on long-term survival is limited. Hepatic reserve, indicated by Child's classification, is the major determinant of survival. Significant improvements in survival after variceal bleeding are intimately linked to improvement in liver function.\r"

  ".W": "Suppression of cellular immunity and increased susceptibility to sepsis frequently accompany thermal injury. However, a convincing association between the two has been difficult to establish in human beings. Therefore we chose to investigate the relationship of impaired cell-mediated immunity with susceptibility to sepsis in an animal model. We studied the response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production by splenocytes from mice subjected to a standard 25% scald burn and killed at intervals of 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 25 days after thermal injury. Burned mice were compared in all instances to sham-burn animals (i.e., animals that had been anesthetized and shaved but not burned). We also studied mortality after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), as a septic challenge, in burned and control animals at the same postburn intervals. We found maximal suppression (50% to 55%) of the PHA response at 10 to 14 days after injury and maximum suppression (68%) of IL-2 production at 7 days. Both of these parameters returned to normal by postinjury day 28. Mortality after CLP increased gradually from control levels after thermal injury up to a maximum of 88% on postburn day 10 and also returned to control levels after 28 days after burn. Significant correlations were found between mortality after CLP in the postburn period and suppression of the PHA response, on the one hand, and the suppression of IL-2 production, on the other (r = 0.89 and 0.91, respectively; p less than 0.05). This result implies a causal relationship between impaired cell-mediated immunity and susceptibility to sepsis after burn injury.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies by this group have demonstrated that hepatocellular integrity is important in the preservation of host cellular immune function. This study evaluated the effect of experimental hepatocellular dysfunction (EHD) on host antineoplastic defense mechanisms. In nonspecific immune studies, we examined the effect of EHD on Wistar Furth (WF) natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity; in specific immune studies, we assessed WF C3H/HeJ lymphocytic responsiveness to both T cell mitogen and unmodified syngeneic fibrosarcoma. In concurrent studies, we evaluated the effect of EHD on interleukin-2 (IL-2) synthesis, an important NK and T cell trophic factor. WF rats and C3H/HeJ mice were assigned to three groups: EHD induced by bile duct ligation, sham, and normal control (NC). At day 21 serum bilirubin, WF NK cytotoxicity to YAC-1 tumor cells, WF and C3H/HeJ lymphocytic responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and syngeneic MCA-fibrosarcoma (MCA-F), and WF T-helper IL-2 production were determined in respective groups. Serum total bilirubin was elevated in EHD rats and mice with respect to controls (p less than 0.01). Wistar Furth cytotoxicity to the YAC-1 tumor cells was depressed in EHD animals with respect to sham and NC groups at 12.5:1 (p less than 0.01), 25:1 (p less than 0.05), 50:1 (p less than 0.05), and 100:1 (p less than 0.05) effector/target cell ratios. WF T cell responsiveness to PHA was depressed in EHD with respect to controls (p less than 0.01). C3H/HeJ lymphoproliferative response to MCA-F tumor antigen was also depressed in EHD animals when compared with control groups with the addition of 12.5 X 10(3) (p less than 0.05) and 50 X 10(3) (p less than 0.05) MCA-F cells. These impairments in NK and T cell function in EHD could not be attributed to diminished IL-2 production (EHD vs sham and NC: 112,141 +/- 5232 vs 106,691 +/- 1419 and 120,759 +/- 3248 cpm, respectively). These results demonstrate that hepatocellular failure compromises NK and T cell tumoricidal function, an effect not resultant on diminished T helper IL-2 production.\r"

A significant decrease was found both in the percentage of Leu 11 positive cells and in NK cell activity as compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The decrease in NK cell activity could not be entirely compensated by an increase in effector/target cell ratios, thus suggesting not only a quantitative but also a functional defect in NK cells of the AA patients. Three of four AA patients tested showed no major increase of Ig production after PWM stimulation. All these three patients also had fewer \"functional T helper\" cells (Leu3+/Leu8-) and increased numbers of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (Leu2+) when compared to controls. No significant differences in numbers of B lymphocytes (B1+) could be found. Our findings suggest a possible linkage between quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in lymphocyte subsets in aplastic anemia.

  ".W": "With the advent of chemical dissolution and lithotripsy for the treatment of gallstones, use of imaging techniques to determine the chemical composition of gallstones has become important. In vitro CT scans were performed on gallstones removed at surgery from 70 patients. The CT appearances were as follows: dense (20%), faint (10%), isodense with saline (nonvisualized) (26%), rimmed (30%), and laminated (14%). Stones from 50 patients were subjected to chemical analysis, and the results were compared with the appearance of the stones on CT. Among stones grouped by CT appearance, a significant difference in cholesterol content was found, but calcium content did not differ significantly among most groups. The inverse correlation between CT attenuation values and cholesterol was stronger (r = -.82) than the correlation between CT attenuation values and calcium (r = .64). The results show that gallstones can be divided into those with high cholesterol content and those with low cholesterol content on the basis of their appearance on in vitro CT. The differences in the CT findings in many gallstones appear to relate more to cholesterol content than to calcium composition.\r"

In order to prevent gallbladder wall invagination and intraperitoneal bile leakage, the fundus is first secured to the abdominal wall with a removable anchoring device that is introduced through a 17-gauge needle system under sonographic and fluoroscopic control. With this technique, the gallbladder was drained in seven patients with possible empyema, and stones were extracted from the gallbladder in three patients who were poor risks for cholecystectomy. None of the patients had hypotension, bile leakage, peritonitis, or bleeding. Subhepatic cholecystostomy was done safely in 10 patients after temporarily anchoring the fundus to the abdominal wall.\r"

This column of fragments is referred to as a \"steinstrasse\" (plural, steinstrassen). We evaluated the first 1000 patients treated with ESWL at our institution to determine the frequency of steinstrasse formation, the clinical course of patients with steinstrassen, and the types of intervention, if any, required. Steinstrassen were seen in 20% of 1000 patients treated with ESWL. In 65% of the patients studied, the steinstrassen passed spontaneously. Of the remaining patients, all but 3% required treatment for ureteral obstruction. Seventy-five percent were treated urologically (ureteroscopy, ureteral catheterization), but 25% required radiologically directed intervention, either percutaneous nephrostomy or fluoroscopically monitored retrograde ureteral catheter/stent placement. Twenty-seven percent of our patients with persistent steinstrassen had silent obstruction. In view of the insidious manner in which kidney function may be jeopardized by steinstrassen, they should be managed with great circumspection. Radiologists dealing with steinstrassen should be skillful in both antegrade and retrograde methods of urinary tract intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The urographic findings of focal clubbing of the renal calices and associated parenchymal scarring usually prompt a diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis, which is frequently thought to be due to ongoing or previous vesicoureteral reflux. However, we noticed that upper tract stone disease appeared to be the condition that most often preceded or accompanied caliceal clubbing and parenchymal scarring in adults. To test the hypothesis that stones were the most common cause of this renal abnormality, we analyzed the IV urograms in 1500 consecutive patients for evidence of upper tract stone disease, vesicoureteral reflux, and caliceal clubbing and scarring. Of 39 patients with clubbing and scarring, 67% had stone disease, but only 8% had a history of reflux. Of 90 patients with stone disease, 29% had clubbing and scarring. We conclude that, in adults, upper tract stone disease may be the most important etiologic factor in the production of renal caliceal clubbing and scarring.\r"

The plain film and arthrographic findings were studied in nine patients with the fracture. Although previous publications have relied primarily on the anteroposterior projection for diagnosis, the injury was apparent only on the tunnel view in two of our cases. The arthrogram was particularly important in identifying abnormalities of the anterior cruciate ligament (nine of nine cases) and/or meniscal tears (six of nine cases). The arthrographic findings related to the lateral ligamentous damage depended on the severity of the injury and on the interval between the injury and the arthrogram. In our series, the Segond fracture was uniformly associated with detachment of the capsular portion of the lateral collateral ligament and tears of the anterior cruciate ligament. In the majority of cases, there were associated injuries of the menisci and other supporting ligaments.\r"

Patients with a dislocated prosthesis had limitation of motion, poor function, and residual pain. No increase in pain was associated with proximal subluxation of the humerus.

Nine patients had primary tumors, six had benign syringes, three had multiple sclerosis with cord involvement, three had thrombosed vascular malformations, three had probable intramedullary metastasis, and two were normal. Although all lesions were detected on noncontrast MR scans, gadolinium-DTPA was of great help in their delineation and characterization. Specifically, contrast material may be able (1) to localize tumor nidus and separate it from edema, in cases of hemangioblastomas and metastases; (2) to suggest regions of more active tumors, in cases of glioma, for surgical biopsy or removal; (3) to differentiate benign or reactive processes from neoplastic lesions, such as reactive cyst from tumor cyst or hematoma due to thrombosed malformation from tumor hemorrhage; and (4) possibly to differentiate active from inactive lesions, for example, in multiple sclerosis. Because of these advantages, gadolinium-DTPA probably will often be used routinely when intramedullary lesions are detected on noncontrast MR scans.\r"

  ".W": "During a 2-year period, 256 patients were screened for cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy with surface-coil MR images and plain films. Selected patients had follow-up examinations including CT, myelography, and CT myelography. Thirty-four of these patients underwent cervical spine surgery after MR imaging, which disclosed a total of 50 abnormalities in three major categories: herniated disks, bony canal stenoses, and intradural lesions. MR correctly predicted 88% of all surgically proved lesions compared with 81% for CT myelography, 58% for myelography, and 50% for CT. Missed herniated disks on either MR or CT myelography usually were the result of technically suboptimal studies caused by motion artifacts on MR and beam-hardening artifacts on CT myelography. Small osteophytes adjoining herniated disks sometimes were not predicted on MR, although such osteophytes invariably were seen on plain films and were palpable during standard anterior cervical diskectomy procedures. Herniated disks in the lateral root canals found in two patients appeared to be detected more readily by CT myelography than by MR. All proved lesions were detected by either screening MR images and plain films or by follow-up CT myelograms. MR replaced invasive evaluations by myelography and CT myelography in 32% of preoperative patients. We conclude that MR images, combined with plain films, offer an accurate, noninvasive test for the preoperative evaluation of cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy, while CT myelography is the preferred follow-up examination.\r"

The nerve root block procedures were performed as diagnostic tests to determine the clinical significance of equivocal herniated disk or foraminal stenosis (n = 33) and before nerve root ablations (n = 19). To evaluate the clinical significance of these nerve root blocks, we performed 52 procedures at the vertebral level where a herniated disk or foraminal stenosis had been identified on CT or MR images. In 51 of 52 cases, the procedures were successful in anesthetizing the intended nerve root, which allowed us to determine whether that particular nerve root was the source of pain. By relieving or not relieving pain, the results of the diagnostic nerve root blocks helped determine whether a protrusion or foraminal stenosis was clinically significant. The nerve root ablations were done exclusively for treatment of pain in patients with malignant disease. Significant relief of pain was obtained in 17 (63%) of 27 patients. The thoracic nerve ablations were the most successful (9/10 or 90%) because the correct thoracic nerve innervation to the offending lesion could be identified. The lumbosacral nerve ablation procedures were the least successful (6/14 or 43%) because the innervation of the pelvic neoplasms was complex, arising from multiple lumbosacral nerves that often were bilateral. Equivocal foraminal stenosis and disk protrusion are common findings on CT and MR imaging, and CT-guided nerve block procedures can help determine which of these findings are clinically significant. CT-guided nerve root ablations have limited efficacy but can help control pain in patients with a malignant disease, especially when the pain is in the distribution of a thoracic nerve dermatome.\r"

CT scanning of the chest adds important information to that obtained from chest radiographs. Gallium-67 scintigraphy has also been used to provide additional information on sites of active tumor. To determine the usefulness of 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy in planning the portals for radiation therapy, we analyzed the radiation treatment plans in 26 consecutive patients with Hodgkin disease; in all 26 patients, the disease had been staged by chest radiographs, chest CT scans, and gallium-67 images. Gallium-67 imaging alone provided unique information that affected the treatment plans in three patients (12%). The combined results of gallium-67 imaging and CT scans influenced the planning of radiation therapy in eight patients (31%). Gallium-67 imaging was found to be an important adjunctive study for optimal planning of radiation therapy in patients with Hodgkin disease.\r"

All cutaneous and mucosal lesions were thallium avid. Two of the six patients with thallium-avid nodes underwent nodal biopsy. Both biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma developed later in one of these patients, showing the efficacy of thallium scintigraphy for the early detection of extracutaneous lesions. These preliminary results show thallium avidity in Kaposi sarcoma involving the skin and various extracutaneous sites (lymph nodes, lung, mucosa, and vagina). Thallium scintigraphy is a potentially useful procedure for detecting extracutaneous Kaposi sarcoma in AIDS patients.\r"

So that the validity of this endoscopic sign could be assessed, 136 patients with portal hypertension, 25 chronic alcoholics without portal hypertension, and 366 controls were carefully endoscoped. Mosaic pattern was significantly (p less than 0.01) more common in portal hypertension patients (7.4%) than in controls (1.4%). It was not seen in chronic alcoholics. The incidence of mosaic pattern was 10.9% in cirrhotics, 2.9% in noncirrhotic portal fibrosis, and 5.4% in extrahepatic portal obstruction patients; the differences were not significant. Mosaic pattern was significantly (p less than 0.01) more often seen in postsclerotherapy (13.8%) than in presclerotherapy patients (2.6%). Bleeding from nonvariceal causes was uncommon, and was seen in only one patient (0.8%) showing mosaic pattern. Endoscopic gastric biopsies from areas showing mosaic pattern did not reveal any vascular abnormalities. In conclusion, gastric mucosal lesions are not very common in Indian patients with portal hypertension. In our experience, \"mosaic pattern\" is not a useful diagnostic feature in portal hypertension patients.\r"

  ".U": "89047317\r", 
  ".W": "Endoscopic sclerotherapy is an effective method for treating bleeding esophageal varices. However, a number of complications may limit its usefulness. A newly developed method for treating bleeding varices, endoscopic variceal ligation, that uses small rubber bands to occlude and eradicate the varices, may cause less damage to the esophagus. Twenty-eight patients (seven with no prior treatment, eight undergoing sclerotherapy, and 12 undergoing variceal ligation) were evaluated with a symptom questionnaire and esophageal manometry. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressures in the three groups did not differ. The percent LES relaxation was significantly (p = 0.04) less in the sclerotherapy group than in the untreated group. Contraction waves in the esophageal body were not different in amplitude, duration, and propagation speed in the three groups. There was no increase in the amount of heartburn after either form of treatment. Eight of the nine sclerotherapy patients had a stricture after treatment that required dilatation, whereas none of the ligation patients had strictures. We conclude from this that early in the course of sclerotherapy, stricture formation is common, but any long-lasting adverse effect on esophageal function is minimal. We also conclude variceal ligation therapy causes less esophageal dysfunction and has fewer local complications. Thus, endoscopic variceal ligation may be a safer and more easily tolerated alternative to endoscopic sclerotherapy.\r"

Three of the five had undergone prior esophageal dilation. Our patients received an average of 89 ml of 1.5% sodium tetradecyl in 7.6 sessions, compared with 51 ml in three sessions in an earlier group of EVS-induced strictures without food impaction. Esophageal manometric abnormalities were seen in three of four patients studied, two with markedly impaired peristaltic activity. All patients had successful treatment of both esophageal stricture and bleeding varices. Further sclerotherapy continued in four of five patients without additional problems.

  ".W": "The molecular nature of three different types of X-linked color-vision defects, protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and protanopia, in a large 3-generation family was determined. In the protanomalous and protanopic males the normal red pigment gene was replaced by a 5' red-3' green fusion gene. The protanomalous male had more red pigment DNA in his fusion gene than did the more severely affected protanopic individual. The deuteranomalous individual had four green pigment genes and one 5' green-3' red fusion gene. These results extend those of Nathans et al., who proposed that most red-green color-vision defects arise as a result of unequal crossing-over between the red and green pigment genes. The various data suggest that differences in severity of color-vision defects associated with fusion genes are caused by differences in crossover sites between the red and green pigment genes. Currently used molecular methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to define these fusion points accurately, and the specific color-vision defect within the deutan or protan class cannot be predicted. The DNA patterns for color-vision genes of female heterozygotes have not previously been described. Patterns of heterozygotes may not be distinguishable from those of normals. However, a definite assignment of the various color pigment gene arrays could be carried out by family study. Two compound heterozygotes for color-vision defects who tested as normal by anomaloscopy were found to carry abnormal fusion genes. In addition, a normal red pigment gene was present on one chromosome and at least one normal green pigment gene was present on the other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89047496\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monocyte factor, plays a central role in the regulation of the immune response; recent data have suggested that IL-1 is the same molecule as hemopoietin-1, a growth factor acting on the multipotent hematopoietic stem cell. IL-1 affects hematopoiesis (1) in vitro, by inducing the release of colony-stimulating factors and regulating early hematopoietic progenitor cells, and (2) in vivo, by stimulating stem cell recovery in irradiated or chemotherapy-treated mice. Several lines of evidence suggest that aplastic anemia may be mediated by cells of the immune system. We address the issue of abnormal IL-1 production in severe aplastic anemia and attempt to correlate normalization of the levels with response to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied IL-1 production by monocytes from 21 patients with aplastic anemia using a bioassay for IL-1 activity. Fifteen patients were evaluated before ATG therapy. Eight patients were studied before and three months after ATG. In addition, five patients were evaluated only after ATG treatment. One patient did not respond to ATG but did respond to intravenous acyclovir, and was studied before and after acyclovir therapy. Twenty patients with other hematologic disorders requiring transfusions and 30 normal healthy volunteers were also assessed. RESULTS: IL-1 production was markedly decreased in 75 percent of patients with aplastic anemia when compared with that in normal control subjects (p less than 0.005). Hematologic recovery correlated with normalization of IL-1 production in all but two cases (p less than 0.04). CONCLUSION: These observations represent the first evidence of monocyte dysfunction and deficient hematopoietic growth factor production in aplastic anemia. Decreased IL-1 production may have a pathologic role in some cases of aplastic anemia.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactivity for L26, a highly effective pan B cell marker that can be detected in paraffin sections, was evaluated in 72 cases of Hodgkin's disease of various histologic types. In all cases of nodular lymphocyte predominance type of Hodgkin's disease, L & H variants of Reed-Sternberg cells uniformly exhibited strong immunoreactivity for L26. Other variants of Reed-Sternberg cells, eg, lacunar, mononuclear, and diagnostic forms, present in nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte depletion types of Hodgkin's disease, infrequently expressed L26 reactivity. In 55 of 63 cases (87%) of these combined types, less than 5% of Reed-Sternberg cells or variants were L26 positive. In the remaining cases, a larger proportion of these cells expressed L26. Topographic patterns of immunoreactivity for small lymphocytes in these different types of Hodgkin's disease also varied. In nodular lymphocyte predominance type, L26 positive lymphocytes (presumptive B cells) were mainly localized to nodular areas of the proliferation. In other types of Hodgkin's disease, L26 positive cells occurred in small or large aggregates and generally represented a minor proportion of the population of lymphoid cells. These studies further support a B cell derivation for L & H variants of Reed-Sternberg cells and provide additional evidence that nodular lymphocyte predominance type Hodgkin's disease may represent a distinct entity, possibly an unusual low grade B cell lymphoma. These data also suggest that some Reed-Sternberg cells and variants present in other histologic types of Hodgkin's disease may be of B cell derivation, and precludes the use of L26 as a diagnostic discriminant in cases in which the distinction between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is unclear.\r"

Adjusted for age and education, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3 to 4 mmHg higher in Blacks. Hypertension was more prevalent in Blacks than Whites (44 per cent vs 28 per cent); serum total cholesterol was approximately 0.4 mmol/l lower in Black than White men and 0.08 mmol/l lower in Black than White women. Among men, more Blacks than Whites were current cigarette smokers (44 per cent vs 30 per cent); however, White smokers smoked more cigarettes per day (26 vs 17). Similar differences were noted for women, although the prevalence and quantity of cigarette consumption was less than men. The excess prevalence of these CHD risk factors in Blacks, especially among women, may explain their elevated CHD and stroke mortality rates in the Twin Cities.\r"

Transbronchial biopsy specimens showed chronic, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (11 of 23) and no pathologic abnormality (12 of 23). Six patients have developed P. carinii pneumonia during 2 to 18 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients without pulmonary symptoms did not have detectable Pneumocystis organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or transbronchial biopsy specimens; but 11 of 23 had evidence of chronic, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Pneumocystis organisms in a pulmonary specimen from a symptomatic patient probably indicate the cause of the pulmonary dysfunction even if only a few are detected.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 601 clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae isolated in six different regions of Sweden were tested for chloramphenicol susceptibility by using agar dilution MIC determinations and disk diffusion tests. For seven strains MICs were 4 micrograms/ml or higher, and for one strain the MIC was 2 micrograms/ml. All eight strains produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. For the remaining 593 strains, MICs were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and the MICs for 50% and 90% of the strains were both 0.5 microgram/ml. Disk diffusion tests carried out by using revised interpretive criteria introduced in 1984 by the Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics correctly identified the 593 strains as susceptible and the 8 strains as resistant. Quality assessments were performed in 29 clinical microbiology laboratories. The revised criteria for chloramphenicol disk diffusion testing gave rise to false resistance results in some laboratories. The interpretive accuracy improved when the interlaboratory variation was compensated for by using adjusted breakpoints. Such revision was possible through peak correction, single-strain regression analysis, and standard curve regression analysis. Peak-corrected breakpoints improved the accuracy from an overall incidence of false-resistant isolates of 4.4% to 2.3%. Single-strain regression analysis and standard curve regression analysis provided laboratory- and species-specific breakpoints which reduced false resistance rates of 0.14% and 0%, respectively.\r"

Twenty-four hours after inhaled or intravenous therapy, the mean (+/- standard deviation) concentrations of pentamidine in serial bronchoalveolar specimen fluid ranged from 28.6 +/- 10 to 177.5 +/- 28 ng/ml and 6.05 +/- 2.29 to 21.4 +/- 15.7 ng/ml, respectively. Pentamidine concentrations in brochoalveolar fluid were generally higher after 2 weeks than after day 1 of therapy; however, the differences were not statistically different (P greater than 0.05). The pulmonary half-life after inhaled therapy is long; pentamidine was detectable in bronchoalveolar fluid at 33 (one patient), 69 (one patient), and 115 (one patient) days following the completion of 2 weeks of therapy. Systemic absorption of pentamidine was minimal; the mean (+/- standard deviation) plasma concentration at the completion of inhalation was 13.84 +/- 11.8 ng/ml, or 5% of the mean peak plasma concentration achieved after intravenous administration. Accumulation in the plasma did not occur with repeated inhalation as has been described with multiple intravenous dosing. Cumulative urinary excretion 24 h after the first dose was 5% of that observed with intravenous administration. These data may have importance in designing dosage regimens for the further investigation of inhaled pentamidine for treatment or prophylaxis of P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

Uptake was not enhanced by infection with thymidine kinase-negative HSV-1 and HSV-2 mutants, however. In HSV-1-infected cells, 9.7% of BV-araU was phosphorylated to BV-araU triphosphate, but only 1.1% was phosphorylated in HSV-2-infected cells. The antiviral effect, uptake, and turnover of BV-araU were inhibited significantly by thymidine (dThd), moderately by deoxyuridine, and not at all by deoxycytidine. On the other hand, the antiviral activity of acyclovir (ACV) was inhibited only by dThd. The effect of BV-araU was influenced by dThd and dThd phosphates (mono-, di-, and triphosphates), and the effect of ACV was influenced only by dThd, which competitively inhibited the phosphorylation of ACV to ACV monophosphate. The combination of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR)-BV-araU or FUdR-ACV had a synergistic effect on HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication. The effect of FUdR on the turnover of BV-araU in HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected cells was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. In HSV-1-infected cells, 86% of the BV-araU was phosphorylated to BV-araU triphosphate, but no effect was observed in HSV-2-infected cells, in which 98% of the BV-araU remained as BV-araU monophosphate.\r"

  ".W": "A new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (PADAC) (50 microM), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. On the PADAC plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) CFU per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees C, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of PADAC by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. The zone diameter increased with incubation time. Examination with Enterobacter cloacae GN7471 revealed that beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the PADAC hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. At 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. The addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the PADAC plates inoculated with type IIIa, Va, Vb, PSE-1, and Ic beta-lactamase producers. When the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus vulgaris. Thus, the use of the inhibitor made it possible to detect penicillinase or type Ic cephalosporinase producers. These results proved that the PADAC plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.\r"

In HEL cells, the compounds showed antiviral activities against both strains of HSV-1, but in Vero cells, the antiviral activities of the compounds were reduced in proportion to their antiviral indexes (the 50% inhibitory dose [ID50] for cell growth divided by the 50% plaque reduction dose for virus). The ratio of the ID50 in Vero cells to the ID50 in HEL cells was larger in VR-3-infected cells than in WT-34-infected cells. The following results were obtained. (i) Thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21) activity in the VR-3- or WT-34-infected Vero cells was about half that in VR-3- or WT-34-infected HEL cells. Induction of viral TK was especially low in the VR-3-infected Vero cells. (ii) The ID50 of the plaque reduction assay in hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine medium revealed that the activity of cellular thymidylate synthetase (EC 2.1.1.45) was important in viral replication in VR-3-infected Vero cells. (iii) The VR-3-infected cells required larger thymidine and thymidine phosphate pools for viral replication than the WT-34-infected cells did, although uptake of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-E-5-(2-bromovinyl) uracil into infected cells was equal for both strains. (iv) In the VR-3-infected Vero cells, the quantity of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-E-5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil triphosphate was smaller than that in VR-3-infected HEL cells and WT-34-infected Vero and HEL cells.\r"

Tomisawa, A. Fujii, and T. Takita, J. Antibiot. 39:1623-1625, 1986). In this study, we evaluated the antiherpesvirus activity of oxetanocin A and its derivatives and found that 9-(2-deoxy-2-hydroxymethyl-beta-D-erythro-oxetanosyl)guanine (OXT-G) was very potent and selective in inhibiting the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in vitro. The median effective concentration for HCMV strain AD169 was 1.0 microgram/ml, and that for herpes simplex virus type 2 strain 186 was 3.5 micrograms/ml. The selectivity index, based on the ratio of the median inhibitory concentration for cell growth of human diploid fibroblasts to the median effective concentration for HCMV plaque formation, was more than 300. The synthesis of HCMV-induced late polypeptides such as the 150,000-molecular-weight capsid and the 68,000-molecular-weight major matrix proteins was strongly suppressed when OXT-G (5 micrograms/ml) was added to the cultures at the beginning of infection. At this concentration of OXT-G, the amount of HCMV DNA detected in the drug-treated infected cells was less than 1/10 of that detected in the infected control cells. The results suggest that the mode of action of OXT-G is inhibition of viral replication by impairing the viral DNA synthesis.\r"

Of 44 patients evaluated, 18 were eligible for the study. Of these 18 patients, the conditions of 7 of them worsened or failed to improve during treatment with dapsone and they were considered treatment failures. These patients were changed to standard therapy after 4 to 8 days of dapsone therapy. The remaining 11 patients (61%) improved within 3 to 10 days after dapsone therapy was started. Side effects of dapsone therapy were noted in 6 of 11 patients (of these 11 patients, 5 had a rash, 1 had a rash and abnormal liver enzymes, and 1 had abnormal liver enzymes), but in none of the patients were these side effects severe enough to require the cessation of medication. Based on comparison with historical controls, oral dapsone therapy alone appeared to be less effective than standard therapy or the combination of dapsone plus trimethoprim for P. carinii pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "This study concerns the in vitro interaction with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) of amodiaquine, chloroquine, and mefloquine, three antimalarial drugs currently in use for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. It was found that mefloquine (100 and 50 micrograms/ml) significantly altered PMN viability while the other two drugs did not. Neutrophil chemotaxis was impaired by chloroquine (100 micrograms/ml) and mefloquine (greater than 10 micrograms/ml) but not by amodiaquine. Phagocytosis was decreased by about 50% in the presence of chloroquine (100 micrograms/ml) or mefloquine (10 micrograms/ml). The three antimalarial drugs altered neutrophil oxidative metabolism as assessed by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. The strongest effect was observed with mefloquine, which abolished almost completely the neutrophil burst at concentrations of greater than 10 micrograms/ml whatever the stimulus used. This effect was not reversed by washing. Chloroquine and amodiaquine also impaired this PMN response by approximately 80 and 50%, respectively, but only at the highest concentration used (100 micrograms/ml). In the case of amodiaquine, the neutrophil response was restored by washing, except for stimulation with opsonized particles. After washing, the depressive effect of chloroquine was reversed completely in the case of phorbol myristate acetate stimulation and partly in the case of opsonized particle stimulation, but the formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced response was not restored. These data show that although they are structurally related, amodiaquine and chloroquine exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively different depressive effects on PMN function and probably interfere at different points of cell activation, although the precise mechanisms are as yet unresolved.\r"

The 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as DNA probes in hybridization studies. Southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal DNA from Cmr strains of C. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. Hybridization of the gene probes against Cmr strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella edwardsii, Escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.\r"

P-536 showed a wide spectrum of action and was active against HSV-1, adenovirus type 5, vaccinia virus, poliovirus type 1, encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, and measles virus, irrespective of whether these viruses have lipidic envelopes or not. P-536 clearly inhibited protein glycosylation if added at the time when late viral proteins were being synthesized. Moreover, it also interfered with the synthesis of nucleic acids and the phosphorylation of nucleosides. If P-536 was present from the beginning of infection, HSV-1 replication was blocked at an early step and the infected cells continued to synthesize cellular proteins for long periods.\r"

Two patients developed an erythrodermic exacerbation during therapy while the third patient experienced a localized flare. Topical treatment was effective in inducing remission in all three patients. Histologic analysis of serial skin biopsy specimens revealed psoriasiform changes in involved skin as well as epidermal spongiosis and a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate.

Regeneration of an intact neoendothelium occurs, but the functional properties of this surface have not been clarified. In this study, the functional integrity of the neoendothelium of veins grafted into the carotid artery of the rabbit was assessed through the use of acetylcholine and histamine to stimulate the production of the important endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Control veins, precontracted with norepinephrine [10(-5) M], relaxed after exposure to acetylcholine [( 10(-7) M], 42.4% +/- 6.4%, p = 0.008) and histamine [( 10(-6) M], 30.6% +/- 4.3%, p = 0.03). This relaxation response was abolished after mechanical removal of the endothelium. By contrast, neither acetylcholine nor histamine caused an endothelium-dependent relaxation in the vein grafts, even though scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of a morphologically intact endothelium. However, addition of stabilized EDRF purified from cultured endothelial cells induced relaxation of the vein grafts (35.8% +/- 3.6%, p = 0.002). These data indicate that vein graft endothelium is unable to produce EDRF in response to exposure to acetylcholine or histamine. The inability to produce this potent smooth muscle cell relaxing factor and anti-aggregatory substance may be a predisposition to vein graft failure.\r"

Moreover, its bland appearance contrasted with the major histopathologic changes usually described in lymph node biopsy specimens from patients with AIDS-related complex. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated, respectively, an excess of cytotoxic-suppressor lymphocytes with a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio in the germinal centers and viral particles of the human immunodeficiency virus.

Auras were more likely to be present in patients with temporal hypometabolism alone, but an initial motionless stare did not distinguish this group. However, other metabolic patterns did not predict specific ictal clinical features. Vocalizations (formed or unformed) were not more closely associated with frontal involvement.

We have used pathway analysis to evaluate computed tomography, glucose metabolic, and language data from 47 aphasic patients to answer this question. For fluency (from the Western Aphasia Battery), subcortical structural damage had direct and indirect (through frontal lobe) effects on the behavior. For a comprehension task (sequential commands), subcortical damage had no direct effect and only a slight indirect effect through the temporal lobe. Thus, both direct and indirect effects of subcortical damage can be demonstrated for specific behavioral measures.\r"

We have observed this response in additional disorders, including anomalies of the optic nerve development, congenital nystagmus, and a variety of diseases affecting the retina. Notably, four of our patients with strabismus and amblyopia, but without apparent retinal or optic nerve disease, have also demonstrated this paradoxic pupil response.

Serum levels of IL-2R correlated strongly with clinical and laboratory indicators of disease activity in patients with lupus and in those with rheumatoid arthritis. This relationship was confirmed by sequential determinations in individual patients. Serum IL-2R values correlated with disease activity better than did the Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Polymorphic patterns were detected with probes for all 3 TcR chains, but there was no significant difference in the distribution of the restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern among the patients, the relatives, and the controls. Furthermore, in the families with at least 2 individuals with the disease, each of the 3 TcR chain genes did not cosegregate with the disease.

These observations suggest that propofol-suxamethonium sequence may be followed by severe bradycardia in patients who have not received atropine. The bradycardia may be prevented by premedication with atropine. In contrast to thiopentone, propofol apparently lacks central vagolytic activity and may exert a central vagotonic effect which can exaggerate the muscarinic effects of suxamethonium.\r"

The main causes of blindness were senile cataract (55%), corneal scarring due to trachoma (10%), uncorrected aphakia (9%), and open-angle glaucoma (6%). There were 14 aphakic blind persons who did not have aphakia glasses (43% of all persons operated on for cataract). Women had a significantly higher prevalence of blindness than men. After the age of 60 years the prevalence of blindness increased sharply. Women were 1.6 times less likely to have undergone cataract surgery than men. The two most effective steps to reduce the prevalence of blindness in the Elim district further are to provide aphakia glasses to all aphakic patients and to improve the accessibility of the Eye Department's surgical services.\r"

To assess its potential for studying patients with diseases of the basal ganglia, a study of 15 normal volunteers and 32 patients with known or suspected basal ganglia disease have been investigated. Sixteen patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease showed no abnormality of the basal ganglia and varying degrees of cerebral underperfusion consistent with their intellectual status. Eight patients with Huntington's chorea showed a characteristic pattern of reduced or absent caudate nucleus uptake. Patients with diseases affecting the basal ganglia, such as Fahr's disease, Wilson's disease and hemibalismus had varying degrees of basal ganglia underperfusion as demonstrated by an HMPAO scan. We believe that this new radiopharmaceutical for the demonstration of cerebral blood flow shows significant potential for the diagnosis and management of patients with basal ganglia disease.\r"

  ".U": "89052039\r", 
  ".W": "Collagen type I is a major component of atherosclerotic vessel wall that is exposed on deep vessel injury, such as in balloon angioplasty or plaque rupture. Collagen type I from pig Achilles tendon was mounted in a tubular perfusion chamber placed within an extracorporeal circuit (carotid artery to jugular vein). The material was exposed to blood from normal pigs (n = 13), severe homozygous von Willebrand factor (vWF)-deficient pigs (vWF less than 3%) (n = 6), and heterozygous vWF-deficient pigs (vWF = 24%) (n = 2). Thrombus formation was measured by autologous 111In-platelet labeling and by ultrastructural morphology. Heparinized and native blood from these pigs was perfused over the substrate for 3 and 5 minutes at local shear rates from 212 to 3,380/sec. On collagen type I exposed to nonanticoagulated blood, for all exposure times studied, thrombus formation in the absence of vWF was significantly reduced at high shear rate typical of stenotic areas but not at low shear rate typical of unobstructed medium-size arteries. A similar inhibition in thrombus formation due to vWF deficiency was observed in both heparinized and native blood; however, thrombus formation was significantly more reduced (p less than 0.05) in the presence of heparin, presumably due to the lack of stability of the accumulated platelets in the absence of fibrin formation. Intermediate levels of vWF, as in heterozygous von Willebrand's disease (vWD), support platelet deposition to extents not significantly different from normal conditions. Therefore, on collagen type I, both the activation of blood coagulation proteins and the presence of vWF contribute significantly to the platelet-platelet interactions necessary for thrombus formation. The effect of vWF occurs primarily at high shear conditions typical intravascularly of flow at the apex of advanced stenotic lesions; thus, these findings may suggest that the absence of vWF may be protective against the development of acute thrombosis in these regions.\r"

  ".W": "Osteocalcin (a vitamin K-dependent, bone-specific protein) is widely accepted as a marker of osteoblastic activity. The present study was conducted to determine if a vitamin K deficiency would affect fracture healing by virtue of an alteration in osteocalcin metabolism. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups. The control group was fed a diet that was lacking in, but offered water replete with vitamin K. The experimental group was fed a vitamin K-deficient diet and was offered water that was lacking in vitamin K. After two weeks, vitamin K deficiency was established in the experimental group as shown by decreased urinary excretion of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and an elevation of serum prothrombin times to between two to two and one-half times the control values. At this time, a standard, closed femoral fracture was produced. Six weeks later, the animals were killed. The bones were biomechanically tested in torsion. Subsequent to mechanical testing, the calluses were retrieved, and the osteocalcin content and the degree of gamma carboxylation of the osteocalcin in the calluses were measured. The results show that despite significant alterations in the gamma carboxylation of osteocalcin and elevation of prothrombin times to two to two and one-half times the control values, there were no differences in the mechanical properties of the calluses. Furthermore, there were no differences in the content or gamma carboxylation of osteocalcin in these calluses. Apparently, in vitamin K deficiency, fracture callus achieves normal mechanical properties and may have a mechanism for the gamma carboxylation of glutamic acids in osteocalcin despite a substantial depression of this activity in the rest of the body.\r"

Adult mice were implanted with doses of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg of BMP. Several local injections of 10, 100, and 1000 units of a recombinant IL-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) were administered during the morphogenetic phase of development, starting a day before operation until one week postoperation. While IL-1 acts principally on cell proliferation, BMP primarily shows cell differentiation in the form of HO. BMP-induced HO is quantitated by computer X-ray image scanning, bone ash weight, alkaline phosphatase activity, and histological methods. The area of human BMP-induced HO was completely abolished by injections of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IL-1 antibody. Monoclonal antibody did not cross-react with the same efficiency as polyclonal with bovine BMP. Polyclonal anti-IL-1 antibody totally neutralizes bovine BMP activity. IL-1-enhanced BMP induced HO and increased the volume of new bone in a statistically significant increment.\r"

In 122 subjects (31 AIDS and 91 HIV-infected non-AIDS patients) without evidence of lung tumor or infection (group B), lymphocytic alveolitis was seen in 72 percent of cases. In 61 of 88 (69 percent) group B lymphocytic patients, we observed respiratory symptoms or diffuse interstitial opacities; however, we also observed such alveolitis in 27 of 46 (59 percent) group B patients free of respiratory symptoms and abnormality of chest x-ray film. This alveolitis was seen not only in AIDS or ARC patients but also at earlier stages of HIV infection. T-lymphocyte analysis showed a large majority (40 to 93 percent) of CD8 positive lymphocytes in the 37 patients tested. A dual fluorescence analysis revealed, in 18 subjects, that those cells were phenotypically cytotoxic (CD8 + D44 +). These findings suggest that, regardless of HIV-infection stages and of opportunistic lung infections, a CD8-positive T-lymphocyte alveolitis may be present in HIV-infected patients and could be responsible for cough, dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, and abnormalities of pulmonary function tests.\r"

Eleven of 141 patient sera tested (7.8%) immunoprecipitated labeled IGF-I receptor. Immunoprecipitation was comparable with sera and IgG prepared from these sera. Seven of the 11 sera (3 of 31 with rheumatic disorders, 3 of 48 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 1 of 52 with insulin-dependent diabetes) failed to inhibit IGF-I binding to human placental membranes and thus contained non-binding-inhibitory IGF-I-receptor antibodies. Their pathophysiological function remained uncertain. The remaining 4 sera (2 of 3 with type B severe insulin resistance, 1 of 7 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO), and 1 of 31 with rheumatic disorders) inhibited IGF-I binding. Plasma IGF-I concentrations were elevated (663 and 802 ng/ml, respectively) in 2 patients (1 with PCO and another with systemic lupus erythematosus) with binding-inhibitory IGF-I-receptor antibodies, suggesting IGF-I resistance that was probably mediated by the IGF-I-receptor antibodies. In conclusion, we identified two species of human IGF-I-receptor antibodies. Sera from 7 of 141 patients tested contained IgG autoantibodies that bound to the IGF-I receptor at a locus different from the IGF-I binding site and did not inhibit IGF-I binding. Sera from 4 of 141 patients contained antibodies that bound to the IGF-I receptor at or near the IGF-I binding site, inhibited IGF-I binding, and probably caused IGF-I resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Blastogenesis of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction has been shown to be decreased in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are not known. To investigate further the abnormal autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction in primary biliary cirrhosis, we measured the activation of autoreactive helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes concurrently with blastogenesis in 35 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and 18 healthy controls. Blastogenesis was diminished in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from primary biliary cirrhosis patients compared to the control subjects (25,273 +/- 20,259 dpm vs. 36,004 +/- 14,951 dpm, p less than 0.02), but cultures from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis contained significantly increased percentages of activated helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes: 20.6 +/- 7.9 vs. 15.5 +/- 5.3%, p less than 0.008, and 9.8 +/- 7.8 vs. 5.4 +/- 3.0%, p less than 0.02, respectively. These findings were not related to the histologic stage of liver disease or to the serum bilirubin concentration and were not associated with abnormalities of lymphocyte subsets in fresh peripheral blood specimens. We conclude that the percentage of autoreactive T lymphocytes in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from peripheral blood is increased in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and diminished blastogenesis in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures is not due to the loss of autoreactive T lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Diminished blastogenesis reflects a diminished proliferative response of activated, autoreactive T lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis. Possible mechanisms that may account for the paradoxical findings of decreased blastogenesis and increased activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis are discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A sample of 26 spouses were interviewed in a cardiology clinic 4 to 10 weeks after their mate's bypass surgery. Associations between demographic characteristics and the level of adjustment were determined by chi-square (adjusted for continuity) analysis. Nineteen spouses reported a high level of vigilance, with 13 reporting that this was a change since their mate's surgery. Ten spouses reported their economic level to be highly inadequate, and all of those stated that their economic situation had changed since surgery. A small number of subjects rated their mate as being dependent on them, and they had feelings of anxiety, fear, and depression. All of those subjects described this as a change since surgery. The majority of subjects had a low level of marital friction and a high level of communication with their spouse. Those married 30 years or longer were generally those satisfied with their level of social support.\r"

Binding studies were performed using [125I] human EGF as ligand; two classes (high and low) of binding sites were found in placental and trophoblast cell plasma membranes. Although dissociation constants (Kd) were not significantly different in placental plasma membranes from the three stages of pregnancy, the number of binding sites increased significantly during pregnancy. The mean numbers of binding sites were 0.72 +/- 0.18 (+/- SE), 1.02 +/- 0.10, and 1.89 +/- 0.21 pmol/mg protein (high affinity sites) in plasma membrane fractions from early, middle, and term whole placentas, respectively. A similar significant increase was found when the membranes were prepared from isolated trophoblast cells. At the same time, total cellular RNA was isolated, denatured, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Then, hybridization with 32P-labeled pE 7, a cDNA of EGFR, or 32P-labeled v-erb-B oncogene, autoradiography, and densitometry were performed. The EGFR mRNA increased proportionally to the changes in EGFR during pregnancy. These results indicate that EGF-binding sites and EGFR production increase in human placentas throughout the gestational period.\r"

  ".W": "A human plasma CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP) was identified and characterized by chemical cross-linking of 125I-Tyr-hCRH to human plasma using disuccinimidyl suberate. The apparent mol wt of the cross-linked complex determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography was approximately 43,000. The mol wt was slightly lower in the nonreduced state, suggesting the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Subtracting the mol wt of 125I-Tyr-CRH, the BP appeared to have a mol wt of approximately 38,000. Binding was specific since the appearance of the 43,000 dalton band was not affected by unlabeled ACTH, vasopressin, serum albumin, or gamma-globulin, but was inhibited by unlabeled hCRH dose dependently. Pretreatment of plasma with 0.1 mol/L HCl, 0.01 mol/L NaOH, 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol, or trypsin before cross-linking abolished its ability to bind 125I-Tyr-hCRH. Rat, rabbit, or goat plasma or human cerebrospinal fluid did not bind 125I-Tyr-CRH. It is unlikely that CRH-BP is a CRH receptor, because the estimated mol wt of the CRH-BP is smaller than the reported size of CRH receptors, and the CRH-BP did not bind to ovine CRH. The binding of 125I-Tyr-CRH to CRH-BP decreased in the third trimester of pregnancy, when plasma CRH levels were markedly elevated. However, after dissociating endogenous CRH from the CRH-BP, the binding was almost the same as in nonpregnant subjects. In addition, CRH-BP inhibited CRH-induced ACTH secretion from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. We conclude that most of the increased plasma CRH found in pregnant women is bound to CRH-BP, and so is inactive, therefore plasma ACTH levels do not increase to above the normal range.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of genetic defects in the insulin receptor in the insulin resistance of lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus, we studied insulin binding, insulin receptor autophosphorylation, and insulin receptor mRNA levels and performed Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA in four siblings, all of whom have some degree of insulin resistance and three of whom have lipoatrophy. The insulin receptor concentration in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes was about 30% of normal in all three lipoatrophic siblings (LA1, LA2, and LA3) and was 55% of normal in the nonlipoatrophic sibling (LAS). Insulin receptor mRNA concentrations in the lymphocytes paralleled insulin binding and ranged from 15-67% of the mean normal level. Insulin binding to fibroblasts was also reduced about 50% in the lipoatrophic siblings. In addition, insulin binding to fibroblasts of LAS and LA2 exhibited a rightward shift of the competition curve, suggesting reduced receptor affinity [ED50, 35 and 50 ng/mL (5845 and 8350 pmol/L); normal, 1-3 ng/mL (167-501 pmol/L)]. Receptor autophosphorylation determined using Triton X-100 extracts of the fibroblasts was decreased in LA1 and LA3, but normal in LA2 and LAS. Using restriction enzyme digests of genomic DNA and probes spanning the entire cDNA of the insulin receptor, no gross alterations in receptor gene structure were detected in any members of this family. In 2 of the lipoatrophic siblings (LA1 and LA3) and in the sibling with insulin resistance but no lipoatrophy (LAS), a unique variant BamHI site was detected using a probe to the alpha-subunit region. This site was not found in 200 normal or diabetic insulin receptor alleles. By use of probes 5' and 3' to the alpha-subunit probe and by genomic cloning analysis, this variant BamHI site was localized to an intron in the insulin receptor gene downstream of exon 3 which encodes amino acids 191-296 of the alpha-subunit of the receptor. These data indicate the complex nature of familial lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus, with alterations in insulin receptor expression and/or function in both clinically affected and non-affected siblings. Both the reduced insulin binding and reduced levels of insulin receptor mRNA in the lipoatrophic siblings suggest that an insulin receptor gene defect contributes to this syndrome. Several members of this family also carry a unique variant insulin receptor gene, which, however, could not be linked to a specific alteration in receptor expression or the presence of lipoatrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients were studied who underwent thallium-201 stress-redistribution single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) both before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 15) or transluminal coronary angioplasty (n = 6). All patients underwent thallium imaging 15 min, 4 h and late (18 to 72 h) after stress as part of the preintervention thallium-201 scintigram. In a total of 201 tomographic myocardial segments with definite post-stress thallium-201 perfusion defects in which the relevant coronary arteries were subsequently successfully reperfused, the 4 h redistribution images did not predict the postintervention scintigraphic improvement: 67 (85%) of the 79 4 h reversible as well as 88 (72%) of the 122 4 h nonreversible segments improved (p = NS). The 18 to 72 h late redistribution images effectively subcategorized the 4 h nonreversible segments with respect to postintervention scintigraphic improvement: 70 (95%) of the 74 late reversible segments improved after intervention, whereas only 18 (37%) of the 48 late nonreversible segments improved (p less than 0.0001). The frequency of late reversible defects and the frequency of postrevascularization improvement of late nonreversible defects are probably overestimated by this study because of referral biases. The cardiac counts and target to background ratios from late redistribution studies resulted in satisfactory cardiac images for visual interpretation. For optimal assessment of the extent of viable myocardium by thallium-201 scintigraphic studies, late redistribution imaging should be performed when nonreversible defects are observed on 4 h redistribution images.\r"

  ".W": "Among 103 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of obstructed aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts at the Mayo Clinic, six grafts from 5 patients were available for histopathologic examination. The interval from graft insertion to angioplasty ranged from 5 to 105 months and that from angioplasty to graft excision ranged from 6 h to 24 months. Angioplasty produced intimal fissures in three grafts initially obstructed by intimal fibromuscular proliferation. Healing and restenosis resulted from filling of lacerations with fibrocellular tissue and apparently also from restitution of muscular tone. In two of three grafts initially narrowed by atherosclerosis, balloon angioplasty cause extensive plaque rupture and restenosis resulted from extrusion of plaque debris and secondary luminal thrombosis. In the third graft, angioplasty produced no distinct lesions and late restenosis was due to progressive atherosclerosis of the vein graft. Atheroembolization was observed in both patients with plaque rupture and was associated with reoperation in one and death in the other. In conclusion, the results derived from six saphenous vein bypass grafts subjected to balloon angioplasty indicate that restenosis may result from intimal fibrocellular proliferation, thrombosis, restitution of muscular tone and progressive atherosclerosis. Symptomatic atheroembolization may occur in grafts greater than 1 year old.\r"

As a result, suspended LC were triple-stained as follows: gold particles of 40 nm revealed the CD1 a antigen; gold particles of 20 nm revealed the HLA-DR antigen; and gold particles of 5 nm revealed the CD4 antigen. All the observed epidermal Birbeck granule-bearing LC were triple IG stained, thus simultaneously expressing the three surface differentiation antigens, which are therefore different from but coexisting with each other. The present investigation assesses the constant simultaneous expression by Birbeck granules bearing LC of not only CD1a and HLA-DR antigens, but also CD4 antigen. The occurrence is therefore excluded of both CD1a-positive HLA-DR-negative LC subpopulation and CD4-negative LC subpopulation, presumably due to the different sensitivity of the various procedures performed. The hypothetical occurrence of CD4-positive, CD1a-, and/or HLA-DR-negative LC subpopulations is ruled out. This study reaffirms indeed the high specificity and sensitivity of the IG-IEM method for a precise detection of the cell surface antigens of LC, and states the suitability of the IG labeling even for accurate multiple IEM stainings of LC.\r"

The extent to which patients engage in alternative therapies such as faith healing, however, is not fully known. To further explore patients' involvement in faith healing, a cross-sectional survey was administered to 207 patients in one rural family practice. Most respondents (58 percent) reported that faith healers are \"quacks,\" but 29 percent believed that faith healers can help some people who physicians cannot help. Twenty-one percent had attended a faith-healing service. Six percent stated they had actually been healed by faith healers, and 15 percent reported they personally knew someone who had been healed. Participation in faith-healing services was significantly higher among blacks (P less than .01) and those with less than a high school education (P less than .01). The finding that many patients embrace faith healing has implications for traditional family practice and may explain why patients sometimes reject medical treatment. Physicians need to be sensitive to patients' beliefs about \"faith,\" and must determine the extent to which patients reject the scientific approach before physicians can become effective \"healers.\"\r"

Patients were studied when they presented with radiological or clinical deterioration after an initial period of posttreatment stabilization. Forty studies were performed in 34 patients. The 82Rb was used as a blood-brain barrier tracer to localize the lesion. Uptake of 18F-FDG by the lesion was then compared to uptake by adjacent brain in order to make a diagnosis of active tumor recurrence (higher or equal lesion uptake) or no active tumor (lower uptake). Radiation injury was diagnosed by the exclusion of active tumor. A retrospective clinical diagnosis was established in 38 cases by following the patients' progress for 8 to 142 weeks after the PET study. In two cases, no follow-up diagnosis could be determined. The PET results agreed with the follow-up diagnosis in 15 of 17 cases of active tumor and 17 of 21 cases of radiation injury. Histological examination of surgically resected tissue obtained after the PET study was performed in 18 patients (nine with tumor regrowth and nine with radiation injury). This showed apparently viable tumor as well as necrosis in all cases, regardless of eventual clinical outcome. Some cells from the irradiated volume may appear morphologically intact, but have little or no metabolic or clinical activity. The functional nature of the PET-FDG technique allows diagnosis of tumor activity, which cannot be demonstrated by anatomic imaging studies or by histological examination. The addition of a blood-brain barrier tracer to the 18F-FDG study aids in differentiating normal brain uptake from tumor activity and improves the accuracy of the technique.\r"

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) caused concentration-dependent, potent contractions of the cerebral vessels both in the presence and in the absence of endothelium. In contrast to the response to noradrenaline (NA) and K+, the NPY effect was not altered by changes in the extracellular Ca++ concentration. The relaxant action of the calcium antagonist nifedipine on NPY-evoked contraction of cerebral arteries was not inhibited by a Ca++-deficient medium or by a high-Ca++ medium. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and capsaicin caused relaxation of precontracted cerebral arteries with an intact endothelium. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was the most potent dilatory agent, and removal of the endothelium did not change the CGRP response. In contrast, the ability of SP to cause relaxation was abolished after removal of the endothelium. Capsaicin, which activates sensory nerves, induced long-lasting relaxation in both the presence and absence of endothelium. In conclusion, in contrast to earlier reported data, the contractile effect of NPY seems to be largely independent of extracellular Ca++, while NA- and K+-induced contractions are dependent on extracellular Ca++. The present results suggest that the relaxant effect of nifedipine on cerebral blood vessels may involve actions other than inhibition of Ca++ influx. The relaxant effect of capsaicin is likely to be induced by release of CGRP rather than SP. The potent effects of these peptides on human pial arteries suggest that neuropeptides may be involved in the control of cerebral blood flow in man.\r"

Results show inhomogeneity of the 201TI distributions at stress and delay: septal to lateral wall count ratios are less than 1.0 in both females and males; anterior to inferior wall count ratios are greater than 1.0 in males but are approximately equal to 1.0 in females. Washout rate is faster in females than males at the same peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure, despite lower exercise time. These important differences suggest that quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomographic 201TI images requires gender-matched normal files.\r"

  ".W": "The detection of scattered radiation is recognized as one of the major sources of error in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this work three scatter correction techniques have been assessed and compared. Scatter coefficients and parameters characteristic of each technique have been calculated through Monte Carlo simulations and experimentally measured for various source geometries. Their dependence on the source/matter distribution and their spatial non-stationarity have been described. Each of the three scatter correction methods has then been tested on several SPECT phantom studies. The three methods provided comparable results. Following scatter compensation, both image quality and quantitative accuracy improved. In particular a slight improvement in spatial resolution and a statistically significant increase in cold lesion contrast, hot lesion recovery coefficient, and signal/noise ratio have been demonstrated with all methods.\r"

  ".W": "To provide optimal image quality, digital filters should account for both the count level and the object imaged. That is, they should be image-dependent. By using the constraint equation of constrained least-squares (CLS) restoration to determine one parameter of the Metz filter, a filter which adapts to the image has been developed. This filter has been named the Constrained Least-Squares Metz filter. The filter makes use of a regression relation to convert the Metz filter parameter determined using the CLS criterion to the value which would minimize the normalized mean square error (NMSE). The regression relation and the parameters which specify the general form of the Metz filter were determined using images of the Alderson liver and spleen phantoms. The designed filter was tested for its ability to adapt to other objects with images from each of three different test objects. When the values of the Metz filter parameters for these images determined by the CLS-Metz filter were compared by a regression analysis to those which minimized the NMSE for each image, a correlation coefficient of 0.98, a slope of 0.95, and a zero intercept of 0.1 were obtained. With clinical images, the CLS-Metz filter has been shown to provide consistently good image quality with images as diverse as heart perfusion images and bone studies.\r"

  ".W": "Reduced folates have been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by stabilizing the 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate-thymidylate synthase complex, thus increasing the block in the DNA synthetic pathway. Using an in vitro colorimetric [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] cytotoxicity assay, we tested the effects of 5-FU and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) with and without leucovorin (LV) on a panel of 11 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. The effect of LV on 5-FU and FdUrd was quantitatively similar. A clinically achievable level of LV (20 microM) increased the cytotoxicity in all three replicate experiments in 10 of the 11 cell lines (P less than .05, binomial test). LV alone at a concentration of 20 microM had no effect on cell survival. In three cell lines, 50% inhibition of growth occurred at a clinically achievable area under the curve of 5-FU alone. With the addition of LV, one additional cell line showed 50% growth inhibition at a clinically achievable level of 5-FU. Hence large clinical trials may be necessary to detect a significant improvement in survival as a result of adding LV to the fluorinated pyrimidines.\r"
