  ".W": "The interpretation of aspiration cytologic smears that contain a predominance of follicular components often presents a dilemma to the clinician who is treating a patient who has a dominant thyroid nodule, especially when thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression does not produce any significant involution of the dominant nodule. We reviewed a consecutive series of 555 fine-needle aspiration cytologic examinations of dominant thyroid nodules. All specimens that contained colloid or follicular cells mixed with lymphocytes or Hurthle cells were excluded from this review. Additionally, nine aspirates contained degenerated follicular cells with insufficient material for cytologic diagnosis. The remaining 76 specimens contained a predominance of follicular cells: 27 specimens were interpreted as containing \"normal\" follicular cells, and the remaining 49 specimens were read as \"atypical\" follicular cells. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimens indicated a 60% incidence of neoplasia (30% carcinoma, 30% adenoma) in which the aspiration cytologic study was interpreted as \"normal\" follicular cells. On the other hand, a 63% incidence of neoplasia (27% carcinoma, 36% adenoma) occurred in which the cytologic study was read as \"atypical.\" In conclusion, aspirates showing a predominance of follicular cells, whether \"normal\" or \"atypical\" indicate a 60% incidence of neoplasia in dominant thyroid nodules that do not decrease significantly in size with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential use of intraoperative intact parathormone measurements to predict curative parathyroidectomy, we measured ionized calcium (Cai) levels and parathormone levels in 33 patients with hyperparathyroidism who underwent exploratory bilateral neck surgery. Nineteen patients each had a solitary adenoma, 13 patients had hyperplasia, and one patient had four normal parathyroid glands. These results were compared to the results for 37 patients who underwent either thyroid lobectomy (TL) (n = 10) or near-total thyroidectomy (NTT) (n = 27) and of 14 control patients who underwent miscellaneous operations. Parathormone decline after curative parathyroidectomy was 86.4 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SE), which was significantly greater than a decline of 25.7% +/- 9.8% in three patients with persistent postoperative hyperparathyroidism (p less than 0.01). Declines were 38.5% +/- 8.7% after TL (p less than 0.01), 52.2% +/- 5.9% after NTT (p less than 0.01), and 8.3% +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.01), in the control patients. An intraoperative Cai decline of 4.0% +/- 0.6% after curative parathyroidectomy did not differ significantly from the results after TL, NTT, or miscellaneous operations in the control patients. Patients with persistent postoperative hyperparathyroidism had the greatest decline in Cai levels (7.1% +/- 2.3%; p less than 0.05). From these data we conclude that (1) a decline in parathormone level of 70% or more 20 minutes after parathyroidectomy is predictive of cure, (2) thyroidectomy, even unilaterally, produces a significant decline in parathormone level that affects interpretation of intraoperative parathormone level changes, (3) Cai level because of its slow decline is not useful in predicting effective parathyroidectomy, and (4) measurement of intraoperative parathormone level changes should not be used as a substitute for exploratory bilateral neck surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91019878\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiac function of 30 patients who were morbidly obese was studied before bariatric surgery. Twelve patients were studied 13 +/- 4 months after surgery. These patients had a mean age of 37.1 +/- 2.9 years and a body mass index of 50.0 +/- 1.4 kg/m2. Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, radionuclide angiography scanning, and right heart catheterization. To determine the degree of cardiac dysfunction, the patients were studied with exercise and intravenous fluid challenges. Ultrasonography produced evidence of myocardial thickening with an increased interventricular septum in eight patients (32%) and increased left ventricular mass in 17 patients (53%). The radionuclide scan suggested that morbid obesity was associated with a significantly (p less than 0.05) increased end-diastolic volume and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction as compared with patients who were of normal weight. With exercise the patient who was of normal weight had an increase in the end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and heart rate, but the patient who was morbidly obese only increased heart rate to produce the necessary increase in cardiac output. Right heart catheterization indicated that the relationship of the pulmonary wedge pressure and the left ventricular stroke work index was abnormal in 14 of 29 patients (48.3%) and depressed in six of 29 patients (20.7%) with exercise. One liter of fluid caused an abnormal relationship of the pulmonary wedge pressure and the left ventricular stroke work index in 12 of 30 patients (40%) and a depressed response in 10 of 30 patients (33.3%). Cardiac studies were repeated in 12 patients after a 54.8 +/- 1.9 kg weight loss. Echocardiography indicated a decrease in dilatation (27.3% to 9.1%) and a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in hypertrophy (45.5% to 0%). After the weight loss, radionuclide and right heart catheterization studies indicated improved cardiac function with reduced filling pressures and increased left ventricular work during fluid and exercise challenges. These results support the presence of obesity-related cardiomyopathy with ventricular dysfunction, which appears to be caused by a noncompliant ventricle. Significant weight loss achieved with gastroplasty results in increased ventricular compliance and improved cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Trends in smoking associated respiratory diseases in England and Wales during 1941-85 have been studied, with careful attention to problems caused by changes in classification of cause of death. Three diseases were selected for analysis: lung cancer, emphysema, and chronic obstructive lung disease. During 1971-85 deaths that would previously have been certified under chronic bronchitis have increasingly tended to be classified under chronic airways obstruction. The definition of chronic obstructive lung disease that was used includes both terms to avoid the artificial decline caused by consideration of chronic bronchitis in isolation. Age specific rates for all three diseases show a pronounced cohort (period of birth) pattern, rates for men rising up to the rates for those born shortly after the turn of the century and then declining, and rates for women peaking in the cohort born 20-25 years later. For chronic obstructive lung disease, but not for lung cancer and emphysema, the cohort peak is superimposed on a sharply declining downward trend. In both sexes cohort patterns of cumulative cigarette consumption peak at a time broadly similar to those seen for the three diseases. Trends in cigarette consumption, however, cannot explain the underlying steeply declining rate of chronic obstructive lung disease. Nor can they fully explain the declining trends in lung cancer and emphysema rates in younger men and women.\r"

The pre-glue is prepared from a single donor (to avoid the problems of pooled plasma) and stored as cryoprecipitate. Before being used it is thawed, dissolved in saline, and activated into an adhesive by the addition of topical thrombin. Biological glue was used prophylactically to prevent air leaks from bronchial suture lines and raw lung surfaces after pulmonary resections in six patients. In addition two new methods of using biological glue have been developed for the control of persisting air leaks. In selective intrabronchial tamponade the glue is instilled into the bronchial tree through a flexible bronchoscope, and in therapeutic pleurodesis it is instilled into the pleural cavity through a chest drainage tube. The air leaks were resolved in all cases. Seven procedures using selective intrabronchial tamponade were carried out in six patients. Four were immediately successful but three were not and required further interventions. Therapeutic pleurodesis alone was successfully carried out in one patient and as an adjunct to selective intrabronchial tamponade on two occasions. A thoracotomy was eventually needed in one of the seven patients.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relation between lung function and inflammation and fibrosis in patients with diffuse lung fibrosis, a study was made of untreated patients without appreciable airway obstruction (14 patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and seven with pneumoconiosis). Quantitative assessment of inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis was carried out on open lung biopsy specimens and compared with lung volumes, carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO), TLCO corrected for alveolar volume (TLCO/VA), and arterial blood gases at rest and during exercise. The degree of fibrosis and the degree of cellular infiltration were positively correlated. Lung volumes and TLCO were correlated with the grades of fibrosis and cellular infiltration of alveoli; arterial blood gases during exercise tended to correlate with both fibrosis and infiltration (p less than 0.06). In contrast, morphological data were not correlated with gas exchange at rest or with TLCO/VA. It is concluded that, in untreated patients with diffuse lung fibrosis, lung volumes, TLCO, and arterial blood gases during exercise reflect the lung lesions, and that the pulmonary function tests used cannot discriminate between fibrosis and infiltration of the lung by inflammatory cells.\r"

Six such lesions were seen in five lungs from a series of 35 pairs of lungs studied at necropsy. All were immunoreactive for neurone-specific enolase, protein gene product 9.5, and a range of neuroendocrine products. Of the peptides found in neuroendocrine cells in normal human lungs, gastrin releasing peptide was present in all tumourlets and calcitonin in all but one; none contained leucineenkephalin. Of a series of peptide and protein hormones not present in the neuroendocrine cells of healthy human lungs, growth hormone was present in all six tumourlets and adrenocorticotrophin in two. Identical patterns of peptide expression were displayed by neuroendocrine cells in the airway associated with the tumourlets in two cases. Such cells were increased in number and abnormally clustered. Aberrant expression of peptides might accompany the morphological changes in the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells seen in diseased lungs, their florid focal proliferation occasionally resulting in the formation of a tumourlet.\r"

Lung scans were described as normal (n = 66) or as showing a low (n = 292), indeterminate (n = 58), or high probability (n = 79) of pulmonary embolism. There was a difference between the mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml; low probability scans, 295 ng/ml; indeterminate probability scans, 510 ng/ml; high probability scans, 952 ng/ml (p less than 0.001). Of the patients with high probability scans, 96% had raised concentrations. Explanations for discrepant low results include incorrect scan diagnosis, delay in blood sampling, and anticoagulation. Of the patients with a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, 43% had increased concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products that could be attributed in most cases to another illness. Owing to the wide range of values in each lung scan diagnostic category, raised concentrations of these fibrin degradation products cannot be used without reference to the patient's clinical state as a discriminatory test for pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation of the significance of normal concentrations in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism appears to be warranted.\r"

Guinea pigs were given iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue and potent pulmonary vasodilator, and noradrenaline, a pulmonary vasoconstrictor, in an attempt to increase and decrease respectively the blood volume in the lungs. Neither agent altered transferrin accumulation in the lung by comparison with a saline infusion. Iloprost infused before and after oleic acid infusion reduced macro-molecular leakage when compared with oleic acid alone.

Seven subjects inhaled three breaths of four doses of capsaicin (0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 nmol) before and immediately after inhaling PGF2 alpha (0.1 mumol) or placebo (0.15M NaCl) on separate days. The numbers of capsaicin induced coughs were greater after PGF2 alpha (mean 42.3 coughs) than after 0.15M sodium chloride (30.1). Visual analogue scores (0-10 on a 10 cm continuous scale) showed that capsaicin was more irritant after PGF2 alpha than after saline. Total respiratory resistance (Rrs), measured by the forced oscillation technique, was unaltered throughout the study. A double blind, placebo controlled study of the effects of inhaled salbutamol (200 micrograms, 0.6 mumol) and ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms, 0.1 mumol) on cough induced by capsaicin (2.4 nmol) and by PGF2 alpha (0.1 mumol) and on PGF2 alpha augmented, capsaicin induced coughing was performed in seven subjects. Neither drug had any effect on capsaicin induced coughing. Salbutamol reduced coughing due to PGF2 alpha (mean 7.7 coughs after salbutamol, 9.3 after placebo) but ipratropium bromide did not (mean 6.9 coughs after ipratropium bromide, 6.6 after placebo). Salbutamol also inhibited the augmentation of the capsaicin induced cough that followed inhalation of PGF2 alpha (mean augmentation 1.9 coughs after salbutamol, 4.1 after placebo), whereas ipratropium bromide did not (augmentation 1.7 coughs after ipratropium bromide, 2.7 after placebo). No changes in Rrs were seen after PGF2 alpha or either drug. Thus salbutamol reduces PGF2 alpha induced cough and the augmentation of capsaicin induced cough that follows PGF2 alpha.\r"

Pleurodesis may prevent recurrence of the effusion; many agents and techniques have been described. A questionnaire was sent to 448 clinicians in the United Kingdom to determine how pleurodesis is performed in practice. There was a 56% overall response, with replies from 101 respiratory physicians, 88 general physicians, 29 thoracic surgeons, and 35 general surgeons. General surgeons saw few cases of malignant pleural effusion and rarely performed pleurodesis. A patient with recurrent malignant pleural effusion would usually be managed with pleurodesis by 76 (76%) respiratory physicians, 26 (30%) general physicians, and 23 (81%) thoracic surgeons; a further 29 (33%) general physicians would refer such patients to another specialist. Most medical pleurodesis were performed by junior staff, whereas consultant thoracic surgeons were more likely to be concerned with the procedure. All the thoracic surgeons used an intercostal tube drain, usually with suction. An intercostal tube drain was used routinely by only 54 (54%) of the respiratory physicians and 28 (32%) general physicians. Thoracic surgeons preferred talc for pleurodesis whereas physicians most commonly used tetracycline. The variety of methods in use supports the need for randomised, controlled studies to determine the most effective technique of pleurodesis.\r"

The management protocol consists of an assessment sheet for recording essential features of the history and examination findings and a flow diagram with guidelines for initial management that were based on spirometric recordings. The protocol was introduced at Wellington Hospital in 1986. The effect of this intervention was assessed by analysing emergency department records during the three months before and one year after the introduction of the protocol. The use of the assessment sheet improved history taking and led to the increased use of serial measures of airflow obstruction and improved documentation of follow up arrangements. The provision of management guidelines influenced the emphasis of management, including an increased use of corticosteroids intravenously and more frequent use of an additional dose of nebulised bronchodilator. In the light of the initial experience the protocol has been modified and its use either in an emergency department or in general practice is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have not agreed on the incidence of ischemic stroke in persons with Parkinson's disease. There are epidemiologic and neurochemical facets of Parkinson's disease that might confer some benefit or protection against ischemic stroke. We used a case-control method to determine the lifetime history of ischemic stroke in 200 patients with Parkinson's disease and 200 controls of a similar age range. Analysis was also carried out for myocardial infarction as a marker of generalized atherosclerotic disease and for stroke risk factors. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly less in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls, as was the cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction. Among risk factors, significantly fewer patients with Parkinson's disease used tobacco than controls. The decreased incidence of ischemic stroke in the patients with Parkinson's disease appears to be related to their less severe generalized atherosclerosis, possibly due to their lower incidence of tobacco use. In view of the known potential for dopamine to exacerbate experimental ischemic tissue damage, the possibility that the dopamine deficiency in the central nervous system of persons with Parkinson's disease confers an additional specific protective benefit against ischemic stroke cannot be excluded and requires further study.\r"

These studies allowed quantification of the regional hemodynamic status, especially in relation to watershed areas. Compared with eight normal controls, the patients had significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory and the surrounding watershed areas of the occluded hemisphere. The oxygen extraction fraction rose with the distance from the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, attaining the highest value in the superior parietal and posterior temporo-occipital watershed area. A concomitant decrease in the cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood volume ratio suggested reduction in the mean blood flow velocity, whereby elevated blood viscosity would be more liable to reduce cerebral blood flow. These findings suggest hemodynamic vulnerability of the watershed areas after internal carotid artery occlusion in persons with good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis. Our results also emphasize the importance of systemic hemodynamic factors such as blood pressure and circulating blood volume in the genesis of watershed infarction.\r"

The lipid profiles of the 53 patients suffering lacunar infarction were similar on both occasions, the only significant differences being higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. No significant changes were observed among the 35 patients suffering cerebral hemorrhage apart from a significantly higher concentration of high density lipoprotein3-cholesterol less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. Our study, with many patients classified according to stroke subtype, gives results different from those of previous studies with much fewer patients. We conclude that in studies of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations as risk factors for cerebral infarction, comparing values obtained less than or equal to 48 hours after admission with control values may incorrectly identify certain lipid fractions as risk factors.\r"

Overall mortality was 27%, 22% of 58 patients aged less than 70 years and 33% of 42 patients aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Hypertensive putaminal hematoma showed the highest mortality rate (42%, 10 of 24 cases). Chronic alcoholism and anticoagulant medication influenced the mortality rate unfavourably. We found the following localizations and etiologies to have a specific relation with age: 1) lobar hematomas from vascular malformations, group aged less than 40 years; 2) hypertensive putaminal hematomas and hypertensive thalamic hematomas, group aged 40-69 years; and 3) lobar hematomas, group aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Alcoholism was an additional factor in 38% of the 13 middle-aged men with hypertensive putaminal hematomas. Fourteen cases of spontaneous intracerebral hematoma were possibly due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Six of these 14 patients had recurrent lobar hematomas, but only three of the six could be histologically investigated. In these three cases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy was proven.\r"

Leukoaraiosis was observed in 21 (18%) of the 116 patients and in 12 (8%) of the 155 controls (p less than 0.01).

Leukoaraiosis was significantly correlated with intracerebral hemorrhage after controlling for age and sex by using multiple logistic regression analysis, while the correlation disappeared after controlling for hypertension.

Rapid hemodilution to a target hematocrit of 30-35% as monitored with bedside determinations was achieved by using infusions of dextran 40, venesections, and infusions of additional crystalloid solution when necessary. There was no difference in the death rate between the two treatment groups. Of these 47 patients, 37 (19 in the hemodilution group and 18 in the control group) could be followed up for the entire study period of 3 months. The relative improvement in neurologic function from day 1 to days 8, 21, and 90 was significantly better in the hemodilution group than in the control group. In accordance, special tests for fine motor control of the paretic arm disclosed better performance in the hemodilution group. The frequency of patients with severe disability was significantly lower in the hemodilution group on days 8 and 21. Plasma viscosity (measured in 11 patients) was not affected by infusions of dextran 40. Vigorous hypervolemic hemodilution in patients with acute ischemic stroke is well tolerated and improves early neurologic outcome with an effect lasting at least 3 months.\r"

A novel group of drugs, the 21-aminosteroids, have been observed to reduce neurologic damage and vasogenic cerebral edema in animal models of stroke by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Production of hydrogen peroxide and free radicals by leukocytes during the inflammatory response may contribute to lipid peroxidation and other consequences of free radical-mediated tissue injury. We assessed the effect of U74500A, a 21-aminosteroid, on the generation of hydrogen peroxide by and on the chemiluminescence of stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes from normal humans. U74500A significantly reduced the generation of hydrogen peroxide by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (p less than 0.001) and monocytes (p less than 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. Monocyte chemiluminescence was also significantly inhibited (p less than 0.05), but polymorphonuclear leukocyte-associated chemiluminescence was unchanged. Our results indicate that U74500A can reduce the concentration of oxygen metabolites associated with stimulated human leukocytes, and this effect may explain in part how 21-aminosteroids reduce lipid peroxidation, ischemic injury, and vasogenic edema.\r"

The method also proved valuable for measuring small residual flow during vascular occlusion.

  ".W": "It is well established that excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters are extensively liberated during ischemia and that they have neurotoxic properties contributing to neuronal injury. To study changes in the liberation of excitatory and other amino acids during cerebral ischemia, we measured their extracellular concentrations and related them to blood flow levels and electrophysiologic activity (electrocorticogram and auditory evoked potentials) before and for up to 2 hours after multiple cerebral vessel occlusion in 14 anesthetized cats. Blood flow levels between 0 and 43 ml/100 g/min were reached. Concentrations of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters increased most (aspartate 10-fold, glutamate 30-fold, and gamma-aminobutyric acid 300-fold compared with control values) below a blood flow threshold of 20 ml/100 g/min. The total power of the electrocorticogram and the amplitude of the auditory evoked potentials were affected below the same blood flow threshold. In contrast, concentrations of the nontransmitter amino acids taurine, alanine, asparagine, serine, and glutamine increased 1.5-5-fold as blood flow decreased, while concentrations of the essential amino acids phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine did not change during cerebral ischemia. The great increases in concentrations of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters below a blood flow threshold close to that for functional disturbance is in accordance with the role of these amino acids in ischemic cell damage. Their release at blood flow levels compatible with cell survival and the increase in their concentrations with severity and duration of cerebral ischemia imply that excitotoxic antagonists may have potential as therapeutic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of inflammation, which has untoward effects on cerebrovascular and neural elements. While several investigators have reported attenuation of ischemic damage after treatment with antagonists of platelet-activating factor, no study has proved endogenous production of platelet-activating factor in ischemia of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that endogenous production of platelet-activating factor participates in the early pathologic manifestations of deteriorating stroke. In 12 rabbits, we found tissue levels of platelet-activating factor measured by the release of serotonin from washed platelets to be elevated by approximately 20-fold in spinal cord injured by 25 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion (2.80 +/- 0.98 ng/g) compared with that in normal spinal cord (0.15 +/- 0.06 ng/g, p less than 0.01). Given during ischemia to seven rabbits, 10 mg/kg i.p. of a highly selective and potent antagonist of platelet-activating factor (BN 50739) accentuated the early postischemic hyperemia and prevented the delayed hypoperfusion measured by on-line laser-Doppler flowmetry (-35 +/- 7% of baseline [n = 7] without versus 33 +/- 14% with treatment, p less than 0.01) and the edema formation measured as the increase in tissue water content (4.4 +/- 0.7% without [n = 6] versus 2.1 +/- 0.6% with [n = 7]treatment, p less than 0.05) after 2 hours of reperfusion. This neurochemical and pharmacologic evidence emphasizes a new perspective of ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation and suggests an important role for platelet-activating factor in the early manifestations of stroke.\r"

An ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis, 25 mmol/kg i.p. butanediol was injected every 3 hours to produce a sustained increase in the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Treatment significantly attenuated ischemia-induced metabolic changes by increasing the concentrations of phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and glycogen and by reducing the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate. Lactate concentration 2, 6, and 12 hours after embolization decreased by 13%, 44%, and 46%, respectively. Brain water content increased from 78.63% in six unembolized rats to 80.93% in 12 saline-treated and 79.57% in seven butanediol-treated rats 12 hours after embolization. (p less than 0.05). The decrease in water content was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium and chloride. The antiedema effect of butanediol could not be explained by an osmotic mechanism since equimolar doses of urea or ethanol were ineffective. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of butanediol is mediated through cerebral utilization of ketone bodies arising from butanediol metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis and the deleterious accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia.\r"

Autologous blood placed around the basilar artery of rabbits killed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 days later caused narrowing of the segments with a biphasic time course. The first (immediate) phase was reversed by intra-arterial papaverine; the second phase exhibited an increasing component of narrowing that was papaverine-insensitive. Based on the passive force/length curves, basilar artery segments became increasingly stiff over 9 days. By contrast, the segments' contractility decreased. Responses of the basilar artery segments were greater over the first few days, but then became less than that of saline-injected controls. Contractions in response to norepinephrine and potassium were reduced. Endothelium-based acetylcholine-induced vasodilation progressively diminished, as did the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. There was a negative correlation between artery wall stiffness and contractility. The papaverine-insensitive component of angiographic narrowing correlated directly with loss of contractility and with artery wall stiffness. These results are consistent with the conclusion that increased artery wall stiffness is a primary determining factor in the arterial narrowing of chronic cerebrovasospasm.\r"

In this ischemia model, severe shrinkage of the ipsilateral half of the thalamus was observed several months after surgery. We examined the serial profile of this phenomenon in 40 rats at intervals from 2 weeks to 6 months after the operation. The area of the ipsilateral half of the thalamus as a percentage of the area of the contralateral half was 87% at 2 weeks, 77% at 1 month, 54% at 3 months, and 54% at 6 months. Such severe morphologic change distant from the original ischemic focus has not been reported in models of experimental focal ischemia. Retrograde degeneration is thought to play an important role in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "91020276\r", 
  ".W": "Previous therapeutic studies on the prevention of selective vulnerability of neurons in the hippocampus have suggested that the critical period for induction of delayed neuronal injury occurs early during recirculation. To determine the onset and duration of this period, an ultrashort-acting barbiturate (methohexital) was infused into the left carotid artery of 47 gerbils after various times of recirculation following 10 minutes of bilateral forebrain ischemia. Neuronal density in the left CA1 sector was determined 7 days later by counting the number of surviving neurons per millimeter of pyramidal cell layer. In 16 saline-treated gerbils, less than 10% of the CA1 neurons survived the 10 minutes of ischemia. Postischemic carotid infusion of methohexital improved neuronal survival, the degree of improvement depending on the timing and duration of the methohexital infusion. When carried out during the initial 40 minutes of recirculation, methohexital infusion for 10 minutes increased the number of surviving neurons to approximately 60% of that in five sham-operated control gerbils. This increase was significant for infusions carried out between the 10th and 20th minutes (n = 6, p less than 0.05) and between the 30th and 40th minutes (n = 6, p less than 0.05) of recirculation. Methohexital infusion for 20 minutes increased neuronal survival to 95% and 73% of that in the controls when carried out between the 0th and 20th minutes (n = 5, p less than 0.005) and between the 20th and 40th minutes (n = 5, p less than 0.005) of recirculation, respectively. Protection was nonsignificant for 10- or 20-minute methohexital infusions carried out after the 40th minute of recirculation. Our results demonstrate that the pathologic processes leading to delayed neuronal injury in the CA1 sector are induced during the initial 40 minutes of recirculation and that barbiturates are able to reverse these processes only if given during this period.\r"

  ".W": "Brain and retinal infarctions during sleep have been attributed to focal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension combined with underlying arterial stenosis, rather than to embolism. Because some retinal emboli may be visualized on ophthalmoscopy, we studied 24 consecutive patients (18 men and six women) aged 26-78 (mean 58) years with recent retinal infarction and determined whether the infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. All patients underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy and a carotid artery study (arteriography in 20, duplex ultrasound in the remaining four), and 12 had echocardiography. Retinal infarction occurred during sleep at an unexpectedly rate (14 of 24 observed compared with eight of 24 expected, p = 0.02). Retinal cholesterol emboli were seen in one half of the patients regardless of whether the retinal infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. Carotid artery disease was found in seven of the 14 patients in whom infarction had occurred during sleep and in eight of the 10 patients in whom infarction had occurred during wakefulness (p = 0.21). Cerebrovascular occlusive disease was not found in the five patients aged less than 50 years. Our findings suggest that embolism is a common mechanism of retinal infarction during sleep or wakefulness, that in patients aged greater than 50 years extracranial carotid artery disease is a common source of retinal emboli, and that the retina may be especially susceptible to infarction during sleep.\r"

This report describes three cases illustrating this mechanism and methods of identification and correction. This mechanism of postoperative stroke adds further justification for the routine use of intraoperative surveillance studies to document the technical result of endarterectomy involving the internal and external carotid arteries. When an unsatisfactory end point is identified in the external carotid artery, it should be corrected with the same sense of concern as a similar finding in the internal carotid artery.\r"

  ".W": "Although spontaneous thrombosis of a giant intracranial aneurysm is relatively common, occlusion of its parent artery is rare. We describe two recent patients in whom the parent artery spontaneously occluded. One patient had severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, with delayed appearance of a faint shadow of vascular widening near the posterior clinoid process. One month later, complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery was shown angiographically. The second patient had dysarthria and left hemiparesis, resulting in the diagnosis of a left internal carotid artery giant aneurysm. He had suffered an episode of visual disturbance of the right eye 5 years before. Angiography showed the right cervical internal carotid artery to be occluded. We believe the mechanism of parent artery occlusion in our two patients to be due first to stretching of the internal carotid artery by the enlarged aneurysm, followed by compression of the internal carotid artery by the aneurysm itself. Next, the anterior clinoid process and the optic nerve are involved, and, finally, thrombosis of the aneurysmal cavity extends into the internal carotid artery itself.\r"

In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses. In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients. Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses. No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies. These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system. However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered.\r"

Prenatal diagnosis and HLA typing were performed in fetuses at risk for Fanconi anemia (FA) to identify, prior to birth, those that were unaffected with the syndrome and were HLA-identical to affected siblings. Umbilical cord blood was harvested at the delivery of these infants; assays of progenitor cells indicated the presence of colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in numbers similar to those of bone marrow CFU-GM that are associated with successful engraftment in HLA-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The possibility that umbilical cord blood from a single individual can be used as an alternative to bone marrow for hematopoietic reconstitution has now been demonstrated by the successful engraftment of two patients with FA. Progenitor cell assays of umbilical cord blood collected at the birth of a child affected with FA, who had been misdiagnosed on the basis of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) studies, indicated a profound deficiency in colony formation, consistent with previously reported abnormalities in the growth of FA cells in vitro. These results suggest that the hematopoietic disorder in FA is related to an underlying problem with cell proliferation.\r"

A DSTR was defined by the posttransfusion finding of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and a newly developed alloantibody specificity. A DHTR was defined as a DSTR case that showed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Thirty-four cases of DSTR, 70 percent of which were due to anti-E and/or -Jka, were documented prospectively over a 20-month period. Retrospective review of the medical records found clinical evidence of hemolysis in only 6 (18%) of the 34. Thus, the incidence of DSTR was 1 (0.66%) of 151 recipients with posttransfusion samples available for testing, whereas the incidence of DHTR was only 1 (0.12%) of 854 patients tested. Fifteen of the 34 patients were followed for up to 174 days after reaction. Twelve of the 15 still demonstrated a positive DAT with anti-IgG only. Eluate studies indicated that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR may involve several immunologic mechanisms, including the development of posttransfusion autoantibodies. This study indicates 1) that DSTRs are a frequent finding in multiply transfused patients, although most cases are benign and fail to meet rigid criteria for DHTR, and 2) that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR is common.\r"

With flow cytometry, DDAbs could be detected at drug concentrations as low as 0.1 microM, or less than one-tenth the level required with other methods. Antigen-capture ELISA was not as sensitive as flow cytometry in DDAb detection, but it did allow identification of the DDAbs' target molecules. With this assay, five of the seven DDAbs recognized both the glycoprotein Ib/IX (GPIb/IX) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complexes, while the remaining two sera reacted only with GPIb/IX. Of 44 consecutive patients who developed thrombocytopenia while taking quinidine, DDAbs were detected by flow cytometry in 11 (25%), more than twice the number detected by other methods. In one patient who developed thrombocytopenia while taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, DDAbs could be detected only by flow cytometry. It can be concluded that flow cytometry is highly sensitive in detecting DDAbs and allows their detection at pharmacologic concentrations of the drug. Most quinidine-dependent antibodies recognize at least two different glycoprotein complexes in the platelet membrane.\r"

Eligible patients had platelet counts of less than 30,000 per microL and were clinically stable. Patients were transfused with 6 to 10 units of PC stored for 3 days (15 studies) or 4 days (5 studies). Platelets were pooled and then split in two equal volumes so that each patient received two sequential half-transfusions, one incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour and the other kept at 22 degrees C for 1 hour. Patients were randomized as to which half-transfusion was received first. The mean CCI of the incubated half-transfusions was 13.6 x 10(3) when they were given first and 14.5 x 10(3) when given second; this was not significantly different from the mean CCI of the nonincubated half-transfusions: 13.8 x 10(3) when they were given first and 13.8 x 10(3) when given second.

The two groups had similar mean predonation values of internal carotid flow velocity (ICFV): blood donation was followed in both groups by a slight, transient decrease of ICFV at the end of phlebotomy, due to donation-induced hypovolemia, and then by an increase of ICFV lasting 7 to 10 days. Analysis of individual profiles revealed that only four of nine upper-limit and six of nine normal Hct donors displayed a positive trend (increase) in the ICFV within the first week after donation, and that it was due mainly to a rise in systolic flow velocity. Mean Hct and arterial oxygen content showed a negative trend (decrease) within the first week that was opposite to the ICFV trend. Other laboratory variables, including serum proteins and plasma fibrinogen concentration, and the iron status indicators did not change, except for serum ferritin, which also decreased within the first week after phlebotomy. It can be concluded that blood donation may result in a short-term increase of blood flow velocity that is independent of Hct predonation levels in approximately one-half of the donors.\r"

The latter association was still significant when higher levels of RBC-bound IgG and subclass pattern were taken into account. In samples with multiple immunoglobulin coating, there was no significant relationship (p greater than 0.05) between haptoglobins of less than 0.1 g per L and either C3d or multiple IgG subclasses. It was concluded that multiple immunoglobulin coating, even when undetected by agglutination methods, is a major cause of hemolysis: it is part of a more generalized autoimmune response and acts with other factors such as the quantity of bound IgG, the IgG subclass pattern, and complement; it also has an important hemolytic effect in its own right.\r"

On two occasions, after template bleeding time, 14 healthy volunteers underwent plateletpheresis and received 600 mg of aspirin. Autologous 111In-labeled platelets were transfused without further manipulation (control) on one occasion and after filtration on a second occasion. The filter was primed and flushed with a buffered 12.6-percent solution of ACD-A in 0.9-percent normal saline (pH 6.5). After transfusion, the bleeding time was measured at 1, 4, and 24 hours and platelet survival at 10 minutes; 1, 4, and 24 hours; and daily for 6 days. The decrease in the bleeding time was not significantly different from that after transfusion of nonfiltered platelets (p greater than 0.2). Filtering of platelets did not affect 1-hour in vivo recovery (filtered, 69.5%; nonfiltered, 66%: p = 0.56) or the platelet survival (filtered platelet t1/2 = 83.0 hours, nonfiltered platelet t1/2 = 82.9 hours: p = 0.96). It can be concluded that filtration does not adversely affect in vivo recovery, survival, or functional integrity of platelets.\r"

  ".W": "McLeod red cells (RBCs) lack Kx antigens and have weak expression of the Kell antigens. Individuals who carry the McLeod phenotype have acanthocytic RBCs and a compensated hemolytic state. To elucidate the role of the protein on which the Kx antigens reside in maintaining membrane deformability, the rheologic properties of McLeod RBCs were determined by ektacytometry. RBCs were obtained from normal individuals and from four patients with McLeod syndrome. Osmotic gradient deformability profiles of McLeod RBCs showed decreased whole cell deformability. Resealed ghosts from McLeod RBCs also showed decreased deformability, partly because of the decreased cell surface area and partly because of an intrinsic membrane stiffness in this syndrome. For the measurement of membrane mechanical stability, resealed ghosts were subjected to constant high shear stress in the ektacytomer, and deformability was recorded continuously as the deformable ghosts fragmented into rigid spherical vesicles. Membranes from McLeod RBCs showed a noticeable increase in mechanical stability. Acquired causes of acanthocytosis, such as liver disease, did not cause the rheologic abnormalities observed in McLeod cells. Other abnormalities noted in McLeod RBCs were decreased RBC potassium content and an increased number of dense RBCs, as determined by centrifugation on a discontinuous density gradient. The data indicate that McLeod RBCs are rigid and have decreased surface area and that their membranes are intrinsically rigid with increased mechanical stability. These abnormalities may account for the reduced RBC survival observed in McLeod syndrome. The protein that carries the Kx surface antigen seems to be required for the maintenance of the normal physical function of RBC skeletal proteins.\r"

The purposes of this study were to determine the frequency of WBC antibodies, to associate the severity of reactions with antibody specificity, and to distinguish FNHTRs from infection and postoperative fever. By using the granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test in conjunction with lymphocytotoxicity testing, it was found that 70 percent of FNHTRs in 24 patients involved WBC antibodies. The remaining 30 percent of apparent FNHTRs were associated with infections and postoperative fever. Granulocyte-specific antibodies were as prevalent as HLA antibodies and were associated with the severest reactions. Because FNHTRs occur with granulocyte-specific antibodies, HLA antibodies, and possible monocyte-specific antibodies (untested in this and other studies), these reactions could be grouped together as WBC-associated reactions.\r"

The direct antiglobulin test demonstrated IgG but not complement on the red cell (RBC) surface. An acid eluate reacted (titer of 4) with all panel cells in the antiglobulin phase. Intravenous immunoglobulin from the same lot used for treatment did not contain antibody that reacted with the patient's group O RBCs or a panel of group O RBCs, but did contain IgG anti-A and -B (titer of 4). The patient received a transfusion and was given methylprednisone. The direct antiglobulin test and acid eluate were negative 4 days later. The patient had an uneventful recovery. The distinction between antibody-mediated hemolytic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia is important in the treatment of this disease.\r"

Although certain strong factors have been identified (age, race, location), none sufficiently defines high-risk groups in whom recommendations should differ from those of other age-matched patients. Certainly, a strong familial tendency has been identified, but the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in these patients remains unclear. Some hypotheses on the pathogenesis of prostate cancer are possible based on the available data. Genetic factors appear to be permissive, as are hormonal influences, which are partially regulated by genetics. Environmental factors appear to be promotional in genetically susceptible men. Dietary fat may also be an important promotional factor in genetically susceptible men. Dietary factors appear to exert some influence by modulating sex hormone concentration. Several factors demand more investigation and understanding of the epidemiology of prostate cancer. The relative frequency of the disease and the increasing death rate from prostate cancer are of concern. The similarities in the incidence of latent prostate cancer among various groups with strong differences in the rate of clinically apparent disease raise significant issues regarding potential lifestyle or environmental promotional factors. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer may allow a refinement and definition of programs for prevention and early detection of the disease.\r"

Unfortunately, digital rectal examination may not be sensitive enough to detect the small-volume tumors that are most amenable to cure. In several studies, approximately 50 per cent of cancers detected through screening had already spread beyond the prostate. Regardless, the key to demonstrating overall benefit from screening is a diminished disease-specific mortality rate. To date, this has not been shown. Lower mortality rates from prostate cancer can be demonstrated only through a randomized study comparing screened and unscreened populations. Such a study, which has recently been approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, will require 10 to 15 years to complete. Until that time, the value of screening for prostate cancer by digital rectal examination or any other method will be unknown. Beyond a lack of proved benefit, screening for prostate cancer may be harmful because of the variable natural history of the disease and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with treatment. There exists a large population of patients with pathologically detectable prostate cancer who will never have clinical disease. The detection of some of these tumors may expose those patients to the risks of unnecessary treatment. Large-scale prostate cancer screening studies may ultimately be shown to be advantageous. The sooner this occurs, the earlier aggressive screening can be advocated, similar to screening for breast cancer. However, the temptation to embark on such screening programs without first demonstrating clear benefit should be resisted.\r"

  ".W": "Relatively recent changes and improvements in equipment have vastly increased image resolution for transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate. The expanded use of transrectal ultrasonography has greatly furthered knowledge of prostate zonal anatomy and permitted clinical evaluation of internal prostate architecture. The technique is operator dependent, as the quality of the results is related directly to that person's knowledge and experience. The significant majority of prostate cancers originate from the peripheral zone. Palpable stage B nodules characteristically have a hypoechoic appearance. There is disagreement about the tumor characteristics that cause hypoechogenicity, but large tumors may obscure the normal prostate anatomy and appear isoechoic because of the lack of contrast with surrounding prostate tissue. The transition zone of the prostate is the origin of benign prostatic hyperplasia and almost 20 per cent of prostate cancers. These tumors probably correspond to most stage A lesions. Transrectal ultrasonography is less accurate in identifying transition zone tumors because of the mixed echogenicity of the transition zone, interference from prostatic calculi or calcified corpora amylacea, and poorer image resolution in this area. Studies evaluating the use of transrectal ultrasonography for early detection of prostate cancer generally have shown a twofold increase in the detection rate compared with digital rectal examination. However, the decreased morbidity and expense of transrectal prostate biopsy using an automatic gun device have increased the frequency of biopsy in ultrasound-examined patients compared with those historically evaluated by digital rectal examination. The increased detection rate may in part be a function of the increased use of biopsies, independent of other factors. Transrectal ultrasonography rarely detects cancer in patient with normal digital rectal examination and a normal serum prostate-specific antigen level. Transrectal ultrasonography may be capable of identifying early capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion in some patients with known prostate cancer. However, its superiority to digital rectal examination for this purpose has not been demonstrated unequivocally. Ultrasonography does allow directed biopsies of the seminal vesicles or other suspect areas, and this may be helpful in staging the disease. The use of transrectal ultrasonography in prostate cancer has evolved rapidly, and changes in technology antiquate reports within a few years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Further investigations in this area are clearly indicated before we can recommend screening with prostate-specific antigen.\r"

Stage A1 carcinoma becomes clinically significant only in a distinct minority of patients, and even in this group, progression does not necessarily mean significant morbidity or death from prostate cancer. An aggressive approach is not justified. In contrast, stage A2 cancer is usually virulent, and aggressive therapy with curative intent is justified in patients of appropriate age and health. Both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation appear to provide long-term survival rates superior to those obtained with observation alone, but nearly 20% of these patients will die of cancer despite therapy. Unfortunately, forecasting the outcome in an individual case is still not possible, and efforts to identify prognostic features must continue. In the meantime, emotional arguments in favor of the treatment of all discovered cancers must be suppressed by an informed and objective understanding of the natural history of nonpalpable prostate cancer and the potential impact of treatment.\r"

Third, the patient's predicted life expectancy must be taken into account. Moreover, even clinically localized prostate cancer may have metastasized, and the need for surgical staging by lymph node dissection has been a significant factor in the authors' preference for radical retropubic rather than radical perineal prostatectomy. Neither of the two serum markers in clinical use is an absolute predictor of stage. Analysis of tumor ploidy may prove useful, and transrectal ultrasound warrants further study. In the elderly patient, the urologist certainly may elect to monitor the tumor without definitely deciding on operative versus conservative treatment.\r"

For patients with clinical stage B disease (nodular disease that did not exceed involvement of one lateral lobe), survival was only 5% less at 15 years than for the age-matched group of California men. This was in spite of the fact that the lymph node status and the true incidence of capsular penetration were unknown. Moreover, the patients were not stratified by histopathologic grade or by either acid phosphatase or prostate-specific antigen values. If one were to restrict the patients to those with intermediate and low Gleason scores, normal acid phosphatase, and low prostate-specific antigen values, it is likely that there would have been no difference between the survival of those with prostatic cancer and their age-matched peers. As one deviates from these conservative selection criteria and includes patients with more advanced stages, the likelihood of achieving 15-year survival diminishes. With radiation treatment, however, patients whose disease, by clinical examination, extends beyond the prostate and who seem too advanced for radical prostatectomy still may have a 20 per cent to 30 per cent chance of 15-year survival.\r"

  ".W": "Our results show that by using the nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy, potency can be preserved in the majority of appropriately selected patients without compromising the adequacy of tumor excision. However, proper patient selection is important. Patients with focal, well-differentiated tumors, especially young patients with stage A or B1 tumors, are ideal candidates. In patients with more extensive and less well-differentiated tumors, there is a higher risk of incomplete tumor excision. Although we suspect that the adequacy of tumor excision is determined more by the extent of the tumor than by the technique of radical prostatectomy used, we believe that nerve-sparing surgery should be used with great caution, if at all, in patients with extensive or high-grade tumors. In these patients, microscopic extracapsular tumor extension is extremely common, can be impossible to detect at the time of operation, and is less likely to be adequately encompassed by nerve-sparing techniques. On the other hand, our current data provide little evidence that excision of the neurovascular bundles is beneficial. It is possible that more extensive resections will not materially alter the incidence of positive margins or cure rates. Finally, it might be argued that all forms of radical prostatectomy are inappropriate for patients with poorly differentiated clinical stage B2 prostate cancer for whom there are no really effective treatment options. We continue to recommend radical prostatectomy for these patients based on the finding that patients with clinical stage B2 disease who have organ-confined tumors can be expected to have excellent long-term disease-free survival rates similar to those of clinical stage B1 patients. In the remaining patients who are clinically understaged, the prospects for the minimal microscopic tumor remaining being controlled with adjunctive radiation therapy may be better than those of controlling the bulky primary tumor with radiation therapy alone. This hypothesis will need to be tested in a randomized clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "This contribution summarizes the evidence from the natural history and pathology of this disease that, given the high incidence of latent cancer, a policy of radical treatment at diagnosis will represent over-treatment in the majority of cases. As yet, neither radical prostatectomy nor radical radiotherapy has been shown to be effective in managing the poorly differentiated tumor in the patient with \"localized\" disease. For the patient with well-differentiated disease, there is little evidence that early treatment is mandatory, because the majority of these patients will not die of prostatic cancer. The adoption of a policy of diagnosis followed by active surveillance would spare many patients the hazard and discomfort of a major operation or of a course of radiotherapy, would minimize expenditure, and would ensure that treatment was given only to those patients in whom progression had been demonstrated. Such an approach is almost certain to be as effective as treatment at diagnosis. Confirmation of this view is likely to be obtained from the existing studies of immediate versus delayed orchiectomy or LHRH therapy currently being undertaken by the Urological Working Party of the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom and the Urological Group of the EORTC within Europe.\r"

The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival.\r"

  ".U": "91020778\r", 
  ".W": "The evaluation of clinical stage C prostatic cancer has been enhanced by advances in staging modalities over the past 15 years. Better staging of the local lesion is possible with transrectal ultrasound-guided multiple biopsies of the prostate and its vicinity. Biopsies of suspect pelvic lymph nodes guided by CT (or lymphangiography) may obviate pelvic lymphadenectomy, particularly in patients with high-grade stage C lesions. Advances in the understanding of serum markers have supplemented other staging information. No single therapeutic modality is appropriate for all cases of clinical stage C cancer. In C1 lesions, radical prostatectomy with adjunctive radiation or hormonal therapy seems to produce the best 5- and 10-year survival rates. External-beam radiation alone, or in combination with interstitial radiation, may have equivalent success. In clinical stage C2 disease, external-beam radiotherapy seems at present to be the best therapeutic modality. Interstitial radiation as a sole method of management in stage C disease carries a high local recurrence rate and a significant risk of metastatic progression. Transurethral prostatectomy and hormonal treatment continue to have a place in the management of selected poor-risk patients. The current results with surgery or radiation therapy alone are less than ideal. It is recommended that aggressive combination treatment be compared with monotherapy in randomized clinical trials monitored jointly by radiation and urologic oncologists.\r"

  ".U": "91020779\r", 
  ".W": "Stage D1 disease will be encountered in 20 per cent of patients by those who treat prostate cancer. There is marked heterogeneity among cancers discovered at this stage, with 5-year disease-free survival rates ranging from 0 to 95 per cent. Generally, when prostate cancer has escaped the confines of the gland, metastasis occurs, and widespread systemic disease prevails. Any significant chance for long-term cure will then depend on systemic therapy. From maturing data in retrospective reviews, preliminary data from prospective trials, and recent well-conducted animal studies, chemotherapy and hormonal deprivation appear most effective when tumor volumes are the smallest. This evidence supports the removal of all cancer possible and the early institution of systemic treatment. Caution must be exercised in extrapolating the aforementioned evidence to include cases of more extensive prostate cancer (i.e., patients with bulky pelvic or retroperitoneal disease, distant metastasis, or significant elevation of serum markers). It is doubtful that \"debulking\" with removal of the prostate and lymph nodes will provide any justifiable advantages in these patients. Whether removal of the prostate affords any local palliative benefit is an issue for debate. Certainly, the primary tumor, if left untreated, will progress locally and cause symptoms necessitating further procedures in more than half these patients, whereas the incidence of local recurrence and the adverse effects of these recurrences in patients with D1 disease after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant therapy is less than 10 per cent. Surgical refinements coupled with acceptably low morbidity now associated with radical prostatectomy have led some authors to endorse the palliative benefits of removing the primary tumor in selected patients. The purpose of this article is not to endorse or disparage the aggressive treatment of patients with stage D1 prostate cancer. The evidence suggests that if long-term survival is the endpoint used to compare treatment groups, then to date no treatment option offers significant advantages. On the contrary, if progression rates or disease-free survival are compared, then cytoreductive surgery and early systemic adjuvant treatment (testosterone deprivation or chemotherapy) provides significant advantages for selected patients with stage D1 disease. Although ploidy analysis, receptor mapping, and oncogene assays are promising, today, there is no practical way to identify patients who will benefit most from multimodality treatment approaches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In spite of all that has been written about the varicocele, it is still not clear who will benefit from occlusion of the spermatic vein or why improvement in semen takes place in some patients but not in others. Because fertility is usually assessed in the framework of a couple who are trying to establish a pregnancy, it is important to evaluate both partners before making any recommendations regarding therapy. If the man is found to have a varicocele and semen analyses that indicate deficits in either the quantity or quality of the sperm, surgical ligation or transvenous occlusion should be considered as one appropriate form of therapy. Varicocele ligation and embolotherapy both can be performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal morbidity and equal effectiveness regarding pregnancy outcome. The cost, if the procedures are done in an outpatient facility, should be approximately equal. The obvious benefits of the percutaneous technique are a slightly lower recurrence rate and a more rapid return to full physical activity. The surgical procedure described by Marmar and associates appears to have a similar rate of recurrence and short postoperative period of recovery. Greater experience by more urologists using this technique needs to be gained to compare it adequately with the other methods described. Varicocele ligation by the inguinal or retroperitoneal routes is familiar to most urologists and does not require the operating microscope or other special instruments. With greater understanding of the venous anatomy and with careful dissection, the persistence and recurrence rate can be acceptably low and the postoperative recovery relatively rapid and smooth.\r"

Increased cystometric bladder capacity and disappearance of uninhibited detrusor contractions were noticed in a significant number of cases after treatment. No side effects were recorded.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineate the extent of ureteral carcinomas with a high degree of accuracy by depicting the periureteral fat and presence or absence of lymphadenopathy. In selected cases, CT and MRI are valuable for assessing the presence or absence of tumor in a ureteral stump and for the differential diagnosis of ureteral obstruction. Five cases of ureteral carcinoma and 2 cases of stump carcinoma are presented with preoperative CT and/or MRI evaluation and staging.\r"

In boys under ten years of age (prepubertal), testicular development was minimal, and the operated on and contralateral testes were not significantly different. With the onset of puberty, both testes enlarged, and no significant differences were observed. However, by age fourteen the side operated on was significantly (p less than 0.05) less well developed than the contralateral testis. No difference was detected clinically between the operated on and contralateral testes when the contralateral testis was less than 10 mL in volume. When the contralateral testis was greater than 15 mL, however, a significant difference was detected both statistically (p less than 0.05) and clinically. The findings suggest limited prospects for the development of testes that are operated on at puberty.\r"

Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis.\r"

  ".W": "Anorexia nervosa is notoriously difficult to treat, but little is known regarding the relationship of compliance to treatment outcome. We investigated in 41 adolescents who fulfilled DSM-III-R criteria for anorexia nervosa, the relationship between the completion of a standard psychosocial treatment program, subtypes of anorexia nervosa, and outcome as determined by standardized measurements. These adolescents were observed for an average of 32.4 months. Overall, 29 patients (70%) improved considerably, but 10 (24%) were symptomatic, and 2 (5%) remained in poor condition. There were no deaths. Of the 41 patients, 14 (34%) completed our entire treatment program, 15 (37%) received major treatment and failed in the outpatient follow-up phase only, 7 (17%) dropped out of inpatient treatment before its completion, and 5 (12%) refused treatment in our system altogether. Of all the dropouts, 10 received no further treatment. One patient was admitted to hospital elsewhere but again dropped out in the outpatient phase of that program. Seven patients (17%) received further outpatient treatment only, and 9 (22%) received inpatient and outpatient care and seemingly completed their treatment. Treatment completion significantly affected the measures of global clinical functioning and specific psychopathologic features, but only for those patients who completed the initial program. Bulimic patients did considerably worse on follow-up and were less likely to complete treatment. Patients with restricted anorexia nervosa were more likely to complete treatment than those with a bulimic subtype (P = .03). Differential compliance rates in the two subtypes confound the effects of treatment completion and need to be controlled for in future studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We reviewed recent Indian Health Service inpatient and ambulatory care data and compared these data with previous reports. Of the estimated Navajo population aged 45 years or older, 4,331 (16.9%) had an ambulatory care visit for diabetes between October 1, 1986, and September 30, 1987. Diabetes was coded for 1,041 (7.0%) of hospital admissions of persons aged 20 and older. Of 377 lower-extremity amputations done from 1978 to 1987, diabetes was involved in 245 (66%). The 1986 age-adjusted mortality rate from diabetes was 30.3 per 100,000, approximately twice that for the general US population. The explanation for the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Navajos probably relates to an increasing prevalence of obesity.\r"

Two patients had had ischemic strokes 5 months and 18 years, respectively, before transplantation. Six patients (7%) suffered acute neurologic events perioperatively. Three patients suffered cerebral infarctions. In 1 case this occurred 10 days before transplantation--probably as a result of systemic hypoperfusion--with the placement of ventricular assist devices. Two others suffered infarctions 5 and 21 days, respectively, after transplantation, each of probable embolic origin. Two patients had an acute intracerebral hemorrhage 21 and 36 days, respectively, after transplantation; both were located within the basal ganglia and subcortical regions. Both patients had moderate to severe hypertension, and in 1, renal failure and a coagulopathy developed before hemorrhage. Tremor, seizures, and an altered level of consciousness developed in 1 patient as an apparent toxic reaction to cyclosporine treatment. Only 1 patient died as a result of the neurologic complication--of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Three patients recovered fully, 2 partially. Only the case of drug toxicity could be directly attributed to the transplantation procedure itself. We conclude that the risk of an acute neurologic insult with orthotopic cardiac transplantation is low but may result from drug toxicity, cerebral ischemia, or hemorrhagic mechanisms.\r"

Of those patients with a blood alcohol level done, 32% had a level higher than 100 mg per dl.

Outbreak investigation has expanded our understanding of reservoirs for Giardia lamblia and of the routes of transmission. Various host factors have been associated with infection. The pathogenesis of giardial infections is being elucidated, in particular the role of lectin activation in producing disease. Three standard chemotherapeutic agents are available in the United States. The institution of community-wide prevention measures is equally important. Current areas of investigation including antigenic composition and enzymatic variants should result in effective forms of immunotherapy, while more effective forms of chemoprophylaxis could assist in eradicating the pathogen from institutional settings.\r"

While they are formed, act, and are inactivated locally and rarely circulate in plasma, they can affect blood flow in some tissues and so might contribute to the control of peripheral vascular resistance. Few studies have shown any derangement of total body prostaglandin synthesis or metabolism in hypertension, but increased renal synthesis of one prostanoid, thromboxane A2, has been noted in spontaneously hypertensive rats and some hypertensive humans. This potent vasoconstrictor may account for the increased renal vascular resistance and suppressed plasma renin activity seen in many patients with hypertension. Increased renal vascular resistance could increase the blood pressure directly as a component of total peripheral resistance or indirectly by increasing glomerular filtration fraction and tubular sodium reabsorption. Specific thromboxane synthesis inhibitors not only decrease renal thromboxane production but also increase renal vasodilator prostaglandin synthesis when prostaglandin synthesis is stimulated. This redirection of renal prostaglandin synthesis toward prostacyclin might be of benefit in correcting a fundamental renal defect in patients with hypertension.\r"

There seems to be no longitudinal epidemiologic validation of the attractive hypothesis that transiently elevated blood pressures are the prelude to fixed hypertension, however. The acquisition of hypertension by populations abandoning their traditional mode of living has been attributed to the sociocultural stress inherent in westernization, but these studies usually have not taken into account concomitants of this type of acculturation, such as dietary changes and increased body weight. The inverse relationship of blood pressure levels to education could explain the development of hypertension when aspiration to upward mobility is thwarted. The severity of perceived occupational stress relates inversely to blood pressure, suggesting that familiarity with a job renders the demands made by the work environment more predictable and less threatening in terms of vasopressor response.\r"

The prevention of allograft rejection and the suppression of autoimmunity generally require treatment with corticosteroids or cytotoxic drugs, or both, which may not be sufficiently effective and which frequently cause serious immediate and long-term complications. With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, it has become possible to identify and selectively inhibit distinct elements in the immune system that contribute to pathologic immune responses. This achievement has led to new therapeutic strategies that may be safer and more effective than the immunosuppressive therapies currently available. Many of these strategies focus on subsets of T cells because of the critical importance of T cells in immune responses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 + T cells, T-cell activation antigens, and T-cell receptor families have all shown promise in animal models and, in some cases, in preliminary human trials. The challenge now is to translate this promise into practical new forms of immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the \"eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome\" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis.\r"

In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess.\r"

Of all physicians responding, 40% reported that they were not recommending the Copper T 380A to anyone, the single most common reason given being concern about medical liability. A lack of knowledge about the new device, a lack of intrauterine device insertion skills, and certain medical practice settings were also important barriers to prescribing it. The new intrauterine device is considered in the context of innovation-diffusion theory. Substantial amounts of education and training and improvement in the medical-legal climate are needed before current barriers to prescribing the new device are removed.\r"

Cases that involved unanticipated treatments were reviewed to determine whether they could have been prospectively identified by simple clinical findings. Standard therapies were used in the majority of patients. Unanticipated therapies were administered to 13 patients, all of whom had abnormal vital signs, diaphoresis, respiratory distress, or a second prominent symptom. Data suggest that protocols could replace radio contact for most patients and that the few who might benefit from radio contact can be easily identified. A 90% reduction in radio contacts in Los Angeles county could save $3 million each year.\r"

  ".U": "91021249\r", 
  ".W": "Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that occurs with high prevalence in populations of European origin. The gene that is abnormal in hemochromatosis is found on the short arm of chromosome 6 in close proximity (approximately 1 centimorgan) to HLA-A, but the product coded for by that gene is unknown. The pathogenetic mechanism in hemochromatosis is that of continued, excessive absorption of dietary iron with loss of normal control mechanisms, leading to a gradual but vast expansion of storage iron as ferritin and especially as hemosiderin. Through mechanisms that probably include peroxidation of lipid membranes, the excess iron injures hepatocytes, islet B cells, gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary, myocardium, synovial cells, and chondrocytes, and probably other cells and tissues as well. Most patients with hemochromatosis remain undiagnosed throughout life. Removal of the excess iron by phlebotomy will prevent all of the complications of hemochromatosis when begun early and will significantly improve survival in virtually all patients. It is important, therefore, that the diagnosis of hemochromatosis be considered much more frequently in clinical medicine in order that this effective therapy be utilized.\r"
