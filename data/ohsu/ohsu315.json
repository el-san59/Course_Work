  ".W": "Cl self-exchange by the rabbit cortical collecting tubule (CCT) occurs via an apical anion exchanger in series with a basolateral Cl conductance. We studied the effects of organic acids on CCT Cl self-exchange. We found no evidence for transport of acid anions by the self-exchange system. Rather, Cl self-exchange was inhibited by a variety of organic acids. The degree of inhibition correlated with the chloroform/water partition coefficient and was enhanced by lowering pH, indicating inhibition by the lipid-soluble, protonated species. Inhibition by the representative acid iso-butyrate was dose-dependent and showed sidedness (basolateral greater than apical). Iso-butyrate also reversibly reduced transepithelial conductance without altering K permeability, suggesting inhibition of the principal cell basolateral Cl conductance. Because small organic compounds with similar lipid solubilities but no carboxyl group had no effect, both the carboxyl group and the lipid-solubility of organic acids appear to be important. The results are consistent with blockade of chloride channels by organic acids.\r"

Fixation of penicilloyl groups was studied in seven patients given large amounts of penicillin. Penicilloyl groups were found essentially on the albumin molecule at sites not accessible to anti-penicilloyl antibodies, except after pronase digestion. The amount of penicilloyl groups was proportional to the cumulated doses of penicillin. The decline of penicilloyl groups with time after treatment interruption was exponential. The half-life of penicilloylated albumin was lower than or equal to that of normal albumin. The presence of anti-penicilloyl antibodies was demonstrated in 19 out of 34 penicillin-treated patients (including the seven mentioned above). The relative scarcity of penicillin allergy as compared with the frequent occurrence of anti-penicilloyl antibodies may be partly related to unavailable sites of penicilloyl groups within the albumin molecule.\r"

  ".U": "88273607\r", 
  ".W": "The nonionic detergent, Pluronic L-81 (L-81) has been shown to block the transport of intestinal mucosal triacylglycerol (TG) in chylomicrons. This results in large lipid masses within the enterocyte that are greater in diameter than chylomicrons. On removal of L-81, mucosal TG is rapidly mobilized and appears in the lymph. We questioned whether the blocked TG requires partial or complete hydrolysis before its transport. Rats were infused intraduodenally with [3H]glyceryl, [14C]oleoyl trioleate (TO) and 0.5 mg L-81/h for 8 h, followed by 120 mumol/h linoleate for 18 h. Mesenteric lymph was collected and analyzed for TG content and radioactivity. An HPLC method was developed to separate TG on the basis of its acyl group species. The assumed acyl group composition was confirmed by gas liquid chromatography analysis. TG lymphatic output was low for the first 8 h but increased to 52 mumol/h at the 11th h of infusion (3 h after stopping L-81). 38% of the infused TO was retained in the mucosa after the 8-h infusion. 95% of mucosal TG was TO, 92% of the radioactivity was in TG, and 2.4% of the 14C disintegrations per minute was in fatty acid. HPLC analysis of lymph at 6, 10, 12, and 14.5 h of infusion showed a progressive rise in TG composed of one linoleate and two oleates, to 39%; and in TG composed of two linoleates and one oleate to 20% at 14.5 h of infusion. On a mass basis, however, 80% of the TG acyl groups were oleate. 3H/14C ratios in the various TG acyl group species reflected the decrease in oleate. We conclude that first, unlike liver, most mucosal TG is not hydrolyzed before transport. The mechanism of how the large lipid masses present in mucosal cells after L-81 infusion are converted to the much smaller chylomicrons is unknown. Second, the concomitant infusion of linoleate did not impair lymph TG delivery after L-81 blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between contractile function, myocardial oxygen consumption, and tissue high energy phosphate and lactate content were investigated during partial coronary flow disruption. The experimental preparation was an isolated, isovolumic retrograde blood-perfused rabbit heart. Both developed pressure (r = 0.94) and dp/dt (r = 0.95) exhibited strong linear correlations with myocardial oxygen consumption that were stable for up to 45 min after blood flow reduction. In contrast, tissue high energy phosphate content exhibited nonlinear relationships with both developed pressure and oxygen consumption such that systolic mechanical function and oxidative metabolism declined to 20 and 30% of control values, respectively, before significant abnormalities in myocardial high energy phosphate stores were observed. Similarly, developed pressure and oxygen consumption decreased to 36 and 48% of control, respectively, before abnormal tissue lactate content was detected. The results of this study indicate that: (a) mechanical function is closely related to the rate of oxidative energy production during partial coronary flow disruption, and (b) despite the development of significant contractile dysfunction, tissue high energy phosphate content remains at normal levels except under the most severely flow-deprived conditions. The preservation of tissue energy stores can be explained by the apparent coupling of contractile performance to oxidative energy production, which could function to maintain myocardial energy balance during partial coronary flow restriction.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction reduces early mortality, but full recovery of left ventricular function after reperfusion is delayed. Therefore, the relations among reperfusion, survival and the time course of left ventricular functional recovery were examined in 226 patients treated with intracoronary streptokinase; 77% (134 patients) had sustained reperfusion and 31 patients had no reperfusion or had reocclusion by day 3. Wall motion was measured from contrast ventriculograms performed in the acute period and 3 days later in the central and peripheral infarct regions and the noninfarct region by the centerline method in 165 patients. Patients with reperfusion had better survival (p less than 0.05, mean follow-up 4.5 years) and a higher ejection fraction at 3 days (52 +/- 12 versus 46 +/- 10%, p less than 0.02) attributable to a significantly different change in peripheral infarct region function between the acute and 3 day studies (0.1 +/- 1.0 versus -0.3 +/- 0.9 SD, p less than 0.05). These early functional changes were significant in patients with anterior myocardial infarction and showed similar trends in those with inferior myocardial infarction. On Cox regression analysis, function measured at 3 days was more predictive of survival than was function measured acutely (chi square for acute ejection fraction = 11.48 versus 24.59 at 3 days). Although, as previously reported, greater than 45% of total recovery of left ventricular function occurs later, the ejection fraction achieved by day 3 is already predictive of survival. Thus, the mechanism by which successful thrombolytic therapy enhances survival is improvement of regional and global left ventricular function early after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the interrelation of clinical and procedural factors responsible for restenosis, 119 patients undergoing coronary arteriography were studied a mean of 5.8 +/- 3 months after successful multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In all clinical, angiographic and procedural variables, the 119 patients undergoing repeat catheterization were similar to the 87 patients that did not. Overall, restenosis occurred in 74 (34%) of 215 lesions. Sixty-three patients had no restenosis, 44 had at least one restenosis and 12 had restenosis at all angioplasty sites. The statistical distribution of restenoses did not follow a binomial model, suggesting that restenosis is more than a lesion-specific phenomenon. Of all the clinical and procedural variables assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, only percent stenosis before angioplasty (p less than 0.01), diabetes mellitus (p less than 0.01) and percent stenosis after angioplasty (p less than 0.05) were predictive of restenosis in the entire group. Patients with no restenosis and patients with restenosis at all sites were not different with respect to procedural variables; however, patients with restenosis at all sites more often (p less than 0.05) had diabetes and recent onset angina. In contrast, patients with no restenosis differed from patients with isolated restenosis with respect to procedural variables: severity of stenosis before and after angioplasty, balloon/artery lumen ratio and maximal inflation pressure. Thus, procedural factors may be more related to isolated restenosis, but patient-related factors such as diabetes and recent onset angina may play a more important role in patients with multiple restenoses.\r"

Measurements of the stenotic segments were expressed as minimal luminal diameter, and the adjacent nonstenotic segments were expressed as interpolated reference diameter (both in millimeters). A follow-up rate of 86% was achieved. In the patients followed up at 30 and 60 days, there was no significant change in either the mean minimal luminal diameter or the mean reference diameter. However, at 90 and 120 days, there was significant deterioration in both the mean minimal luminal diameter (-0.37 and -0.42 mm, respectively) and the mean reference diameter (-0.17 and -0.26 mm, respectively), all of the changes being highly significant (p less than 0.00001). The reference diameter is involved in the dilation process and may be subject to the same restenosis process that takes place in initially stenotic segments. Percent diameter stenosis measurements, which are conventionally used to express the change in the severity of a stenosis after angioplasty, will tend to underestimate the change when there is a simultaneous reduction in the reference diameter.\r"

In 65 patients with multivessel disease, only the \"culprit\" lesion was dilated. The initial success rate was 89.5% (179 of 200 patients). At least one major procedure-related complication occurred in 21 patients (10.5%): (death in 1, myocardial infarction in 16 and urgent surgery in 18). All patients were followed up for 2 years. Five patients died late; 8 had a late nonfatal myocardial infarction and 52 had recurrence of angina pectoris. The restenosis rate was 32% (51 of 158) in the patients with initial successful angioplasty who had repeat angiography. At the 2 year follow-up, after attempted coronary angioplasty in all 200 patients, the total incidence rate of death was 3% (one procedure related; five late deaths), of nonfatal myocardial infarction 12% (16 procedure related and 8 late after angioplasty), and 13% (26 patients) were still symptomatic although they had improved in functional class. Multivariate analysis showed that variables indicating an increased risk 1) for major procedure-related complications were: ST segment elevation, persistent negative T wave and stenosis greater than or equal to 65% (odds ratio 3.7, 3.7 and 3.3, respectively); 2) for angiographic restenosis were: presence of collateral vessels, ST segment depression, multivessel disease, left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and history of recent onset of symptoms (odds ratio: 2.2, 2.0, 1.9, 1.9 and 0.54, respectively); and 3) for late coronary events (recurrence of angina, late myocardial infarction or late death) were: multivessel disease, total occluded vessel and ST segment elevation (odds ratio 3.7, 2.8 and 0.44, respectively). Thus, coronary angioplasty for unstable angina can be performed with a high initial success rate, but at an increased risk of major complications. The prognosis is favorable after initial successful coronary angioplasty.\r"

Left ventriculograms indicated a marked dyskinesia of the anterior and apical wall in all patients. After balloon inflation, there was a marked depression in stroke index and ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and the time constants of relaxation in all patients. Simultaneous recording of left ventricular pressure (Millar micromanometer) during cineangiography permitted the assessment of myocardial and chamber stiffness. Although there was a strong tendency for both myocardial and chamber stiffness to increase after 30 to 50 s of occlusion, these increases were statistically insignificant. In Group B, a third set of angiographic and pressure measurements obtained 15 min after completion of the coronary angioplasty procedure indicated no residual left ventricular dysfunction, and in this respect, the results are of added clinical importance.\r"

A pulpal test was carried out in all patients using an electrical dental stimulator commonly used in dentistry. Electrical current was delivered in increasing intensity from 10 to 500 mA, and the dental pain threshold and the reaction of the patients to maximal stimulation were determined. During the pulpal test, 71.2% of the patients in Group I did not experience pain, even at maximal stimulation (threshold 0), 11.5% were sensitive at threshold I (10 to 200 mA) and 17.3% felt pain at threshold II (210 to 500 mA). In Group II, 69.7% of the patients complained of dental pain at the low intensity test current (threshold I), 10.7% at threshold II and 19.6% at threshold 0. In Group I, 71.2% of patients did not have discomfort (reaction -), even at maximal stimulation, 21.1% had a mild reaction (reaction +) and 7.7% had an intense painful reaction (reaction ++).

The pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the appearance of this symptom, however, are unknown. Accordingly, hemodynamic, metabolic and ventilatory responses to 6 min of light isometric forearm exercise were examined and compared in 20 patients with chronic heart failure and abnormal ejection fraction (24 +/- 9%) and 17 normal individuals. In contrast to findings in normal volunteers, exercise cardiac index did not increase whereas exercising forearm and mixed venous lactate concentrations increased (p less than 0.05) above levels at rest in patients with heart failure; at 90 s of recovery, blood lactate concentration remained elevated (p less than 0.05). The venous lactate concentration of the nonexercising arm, unlike that of the exercising forearm, was not altered. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production and minute ventilation increased similarly in patients and normal subjects during exercise, but only in patients did each increase further (p less than 0.05) during recovery. Thus, in patients with heart failure, light isometric forearm exercise represents an anaerobic contraction with lactate production. The subsequent increase in carbon dioxide production leads to a disproportionate increase in minute ventilation and oxygen uptake during recovery that may be perceived as breathlessness.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the extent of left ventricular dysfunction and the degree of shape distortion can predict outcome in survivors of moderate-sized anterior Q wave myocardial infarction who are undergoing exercise training, these variables were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography before and after 12 weeks of a low level exercise training program starting 15 weeks after infarction in 13 patients (7 in group 1 and 6 in group 2) and 12 weeks apart in 24 matched control patients without training. By the end of training, the functional class score had increased in group 2 (from 2.25 to 2.67, p less than 0.005) but had not changed in group 1. Further discrimination of groups 1 and 2 was provided by an initial asynergy (akinesia or dyskinesia, or both) less than 18% or greater than or equal to 18%. Compared with group 1, group 2 had greater initial asynergy (32 versus 6%, p less than 0.001), expansion index (asynergic/normal endocardial segment length: 1.8 versus 1.6, p less than 0.025) and peak shape distortion index (12.2 versus 1.0 mm, p less than 0.005) but lower ejection fraction (43 versus 59%, p less than 0.05) and thinning ratio (asynergic/normal wall thickness: 0.61 versus 0.74, p less than 0.05). These variables did not change with training in group 1. However, in group 2, training caused significant increase in asynergy (from 32 to 40%, p less than 0.05), expansion index (from 1.8 to 2.0, p less than 0.01) and peak shape distortion (from 12.2 to 20.9 mm, p less than 0.05) associated with a decrease in thinning ratio (from 0.61 to 0.51, p less than 0.001) and ejection fraction (from 43 to 30%, p less than 0.005). Initial values for these variables were similar for corresponding control groups but did not change over the 12 weeks. Thus, patients with greater than or equal to 18% left ventricular asynergy on the initial echocardiogram showed more shape distortion, expansion and thinning before exercise training and developed further functional and topographic deterioration with training.\r"

Twenty-five patients (14 men, 11 women) who had a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and a mean age (+/- SD) of 38 +/- 14 years underwent electrophysiologic testing. Twenty-four of these patients had no evidence of coronary disease, whereas one patient had undergone previous coronary bypass surgery. Nineteen patients had orthodromic and six patients had atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardias. A 12 lead electrocardiogram and simultaneous femoral artery and coronary sinus blood samples for lactate determinations were obtained at baseline and at 5 and 10 min of supraventricular tachycardia. Mean baseline heart rate of 83 +/- 12 beats/min increased to 180 +/- 25 beats/min during supraventricular tachycardia. All patients had 1 to 8 mm of ST segment depression in 1 to 9 of the 12 leads. Chest pain occurred in 64% of patients during supraventricular tachycardia. Baseline myocardial lactate extraction was 28 +/- 13% with no significant change at 5 or 10 min of tachycardia. In contrast, in a comparison group of seven patients with known coronary artery disease, atrial pacing at 168 +/- 26 beats/min in five patients resulted in greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression in 2 to 7 of the 12 leads and a change in lactate extraction from a baseline of 29 +/- 13% to -27 +/- 20% (p less than 0.05) indicating net myocardial lactate production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether pharmacologically induced elevations in the plasma epinephrine concentration within reported physiologic limits alter the response to quinidine during electropharmacologic testing. Twenty-one patients with coronary artery disease and a history of unimorphic ventricular tachycardia were found to have inducible sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia that was suppressed by treatment with oral quinidine gluconate. Epinephrine was then infused at a rate of either 25 or 50 ng/kg per min and testing was repeated. These infusion rates of epinephrine were previously demonstrated to result in elevations of the plasma epinephrine concentration in the range of concentrations that occur during a variety of stresses. Quinidine significantly lengthened the ventricular refractory periods and the QRS duration at a ventricular pacing cycle length of 350 ms, which was used as an index of intraventricular conduction. Epinephrine partially or completely reversed the effects of quinidine on ventricular refractory periods, but had no effect on QRS duration. During electropharmacologic testing of quinidine, no ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 12 patients, and only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 8 to 48 beats in duration, was inducible in 9 patients. Retesting during infusion of epinephrine demonstrated inducible sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 of the 12 patients in whom quinidine had completely suppressed the induction of ventricular tachycardia and in 8 of the 9 patients in whom only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had been inducible during testing of quinidine. In conclusion, physiologic elevations in the plasma epinephrine concentration may reverse quinidine-induced prolongation of ventricular refractoriness but not intraventricular conduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A recent study in 1 day old infarcted canine cardiac tissue demonstrated that variations in entrance and exit characteristics of depolarized spontaneous foci could profoundly affect their expression, resulting in behaviors such as modulated parasystole and entrainment, second and third degree exit block \"autoentrainment\" and annihilation (abrupt termination) of spontaneous activity. Foci with exit and entrance delay should also allow the occurrence of reflected reentry. To test this, the left circumflex coronary artery was ligated and, after 1 day, simultaneous microelectrode impalements were made in infarcted and uninfarcted portions of isolated ventricular preparations. Preparations were stimulated from the uninfarcted portions. Reflected reentry was demonstrated in 5 of 11 preparations. It occurred when exit conduction delay resulted in reexcitation of the focus or, alternatively, when entrance conduction delay resulted in reexcitation of extrafocal tissue. Reflection occurred in which the action potentials were reexcited during phase 2 or 3, resulting in prolongation of action potential duration (type I), and in which reexcitation occurred after full or nearly full repolarization, resulting in a closely coupled extrasystole (type II). Electrotonic modulation and reflection could coexist, the type of behavior depending on the phase relation between focal and extra-focal action potentials. An example is illustrated in which type I reflection occurred only when preceding driven activity induced overdrive suppression of exit conduction from the focus. The results suggest that, in infarcted tissue, entrance and exit conduction delays to depolarized foci may form the basis for the occurrence of reflected reentry.\r"

Viral titers on day 10 of infection were 10(2.6 +/- 0.2) median tissue culture infective dose for the metoprolol group versus 10(2.1 +/- 0.1) for the saline group (p less than 0.05).

After intravenous infusion of contrast agent, multilevel tomographic images of the left ventricle (apex to base) were acquired at a rate of 17 frames/s. Analysis of these studies demonstrated substantial but predictable heterogeneity in left ventricular contraction from apex to base. In dogs and humans, for example, the average tomographic ejection fraction of the most basal level of the left ventricle was 40% less than that of the most apical level (p less than 0.05). In humans, circumferential segmental cavity contraction at the mid-papillary muscle level was relatively homogeneous (range 50 to 92% for 12 wedge-shaped segments around the tomographic circumference) if the reference system employed an endocardial centroid, but was less uniform if it used an epicardial centroid (range 22 to 98%). It is concluded that contraction of the normal left ventricle in dogs and humans is heterogeneous both between levels (apex to base) and within a single level (circumferential cavity contraction). However, the patterns of cavity contraction from apex to base and circumferential segmental cavity contraction within a given level as defined by ultrafast computed tomography are sufficiently narrow and predictable in normal individuals that these variables may be useful to define regional contraction abnormalities in pathologic conditions.\r"

The effect of sudden changes in hemodynamics on the mitral flow velocity pattern was also investigated in a subgroup of patients who had simultaneous recording of mitral flow velocity and left ventricular pressure before and after left ventriculography. Mitral flow velocity recordings from 30 healthy adults served as a reference group. This analysis suggests that 1) the majority of patients with these cardiac disorders demonstrate abnormal mitral flow velocity patterns or variables; 2) markedly different flow velocity patterns can be seen in patients with impaired left ventricular relaxation; 3) the different mitral patterns appear to relate more to myocardial function and hemodynamic status than to the type of disease process present; 4) certain mitral patterns suggest different filling pressures and rates of early diastolic left ventricular filling; 5) an increase in left atrial pressure can \"normalize\" an abnormal mitral flow velocity pattern and \"mask\" a left ventricular relaxation abnormality; and 6) the different patterns appear to represent a dynamic continuum with the potential to change from one to another as a result of disease progression, medical therapy or sudden changes in hemodynamics. It is concluded that, despite the indirect method of estimation and certain limitations, mitral flow velocity recordings have clinical potential in assessing left ventricular diastolic function that merits further investigation.\r"

An aliasing correction algorithm was used to extend the upper limit of measurable velocity to 184 cm/s. Images were analyzed for jet area (equal to the total number of image pixels) and jet energy (equal to the sum of all pixel velocities squared), both integrated over all frames of the injection and in single maximal frames. The Doppler flow mapping area and energy measurements were compared with known flow volume and delivered kinetic energy, and the effects of four experimental variables (orifice area, gain setting, chamber compliance and chamber size) were evaluated. Jet area correlated nonlinearly with flow volume and was markedly affected by each of these experimental variables, increasing by 40 to 150% from the smallest to the largest orifice size, 15 to 94% with the highest versus the lowest gain setting, 1 to 54% with greater chamber compliance and 7 to 70% in the large versus the small chamber. In contrast, jet energy correlated linearly with delivered kinetic energy up to 350,000 ergs, at which point velocities started to exceed the extended velocity range and second wrap aliasing occurred. The relation was not affected by orifice area, gain or compliance, and was only minimally affected by chamber size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study demonstrates that electrohydraulic shock waves generated by a hand-held lithotriptor fragmented the calcifications contained within the cusps of four necropsy specimens of stenotic aortic valves. The electrohydraulic shock waves appeared to create a cleavage plane between the valve tissue and the fragmented calcific deposits, allowing the fragmented calcified masses to be removed without cusp perforation. Five patients with severe aortic stenosis also underwent successful aortic valve decalcification augmented by electrohydraulic shock waves generated with the hand-held lithotriptor, without significant complication. The shock waves permitted removal, from the aortic valve, of calcium that had not been removed by mechanical means. These results indicate that the addition of electrohydraulic shock waves to mechanical aortic valve decalcification may facilitate successful decalcification in patients undergoing operative treatment for aortic stenosis and may allow patients to avoid the need for aortic valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "In 26 consecutive cases with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) the main cardiac findings were Kaposi's sarcoma in 2 cases, microfocal myocardial abscess in 1, subendocardial infarct necrosis in 2, contraction band necrosis in 13, lymphocytic myocarditis in 9, intramyocardial lymphocytic infiltrates without myocell necrosis in 7 and epicardial lymphocytic infiltrates in 4. No patient had congestive heart failure. However, two-dimensional echocardiography performed in eight patients demonstrated functional abnormalities in six (fractional shortening ranging from 18 to 30%, globular shape, hypokinesia, mild ventricular dilation). Four of these six patients had lymphocytic myocarditis and two had lymphocytic infiltrates in the myocardium and epicardium without myocell necrosis. No lymphocytic infiltrates were seen in the two cases with a normal echocardiogram. Quantitative analysis indicated that involvement of the heart by lymphocytic myocarditis is inadequate in itself to explain dysfunction. It remains to be established 1) whether lymphocytic myocarditis is a possible indication of a more widespread molecular disorder, and 2) what its eventual relation with dilated cardiomyopathy will be.\r"

In 11 children pulmonary vascular resistance was greater than 4.6 U/m2 (mean 8.6 +/- 1.6), whereas in 10 it was less than 4.5 U/m2 (mean 3.4 +/- 0.2). Although both groups demonstrated acceleration time and AcT/RVET values above normal, there were no significant differences in these values between the groups with high and low pulmonary vascular resistance. With administration of a pulmonary vasodilator pulmonary vascular resistance decreased in 11 responders by greater than 50% of baseline values (from 5.3 +/- 0.7 to 1.6 +/- 0.3 U/m2), whereas in the 10 nonresponders mean pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 7.0 +/- 1.9 to 4.9 +/- 1.1 U/m2. There was no significant change in the Doppler indexes except for an increase in pulmonary artery peak velocity in the responders from 1.34 +/- 0.07 to 1.66 +/- 0.06 m/s (p less than 0.001). The results indicate that Doppler echocardiography cannot predict either the level of increased pulmonary vascular resistance or the degree of responsiveness sufficiently to obviate the need for cardiac catheterization in patients with interventricular communication and pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Results of relief of pulmonary stenosis were graded by catheter gradient in the catheterization laboratory and compared with Doppler echocardiographic findings at follow-up. There were 32 patients with typical pulmonary stenosis and 4 with a dysplastic valve. In the 32 patients with typical pulmonary stenosis, transvalvular gradient changed from a mean of 67 +/- 32 to 20 +/- 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001, mean reduction 72.6%). The gradients at follow-up by Doppler echocardiography averaged 20 mm Hg including 15 that increased, 3 that were unchanged and 14 that decreased. Only 3 (9%) of 32 patients had a gradient greater than 25 mm Hg at follow-up and only one gradient was greater than 35 mm Hg. All four patients with a dysplastic valve had a gradient that decreased with valvuloplasty from a mean of 85 +/- 33 to 33 +/- 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); gradient reduction in this group ranged from 40 to 85% (mean 57.5%). The gradient at follow-up increased in three of these four patients and decreased in one (the only late gradient less than 25 mm Hg). Late gradient was less than 35 mm Hg in two of the four patients and was reduced by 43 and 57%, respectively, in the other two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 16 children (aged 3 months to 17 years) the single balloon technique was utilized; the ratio of balloon diameter to valve anulus diameter was 0.96 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SEM). In 11 children (aged 3 months to 21 years) the double balloon technique was utilized in which two balloons are positioned across the valve and inflated simultaneously; the ratio of the balloon diameter sum to valve anulus diameter was 1.32 +/- 0.05. The groups were similar in age, weight, cardiac output, prevalvuloplasty gradient and valve anulus diameter. Overall, valvuloplasty reduced the peak systolic gradient by 53% from 80 +/- 4 to 38 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001).

The peak systolic gradient after valvuloplasty was 43% lower in the double balloon group (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, the single balloon technique reduced the gradient by an average of 43% compared with a 67% reduction with the double balloon technique (p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is an unusual cardiac malformation with discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial alignments. Because knowledge of the coronary artery anatomy is a prerequisite for successful repair of this cardiac anomaly, selective coronary arteriography was performed in 13 children (4 male and 9 female; age range 18 months to 16 years) and 1 adult (aged 59 years) with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and associated intracardiac defects. The typical coronary distribution of corrected transposition (that is, coronary artery-ventricular concordance) was found in 11 patients. In one patient, a single coronary ostium was observed; the right sinus of Valsalva gave rise to a short common branch that divided into three arteries: a left circumflex artery going to the right, a well developed left anterior descending artery running into the anterior interventricular groove and a third vessel that continued on the normal course of the right coronary artery directed posteriorly. In one patient, the left circumflex artery was particularly small. In another patient, with severe hypoplasia of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the anterior ventricular wall of the heart was supplied by three small branches that ended a short distance from their origins. The adult patient had a large anterior ventricular branch arising from the morphologic left coronary ventricular as well as a large acute marginal branch, with a wide distribution, from the morphologic right coronary artery. Presurgical coronary angiographic documentation is helpful because, in congenitally corrected transposition as well as in complex congenital heart disease, coronary anomalies (in origin, course and distribution) are occasionally present and knowledge of their presence can help determine the most appropriate surgical approach.\r"

In 20 patients (aged 8.75 +/- 10 years) with congenital aortic stenosis (measured peak left ventricular pressure 120 to 260 mm Hg; transvalvular gradient 18 to 165 mm Hg), transaortic valve continuous wave Doppler ultrasound, indirect carotid pulse tracing, peripheral blood pressure and measured left ventricular pressure were recorded simultaneously at cardiac catheterization. Data were entered into a microcomputer using a digitizing tablet and the instantaneous Doppler gradient was calculated and added to instantaneous aortic pressure, derived from the time-corrected and calibrated carotid pulse tracing, to estimate instantaneous left ventricular pressure. Estimated left ventricular pressure waveforms reproduced measured left ventricular pressure closely. The mean error at peak left ventricular pressure was 0.2 +/- 4.8 mm Hg (r = 0.98, p = 0.001). The average error throughout ejection was 0.9 +/- 5.1 mm Hg. The error of estimated pressure was not related to age or the severity of aortic stenosis. The Doppler peak instantaneous gradient was observed to correlate closely (r = 0.97, p = 0.001) with peak to peak gradient. With this technique, the left ventricular pressure waveform throughout ejection can be accurately estimated noninvasively in patients with aortic stenosis. This methodology enables determination of mean, total and instantaneous systolic left ventricular pressure.\r"

  ".U": "88273917\r", 
  ".W": "Although long-term therapy with oral beta-adrenoceptor agonists in patients with heart failure is generally associated with the development of diminished pharmacologic efficacy, the ingestion of levodopa, which is decarboxylated endogenously to dopamine, is associated with a sustained improvement in cardiac function. The beneficial hemodynamic actions of dopamine in patients with heart failure have been attributed to a positive inotropic effect that is mediated through activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors. However, a reduction in left ventricular afterload resulting from the activation of dopamine receptors may also lead to an improvement in the performance of the failing heart. To ascertain the relative importance of the positive inotropic and afterload-reducing effects of dopamine in patients with heart failure, dopamine (2, 4, 6 micrograms/kg per min), dobutamine (2, 6, 10 micrograms/kg per min) and nitroprusside (0.125 to 2.0 micrograms/kg per min) were administered to 13 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy while monitoring left ventricular wall thickness and dimensions by echocardiography and left ventricular and aortic pressures with a micromanometer-tipped catheter. Altering left ventricular afterload, quantified as end-systolic circumferential wall stress, with nitroprusside allowed generation of the left ventricular end-systolic circumferential wall stress-velocity of fiber shortening relation that represented the baseline contractile state of the myocardium. Left ventricular velocity of fiber shortening was elevated during the administration of dobutamine and dopamine when compared with measurements obtained with nitroprusside at the same left ventricular end-systolic circumferential wall stress. Furthermore, left ventricular end-systolic wall stress decreased with dopamine but not with dobutamine. Thus, the beta 1-adrenoceptor activity of dopamine and dobutamine augmented the contractile state of the myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A new technique of internal transcatheter cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation using high energy shocks (200 to 300 joules) was performed in 10 patients. In all patients, external cardioversion (300 to 400 joules) and pharmacologic therapy failed to restore sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation was poorly tolerated despite digitalis therapy alone (five patients) or in combination with amiodarone (five patients). High energy transcatheter cardioversion was performed by pulling back the atrioventricular (AV) junction catheter just inferior to the site of His bundle recording and delivering the shock between a proximal electrode (catheter) and backplate (anode). High energy internal cardioversion restored sinus rhythm in 9 of the 10 patients. However, atrial fibrillation recurred within 3 min in two of them; in the remaining patient, the procedure failed to terminate atrial fibrillation. The only complication observed was transient (3 to 315 s) heart block immediately after shock delivery and this was treated by temporary pacing. Seven patients had sinus rhythm on discharge from the hospital, but in three, recurrent atrial fibrillation appeared at 8 days and 2 and 4 months, respectively. A second attempt of transcatheter cardioversion was performed in two patients and was successful in one patient. With a follow-up ranging from 2 to 11 months, five patients continued to have sinus rhythm. These preliminary results suggest that high energy internal cardioversion may be an alternative to AV junction ablation in selected patients with poorly tolerated chronic atrial fibrillation in whom external cardioversion was unsuccessful.\r"

The new H1-receptor antagonist, cetirizine 2 HCl, orally administered with 10 mg once a day to pollen-sensitive patients in a double-blind, crossover study versus placebo, induced a significant decrease in the wheal-and-flare cutaneous reaction induced by intradermal injection of pollen, histamine, and compound 48/80. It also significantly inhibited the immediate histamine release occurring in skin chambers after pollen introduction, whereas it did not significantly inhibit the late release. In patients receiving placebo, we detected platelet-activating factor-acether in media collected at the sixth hour from chambers filled with pollen. With cetirizine 2 HCl treatment, platelet-activating factor-acether was not detected in chamber media. Interestingly, cetirizine 2 HCl significantly reduced the eosinophil recruitment observed on the superficial dermis 24 hours after pollen challenge.\r"

Sera from 51 ragweed-allergic patients undergoing allergen immunotherapy were evaluated for ragweed-specific IgG antibodies with the same ragweed extract in the two assay systems. With optimal conditions, the ELISA and SPRIA displayed comparable positive thresholds (approximately 1 ng/ml of ragweed-specific IgG). Both assays also demonstrated consistently parallel dilution curves with 51 sera (mean interdilutional coefficient of variation [CV] less than 8.8% for ELISA and less than 8.6% for SPRIA). Reproducibility was determined by constructing precision profiles for intra- and interassay variations over the working ranges of each assay (ELISA, 0.8 to 100 ng/ml; SPRIA, 1 to 250 ng/ml). ELISA intra-assay CVs ranged from 13% near threshold to less than 5% at higher antibody concentrations; SPRIA intra-assay CVs ranged from 4.3% to 2.8%. Interassay reproducibility was somewhat better for SPRIA (4.6% to 9.6%) than for ELISA (10% to 18%). In direct comparison, 41 (80%) of the 51 sera were concordant in the two assays (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001). Although each assay result was reproducible, 10 (20%) of the sera elicited consistently discrepant results in the two assays. In eight of the 10 discordant sera, the SPRIA results were higher than ELISA, suggesting the possibility that some ragweed allergen may be better represented on the short ragweed-pollen extract agarose than on ELISA plate wells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, lymphocytes from five of six hypersensitive patients were not stimulated by carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide, and oxcarbazepine (OXC), and this was confirmed clinically in two CBZ hypersensitive patients with OXC therapy. The results indicate that OXC may be suitable as an alternative therapy in some patients with CBZ hypersensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Anticholinergic aerosols provide effective bronchodilation in some patients with obstructive lung disease. Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium anticholinergic compound that is poorly absorbed from mucus membranes, thus reducing anticholinergic side effects. In 20 adult patients with asthma, we evaluated bronchodilation to a single administration of metered-dose glycopyrrolate aerosol (GA) to ascertain its onset and duration of action along with evaluation of safety. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, crossover trial, bronchodilation was evaluated on five separate occasions to either placebo or a GA dose of 80, 240, 480, or 960 micrograms. Baseline spirometry for each patient on each visit was similar (mean FEV1 +/- SD of 62.2 +/- 13.6% predicted). After aerosol dosing, spirometry was measured at 30 minutes and then at hourly intervals up to 12 hours. Compared to placebo, metered-dose aerosols of 240, 480 and 960 micrograms elicited significantly greater bronchodilation at each test time. Furthermore, significant bronchodilation was noted within 30 minutes of dosing and was sustained for at least 12 hours. Bronchodilation with the 480 and 960 micrograms dose was equal, and both were greater than 240 micrograms. A subset of four asthma patients with baseline FEV1 values less than 50% predicted did not have a bronchodilating response with GA. No notable side effects occurred. Thus, a single aerosol dose of GA provides clinically significant, safe 12-hour bronchodilation in patients with asthma without severe airway obstruction (i.e., FEV1 greater than 50% predicted).\r"

  ".W": "Based on density, function, and membrane receptors, peripheral blood eosinophils are a heterogeneous population of cells. Importantly, hypodense eosinophils (HE) are metabolically more active and likely to contribute to tissue injury. In the following study, peripheral blood from patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) was evaluated for the presence of HE. To accomplish this, blood was obtained from patients with ragweed AR, granulocytes were isolated and fractionated by continuous density Percoll gradients, and the density distribution of these cells was determined after centrifugation. A significantly higher percentage of peripheral blood eosinophils were hypodense (defined as density less than 1.081 gm/ml) in patients with AR when these patients were compared to control subjects, 30.0 +/- 5.0% versus 9.0 +/- 1.9%, p less than 0.01. Moreover, we also noted that an increased percentage of HE was found more often in patients with moderate-to-severe AR than in subjects with none-to-mild disease (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that the appearance of HE in the circulation may relate to the development of allergic symptoms. Furthermore, our observations suggest that the HE, because of its enhanced metabolic activity and now its association with more symptomatic hay fever, may participate in the pathophysiology of AR.\r"

In a full workday the level was 0.4 mg/m3. In 60 workers, symptoms of rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis were frequently reported, mostly by heavily exposed workers (69%). Five workers (14%) with PA-associated asthma were found. All were heavily exposed during some period. There was no difference between the exposure groups with regard to total serum level of IgE, IgG, and IgM, nor specific IgE and IgM against PA. There was a significant difference of specific IgG against PA between heavy and low exposure groups (p = 0.01). One worker with asthma had an increased specific IgE level. Subjects with symptoms did not differ from subjects without symptoms in total serum IgE, IgM, IgA, or specific IgE and IgM. However, subjects with rhinoconjunctivitis had lower total IgG than the other workers (p = 0.01). The subjects with asthma had significantly higher values for specific IgG than the asymptomatic subjects (p = 0.005). Four subjects had specific IgG antibodies of subclass 4 (IgG4). Three of these four subjects had asthma, and one had rhinitis. These findings demonstrate that specific IgG is an index of PA exposure and support the hypothesis that specific IgG4 under some circumstances, may be a pathogenetic factor in asthma.\r"

It is not apparent why this seasonal variation occurs nor whether the variation in morbidity and mortality is associated with variation in bronchial reactivity. We have measured bronchial reactivity on four occasions during 12 months in 60 subjects selected from a community population in the south of England. All subjects had had a histamine challenge test and skin tests to common antigens as part of a survey of asthma prevalence in March 1984. Further measurements of the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) were made at the peak of the grass-pollen season in June, at the end of September, and in the following March, and current symptoms of respiratory tract infection (RTI) were assessed on all four occasions. Geometric mean PD20 demonstrated significant seasonal variation between 1.38, 0.82, 0.92, and 1.20 mumol in March, June, September, and March, respectively (p less than 0.02). Relative to March 1984, PD20 was significantly decreased in June and September (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively) but not in March 1985 (p = 0.39). Within subjects atopy was significantly related to decrease in PD20 in September (p less than 0.05) and in March 1985 (p less than 0.025) but not in June (p = 0.40). Change in PD20 between occasions was unrelated to RTI symptoms, age, or smoking status, but it was related to change in baseline FEV1/FVC (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 56 2-week periods during which symptoms were absent, peak flow was decreased in 30 (54%), FEV1 in 20 (36%), and FEF 25-75 in 37 periods (66%). Peak flow readings were normal in 13 of 70 periods (16%) in which FEV1 was decreased, and in 33 of 113 periods (29%), in which FEF 25-75 was decreased. Of 25 periods in which symptoms were absent and peak flow was normal, 19 (76%) were associated with decreased FEF 25-75. The results confirm previous studies that indicate peak flow readings are a useful addition to symptom diaries. More importantly, they demonstrate that airway obstruction may be present in a large proportion of asymptomatic children with asthma who have normal peak flow rates and suggest that frequent assessment of FEF 25-75 is required, as well as daily monitoring of symptoms and peak flow both in trials of drug therapy and for more optimal assessment of the effectiveness of therapy in clinical practice.\r"

Direct intracutaneous tests to PA-MSA, PA-EtOH-sal, MSA, and EtOH-sal were applied at biweekly intervals throughout the course of the immunization. Serum-specific IgG to PA-MSA and specific IgE to PA-MSA were determined at 2-week intervals according to the ELISA and RAST methods, respectively. The prevalence of cutaneous sensitivity to PA-MSA in the PA-MSA-immunized group (group 1) was significantly greater after 4 and 6 (p less than 0.01) and 8 and 10 (p less than 0.05) weeks, compared with the other treatment groups. Significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) PA-MSA-specific IgG was also observed in monkeys in group 1 compared with the other treatment groups. No significant changes in PA-MSA RAST or total IgE were observed in any group during the study. These results indicate that parenteral sensitization to PA in subhuman primates requires the presence of new antigenic determinants formed by PA on protein carriers.\r"

Diluted serum is applied to the plastic reagent strip, which is then inserted into a reflectance photometer that quantitates the color change and displays the serum concentration in 80 seconds. To determine the reliability of this method, control sera (5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, and 25.0 micrograms/ml of theophylline) and 78 specimens, each from a different patient, were analyzed by Seralyzer and a reference method (EMIT, Syva Co., Palo Alto, Calif.). Nine replicate measurements of a 15.0 micrograms/ml control serum were performed on one day, an all five control sera were analyzed once daily for 20 days. Patient specimens were analyzed at the rate of eight per day. The coefficient of variation (mean/SD X 100) for within day precision of the 15 micrograms/ml control was 5.2% for Seralyzer and 4.1% for EMIT (p less than 0.05). Coefficients of variation for between-day precision of the Seralyzer were less than 10% at concentrations greater than 5 micrograms/ml, but were significantly greater than EMIT measurements at 5 and 10 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05). There was a strong correlation between the two methods for the 78 patients' specimens (r2 = 0.95). The Seralyzer demonstrated a positive bias of 0.9 microgram/ml. Results analyzed by the two methods differed by greater than 25% in 10 of the 78 specimens (mean error, 3.3 micrograms/ml over the range of 2.9 to 22.2 micrograms/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bound IgE is digested by pepsin and then titrated by its agglutinating activity on 0.8 micron Lx particles coated with antihuman Fc epsilon rabbit F(ab')2. This latex allergosorbent test detects 100 pg of specific IgE per milliliter and does not depend on the concentration of total IgE. Owing to a tenfold increase in the allergosorbent surface, no competition with the binding of specific anti-D. pteronyssinus IgG is observed. Pepsin digestion eliminates potential interferences caused by autoantibodies against IgE. A good correlation (r = 0.92) is found with Phadebas RAST on a series of 91 samples. The latex allergosorbent test does not make use of radioisotopes and can be performed in less than 6 hours.\r"

In the presence of Ipr, 10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/L, the functional antagonism between ACh and F was partially reversed. Concentration response-curves to F versus ACh, 2 X 10(-3) mol/L, were shifted to the left, and although the -log molar concentration producing 50% of maximal effect was not significantly modified, the maximal effect of F was significantly increased in the presence of Ipr, 10(-8) mol/L.

Airborne particulates were collected on fiberglass filter sheets with an Accu-Vol sampler located 1.5 m above ground on the southeastern Minnesota prairie. Filter eluates analyzed by RIA inhibition contained concentrations of moth protein peaking in June and August to September of each year, with levels comparable to reported immunochemically measured levels of pollen and mold allergens. These peaks also corresponded with total numbers of moths captured in light traps. Moth-allergen activity was distributed in particle sizes ranging from 0.8 to greater than 4.1 micron when sized samples were obtained by use of an Andersen cascade impaction head. By RIA inhibition, there was cross-reactivity between P. unipuncta and insects of different genera, families, and orders, but not with pollens or molds. Forty-five percent of 257 patients with immediate positive skin tests to common aeroallergens had positive skin tests to one or more commercially available whole body insect extracts. Of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis believed to be primarily caused by ragweed sensitivity, 5% also had elevated specific IgE to moths. We conclude that airborne concentrations of Lepidoptera can be measured immunochemically and that moths may be a seasonal allergen in the United States.\r"

Eighty-three subjects with asthma were evaluated during a 7 1/2-month panel study of air pollution effects. Although 44 (53%) of the NCs developed a malfunction during the study, the average total (+/- SD) percentage of useful days with functioning NCs was still 86 +/- 18% (median 93%). The agreement between the daily diary and NC recordings was very high, that is, 50 (67%) of 75 subjects had perfect agreement. Eighteen subjects with over or under diary reporting were detected. We conclude that the NC is an effective, objective, accurate, and continuous monitor of daily MDI usage despite some remediable technical problems. The NC can facilitate the evaluation of short- and long-term medication usage patterns and compliance issues in MDI-related research and clinical settings.\r"

Castor bean-specific IgE antibodies, measured by RAST, were found in 87 (91%) of the castor bean-allergic patients, in two of 13 atopic Marseilles residents living close to the castor bean mills, in three of 42 allergic subjects who had no known contact with castor bean, and in none of a control group of 111 Marseilles blood donors. Very high levels of castor bean-specific IgE (maximum class 4 readings on the Phadebas RAST score) were found in 54 (56%) of the castor bean-allergic patients, but the level of IgE antibody to castor bean was not significantly different in atopic and nonatopic subjects. The frequency of a positive serological test (RAST) for atopy in castor bean-allergic subjects (32%) was very similar to that found in the local population (36%). These data indicate that castor bean is an extremely potent sensitizer for both atopic and nonatopic individuals. The magnitude of the specific IgE antibody response is not related to the atopic status of the patient and may be a function of the physiochemical characteristics of the allergen itself.\r"

Specific IgE antibody to the 2S storage albumin, measured by RAST, was detected in most (96%) castor bean-sensitive patients, confirming it as the major allergen. We would like to suggest that the 2S albumin be named Ric c I, that the crystalloid proteins be named Ric c II, and that the 47/51 kd doublet be named allergen 3.\r"

  ".W": "Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is well recognized in its ability to colonize the respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, a number of the immune responses of the patient with CF to this organism have been characterized, and the immune inflammatory response to Af may result in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This study evaluated a series of immunologic parameters in 75 patients with CF in order to characterize more fully the spectrum of immune responses of those patients to Af and to clarify the relationship of those responses to the clinical features of ABPA. The patients could be classified into four groups, depending on the clinical and immunologic findings. Eight (10.7%) of the 75 patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of ABPA, including immediate cutaneous reactivity to Af, eosinophilia, elevated total serum IgE, elevated serum IgE-Af or IgG-Af, and precipitating antibody to Af. Ten (13.3%) patients had these features, except that the total serum IgE level was within the normal range. Forty (53.5%) of the patients had no significant criteria for ABPA but had varying immunologic responses to Af, such as immediate cutaneous reactivity to Af in 25 patients and elevated serum IgE-Af and/or IgG-Af in 19 patients. Seventeen (22.7%) patients had no evidence of an immunologic response, as determined by skin testing and serologic assays. The study demonstrated that the response of patients with CF to Af ranges from clinically apparent ABPA to a possible variant of ABPA, to a nondiagnostic group of features consistent with sensitization to Af or to no characteristic immune response.\r"

From the response to the ATS-DLD-78-C respiratory symptoms questionnaire, 14 subjects (3.1%) were found to have asthma syndrome (recurrent episodes of attacks of shortness of breath with wheezing) and 17 subjects (3.7%), wheezing syndrome (only wheezing). The percentage of the asthma syndrome increased with increasing levels of Df-specific IgE, and there was an intimate correlation between the percentage of asthma syndrome and Df-specific IgE levels (r = 0.97; p less than 0.001), whereas such association was not found between the two (r = -0.19; p greater than 0.5). Similar relations were found between the frequencies of the specific syndromes and total IgE levels. There was a significant correlation between total IgE levels and Df-specific IgE levels in the total population (r = 0.7; p less than 0.001). These results suggest that allergic reaction greatly contributes to the development of asthma in children.\r"

From the first to the second period, the frequency of disseminated disease decreased from 50.5% to 22.9%, whereas the frequency of skin, eye, and mouth (SEM) diseases increased from 17.9% to 43.4% (P less than .001). The frequency of infants with central nervous system (CNS) disease remained relatively unchanged--31.6% versus 33.7%. We also compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of the infants and their mothers. For neonates with CNS or disseminated infection, disease duration and frequency of prematurity were significantly decreased in the second period, as was the frequency of skin vesicles for newborns with SEM or disseminated infection. These changes are most likely the consequence of recognizing and treating SEM infection before its progression to more-severe disease.\r"

After immunization, one subject developed mild zoster caused by wild-type virus. Twelve adults developed a mild breakthrough case of chickenpox after exposure to VZV. Protection after household exposure was observed in nine (56%) of 16; however, the illness in all seven patients with breakthrough illness was modified, with an average of only 24 vesicles. Subjects seropositive at household exposure were unlikely to develop a breakthrough illness. Approximately 25% of vaccinees who seroconverted lost detectable antibodies to VZV after vaccination, but even those who became seronegative were partially protected. Varicella vaccine offered significant protection against severe chickenpox in healthy adults.\r"

The only positive marker for the presence of HDV was serum HDV RNA; HDV antigen was undetectable in both serum and the liver by an immunoblot assay and immunofluorescence, respectively. Because the detected amount of viral genome was very low, the previous failure to identify the chronic HDV carrier state in the chimpanzee can be attributed to the lower sensitivity of previously described assays.\r"

Both vaccines induced neutralizing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG to the whole virus, IgG antibody to VP1 and VP3, and similar secretory IgA to VP1 and VP2 in the nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) without any VP3 response. Virus-specific neutralizing activity in NPS was observed in 70% of subjects receiving OPV and in only 26.7% of subjects receiving IPV. ELISA antibody also appeared to be lower in IPV than in OPV subjects. These observations suggest that specific ELISA antibody to poliovirus virion proteins can be frequently induced in the secretory sites, by OPV as well as by IPV. Neutralizing antibody response in the NPS appeared, however, to be more effectively induced by OPV than by the high-potency IPV.\r"

Rhinoscopy detected more mucosal bleeding sites in high-dose (38%) versus low-dose (12.5%) or placebo (12.5%) recipients. There were more subepithelial lymphocytes in nasal biopsy specimens in the high-dose (54%) than the low-dose (17%) or placebo (17%) groups. In the efficacy study, 34 volunteers received daily nasal drops of IFN, beginning 36 h before challenge and for three days afterwards. The numbers of infections and days of shedding of virus were not reduced, but colds occurred less often in the high-dose (25%) than in the low-dose (55%) or placebo (64%) recipients. Nasal mucus weights were lower in the high-dose (mean +/- SD g per five days; 5 +/- 4) than placebo (31 +/- 37) recipients.

In a rabbit model of meningitis, the lysis-defective strain remained cryptic, with a delay of 5 h in the onset of leukocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid. A marked burst of leukocytosis was associated with ampicillin-induced lysis of a lysis-sensitive strain but not of a lysis-defective strain. Pneumococcal clinical isolates have different lytic responses to penicillin; defective lysis may adversely affect the course of meningitis, an observation suggesting that autolysins play a role in modulating infectious diseases.\r"

These isolates closely resembled Mycobacterium fortuitum, except for a negative three-day arylsulfatase test; growth at 43-45 C; a low semiquantitative catalase test; and, in 50% of isolates, a late-developing, yellow-to-orange pigment. The isolates were biochemically identical to four reference strains and the type strain of M. smegmatis. Isolates were resistant to isoniazid and rifampin but susceptible to ethambutol, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and amikacin. Eleven patients treated on the basis of in vitro susceptibility tests responded well to therapy. The similarity of M. smegmatis to M. fortuitum and the failure to recognize that the former is an environmental species may have contributed to previous failures to recognize it as a human pathogen.\r"

Protection was greater for BS-WC recipients than for WC recipients only during the initial eight months of observation. Both vaccines conferred equivalent protection against cholera associated with life-threatening dehydration and against less severe cholera. High-grade, sustained protection was observed in persons vaccinated when older than five years; in younger persons protection was transient. We conclude that BS-WC and WC vaccines confer significant protection against cholera, particularly in persons vaccinated when older than five years.\r"

Equivalent tobramycin dosages were given: 5 mg/kg every 4 h or 30 mg/kg every 24 h. Animals were serially killed during therapy, and quantitative lung cultures were performed. Bacterial titers in lungs dropped rapidly in all tobramycin-treated animals, both neutropenic and nonneutropenic, during the initial 16 h of therapy. In nonneutropenic guinea pigs, lung titers remained constant despite continued 4-h dosing. With subsequent 24-h dosing, titers continued to drop, and by 72 h there were a significant number of animals with sterile lungs (P less than .01). In neutropenic guinea pigs given tobramycin every 24 h, bacterial regrowth occurred; thus, therapy was ineffective. Adding mezlocillin, however, suppressed regrowth; thus, combination therapy was superior (P less than .05).\r"

Neutropenia was sustained with intravenous Ara-C, and bacterial complications were prevented with parenteral ceftazidime plus ampicillin. Candidiasis was established by intravenously administering Candida albicans or Candida tropicalis (1-2 x 10(5) colony-forming units) and resulted in hepatic and splenic lesions that mimicked those associated with hepatosplenic candidiasis in humans. The kidney proved to be the site most refractory to eradication of Candida spp. and offered a target organ for assessing antifungal therapy. We evaluated amphotericin B, 5-flucytosine, ketoconazole, and rifampin, alone and in combination. Although each agent reduced the colony counts of Candida in the liver, spleen, and lung, the combination of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine was the only regimen effective in eradicating renal candidiasis.\r"

Sixty-seven mongrel newborn dogs (2 to 20 days old, 300 to 1500 gm) were divided into four groups: group 1 (2 to 20 days old, 300 to 1500 gm) received normal saline solution, group 2 (2 to 10 days old, 300 to 800 gm) received 1.5 mg/kg of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), group 3 (2 to 10 days old, 300 to 800 gm) received 10 mg/kg of LPS, and group 4 (11 to 20 days old, 801 to 1500 gm) received 10 mg/kg of LPS. Cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and minute work were measured serially after endotoxin administration for 4 hours. Despite extensive manipulation, these measurements were stable in controls throughout the length of the study. Endotoxin, administered at two different doses of 1.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, had profound effects on hemodynamic responses. These effects included a significant dose-related fall in cardiac output, minimal changes in heart rate, and a marked rise in systemic vascular resistance. The hemodynamic changes reported in this study lend additional support to the hypothesis that maturational factors are involved in the hemodynamic response to LPS.\r"

In both strains fed an atherogenic diet containing 27% coconut oil and 4.5% cholesterol, there was a significant rise in serum very low-density plus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but only C57BL/6J mice developed discernible fatty lesions in the aortic wall. In A/J mice a significant rise in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also observed, which corresponded to the appearance of a second species of high-density lipoprotein in the serum, but in C57BL/6J mice there was a fall. In susceptible C57BL/6J mice, free cholesterol is secreted into bile, which becomes supersaturated, leading to the formation of gallstones. In the resistant strain, however, dietary cholesterol accumulates in the liver. A difference in hepatic cholesterol metabolism between the two strains may thus be a factor in determining their different susceptibilities to diet-induced atherosclerosis.\r"

Additionally, we have investigated the possibility that determination of leukocyte recruitment, supplementary to peripheral blood leukocyte counts, might allow individuals with neutropenia at risk from serious infection to be distinguished with greater certainty. Varying doses of radiation, cyclophosphamide, and methylprednisolone were used to induce distinct levels of leukopenia in rats. Leukocyte recruitment was measured by quantifying the response of neutropenic animals to evocative, subcutaneous stimuli, and the results of this assay were then compared with circulating leukocyte counts in the same individuals. Six models of experimentally induced infection were used to compare circulating and recruitable leukocytes as indicators of the susceptibility of the leukopenic host to infection. Response curves relating leukocyte numbers to host resistance were similar when circulating or recruitable leukocytes were used as an index of defense capability. These findings support the use of peripheral blood leukocyte numbers as an index of resistance to infection in individuals with leukopenia and suggest that functional analyses such as leukocyte recruitment are unlikely to provide additional information.\r"

Because bowel healing is related to the adequacy of perfusion in other circumstances, we studied bowel surface oxygen tension (PSO2), which is related to bowel perfusion, in rabbits with IBD. Both cell-mediated (n = 17) and immune complex-mediated (n = 10) colitis caused marked attenuation of colon PSO2. Control (n = 13) left colon PSO2 was 36 +/- 5 (SEM) torr. In mild colitis, left colon PSO2 fell to 11 +/- 5 torr, and in severe colitis it fell to 4 +/- 1 torr (p less than 0.01 for each compared with control). These changes occurred irrespective of the mechanism of induction of colitis. Gastric and small intestinal PSO2 were unaffected. Hepatic and renal PSO2 were decreased in severe colitis only. The presence of decreased PSO2 was a better marker for the presence of IBD than was histologic evaluation. It is suggested that attenuation of PSO2 may be a marker for the physiologic activity of IBD. If this is so, PSO2 may prove a useful adjunct in the operative management of IBD.\r"

Therefore red cell lipids were labeled with serum albumin-bound (carbon 14 [ul]) fatty acids in timed experiments. Susceptibility of sequentially labeled lipids to peroxidation in intact cells was determined by the percent conversion of the [14C]lipid to [14C]malondialdehyde (MDA). Other effects of alteration of incubation times could be ruled out by the equality of the conversion of total cell lipid to MDA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids but not other fatty acids served as MDA precursors. In 12 normal subjects the percentage of [14C]arachidonate converted to MDA after 15 minutes of labeling (3.08% +/- 0.69%) exceeded the percentage after 3 hours of labeling (2.01% +/- 0.83%) (paired, two-sided t test, p less than 0.0001). This susceptibility was caused by presence of rapidly labeled polyunsaturated fatty acids not extractable with defatted albumin (F2). Depletion of erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate before incubation favored accumulation of F2 and increased percentage conversion to MDA. Peroxidative susceptibility is determined by the metabolic state of the cell and the site of the peroxidized lipid within the intracellular pools.\r"

In all, eight metabolites and four closely related structural analogues were studied. These included the desmethyl, 2'-oxo, 10,11-dihydroxy, N-oxide, N'-oxide, and diN,N'-oxide derivatives. When we used the cytotoxic chromium 51 release assay, the parent compounds were typically from 10 to greater than 300 times more effective than the corresponding metabolites and structural analogues in promoting antibody-mediated platelet lysis. Reaction patterns varied significantly among all antibodies and compounds studied, strengthening previous evidence that drug-dependent platelet antibodies are extremely heterogeneous in their reactions with platelets. Although most of the metabolites were much less potent than the parent compounds in promoting antibody-mediated platelet lysis, one quinidine-induced antibody was significantly inhibited in its quinidine-mediated lytic activity by the addition of desmethylquinidine, an essentially nonreactive metabolite with this particular antibody. These findings support the hypothesis that the native structures of quinine and quinidine are sufficient to provoke drug-dependent antibody formation and subsequent platelet destruction independently of their metabolites. They also suggest a possible protective role for some of these metabolites in certain individuals who are susceptible to this allergic drug reaction.\r"

The literature was reviewed in an effort to generate a list of constructs that would be relevant to physician work satisfaction. By using constructs that focus on both physician work satisfaction and capitation, a survey instrument was developed and serially administered to physicians involved directly in a capitation program. Among the five dimensions studied, providers rated capitation patients more favorably in only one area: interpersonal relationships. Providers indicated a preference for noncapitation patients in the dimensions of autonomy, intellectual stimulation, time restraints, and structural variables. Furthermore, physicians' satisfaction levels with capitation patients tended to decrease the longer they cared for them. These findings are consistent with expectations, and lend support to the hypothesis that organizational constraints may have an adverse effect on physician attitudes toward selected aspects of caring for capitation patients.\r"

The study was designed to look at reasons why physicians ordered STLDs and to what extent those results influenced subsequent theophylline prescribing. Findings showed that a large number of STLDs were ordered on asymptomatic patients with no recent dose change or initiation of therapy and no recent hospitalization or emergency room visit. The most common reason for ordering an STLD was presentation with symptoms or signs of asthma and no other recent events. On several occasions when low results were obtained, theophylline dosage was not increased. In some of these cases the patient's clinical presentation may have influenced the decision to maintain the same dosage. Use of erythromycin and smoking status were observed to affect theophylline clearance. Most physicians failed to document time of last theophylline dose, which hindered accurate interpretation of STLDs.\r"

Twenty schools in six school districts in the two-state area of Georgia and South Carolina participated in the study. A number of analyses indicated that the student heavy drinker was most typically male, white, and between the ages of 14 and 15 years with an above average knowledge about alcohol and liberal attitudes toward alcohol use. The adolescent heavy drinker is more likely to have parents and best friends who are heavy drinkers, to have had his first encounter with alcohol at an early age, to drink with friends his own age, and to feel that almost all of his friends drink. Results of this study can be used by family physicians in the management of potential alcohol abusers. Early recognition and intervention by the family physician may help to reduce the alarming number of adolescents who are struggling with problems related to alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "This study correlates the disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival (S) of 1,157 histologically node negative breast cancer patients with the estrogen and/or progesterone receptor (ER, PR) and with the nuclear or histologic grade (NG, HG) of their tumors. All were treated by operation without systemic adjuvant therapy. The DFS, DDFS, and S were significantly greater (P = .005, .004, less than .001) in patients with ER positive than ER negative tumors but the magnitude of the differences after 5 years of follow-up was slight (8% in both DFS and DDFS and 10% in S). Differences of that magnitude are insufficient to discriminate clearly between patients who should or should not receive systemic therapy. As with ER, there were outcome differences in favor of PR positive tumors but only in S was the difference significant (8% at 5 years; P = .002). When combined with ER, PR made no independent contribution in the outcome prediction. Regression analysis indicated that NG was the most important single marker of outcome. The prognosis of women with unknown ER or PR was equivalent to or better than that in those with ER or PR positive tumors. This finding seems to be related to tumor size in that a higher proportion of tumors with unknown receptors were less than 1.0 cm, thus having insufficient tissue for analysis. Our findings disclose that in node negative breast cancer patients, NG is a better marker of prognosis than is tumor ER, and that PR is of little or no value. Tumor NG may also be useful for selecting the type of systemic therapy to be used in these patients.\r"

B-cell lymphomas of intermediate- or high-grade histology constituted 78% of lesions. Stage of disease varied with histologic grade, with a preponderance of advanced disease (stages IIIE and IV) in patients with low-grade lymphoma (15 of 21) (71%), compared with higher grade lesions (38%, P = .01). Among patients with nonlocalized (stages IIE through IV) lymphoma of intermediate- or high-grade histology, surgical resection of the primary focus afforded a higher rate of complete remission (CR) (70% v 50%) and sustained CR (61% v 21%, P = .04) after cytotoxic therapy compared with the nonresected cohort. The median survival in the resected group was 51 months + compared with 13 months in the nonresected patients (P = .012). Differences in outcome were attributable to a high risk of treatment-related complications (perforation and/or hemorrhage) (43% v 0%, P = .001) and local relapse (29% v 4%, P = .05) in nonresected individuals. Life-threatening local complications were not observed in patients with low-grade lymphoma managed solely with medical therapy. Histologic findings from surgically staged patients identified presence of extravisceral disease and intermediate- or high-grade tumor histology as features predictive of transmural invasion, enabling potential identification of patients who might be optimally managed by resection of the primary GI focus before initiation of cytotoxic therapy.\r"

All patients had complete clearing of the skin after TSEB. However, while receiving chemotherapy, two patients developed visceral involvement and eight patients relapsed with limited cutaneous plaques (LCP). The median duration of remission was 12 months from the completion of TSEB, and all patients relapsed with cutaneous plaques within 25 months. Complete remission was again achieved using additional electron irradiation and maintenance therapy in all but one patient. Multiple cutaneous recurrences occurred in all patients. Median survival from the initiation of TSEB is 6 years. Five patients are living beyond 8 years (four off treatment without disease for 1 to 7 years). LN involvement did not influence initial response or survival. Combined modality therapy for tumor stage MF using TSEB followed by systemic CT and subsequent maintenance therapy may lead eventually to prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) in selected patients.\r"

Among eight patients with advanced solid tumors, dose-limiting toxicities were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. There were no clinically significant renal, neurologic, or otologic sequelae. Nausea and vomiting were mild and transient. Although the trial was not designed as a phase II assessment, we observed three objective regressions among three patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who had failed prior chemotherapy. The total CDDP dose is similar to five-day single agent studies, yet the total VP-16 dose is approximately 24% to 50% less than a five-day single agent VP-16 dose. The recommended regimen for continuous 120-hour infusion is VP-16, 30 mg/m2/24 h and CDDP, 20 mg/m2/24 h, repeated at monthly intervals.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment results for 36 patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma treated from 1942 through 1985 at the University of California, San Francisco, were reviewed. Twenty-two tumors were located in the posterior fossa, 10 were in the hypothalamic region, and four were in the cerebral hemispheres. Twenty-eight patients were less than 18 years of age. The overall survival rate was 83% and 70% at 10 and 20 years, respectively. All 12 patients who had total tumor resection remain disease-free; only two of the 12 received postoperative irradiation. The 10- and 20-year freedom-from-progression for the 19 patients who had incomplete resection and received at least 40 Gy of postoperative irradiation was 74% and 41%, respectively. All patients who failed treatment had local recurrence. One patient developed diffuse meningeal seeding, after four local recurrences in the posterior fossa over a 23-year period. Six patients failed treatment and had a repeat biopsy at the time of recurrence or at postmortem examination, and three showed histological progression of the tumor to an anaplastic astrocytoma. Based on this study and others in the literature, a protocol has been adopted whereby patients who have total tumor resection are not treated with postoperative irradiation. Patients who have incomplete tumor resection and are older than 3 years of age are currently treated with postoperative partial-brain irradiation, to a dose of 45 to 60 Gy. In general, young children with incomplete resection are followed closely with computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and are treated with chemotherapy or irradiation if tumor progression is documented.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality is a well-known entity in the pediatric age group. Age-related elasticity of the vertebral ligaments as well as immaturity of the osseous structures in the pediatric spine allow momentary subluxation in response to deforming forces. The resultant neurological injuries range from transient dorsal column dysfunction to complete cord transection. Between 1960 and 1985, 42 such injuries were treated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Management of these radiographically occult spinal cord injuries consisted of cervical immobilization for 2 months in a hard collar and restriction of contact sports. Recurrent cord injury occurred in eight cases during the 2-month immobilization period. A clearly defined traumatic episode was identified in seven of the eight patients, although in four children the recurrent trauma to the spine was trivial. Five of the children removed their collars briefly before the second injury, and two children incurred reinjury with the hard collar in place. The remaining child was too young for hard-collar immobilization, and recurrent neurological deterioration occurred during sleep. Serial flexion-extension films failed to detect frank instability in any of the eight cases. The children most susceptible to reinjury were those who sustained mild or transient neurological deficits from an initial cord injury and who rapidly resumed normal activities. Radiographically occult spinal instability resulting from the initial injury to the vertebral and paravertebral soft tissues presumably made these children vulnerable to recurrent spinal cord injury, often from otherwise insignificant trauma. During the last 21 months, 12 additional children have been managed with a more stringent protocol combining neck immobilization in a rigid cervical brace for 3 months and restriction of both contact and noncontact sports, together with a major emphasis on patient compliance. With this new protocol, no recurrent cord injuries have been documented.\r"

The mean duration of clinical history was 29 months, except for cases of meningioma of the posteromedial border, for which it was 5 years. Plain x-ray films and cerebral angiograms were obtained in all cases. Computerized tomography, performed in the last 20 cases (32.7%), supplied much better lesion topography and early diagnosis. The tumor site was posterolateral in 26 cases (42.6%), anterolateral in 14 (22.9%), posteromedial in eight (13.1%), at the free border in seven (11.4%), and in the tentorium itself in six (9.8%). Lateral and medial tumors with solely or mainly supratentorial development were approached from above. The approach from below was reserved for meningiomas with subtentorial involvement only. In meningiomas with both supra- and subtentorial growth, a supratentorial bone flap was combined with a suboccipital craniectomy using a retromastoid incision. The mortality rate was 9.8%. Of the remaining 42 patients, who were followed for at least 5 years, long-term results were good in 26 cases (61.9%), fair in 11 (26.2%), and poor in five (11.9%). Postoperative complications arose in 34% of the patients, but cleared in 27%.\r"

In 12 patients this was selected as the primary treatment due to the severe deterioration of vision or concern regarding the possible adverse effects of steroids; all 12 patients showed rapid and complete resolution of the disease, although eight patients still have a shunt in place. In 24 patients a shunt was inserted when other forms of treatment failed; all of these patients showed rapid resolution of the condition, although 20 patients still have a shunt in place. Three patients had the shunt removed without sequelae, and one patient in whom the shunt was removed because of low-pressure symptoms remains symptomatic with persistent papilledema (over 6 years). The percutaneous lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt was associated with the lowest revision and complication rates. Cisternal shunting to either the atrium or pleural cavity was next most effective, whereas valved LP shunts inserted via a laminectomy were least effective; ventricular shunts were used in only two cases. Shunting is therefore very effective in the treatment of BIH, but the significant complication rate and the possibility of inducing shunt dependence must be recognized.\r"

From June, 1986, through February, 1987, 42 patients with head injury were admitted to the Neurosurgical Service of the Seirei Mikatabara General Hospital. Cerebral contusion was suspected in six of these patients. Although the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans showed no cerebral parenchymal lesion, the initial symptoms were more serious than might have been expected from the initial CT findings and/or because their initial CT scans showed intracranial extracerebral hemorrhage. In all six, the initial CT scans were obtained within 2 hours after the injury and were followed by MR imaging. In four patients, T2-weighted MR images revealed areas of increased signal intensity in the cerebral parenchyma, where hemorrhagic changes were subsequently demonstrated by follow-up CT scans. In the remaining two, T2-weighted MR images showed no parenchymal lesion and subsequent CT scans confirmed the absence of hemorrhagic change; these two patients were discharged from the hospital without neurological deficits. It is concluded that MR imaging is useful in predicting delayed hemorrhages.\r"

Nifedipine was administered to treat arterial hypertension (greater than 180 mm Hg, systolic). Ten measurements were made in eight patients with cerebrovascular disease or head trauma. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and ICP were measured before and for 30 minutes after the administration of nifedipine. The MABP gradually decreased and reached its lowest value at approximately 10 minutes after initiation of nifedipine administration, and thereafter remained unchanged. The MABP decreased significantly from 128 +/- 8 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 109 +/- 7 mm Hg, and the CPP decreased from 105 +/- 11 to 84 +/- 10 mm Hg. The ICP increased by 1 to 10 mm Hg in eight of 10 measurements, and the mean change of ICP from 19 +/- 7 to 22 +/- 6 mm Hg was statistically significant. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in neurological signs. The results suggest that enteral nifedipine produces a small but statistically significant increase in ICP. Accordingly, neurological signs must be closely observed to detect deterioration, which can be caused by an increase in ICP and/or a decrease in CPP.\r"

When neural symptoms or findings do occur they may be related to stretching and traction mechanisms. This study of a symptomatic patient defined with reasonable clarity the abnormal anatomy, and some neurological symptom relief was achieved by attempting to alter the CSF dynamics. The relevant literature has been sampled to elucidate the condition.\r"

Extraluminal application of 10(-5) M oxyHb induced marked and long-lasting vasoconstriction in the internal carotid but not in the common carotid arteries. The 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction was potentiated significantly in both the internal and common carotid arteries. These potentiations were not influenced by the presence or absence of endothelium, a finding which was confirmed by vascular responses to intraluminal acetylcholine. It is concluded that the interaction between extraluminal oxyHb and intraluminal 5-HT may be one of the possible etiological factors behind the chronic phase of vascular spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "The materials ordinarily used to reconstruct bone defects in the calvaria and facial bones either are difficult to shape, are partially resorbed by the body, or are likely to become infected if used near a contaminated area such as the frontal sinus. Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (plaster of Paris) has been known for years to have excellent reparative qualities in bone defects, but ordinarily it is quickly resorbed. Consequently, a new material, a composite of a dense form of plaster of Paris and hydroxylapatite, was devised to provide nonabsorbable hydroxylapatite particles for bone to form around and within during the phase of plaster absorption. Two types of this material were evaluated in cranial defects in cats. Each of the plaster of Paris/hydroxylapatite mixtures was placed into a surgically unroofed frontal sinus and into a contralateral parietal trephine hole in a group of 32 cats. Two cats in each group succumbed to anesthesia, leaving two sets of 30 cats. During the entire follow-up period there was only one other death, with no evidence of wound infection, wound dehiscence, implant rejection, or cerebral dysfunction among the survivors. The cats in each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 months after operation. Following sacrifice, both the frontal and parietal defects were exposed and examined visually, histologically, and with histomorphometric analysis for new bone formation. New bone formation was present as early as 1 month after operation and continued to increase during the 12 months of the study. Based upon these osteogenic qualities, the ease of shaping the composite, and the lack of infection in the frontal sinus region, it is concluded that this substance could be a valuable new material for human cranioplasty.\r"

Specimens of spinal cord were viewed in transverse section and from the dorsal and ventral aspects by scanning electron microscopy. Transverse sections of spinal cord and meninges were also examined by light microscopy. The arachnoid mater was seen to be closely applied to the inner aspect of the dura. An intermediate fenestrated leptomeningeal layer was observed attached to the inner aspect of the arachnoid mater and was reflected ventrally to form a series of dorsal septa. As it arborized laterally over the surface of the cord to surround nerves and blood vessels, the intermediate layer became highly fenestrated but remained distinct from the pia and arachnoid mater. The pia mater appeared to form a continuous layer which was reflected off the surface of the cord to coat blood vessels within the subarachnoid space in a manner similar to that described in the leptomeninges over the human cerebral cortex. Each dentate ligament consisted of a collagenous core which was continuous with the subpial connective tissue and was attached at intervals to the dura; pia-arachnoid cells coated the surface of the dentate ligaments. The present study suggests that the fine anatomy of the human spinal meninges differs significantly from that described in other mammals.\r"

  ".W": "Castleman's disease is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder that usually arises in lymph nodes, most commonly in the mediastinum. The authors report the clinical and pathological features of three patients with localized Castleman's disease of the leptomeninges. There were two women, aged 63 and 82 years, and one 25-year-old man. Two patients had progressive focal motor seizures of 3 and 24 months' duration, and the third patient presented acutely with generalized seizures. The clinical diagnosis was meningioma in each case, based on computerized tomography scans, cerebral arteriography, and the operative findings. All three lesions arose in the leptomeninges, compressed the underlying cerebral cortex, and infiltrated the overlying dura to a variable extent. Surgical excision of the tumor resulted in marked clinical improvement in all three patients. Histologically, two cases were classified as the hyaline-vascular type and one as the plasma cell type. Immunohistochemical stains of the latter case revealed a monoclonal population of mature plasma cells. Only a few scattered polyclonal plasma cells were seen in the other two cases. The authors conclude that Castleman's disease involving the leptomeninges is a rare disorder that may mimic meningioma clinically and radiographically.\r"

Three patterns of platelet localization emerged as the best predictors of active DVT: (a) focal or (b) linear 4-hr localization, or (c) an asymmetric blood-pool pattern on 4-hr imaging that evolved into a focal or linear pattern by 16 to 24 hr. All false-positive studies had abnormal patterns confined to the inguinal region at 24 hr. All patients with false-negative studies had received heparin between 4 and 24 hr. The potential pitfalls encountered in the evaluation of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins are reviewed and the importance of delayed imaging in selected cases is emphasized.\r"

The index lesion/lesions were visualized in six of the seven other patients, except for 4/16 nodules in one patient. The seventh patient had a large, necrotic melanotic tumor that was not visualized, but an unsuspected lesion in the iliac nodes was detected. Multiple unsuspected lesions were detected in a second patient. While many lesions were seen at 2-4 hr, all lesions (other than a patient with small bowel disease) were seen best at 16-24 hr. No eye uptake was observed in any patient or control subject. Testicular uptake was seen in all males at 16-24 hr.

The half-time of blockade by naltrexone in the brain ranged from 72 to 108 hr which is greater than the fast plasma clearance components (4-12 hr) of naltrexone or its metabolite, beta-naltrexol, but corresponds well to the half-time of the terminal phase of plasma naltrexone clearance (96 hr). These results are consistent with the duration of the pharmacologic effects of naltrexone in response to heroin administration and indicate that 50 mg/day of oral naltrexone results in plasma levels in excess of that needed to saturate opiate receptors. This is the first example of the use of a simple dual-detector system with positron-emitting radioactive drugs to provide information regarding the duration of action of the drug on its specific receptor site. The plasma clearance half-time of a drug may not give an accurate reflection of the duration of action of the drug on a specific neuroreceptor site. Direct measurement of drug effects on recognition sites greatly extend current studies of pharmacokinetics.\r"

To investigate the methylated fatty acid that is best adapted for an assessment of uptake, we have studied the influence of the number and the position of the methyl groups of IFA intracellular metabolism; 16-iodo-2-methyl-hexadecanoic (mono-alpha), 16-iodo-2,2-methyl hexadecanoic (di-alpha), 16-iodo-3-methyl-hexadecanoic (mono-beta), and 16-iodo-3,3-methyl-hexadecanoic (di-beta) acids were injected into the coronary arteries of isolated rat hearts. Intracellular analysis shows that the degradation of mono-alpha was always lower than that of IHA and the storage was always much higher. The differences between mono-beta and IHA were similar to those observed with mono-alpha, but were much more pronounced. With the two dimethylated IFAs there was an inhibition of both oxidation and esterification which led to an accumulation of free FAs in myocardial cells. In conclusion, mono-beta, di-alpha, and di-beta are potentially suitable for studying the cellular uptake of IFA since all of them, and particularly the dimethylated IFAs, have a low oxidation rate.\r"

There were no significant differences in the average TB results of the 99mTc and 111In groups, either within or between the dual- and singly-labeled studies. The %R0 of singly-labeled [99mTc]WBC was about half that of the other groups (p less than 0.01); however, this difference was attributed to the dissimilar radiochemical purity of the [99mTc]HM-PAO reagents. Region of interest analysis of the 6 and 24 hr images revealed no significant differences between either cell label in the relative or absolute in vivo uptake at known sites of osteomyelitis, noninfected surgery, and normal bone marrow.\r"

Computed tomography showed bone formation proceeding for several weeks after the end of the distraction period, followed by a decrease in the amount of bone during a remodeling phase leading to the formation of a solid cortical structure. The uptake of [99mTc]MDP increased parallel to, but preceeding the actual accretion of bone, followed by a decrease during the bone remodeling phase.

These adverse reactions have been suggested to be secondary to MAA embolic occlusion of a significant portion of the remaining pulmonary circulation. The single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (SBDLCO) is heavily dependent on the status of the pulmonary microcirculation and is reduced in clinical pulmonary embolism. The effect of MAA particles on the lung microcirculation was measured by SBDLCO in 11 patients undergoing clinically indicated lung perfusion scanning. SBDLCO was measured before and immediately after injection of 256,000 to 448,000 20-40 micron particles of [99mTc]MAA. Mean SBDLCO prior to injection was 18.9 +/- 1.7 (s.e.m.) and immediately after injection was unchanged at 19.0 +/- 1.6 ml/min/mmHg. The lowest pre-injection SBDLCO values were 11.5 and 6.2 ml/min/mmHg (54% and 28% of predicted, respectively); in neither of these patients was there a detectable change in SBDLCO measured after injection of MAA. Thus occlusion of as many as 448,000 20-40 micron pulmonary vessels by MAA is without detectable impact on the transfer of carbon monoxide even in patients with sufficient pulmonary disease to lower the SBDLCO to 28% of predicted.\r"

We used a computer model to investigate the relative accuracy of forward gating (FG), backward gating (BG), and three methods of combined forward-backward gating (FBG). LV time-activity curves (TAC) were simulated with total cycle lengths randomly varied (1 s.d. = +/- 10%). To match the known differential effects of cycle-length variation on various parts of the cardiac cycle, 90% this variation was placed in diastasis and 10% in the rapid filling phase. Three hundred cycles of TACs were summed to form one \"study\". A total of 25 studies were performed and systolic and diastolic parameters were determined for each. These were compared to those of the mean length TAC. With a 20% cycle-length acceptance window, error in peak filling rate by FG was 0.7% root-mean-squared (RMS) compared to 18.5% RMS by BG. With a 5% window, RMS error by FG was 0.2% and 2.4% RMS by BG. Combined FBG algorithms gave intermediate results. We conclude that the simplest and most accurate method of analysis is to acquire forward gated TACs with appropriate cycle-length windows.\r"

  ".W": "For 2 mo rats were fed a salmon oil diet (12.5%, wt/wt) supplemented with 4.5% (wt/wt) corn oil, a corn oil diet (17%, wt/wt) or a low fat diet (4.4%, wt/wt). Cardiac lipids were analyzed and fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was determined. Ventricular biopsies were taken for ultramicroscopic examination. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid and vitamin E concentrations were significantly lower in rats fed salmon oil than in those fed the other two diets, whereas serum transaminases and vitamin A were not significantly affected. Cardiac protein, phospholipid, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were unaffected by diet. Cardiac phospholipid composition remained unchanged and no significant changes in lyso-PC or lyso-PE levels were observed. However, the salmon oil diet produced a markedly lower n-6/n-3 ratio in both PE and PC than in the other two diets. This was the result of replacement of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), primarily 20:4n-6 with n-3 PUFA, primarily 22:6n-3. The unsaturation index of PC and PE was higher with the salmon oil diet than with the other two diets. Ventricular biopsies of rats fed salmon oil showed mild lipid accumulation associated with some lipofuscin-like material. It is suggested that, in rat heart, fish oil led to a moderate accumulation of lipids, the composition of which may include long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and a degradative form of peroxidized lipids.\r"

  ".W": "To test the response to increased utilization of methyl groups, we administered large dosages of nicotinamide to rats fed an adequate diet that contained limited amounts of methionine and choline. During the 4 d after the injection, we observed several significant effects on the hepatic concentrations of the enzymes and metabolites of methionine metabolism. Methionine and S-adenosylmethionine remained at control levels; the concentrations of S-adenosylhomocysteine exceeded the control values from 4 to 16 h; and the levels of serine and betaine were lower after 16 h. Treatment with nicotinamide resulted in higher hepatic levels of methionine adenosyltransferase (after 4 h) and cystathionine synthase (after 16 h). These data indicate that increases in both homocysteine methylation and S-adenosylmethionine synthesis may be components of the response to excessive methyl group consumption. An increased synthesis of cystathionine would provide for the removal of S-adenosylhomocysteine (and homocysteine) derived from the adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of nicotinamide.\r"

Approximately 4- to 5-wk-old corpulent (cp/cp) and lean (+/?) male rats consumed a diet containing 54% carbohydrate as either cooked cornstarch or 27% cooked cornstarch and 27% fructose for 9.5 mo. After consuming the diet for 3 mo, corpulent rats were hyperinsulinemic, hyperlipidemic and exhibited glycosuria. After consuming the diet for 9.5 mo corpulent rats were twofold heavier and pancreatic weight was 77% that of their lean littermates. Corpulent rats that consumed starch exhibited lower total pancreatic protein with no significant change in total DNA and RNA. In the corpulent rat, both lipase- and chymotrypsinogen-specific activities and both the specific activities and the content of amylase or trypsinogen were lower than those of lean littermates. Fructose consumption resulted in lower pancreatic copper and iron concentrations, and zinc concentration was elevated in corpulent rats. This study suggests that the SHR/N-corpulent rat may be a useful model for studying exocrine pancreatic function in insulin-independent diabetes.\r"

After 8 mo, in vivo pH measurements revealed that acidification of luminal contents occurred in the cecum and in mid and distal colons of rats fed fiber-supplemented diets when compared with the fiber-free controls (P less than 0.05). Pectin and guar produced the greatest acidification of luminal contents, the largest increase in cecal surface area and the highest percentage of colonic cells in S-phase, as measured by flow cytometry. In the proximal colon of the pectin group 9.2 +/- 0.5% of cells were in S-phase (6.3 +/- 0.8% with the fiber-free group) (P less than 0.05) and in the distal colon of the guar group 10.9 +/- 1.4% were in S-phase (7.1 +/- 0.5% with the fiber-free group) (P less than 0.05). Even though the most fermentable fibers produced the greatest mitogenic response, there was no site-specific correlation between pH and mucosal cell growth except in the cecum. This suggests that fibers may act as colon cell growth factors by some mechanism other than extracellular pH changes.\r"

Except at the 0.2 mg/kg Se level, Se accumulated in all tissues at higher levels when SeM was fed than when selenite was given, and the magnitude of difference became more pronounced with increasing levels of dietary Se. This was particularly true for muscle and brain. Se levels in whole blood, testes, kidney and lungs were not significantly different between rats fed 0.2 mg/kg Se as selenite or as SeM, but the Se levels in liver, muscle and brain were higher in rats fed SeM. Although the tissue Se concentrations differed markedly, there were no differences in the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in tissues of rats fed SeM rather than selenite. The percentage of Se associated with GPX was lower in all tissues from rats fed SeM than in those from rats fed selenite. These results indicate that the chemical forms of dietary Se can have a marked influence on biological responses, including bioavailability of dietary Se.\r"

  ".U": "88274573\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that liver glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, EC 1.11.1.9) protein level and activity decrease exponentially during Se deficiency. To determine the effect of Se repletion on these parameters, Se-deficient rats were repleted with 0.1 or 0.5 mg Se/kg diet as Na2SeO3 in a 30% torula yeast-based diet and were killed 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or 14 d later. GSH-Px protein was quantitated using anti-GSH-Px antibodies. Dietary repletion with 0.5 mg Se/kg diet increased GSH-Px protein and activity significantly (P less than 0.05) after 1 d. After 5 d for GSH-Px protein and 7 d for activity the rate of increase slowed, and at d 14 neither GSH-Px protein nor activity was significantly different from that of Se-adequate rats. Repletion with 0.1 mg Se/kg diet did not significantly increase GSH-Px protein or activity until 14 d. To examine the short-term effect of Se repletion, Se-deficient rats were injected intravenously with 15 or 60 micrograms Se as Na2SeO3 and killed 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 h later. Only rats injected with 60 micrograms Se and killed 24 h later had a significant increase in GSH-Px activity along with a marginally significant increase in GSH-Px protein. These response curves indicate that homeostatic processes control the level of GSH-Px. The lack of an increase in GSH-Px until 24 h after Se administration implies that additional metabolic events after a rise in cellular Se may be necessary prior to an increase in GSH-Px synthesis in Se-deficient rats.\r"

Diets II and III also contained 10 mg/kg of dietary Cu, except that Zn was elevated to 1000 mg/kg for diet II, or Cd was added at 10 mg/kg for diet III. Diet IV was deficient in Cu (less than 1 mg/kg) with Zn at 100 mg/kg and no added Cd. At wk 6 postweaning, half of the rats fed diets I and IV were injected once with Cd acetate (5 mg Cd/kg body weight). The immediate response to Cd injection was an increase in metallothionein accumulation (three- to fourfold) and in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) accumulation (1.2- to 1.5-fold) in liver. SOD was estimated in an ELISA. These responses were not influenced by a change in Cu status (I vs. IV). However, in functional assays, SOD enzymatic activity was about half that of the control values. In this regard, SOD appears to be given high priority with respect to the utilization of cellular Cu, i.e., a 10-fold reduction in hepatic Cu only resulted in a twofold reduction in SOD activity and the amount of apoenzyme remained at normal levels.\r"

Placental zinc transfer was assessed in control and ethanol-fed dams on d 14-15 of pregnancy. Litters from ethanol-fed dams were characterized by a high resorption frequency and fewer live fetuses per litter than litters from control dams. In addition, fetuses from the ethanol-fed dams weighed less than control fetuses. However, despite the negative effects of ethanol intake on litter outcome, placental and fetal retention of 65Zn was similar in the two groups. Therefore, an ethanol-induced fetal zinc deficiency does not seem to have a role in the production of the gross structural malformations associated with fetal alcohol syndrome when adequate zinc is provided in the diet.\r"

In experiment 1, chicks inoculated one time with 1 X 10(6) sporulated E. acervulina oocysts had a faster rate of compensatory gain than chicks inoculated serially on three occasions with 4 X 10(5) oocysts. However, liver Cu accumulation was nearly identical for the two infection regimes. In experiment 2, rate of compensatory gain and liver Cu accumulation was compared in 1) ad libitum-fed chicks; 2) restricted-fed chicks fed 40% of ad libitum intake followed by ad libitum intake; 3) coccidiosis-infected chicks, 1 X 10(6) oocysts on d 2 of the experiment; and 4)-6) the same as 1)-3), respectively, but fed 500 mg Cu/kg diet. Restricted-fed chicks had a higher rate of compensatory gain than coccidiosis-infected chicks. Liver Cu accumulation was sixfold higher in coccidiosis-infected chicks than in restricted-fed chicks, however. In addition, liver Cu accumulation of the control (uninfected) chicks and the 40% restricted-fed chicks was identical. Thus compensatory gain during the recovery phase of coccidiosis is not responsible for the coccidiosis-induced increase in liver Cu accumulation.\r"

The flours provided 50% of diet energy, with casein added to make 8% energy as protein, vegetable oils to make 20% as fat and corn syrup solids and sugar to make 72% carbohydrate (CHO) energy. Fecal wet weight increased (P less than 0.05) from approximately 100 g/d (casein diets) to means (+/- SD) of 202 +/- 72, 171 +/- 58, 154 +/- 46 and 190 +/- 67 g/d; dry weights from means of 14.7-18.3 g/d to means of 22.9-24.4 g/d (P less than 0.05); fecal energy from means of 50-60 kcal/d to means of 89-94 kcal/d (P less than 0.01); fetal fat was generally not affected; and fecal CHO nearly tripled (P less than 0.01) from approximately 4 to 12 g/d. Apparent nitrogen absorptions and retentions from the cassava + casein diets were modestly lower than from casein diets. Rates of weight gain were very variable and not significantly different by diet; serum albumin levels were essentially unchanged. The results with these flours were indistinguishable from each other and from those previously found with freeze-dried cassava flour in otherwise identical diets. Variety and processing method had no effect on the digestibility of cassava starch and oligosaccharides and on the great resistance to digestion and the water-holding capacity of cassava fiber.\r"

Three weeks after the ascorbic acid treatment was withdrawn, mean urinary ascorbic acid levels were significantly lower than their corresponding basal levels. At both 2 and 5 wk after withdrawal of ascorbic acid treatment, mean plasma ascorbic acid levels were below normal. The results indicate that these animals had experienced a transient withdrawal effect after administration of large doses of ascorbic acid that lasted about 1 wk. This, in turn, indicates that the rate of ascorbic acid turnover was probably increased during treatment, and this effect persisted even after the ascorbic acid was withdrawn. Examination of data from each individual experimental animal revealed that the pattern of urinary ascorbic acid excretion after the withdrawal of large doses of ascorbic acid varied from animal to animal. Among the twelve experimental guinea pigs, seven had abnormally low urinary ascorbic acid levels 2-4 wk after the withdrawal of the large doses of ascorbic acid.\r"

Rats were then dosed with 0 or 2.0 mg T-2 toxin/kg body weight and killed 4, 8 or 12 h after dosing. The large neutral amino acid supplements successfully reduced brain concentrations of tryptophan and serotonin in control rats, but this was not enough to overcome the acute effects seen in T-2 toxin-treated rats. A further experiment was then conducted to monitor the effect of T-2 toxin on the ratio of free to protein-bound tryptophan in plasma. Total plasma tryptophan increased in T-2 toxin-treated rats, although there were no significant differences in the ratio of free to protein-bound tryptophan. A final experiment was conducted to determine the specificity of the T-2 toxin effect on concentrations of plasma amino acids. Concentrations of amino acids that use the large neutral amino acid transport system into the brain were higher in T-2 toxin-treated animals. The only other amino acid that had a higher concentration was arginine. It was concluded that acute doses of T-2 toxin may selectively alter membrane transport of amino acids.\r"

Energy intake, weight gain and the weight of the pituitary and prostate glands in rats bearing either tumor was lower in rats fed the fat-free diet than in those fed the 20% corn oil diet. There were no differences in serum prolactin, pituitary prolactin or serum testosterone associated with dietary fat concentration in any study. In summary, no differences in transplantable prostate tumor growth were seen over a wide range of lipid intake (0.5-20%), although a fat-free diet reduced the growth of the R3327-H prostate adenocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The social standing of marijuana use in Costa Rica becomes important as one examines the results of this study. Before 1968, marijuana use itself defined Costa Rican consumers of the drug as lower class. Its coming to fashionability among Costa Rican upper-middle-class youths during the late 1960's and early 1970's temporarily blurred marijuana's class identification. Nevertheless, the lower-class users' dress, speech and style of use kept them distinct from these youths. In 1986, working-class users participating in the present intensive study still occupied the lowest positions in the Costa Rican social strata. Their marijuana use does not appear to be a major factor in blocking upward mobility. The social stations in which users were raised were more powerful in determining their present fates than taking up or not taking up marijuana use. Users speak the language differently, employing a mix of lexical changes and wordplay to keep the decent Costa Ricans out of their clandestine business. Smokers of marijuana also dress differently from other Costa Ricans and tend to live in disreputable barrios, according to the stereotype. The Costa Rican image of a marijuana smoker is one of a streetwise, corrupt and uncomfortably distinctive character who is not to be trusted. The main problem in assessing the relationship between marijuana use and the human condition of marijuana users is the pervasive influence of the general social disapproval of marijuana smoking in Costa Rican society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The distal one third of the radius and the midportion of the humerus were evaluated for measurements of BMC with an unmodified, commercially available bone densitometer. We assessed reproducibility of BMC and bone width (BW) measurements and defined normal at-birth ranges of BMC, BW, and BMC/BW ratio for infants with gestational ages of 24 to 42 weeks. Humerus BMC correlated with gestational age, birth weight, and BW of patients and did not differ from humerus BMC values determined over the same range of gestational ages at another center. Representative serial measurements of two very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of using humerus BMC in longitudinal studies to assess changes in bone mineralization. We conclude that bone densitometer measurements of mid-humerus BMC can be successfully performed and are preferable to similar measurements of the radius for VLBW infants. Normal humerus BMC values were defined for use in diagnosis and evaluation of the efficacy of treatment in VLBW infants who are at high risk of developing osteopenia of prematurity.\r"

The infants fed soy-based formula also had BMC measured at 6 and 12 months; the BMC of these infants was compared to the BMC of human milk-fed historical control subjects. The BMC was similar at 2 weeks in both groups but was lower in infants fed soy-based formula than in human milk-fed infants at 2 and 4 months. The BMC was similar in historical control subjects fed human milk and in soy formula-fed infants at 6 and 12 months. In the Steichen-Tsang study, the BMC of 17 soy formula-fed infants and of 17 white infants fed cow milk-based formula was measured at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months of age. The BMC was similar at 6 weeks in both groups but was lower in infants fed soy-based formula than in those fed cow milk-based formula at 3, 6, and 12 months. The BMC of the historical control group fed human milk and of the soy formula-fed infants was also similar. In the first year of life, the BMC of infants fed soy formula and those fed human milk appears to be similar, especially after 6 months of age. However, the BMC of infants so fed may be lower than that of infants fed cow milk-based formula.\r"

Mineralization was similar in all three groups. Over the first year, BMC had a significantly positive slope. However, BMC appeared to increase during the first 4 months, plateau at 6 months, and then resume an increasing pattern. Bone width (BW) increased steadily over the first year; therefore the BMC/BW ratio actually dropped at around 6 months. The BMC was also correlated with body length. \"Average density,\" which was calculated by the formula BMC/pi (BW/2)2, showed a steady decline as age increased. The ratio of BMC to body length over the first year may be an option for comparing individual data to normal data when growth is abnormal.

Alterations in mineral homeostasis include abnormal patterns of serum (Ca and P concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity) and urine (Ca and P) biochemical markers, low net Ca and P retentions in comparison with intrauterine estimates of mineral accretion, and decreased bone mineral content. A two-phase study was conducted in our laboratory to test for these alterations in mineral homeostasis. In phase 1, VLBW infants fed a preparation of fortified human milk (either human milk-derived fortifier I or II or cow milk-derived fortifier) or cow milk-based formula specially designed for VLBW infants were evaluated during their hospitalization. In phase 2, after hospitalization, these infants were evaluated during the first 6 months of life when fed either their mother's milk or routine formula exclusively. The bioavailability of Ca and P from the tested preparations varied widely. Although the fortification of human milk resulted in both an improved biochemical pattern and net retention of Ca and P, optimal intrauterine mineral accretion was not achieved in any group tested. Longitudinal assessments of bone mineralization, by single photon absorptiometry, demonstrated that human milk-fed former VLBW infants had reduced bone mineral content. These investigations suggest that former VLBW infants fed human milk exclusively may be at risk for Ca and P deficiencies.\r"

The present study was designed to determine if reserpine-induced supersensitivity could be demonstrated in isolated guinea pig right ventricular strips, if it was associated with beta adrenoceptor proliferation and was specific for beta adrenoceptor agonists. In addition, reserpine dose-dependency of the phenomenon was tested for by using two pretreatment regimens to determine if supersensitivity was the result of direct or possibly toxic effects of reserpine. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with reserpine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days resulted in over 90% depletion of cardiac norepinephrine stores. Supersensitivity to the inotropic effects of isoproterenol, impromidine and forskolin was demonstrated. Associated with the supersensitivity was a significant increase in beta adrenoceptor density. Muscarinic receptor density was actually decreased. This pretreatment regimen also was associated with a significant (30%) drop in body weight suggesting that the phenomenon might be the result of a direct toxic effect of reserpine. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with a lower dose of reserpine (0.03 mg/kg/day) for 7 days produced the same degree of norepinephrine depletion, nonspecific inotropic supersensitivity and beta adrenoceptor proliferation in the absence of a significant reduction in body weight. The degree of supersensitivity induced by the two pretreatment regimens was between 2- to 3-fold for all three agonists tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Key pecking was established under a schedule of reinforcement in which periods of food-maintained responding alternated with periods in which behavior also was suppressed by the presentation of electric shock. Buspirone (0.1-10.0 mg/kg), gepirone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1-3.0 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) and to a lesser extent clozapine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) all produced increases in punished responding at doses having little effect on or decreasing the rate of unpunished responding. Neurochemical analyses on samples of cerebrospinal fluid after administration of several doses of each compound were performed for the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the noradrenergic metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Gepirone, 8-OH-DPAT and the novel anxiolytic buspirone produced decreases in 5-HIAA at doses that increased punished responding in the behavioral studies. Buspirone increased levels of HVA and DOPAC, whereas its structural analog gepirone and the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT had little effect on or decreased levels of these metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide, a prototypic benzodiazepine anxiolytic, produced only modest decreases in each of the metabolites studied. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, produced increases in each of the metabolites studied, although only the 5-HIAA effect occurred at doses that were not behaviorally disruptive. Haloperidol (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) produced only decreases in punished and unpunished responding, whereas eliciting increases in the appearance of MHPG, DOPAC and HVA; levels of 5-HIAA were relatively unaffected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significant inhibition of guanidine uptake was obtained with relatively high concentrations of the chloride salts of several inorganic cations including Mg++. Cytoplasmic acidification activating Na+-H+ exchanger-mediated Na+ uptake did not stimulate guanidine uptake and its efflux was the same over a 10-min rinse period, whether the pH of the rinse medium was 6.8 or 7.7.\r"

Addition of 75 mM EtOH to the bath water of holding tanks produced 47 to 54 mM EtOH levels in the hemolymph (blood) within 24 hr. These hemolymph EtOH levels were maintained for weeks by daily changes of the bath water containing 75 mM EtOH. After 24 hr of exposure to 75 to 150 mM EtOH in vivo, crayfish showed behavioral signs of intoxication as measured by a significant increase in righting reflex times and a significant decrease in tail-flip escape behavior. After 2 weeks of chronic exposure to 75 mM EtOH, crayfish showed behavioral tolerance as measured by a decrease in righting time and an increase in tail-flip escape behavior to control levels. EtOH applied acutely to opener nerve-muscle preparations in vitro at 10 to 100 mM concentrations produced an increased probability of transmitter release as measured by an increased frequency of spontaneous release of transmitter quanta and an increased amplitude of facilitated synaptic potentials evoked by 10 to 40 Hz stimulation of the excitor axon. Acute application of 300 to 600 mM EtOH resulted in a decreased amplitude of facilitated synaptic potentials due primarily to a decrease in postsynaptic input resistance. These data suggest that EtOH has a concentration-dependent biphasic effect on synaptic transmission.\r"

Rat pancreatic lobules were incubated in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-Ringer's buffer and amylase release in response to KCl depolarization of the intrapancreatic nerve in the absence or presence of specific opiate subtype receptor agonists was studied. Depolarization by 75 mM KCl resulted in a 5-fold increase in amylase output. Pretreatment with 1 microM atropine inhibited completely the KCl-stimulated amylase release, suggesting stimulation via a cholinergic pathway. Addition of methionine enkephalin or 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin [( D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin, a specific delta receptor agonist) inhibited KCl-stimulated amylase release in a dose-dependent fashion. Methionine enkephalin (1 microM) or [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin inhibited KCl-stimulated amylase release by 32 +/- 4 and 45 +/- 4%, respectively. Addition of 1 microM ICI 174,864 (a delta opiate receptor antagonist) blocked the inhibitory effect of [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin. Upjohn 50,488H (1 microM, a specific kappa agonist) and 1 microM Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (a specific mu agonist) had no effect. Methionine enkephalin had no effect on carbachol (1 microM)-stimulated amylase release. These data suggest that methionine enkephalin acts on a delta opiate receptor located on postganglionic cholinergic neurons. To examine the ability of methionine enkephalin to alter acetylcholine release from pancreatic tissue, pancreatic lobules were incubated with [3H]choline and the release of synthesized [3H]acetylcholine was stimulated by KCl. Depolarization of the nerves with 75 mM KCl increased [3H]acetylcholine release by 35 +/- 5% over basal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Drug binding to DPPC was quantitated using Scatchard analysis. The tested drugs bound to DPPC with different capacities. The order of binding capacity to hydrophobic site of DPPC using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as fluorescence probe was promethazine greater than amiodarone greater than chlorpromazine greater than chloramphenicol greater than imipramine greater than trimipramine greater than propranolol much greater than chloroquine and chlorphentermine. Two binding affinities were evident for amiodarone, chlorpromazine, imipramine, trimipramine and promethazine. The order of binding strength at high affinity site was amiodarone greater than trimipramine greater than chlorpromazine greater than promethazine greater than imipramine. The order of drug binding capacity using ANS as fluorescence probe was chlorphentermine greater than trimipramine greater than propranolol much greater than amiodarone, chloroquine and chloramphenicol. Each of these drugs displayed a single binding affinity. Imipramine and chlorpromazine at 1 mM and higher concentrations showed intense fluorescence with ANS (5-20 microM) in the absence of DPPC indicating an interaction of these drugs with ANS. Chloroquine did not bind to either sites on DPPC. The binding of these drugs and their interactions with hydrophobic or hydrophilic sites of DPPC were correlated with their capacity to induce pulmonary phospholipidosis. These results indicate that not all the drugs which bind to DPPC in vitro induce phospholipidosis in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic ethanol exposure on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-coupled chloride ion channel was studied in synaptoneurosomes from rat cerebral cortex. Ethanol was administered to rats by inhalation resulting in high blood ethanol levels which have previously been shown to produce tolerance and dependence. After 14 days of ethanol exposure, the stimulation (apparent Vmax) of 36Cl- uptake by the GABA agonist muscimol was decreased by approximately 26%. Similarly, stimulation of 36Cl- uptake by the barbiturate pentobarbital was also reduced to the same extent and there was an increase in the apparent EC50 concentration. Direct stimulation of 36Cl- uptake by ethanol was unchanged after chronic ethanol exposure when measured in the same membrane preparations in which a decrease in muscimol and pentobarbital-stimulated 36Cl- uptake were observed. However, ethanol's ability to potentiate muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake was abolished completely in synaptoneurosomes from ethanol-treated rats. The decrease in GABA receptor-coupled chloride ion channel function observed after chronic ethanol administration was observed only in animals where the mean blood ethanol concentration was greater than or equal to 150 mg%. These blood levels have previously been shown to be associated with ethanol withdrawal after ethanol discontinuation in this rat strain. Four days after ethanol administration, after all signs of ethanol withdrawal had subsided, the decrease in muscimol and pentobarbital-stimulated 36Cl- uptake was reversed. These data suggest that subsensitivity of the GABA receptor-coupled chloride ion channel after chronic ethanol administration may contribute to ethanol tolerance and the ethanol withdrawal syndrome.\r"

To assess pharmacokinetic and neurochemical aspects of tolerance, lorazepam (LRZ) was administered chronically to mice via implantable osmotic pumps and rotarod ataxia, plasma and brain LRZ concentrations, benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo and in vitro, chloride channel binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake were examined in various brain regions over a 14-day period. Behavioral tolerance, indicated by diminished rotarod ataxia, developed at all doses examined (1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg/day), with little change occurring before day 4. The greatest decrease in rotarod ataxia occurred between days 4 and 7. Plasma and brain LRZ concentrations were proportional to dose and were constant over time at each dose, indicating that tolerance was not pharmacokinetic. Benzodiazepine receptor binding as determined by the specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788 decreased in cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus primarily between days 4 and 7, with an approximately 50% decrement in each region by day 7. Receptor binding and rotarod ataxia in cortex were highly correlated at each dose. Apparent affinity in vivo at the receptor was unchanged in cortex, indicating that altered ligand uptake was due to decreased receptor number. Similar results were observed in membrane preparations. There was a small, nonsignificant decrease in chloride channel binding at day 7 compared to day 1. Muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes was decreased at day 7 compared to day 1. Thus, downregulation of benzodiazepine receptor binding and of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor function is closely associated with behavioral tolerance to benzodiazepines.\r"

  ".W": "One of the proposed anticonvulsant actions of phenytoin (5,5'-diphenylhydantoin) is the suppression of calcium movement through cell membranes. However, it is not known how phenytoin interacts with calcium channels to inhibit calcium accumulation in various preparations, or to interfere with calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. The objective of the present study was to examine whether phenytoin directly blocks voltage-dependent calcium channels of N1E-115 neuroblastoma, and if so, to determine what properties of channel gating are modified by this anticonvulsant. Calcium channel currents as carried by barium were recorded with the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Low-threshold, transient currents (\"type I\") were activated at membrane potentials more positive than -50 mV. Type I currents were of maximum amplitude at -20 or -10 mV. High-threshold, sustained currents (\"type II\") were activated at potentials more positive than -10 mV. Application of phenytoin, at concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 microM, suppressed type I currents without changing their time course or voltage dependence of activation. Type II currents, on the other hand, were insensitive to phenytoin within this concentration range. The block of type I currents by phenytoin was enhanced when the membrane was maintained at more depolarized holding potentials, due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation relationship. In addition to the \"resting block\" of type I channels, phenytoin exerted an additional component of blocking at stimulation frequencies higher than 0.5 Hz. These voltage- and frequency-dependent blocking actions suggest that phenytoin shifts the channel population toward the inactivated state, allowing fewer channels to open during membrane depolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prior exposure of U-937 cells to LTB4 resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in Ca++ mobilization in response to a subsequent challenge with LTB4 (EC50 = 2 nM; T1/2 = 4 min). Desensitization was temperature-dependent, occurring in cells pretreated with LTB4 at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. LTB4 pretreatment (100 nM, 30 min) decreased the maximal LTB4-induced Ca++ mobilization by 50% and increased the EC50 5-fold. After the cells were treated with LTB4, Ca++ mobilization in response to LTD4, platelet activating factor and chemotactic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine were not decreased, suggesting that the desensitization was homologous and specific for LTB4. In U-937 cells, LTB4 and LTD4 induced concentration- and time-dependent and receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, which correlated with Ca++ mobilization. When U-937 cells were pretreated with LTB4, the amount of intracellular PI metabolites formed in response to LTB4 was reduced, whereas the response to LTD4 was unchanged. Examination of LTB4 membrane receptors in U-937 cells indicated that LTB4 pretreatment resulted in a 15% decrease in receptor number and a 3-fold decrease in affinity for LTB4. These results clearly demonstrate that LTB4-induced Ca++ mobilization and PI metabolism can be desensitized by prior exposure to LTB4 and that the mechanism of desensitization may involve altered affinity in agonist binding to the receptor.\r"

Subjects were exposed to 10 experimentally independent choices (i.e., involving exposure and choice between novel color-coded capsule conditions) at each of several dose levels. All forced exposure and choice opportunities occurred when subjects were overnight abstinent from their normal dietary caffeine intake (mean, 116 mg/day). Significant caffeine positive reinforcement was demonstrated in 5 of 12 subjects at one or more doses. Percentage of selection of caffeine was inversely related to dose, with four subjects showing significant caffeine avoidance at 400 and/or 600 mg. Choice behavior was correlated positively with feelings of contentedness and was correlated negatively with prestudy trait anxiety scores and with ratings of capsule disliking. Compared to placebo, caffeine produced increases in subjective ratings indicating arousal while producing decreases in headache and \"craving\" for caffeine-containing foods, even at the lowest dose of 100 mg. At higher doses caffeine produced dysphoric anxiety-like subjective effects. Overall, this study provides the first demonstration in humans of the positive reinforcing effects of caffeine alone (i.e., in capsules) and documents individual differences among normal subjects in both caffeine positive reinforcement and caffeine avoidance.\r"

Either 6-hydroxydopamine or surgical denervation significantly depressed norepinephrine concentrations in the vas deferens relative to contralateral controls, thus confirming an effective sympathectomy. Guanethidine also resulted in a significant reduction in norepinephrine concentrations in the vas deferens. Base-line PGE production by the vasa deferentia was not altered by guanethidine but was attenuated by 6-hydroxydopamine and increased by surgical denervation. All the treatments reduced angiotensin-induced PGE synthesis. The effect of denervation on PGE synthesis was greater than that of norepinephrine depletion. We interpret these results to indicate that angiotensins stimulate PGE production by adrenergic nerves in the vas deferens and that released norepinephrine mediates a part of the PGE production in response to the angiotensins. The 6-hydroxydopamine experiments are consistent with the adrenergic nerves being the predominant source of PGE in this preparation.\r"

This hypotensive activity was dose-dependent, was evident in both acute and chronic assays and occurred after i.v. or i.p. administration or slow release from subdermally implanted osmotic pumps. The hypotensive activity in SHR occurred concomitant with a reduction in heart rate and a reduction in total body weight. Hearts isolated from SHR treated daily for 2 weeks with PAESe were significantly reduced in weight and in total catecholamine content. An investigation of the nature of the body weight loss which accompanied chronic dosing suggested that PAESe also possessed an anorexigenic property distinct from its antihypertensive activity. An examination of plasma electrolytes, enzymes and other metabolites from chronically treated rats showed no obvious toxic effects of such dosing.\r"

Based on the assumption that the recovery of the residual plateau Na current parallels that of Vmax, the hypothesis that Na current recovery kinetics influence the restitution of APD was tested. Drugs that reduced Vmax in a use-dependent manner (tetrodotoxin 3 microM, lidocaine 15 microM, mexiletine 20 microM) were compared with interventions that reduced Vmax in a simply tonic fashion [( Na]o 75 mM, [K]o 6.5 mM, disopyramide 30 microM). Microelectrode techniques and programmed stimulation were used to determine in vitro the kinetics of restitution of APD and of time-dependent recovery of Vmax during rest. Tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and mexiletine induced a blockade of Vmax that showed partial or full time-dependent unblocking in accordance with the known use dependence of their blocking action. Dissipation of the time-dependent component of the block in each case followed a single exponential time course, time constants being 163 +/- 12, 115 +/- 12 and 121 +/- 20 ms, respectively. Analysis of the kinetics of the APD restitution curves showed that the time constant of the fast decaying exponential component of restitution (T1) was prolonged by these drugs from 129 +/- 5 in control fibers to 295 +/- 17, 235 +/- 11 and 242 +/- 26 ms for tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and mexiletine, respectively (P less than .05). Low [Na]o and disopyramide reduced Vmax in a simply tonic fashion and did not significantly prolong the T1 component of APD restitution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intra-arterial infusion of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, increased perfusion pressure in both vascular beds over the same range of infusion rates, and the maximum responses were similar. The selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, B-HT 933, also increased perfusion pressure in both beds, although the maximum response to B-HT 933 in the saphenous bed was approximately twice that observed in the femoral bed. Responses to methoxamine were blocked by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg), but not the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (1 mg/kg), or by the selective postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, SK&F 104078 (1 mg/kg). Conversely, responses to B-HT 933 were blocked by rauwolscine and by SK&F 104078, but not by prazosin. Vasopressor responses to B-HT 933 in both vascular beds of the rat hindlimb also were reduced markedly by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 mg/kg), whereas responses to methoxamine were relatively resistant to inhibition by nifedipine. In the femoral bed, as in the systemic arterial circulation, responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were strongly inhibited by prazosin, were potentiated by rauwolscine and were unaffected by SK&F 104078. In contrast, in the saphenous arterial bed, the responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were inhibited by all three antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In nine antinociceptive assays utilizing various thermal, pressure and chemical and physical irritants, the potency of spiradoline ranges from 4.7 to 23 (mean = 13) times that of U-50488H. Naloxone blocks the analgesic effect of spiradoline. The in vivo naloxone pA2 for this antagonism is much lower than that for the antagonism of morphine and approximates that of U-50488H. The analgesic potency of spiradoline is greatly reduced in mice made tolerant to U-50488H but not in those made tolerant to morphine. Repeated treatment with spiradoline does not induce physical dependence as evidenced by a lack of naloxone-precipitated jumping and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. In sum, these observations suggest that spiradoline is a potent kappa agonist analgesic. However, further evaluation of spiradoline revealed differences between this compound and U-50488H. We have previously shown that the analgesic effect of the latter compound, but not that of morphine, is profoundly antagonized by reserpine or p-chlorophenylalanine. In contrast, spiradoline is only marginally antagonized by these serotonin-depleting treatments. Evaluation of the enantiomers of spiradoline revealed that the (-)-enantiomer is more than 30 times as potent as the (+)-enantiomer in analgesic tests. The (-)-enantiomer is similar to U-50488H with regard to antagonism by p-chlorophenylalanine, lack of physical dependence-inducing properties and cross-tolerance. In contrast the (+)-enantiomer induces physical dependence and displays marked cross-tolerance in morphine-tolerant mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 1-hr postreperfusion, subendocardial flow (microspheres) was significantly higher only with diltiazem pretreatment compared to the saline group (100 +/- 17 vs. 54 +/- 8 ml/min/100 g, respectively) and subendocardial reperfusion flows were negatively correlated to infarct size (r = 0.97, P less than .05). Thus, diltiazem only improves reflow and infarct size when infused before occlusion and this improved reflow does not occur via a direct vasodilator action of diltiazem. When maximal vasodilating doses of adenosine were given, flow in the ischemic region was nearly identical for saline and diltiazem pretreated groups despite higher preadenosine flows in the diltiazem group (higher resting flow occurred at the expense of the existing flow reserve).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The complexing activity of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) was examined in vivo and in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Intravenous infusions of the sulfhydryl form of DMPS into rats pretreated with HgCl2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the urinary excretion of mercury and a decrease in the retention of mercury in kidney. A 120-min infusion of 2 mg sulfhydryl DMPS.min-1.kg body wt-1 resulted in excretion of 76% of the mercury body burden of which greater than 90% was removed from kidney. The disulfide auto-oxidation product of DMPS significantly increased the urinary excretion of mercury in the rat, but its effect was less than that of an equivalent dose of sulfhydryl DMPS. The presence of disulfide DMPS or 3:1 mixtures of sulfhydryl DMPS and disulfide DMPS in the perfusate increased the excretion of mercury and induced a loss of mercury from the cortex and outer medulla in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Thus both the disulfide and sulfhydryl forms of DMPS can act directly on the kidney to accelerate the excretion of mercury. This is consistent with previous observations of the ability of the kidney to reduce disulfide DMPS to sulfhydryl DMPS.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were trained to discriminate between saline and 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam in a two-choice procedure where responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio, 5-response schedule of stimulus shock termination. beta-Carboline-3-carboxylate-methyl ester (beta CCM), beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-ethyl ester (beta CCE) and beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta CCtB), compounds with alkylcarboxy substitutions on the 3-position of the beta-carboline ring structure, were effective antagonists of the discriminative effects of diazepam. The 3-hydroxymethyl-substituted compound (3HMC) was relatively ineffective in antagonizing the discriminative effects of diazepam. The order of potency in antagonizing the 1.0 mg/kg training dose of diazepam was beta CCtB greater than beta CCM greater than beta CCE much greater than 3 HMC. The greater potency of beta CCtB likely reflects its resistance to metabolism in vivo. beta CCE and beta CCtB produced dose-related, parallel shifts in the dose-response curve for the discriminative effects of diazepam, but the magnitude of the shifts was limited: the two highest doses of beta CCE and beta CCtB produced shifts that were not significantly different in magnitude. These latter results suggest that these beta-carbolines antagonize only a portion of the component(s) of action of diazepam in producing discriminative stimuli. In contrast, the 7-substituted beta-carbolines harmane, harmol and harmine were ineffective in antagonizing the discriminative effects of diazepam up to doses of the beta-carbolines which disrupted the ability of the animals to respond.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The kappa agonist U50488H did not affect base-line release of [3H]DA measured in 5 mM K+, but produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the release of [3H]DA stimulated by 20 mM K+ from slices of striatum in rat and guinea pig, with an IC50 of about 0.5 nM in each case. In contrast, the mu-selective agonist, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)Phe-Gly-ol, and the delta-selective agonist, [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin, did not inhibit stimulated release from the slice preparations at concentrations up to 1 microM. The inhibitory effects of U50488H were antagonized by naloxone, and the potent and selective kappa antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI). Similar results were obtained when release of [3H]DA from rat and guinea pig cortex slices was examined. In guinea pig cortex, the maximum inhibition of DA release induced by U50488H was 80% of control-stimulated fractional release. In rat cortex and in striatum of both species the maximum release was about 40% of control fractional release. Thus, in the guinea pig, the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway appears more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of U50488H than the nigrostriatal system. The effects of the opioids on the K+ (12.5 mM)-stimulated release of [3H]DA from guinea pig striatal synaptosomes also were determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the addition of 72.7 nM K+ or 1 microM norepinephrine, muscle contraction followed the increase in R340/380 (resulted from the increased F340 and the decreased F380). Cytosolic Ca++ concentrations of resting, 72.7 mM K+-stimulated and 1 microM norepinephrine-stimulated aortas were tentatively calculated as 228 +/- 25, 1784 +/- 154 and 1528 +/- 180 nM, respectively. Cumulative addition of K+ or norepinephrine induced concentration-dependent increase in both muscle tension and R340/380. However, norepinephrine induced greater contraction than K+ when both of these stimulants induced similar increase in R340/380. Addition of 10 mM tetraethylammonium and 1 microM Bay k8644 caused rhythmic contractions which followed the rhythmic changes in R340/380. EGTA decreased the muscle contraction and decreased R340/380. In Ca++-free solution, addition of 10 microM norepinephrine or 20 mM caffeine induced transient increase in both muscle tension and R340/380. Tension changes always were preceded by the fluorescent changes. Verapamil (10 microM) decreased both tension development and R340/380 in high K+- and norepinephrine-stimulated tissues. Sodium nitroprusside (1 microM) also decreased both tension and R340/380 in norepinephrine-stimulated tissues, whereas it decreased tension more strongly than R340/380 in high K+-stimulated tissues. These results indicate that vasoconstrictors and vasodilators may modulate smooth muscle contraction by changing the cytosolic Ca++ concentrations and also by changing the sensitivity of contractile elements to Ca++.\r"

The effect of milrinone on the sensitivity of cardiac Mg-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity to calcium was studied in purified myofibrils isolated from normal human hearts (after accidental death or trauma that caused no cardiac damage as established by the attending physician) and from normal canine hearts (established by echocardiography), over a range of calcium concentrations (pCa, 8 to 5). Caffeine, a cardiac stimulant that has been shown to increase the sensitivity of myofibrillar Mg-ATPase activity to calcium in rat ventricle, was used in this study to establish its effect on canine and human myofibrils in comparison with that of milrinone. Caffeine, at concentrations of 40 mM, caused statistically significant sensitization of canine and human myofibrils to calcium.

Repeated footshock stress was found to produce supersensitivity to isoproterenol and epinephrine (increase of 4.6- and 1.99-fold at pD2 level, respectively), but not to norepinephrine. Experiments using salbutamol, in the presence of an effective blocking concentration of metoprolol, showed that footshock stress increases the sensitivity (2.69-fold at pD2 level) to the selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Footshock stress had no effect on the atrial sensitivity to theophylline (1.09-fold at pD2 level). Addition of butoxamine (1 microM) suppressed footshock-induced pacemaker supersensitivity to isoproterenol and epinephrine. Footshock stress causes a small (3.23-fold) but pharmacologically unimportant increase in pacemaker pA2 value of metoprolol. However, footshock stress induces a large increase in the pacemaker beta-2 adrenoceptor affinity for butoxamine (11.48-fold, pA2 value). It is concluded that repeated footshock stress acts primarily to increase the chronotropic function of pacemaker beta-2 adrenoceptors, thus causing supersensitivity to isoproterenol, epinephrine and salbutamol.\r"

From the right shifts of isoprenaline dose-response curves 0 to 84 hr after administration of propranolol and the beta-1 selective bisoprolol, in vivo beta blockade was assessed. In an in vitro radioreceptor assay with membrane preparations of beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors, plasma samples were assayed for subtype selective blocking activity. After propranolol administration, in vitro beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor occupancy declined from initially 97% to less than 10% within 48 hr. An isoprenaline dose ratio (DR)-1 of 1 coincided with a 50% occupancy of the beta-1 or the beta-2 subtype in vitro. In Schild-plots using plasma concentrations (radioreceptor assay) and the isoprenaline DR-1 for heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and inotropy (QS2C), slopes of unity were observed. After bisoprolol administration, in vitro beta-1 occupancy shifted from initially 95% to less than 10% within 72 hr. For the beta-2 subtype, an occupancy of greater than 10% was detectable only within the first 12 hr. An isoprenaline DR-1 of 1 coincided with a 50% occupancy of beta-1 adrenoceptors. The bisoprolol Schild-plots yielded a slope of unity for inotropy, but less than unity for the heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. From an extended analysis of subtype selective antagonism in Schild-plots, the fractions of the beta-2 adrenoceptor subtype participating in the isoprenaline response were calculated: heart rate 0.45 +/- 0.12 and diastolic blood pressure 0.23 +/- 0.13. It is concluded that in vitro receptor occupancy can predict beta blockade in humans for propranolol. Beta adrenoceptor subtype-mediated effects in humans can be evaluated with a selective antagonist and a refined analysis of Schild-plot data.\r"

  ".W": "The renal excretion mechanism of cefixime, a newly developed and p.o. effective cephalosporin antibiotic, was investigated by using the renal brush-border membrane vesicles from the rat kidney cortex. The initial uptake rate of cefixime into an osmotically sensitive vesicular space showed concentration and temperature dependencies, indicating the presence of a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for cefixime. Kinetic parameters for apparently saturable and nonsaturable components were evaluated as follows: maximum uptake rate was 7.32 +/- 1.07 nmol/30 sec/mg of protein; Michaelis constant was 7.35 +/- 2.04 mM; and the first-order rate constant was 0.34 +/- 0.02 nmol/30 sec/mg of protein per mM. The uptake was not affected by an inward-directed gradient of Na+, K+, Li+, Rb+ or H+. In contrast, the initial uptake rate was enhanced by an inside-positive membrane potential imposed by valinomycin. Although amino acids, dipeptides and organic cations had no effects on the uptake of cefixime, organic anions such as probenecid and p-aminohippuric acid and anion transport inhibitors such as 4,4'-diisothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and furosemide reduced the uptake significantly. Twenty beta-lactam antibiotics including both zwitter-ionic and anionic derivatives inhibited significantly the uptake of cefixime. Furthermore, by adding probenecid in the extravesicular medium, an efflux of cefixime from the brush-border membrane vesicles was enhanced significantly at the initial stage. Benzylpenicillin, cephalothin and cephradine also enhanced an efflux of cefixime to the same extent as observed by the addition of probenecid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The melanophores of isolated scales survived in a culture medium for up to 20 days. During this period a progressive increase in sensitivity to exogenously applied noradrenaline took place. After 8 days of isolation there was an about 300-fold increase in sensitivity to noradrenaline. The increased sensitivity was accompanied by a progressive loss of the nerve-elicited response during the first days of isolation. Before and during this early period cocaine was found to potentiate the effect of noradrenaline about 8-fold. On the 3rd day after isolation the effect of cocaine was lost, which coincided fairly well with the time when the nerve-mediated response was lost. The early developing increase in sensitivity to noradrenaline (8-fold) is therefore most likely caused by loss of presynaptic amine uptake, but the main part (50-fold) of the increase in sensitivity presumably has other explanations, like changes in the receptor population.\r"

  ".W": "Reflex activation of the pudendal nerve from bladder and urethral afferent fibers is believed to contribute to maintaining normal urinary continence under stress and to the pathophysiologic behavior seen in the urethral sphincter after suprasacral spinal cord injury. We sought to determine whether clonidine could influence, at a central level, somatic and viscerosomatic reflexes on the pudendal nerve independent of actions on the sympathetic nervous system. The expected central antisympathetic activity of clonidine could be demonstrated by near maximal lowering of the blood pressure at 5 micrograms/kg of clonidine. The drug had no influence on urethral constriction evoked by stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the pudendal nerve. However, central effects on the pudendal (somatic) nerve outflow could be demonstrated in both functional and electrophysiological experiments. Clonidine (5-50 micrograms/kg) inhibited the urethral constriction produced by stimulation of the central cut end of the pudendal nerve. Similarly, the compound action potentials recorded on the pudendal nerve in response to stimulation of the central cut end of the contralateral pelvic or pudendal nerves were reduced by as much as 75 to 85% by clonidine. The clonidine effect on the reflexes was resistant to acute transection of the spinal cord at T10; however, the antagonistic activity of prazosin was reduced dramatically. Yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg) but not prazosin (0.2 mg/kg) reversed the clonidine effect. There was no relationship between the action of clonidine on blood pressure and its action on the reflexes. We conclude that clonidine acts in the sacral spinal cord at alpha-2-adrenoceptors to depress a viscerosomatic and a somatic reflex associated with external urethral sphincter function.\r"

  ".W": "In the present electrophysiological studies, the effects of the putative 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonist, BMY 7378, on the response of dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT neurons and of CA3 dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons to 5-HT and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were investigated in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. The effectiveness of microiontophoretically applied 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT in suppressing the firing activity of both neuronal populations was assessed before and during the microiontophoretic application of BMY 7378. BMY 7378 reduced the effectiveness of 8-OH-DPAT, but not that of 5-HT, in depressing 5-HT neuron firing rate, whereas that of both agonists was reduced by concurrent application of BMY 7378 in the hippocampus. To assess whether endogenous 5-HT also could be antagonized, the response of pyramidal neurons to electrical activation of the 5-HT pathway was determined before and after i.v. BMY 7378. Low doses enhanced the efficacy of the stimulation, whereas higher doses decreased it. The latter finding suggests that BMY 7378 antagonizes the effect of endogenous 5-HT. Three procedures were used to investigate the enhancing effect of BMY 7378 on 5-HT synaptic transmission: 1) administration of BMY 7378 after terminal 5-HT autoreceptor blockade by methiothepin: methiothepin abolished the enhancing effect of BMY 7378; 2) blockade of the effect of RU 24969, a terminal 5-HT autoreceptor agonist: pretreatment with methiothepin, but not with BMY 7378, blocked the effect of RU 24969 on 5-HT synaptic transmission; and 3) administration of BMY 7378 during a reduced level of activation of terminal 5-HT autoreceptors, obtained by lowering the stimulation frequency from 1 to 0.5 Hz: the enhancing effect of BMY 7378 was reduced when the stimulation was delivered at 0.5 Hz. It is concluded that BMY 7378 is an effective antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors in vivo and that the mechanism of its enhancing effect on 5-HT transmission at low doses, although still undetermined, is not due to a competitive interaction at the terminal 5-HT autoreceptor.\r"

Adult female rats were pretreated with uranyl nitrate (5 mg/kg i.v.) to produce renal dysfunction. Saline-injected rats served as controls. The concentration-effect relationship of HB was determined both at onset of loss of righting reflex (LRR) during an i.v. infusion (0.563 mg/min) and at offset of LRR after administration of a bolus dose (82 and 111 mg/kg in renal failure and controls, respectively, inducing similar durations of effect). In renal failure HB concentrations in serum (total and free) and in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) both at onset and offset of LRR were reduced significantly. When HB was infused at different rates (0.225, 0.563 and 1.50 mg/min) rats with renal impairment had slightly increasing HB concentrations at onset of LRR with increasing infusion rate, not only in serum and brain but also in CSF. When HB was administered in different bolus doses (71, 77, 80 and 96 mg/kg i.v.) the duration of effect increased linearly with the logarithm of the dose, but HB concentrations in serum (both total and free), brain and CSF at offset of LRR were similar, indicating the absence of (inter)active metabolites. The results indicate that renal dysfunction is associated with an increased sensitivity of the brain to HB, which is unrelated to changes in the disposition of HB.\r"

The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to examine action potential and currents. Stable recordings of calcium current (average peak amplitude of 563 +/- 256 pA per cell, n = 83) were obtained. Application of histamine (5 nM-10 microM) resulted in marked modification of action potentials and calcium current. Calcium current was enhanced by histamine in a concentration-dependent manner (half-maximal dose, 10 nM) up to 315% of the control level. Action potentials were prolonged by small doses of histamine whereas larger doses caused voltage instabilities and spontaneous arrhythmic bursts. Histamine effects were reduced by cimetidine and ranitidine (1 microM), two H2-receptor antagonists. After the calcium current was increased by intracellular perfusion of micromolar cyclic AMP saturating doses of histamine had no effect. Micromolar concentrations of acetylcholine rapidly antagonized the histamine effect. The latter results indicate that the response to histamine is based on H2-receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP regulation of phosphorylation of calcium channel.\r"

  ".W": "SOM-1122 was found to be a high-affinity, partial agonist for beta adrenergic receptors. SOM-1122 inhibited the binding of [125I]iodopindolol to membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. GTP regulated the binding of SOM-1122 by increasing the Hill coefficient in both tissues and reducing the affinity of the receptor for SOM-1122 in the cerebellum. SOM-1122 increased the concentration of cyclic AMP in slices of rat cerebral cortex in a dose-dependent manner; this effect was antagonized by propranolol. Two lines of evidence suggested that SOM-1122 was centrally active after peripheral administration. First, SOM-1122 inhibited the binding of [125I]iodopindolol in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Second, after chronic infusion with SOM-1122 for 7 days, the density of beta adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum was reduced; receptor density also was reduced 18 hr after acute administration of SOM-1122, although to a lesser extent. SOM-1122 was found to be behaviorally active. It reduced locomotor activity and reduced response rate under a multiple fixed-interval, fixed-ratio schedule in a dose-dependent manner. SOM-1122 also reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule. These behavioral actions of SOM-1122 appeared to be due to an interaction of the agonist with beta adrenergic receptors, as they were antagonized by propranolol. The behavioral changes produced by stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors with SOM-1122 were generally similar to those caused by other centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists and by antidepressant drugs.\r"

X-ray film and nuclear emulsion-coated coverslips were exposed to sections of coronary artery previously incubated with [125I]iodocyanopindolol (50 pM) in the absence and presence of ICI 118,551 (70 nM) to block beta-2 adrenoceptors, CGP 20712A (100 nM) to block beta-1 adrenoceptors or (-)-propranolol (1 microM) to define nonspecific binding. The medial smooth muscle of the coronary artery had an even distribution of beta-1 adrenoceptors and two populations of beta-2 adrenoceptors, one evenly distributed and the other highly localized. Beta-2 adrenoceptors were also located on nerve tissue and in the adventitia. There was no evidence for localization of beta adrenoceptors on endothelial cells. Quantitative autoradiography was performed using computer-assisted image processing and the program AVID. The binding of [125I]cyanopindolol was saturable (KD = 50 pM) and competition binding curves with the beta-1 selective antagonist CGP 20712A and beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 showed beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in the proportions of 85:15% in both 0.5- and 2-mm arteries.\r"

Four proteins associated with specific aspects of neuronal and glial development were evaluated: 1) p38, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein; 2) neurofilament 200, an intermediate filament protein of the neuronal cytoskeleton; 3) myelin basic protein, an oligodendroglia and myelin-sheath associated protein; and 4) glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein of astrocytes. On postnatal days 13, 22 and 60, the amount of each protein in homogenates of cerebellum, forebrain and hippocampus was determined by radioimmunoassay. A single administration of TBT (2, 3 or 4 mg/kg i.p.) on postnatal day 5 caused dose- and region-dependent decreases in brain weight with the cerebellum being most affected. These decrements were not associated with light microscopic evidence of altered brain development (on postnatal day 61) but were accompanied by large dose- and region-dependent decreases in p38 and myelin basic protein. Decrements in both the per tissue (total) and per milligram of tissue protein (concentration) values for these proteins were observed in cerebellum and forebrain; hippocampus was largely unaffected. TBT-induced reductions in p38 and myelin basic protein were seen at dosages that did not affect brain, thymus or body weight. At dosages of TBT that did not affect body weight, reductions in brain weight, p 38 and myelin basic protein did not persist into adulthood. The data indicate that exposure to TBT on postnatal day 5 is toxic to the developing nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven daily injections of a dopamine (DA) agonist, apomorphine (APO, 5 mg/kg, b.i.d., s.c.), caused a significant increase of dynorphin A (1-8)-like immunoreactivity (DN-LI) in the striatum (140% over control) and substantia nigra (41% over control) without changing DN-LI in frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Immunocytochemistry revealed intense dynorphin A (1-17)-like immunostaining in striatal \"patch\" neurons and striatonigral fibers after APO treatment. In order to understand the mechanism of increase in the peptide level, the abundance of preprodynorphin mRNA was quantified by Northern blot hybridization with a 32P-labeled cRNA probe coding for rat preprodynorphin. Seven daily injections of APO increased the abundance of striatal preprodynorphin mRNA by 60%. In another experiment, rats received a single injection of various doses of APO (0.5-2.5 mg/kg s.c.). Striatal DN-LI was decreased by 15% 1 hr after injection of a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of APO. Seven daily injections or a single injection of D-amphetamine produced effects similar to those elicited by APO. These studies reveal that the nigrostriatal DA system plays an important role in modulating the metabolism of striatonigral dynorphin-containing neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The glucuronidation of [3H]estradiol-17 beta at the C3 vs. the C17 hydroxyl groups was determined in female Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes. A high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed to resolve the glucuronide conjugates which were then quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The rates of formation of 17 beta-estradiol 3-(beta-D-glucuronide) (E(2)3G) and 17 beta-estradiol 17-(beta-D-glucuronide) (E(2)17G) were 0.49 +/- 0.03 and 0.40 +/- 0.02 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax of estradiol glucuronidation were determined in control, pregnant (day 19 of gestation), phenobarbital-treated (80 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days) and ethinylestradiol-treated (5 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days) female rats. The least-squares estimates of Km and Vmax values as well as the confidence contours of the joint sums of squares for the parameter spaces were calculated. The Vmax (nanomoles per minute per milligram of protein) for E(2)3G was significantly decreased from 0.94 to 0.57 in pregnancy and to 0.47 as a result of ethinylestradiol treatment. The Vmax values for E(2)17G were significantly different in control (0.43), pregnant (0.31) and ethinylestradiol-treated (0.27) rats. Phenobarbital treatment slightly increased the Vmax to 0.51 for E(2)17G whereas the Vmax for E(2)3G was unchanged (0.90) compared to controls. The Km (micromolar) for E(2)3G was 144 in the controls, 112 in pregnancy and 86 and 92 as a result of treatment with ethinylestradiol and phenobarbital, respectively. The Km for E(2)17G was 60 in the controls, 40 in pregnancy, 43 and 68 as a result of ethinylestradiol and phenobarbital treatment, respectively. None of the changes in Km were statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Single oral, single i.v., and multiple oral verapamil administrations were evaluated before and after 21 days of phenobarbital treatment in healthy caucasian male volunteers. Significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of total and free verapamil and its metabolites occurred in a predictable manner. Mean total apparent oral clearance after a single dose of verapamil was increased after phenobarbital treatment (75.1 +/- 49.2 vs. 376.2 +/- 221.8 ml/min/kg, P less than .05). Clearance of free drug increased to a similar magnitude. Mean total verapamil systemic clearance was increased (9.95 +/- 1.3 vs. 18.9 +/- 8.7 ml/min/kg, P less than .05); however free drug clearance was not altered. After multiple oral administration, total verapamil apparent oral clearance was increased after phenobarbital pretreatment (21.2 +/- 9.8 vs. 91.2 +/- 28.5 ml/min/kg, P less than .05). Free drug clearance was increased similarly. Finally, the pharmacokinetic theories derived for hepatic extraction of drugs subject to a high metabolic clearance can be successfully applied to men after liver enzyme induction with phenobarbital.\r"

  ".W": "Key-peck responses of pigeons on one of two keys were reinforced intermittently under a multiple fixed-interval schedule. In one component of the schedule, a houselight provided general illumination of the experimental chamber, and responses on a red key produced food according to a 5-min fixed-interval schedule. In the alternate component, the houselight was off and responses on an amber key produced food according to the 5-min fixed-interval schedule. Each response randomly (P = .5) alternated the positions of the key colors (right or left) and the two components (houselight on or off) alternated in a mixed sequence. Thus, there were two sources of discriminative control over responding: 1) the presence or absence of the houselight and 2) the key colors. Stimulus control was assessed by comparing the relative frequencies of red-key responses in the presence and absence of the houselight. Pentobarbital decreased stimulus control of responding at intermediate (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) doses that did not appreciably alter average rates of responding. Whereas d-amphetamine decreased stimulus control only at high doses (3.0-5.6 mg/kg) that also substantially decreased response rates. The results of subsequent studies suggested that the two drugs primarily affected stimulus control exerted by the colors of the response keys. Furthermore, the effects on stimulus control produced by the two drugs were modified by a number of environmental conditions, in particular those that alter the degree of stimulus control existing before drug administration.\r"

One candidate that appears to have potential is meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). However, little is known about the pattern of Pb mobilization or redistribution produced by this chelator or about its long-term efficacy, issues that were examined in this study. After a 3- to 4-month exposure to 50 ppm of Pb acetate in drinking water, different groups of rats received an i.p. injection of saline or 25 or 50 mg/kg of DMSA once a day for either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days and were sacrificed 24 hr after the final injection. To assess long-term efficacy of the chelator, an additional group of rats received five injections (one per day) of 50 mg/kg of DMSA and were sacrificed 4 months later. Tissue analyses indicated that DMSA mobilized Pb only from soft tissue, with no loss noted from femur and consequently no observable redistribution of Pb. Large decrements in blood, brain and kidney Pb concentrations were noted, with a delayed loss from liver. The effects were not sustained, however, when assessed 4 months later. With respect to redistribution of mobilized Pb to critical organs and magnitude of decline in soft tissue Pb concentration, DMSA appears to be a safe and particularly effective chelator and thus may be a viable alternative to CaNa2EDTA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In many cases, body temperature is altered in response to opioid agonists, but the direction, magnitude and time course of alteration vary with a number of factors. Body temperature may be subject to differential modification by different opioid receptor types. The authors examined the effect (i.c.v.) of the selective mu, delta and kappa opioid agonists, [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly5-ol] enkephalin (DAGO), [D-Pen2, D-Pen5] enkephalin and U50488H, respectively, on the body temperature of restrained and unrestrained rats. Each of the three opioid agonists produced a differentiable profile of body temperature changes. DAGO caused a primary decrease in body temperature of restrained rats and an increase in body temperature of unrestrained rats. The pretreatment dose of naloxone necessary to attenuate the hyperthermic response to DAGO of unrestrained rats was 10 times higher than that required to block the hypothermic response to DAGO in restrained rats. Low doses of both [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin and U50488H caused a decrease in body temperature of both restrained and unrestrained rats. Hypothermic responses to U50488H were not blocked by naloxone, whereas hypothermic responses to [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin in unrestrained rats were potentiated by naloxone. The results indicate that the three compounds modified body temperature by different means, suggesting activation of different opioid, and perhaps nonopioid, receptors. This may reflect a differential modulation of body temperature by endogenous opioids depending on the specific peptide released and the receptor type activated. Besides the physiologic implications, body temperature responses provided a sensitive pharmacologic measure for distinguishing the in vivo activity of different selective opioid agonists.\r"

  ".W": "The relation of diet, especially fat intake, to recognized prognostic indicators for breast cancer was investigated in 666 women with a newly diagnosed infiltrating breast carcinoma. Diet during the year preceding diagnosis was assessed by interview using a food frequency questionnaire covering the intake of 114 food items. Prognostic indicators included axillary node involvement at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status, and selected histologic features of the primary tumor such as nuclear grade, histologic grade, tubule formation, mitotic activity, and nuclear size of tumor cells. After adjustment for total energy intake, age, body weight, and tumor size at diagnosis, an increase in saturated fat intake was related to an increased frequency of node involvement at diagnosis among postmenopausal patients. In contrast, an elevation in polyunsaturated fat intake was related to a reduction of the percentage of patients with positive nodes at diagnosis. This relation was observed among both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Dietary fat was not related to the estrogen receptor status of tumors. No association was found between dietary habits and histologic features of the primary tumor. These data suggest that dietary fat may have an effect on the growth or spread of breast cancer during the preclinical phase of the disease and that this effect may vary according to the type of fat considered.\r"

Association constants for 125I-labeled MAb 15 IgG, F(ab')2, and Fab were 1.9 X 10(9), 1.8 X 10(9), and 3.7 X 10(8) M-1, respectively. Immunoreactive fractions ranged from 0.59 to 0.50. Cultured TKB-2 cells expressed 1.1 X 10(4) binding sites/cell for MAb 15 IgG in vitro. The binding of a control antibody and the binding of its fragments to TKB-2 cells were less than 3% of the input doses. The mice with the TKB-2 tumors were given simultaneous injections of 10 microCi of 131I-labeled MAb 15 or its fragments and 10 microCi of 125I-labeled control IgG or its fragments. With MAb 15 IgG, the percentage of the injected dose bound per gram of tissue (ID/g) of the tumor was 3.68% at day 7, when the localization index (LI) was 4.38. At day 2 after MAb 15 F(ab')2 injection, 1.12% of the ID/g was localized in the tumor and the LI was 3.04. After MAb 15 Fab injection, the percentage of the ID/g of the tumor was 0.31% and the LI was 2.58 at day 1. MAb 15 IgG, F(ab')2, and Fab cleared from the blood early, with a half-life of 33, 16, and 9 hours, respectively. The distributions of MAb 15 and its fragments in the normal organs did not differ from those of the control. Radioimaging with 100 microCi of 131I-labeled MAb 15 and its fragments showed that 42%, 44%, and 32% of the total-body count were localized in the tumor with IgG at day 7, F(ab')2 at day 2, or Fab at day 1, respectively. Because the radioactivity remaining in the tumor with Fab was low, the image was insufficient. Throughout the period, less than 10% of the control IgG and its fragments remained in the tumor. Microautoradiography confirmed the binding of MAb 15 and its fragments to the tumor cells. In this study the F(ab')2 was the best compromise between the slowly cleared IgG and the poorly localized Fab in tumor imaging.\r"

  ".W": "A method has been developed for metabolic imaging on a microscopic level in tumors, tumor spheroids, and normal tissues. The technique makes it possible to determine the spatial distribution of glucose, lactate, and ATP in absolute terms at similar locations within tissues or cell aggregates. The substrate distributions are registered in serial cryostat sections from tissue cryobiopsies or from frozen spheroids with the use of bioluminescence reactions. The light emission is measured directly by a special imaging photon counting system enabling on-line image analysis. The technique has been applied to human breast cancer xenografts, to spheroids originating from a human colon adenocarcinoma, and to skeletal rat muscle. Preliminary data obtained indicate that heterogeneities in the substrate distributions measured are much more pronounced in tumors than in normal tissue. There was no obvious correlation among the three quantities measured at similar locations within the tissues. The distribution of ATP corresponded well with the histological structure of larger spheroids; values were low in the necrotic center and high in the viable rim of these cell aggregates.\r"

Although many previous studies have described the effects of certain host factors (age, nutritional status, tumor location, etc.) on experimental tumor systems, the effects of these factors on tumor angiogenesis have not been reported. In preliminary studies we inoculated cloned tumor cells id into syngeneic mice and found positional differences in tumor growth that did not correlate with measured angiogenesis levels. In addition, while tumor growth was inhibited by radiation, tumor-induced (but not fibroblast-induced) angiogenesis was not. This id system may provide an assay not only for examining the effect of host factors on tumor angiogenesis, but also for elucidation of the mechanisms underlying neovascular induction and host response.\r"

We therefore studied the effects of oral metoclopramide given at doses of 20, 50, or 100 mg four times a day for 25 doses (7 days) beginning after cisplatin to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for prophylactic oral antiemetic regimens. Patients were stratified into younger (less than or equal to 30 yr old) and older (greater than 30 yr old) groups. Dose escalation was performed without or with concomitant oral diphenhydramine. For the younger group, the MTD for metoclopramide without diphenhydramine was less than 20 mg, and the MTD with diphenhydramine was 20 mg. For the older group, the MTD without diphenhydramine was 20 mg, and the MTD with diphenhydramine was 50 mg. Extrapyramidal reactions in the younger group and agitated depression in the older group were the major dose-terminating toxic effects. Patient acceptance of these regimens was excellent.\r"

In the pilot study experimental subjects had two and a half hours of REST, during which they heard one of two differently worded anti-alcohol messages. After two weeks their alcohol intake dropped significantly from baseline levels (33% and 29%); control subjects showed no significant changes. In a replication and follow-up study experimental subjects had two and a half hours of REST, during which they heard a revised version of the most effective anti-alcohol message used in the pilot study. Two weeks later their alcohol consumption dropped 55% from baseline levels. These reductions in alcohol intake were fully sustained on follow-up three months and six months later. Untreated control subjects showed increased alcohol intake on follow-up.\r"

Research evidence suggests that these behavior disorders are associated with high levels of the trait of arousability. Highly arousable individuals often experience intense, easily aroused emotional reactions to stressful stimulation, and they are strongly predisposed toward alcohol and/or substance abuse. For these individuals, psychoactive chemicals have strongly reinforcing effects, since they alleviate unpleasant emotions associated with excessive arousal. Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) consistently lowers arousal to optimal, subjectively comfortable levels, without psychoactive chemicals. REST has demonstrated its effectiveness for alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, and obesity, all of which are associated with high arousability.\r"

The findings show that men who were charged with Battery A (the more violent offenses) were considerably more likely than those charged with Battery B to have either a drug problem or a dual alcohol and drug problem. This article concludes by suggesting the need for well-coordinated interagency treatment programs. It also documents the need for establishing valid assessment instruments that have the potential for identifying high risk chemically dependent batterers.\r"

There was strong evidence to support a dose-response relation in both the case-control and follow-up epidemiologic data. Using the dose-response curves that we calculated, the risk of breast cancer at an alcohol intake of 24 g (1 oz) of absolute alcohol daily (about two drinks daily) relative to nondrinkers was 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.8) in the case-control data and was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.2) in the follow-up data. We interpret these findings not as proof of causality, but as strongly supportive of an association between alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer.\r"

If arterial lactate concentrations continue to increase following resuscitation, the assumption that increasing lactate concentrations indicate progression of anaerobiosis due to perfusion failure would be invalidated. Lactate washout was therefore investigated in a porcine model of cardiac arrest due to electromechanical dissociation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and maintained for intervals of 30 minutes or until spontaneous circulation was restored. In 25 trials on 14 successfully resuscitated animals, the arterial blood lactate concentration decreased within four minutes after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. In 24 animals in whom resuscitation efforts failed, arterial lactate concentrations increased throughout the observation period. Lactate washout occurred during an interval of only 2.6 +/- 0.3 minutes (mean +/- SEM). These results indicate that lactate measurements are not invalidated because of a washout phenomenon under the extreme conditions of cardiac arrest.\r"

Seventy percent of patients and families were 100% willing to undergo intensive care again to achieve even one month of survival; 8% were completely unwilling to undergo intensive care to achieve any prolongation of survival. Preferences were poorly correlated with functional status or quality of life and were not altered by life expectancy for 82% of respondents. Age, severity of critical illness, length of stay, and charges for intensive care did not influence willingness to undergo intensive care. These data suggest that personal preferences may conflict with any health policy that limits the allocation of intensive care based on age, function, or quality of life.\r"

I have reviewed the experience of the committee with the 73 cases on which it provided consultation from 1974 through 1986. In addition, I have compared these cases with those of all 113 patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital who were accorded do-not-resuscitate status without OCC input during a three-month period and found that the two groups differed significantly on a number of clinical variables. I have also found that the OCC cases fall into six categories, each of which presents different ethical and legal issues. In addition, the use of the OCC within the hospital is increasing especially with regard to certain categories of cases. The committee has dealt with controversial issues in a consistent and ethically forthright manner, but legal and moral questions remain. More discussion of the role of ethics committees in withdrawal-of-care cases is needed.\r"

A physician-ethicist interviewed and examined patients, interviewed family and others as needed, and entered a formal consultation note in the medical record. The requesting physician and the consultant independently completed structured questionnaires. Fifty-one consultation requests were received from 45 physicians from seven departments between July 1, 1986, and June 30, 1987. Seventeen (33%) of 51 patients were in the intensive care unit, and 19 patients (37%) were fully oriented at the time of consultation. Overall, 61% of the patients survived to leave the hospital. The requesting physician sought assistance with withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment in 49% of cases, with resuscitation issues in 37%, and with legal issues in 31%. Assistance with more than one issue was sought in 39 cases (76%). In 36 cases (71%), the requesting physician stated that the consultation was \"very important\" in patient management, in clarifying ethical issues, or in learning about medical ethics. We conclude that ethics consultation performed by physician-ethicists provides useful, clinically acceptable assistance in a teaching hospital.\r"

This study, conducted in an internal medicine office practice, describes the ethical problems encountered in medical offices. Two hundred eighty consecutive patients, a total of 562 office visits, were prospectively evaluated. Ethical problems were defined as being present when specific ethical issues came into conflict with the physician's moral obligation to benefit the patient. The majority of the patients studied were white (214) and were women (212). The mean age of the patients was 49 years, with a range from 17 to 98 years. Ethical problems were present in 84 (30%) of the patients and in 119 (21%) of the office visits. The most common ethical problems for the patients were costs of care (11.1%), psychological factors that influence preferences (9.6%), competence and capacity to choose (7.1%), refusal of treatment (6.4%), informed consent (5.7%), and confidentiality (3.2%). Ethical problems were more common in patients over 60 years of age. This study establishes an educational as well as a research base for a broad study of biomedical ethics that looks beyond the problems encountered in the hospital.\r"

Nowadays, medical narratives tend to neglect or objectify subjective experience, including symptoms. Such narratives concentrate, in the manner of chronicles, on events in the exterior, objective world rather than the interior world of the sick. Medical students and physicians will construct more balanced accounts of human illness once they envision these accounts as \"story\", a form of narrative that traditionally accesses subjective experience as well as objective events. One can effectively begin the process of transforming medical chronicles into stories simply by asking patients what they know and how they feel about their situation and by documenting the response, using some of the patient's words, in the history of present illness. These actions will identify and preserve important information, facilitate empathy in all care givers who hear or read the history, and signal to everyone the physician's serious interest in patients as persons. Getting the voice of the patient into the history of present illness will not only help to right the medical record, but also help to right the relationship of physician and patient.\r"

Eighteen hr after induction of sepsis, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles were dissected with intact tendons and incubated for the study of protein synthesis and degradation, which were measured as incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into protein and release of tyrosine into incubation medium, respectively. Urine was collected for determination of nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance, which was equally negative in groups I and II, was significantly improved in groups III and IV and became equally positive in these groups. Protein synthesis and degradation rates in incubated EDL and SOL muscles were similar to those which we have reported previously in septic rats. Except for a higher synthetic rate in SOL in group II, no other differences in protein synthesis or degradation rates between the four experimental groups were found. Thus, the present study showed that infusion of a branched-chain amino acid-enriched solution improved nitrogen balance in septic rats. KIA alone or administered with the amino acid solution did not affect nitrogen balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initially food intake and host weight were correlated with survival of untreated rats with similar size sarcomas (45-50 cm3). TB rat food intake (r = 0.69, p less than 0.0001) and host weight (r = 0.47, p less than 0.004) correlated positively with subsequent survival. Once daily neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin treatment (2 units/100 g) significantly improved food intake (p less than 0.01) and host weight (p less than 0.01) of cachectic TB rats without increasing tumor growth. Twice daily NPH insulin (2 units/100 g) maintained normal food intake of cachectic TB rats and turned a host weight loss into a host weight gain which was significantly greater than untreated controls (p less than 0.001) and all other methods of insulin administration including once daily (p less than 0.001). Twice daily NPH insulin maintained mild hypoglycemia (glucose = 84 +/- 12 mg/dl) compared to once daily NPH insulin which resulted in hyperglycemia (glucose = 140 +/- 8 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) prior to next dose. In addition, twice daily NPH insulin did not increase tumor growth. Once daily NPH insulin for 5 days during cachectic decline was well tolerated (no treatment deaths), and improved median survival of TB rats randomized to insulin (15 days) compared to controls (13 days, p = 0.06). However, twice daily NPH insulin during cachectic decline failed to improve survival because of treatment deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The estimation of body iron stores by measurements of serum ferritin concentration assumes that the only reason for a low ferritin value is an empty iron store. The results showed that the period of hospital treatment was shorter and the number of complications, especially infections, fewer, in patients with normal as compared to empty iron stores before the operation (p less than 0.001). These differences were especially striking in patients subjected to gastric or large bowel surgery. The results were not explained by differences in sex, age, serum albumin, or clinical anemia. The complications were not predictable from preoperative serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, or alanine amino transferase levels. Among patients with postoperative complications those with preoperative empty iron stores also had a lower preoperative blood hemoglobin concentration (127 +/- 10 g/liter) than those with normal preoperative iron stores (136 +/- 9 g/liter). Thus it is speculated that the mechanisms behind postoperative complications due to preoperative empty iron stores might be a decrease in tissue oxygenation, resulting in an increased fatigue while working, decreased contractile capacity of the respiratory muscles, and a decrease in immune function. Thus a measurement of serum ferritin concentration and correction of empty iron stores is recommended before abdominal surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Various small and large molecules have been studied as osmotic agents to replace dextrose in peritoneal dialysis. Macromolecules are attractive because of their slow absorption from intraperitoneal solutions; however, it has been assumed that they are only marginally effective as osmotic agents unless they function as polyelectrolytes at physiological pH. In experimental exchanges conducted in rats we measured volume changes induced by Gelifundol (5.5% oxypolygelatin) and Ringers lactate to which was added either nothing, 4.25% dextrose, or 5% albumin. In the control exchanges using Ringers lactate, intraperitoneal fluid volume remained unchanged for eight hours. The volume changes induced by 4.25% dextrose were complete within two hours and resulted in a two-thirds increase over the amount of fluid administered. In both series in which polyelectrolytes were used volume transport was sustained throughout an eight hour dwell. With 5% albumin the total increase in fluid volume was about 40% of that installed, while Gelifundol caused fluid volume to double. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in transport studies conducted in vitro. Physical studies of the oxypolygelatin solutions indicated that the fixed charges per liter were comparable to those in the albumin solutions. Thus the different volume transport the two proteins induced could not be attributed to Donnan effects. However, since the molecular weight of albumin is triple that of Gelifundol the van't Hoff pressures of the two macromolecules can explain the observed differences in volume transport. These results suggest that neutral macromolecules deserve further study as potential osmotic agents for peritoneal dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the increased renal synthesis of thromboxane (Tx)A2 found in genetically hypertensive rats also occurred in rats with a sodium-dependent form of hypertension, the urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) and of TxB2 was measured by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay in hypertension-prone (SBH), -resistant (SBN) and unselected (SB) female rats of the Sabra strains. Rats of the three strains were studied before (9 weeks of age) and after five weeks of deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt treatment. Before treatment, the urinary 6KPGF1 alpha did not differ among the three strains while a higher TxB2 excretion was seen in the SBN rats. After treatment, the urinary excretion of TxB2 increased significantly in SBH and SB but not in SBN rats, while the urinary 6KPGF1 alpha remained unchanged in SBH, increased moderately in SB and markedly in SBN controls. Consequently, DOCA-salt-induced changes in blood pressure and in urinary 6KPGF1 alpha observed in the three strains of rats were inversely related (r = -0.78; P less than 0.001). It is concluded that the high blood pressure developed after DOCA-salt treatment in SBH rats is more likely to depend upon a defect in the renal production of prostacyclin rather than upon an increased synthesis of thromboxane A2.\r"

  ".W": "In chronic renal failure (CRF), secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) plays a major role in skeletal lesions and also probably in the deterioration of renal functions consecutive to nephrocalcinosis. In this study we tested whether WR-2721 [S-,2-(3-aminopropylamino)-ethylphosphorothioic acid], an inhibitor of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, could prevent the deleterious effects of sHPT at both the bone and kidney level in an animal model of CRF. Rats were either subtotally nephrectomized (NX) or sham-operated (SHAM). They were then pairfed a high phosphorus (1.4%), middle Ca (0.6%) diet. This regimen accelerated the deterioration of renal function in NX rats which displayed signs of severe sHPT in bone (three- to fourfold increase in osteoclast number and resorption surfaces) and kidney (sixfold increase in Ca content) after four weeks. Chronic administration of WR-2721 (20 mg = 0.093 mmol/kg s.c. twice daily) during four weeks completely prevented the progressive elevation of both plasma urea and inorganic phosphate, and the fall of plasma Ca. It also prevented kidney Ca accumulation to the same extent as parathyroidectomy. However, WR-2721 given at this dose only partially prevented the histomorphometric indices of increased bone resorption and formation. This discrepant response suggests that WR-2721 could exert an additional protective effect at the kidney level that might be related to its property of acting as a free radical scavenger. In conclusion, this study suggests that WR-2721 might be a useful compound in CRF, not only because it inhibits PTH secretion, but also because it could protect against the deleterious effect of secondary hyperparathyroidism on kidney functions.\r"

The present study was designed to examine the effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) on Na transport, proton secretion, and Ca45 flux in the turtle bladder, a high resistance membrane. When added to the mucosal solution, 1 mM HTZ had no effect on Na transport or proton secretion, but significantly increased mucosa-to-serosa Ca45 flux at 60 minutes (control 118.9 +/- 39.7 pmol/mg/60 min versus thiazide 286.0 +/- 64.9 pmol/mg/60 min, N = 16, P less than 0.02). In the presence of 5 X 10(-4) M ouabain, a maneuver which inhibits active Na transport, HTZ again significantly enhanced mucosa-to-serosa Ca45 flux. The increment of calcium transport under these conditions was 83.4 +/- 35.2 pmol/mg/60 min (N = 8, P less than 0.05). Mucosal HTZ had no effect on serosa-to-mucosa (that is, bath-to-lumen) Ca45 flux after a 60 minute incubation. Serosal addition of HTZ had no effect on either of the unidirectional Ca45 fluxes or on Na transport. Mucosal tissue Ca45 content was enhanced by HTZ (mucosal) in the presence or absence of ouabain. These results provide support for the view that thiazides have a direct stimulatory effect on calcium absorption at the luminal membrane, perhaps secondary to increased mucosal calcium permeability.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of vasopressin receptors of the V1 (vascular) type and of oxytocin receptors in the rat kidney was investigated using an autoradiographical approach. Rat kidney sections were incubated with tritiated vasopressin ([3H]vasopressin, 1.5 nM) or oxytocin ([3H]oxytocin, 3 nM). The ligand selectivity of the [3H]vasopressin binding sites detected was deduced from competition experiments using one selective unlabeled ligand for V2 (antidiuretic) vasopressin receptors (1-deamino-[8-D-arginine]-vasopressin, dDAVP) and one selective unlabeled ligand for V1 receptors (des-glycineamide-[1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid]-arginine vasopressin, des(Gly(NH2)9d(CH2)5-AVP). Specific and dense [3H]vasopressin labeling was observable in the medullopapillary and cortical portions of the kidney. Specific [3H]vasopressin binding in the cortex was insensitive to the V1-selective ligand, des(Gly(NH2)9d(CH2)5-AVP, but was inhibited by dDAVP. Glomerular structures identified as such by microscopical observation of the kidney sections were specifically labeled with [3H]oxytocin and [125I]-SAR1-angiotensin II but not with [3H]vasopressin. It is concluded that V1 receptors which have been evidenced on mesangial cells in culture are not expressed in a detectable quantity on mesangial cells in situ. The specific [3H]oxytocin binding to glomeruli might reflect the presence on glomerular structures of oxytocin receptors involved in the effects of the hormone on renal hemodynamics, and possibly in some of the effects ascribed to vasopressin.\r"

  ".W": "In order to reveal structural damage to the glomerular basement membranes occurring in crescentic glomerulonephritis and the subsequent connective tissue organization of the crescent, 14 kidney biopsies were treated with detergents to remove cellular components and the tissue remaining examined by transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. The fourteen biopsies were divided into two groups for analysis. Group I (7 cases) contained necrotizing lesions and cellular crescents. Acellular TEM (ATEM) revealed widespread lysis of mesangial matrix, while acellular SEM (ASEM) of five cases revealed three general patterns of GBM necrosis. Group II (7 cases) contained fibrocellular and fibrosis crescents. ATEM and ASEM revealed that collagen fibers initially form along fibrin fibrils and eventually result in formation of lacunar spaces occupied by cells of the crescent. Fibrous crescents were associated with prominent glomerular tuft distortion and entrapment of normal capillary loops. Continuity between interstitial space, matrix of crescent and mesangium were often observed. These observations suggest that lysis of mesangial matrix is extensive and precedes GBM lysis while the pattern of GBM damage fits best with local release of lytic factors. Furthermore, the architectural distortion and continuity which develops between normally segregated compartments (mesangial-interstitial) indicate that both the initial necrosis and the reparative response to injury, contribute substantially to overall nephron dysfunction.\r"

Forty-four pediatric patients undergoing continuous ambulatory (CAPD) or cycling (CCPD) peritoneal dialysis had bone biopsies and deferoxamine (DFO) infusion tests; all were receiving oral calcitriol. Osteitis fibrosa (OF) was found in 39%, mild lesions (M) in 25%, normal histology (NH) in 16%, aplastic lesions (AP) in 11%, and osteomalacia (OM) in 9%. Bone surface aluminum (SA) was present by histochemical staining in 10 out of 20 given aluminum-containing phosphate-binding agents and in 0 of 24 treated with calcium carbonate; chi 2 = 15.5, P less than 0.0001. Serum biochemistries and DFO infusion tests failed to predict bone histology, but plasma aluminum levels were markedly elevated and bone aluminum content was highest in patients with OM. Bone formation rate (BFR) correlated with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), r = 0.55, P less than 0.001; BFR was inversely related to bone aluminum content (r = -0.42, P less than 0.01), even in patients with OF (r = -0.66, P less than 0.05). All patients with SA greater than 30% had normal or reduced BFR when compared to those with SA less than 30%; chi 2 = 12.2, P less than 0.005. Based on SA greater than 30%, six patients were classified as aluminum-related bone disease: three OM, one AP, and two NH. Two-thirds of pediatric patients undergoing CAPD/CCPD have persistent hyperparathyroidism despite treatment with calcitriol, but aluminum can adversely affect BFR when SA exceeds 30% regardless of histologic lesion or serum PTH level.\r"

In order to investigate the extent to which the impaired erythropoietic response is determined at the progenitor cell level, we determined the frequencies of marrow colony-forming cells in 11 anemic and 3 non-anemic, dialysis-dependent ESRD patients and 10 healthy individuals. In addition, we measured serum levels of erythropoietin (Epo) by radioimmunoassay. There were no significant differences (P greater than 0.1) between normal and ESRD groups in the frequencies of primitive or late erythroid (BFU-E and CFU-E, respectively), granulocyte-macrophage, and megakaryocyte progenitors, CFU-E/BFU-E ratios, or serum Epo levels. In contrast, 5 non-uremic patients with chronic anemia comparable in severity to the anemic ESRD patients had serum Epo levels and CFU-E/BFU-E ratios that were significantly increased (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively) in comparison to the normal controls and ESRD patients. Pre-dialysis serum and plasma from both ESRD groups were as supportive of autologous erythroid and non-erythroid colony growth in vitro as normal serum and plasma; inhibition was not observed. We conclude that the relative numbers of erythroid and non-erythroid progenitors and the majority of serum Epo levels are unchanged from normal in patients with the anemia of ESRD. However, their normal CFU-E/BFU-E ratio reflects an inadequate compensatory erythropoietic response due to their inability to appropriately increase Epo production in response to anemia. Inhibitors of autologous erythroid colony formation were not detected in ESRD serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prior to treatment patients had biochemical and histological hyperparathyroidism with greatly increased bone formation rates. During treatment, plasma phosphate levels decreased from the upper to the lower limit of normal for age (pre, 1.69 +/- 0.06 mmol/liter; 6 months, 1.28 +/- 0.06 mmol/liter; 1 year, 1.34 +/- 0.06 mmol/liter; P less than 0.01). Circulating 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol rose to supranormal levels within three months and remained high throughout the period of study (pre, 96 +/- 32 pmol/liter; 6 months, 144 +/- 46 pmol/liter; 1 year, 169 +/- 53 pmol/liter; P less than 0.001). Significant falls in bone formation rate at tissue and cellular levels (P less than 0.005) and in total resorption surface (P less than 0.005) were observed. A mild mineralization defect present before treatment worsened, with a decrease in mineral appositional rate (P less than 0.01) and increase in mineralization lag time (P less than 0.01). Staining for aluminum in post-treatment biopsies was positive in 9 of 11 cases. Phosphate restriction produced suppression of biochemical and histological hyperparathyroidism and sustained elevation of circulating 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. The adverse changes in bone mineralization may be related to aluminum hydroxide therapy; calcium carbonate is therefore recommended.\r"

In addition, theophylline and phenytoin, the two drugs with the most substantial and progressive decrease in protein binding, were further studied by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fractions of ultrafiltrate of normal and uremic serum, in an attempt to identify substances causing drug protein binding inhibition. There was a marked decline of the protein binding of theophylline, phenytoin and methotrexate (dialyzed patients vs. normals: -20.1, -16.0 and -15.1%, respectively). There was a rise in the protein binding of propranolol, cimetidine and clonidine. The changes observed for diazepam, prazosin and imipramine were less marked. For phenytoin, theophylline, methotrexate and diazepam, protein binding was inversely correlated to the serum creatinine (r = 0.87, 0.80, 0.79 and 0.67, P less than 0.001), and a less pronounced but still significant positive correlation was found for clonidine (r = 0.46, P less than 0.01). Ultrafiltrate, obtained during a hemofiltration session, inhibited protein binding of theophylline and phenytoin in a dose dependent way. After separation of this ultrafiltrate by HPLC, it appeared that for both theophylline and phenytoin at least a part of this inhibitory activity corresponded to the elution zone of hippuric acid. For theophylline two other inhibitory zones were further recognized: one corresponding to the elution zone of NaCl and one in which the responsible substance remained unidentified. Hippuric acid in solution inhibited protein binding of theophylline and phenytoin in a dose dependent way. In conclusion, protein binding of several drugs currently used in renal failure is affected in parallel with renal function, which might affect the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
