There were 12 suspected masses in the 11 patients. Ten lesions were malignant, and in two lesions only nonneoplastic inflammatory tissue was found. The signal intensity (SI) of each lesion relative to that of muscle was determined visually and correlated with the histologic findings at surgery or biopsy. The SIs of malignant and benign lesions were indistinguishable. All lesions showed areas of high SI that correlated with carcinoma and tumor necrosis or with non-neoplastic inflammation and edema. Areas of low SI corresponded to reactive fibrous tissue (desmoplastic reaction) with small islands of tumor or to nonneoplastic fibrosis. MR imaging can be useful in determining the extent of suspected tumors, but SIs on T2-weighted images do not permit histologic diagnosis. In particular, distinction of benign from malignant tissue is difficult in tumors with a desmoplastic reaction.\r"

Regional, reversible myocardial ischemia was produced in rats and confirmed. After reperfusion, flow to the compromised myocardial segment returned to baseline. Normal myocardium could not be differentiated from ischemic myocardium on nonenhanced MR images (n = 12). After 5 minutes of myocardial ischemia and after administration of albumin-Gd-DTPA, the ischemic zone involving the free wall of the left ventricle was characterized by the absence of significant enhancement. Normal myocardium appeared homogeneously enhanced (by 145%). This pattern persisted for up to 1 hour of myocardial ischemia. In six rats that underwent myocardial reperfusion after 5 minutes of ischemia, the normal and reperfused myocardium became isointense. Radiotracer studies with albumin-Gd-153-DTPA confirmed the decreased distribution of contrast agent to the ischemic myocardium, possibly due to decreased blood pool or a blocked primary delivery system in the ischemic myocardium.\r"

In addition, the probe enhances the ability of the investigator to localize cardiac spectra spatially and temporally during the cardiac cycle.

Diagnostic accuracy of the two techniques was assessed objectively, and image quality was assessed subjectively. In 16 patients (62%), the radiation exposure was reduced by 50% for the imaging plate technique by decreasing the mAs level generally used for the screen-film combination. Because of the dynamic range of the imaging plate system, no repeat examinations were necessary, while 12% of the screen-film studies had to be repeated because of over- or under-penetration. Imaging plate studies required 6% more time for processing than screen-film studies. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis indicated no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two imaging techniques. Subjective evaluation also revealed no difference in observer preference for imaging plate or screen-film studies. The imaging plate technique is an excellent alternative to screen-film studies in the operating room.\r"

In all normal extremities, the injection deposit appeared homogeneous, and one to five lymph vessels could be identified. Diffusion of contrast agent into perilymphatic tissue occurred 30-40 cm proximal to the injection site; inguinal lymph nodes were, therefore, not routinely visualized. The findings at interstitial lymphangiography were abnormal in all extremities with advanced lymphedema. The results indicate that interstitial lymphangiography with the use of a nonionic dimeric contrast agent allows morphologic assessment of lymphatic vessels and facilitates the diagnosis of lymphatic obstructive disease.\r"

Because of the clinical and economic significance of the conclusions drawn from these RCTs, the authors used a standardized instrument to evaluate the quality of study design and data analysis of 100 RCTs published between 1982 and 1987 that compared LOM and HOM. The mean quality score (+/- standard deviation) was 39 +/- 12 (maximum possible score, 100). The largest number of patients studied in any RCT was 435; the smallest was five. A majority of the RCTs received high scores on three attributes of quality, intermediate scores on seven, and low scores on nine. These results underscore the difficulty of designing, performing, analyzing, and reporting high-quality RCTs. Nevertheless, limitations in study design and data analysis need to be considered when interpreting results of these RCTs. Future RCTs comparing LOM and HOM should be performed with greater attention to basic elements of good study design and data analysis.\r"

The variables used were identical to those of clinical trials, including a rotational speed of 50,000 rpm and an injection rate of 40 mL/min. The debris produced by the catheter was studied cytologically, and the arterial segments were examined histologically. The particle size in the debris ranged from 1 to 2,000 microns. The softer plaques produced a fine fibrin dust background with long strips of intima ranging from 10 to 2,000 microns. Complicated calcified plaques produced larger background material (10-120 microns) but smaller strips of intima (50-800 microns). Dissections and perforations occurred. Some of the debris produced by the atheroablation process was used to embolize a canine heart and kidney. Small focal infarctions were found in the heart, and large and multiple infarcts were seen in the kidney. In clinical studies the debris appears to be tolerated in the lower extremities. Its safety in the kidney and heart are questioned.\r"

In the occluded shunts, thrombectomy and subsequent balloon angioplasty were performed in four patients, and percutaneous recanalization with angioplasty was performed in one. One shunt with decreasing flow was percutaneously dilated. Since the underlying stenoses recurred in four patients after 24 hours and did not respond sufficiently to angioplasty in two patients, up to four stents were placed in the venous segments. Thrombosis of the stents occurred in two patients after 24 hours and in one after 6 weeks and was successfully recanalized with thrombectomy in two. At 2-6 months follow-up, the stents and the shunts were patent in five patients. In three of these patients, intima hyperplasia, associated with narrowing of the stent lumen in two, was noted within 4 months after stent placement.\r"

Mammographic patterns of DCIS were microcalcifications in 37 of 54 (68%) lesions and calcifications within a mass in 16 (30%). Multifocal DCIS, evidenced radiographically by patterns of more than one mass, more than one cluster of microcalcifications, or parallel linear, irregular intraductal calcifications, was seen in 35 of 54 (65%) breasts but only on specimen radiographs in four of these. In 22 (41%) lesions maximum tumor expanse was greater than 2.5 cm, and all were multicentric. Multicentricity of tumor and tumor size greater than 2.5 cm may indicate need for therapies more radical than simple excision. Breast irradiation has been shown to significantly diminish recurrence rates in these patients. Mammography and specimen radiography with magnification may be appropriate in these cases to identify all possible tumor sites in the involved breast.\r"

After the first treatment, a significant decrease in T2 values and signal intensity ratios of tumor to fat and tumor to muscle was found in all patients. There was no significant change in T1 values. The relative decrease in tumor size correlated well with signal intensity ratios and poorly with T2 values of the original tumor. No correlation with T1 values was found. The authors conclude that size of the residual mass can be predicted from the initial size of the tumor and the signal intensity ratios at diagnosis. Since the degree of low signal intensity in the tumor before treatment probably reflects the amount of fibrotic tissue, these results support the hypothesis that residual masses after treatment are remnants of the fibrotic stroma of the original tumor.\r"

Twenty of 96 (21%) AICD patches distorted with time. (b) Thirty-six postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans of asymptomatic patients revealed that pericardial fluid collections were frequent during the month after surgery but rare beyond that. Echocardiography was insensitive for these collections. CT also demonstrated dense fibrosis around some distorted patches, months after surgery. (c) Five other patients with pericardial infection had distorted patches, and the four studied with CT had fluid beneath their patches. (d) A case of constrictive pericarditis had distorted patches but was not diagnosed with CT. The authors conclude that distorted patches may indicate postoperative complications and that CT is the imaging modality of choice.\r"

Two algorithms for data compression are compared in application to computed tomographic (CT) images. The first, an information-preserving algorithm combining differential and Huffman encoding, allows reconstruction of the original image. A second algorithm alters the image in a clinically acceptable manner. This second algorithm combines two processes: the suppression of data outside of the head or body and the combination of differential and Huffman encoding. Because the final image is not an exact copy, the second algorithm is information losing. Application of the information-preserving algorithm can double or triple the number of CT images that can be stored on hard disk or magnetic tape. This algorithm may also double or triple the speed with which images may be transmitted. The information-losing algorithm can increase storage or transmission speed by a factor of five. The computation time on this system is excessive, but dedicated hardware is available to allow efficient implementation.\r"

These problems are manifested in both the in-plane and section-select directions. The authors show that reversal of many of these adverse effects is possible through the acquisition of the gradient field echo in a three- and four-dimensional mode for a fixed echo time (TE), since phase-encoding leads to the capture of the echo within the sampling window. This echo centering is shown to be equivalent to the reduction of dephasing across a pixel. Improvements are also obtained by reducing TE to as short a value as possible.\r"

Six subjects who terminated the examination before completion also completed exit interviews.

Anxiety was associated with the constrictive dimensions of the magnet bore, examination duration, coil noise, and temperature within the bore. Preparation at the point of referral was consistently absent, incomplete, or misleading. Patients used identifiable strategies to cope with the examination: blinding, breathing relaxation techniques, visualization of pleasant images, and performance of mental exercises.\r"

The signal intensity of 13 lesions was similar to or slightly less than that of muscle on T1-weighted images and greater than that of fat on T2-weighted images. This appearance correlated with the presence of ectatic lymphatic channels containing clear fluid on histologic section. Four lymphangiomas had high signal intensity, approximately equal to that of fat, on T1-weighted images, reflecting the presence of clotted blood or small cystic spaces with a higher ratio of fat to fluid. Sixteen of 17 lesions had visible septations on MR images. The authors' experience suggests that most lymphangiomas have a characteristic appearance on MR images. The information obtained with MR imaging can help in providing a preoperative diagnosis, in planning surgical resection, and in defining recurrence.\r"

The pars defect usually had an intermediate signal intensity with all pulse sequences; however, this intensity was somewhat variable depending on the exact ratio of cartilage, fat, and fluid within each bone defect. The pars defect was best seen with spin-echo 600/20 (repetition time msec/echo time msec) images. In three cases, out-of-phase images showed the spondylolysis best, because of extension of fat to the borders of the defect. The sagittal view allowed one to separate spondylolysis from the joint space of posterior facets since the orientation of the defects is perpendicular to the facets; thus, a common pitfall encountered with cross-sectional axial imaging techniques is avoided. MR imaging poorly delineated bone fragments around the defect, which may produce nerve root impingement, but revealed other numerous complications that occur with spondylolysis, including spondylolisthesis and herniation of the disk above.\r"

With the use of an ample spectrum of strongly T1- to T2-weighted sequences, two zones of cartilage with different signal intensities were observed in all specimens. A superficial cartilaginous layer in the MR image with higher water content and longer T1 and T2 correlated with the tangential and transitional zones of normal articular cartilage, whereas a second MR imaging zone with shorter T1 and T2 was identified in the depth of the articular cartilage. Different functional properties in pressure resistance were observed in the two layers. In early cartilage degeneration without thinning, there was increased hydration of the superficial cartilage layer. This study suggests that strongly T1- and T2-weighted images are indispensable for evaluating details in articular cartilage degeneration.\r"

For comparison, the bone density of the lumbar spine was measured with DEPR in a subset of 52 patients (33 women and 19 men). High correlation was documented between DEPR and DPA measurements of the lumbar spine. No significant relationship between bone density and age was observed, in contrast to the known relationship in healthy subjects regardless of sex, site of measurement, or measurement technique. Bone density values in the spine and the proximal femur were significantly reduced for both sexes as compared with matched normative data. Interlevel variation in lumbar vertebral density as measured with DEPR was not significantly different in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as compared with control subjects. Significant correlation between bone density determination and body weight, as well as duration of menopause, was noted, whereas duration of disease, functional status, and cumulative corticosteroid dose were not predictive. Rheumatoid arthritis did not appear to influence the relationship between DEPR and DPA measurements of the spine, and neither method nor site of measurement exhibited a consistent advantage in discriminating patients with rheumatoid arthritis from healthy control subjects.\r"

In the 40 knees that had been operated on, the proximal trochlear depth (measured 1 cm below the upper limit of the trochlear groove) was 2.74 mm +/- 1.35, in contrast to 5.94 mm +/- 1.74 in the asymptomatic subjects and 5.84 mm +/- 1.53 in the patients with symptoms but no patellar instability. Recognition of depth insufficiency in the proximal portion of the trochlea should prompt a search for patellar instability.

The first pattern indicated mild ischemia that required no surgical treatment, the second indicated ischemia with occasional superficial tissue infarction that required minor debridement, and the third pattern indicated deep-tissue and bone infarction that required amputation. The triple-phase bone scan is a useful indicator of tissue viability as early as 2 days after cold injury and appears to have a clinical role in the evaluation of frostbite injuries.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is now rapidly replacing CT as the primary imaging study for many head and neck diseases. The standard stainless steel needles used for CT-guided biopsy are unsuitable for MR-guided biopsy because significant ferromagnetic artifacts obscure the underlying anatomy. A new needle has recently been designed specifically for use with MR imaging. This needle has far less magnetic susceptibility and therefore does not cause significant image distortion. The authors describe the use of this needle in MR-guided aspiration biopsy of a variety of lesions in the head and neck.\r"

Cryomicrotome sections from and magnetic resonance images of 31 cadavers were reviewed. The immature nucleus pulposus, found up to age 2 years; the transitional nucleus pulposus, found in teenagers; and the adult nucleus pulposus were associated with an intact anulus fibrosus without tears except for small concentric or transverse tears in the periphery of the anulus fibrosus. Discoloration of the nucleus pulposus, diminishing disk height, and diminishing signal intensity were associated consistently with a radial tear of the anulus fibrosus. The severely degenerated nucleus pulposus was associated also with a radial tear or complete disruption of the anulus fibrosus. The results suggest that intervertebral disk normally progresses from the immature to the transitional to the adult nucleus pulposus. When a radial tear develops in the anulus there is shrinkage and disorganization of fibrocartilage in the nucleus pulposus and replacement of the disk by dense fibrous tissue and cystic spaces.\r"

Residue Val68, which is in van der Waals contact with the heme in Mb, has been replaced by Glu, Asp, and Asn. The changes in E degrees' and the standard entropy (delta S degrees') and enthalpy (delta H degrees') of reduction in the mutant proteins were determined relative to values for wild type; the change in E degrees' at 25 degrees C was about -200 millivolts for the Glu and Asp mutants, and about -80 millivolts for the Asn mutant. At pH 7.0, reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) in the Glu and Asp mutants is accompanied by uptake of a proton by the protein. These studies demonstrate that Mb can tolerate substitution of a buried hydrophobic group by potentially charged and polar residues and that such amino acid replacements can lead to substantial changes in the redox thermodynamics of the protein.\r"

It is reported here that isolated liver cells of two teleost toadfishes, Opsanus beta and Opsansus tau, synthesize urea by the ornithine-urea cycle at substantial rates. Because toadfish excrete ammonia, do not use urea as an osmolyte, and have substantial levels of urease in their digestive systems, urea may serve as a transient nitrogen store, forming the basis of a nitrogen conservation shuttle system between liver and gut as in ruminants and hibernators. Toadfish synthesize urea using enzymes and subcellular distributions similar to those of elasmobranchs: glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthethase (CPS III) and mitochondrial arginase. In contrast, mammals have CPS I (ammonia-dependent) and cytosolic arginase. Data on CPS and arginases in other fishes, including lungfishes and the coelacanth, support the hypothesis that the ornithine-urea cycle, a monophyletic trait in the vertebrates, underwent two key changes before the evolution of the extant lungfishes: a switch from CPS III to CPS I and replacement of mitochondrial arginase by a cytosolic equivalent.\r"

Zfy-1 alone may suffice to determine maleness; Zfy-2 is dispensable, as it was deleted in an Sxr variant that retains sex-determining function but has lost other genes. Both loci mapped near the centromere of the mouse Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes of the subspecies Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus were distinguishable by a Zfy-1 restriction fragment polymorphism, which can be used to study their differing interactions with autosomal sex-determining genes.\r"

Comparison of the refined crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.\r"

Eye movement information may feed forward from the motor control areas of the brain or feed back from the extrinsic eye muscles. Feedback signals elicited by passive eye movement selectively gate retinal outflow at the first relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The gating predominantly facilitates retinogeniculate transmission immediately after eye movement and inhibits transmission when a new steady-state eye position is achieved. These two gating effects are distributed in a complementary fashion across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus such that the spatiotemporal activity profile could contribute to object detection and localization.\r"

A computer model has been developed that simulates the migration of the molecules in a rotating-field gel electrophoresis experiment.\r"

Within the cloned region, the genes for the tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) alpha and beta and HLA-B were 210 kb apart. The human homolog of a mouse gene, B144, was located next to TNF alpha. Moreover, the presence of additional genes was suggested by a large cluster of CpG islands. With cosmid probes, several distinct transcripts were detected in RNA samples from a variety of cell lines. Altogether, five novel genes were identified by isolation of corresponding complementary DNA clones. These \"HLA-B-associated transcripts\" (BATs) were mapped to different locations within a 160-kb region that includes the genes for TNF alpha and TNF beta. The presence of the genes for BAT1 and BAT5 in the vicinity of HLA-B again raises the question of which gene in this region determines susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

To see whether efficient gene transfer and expression was feasible, rabbit aortic endothelial cells were infected with three Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vectors. Two of these vectors carry genes encoding products that are not secreted: N2, containing only the selectable marker gene neoR, and SAX, containing both neoR gene and an SV40-promoted adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. The third vector, G2N, contains a secretory rat growth hormone (rGH) gene and an SV40-promoted neoR gene. Infection with all three vectors resulted in expression of the respective genes. A high level of human ADA expression was observed in infected endothelial cell populations both before and after selection in G418. G2N-infected rabbit aortic endothelial cells that were grown on a synthetic vascular graft continued to secrete rGH into the culture medium. These studies suggest that endothelial cells may serve as vehicles for the introduction in vivo of functioning recombinant genes.\r"

Solution of this problem was hypothesized to involve the creation and mental rotation of an imagined movement vector from the direction of the light to the direction of the movement. This hypothesis was tested directly by recording the activity of cells in the motor cortex during performance of the task and computing the neuronal population vector in successive time intervals during the reaction time. The population vector rotated gradually counterclockwise from the direction of the light to the direction of the movement at an average rate of 732 degrees per second. These results provide direct, neural evidence for the mental rotation hypothesis and indicate that the neuronal population vector is a useful tool for \"reading out\" and identifying cognitive operations of neuronal ensembles.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence and patterns of same-gender sexual contact among men are key components of models of the spread of HIV infection and AIDS in the U.S. population. Previous estimates by Kinsey et al. from data collected between 1938 and 1948 have been widely criticized for inadequacies of sample design. New lower-bound estimates of prevalence developed from data from a national sample survey conducted in 1970 indicate that minimums of 20.3 percent of adult men in the United States in 1970 had sexual contact to orgasm with another man at some time in life; 6.7 percent had such contact after age 19; and between 1.6 and 2.0 percent had such contact within the previous year. Although these estimates incorporate adjustments for missing data, the likelihood of underreporting suggests that these estimates might be lower bounds on the prevalence of same-gender sex among men. Two sets of alternative estimates are derived to assess the sensitivity of these estimates to the assumptions made in imputing values to missing data. Detailed estimates are presented by frequency of contact, age, education, and marital status; and supporting estimates are derived from a 1988 national survey. Data from both the 1970 and 1988 surveys indicate that never-married men are more likely than other men to have had same-gender sexual contacts within the last year. The 1970 survey also indicates, however, that approximately half the men estimated to have such contacts are found among the more numerous population of currently or previously married men.\r"

The role of feeding male ticks, which emit an aggregation-attachment pheromone, in attracting unfed ticks to cattle was investigated. Calves infested with feeding male ticks were more attractive to unfed adult ticks than were uninfested calves. The presence of the pheromone on previously infested cattle apparently allows unfed ticks to discriminate between hosts on which these parasites have fed successfully (suitable hosts) and those on which they have not (potentially unsuitable hosts). The use of acaricides is thus unlikely to reduce bont tick populations in areas where adequate numbers of alternate (wild) hosts are present. Also, cattle so treated may lose their resistance to heartwater through lessened exposure to infected ticks.\r"

Because platelet activating factor (PAF) participates in the inflammatory process, the effect of a PAF-specific antagonist, BN52021, on the ovulatory response was tested in rats. BN52021, administered locally, inhibited follicle rupture in rats stimulated to ovulate with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In addition to suppressing rupture of the follicles, this antagonist suppressed the hCG-stimulated increase in ovarian collagenolysis and vascular permeability. The inhibition of ovulation of BN52021 could be reversed by simultaneous administration of PAF. Furthermore, PAF partially reversed the blockage of ovulation by inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of PAF in ovulation. Its role seems to be closely related to the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Thus, modulation of PAF action may serve as an additional target for regulation of reproduction via its action on ovulation.\r"

RNA blot analysis verified that the abundance of the transcripts arising from these genes oscillates with a period of 21.5 hours in a clock wild-type strain and 29 hours in the long-period clock mutant strain frq7. Genetic mapping through the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms shows the two genes, ccg-1 and ccg-2, to be unlinked.

This relation has now been investigated with [3H]thymidine autoradiography to determine the time of cell birth and with a culture system that allows the testing of the developmental potential of cells isolated from the chick embryo retina. Contrary to the situation in vivo, where neuronal differentiation always precedes photoreceptor differentiation, photoreceptor differentiation occurs prematurely and precedes neuronal differentiation when precursor cells are isolated from the retina at early embryonic stages. Thus, cells born by embryonic day 5 (ED-5) give rise predominantly to photoreceptors when isolated for culture on ED-6 but develop mainly as neurons when isolated on ED-8. This suggests that retinal precursor cells retain after terminal mitosis the capacity to develop either as neurons or as photoreceptors. Moreover, photoreceptor differentiation appears to represent a constitutive or \"default\" pathway that precursor cells follow in the absence of neuron-inducing signals.\r"

The hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of adrenalectomized animals exhibited normal electrophysiological responses to afferent stimulation, whereas responses evoked in the dentate gyrus were severely attenuated. Corticosterone replacement prevented both the adrenalectomy-induced granule cell loss and the attenuated physiological response.

  ".W": "The recent changes in the mechanisms of health care funding have complicated trauma care and trauma center development. Hard data are needed on the current financial position of trauma care to plan for the future. To reduce the cost of trauma care without sacrificing the quality, we must know how the trauma dollar is spent. We reviewed the records of 100 random admissions to the trauma service of our institution in 1985. The records were examined for length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), total hospital bill, types of third-party coverage, and overall collection rate. The hospital bill was broken down to identify the origins of trauma costs. To provide a control group, 100 patients admitted to the general surgical service and 100 other admissions were also analyzed. Trauma patients had greater LOS, ICU-LOS, total bills, and costs per day. Blunt trauma resulted in a greater LOS than penetrating trauma, but similar total bills. The collection rate from the blunt trauma patients was significantly greater. The greatest differences between trauma patients and others in resource utilization are the result of longer ICU-LOS and greater use of blood products. We did not identify any sites of potentially significant cost cutting that would not compromise patient care.\r"

Satisfaction scores were compared between HMO and private care groups by multivariate analysis of variance. Satisfaction with the doctor-patient relationship and convenience of care was higher in the private care group, whereas satisfaction with cost was higher in the HMO group. Interestingly, the HMO group evaluated private care and HMO care similarly. The private group rated HMO care less favorably.

Thirty day postoperative mortality rates were zero per cent for the esophagectomy group, 25.0 per cent for the stoma group and 33.3 per cent for the bypass group. When calculated from the date of diagnosis, the one and two year survival rates and the median survival time were 50.2 and 16.7 per cent and 296 days for the esophagectomy group, 16.7 and zero per cent and 196 days for the bypass group, 25.0 and zero per cent and 142 days for the stoma group and zero per cent and 142 days for the group who did not undergo surgical treatment. Complication related postoperative deaths occurred in 14.8 per cent of the 27 patients operated upon. For those in the esophagectomy group, it was 5.9 per cent, and for the bypass group, 50.0 per cent. Swallowing was improved in 58.8 per cent after esophagectomy, but in none of the patients was swallowing restored after the bypass procedures. When the invasion spared the aorta or major respiratory tract, postoperative survival time after esophagectomy was significantly better. Considering the short postoperative survival time and frequent complications, bypass procedure should not be the final resort after nonsurgical treatment.\r"

Precautions regarding operative technique for the placement of the catheter include incisions through healthy skin, maintenance of aseptic technique at the site of access, an atraumatic subcutaneous tunnel at least 25 centimeters in length and a long acting local analgesic effect. Catheters were in situ for a total of 2,215 days (a mean of 111 days per catheter). Catheters were also used to administer intravenously medications, blood and blood products, chemotherapeutic agents, parenteral nutrition and for sampling of blood. Four complications occurred: one instance each of catheter sepsis and infection of the subcutaneous tract and two of thromboses of the IVC. No deaths occurred. The complication rate was 0.18 per cent per catheter-day. Long term access to the IVC is feasible without undue concern in conditions in which access to the SVC is precluded but long term central access is essential.\r"

Thirty-six met the criteria for study. Twenty men and 16 women with an average age of 55.4 years were identified. Myeloproliferative disorders were the most predominant cause of massive splenomegaly. Pancytopenia and hemolytic complications of the disease processes were the most acute indications for operations. The average time between diagnosis and operative intervention was 42 months. An average of 10 units of blood products were required to correct preoperative coagulopathy. Eleven of 36 patients had postoperative complications. Eight of 21 with drains and an equal number of patients with preliminary splenic arterial ligation had complications. Eight-one per cent of all complications were infection related. Complication increased the length of stay 11 days. The 30 day mortality rate was 11.1 per cent. Sepsis was the major cause of mortality. Closed drainage system provided no demonstrable benefit nor appeared to be the cause of sepsis. No episodes of pulmonary embolic phenomenon or peripheral venous thrombosis were demonstrated. Elective splenectomy in patients with smaller spleens was performed without operative mortality and with 3 per cent morbidity rate. For patients with massive splenomegaly, the average survival time was 28.5 months. The majority of these patients died from complications of the disease. Preoperative coagulopathy, failure to demonstrate a hematologic response to splenectomy and reoperation were clear predictors for decreased long term survival periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The immediate and long term effects of hemorrhagic shock without tissue injury on the susceptibility of an animal to infection and the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection in this setting were examined. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock (LD15) by bleeding to a mean arterial pressure of 45 millimeters of mercury for 45 minutes and were resuscitated with shed blood and normal saline solution. In one experiment, dorsal wounds were inoculated one hour before or after shock with either 10(6), 10(8) or 10(10) Staphylococcus aureus. In a second experiment, rats were infected at one hour, or one, three or five days after shock with 10(6), 10(7) or 10(8) S. aureus. Equivalent numbers of rats received cefamandole nafate prior to bacterial challenge. Hemorrhagic shock increased the susceptibility to wound infection at all inocula. Infection increased whether rats were wounded before or after shock, and this effect was sustained for up to three days. Antibiotic prophylaxis was of limited value in reducing the incidence of wound infection after shock.\r"

  ".W": "Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) has been extensively used as a model of sepsis in adult rats. It is not known if the response to sepsis is similar in young and adult rats. This investigation was done to compare hemodynamic and metabolic alterations in young (four to six weeks of age, 60 to 90 grams) and adult (12 to 14 weeks of age, 270 to 340 grams) rats after CLP. In one series of experiments, survival rate was determined for 96 hours, and in other experiments, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, plasma glucose, lactate, amino acids, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood and peritoneal cultures and resting energy expenditure (REE) were determined eight and 16 hours after CLP. Levels of glycogen in liver and muscle were determined 16 hours after CLP. Mortality rate was similar in young and adult rats. MAP was stable throughout the course of sepsis, with no significant differences between the two groups of rats. HR was higher in young rats at all times studied. The adult rats became hyperglycemic after CLP while the young were hypoglycemic eight hours after CLP but normalized at 16 hours. Plasma lactate and BUN were similar in the two groups of rats, and no alterations were seen during sepsis. Both young and adult rats became hypoaminoacidemic after CLP. The phenylalanine to tyrosine ratio increased in a similar manner during sepsis in both experimental groups. REE was higher in young than in adult rats, but no significant changes were observed during the course of sepsis in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The remaining 25 had palliative surgical treatment, either a gastric or biliary bypass, and are not included in the present study. Three of the 78 patients who underwent pancreatic resection died, and ten patients required early reoperation. Predictive criteria could be formulated for the prognosis and outcome of the patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. The most reliable index for survival time of the patients proved to be the radicality of the resection, which was directly related to the differentiation of the primary tumor. Forty-three of 48 patients who underwent radical resection are alive, with a survival time ranging from three to 49 months. Eleven of 23 patients who underwent palliative resection are alive, with a survival time ranging from two to 29 months. Of 44 patients with well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma who underwent radical resection, 38 are alive, with a survival time ranging from six to 41 months (mean of 29 months).\r"

All of the patients survived, and the only morbidity was one instance of transient vocal cord paresis. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for carotid body tumors.

Rabbit hearts were perfused via a modified Langendorff technique, monitored for developed pressure (DP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) via an isovolumic left ventricular balloon catheter, and placed in a Brucker NMR magnet (4.7 tesla) to measure phosphocreatine (PCr), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and pH. Hearts underwent 1 hour of global ischemia at 7 degrees, 17 degrees, 27 degrees and 37 degrees C initiated by one dose of K+ cardioplegia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. After reperfusion, DP (expressed as a percentage of preischemic control) and LVEDP (mm Hg) in 7 degrees and 17 degrees C hearts were no different (96 + 5% vs 97 +/- 3%; 5 +/- 2 mm Hg vs 6 +/- 2 mm Hg; p = NS), but were better (p less than 0.01) than 27 degree hearts (72 +/- 6%, 17 +/- 6 mm Hg) and 37 degree hearts (31 +/- 7%, 60 +/- 6 mm Hg). PCr was severely depleted in all groups. ATP was 90 +/- 7% and 87 +/- 5% of preischemic control in the 7 degree and 17 degree hearts, which was significantly better than the 68 +/- 3% and 21 +/- 3% in the 27 degree and 37 degree groups (p less than 0.01). The pH at end ischemia was 6.83, 6.89, 6.54, and 5.86 for the 7 degree, 17 degree, 27 degree, and 37 degree hearts, respectively (7 degrees vs 27 degrees or 37 degrees, p less than 0.01; 17 degrees vs 27 degrees or 37 degrees, p less than 0.01). Linear regression of DP on end-ischemic ATP (EIATP) and end-ischemic pH revealed: DP = 0.96 (EIATP) + 20 (r = 0.92) and DP = 60 (pH) -317 (r = 0.86). We conclude that (1) end-ischemic ATP predicts recovery of ventricular function, and, furthermore, there appears a threshold ATP concentration (80% of control) below which full recovery of function will not occur; (2) end-ischemic pH predicts recovery of ventricular function; (3) 7 degrees C hypothermic ischemia does not cause a clinically significant cold injury; and (4) in a single-dose crystalloid cardioplegia model, end-ischemic pH is linearly related to recovery of function (r = 0.86).\r"

We present a patient who was referred to us after curative resection of two abdomino-pelvic malignancies, external beam irradiation to the abdomen and pelvis, and multiple later operations for bowel obstruction and dehiscence of intestinal anastomoses. The bowel obstruction and anastomotic dehiscence occurred during the present hospitalization and resulted finally in the development of a high-output proximal jejunal fistula. The area of stricture, as seen by means of barium contrast, had two separate components with an associated acute angulation.

In a 6-year period, there were 37 local treatment failures with 16 deaths, and an additional 20 patients died without local recurrence. Pathologic data were available for 272 patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that the pathologic features in an invasive tumor most predictive for local recurrence were the combination of a high proportion of intraduct carcinoma with extensive necrosis (comedocarcinoma). Of 18 patients with these features, nine have had early local recurrence (a risk of 50% with these features vs 10% in those without), and four have died (a risk of 22% against 12%). Despite the short follow-up, the results already appear significant, and the study is ongoing. The importance of comedonecrosis in the intraduct component as a prognostic indicator in invasive carcinoma of the breast is not widely recognized and might constitute a relative contraindication to conservative treatment of the breast.\r"

However, the anatomy is not satisfactory in 30% of cases for adequate drainage of the left side of the liver. To further clarify this surgically important area, 107 vasculobiliary casts were reviewed with regard to the anatomy and relationship between the left biliary ductal and left portal venous systems. In cases in which anatomy is unfavorable for adequate drainage by anastomosis to the left hepatic duct in the hilum, several options are available. The anterior portion of the main portal fissure may be opened to gain wide access to the superior aspect of the biliary plate and reach a posterior duct that is more suitable for anastomosis. An anastomosis to an anterior duct may also be possible with this approach. If left portal ducts are inaccessible by division of the main portal fissure because of a retroportal location, then an anastomosis in the anterior portion of the umbilical fissure may give adequate drainage. Therefore a cholangiogram is imperative before any anastomosis in the hilum or the anterior portion of the umbilical fissure.\r"

Postoperatively, fatigue increased (p less than 0.001) from 3.0 +/- 0.5 to 5.3 +/- 0.5 arbitrary units (mean +/- SEM). Heart rate, plasma catecholamines, and serum growth hormone, lactate, alanine, and glycerol values always increased, whereas serum insulin values decreased in response to exercise (p less than 0.01). During exercise, only heart rate (p less than 0.01) and lactate (p less than 0.05) values were higher postoperatively compared with preoperatively. Increase in fatigue postoperatively correlated significantly to increase in heart rate (p less than 0.01) and correlated positively, but not significantly, to increase in plasma levels of noradrenaline (p = 0.08), growth hormone (p = 0.09), and alanine (p = 0.08) during exercise, but not to increase in serum lactate values (p greater than 0.8). Thus, after uncomplicated surgery, there was increased fatigue and amplified metabolic and cardiovascular response to a given absolute work load. These findings are similar to those observed during detraining and suggest a therapeutic role of exercise in the treatment of postoperative fatigue.\r"

Median age was 76 years and three quarters were more than 72 years of age. Insertion of an endoprosthesis with or without a sphincterotomy relieved jaundice in 94% and settled cholangitis in 90%. Antibiotic cover during the procedure seems essential inasmuch as pyrexia and septicemia occurred in 6 of 57 cases where it was not given. One case was lethal. Another patient died of acute pancreatitis. The patients were old. One quarter died before the follow-up, 1 to 5 years after the initial intervention. The results indicate that the combination of endoscopic sphincterotomy, insertion of an endoprosthesis, and, if feasible, stone extraction on a later occasion when the acute phase of the illness had subsided brought the disease sufficiently under control among three quarters of the patients with large common duct stones or stenoses in the biliary tract. One quarter of the patients were treated surgically. This was accomplished without mortality, but morbidity was not negligible. A policy with a surgical approach restricted to selected cases with persistent symptoms in spite of sufficient endoscopic drainage is recommended.\r"

  ".U": "89100671\r", 
  ".W": "Controversy persists over the best choice of fluid to use for resuscitation. A number of published articles promote the use of either colloid or crystalloid fluids. Most of the arguments for use of one fluid or the other are based on cardiopulmonary data collected during and after fluid resuscitation. Although many studies report the mortality rate of patients treated with both fluids, none have critically analyzed this most important aspect of therapy. Meta-analysis is a relatively new statistical method whereby data from a number of clinical trials can be pooled to produce more reliable data. In this study meta-analysis was used to pool mortality data from reports of eight previously published, randomized, clinical trials, in which the efficacy of crystalloid and colloid fluid resuscitation was compared. The overall treatment effect when the data from all the clinical trials were pooled showed a 5.7% relative difference in mortality rate in favor of crystalloid therapy. When the data from only those studies using trauma patients were pooled, the overall treatment effect showed a 12.3% difference in mortality rate in favor of crystalloid therapy. However, when data from studies that used nontrauma patients were pooled, there was a 7.8% difference in mortality rate in favor of colloid treatment. In patients with trauma who are septic and in whom the capillary leak syndrome leads to adult respiratory distress syndrome, it may be assumed that colloid resuscitation would be no better than crystalloid resuscitation. In this study the meta-analysis of published data showed that this form of treatment is deleterious. In patients who are nonseptic or having elective surgery, however, the basement membrane is intact, and meta-analysis of data in this setting showed that treatment with colloids would be efficacious.\r"

The psychiatric symptomatology was evaluated by use of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-56), a self-rating symptom scale. The patients with verified HPT had the highest mean HSCL score, 89.1 +/- 20.1 before surgery, compared with 76.6 +/- 17.0 (p less than 0.01) in the health survey hypercalcemic patients and 73.8 +/- 16.0 (p less than 0.001) in the controls. The factors for anxiety, depression, and cognitive symptoms were the most pronounced in the HPT patients and were also increased among the mildly hypercalcemic persons of the health survey, compared with the controls. Somatic symptoms such as headache, back pain, chest pain, and weakness were equally common in HPT and in the controls, and measurements of isometric muscle strength of knee extension did not demonstrate reduction of muscle strength in the health survey hypercalcemic patients. Follow-up of the HPT patients 1 year after parathyroid surgery revealed a marked improvement in mental health (HSCL score 73.2 +/- 13.7, p less than 0.001). In the health survey hypercalcemic patients, neither the psychiatric symptomatology nor the muscle strength were influenced by 6 months of oral vitamin D therapy (alphacalcidol). The results demonstrate that psychiatric symptoms are experienced frequently by patients with HPT and minimum to moderate increases in the serum calcium level and that these disturbances are reversed by parathyroid surgery.\r"

The vascular perfusate was composed of a modified Krebs' buffer solution that contained washed human red blood cells (hematocrit, 15% to 20%) and 3% albumin, with no added hormones or peptides. Ileal blood flow was held constant at 49.3 +/- 3.1 ml/min per 100 gm wet weight of intestine. Net intestinal water and electrolyte fluxes were calculated by means of an isosmotic buffer that contained carbon-14 polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable volume marker. Viability of this isolated perfused ileal preparation was confirmed on the basis of light microscopy, oxygen consumption, and transmucosal potential difference measurements. Control experiments, without exogenous hormone infusion, resulted in a stable preparation with a basal secretory state. Intra-arterial serotonin at 2.5 micrograms/min (n = 10) significantly stimulated secretion of H2O, Na+, and Cl- (p less than 0.01). Intra-arterial substance P at 2.5 x 10(-1) micrograms/min (n = 7) significantly increased the secretion of H2O, Na+, and Cl- (p less than 0.02). The dose of serotonin was designed to yield serotonin levels that resembled those found circulating in patients with carcinoid syndrome. These data indicate that serotonin and substance P are potent secretagogues in a mammalian system, independent of their effect on mesenteric blood flow and in the absence of extra-intestinal hormonal and neural influences.\r"

  ".W": "The stainless steel cannula inserting method was used to investigate the blocking effects of nimodipine on vascular responses to intraluminal administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or potassium chloride (KCl) before and after application of abluminal blood containing thrombin in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries. A transient elevation of perfusion pressure was observed initially, and during the course of the experiment the perfusion pressure gradually increased. Nimodipine significantly depressed both transient and prolonged changes of perfusion pressure. Dose-dependent vasoconstriction induced by 5-HT was significantly enhanced, while that evoked by KCl was significantly attenuated for up to 8 hours after the application of blood. Pretreatment with nimodipine inhibited vasoconstriction to 5-HT less effectively than to KCl both before and after application of blood. The proportion of the 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction, which was sensitive to nimodipine, was reduced after application of blood, while no such change was observed in the responses to KCl. It is suggested that the augmentation of cerebrovascular responses to 5-HT in the early stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage may be mediated mainly by changes in intracellular calcium utilization rather than by the increase of calcium influx through nimodipine-sensitive channels.\r"

With minimal surgical invasion, we used either the opening of the craniopharyngeal duct to access the chiasmatic cistern or the suture between the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones to access the interpeduncular cistern. With our method, 0.5 ml contrast medium injected into three rabbits was determined roentgenographically to remain in the basal cistern; histologically, all the brain tissue remained intact. Intracisternal injection of 0.5 ml physiological saline into five rabbits had no effect on the cardiovascular system. In 23 rabbits, injection of 0.5 ml 0.1% prostaglandin F2 alpha led to a variety of electrocardiographic changes, including sinus bradycardia (in 43.5%), premature atrial contractions (in 17.4%), and premature ventricular contractions (in 39.1%). In 15 rabbits with severe changes, arrhythmia was followed by ST depression (in 30.4%), ST elevation (in 8.7%), T wave inversion (in 4.3%), ventricular tachycardia (in 17.4%), or ventricular fibrillation (in 4.3%). Intracisternal injection of 0.5 ml 1.0% lidocaine into the 23 rabbits was very effective in overcoming bradycardia and arrhythmias. We conclude that the clinical features of electrocardiographic changes seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are reproducible in this rabbit model.\r"

Cerebral ischemia was achieved with bilateral carotid artery occlusion and controlled hypotension to a mean of 50 torr for 10 minutes. Perfusion-fixation was performed 7 days after ischemia, subsequent to which the brains were sectioned coronally and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Ischemic neuronal injury was quantitatively expressed (after direct counting) as a percentage of total neurons, that is, ischemic neurons divided by (ischemic neurons + normal neurons). Predictably, the selectively vulnerable hippocampal areas exhibited the most marked neuronal injury. In the CA1/CA2 sectors, lidocaine-treated rats demonstrated less injury (34 +/- 14%) than untreated (64 +/- 9%) or saline-treated (70 +/- 10%) rats. However, these superficially pronounced numerical differences were not of statistical significance (p greater than 0.05). In the CA3 sector, neuronal injury in lidocaine-treated rats (31 +/- 14%) was significantly different at p less than 0.05 from the untreated (80 +/- 5%) but not the saline-treated (59 +/- 13%) group. We conclude that lidocaine may have an only marginal beneficial effect on forebrain ischemia in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Stroke mortality has been falling rapidly in this country since 1973. To investigate age-race-sex effects on stroke mortality, we studied US vital statistics during 1950-1972 and 1973-1981 in 55-64-, 65-74-, and 75-84-year-old race-sex groups. The accelerated rate of decline in stroke mortality since 1973 has had a substantial public health impact, with greater than 200,000 fewer stroke deaths than would otherwise have occurred. For all groups, stroke mortality declined at a greater rate (p less than 0.05) in 1973-1981 than during 1950-1972. The rates of decline during 1973-1981 were greater with increasing age (p less than 0.05) and were more substantial for younger blacks. There were no consistent differences in the rate of decline by sex. The greater rate of decline in absolute stroke mortality in the older age groups and blacks was explained by higher baseline mortality in these groups. Overall, stroke mortality decreased by approximately 2%/yr in 1950-1972 and by approximately 7%/yr after 1973. Rank order of average annual percent decline after 1973 by age-race-sex groups did not correspond to rates of change in treatment or control of hypertension obtained from three national surveys. The accelerated rate of decline after 1973 may have resulted from improved antihypertensive therapy, but our findings fail to confirm this hypothesis and suggest that treatment of hypertension may not be the principal reason for the decline in stroke mortality.\r"

Blacks comprised only 4.6% of the patients having carotid endarterectomy even though they comprised 26% of all patients discharged and 22% of the general population of the state. Data from the National Inpatient Profile of the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities, which represents patients discharged from short-term, nonfederal hospitals throughout the United States, show that nationwide, blacks comprise only 2.7% of the patients having carotid endarterectomy, whereas they comprise 12.0% of all patients discharged, 12.1% of the general population, and 10.7% of patients discharged following Class I surgical procedures. Blacks have only 67 carotid endarterectomies per 100,000 patients discharged; this rate is five or more times higher in whites. Among black patients having carotid endarterectomy, women predominate, whereas men predominate among white patients having carotid endarterectomy (p = 0.006). The underrepresentation of blacks among patients having carotid endarterectomy lends support to the concept that carotid vascular disease in blacks is distributed intracranially rather than extracranially as opposed to the extracranial rather than intracranial distribution in whites.\r"

Sixty patients had symptoms of transient ischemic carotid artery disease, and 63 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease served as controls. Antiplatelet treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was taken by 53 of the 123 patients. In 36 of the 60 symptomatic patients, platelet scintigraphy was repeated 3-4 days after carotid endarterectomy. Comparison of different scintigraphic parameters (platelet accumulation index and percent of the injected dose of labeled platelets at the carotid bifurcation) showed no significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and the severity of stenosis and the presence of plaque ulceration also had no influence on the parameters. There was no difference between patients with a short (less than 4 weeks) or long (greater than 4 weeks) interval from the last transient ischemic attack to scintigraphy and no difference between patients with or without antiplatelet treatment. Classifying the patients according to plaque morphology judged by high-resolution real-time ultrasonography also demonstrated no differences. No significant correlation was found between any scintigraphic parameter and other platelet function parameters such as platelet survival time, platelet turnover rate, and concentration of platelet-specific proteins. Quantification of platelet deposition after carotid endarterectomy in 36 patients demonstrated a significant increase of the median platelet accumulation index and the percent injected dose index. There were no significant differences between patients receiving high-dose (1.0 g/day) or low-dose (1.0 g/day) acetylsalicylic acid in scintigraphic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the possibility that this is due to a sex difference in the inhibitory effect of aspirin on platelet behavior, we studied whole-blood platelet aggregation in men and women and in male patients with carcinoma of the prostate receiving hormone therapy. The in vitro inhibitory effect of aspirin on so-called spontaneous platelet aggregation induced by stirring whole blood and monitored by the decrease in the number of singleton platelets was greater in men (mean +/- SD inhibitory ratio 1.54 +/- 0.30 in men, 1.23 +/- 0.22 in women; p less than 0.001). The inhibitory effect of aspirin was reduced in orchiectomized male patients and was restored by the addition of testosterone to blood samples. Estradiol had no detectable influence on the inhibitory effect of aspirin. Testosterone thus seems to influence platelet aggregation and its inhibition by aspirin as assessed by whole-blood in vitro aggregometry. Possible mechanisms for this effect of testosterone and its relevance to the choice of antithrombotic therapy are discussed.\r"

Patients receiving no antithrombotic drugs demonstrated increased platelet dense body secretion without an associated increase in platelet aggregation, thus raising the possibility that dense body secretion may be of separate importance in cerebral infarction. Our results also suggest that dense body secretion may occur independently of aggregation. Heparin and heparin plus warfarin were ineffective in reducing the high level of dense body secretion seen in acute cerebral infarction, whereas treatment with aspirin plus dipyridamole inhibited both dense body secretion and platelet aggregation. It seems worthwhile to investigate the usefulness of antiplatelet drugs in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke wherein clinical outcome is correlated with the extent of suppression of platelet dense body secretion.\r"

All-cause mortality rates for the drug-treated and placebo-treated groups were 25.4 and 22.7 deaths per 1,000 participant-years of risk, and rates for definite \"first stroke\" were 8.3 and 12.8 per 1,000 years of risk. Differences between groups were significant for systolic and diastolic blood pressure but not for death or stroke rates.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) was also monitored, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured. The relation between rCBF and mean velocity was dependent on the rCBF level; the correlation was strong if rCBF was less than 20 ml/100 g/min but weak if rCBF was greater than that level. Ipsilateral EEG suppression was related to a rCBF threshold of 9 ml/100 g/min and to a mean velocity threshold of 15 cm/sec; the rCBF threshold was more specific for EEG change. Postischemic hyperemia was evident in measurements of mean velocity but not of rCBF. These disparities between mean velocity and rCBF seemed to be due to three factors: 1) disproportionately high mean velocity in patients with stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, 2) a nonlinear relation between mean velocity and rCBF, and 3) the anatomically different regions of the brain in which mean velocity and rCBF are measured. The velocity measurement appeared to be relatively more sensitive than rCBF to hemodynamic events in the corpus striatum and internal capsule.\r"

The average daily incidence of stroke was about twice as great on relatively warm days as on relatively cold ones. This increase may be explained by increases in thromboembolic mechanisms secondary to physiologic changes in response to heat. When heat waves are predicted, information on the added risk for stroke needs to be disseminated to both the population and to health care providers so preventive measures can be instituted. Special attention should be devoted to air conditioning and adequate consumption of liquids, and antiplatelet aggregation medication such as aspirin should be considered.\r"

In vivo dialysis of the hippocampus was used to determine changes in extracellular concentrations of extracellular calcium and amino acids and blood-brain barrier permeability. Ischemia without treatment produced a rapid disappearance of electroencephalographic activity, a decrease in the concentration of extracellular calcium, the release of neuroactive amino acids, and leakage of methionine to the tissue fluid, plus a significant increase of the blood-brain barrier permeability to fluorescein. Except for permeability and electroencephalographic activity, these parameters normalized during 45 minutes of recirculation; permeability and activity failed to normalize completely during 3 hours of recirculation. After 3 hours of recirculation, morphologic changes in the CA1 hippocampal area were observed. Treatment with nimodipine significantly enhanced electroencephalographic activity recovery and normalization during recirculation, reduced the decrease in extracellular calcium concentration, and prevented the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Nimodipine protected the CA1 area from early morphologic changes and reduced leakage of methionine from brain cells. The beneficial cytoprotective effect of nimodipine, probably related to normalization of calcium homeostasis and blood-brain barrier permeability after ischemia, may reflect both vascular and cellular sites of action.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that transient cerebral ischemia induces marked decreases in concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins and have suggested putative involvement of calpain in the decrease of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) content. We examine the effect of nilvadipine, a new calcium channel blocker, on protein degradation in gerbil brains after 5 minutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and compare this effect with those of nimodipine and nicardipine. By densitometric quantification of the electrophoretically separated soluble proteins, mean +/- SEM MAP2 content in the hippocampus (14.4 +/- 1.8 micrograms/mg protein) was depleted (5.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/mg, p less than 0.01) 4 days after ischemia; this depletion was significantly inhibited by 1 or 10 mg nilvadipine/kg/day. MAP2 content was also depleted in vitro when normal nonischemic brain extract was incubated with calcium, but this degradation was not inhibited by the calcium channel blockers. Our results suggest that calcium channel blockers do not act directly on calpain but act at the calcium channels of neurons and may suppress activation of the enzyme and attenuate ischemic degradation of cytoskeletal protein. We found nilvadipine to be the most potent drug among those studied, and we believe it could be useful for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Choline concentration is rate limiting in the synthesis of acetylcholine. There is a negative arteriovenous difference for choline concentration across the brain, indicating the steady output of choline from this organ. Cerebral ischemia may increase extracellular choline concentration by interfering with its removal by the circulation and by enhancing its net production from phospholipids. We tested this hypothesis in six rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. We determined choline and acetylcholine output from the ischemic cerebral cortex by analyzing their concentrations in the fluid contained in cortical cups by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mean +/- SEM choline output over 40 minutes before ischemia (baseline value) was 31.1 +/- 1.6 pmol/min/cm2. During ischemia, mean +/- SEM choline output rose to 100.8 +/- 13, 97.3 +/- 12.7, 100 +/- 22.4, and 93.1 +/- 16.9 pmol/min/cm2 in four consecutive 10-minute periods, respectively. Mean +/- SEM acetylcholine output was 15.6 +/- 1.1 before and 5.9 +/- 1.2, 8.3 +/- 2.6, 8.6 +/- 2.1, and 13.7 +/- 4.6 pmol/min/cm2 in the four 10-minute collection periods during ischemia. All four choline values and the first acetylcholine value during ischemia were significantly different from their respective baseline values. We conclude that ischemia induces an increase in extracellular choline concentration with possible implications for acetylcholine metabolism. The attending transient decline in acetylcholine output may be due to impaired release due to local hypoxia or to decreased acetylcholine synthesis.\r"

Our results indicate that tetramethylpyrazine can increase survival rate only if it is administered before the induction of cerebral ischemia. Since we administered the drug intraperitoneally, it is possible that pretreatment was necessary to increase its effective concentration in the blood.

Without standardized cutoffs, each laboratory must develop its own cutoff, and this may not make optimal use of ALT testing to reduce transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB). Defining an ALT acceptability criterion in absolute terms is necessary because relative cutoffs based on local donor populations may be affected by the prevalence of NANB in each community. This study involved 16 laboratories using 23 different analytic systems. The ALT results of the analysis of a plasma reference sample could be used to translate mathematically a single, absolute cutoff to units applicable to each analytic system. The distribution of ALT results in 1.4 million donations from across the country was established; basing the cutoff on this sample avoids the problems inherent in using a local donor base to establish a cutoff. We propose the implementation of a system to standardize ALT acceptability criteria to an activity level defined by analysis of a nationwide donor sample.\r"

However, vancomycin-induced hemagglutination complicated red cell (RBC) serologic testing in the blood bank. At concentrations greater than 3.0 mg per ml, vancomycin caused spontaneous macroscopic red cell (RBC) aggregation; concentrations of 2.0 and 2.5 mg per ml were associated with weakly positive aggregation with anti-IgG and polyspecific antiglobulin reagents negative with anti-complement; and concentrations less than 1.5 mg per ml had no apparent effect. Ficin-treated RBCs demonstrated negative reactions with the antiglobulin reagents. Vancomycin-induced aggregation was reversed partially with 0.2 M trisodium citrate, and supernatant transfer studies showed that normal RBCs retained a significantly (p less than 0.025) greater percentage of vancomycin than did ficin-treated RBCs. Vancomycin causes the aggregation of RBCs, which can be a source of confusion in the blood bank. The mechanism(s) through which vancomycin enhances aggregation may be related to its polycationic properties and to its direct protein binding to the RBC membrane, although other nonimmunologic mechanisms may be operative.\r"

Veteran donors experienced significantly less discomfort before donation. These findings imply that blood donations can be viewed as an \"opponent-affective process,\" in which initial, mildly aversive feelings lead to positive aftereffects. Current findings suggest that blood donation can be explained, in part, by a self-serving, addictive process.\r"

The mean probability of exclusion (A) of red cell surface antigen, Gm, Hp, and HLA systems was determined in this situation for North American whites and blacks by creating pairs of a man and an unrelated child. In whites, the most valuable of the systems investigated to indicate nonpaternity for false fathers were HLA, Rh, Fy, and MNSs, in that order. HLA, MNSs, and Gm were the most valuable systems in blacks. With all of the genetic systems used in this study, the combined probability of exclusion (CPE) of men falsely accused of paternity, in cases where the mother is absent, is approximately 95 percent for whites and 92 percent for blacks. Since only indirect exclusions are possible without the mother, the common test panel of HLA and red cell antigens may not always allow an adequate study. Extended testing is recommended to include additional genetic systems in order to achieve an average combined probability of exclusion of at least 95 percent.\r"

During previous use of this methodology, we have quantified rates of false biological positive results using commercial kit assays in a normal donor population. In this study, we have identified a potential source for false negative results. Using multiple lots of two different commercial ELISA kits, the absorbance readings at the test end point could not differentiate between normal non-reactive donor samples and blanks containing no sample. These results occur using normal donor samples, even though the assays could distinguish between blank wells and the manufacturers' \"normal controls\", provided with the assay. Our findings suggest that a technical pipetting error is presently undetectable, either visually or by statistical methods, and could permit an untested, potentially HIV-1 positive, unit to be released into the transfusable blood supply. A possible solution is suggested.\r"

The serum tumor markers were not increased. The teratomas were all localized retroperitoneally, two being found near the site of excision of a residual tumor after remission-induction chemotherapy. Two of the 3 patients were alive without further treatment after excision of the teratoma; the third patient did not die of tumor progression, but mature teratoma was still present. Even if the serum tumor markers are not increased, recurrent tumors in patients previously given PVB chemotherapy because of a disseminated NSTT should be excised to establish their histology. En-bloc excision of the recurrent tumor is sufficient. It is pointed out that a mature teratoma can become a large cystic tumor in the course of time: the so-called growing mature teratoma syndrome. We believe that, after remission-induction chemotherapy of disseminated NSTT with a teratoma component in the primary testicular tumor, any residual tumor should be excised to prevent subsequent tumor progression.\r"

All techniques resulted in a significant decrease in transvalvular pressure gradient and an increase in calculated aortic valve area, without significant difference among the three. There was no increase in the degree of aortic regurgitation after valvuloplasty by any of the techniques. Vascular complications occurred only with the retrograde double balloon technique. Cardiac tamponade during balloon inflation occurred with both the retrograde single and double balloon techniques. Three deaths occurred; two during the antegrade technique and one after the retrograde double balloon technique. Thus, balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be effectively performed using any of the three techniques. However, the differing techniques have inherent advantages in specific situations, as well as potential complications.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of intravenous enoximone were studied in 15 male patients, mean age 62.2 years, with New York Heart Association classes II to IV congestive heart failure (coronary artery disease in 10 and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in five patients; mean ejection fraction, 0.19). All patients had spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias; eight had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), one had ventricular fibrillation, and six had nonsustained VT. Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters including VT induction were determined before and during an intravenous infusion of enoximone. The cardiac index increased (2.49 +/- 0.89 to 2.96 +/- 0.78), and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased (22.4 +/- 13.2 to 10.0 +/- 9.0) after enoximone per predefined protocol endpoints. There was a significant decrease in spontaneous sinus cycle length, corrected sinus nodal recovery time, AH interval during atrial pacing, shortest cycle length at which 1:1 atrioventricular nodal conduction occurred, and refractory periods of the atrium, ventricle, and atrioventricular node. Enoximone did not alter the cycle length of induced VT, and there was no consistent change in the number of extrastimuli required for VT induction. A baseline 24-hour ECG recording was obtained on 14 patients (while receiving a long-term antiarrhythmic drug regimen, if needed) and repeated after 1 week and 1 month of oral enoximone therapy. There was no significant increase in the number of premature ventricular complexes per hour or VT episodes per 24 hours after 1 week or 1 month of therapy with enoximone. However, if four patients who received amiodarone and may not yet have reached steady state were excluded from analysis, there was a significant increase in the frequency of premature ventricular complexes per hour 1 month after initiation of enoximone. We conclude that intravenous enoximone reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and increases cardiac output in most patients. Intravenous enoximone in doses sufficient to have hemodynamic effects shortens atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness and decreases AV nodal conduction time but has no consistent effect on VT induction or VT cycle length. The frequency of spontaneous ventricular ectopy may increase in some patients after oral enoximone, but its clinical significance is undefined. Enoximone may be administered cautiously to patients with congestive heart failure and preexisting ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

This study compares the defibrillation efficacy of a standard monophasic truncated exponential to a biphasic 12 msec truncated exponential waveform in 21 patients undergoing automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) surgery. For the biphasic waveform, the polarity was reversed and remaining capacitor voltage was attenuated by 75% after 6 msec. Two hundred thirty episodes of VF were induced with 115 \"matched pairs\" of monophasic and biphasic waveforms of identical initial capacitor voltages given over a range from 70 to 600 V (0.35 to 25.7 joules). The biphasic waveform was superior to the monophasic waveform (p less than 0.006), especially for \"low energy\" defibrillation. For initial voltages less than 200 V, the percent successful defibrillation was 28% for the monophasic waveform versus 64% for the biphasic waveform and from 200 to 290 V (energies less than 6.4 joules) it was 45% versus 69%. There was no difference in the two waveforms in time to the first QRS complex or in the blood pressure following defibrillation. This study shows that a 12 msec biphasic truncated exponential is superior to a 6 msec monophasic waveform for defibrillation in man, especially at energies less than 6.4 joules. The waveform can be achieved in an implanted device without any increase in capacitor size or in battery energy consumption.\r"

We have developed a method to characterize left ventricular filling, by integrating Doppler measurements of flow velocity across the mitral valve. The purpose of the present study was to compare this new method with contrast left ventriculographic assessment of left ventricular filling. Pulsed Doppler studies were obtained within 24 hours of left ventriculography in 15 patients: three normal subjects, seven with coronary disease, two with mitral stenosis, and three with dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with myocardial infarction, regional wall movement abnormalities, or aortic regurgitation were excluded. Doppler-derived relative left ventricular filling was compared to filling from right anterior oblique left ventriculograms. Doppler and angiographic filling curves were qualitatively different in normal subjects and in patients with mitral stenosis and cardiomyopathy. For individual patients, however, the Doppler and angiographic filling curves were qualitatively similar, with a strong correlation between Doppler and angiographic estimates of percent filling (r = 0.95; p less than 0.001). These preliminary observations suggest that Doppler echocardiography may provide a reliable assessment of the time course of left ventricular diastolic filling. Further studies are warranted and should include more patients with diverse cardiac abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of pulsed and continuous wave (CW) Doppler methods for evaluating aortic regurgitation (AR) was compared in patients with and without mitral stenosis (MS), with aortic root angiography as a gold standard. AR was diagnosed with pulsed Doppler echocardiography, by the detection of broad frequency spectral patterns in the isovolumic relaxation time. If these indications were present, AR was graded by examining the extent of diastolic turbulence in the left ventricular cavity (flow mapping method). With CW Doppler echocardiography, AR was diagnosed by the detection of a peak velocity of greater than 2 m/s; if this velocity was attained, AR was graded by measuring the time from the peak velocity to half the peak velocity (half-time method). The angiographic grade corresponded to that determined by the pulsed and CW Doppler methods in 37 and 37 of 46 patients without MS, respectively. Angiographic grade corresponded to the grade determined by the pulsed and CW Doppler methods in 13 and 17 of the 23 patients with MS, respectively. Eight of 10 discrepancies between pulsed Doppler and angiographic grades were due to overestimation of AR by the flow mapping method, apparently because the transmitral jet produces diastolic turbulence in the left ventricular cavity independent of AR. On the other hand, three of six discrepancies between CW Doppler and angiographic grades were due to the incapability of detecting signals of AR by CW Doppler echocardiography. Thus both the pulsed and the CW Doppler methods are useful to evaluate AR in patients without MS. In patients with MS, however, AR is most accurately diagnosed by the detection of AR signals in the isovolumic relaxation time by pulsed Doppler echocardiography, and the degree of AR is more accurately assessed by the CW Doppler half-time method.\r"

All had hepatosplenomegaly, fever, pneumonia with tachypnea, and tachycardia ascribed to infection and anemia. An S3 gallop was present in six of eight. All had normal creatine phosphokinase values. Chest x-rays did not aid in the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction. ECG showed flattened T waves in five of eight with left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, or both in seven of eight. Results of echocardiography showed decreased left ventricular function in all eight, despite anemia, with dilated left ventricular myopathy in six, concentric left ventricular wall thickening in two of eight, an enlarged right ventricle in two, and pericardial fluid in three. Medical therapy improved cardiac function in all. All patients subsequently died of noncardiac causes. Results of autopsies on four of eight patients showed focal myocarditis in two (with cytomegalovirus inclusions in one) and dilated cardiomyopathy in two others. We conclude: (1) Preexistent hepatosplenomegaly, fever, infection, and anemia result in physical findings that mimic findings of heart failure, thereby masking the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction; (2) an S3 gallop may indicate the presence of impaired heart function when other clinical signs are masked; (3) confirmation of cardiac compromise may be accomplished by noninvasive evaluation with echocardiography and (4) medical therapy can improve cardiac dysfunction in HIV-infected children.\r"

To assess the effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart in nine previously untreated patients with echocardiographically-detected left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular mass and rapid left ventricular filling rate were compared before and after 6 months of treatment with metoprolol monotherapy. Metoprolol was given in doses of 100 to 400 mg/day (average dose, 167 mg/day in two divided doses) and significantly reduced both casual, office blood pressure (150/101 to 130/86 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (139/91 to 126/79 mm Hg, p less than 0.05 for systolic, p less than 0.01 for diastolic). Following treatment with metoprolol, left ventricular mass index decreased from 135 +/- 20 to 120 +/- 13 gm/m2 (p less than 0.05), while rapid left ventricular filling rate increased from 1.89 +/- 0.24 to 2.09 +/- 0.27 end-diastolic volumes/sec (p less than 0.01). The reduction in left ventricular mass index was secondary to decreased posterior and septal wall thicknesses (13% and 11%, respectively, p less than 0.05 for both), as there were no changes in the left ventricular internal dimensions. Neither resting nor exercise left ventricular ejection fraction changed on metoprolol therapy compared to the baseline values. These data demonstrate that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in never-previously-treated hypertensive patients is accompanied by improved diastolic performance following beta-adrenergic blocker monotherapy.\r"

VF was the most frequent ventricular tachyarrhythmia, usually secondary to VT. The rest were due to torsades de pointes in patients often without heart disease but who were taking antiarrhythmic drugs. The VT leading to VF was often preceded by sinus tachycardia or new atrial tachyarrhythmia. Only a small percentage of patients presented ischemic ST changes. In patients who died due to bradyarrhythmias, this was more often due to sinus depression than to atrioventricular block.\r"

An index of prognostic risk (PR), showing the percent of adverse events attributable to silent ischemia, is calculated to measure the potential impact of successful treatment of silent ischemia on population mortality. Type 1 individuals' PR is estimated at a low 3.8%, suggesting that screening the general asymptomatic population would be unproductive. Type 2 patients exhibit an 80% PR. We lack the empirical information to estimate type 3 patients' PR, but silent ischemia is a recognized adverse prognostic factor in the subgroup exhibiting unstable angina. These results suggest that successful treatment of silent ischemia might favorably influence coronary artery disease patient outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the effects of balloon aortic valvuloplasty on left ventricular systolic function and ejection dynamics, Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed on 29 patients before and following valvuloplasty. Continuous wave aortic velocity signals were digitized and (with catheterization laboratory before and after valvuloplasty valve areas) were used to calculate: stroke volume; ejection time; ejection rate; time to 25%, 50%, and 75% ejection; accelerative (onset systole to peak velocity) ejection volume, time, and rate; and decelerative (peak velocity to end systole) ejection volume, time, and rate. Following valvuloplasty, there were no significant changes in heart rate; time to 25%, 50%, and 75% ejection; accelerative ejection time; and decelerative ejection time. There were significant increases in stroke volume, total ejection rate, accelerative ejection volume, decelerative ejection volume, accelerative ejection rate, and decelerative ejection rate, and a significant decrease in total ejection time. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty has a significant effect on the dynamics of left ventricular ejection. There is an increase in stroke volume and a decrease in ejection time, with relatively little effect on early systole, and a more pronounced effect in late systole. There are significant increases in accelerative and decelerative ejection volumes and rates, and a decrease in the time required for the last 25% of ejection. By improving the mobility of calcified leaflets, balloon aortic valvuloplasty may reduce the forces opposing forward blood movement during the decelerative phase of aortic ejection.\r"

Favorable outcomes were noted in 52 patients (78%). Vasospasm was found by arteriography in 31 patients (46%). A dose-related trend was noted. At the lower dose levels, angiographic spasm was observed in 68% and symptomatic vasospasm in 27% of 34 patients. Only eight of 33 patients (24%) treated at the highest dose level (approximately 10 mg/hr) developed arteriographic evidence of vasospasm. Symptomatic vasospasm was diagnosed in only two of 33 patients (6%) treated with this dose. No deaths from vasospasm occurred. Verification of changes in tissue calcium has been obtained from the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model, and we concluded that nicardipine administered after permanent occlusion may offer protection against cerebral ischemia in this animal model. Nicardipine uptake was greater at the infarct site than in surrounding tissue, with the highest concentration in the area of maximal ischemia. Nicardipine appears to affect changes in Ca2+ more than other ions: it significantly reduced Ca2+ accumulation in the territory of the middle cerebral artery by 60% at 6 hours, and significantly reduced Na+ and K+ shifts in the same territory by 40% and 50%, respectively, at 6 hours. Although much research remains to be done, a wide role for the dihydropyridines in a number of cerebrovascular conditions is emerging.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMV) was performed in 10 female patients with mitral stenosis; their mean age was 31 +/- 1 years. All patients underwent echophonocardiography (Echophono) before and less than 24 hours after PMV1. Cardiac catheterization and Echophono were repeated 10 and 22 months after PMV1. Eight patients with suboptimal results (defined as a post-PMV mitral valve area [MVA]/less than 1.0 cm2 and mean gradient greater than/10 mm Hg) underwent repeat PMV (PMV2) 10 months after PMV1. The Echophono data are correlated with clinical and hemodynamic changes produced by PMV1 and PMV2. MVA increased from 0.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.1 +/- 0.01 cm2 (p = 0.0009) when PMV1 was performed with a mean effective balloon dilating area (EBDA) of 5 +/- 0.19 cm2. MVA increased from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p = 0.0002) when PMV2 was performed with larger EBDA (6.4 +/- 0.34 cm2). Two factors related to the learning curve account for the superior result of PMV2: (1) use of larger EBDA and (2) optimal position of the balloons parallel to the long axis of the left ventricle. PMV1 resulted in Echophono changes consistent with decreased severity of mitral stenosis: shortening of Q-S1 from 93 +/- 4 to 82 +/- 4 msec (p less than 0.05) and (Q-S1)-(S2-OS) from 1.8 +/- 0.8 to -0.9 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.01); prolongation of S2-OS from 75 +/- 5 to 91 +/- 5 msec (p less than 0.05) and increase of EF slope from 7 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 4 mm/sec (p less than 0.05). Compared with PMV1, post PMV2 Echophono showed a further decrease in the severity of mitral stenosis: Q-S1 decreased to 78 +/- 3 msec and (Q-S1)-(S2-OS) decreased to -0.5 +/- 0.3 msec. S2-OS increased to 86 +/- 5 msec and EF slope increased to 22 +/- 4 mm/sec. The hemodynamic and Echophono changes produced by PMV1 and PMV2 persisted at the corresponding follow-up studies. There was no evidence of restenosis. Thus Echophono is a simple, low cost method helpful in the evaluation and follow-up of patients undergoing PMV.\r"

Patients were seen on an outpatient basis and after a 2- to 4-week washout period were admitted to the study. The initial nicardipine dose of 20 mg three times a day was titrated in subsequent weeks; thereafter a second antihypertensive drug was added if seated diastolic blood pressure was not reduced below 90 mm Hg. The nicardipine-based therapy significantly lowered seated blood pressure in the whole population (mean 185/102 to 152/86 mm Hg) without clinically and statistically significant differences between the patient subgroups with concomitant diseases. There were no changes in either symptoms, or biochemical and instrumental tests of the concomitant diseases. The incidence of side effects was low; in particular, there was no orthostatic hypotension. Nicardipine-based treatment is therefore effective, safe, and well tolerated in elderly hypertensive patients with concomitant disease.\r"

In dogs, reperfusion was initiated 2 to 4 hours after coronary occlusion. CK activity was measured in serial plasma samples and infarct size was assessed histochemically at 24 hours. A substantial and consistent fraction of the total CK appearing in plasma over 24 hours (cumulative CK) appeared in plasma soon after reperfusion, i.e., 21 +/- 2% (SE) within 30 minutes and 38 +/- 3% within 1 hour. The rate of increase of plasma CK activity correlated closely with infarct size when CK release was measured during the first 30 minutes (r = 0.92) or 60 minutes (r = 0.92) after reperfusion (n = 18). Similarly, in patients the rate of increase of CK activity measured within 2.5 hours of the time of reperfusion was closely related to infarct size delineated by positron emission tomography 1 to 2 weeks later (r = 0.93). Thus the rate of appearance of CK in plasma early after reperfusion reflects the extent of irreversible injury ultimately sustained and provides a criterion likely to be useful for prospective identification of patients at high risk after coronary recanalization.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to determine whether regional beta-adrenergic blockade via the coronary sinus limited myocardial damage after coronary artery occlusion in the canine model. Accordingly, open-chest anesthetized dogs were randomly allocated to one of three groups: a control group and groups treated with propranolol (in doses of 0.02, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/kg) given either intravenously or via the coronary sinus. The hypoperfused zone (i.e., risk area) and the extent of myocardial damage were assessed by autoradiography and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, respectively. Myocardial damage expressed as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was 84 +/- 5% in the control group (n = 9) and 78 +/- 7% (0.02 mg/kg, n = 7, NS), 63 +/- 6% (0.2 mg/kg, n = 7, p less than 0.05), and 62 +/- 7% (2.0 mg/kg, n = 9, p less than 0.02) in the groups receiving intravenous propranolol and 73 +/- 6% (0.02 mg/kg, n = 7, NS), 58 +/- 7% (0.2 mg/kg, n = 7, p less than 0.01), and 44 +/- 9% (2.0 mg/kg, n = 9, p less than 0.001) in groups receiving propranolol via the cardiac veins. There was a significant enhancement of myocardial salvage with increasing doses of propranolol delivered via the cardiac veins (linear regression trend, p less than 0.05). In contrast, myocardial damage expressed as a percent of the hypoperfused zone remained comparable with propranolol doses of 0.2 and 2.0 mg/kg administered intravenously (linear regression trend, NS). In conclusion: (1) regional beta-adrenergic blockade via the cardiac veins afforded significant myocardial salvage and (2) the regional administration of propranolol resulted in significant reduction of myocardial damage in a dose-dependent fashion.\r"

Intravenous atenolol or propranolol produced no beneficial effects on systolic shortening in the area rendered ischemic during 2 minutes of circumflex occlusion, before collateral development. After the collateral development by repetitive 2-minute coronary occlusions, regional asynergy recovered to the preocclusive level during 2 minutes of occlusion. Both atenolol and propranolol significantly improved the peak reductions of regional shortening by 19 +/- 9% and 18 +/- 9%, respectively (p less than 0.05 versus without beta-blockade). These beneficial actions of beta-blockade were again noted during atrial tachypacing at matched heart rates of 160 +/- 11 beats/min. Thus the beneficial effects of beta-blockade on regional asynergy during coronary occlusion depend on the level of functional state of the collaterals and cannot be totally accounted for by the reduction in heart rate or by the cardioselectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Few studies have examined metabolic consequences of coronary occlusion and reperfusion using phosphorus31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in an intact animal model. Accordingly, we developed a model to study serial changes in myocardial metabolism in the intact open-chest rabbit. Ten animals underwent 20 +/- 2 minutes of regional coronary occlusion and 60 +/- 10 minutes of reperfusion followed by reocclusion. Cardiac-gated 31P-NMR spectra were obtained with a regional surface coil over the ischemic area during baseline, occlusion, reperfusion, and reocclusion conditions. Phosphocreatine fell with both the initial and second ischemic insults to 65% +/- 5% of baseline for the first occlusion (p less than 0.01) and tended to decrease to 89% +/- 8% of baseline for the second occlusion (p = 0.07), with normal levels reattained in the intervening period of reperfusion (99% +/- 5% of baseline, p = NS). Concordant inverse changes were seen with inorganic phosphates. At occlusion levels of inorganic phosphates were 135% +/- 10% of baseline (p less than 0.05) and 139% +/- 10% of baseline at reocclusion (p less than 0.05). Levels of adenosine triphosphate decreased during occlusion to 78% +/- 9% of baseline and were significantly lower than baseline during the second occlusion (75% +/- 5% of baseline, p less than 0.01). The ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphates, when compared with values at baseline, decreased at occlusion (49.6% +/- 4.7% of baseline, p less than 0.01) and at reocclusion (64.7% +/- 4.9% of baseline, p less than 0.01), with a normal ratio reattained in the intervening period of reperfusion (93.3% +/- 3.1% of baseline, p = NS). We conclude that reperfusion restores levels of phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate while returning levels of inorganic phosphates to baseline. Deleterious changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism are not potentiated by reocclusion in this model. 31P-NMR spectroscopy holds promise as a technique to noninvasively monitor intracellular biochemical processes serially during various interventions in the intact animal model.\r"

All had left ventricular infarction documented at autopsy, and 17 (71%) had concomitant right ventricular involvement. The highest specificity (100%) and positive predictive value (100%) were calculated for the right-chest leads, whereas values for ratio III/II greater than 1 were 88% and 91%, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. It is concluded that differences in ST elevation in leads III and II can be the basis for a diagnosis of right ventricular involvement in ECG-diagnosed inferior/posterior infarction. The diagnosis, however, may be achieved more easily with right-chest leads.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with variant angina, a positive ergonovine test, and a favorable response to calcium antagonists were studied by serial ergonovine tests and Holter monitoring to assess the long-term changes in response to ergonovine and the relationship with the spontaneous activity of the disease. The number of patients with a positive test decreased from 18 of 18 in the acute phase to 12 of 18 (66%) at 3 months, 10 of 17 (59%) at 6 months, and five of 17 (29%) at 12 months. The mean dose level of ergonovine associated with a positive response and the percentage of positive tests with ST segment depression increased progressively during follow-up. The results of the ergonovine test were well correlated with the spontaneous activity of the disease in 94%, 83%, 76%, and 71% of the patients at initial observation and at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Thus in patients with variant angina and a favorable response to calcium antagonists, a time-related decrease in sensitivity to ergonovine develops during follow-up. In most patients the response to ergonovine is well correlated with the spontaneous activity of the disease; thus the ergonovine test may be a useful tool in the assessment of the natural evolution of vasospastic angina.\r"

  ".W": "A postmarketing surveillance study on triamterene 75 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg was conducted by the Philadelphia Association of Clinical Trials on 70,898 patients. These patients received either a whole table (71% of patients) or half tablet (25.2% of patients); 61.3% of all patients continued to take the same dose throughout the 4-week study. The most frequent adverse reactions were generally nonspecific and typical of therapy with a diuretic. The withdrawal rate due to adverse events was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) with the smaller (4.4%) than with the larger (5.6%) dosage. Although not statistically significant overall, reported adverse reactions also favored a lower dose. In general, adverse reactions occurred more frequently in those taking concomitant medications. No significant difference relating to dose was detected in the percentage of initially normokalemic patients who became hyper- or hypokalemic by the end of the study. Older patients tended to achieve goal blood pressure more frequently than did younger patients. These results suggest that the potential for the development of thiazide-induced hypokalemia and other adverse effects appears to be greatly reduced by the use of a potassium-sparing agent combined with a thiazide diuretic, without incurring a greatly increased risk of hyperkalemia and without sacrificing efficacy.\r"

Fasting plasma retinyl esters demonstrated a significant increase with vitamin A supplement use. For supplemental vitamin A intakes of 5001-10,000 IU/d, a 2.5-fold increase over nonusers in fasting plasma retinyl esters was observed for elderly people (p less than 0.05) and a 1.5-fold increase for young adults (p greater than 0.20). For elderly people, greater fasting plasma retinyl esters were associated with long-term vitamin A supplement use (greater than 5 y) and biochemical evidence of liver damage. Elderly people who take vitamin A supplements may be at increased risk for vitamin A overload.\r"

The subjects were 51 newborn infants with birth weights less than or equal to 1520 g. During hospitalization the infants were fed human milk. On the third day of life oral vitamin E supplementation of less than or equal to 10 mg/d was started in all infants. In addition, 23 infants selected at random were given intramuscular vitamin E (20 mg/kg/d) during the first 3 d. The data indicate that the 10 mg/d supplement resulted in an adequate plasma concentration of vitamin E. After cessation of supplementation at age 3 mo, the risk of low plasma vitamin E levels increased. Although intramuscular administration resulted in long-lasting increments in mean plasma vitamin E values, some later levels in these infants were marginal.\r"

Both agents inhibited biotin transport in BBMV in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition by both carbamazepine and primidone was competitive (inhibition constant [Ki] of 4.70 and 2.25 mmol/L, respectively) and appeared to be specific because the transport of D-glucose was not affected by different concentrations of these pharmacologic agents. The transport of biotin in BLMV was not affected by carbamazepine or primidone. These results demonstrate that carbamazepine and primidone are competitive inhibitors of biotin transport in the human intestine and that the inhibitory effect is directed toward the substrate transport system at the brush border membrane of the enterocyte. These findings may relate to possible impairment of biotin status in patients on long-term therapy with anticonvulsant agents.\r"

Fe in the two kinds of rolls was labeled with two radioisotopes of Fe (55Fe, 59Fe) and the rolls were served on alternate days. The inhibition of Fe absorption was strongly related to the amount of phytate added; 2 mg inhibited absorption by 18%, (p less than 0.001), 25 mg by 64% (p less than 0.001), and 250 mg by 82% (p less than 0.001). The addition of ascorbic acid significantly counteracted the inhibition whereas the corresponding effect of meat was less well defined and only seen at the highest phytate level. The marked inhibition of Fe absorption by phytates and the significant counteracting effect of ascorbic acid have wide nutritional implications.\r"

Retention at day 10 was 2.9 +/- 1.8% (means +/- SD) and varied from 0.6 to 9.2% when measured in 14 healthy subjects. Large interindividual variations in rate of excretion were observed. The retention measurements for days 10-30, however, could be closely fitted to a single exponential function for each individual. The results regarding intraindividual and interindividual variation in Mn retention indicate that factors influencing Mn absorption can be identified only by repeated administrations using each subject as his/her own control.\r"

It identifies reduction of fat consumption as the primary dietary priority and distinguishes recommendations appropriate for the general public from those for special populations. Its consensus on the scientific basis of diet-disease relationships establishes a foundation from which to develop policies and programs to implement the report's recommendations. The federal role in implementation is necessary and desirable but not sufficient.

Body composition and TOBEC measurements were obtained from 11 healthy miniature piglets before and after an intraperitoneal injection of physiological saline. The procedure expanded the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by 11.8-34.1%, which represented an average increase in TBW of 7.9%. The linear regressions that related the preinjection and postinjection estimates of TBW or FFM to the corresponding transformed TOBEC signals were the same. Thus, the prediction equations derived for the untreated piglets accurately predicted both TBW and FFM in the piglets whose volume was expanded. These data suggest that prediction equations derived from healthy subjects should be equally valid for subjects with altered fluid status.\r"

Mean weight loss was 10.0 +/- 2.8 kg and loss of fat-free mass was measured to be 2.3 +/- 1.7 kg (23%) by densitometry and 0.6 +/- 1.9 kg (6%) by impedance measurements. The underestimation of the change in fat-free mass measured by the impedance method could be due to losses of water bound to glycogen after the weight-reduction period. For this reason the impedance method may be not applicable in studies in which changes in glycogen stores can be expected.\r"

Intragastric temperature, measured by an intragastric temperature sensor attached to the nasogastric tube, returned to body temperature 16.7 +/- 2.7 min after the hot meal and 23.8 +/- 1.1 min after the cold meal. Gastric acid secretion increased after hot, warm, and cold coffee but the initial temperature of the meal had no effect on gastric acid secretion. The temperature of the meal also had no effect on serum gastrin concentrations, which increased significantly after all the meals. Gastric emptying of hot, warm, or cold coffee meals was similar. These findings indicate that over a wide temperature range, the temperature of a liquid meal has little effect on gastric function in humans.\r"

Babies receiving a formula of higher acidity containing predominantly curd protein absorbed a significantly lower percentage of their fat and nitrogen intake than babies receiving a curd-and-whey protein formula (fat absorptions of 73 +/- 11.0 and 85 +/- 8.0%, means +/- SD, p less than 0.04; N absorptions of 90 +/- 3.0 and 93 +/- 1.0%, p less than 0.03, respectively). The feces of the curd-formula babies contained a smaller proportion of long-chain, saturated fatty acids and a larger proportion of shorter-chain and unsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acid type and triglyceride structure are not the only factors influencing fat absorption in newborns. Other formula components may need modification to achieve maximum fat absorption.\r"

We studied the basal urinary excretion of 1MH and whether this was influenced by infection and we compared the use of 3MH vs the 3MH:creatinine ratio (3MH:Cr) in detecting changes during infection. The basal excretion of 1MH was 84.9 mumol/24 h and its creatinine molar ratio (1MH:Cr) was 7.4 x 10(-3) with no change during infection. Because 1MH:Cr was significantly increased in 4 of 14 patients, their 3MH values were considered influenced by meat intake and thus discarded. Among the remaining 10 patients, 9 showed a significant individual increase in 3MH:Cr during infection compared with only 4 in 3MH. This was due to a higher precision in 3MH:Cr despite the concomitant significant increase in urinary creatinine excretion.\r"

Bulimic patients ate fewer kilocalories per kilogram body weight (22.1 +/- 4.6 kcal/kg) than did age-matched normal women (29.7 +/- 6.5 kcal/kg) but had similar activity levels and body composition. Clinical variables, such as history of laxative abuse, anorexia, or obesity, and physiological characteristics, such as body weight, activity level, or dietary content, could not account for this difference in caloric consumption. Bulimic patients tended to eat a diet lower in fat and higher in protein than did control subjects.

The dental hygiene students chewed an oat cereal for either 20 or 60 s while under two different orders of stress and relaxation conditions: 1) stress/20 s, stress/60 s, relax/20 s, relax/60 s; and 2) relax/20 s, relax/60 s, stress/20 s, stress/60 s. Galvanic skin resistance, pulse rate, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) were used to physiologically verify the effects of stress and relaxation on amylase activity. Amylase activity was judged by spectrophotometric analysis of maltose produced from a specific dilution of expectorated saliva. Results showed that the physiological measures significantly corroborated the salivary determinations of stress and relaxation and that deep relaxation was significantly more important than thorough chewing in the oral digestion of complex carbohydrates.\r"

In the group who received no anticholinergic premedication, sinus tachycardia was evident during endoscopy, but the only clinically important change was in one patient who converted to atrial flutter from atrial fibrillation. The heart rate increased during endoscopy among patients undergoing the procedure for the first time, but it did not increase in the patients who had previously undergone endoscopy. These results show that endoscopy is a relatively safe examination from the view point of cardiac risk when performed without the administration of an anticholinergic agent, but that cardiac patients should be monitored carefully. The endoscopist should also take into consideration the psychological state of the examinees.\r"

  ".W": "The interdigestive gastroduodenal motility was studied by means of a multilumen manometric probe in eight patients with active duodenal ulcer (group DU1) and in seven patients with hypersecretory gastroduodenitis (group GD). Both groups were selected on the basis of the presence of gastric acid hypersecretion. A group of five patients with non-active duodenal ulcer (group DU2) and a group of eight healthy subjects (group C) also were examined. Both of the latter groups were selected on the basis of the presence of normal gastric secretion. After a basal recording period of 200-300 min, in hypersecretory groups DU1 and GD, ranitidine was administered to decrease acid secretion; in normosecretory groups C and D2, impromidine was infused at two scalar doses to increase acid secretion. The basal recording showed in groups DU1 and GD a longer than normal time interval between consecutive activity fronts (AF) of the migrating motor complex (MMC cycle) and a shorter than normal percent of time occupied by AFs. In normal subjects and in DU2, the administration of the lowest dose of impromidine induced a motor pattern similar to that of the basal period of groups DU and GD, whereas the highest dose disrupted the MMC pattern that was replaced by an irregular motor activity. The results of this study indicate that duodenal ulcer with acid hypersecretion shows a marked inhibition of the MMC cycle that is not due to the ulcer itself, but to the increased acid secretion. In fact, the same motor pattern is observed in other hypersecretory states, both spontaneous and drug-induced, whereas DU with normal secretion showed a near normal motility. In active duodenal ulcer, the decreased incidence and duration of activity fronts may play a role in the pathogenesis of peptide ulcer, as it may impair the cyclic duodenal acid clearing, allowing a longer than normal contact of HCl with the duodenal mucosa.\r"

Patients with PA had normal analogue levels that were unchanged or that rose during cessation of B12 administration. Patients with IBS, Crohn's colitis, ulcerative colitis, and total colectomies had B12 analogues in the normal range. Patients with diseased or resected ileums had low B12 and analogues. These data suggest that serum B12 analogues are absorbed in the ileum by a mechanism independent of intrinsic factor, and that colonic bacteria and endogenous metabolism of vitamin B12 do not contribute significantly to their level.\r"

The mean FFC of patients with pancreatic disease (15.0 +/- 1.9 g%, mean +/- SEM) was significantly higher than that of patients with other diseases causing malabsorption (8.9 +/- 0.3 g%, p less than 0.001). Forty-two percent of patients with pancreatic steatorrhea had an FFC below 10 g%. The overlapping of the FFC of steatorrhea due to pancreatic disease and that produced by celiac disease, gastric resection, and other conditions suggests that this approach does not differentiate between pancreatic and intestinal steatorrhea.\r"

The cigarette-smoking habits of 115 patients with Crohn's disease were compared with the cigarette-smoking exposure of 109 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with Crohn's disease were more likely to smoke at the time of symptom onset than were irritable bowel syndrome controls (age and sex adjusted odds ratio 3.71, 95% confidence interval 1.93-7.13). After the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, patients were less likely to quit smoking (odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.69) than controls. This study demonstrates an association and a temporal relationship between cigarette smoking and Crohn's disease.

Motility during fasting, eating, and after eating a meal was similar in patients with quiescent disease and controls. Motility increased significantly during eating in controls, but not in patients with quiescent disease. In patients with active colitis, motility was significantly reduced during fasting, eating, and after eating, compared with controls. Motility increased significantly during eating in patients with active disease. Propagated activity was similar in the three study groups; therefore, the decreased motility was due to decrease in segmental contractions.

Both patients developed this complication within 6 h of sclerosing sessions during which sodium morrhuate was used. Each cleared her hematuria within 4 days without developing oliguric renal insufficiency. Subsequent sclerotherapy was associated with no untoward effects. These are the only two pediatric patients among 40 whose varices we have sclerosed who have developed gross hematuria at the time of sclerotherapy, and they are our only two patients undergoing sclerotherapy who have had cystic fibrosis. The factors rendering them vulnerable to renal or urinary tract insult in the absence of other systemic complications are unclear. However, the therapeutic endoscopist should be cognizant of this potential adverse reaction when performing sclerotherapy.\r"

Recent evidence of the efficacy of hypertension control in slowing the decline in renal function and our ability to detect those at highest risk for renal deterioration with inexpensive microalbuminuria tests suggest major opportunities for concerted efforts to reduce the incidence of end-stage renal disease. Guidelines for management of high-risk patients are needed to translate effective management strategies into routine clinical practice.\r"

However, review of the original reports on the predictability of microalbuminuria revealed a concomitant presence of elevated BP and a propensity to falling GFR. Thus, the predictability of microalbuminuria rests on the added evaluation of BP and GFR. Additional investigation is needed to address the possibility that microalbuminuria and either a rising BP or a falling GFR or both indicates established diabetic nephropathy rather than predicting its development.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal albumin excretion in the range not previously detectable by routine clinical methods can now be readily quantified, and has been shown to predict the development of clinically significant nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and to predict excess mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Albuminuria of this degree has been inappropriately called \"microalbuminuria,\" a misleading term which should be abandoned. In IDDM, persistent minimal elevation of albumin excretion predicts the development of more severe proteinuria and clinical diabetic nephropathy, which frequently progresses to renal failure. In NIDDM, the predictive value for renal failure remains to be established, but excess mortality occurs in those with abnormal albumin excretion, suggesting that it is an indicator of generalized vascular disease. However, the normal range of albumin excretion in older subjects is not well established. The relationship of glomerular injury to mildly elevated albumin excretion is uncertain. Several means of reducing the excretion rate have been described, but whether these can halt or prevent progression of glomerular injury is unknown. Thus, at the present time detection of mildly elevated albumin excretion and intervention to reduce the incidence of diabetic nephropathy or other diabetes-related complications fail to meet generally accepted criteria for prescriptive screening. However, such measurements of albumin excretion provide an important tool for research into the natural history and pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

The intraindividual variation of albumin concentration in first morning specimens from diabetics is such that no threshold value gives the desired 100% nosological sensitivity. However, a threshold value of 30 mg/L confers 100% specificity, and a single abnormal result therefore requires initiation of therapy. Patients with negative results should continue to be monitored regularly.\r"

  ".W": "The possible differential elimination of the anionic IgG4 and of the other cationic IgG molecules whose pH differs but whose other characteristics are similar, has been hypothesized as a possibly useful parameter in monitoring preclinical diabetic nephropathy. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method has been developed, based on a sandwich technique with subclass-specific antiimmunoglobulin monoclonal antibodies, which detects about 2 ng/mL IgG4. A sensitive radioimmunoassay method has been used to detect IgG. Normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric, and macroalbuminuric patients, together with normal control subjects, were included in the cross-sectional study. Whereas IgG levels were elevated, as expected, in macroalbuminuric patients, it was interesting to note that IgG4, but not total IgG, levels were elevated in microalbuminuric patients. The IgG4/IgG ratio was increased almost to the same extent in microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients. These findings are strongly in favor of the selective elimination of the acid medium-sized protein, IgG4, in incipient diabetic nephropathy. The measurement of immunoglobulin subclasses in the urine appears to be a promising parameter to characterize and subgroup diabetic patients with preclinical diabetic nephropathy.\r"

At last examination all treated patients had normal urinalysis and serum creatinine level. Follow-up biopsies showed stable or improved glomerular histology in three of four patients. One patient had a slight worsening of the interstitial disease. No steroid toxicity was observed. The outcome of these treated patients was compared with that of 15 comparable patients from another center who received no treatment and with patients from two published clinical pathology series. A normal urinalysis was found at follow-up in all treated patients, compared with one of 15 untreated patients (P = 0.003). None of the patients in the published series with comparable disease had normal urinalysis at follow-up. End-stage renal disease or renal insufficiency occurred in seven of 15 untreated and no treated patients (P = 0.19). The data strongly support the need for a prospective control trial of prednisone therapy in IgAN.\r"

Patient cardiac status was assessed by echocardiography. A deferroxamine (DFO) test, together with a bone biopsy, was performed to determine the magnitude of AI accumulation. Thus, an increase in serum AI after DFO (delta AI DFO) and stainable cortical bone aluminum (SCBA) were taken as parameters of AI load. Fourteen of 50 patients had no SCBA. They differed from the 36 patients with SCBA in that they had lower left ventricular mass (LVM) (P less than 0.001), increased velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) (P less than 0.001), and higher mitral E-F slope (P less than 0.01). In the overall population there was a mild increment in serum AI and in delta AI DFO. The duration of dialysis treatment was correlated with SCBA and delta AI DFO (P less than 0.001). A correlation was observed between LVM and delta AI DFO (P less than 0.001) and between LVM and SCBA (P less than 0.001). Multivariate correlations analysis indicated that these relationships were independent of the duration of dialysis treatment. The present data suggest that, in hemodialysis patients aluminum accumulation may be associated with increased LVM.\r"
