  ".W": "This study investigated the effects of cyclosporin (Cs) on insulin secretion and synthesis from the endocrine pancreas. With in vitro perfused pancreases from control and Cs-treated rats (1, 5, 10, or 25 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 2 wk), a dose-response relationship between Cs dose and inhibition of insulin secretion was demonstrated. Examination of the dynamic secretory response to a glucose stimulus (200 mg/dl) over a 3-h perfusion revealed an inhibition of all three secretory phases. Similarly, the ability of the pancreases to synthesize insulin decreased as a function of Cs dose. Reversibility of Cs toxicity on the pancreas was established by 2 wk after cessation of treatment. To evaluate the effect of Cs treatment in vivo, intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed. Rats treated with 25 mg.kg-1.day-1 Cs for 2 wk had significantly lower k values (slope of log glucose concentration over time) than controls. At 10 mg.kg-1.day-1, although curves that appeared abnormal were observed, k values were not significantly different from those of controls. In summary, this study demonstrates the profound inhibitory effect of Cs on the endocrine pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) in diabetic gonadal axis disorders, the MBHs of adult male streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats were examined after incubation in basal conditions or in K+-enriched medium and compared with those of controls. Diabetes lasted 1 mo. Both luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) release and MBH morphology were studied. After incubation in basal conditions, the LHRH release was unchanged. By light microscopy, the dilated-axon cross sections were more numerous (P less than .01) in the basal arcuate nucleus and in the median eminence. By electron microscopy, the ratio of exocytoses to neurosecretory granules observed in the median eminence axon cross sections was smaller (P less than .05). The total LHRH immunoreactivity, the number of labeled axons, and the amount of positive material in the axons were reduced (P less than .05). After incubation in K+-enriched medium, the LHRH release was markedly reduced (P less than .01). The number and area of dilated-axon cross sections, possibly because of the relation between exocytosis and physiological dilation, were less augmented (P less than .01). Whereas the number of exocytoses and the ratio of exocytoses to neurosecretory granules were not decreased, the total LHRH immunoreactivity and the number of labeled axons were reduced (P less than .05). The releasable LHRH pool therefore seems to be exhausted in control MBH because of long-term stimulation and reduced in the MBH of STZ-D rats because of diabetes. In conclusion, STZ-D causes functional and anatomical MBH lesions that should be pathogenetically relevant for the disorders of the gonadal axis documented in this animal model.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the abnormalities of glucose homeostasis and insulin action early in the course of human obesity, we studied in vivo glucose kinetics in seven children who were recently massively overweight. At time of study they were gaining weight at a rate of 13.5 +/- 1.4 kg/yr. They were compared with six age-matched control subjects. Six adults with long-term obesity and five normal adults were studied in parallel. The obese children and adults were normoglycemic and hyperinsulinemic. We found that glucose production and utilization were remarkably higher in obese children (295 +/- 18 mg/min; 7.6 mg.kg-1 lean body mass.min-1) than in control children (129 +/- 13 mg/min; 4.4 mg.kg-1 lean body mass.min-1, P less than .01) and obese adults (151 +/- 8 mg/min; 3.1 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1 lean body mass.min-1, P less than .01). Obese adults had normal rates of glucose production and utilization. Insulin- and non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake, estimated with somatostatin-induced suppression of endogenous insulin secretion, contributed almost equally to the excess glucose utilization observed in the obese children. When studied with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, obese children could not increase glucose disposal to the same extent as normal children and were not able to adequately suppress their endogenous glucose production. Recently obese children are therefore characterized by an increased basal glucose turnover rate and an already established insulin resistance of the liver and probably the skeletal muscles.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the exercise-induced fall in insulin in fat metabolism was studied in dogs during 150 min of treadmill exercise alone (controls) or with insulin clamped at basal levels by an intraportal infusion to prevent the normal fall in insulin concentration (ICs). To counteract the suppressive effect of insulin on glucagon release, glucagon was supplemented by an intraportal infusion in ICs. In all dogs, catheters were placed in a carotid artery and in the portal and hepatic veins for sampling and in the vena cava and the splenic vein for infusion purposes. Glucose levels were clamped in ICs to recreate the glycemic response evident in controls. In controls, insulin fell by 7 +/- 1 microU/ml but was unchanged from basal levels in ICs (0 +/- 2 microU/ml). Glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol rose similarly in controls and ICs. Arterial free-fatty acid (FFA) levels rose by 644 +/- 126 mu eq/L in controls but did not increase in ICs (-12 +/- 148 mu eq/L). Arterial glycerol levels rose by 337 +/- 43 and 183 +/- 19 microM in controls and ICs. Hepatic FFA delivery and fractional extraction increased by 17 +/- 3 and 0.06 +/- 0.02 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively, in controls. In ICs, hepatic FFA delivery increased by only 1 +/- 2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, whereas hepatic fractional extraction fell slightly (-0.03 +/- 0.03). Consequently, net hepatic FFA uptake rose by 4.8 +/- 1.5 mumol.kg-1.min-1 in controls but decreased slightly in ICs (-0.5 +/- 1.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89171639\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence that fenfluramine improves insulin action independently of its anorectic and weight-loss-inducing properties. Chronic d-fenfluramine also reduces hypothalamic noradrenergic tone, which correlates highly with hepatic glucose output. We report that chronic d-fenfluramine (5 mg.kg-1.day-1) ameliorates insulin resistance induced by high-fat feeding. Insulin action was assessed in adult male rats at basal insulin levels and at hyperinsulinemia (approximately 140 mU/L with the euglycemic clamp technique). Hepatic glucose production, peripheral glucose disposal, and individual tissue glucose metabolism were determined from bolus injections of [3H]-2-deoxyglucose and [14C]glucose. Food intake was matched between groups. Basal glucose turnover was reduced 28% (P less than .05) in fat-fed rats receiving d-fenfluramine (fat + fen). The glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia was 22.0 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 in the high-carbohydrate-fed rats, 8.2 +/- 1.0 in fat-fed rats, and 15.1 +/- 0.5 in the fat + fen group. Peripheral glucose disposal, reflecting measured skeletal muscle changes, was reduced by fat feeding (from 23.5 +/- 1.0 to 13.8 +/- 0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1) but was improved by d-fenfluramine (16.9 +/- 0.5, P less than .05 vs. fat fed). Impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output by insulin, caused by fat feeding, was totally reversed by d-fenfluramine. Thus, d-fenfluramine counteracted diet-induced insulin resistance, with the predominant effect on the liver. We hypothesize that d-fenfluramine improves insulin action by reducing hypothalamic noradrenergic tone, which in turn reduces the neural drive to hepatic glucose output and improves the hepatic response to insulin.\r"

Although each recipient had end-stage diabetic nephropathy with his/her own kidneys, there was marked variability in the rate of development of mesangial expansion observed in the transplanted kidneys. The progression of glomerular pathology, including widening of the glomerular basement membrane and expansion of the mesangium, did not correlate significantly with several potential risk factors (e.g., donor source--cadaver or living related, histocompatibility match, age of the recipient or donor, age at onset of diabetes, duration of diabetes before renal failure, immunosuppressive drug dose, blood pressure, and severity of lesions of chronic rejection). However, there was a direct albeit imprecise relationship between the index of mesangial expansion at the final biopsy and the index of glycemic control (r = .61, P less than .01). These observations suggest that currently unknown factor(s) may modulate the progression of diabetic renal disease, even in a population that had uniformly demonstrated nephropathy risk. Our data support the hypothesis that in addition to glycemic control per se, there are risk factors intrinsic to the kidney itself.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamine-induced lipolysis was investigated in adipocytes obtained before and after 30 min of exercise from 10 insulin-treated type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic men and 10 male matched control subjects. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated antilipolytic effect of catecholamines was normal, but the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolytic sensitivity was increased 10-fold (P less than .01) in diabetic subjects before and after exercise. The latter correlated inversely (r greater than .7) with the circulating norepinephrine level, which was significantly reduced in diabetic subjects. Basal lipolysis and lipolysis activated at different steps distal to the beta-receptor were similar in the two groups. There was no major change in the total number of beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors in the diabetic patients. However, the proportion of high-affinity beta-adrenoceptors was significantly increased in these patients compared with control subjects. In the diabetic patients, approximately 50% of the beta-adrenoceptors were in a high-affinity state, compared to approximately 30% in the control subjects (P less than .025). In diabetic subjects there was an enhanced plasma glycerol response to exercise, despite a blunted plasma norepinephrine response. The data suggest enhanced sensitivity of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in type I diabetes due to an increase in the number of high-affinity (i.e., coupled) beta-adrenoceptors in fat cells. This mechanism may be due to low levels of circulating norepinephrine and may also explain the exaggerated lipolytic response to exercise in the diabetic state.\r"

Ultrasound images of the gut wall correlate with histologic structure. This probe overcomes some of the problems associated with the combined ultrasound endoscopes now in use.

The aim of this work was to study immunohistochemical H- and L-ferritin distribution in duodenal mucosal cells of patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis, and of subjects with various degrees of iron loading. Biopsy sections of gastrointestinal mucosa from 24 patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis, 10 patients with secondary iron overload, 6 normal subjects, and 13 iron-deficient subjects were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies for the presence of immunohistochemical H and L ferritin types, and with Perls' stain for hemosiderin. Ferritin content of duodenal homogenates was evaluated in 5 cases. The absorptive duodenal cells were found to contain ferritin, mostly of the L type, in apical granules; these ferritin granules were present in all normal, iron-deficient, and iron-over-loaded subjects, but were absent in 21 (87%) of the patients with established idiopathic hemochromatosis. In cells other than those of the duodenal epithelium, such as lamina propria or antral mucosa, ferritin and hemosiderin contents were related to iron loading and no difference was evident between primary and secondary iron overload. These findings indicate that (a) idiopathic hemochromatosis is associated with an altered ferritin expression in the duodenal absorptive epithelial cells, (b) this alteration cannot be detected by analysis of duodenal homogenates, (c) idiopathic hemochromatosis does not affect ferritin accumulation in the other cell types analyzed, and (d) ferritin in absorptive duodenal cells may have a regulatory role in iron absorption.\r"

In this model, as in others, bacterial adherence to the microvillous membranes occurred in two morphologically distinct stages. Initial attachment of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli to ileal mucosa appeared to be a goblet cells and the mucous layer covering the microvilli. The next stage involved binding of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli to the bases of the microvilli that became elongated and vesiculated. Eventually, large areas of brush border effacement occurred with close apposition between bacterial and enterocyte membranes, leading to cup and pedestal formation. With a relatively large inoculum of bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) these changes occurred within 4 h, but even with much lower inocula (10(5) cfu/ml) localized areas of damage were seen within 8 h. Although the bacteriostatic antibiotic tetracycline (700 mg/L) inhibited bacterial replication, it did not prevent the characteristic damage produced by enteropathogenic strains of E. coli. Enteropathogenic strains of E. coli 0111 were able to produce attaching effacement to gastric, duodenal, jejunal, ileal, and colonic mucosa.\r"

The intraduodenal instillation of the protease inhibitor camostate reduced enzymatic activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin by 80%. This was accompanied by a strong increase in amylase and lipase output. The intravenous infusion of atropine (5 micrograms/kg.h) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of camostate on enzyme output. The infusion of loxiglumide (10 mg/kg.h) caused no changes in camostate-induced stimulation of enzyme output. Plasma levels of cholecystokinin were not altered after intraduodenal instillation of camostate whether atropine, loxiglumide, or saline were infused. We suggest that the protease inhibitor camostate, by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin, interferes with feedback regulation of basal pancreatic secretion in humans, and this mechanism is predominantly mediated by the cholinergic system.\r"

This 6-wk trial used an arbaprostil dose of 10 micrograms q.i.d., which has little gastric acid antisecretory activity. Endoscopies were performed after 21 and 42 days of treatment, at which times the arbaprostil and placebo healing rates, respectively, were 6/59 (10.2%) and 4/53 (7.6%) on day 21 and 25/59 (42.4%) and 16/50 (32.0%) on day 42. No significant differences between the treatment groups were found for pain relief, antacid consumption, and mucosal healing. This trial documents that a 10-micrograms dose of arbaprostil (which may be considered cytoprotective because of its small effect on gastric acid secretion), although safe and associated with no side effects, is not efficacious in healing acute gastric ulcers.\r"

Up to 50% of patients claiming weight loss will not have their complaint corroborated by medical records or family members. Since modest weight loss may occur as a physiologic change with advancing age, the practicing physician must have a working definition of pathologic weight loss that triggers an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. After a careful initial history, physical exam, and a limited laboratory test battery, physicians will identify most patients with physical causes for weight loss. Like many other geriatric syndromes, weight loss may require the identification and correction of multiple contributing factors.\r"

It is well accepted that sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most frequent by-products of the aging process, with prevalence ranging from 30 to 50%. The hearing loss and resulting difficulty understanding speech can have a negative effect on the quality of one's daily activities and, hence, can interfere with the enjoyment of an elderly individual's remaining years. The myths of \"hearing loss as an inevitable part of aging\" no longer prevail, however. Advances in biomedical technology have enabled the development of smaller hearing aids with wide fitting ranges, making hearing aids a realistic option for the majority of elderly hearing-impaired individuals. To maximize benefit from hearing aids, the elderly must be identified early via routine hearing screening and referred to an audiologist for evaluation and management.\r"

In those with combined systolic/diastolic hypertension, blood pressure reduction significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Secondary causes of hypertension, particularly renovascular, should be considered in elderly patients with a recent history of hypertension. Because of their proven efficacy and low cost, low-dose thiazide diuretics remain an important first-line therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blocking agents have also been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in the elderly. Increased attention is being paid to adverse drug effects and to the overall effect of antihypertensive therapy on quality of life. ACE inhibitors are particularly attractive in the elderly due to their possibilities in this area. In the elderly, the combination of a low-dose thiazide diuretic with an ACE inhibitor enhances antihypertensive efficacy while blunting the adverse metabolic effects of the diuretic.\r"

This was very profound in the group that died within 5 days (0.09 +/- 0.01 hr-1) and was significantly different from the group that survived (0.16 +/- 0.01 hr-1). There appears to be a critical value of the elimination rate constant (= 0.12 hr-1) which predicts death within 5 days.

Renal transplant patients had a decreased mean (+/- S.D.) galactose elimination capacity at 1 month (6.26 +/- 0.94 mg per min x kg) and at 1 year (5.93 +/- 0.96 mg per min x kg), when compared with a different group of 28 healthy control subjects (7.52 +/- 0.78 mg per min x kg, p less than 0.001) and a decreased total body clearance of prednisolone at 1 month (2.13 +/- 0.34 ml per min x kg vs. 2.71 +/- 0.43 ml per min x kg in controls, p less than 0.001), which further decreased over the following year to 1.76 +/- 0.32 ml per min x kg (p less than 0.001). The clearance of cyclosporine A declined significantly during the first year of successful transplantation (5.9 +/- 2.1 ml per min x kg vs. 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml per min x kg, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, a substantial proportion of stable renal transplant recipients have decreased cytosolic and microsomal liver functions despite the absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of significant liver disease.\r"

Intra-arterial hemodynamics were assessed by means of both continuous-wave Doppler signal spectrum analysis and multigate pulsed-wave Doppler flow velocity profile processing. Diminished peak frequencies throughout the carotid system and enlargement of the lumen diameter in the common carotid artery and the carotid bulb were major findings and were suspected to be due to cerebral autoregulation at high levels of intracranial vascular resistance. In the internal carotid artery of pure muscular type, the lumen diameter was diminished so the carotid bulb became an area of structural and hemodynamic transition. As a consequence, flow irregularities already observed in this region before surgery considerably increased during hypertension. In addition, endothelial disarray and leucocytic adherence and activation were associated with these hemodynamic alterations within the carotid bulb. Their mutual role in early atherogenesis is discussed.\r"

In a prior study, 72 hours of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) partially corrected this subnormal aldosterone response to Ang II in patients with non-modulating hypertension. Since it was uncertain whether the failure to restore normal adrenal responsiveness reflected a continued abnormality or an insufficient duration of CEI, the present study was performed wherein subjects were studied before CEI and then 72 hours and 6 weeks after CEI. Adrenal and renovascular responses were assessed in 13 subjects with normal- or high-renin hypertension in response to an infusion of Ang II (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 ng/kg/min) in balance on a 10 meq Na+/100 meq K+ diet. Eight of 13 had a normal plasma aldosterone increment above control levels (greater than or equal to 15 ng/dl) and were classified as modulators; the remaining subjects (five of 13) were classified as non-modulators. Enalapril was then administered for 72 hours and 6 weeks, and the assessment of the Ang II dose-response relations was repeated. In the modulators, there was no change compared with levels before CEI in the aldosterone dose-response curve or threshold sensitivity to infused Ang II at either 3 days or 6 weeks after CEI administration. In the non-modulators, CEI for 72 hours partially restored aldosterone responsiveness, but more prolonged CEI for 6 weeks completely corrected the defect, restoring aldosterone responsiveness on a sodium-restricted diet to that seen in modulators and in normotensive control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Sixty case reports were included in the evaluation; 31 patients were treated with flunarizine and 29 with placebo. Flunarizine proved to be significantly superior in its effect on the intensity of pain and the typical concomitant symptoms of the attacks. Patients were classed as responders who displayed a reduction in pain intensity by at least 50% within 60 minutes after the administration of flunarizine. 23 patients (= 74.2%) were responders, including 11 patients being without pain after 60 minutes. In the placebo group the responder rate was 27.6% The fact that both groups were comparable in all respects should be emphasized. The tolerance of intravenously administered flunarizine was excellent and corresponded to that of placebo. Apart from a sedative effect reported by 9 patients there were no side-effects. The circulatory conditions remained largely stable. The result of this study seems to indicate that an intravenous injection of 20 mg flunarizine might represent a genuine alternative, and as regards tolerance even a superior one, to the parenteral administration of ergotamine in migraine attacks.\r"

  ".W": "Few topics generate as much misinformation and fear as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. As a result, many physicians and nurses believe that universal testing of hospitalized patients would decrease their risk of inadvertent exposure to undiagnosed carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Quite the contrary may be the case. Therefore, in this article the advantages and disadvantages of routine testing are examined in relationship to established risk factors for health care personnel. Realistic concerns are discussed and appropriate precautions are stressed, while some of the myths are dispelled. These include potential transmission of HIV by saliva and mosquito bites, and the superiority of one glove material over another.\r"

  ".W": "A diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a devastating experience, placing those with the syndrome at high risk for ineffective coping. During the acute stage of illness, when the patient is admitted to a critical care setting, a crisis can ensue and precipitate intense anxiety, anger, denial, depression, and even suicidal ideation. Although it is imperative that critical care nurses become proficient in accurately assessing, diagnosing, and treating the disease in individuals who have an increased risk of maladaptive coping, there is no systematic basis for assessing the coping of patients with AIDS. Our purpose is to present a theoretically based explanation of the coping experience of persons with AIDS and to delineate nursing interventions designed to deal with maladaptive responses. The early and deliberate assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of such responses by means of a full range of psychosocial interventions are needed to enhance the coping efforts of the patients and optimize their psychosocial adjustment.\r"

This article presents a brief overview of the anatomy of the epidural space and the physiology of pain transmission, including the action of narcotics in pain relief. The importance of written nursing protocols and in-service education for nursing staff members is discussed as being a necessary prerequisite for the safe use of epidural analgesia. A flow diagram with rationale illustrates the epidural injection technique. Nursing care of patients receiving epidural narcotics is detailed. The discussion emphasizes the management of potential side effects from epidural narcotics (respiratory depression, urinary retention, pruritus, pain on injection, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting) and includes information on the use of a narcotic antagonist. Recommendations are made for preoperative and postoperative teaching of the patient and family. A variety of tools for assessing patients' pain levels are described, and a comprehensive nursing care plan with nursing diagnoses and nursing interventions is provided.\r"

Four psychologic preparatory strategies designed to reduce anxiety and enhance adaptation were compared with an attention placebo control intervention. Sixty adult patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization were randomly assigned to one of five groups: sensory-procedural information, modeling, cognitive-behavioral coping skills, modeling plus coping skills, or attention placebo control. Subjects' reactions to cardiac catheterization were assessed by using self-report, behavioral, and physiologic measures. Results indicated that subjects in the modeling and modeling plus coping skills groups were rated as less anxious and better adjusted during the catheterization than control subjects. Compared with controls, subjects in the two modeling groups also reported less subjective anxiety and greater perceived coping ability during the catheterization. All subjects who received a preparatory treatment demonstrated lower levels of autonomic arousal both during and after the test than did control subjects. The results support the efficacy of preparatory strategies that include a patient model.\r"

Although congenital tracheal stenosis carries a high mortality rate, advances in surgical treatment have increased the likelihood of survival, and these patients are seen with increasing frequency in intensive care units. The surgical options available are dilation, resection, and tracheoplasty. Because of the lack of a prosthetic replacement, resection is generally limited to lesions involving less then one third of the trachea. Tracheoplasty with a variety of graft materials has, in some cases, been successful in increasing the diameter of the stenotic trachea. Postoperative care involves maintaining paralysis and sedation until healing is established, with close attention to preventing complications. The needs of the family are addressed through teaching and support. A case of successful tracheal reconstruction, by use of an autologous cartilage graft, in a 14-day-old infant with severe stenosis from just below the vocal cords extending to the hilum is presented.\r"

Four landmark studies that contributed new knowledge or changed practice are discussed. In addition, questions suggesting areas for future research are listed.\r"

The syndrome presents as a delayed pleural or pericardial reaction, characterized by fever, chest pain, and a friction rub. Although symptoms often identify PPS, diagnosis may be aided by the use of radiography, echocardiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory analysis. PPS can cause considerable discomfort and anxiety. Furthermore, patients are at risk of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. For these reasons and because the complication often extends hospitalization, health care professionals must familiarize themselves with the syndrome, recognize signs and symptoms early, and plan interventions accordingly.\r"

However, after a longer follow-up, a satisfactory result was achieved in only twenty-eight shoulders (approximately 50 per cent). About one-third of the shoulders continued to be pain-free, and in eight shoulders (15 per cent) an additional operation was performed.

Four groups of subjects were examined: healthy young and elderly controls (groups A and B) and patients with intermittent claudication or critical ischaemia (groups C and D). The occlusion tourniquet was placed just proximal to the patella, and measurements were performed on the toe pulp (study 1) and leg skin (study 2). The hyperaemic response on both pulp and leg skin was delayed, diminished and prolonged in claudicators compared with controls. On the toe pulp most patients with critical ischaemia had no hyperaemic response at all, indicating that the local vasodilatory capacity was exhausted at rest. The time from tourniquet deflation to pulp peak hyperaemia was the parameter that most clearly separated between the groups [Group A: 21.5 secs (median), group B: 17 secs, group C: 73 secs and group D: greater than 300 secs]. The time from tourniquet deflation to the first increase in flux is probably dependent on hemodynamic factors in the large extremity vessels, and it is possible that this parameter could be used to define levels of hemodynamic significant stenosis in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. The results also indicate that laser Doppler flowmetry performed during stress testing may be of value in determining appropriate amputation levels.\r"

Salmonella species, which are especially potent pathogens, often are the infecting organisms. A high index of suspicion is the cornerstone of diagnosis. Patients with salmonella cultured from the sputum, blood, or urine without adequate explanation must be suspected of intravascular infection. Surgical intervention with adjuvant ampicillin therapy should be expediently initiated after diagnosis. Provided no gross infection exists and prompt debridement and drainage are obtained, an \"in situ\" interposition graft is adequate. A ring graft has the advantage of allowing a shorter cross clamp time and eliminates the risks inherent in contaminated anastomotic suture lines. Prolonged, possibly life-long, antibiotic therapy offers the best prognosis for this disease after surgical repair.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure is a common clinical syndrome, with a relatively poor prognosis in its advanced stages. During the development of heart failure, there is a decline in myocardial contractility and activation of neurohormonal systems. An overshoot of some of these compensatory mechanisms sets the stage for therapeutic interventions. Any of the three therapeutic classes of drugs (inotropic drugs, diuretics or vasodilators) can be used as first-line therapy. Other classes can be added to produce additive effects on ventricular function. Because vasodilators have been shown to prolong life, they should be used routinely in patients with heart failure. Arrhythmias and sudden death are relatively common in heart failure, although the value of antiarrhythmic therapy is less certain. Although current therapy is very helpful in patients with heart failure, it is clear that preventive approaches will be more effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "A family is described in which nine members over two generations had an aortic dissecting aneurysm or aortic or arterial dilation at a young age. The family has been followed up since 1977 after the death of a second teenager from a kindred of 11. None of the patients had the Marfan syndrome or a history of systemic hypertension. Three members died of ruptured aortic dissecting aneurysm and acute hemopericardium at 14, 18 and 24 years of age, respectively; a fourth member died suddenly at age 48 years, a few years after aortic repair for aneurysmal dilation. One member underwent surgical repair of an ascending aortic dissecting aneurysm at age 18 years and is still alive. Four members are currently under close medical observation for aortic or arterial dilation. Histologic examination of the aortic wall at autopsy or surgery in three patients revealed a loss of elastic fibers, deposition of mucopolysaccharide-like material in the media and cystic medial changes. Types I and III collagen from cultured fibroblasts appeared normal on gel electrophoresis. Results of indirect immunofluorescent studies of the elastin-associated microfibrillar fiber array in skin and fibroblast culture from multiple family members were also normal. This dramatic familial cluster of aortic dissecting aneurysm and aortic or arterial dilation suggests a genetically determined disease of autosomal dominant inheritance although the basic defect remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-four patients with primary systemic amyloidosis-53 with two-dimensional echocardiographic features of cardiac involvement (Group I) and 11 without cardiac involvement (Group II)--underwent Doppler echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular diastolic function. Pulsed wave Doppler recordings of left ventricular inflow velocities and pulmonary vein flow velocities with respiratory monitoring in these patients were compared with findings in a normal group. Patients in Group I showed striking abnormalities of left ventricular diastolic filling when classified into subgroups by mean left ventricular wall thickness: early greater than 12 but less than 15 mm; advanced greater than or equal to 15 mm. In early amyloidosis, relaxation was abnormal, with decreased peak early velocity (75 +/- 20 versus 86 +/- 16 cm/s; p less than 0.01), increased late velocity (71 +/- 22 versus 56 +/- 13 cm/s; p less than 0.01), decreased early to late velocity ratio (1.2 +/- 0.6 versus 1.6 +/- 0.5; p less than 0.01) and prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (87 +/- 15 versus 73 +/- 13 ms; p less than 0.01) compared with normal values. In advanced amyloidosis, there was a restrictive filling pattern with a markedly shortened deceleration time (148 +/- 50 versus 199 +/- 32 ms; p less than 0.001), decreased pulmonary vein peak systolic flow velocity (34 +/- 16 versus 54 +/- 12 cm/s; p less than 0.01) and increased diastolic flow velocity (55 +/- 20 versus 44 +/- 12 cm/s; p less than 0.01) compared with normal values. Group and the subgroup with early amyloidosis had similar flow velocity patterns. Thus, this study documents that in cardiac amyloidosis, a spectrum of diastolic filling abnormalities exists; the restrictive filling pattern is seen only in the advanced stages.\r"

  ".U": "89175856\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of balloon size on the success of coronary angioplasty was studied to develop quantitative criteria for optimal selection of balloon size. Coronary dimensions of 165 stenotic lesions were measured by computer-assisted cinevideodensitometry in 120 patients who had undergone angioplasty with a balloon selected by visual estimates. Cross-sectional areas and diameters of normal and stenotic arterial segments were measured before and after angioplasty by a previously validated cinevideodensitometric technique. The diameter of the inflated balloon compared with that of the normal arterial segment was expressed as a ratio for sizing balloons. Oversized balloons with a ratio greater than 1.3 (n = 35) caused a high (37%) incidence of dissection, with three severely compromised arterial lumens. Undersized balloons with a ratio less than 0.9 (n = 29) often resulted in significant (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) residual stenotic lesions (21%) and a significantly (p less than 0.05) higher rate of repeat angioplasty for restenosis. Selection of balloon sizes with ratios in the 0.9 to 1.3 range (n = 101) resulted in a low (4%) incidence of dissection with few patients (3%) having significant residual stenosis. Mean residual stenosis (percent diameter reduction) was most severe for undersized (35.0 +/- 18%) or oversized (23.1 +/- 19%) balloons and least severe for balloons with a ratio of 0.9 to 1.3 (18.7 +/- 14%) (p less than 0.001). Repeat angioplasty for restenosis was more frequently required (p less than 0.05) for lesions dilated with undersized balloons. Thus, selection of angioplasty balloons that approximate or slightly exceed the diameter of the normal arterial diameter yields optimal angiographic results with minimal dissections and minimal residual stenotic lesions.\r"

However, as early diagnosis, aggressive therapy and better supportive care become increasingly available, with consequently longer survival rates, cardiac lesions other than those due to opportunistic infections or malignancy should be seen. Cardiac complications are described in terms of the pathologic lesions, the clinical manifestations that ensue as a result of the pathologic lesions and the cardiac abnormalities that can occur from administration of the various therapeutic agents in the syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "89175873\r", 
  ".W": "The spatial distribution of simulated regurgitant jets imaged by Doppler color flow mapping was evaluated under constant flow and pulsatile flow conditions. Jets were simulated through latex tubings of 3.2, 4.8, 6.35 and 7.9 mm by varying flow rates from 137 to 1,260 cc/min. Color jet area was linearly related to flow rate at each orifice (r = 0.96, SEE = 3.4; r = 0.99, SEE = 1.6; r = 0.97, SEE = 2.3; r = 0.97, SEE = 3.2, respectively), but significantly higher flow rates were required to maintain the same maximal spatial distribution of the jet at the larger regurgitant orifices. Constant flow jets were also simulated through needle orifices of 0.2, 0.5 and 1 mm, with a known total volume (5 cc) injected at varying flow rates and with differing absolute volumes injected at the same flow rate (0.2, 1.0 and 2.0 cc/s, respectively). Again, maximal color jet area was linearly related to flow rate at each orifice (r = 0.97, SEE = 2.3; r = 0.97, SEE = 2.4; r = 0.92, SEE = 3.9, respectively), but was not related to the absolute volume of regurgitation. Color encoding of regurgitant jets on Doppler color flow maps was demonstrated to be highly dependent on velocity and, hence, driving pressure, such that color encoding was obtained from a constant flow jet injected at a velocity of 4 m/s through an orifice of 0.04 mm diameter with flow rates as low as 0.008 cc/s. Mitral regurgitant jets were also simulated in a physiologic in vitro pulsatile flow model through three prosthetic valves with known regurgitant orifice sizes (0.2, 0.6 and 2.0 mm2). For each regurgitant orifice size, color jet area at each was linearly related to a regurgitant pressure drop (r = 0.98, SEE = 0.15; r = 0.97, SEE = 0.20; r = 0.97, SEE = 0.23, respectively), regurgitant stroke volume (r = 0.77, SEE = 0.55; r = 0.94, SEE = 0.30; r = 0.91, SEE = 0.41, respectively) and peak regurgitant flow rate (r = 0.98, SEE = 0.16; r = 0.97, SEE = 0.21; r = 0.93, SEE = 0.37, respectively), but the spatial distribution of the regurgitant jets was most highly dependent on the regurgitant pressure drop. Jet kinetic energy calculated from the summation of the individual pixel intensities integrated over the jet area was closely related to driving pressure (r = 0.84), but integration of the power mode area times pixel intensities provided the best estimation of regurgitant stroke volume (r = 0.80).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred thirty-one patients with a first acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated within 5 h after the onset of symptoms either to treatment with anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), 30 U over 5 min, or to conventional heparin therapy, 5,000 IU in a bolus injection. Heparin was reintroduced in both groups 4 h after initial therapy at a dosage of 500 IU/kg per day. One hundred twelve patients received APSAC and 119 received heparin within a mean period of 188 +/- 62 min after the onset of symptoms. Both groups were similar in age, location of the acute myocardial infarction, Killip functional class and time of randomization. Elective coronary arteriography was performed on an average of 4 +/- 1.2 days after initial therapy. Follow-up radionuclide angiography and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography were performed before hospital discharge. Infarct size was estimated from single photon emission computed tomography and expressed as a percent of total myocardial volume. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 77% in the APSAC group and 36% in the heparin group (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction determined from contrast angiography was significantly higher in the APSAC group than in the heparin group. This was true for the entire study group (0.53 +/- 0.13 versus 0.47 +/- 0.12; p = 0.002) as well as for the subgroups of patients with anterior and inferior wall infarction (0.47 +/- 0.13 versus 0.40 +/- 0.11; p = 0.04 and 0.56 +/- 0.10 versus 0.51 +/- 0.11; p = 0.02, respectively). At 3 weeks, the difference remained significant for the anterior myocardial infarction subgroup. A significant 31% reduction in infarct size was found in the APSAC group (33% for the anterior infarction subgroup [p less than 0.05] and 16% for the inferior infarction subgroup [p = NS]). A close inverse relation was found between the values of left ventricular ejection fraction and infarct size (r = -0.73, p less than 0.01). By the end of a 3 week follow-up period, seven APSAC-treated patients and six heparin-treated patients had died. In conclusion, the early infusion of APSAC in acute myocardial infarction produced a high early patency rate, significant limitation of infarct size and significant preservation of left ventricular systolic function, mainly in anterior wall infarction.\r"

They were treated with increasing doses of freeze-dried birch-pollen antigens for 16 months, reaching a cumulative dose of 280 x 10(6) biologic units. This is about 200 times more than the dose used in conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy (IT). In the placebo-treated group, but not in the actively treated group, there was a rise in postseasonal birch-specific IgE antibody levels. A significant decline in postseasonal values after 1 year of treatment was recorded in the actively treated, but not in the placebo-treated, group. Compared to the placebo treatment, there was a significant rise in birch-specific IgG antibodies in patients administered active treatment; however, the rise was less than that usually observed during subcutaneous IT. No significant change in birch-specific serum IgA was found in either group. The changes in IgE and IgG antibody levels demonstrate that OIT affects the immune system. This supports our recent findings that OIT demonstrates a beneficial effect in the treatment of birch pollinosis in adults. But, as with subcutaneous IT, there was no clear relationship between antibody response and clinical findings in the patients. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the relief of symptoms thus remain unknown.\r"

The dose-ranging study in 30 patients indicated that similar single doses of albuterol aerosol and powder had comparable effects with the intermediate doses (i.e., 180 micrograms of aerosol and 200 micrograms of powder) providing effective bronchodilation with minimal adverse effects. In the subsequent 12-week, parallel-group study, 204 children received albuterol as either aerosol, 180 micrograms, or powder, 200 micrograms four times a day. Both formulations were equally effective with no untoward cardiovascular effects and only one incident of mild tremor. Among those children who expressed a preference for one of the delivery systems, significantly more children preferred the powder (44% versus 26%, p less than 0.01).

Traumatic destruction of tissue barriers, the placement of various tubes and drains, and surgical repair with debridement all provide conduits for colonization and infection with pathogens. Many components of the host immune system also become altered after trauma and surgery, predisposing this population to infectious complications. The site of infection can be cryptic in the moribund trauma patient; locating it may require many special diagnostic procedures. Continuing close surveillance is important to prevent or to identify infections at the earliest possible time. The liberal use of antibiotics should be discouraged so that development of resistant organisms and superinfection is kept to a minimum. Handwashing between patient contacts may be the most important prophylaxis against the spread of pathogens within a trauma unit.\r"

Here we used a large panel of protease inhibitors to determine the role of each of the four classes of proteases in antigen processing. Moreover, we asked whether different proteases were necessary for presentation of different known epitopes, defined by three Th cell clones. For all three epitopes of myoglobin, intracellular thiol proteases such as cathepsins B or L were the only proteases necessary. Furthermore, myoglobin pre-digested with cathepsin B could be presented to all three clones without further processing. Thus, a single protease may be both necessary and sufficient for Ag processing to present the majority of epitopes, at least for myoglobin. This finding provides an explanation of earlier data on the fragments produced from processed myoglobin, and so may contribute to a much needed solution to the long standing problem of predicting where a protein will be cleaved during processing.\r"

The frequency of IgA-binding mononuclear cells was approximately 13% in blood and spleen samples but less than 1% in tonsil samples. IgA binding could be visualized by flow immunocytometry on monocyte/macrophages, but not on T and B cells. IgA polymers were bound better than IgA dimers and monomers. Nonhomologous IgA myelomas of both IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses inhibited the IgA-binding to monocytes, whereas aggregated normal serum IgG, IgM paraproteins, and an IgG myeloma did not. IgA binding was relatively insensitive to changes in temperature or cation concentration. IgA-binding monocytes were found in IgA-deficient patients at the same frequency as in normal individuals. The results indicate that monocytes constitutively express class-specific binding sites for both IgA1 and IgA2 molecules.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the contributions of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) and the complex of leukocyte surface adhesion molecules designated CD11/CD18 to the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to cultured human endothelial cells (HEC), activated by rIL-1 beta for 4 or 24 h. Inhibition of PMN attachment to IL-1-activated HEC was measured in a quantitative in vitro monolayer adhesion assay, after treatment with mAb directed to ELAM-1 (mAb H18/17), and to CD11a (mAb L11), CD11b (mAb 44), CD11c (mAb L29), and CD18 (mAb 10F12), alone or in combination. Pretreatment of activated HEC with mAb H18/7 inhibited PMN adhesion by 47 +/- 8% whereas control mAb had no effect. CD11/CD18-directed mAb significantly blocked PMN adhesion to activated HEC (anti-CD11a, 40 +/- 3%; anti-CD11b, 34 +/- 4%; anti-CD18, 78+/- 6% inhibition). The combination of mAb H18/7 and each of the various anti-CD11/CD18 mAb resulted in greater inhibition of PMN adhesion than any Mab alone. After 24 h of rIL-1 beta treatment, when ELAM-1 was markedly decreased but elevated PMN adhesion was still observed, mAb H18/7 had no effect on PMN adhesion. At this time, CD11/CD18-dependent adhesive mechanisms predominated and a CD11c-dependent mechanism became apparent (anti-CD11a, 67 +/- 4% inhibition; anti-CD11b, 45 +/- 9%; anti-CD11c, 26 +/- 6%; anti-CD18, 97 +/- 1%). In summary, PMN adhesion to IL-1-activated HEC involves both CD11/CD18-dependent mechanisms and an ELAM-1-dependent mechanism, and the relative contribution of these varies at different times of IL-1-induced HEC activation. The additive blocking observed at 4 h with mAb H18/7 in combination with CD11/CD18-directed Mab implies that members of the CD11/CD18 complex do not function as an obligate ligand(s) for ELAM-1.\r"

Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-gp600 antibody was used as the probe. Immunocytochemically in lung on light and electron microscopy the probe reacted exclusively with type II pneumocytes and no other lung cell. The reaction was also demonstrated on freshly isolated and cultured type II pneumocytes. Both approaches showed the reaction to localize on the cell membrane of type II pneumocytes. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled type II pneumocyte cell membranes identified two 270- to 290-kDa polypeptides as the reactive proteins. We conclude that the reactive epitopes for anti-gp600 in lung parenchyma are exclusively localized on type II pneumocytes and have a Mr of approximately 270 to 290 kDa and that anti-gp600 may be used as a specific immunologic marker for the type II pneumocytes. Finally, it is possible that the differences in the molecular forms of the cross-reactive proteins in lung and kidney identified in this report are the reason for the known non-nephritogenicity of rat lung for the induction of Heymann nephritis in rat.\r"

This is shown in the antibody-facilitated murine chimeras, in which conditioning consists of a single injection of anti-host MHC antibody, which results in long term hemopoietic engraftment in P----F1 and syngeneic donor-host combinations. The data establish that, in two independent situations, engraftment is reduced in hosts with elevated NS activity. Resistance to engraftment in antibody-conditioned adult hosts is increased by prior administration of CFA, which also increases NS activity. Likewise, neonatal animals, which are highly resistant to antibody-facilitated engraftment, exhibit a spontaneously-increased level of NS activity. This resistance declines with the ontogenic waning of splenic NS activity. Conversely, administration of facilitating antibody decreases host bone marrow NS activity, while anti-MHC antibodies that fail to facilitate engraftment do not reduce it. NK activity, on the other hand, correlates poorly with resistance or susceptibility to marrow engraftment in these situations. These results suggest that immunoregulatory functions associated with hemopoiesis may control engraftment of donor stem cells in unirradiated hosts.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that incubation with IL-2 can induce ADCC activity in murine cells and that this activity was mediated by asialo GM1+, FcR+ cells. In the present study we show that the cytokines IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 alpha are unable to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in murine cells; however, TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha could substantially augment the ADCC induced by IL-2. IL-1 increased the IL-2-induced ADCC activity in a dose-dependent fashion and in cells isolated from the thymus and spleen. The precursors of the ADCC induced by the combination of IL-1 and IL-2 were asialo GM1+ cells, similar to the precursor cells of IL-2-induced ADCC. The effect of IL-1 and TNF on ADCC was not the result of an increase in the FcR density on the cell surface or the result of an increase in the number of FcR+ cells although IL-1 increased the recovery of viable cells in culture. The main effect of IL-1 and TNF was the enhancement of the lytic ability of the IL-2 cultured cells as indicated by increased intra-cellular benzyloxycarbonyl L-lysine thiobenzylester-esterase activity. These results suggest that lymphokines such as IL-1 and TNF may synergize with IL-2 in the induction of ADCC and could thus potentially be useful for the immunotherapy of established tumors when combined with the administration of specific anti-tumor antibodies.\r"

The presence of CD14+ monocytes is, however, a prerequisite for the enhancing activity of CRF and AVP. The data presented here show that rIL-1 beta can replace CRF and AVP, whereas a mAb directed against IL-1 abrogates the response to CRF and AVP.

We have examined the effect of several anti-CD11b/18 mAb on phagocytosis of IgG (EIgG) or complement (EC4b) opsonized erythrocytes by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes. F(ab')2 of two mAb (IB4, an anti-beta-chain mAb and Mo-1 an anti-alpha-chain mAb), inhibited both phagocytosis of EIgG and phorbol ester-stimulated phagocytosis of EC4b by PMN and monocytes. These F(ab')2 inhibited the binding of EIgG to monocytes, but they had no effect on binding of EIgG to PMN, or EC4b to either phagocyte. In addition, IB4 inhibited phorbol-ester stimulated phagocytosis of sheep E opsonized with C component 3bi (EC3bi) without inhibiting rosetting of these same targets. These data separate the anti-phagocytic effect of these mAb from effects on phagocyte-target adherence. When PMN were adherent to an anti-CD11b/CD18 F(ab')2-coated surface, EC3bi binding was abolished, but phagocytosis of EIgG or EC4b was unaffected. Subsequent addition of fluid- phase IB4 or Mo-1 F(ab')2 inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG or EC4b by the adherent cells. This suggested that the CD11b/CD18 involved in C3bi rosetting were mobile in the membrane, whereas those involved in phagocytosis of EIgG or EC4b were not. Cytochalasin treatment of PMN during adherence to F(ab')2-coated plates decreased both apical expression of CD11b/18 and subsequent ingestion of EIgG by 70%, suggesting that microfilaments are important in maintaining immobile CD11b/18 on the apical PMN surface. We conclude that there are functionally distinct populations of CD11b/CD18 on monocytes and PMN: one involved in C3bi rosetting and another involved in the process of phagocytosis mediated via several different receptors. CD11b/18 is not required for optimal target binding in all cases, but is always required for ingestion. As with several other integrins, the CD11b/18 molecules involved in phagocytosis have a functional association with the cell cytoskeleton.\r"

To determine if human rIL-3 might also stimulate the growth of human mast cells, we cultured human bone marrow in the presence of human rIL-3 in suspension cultures, methylcellulose, and in \"interphase\" cultures where cells are layered over agar. The presence of mast cells was determined using a variety of histochemical techniques. In agreement with previous reports, basophil-like cells were identified in all culture systems. Mastlike cells were identified only in interphase cultures. By 3 wk, such cultures consisted of basophil-like cells (20 to 50%) and mastlike cells (1 to 5%). Cultures supplemented with rIL-4 showed no additional increase in basophil-like and mastlike cells. Both basophil-like and mastlike cells fluoresced with o-phthaldialdehyde and exhibited IgE receptors. Unlike basophil-like cells, mastlike cells were chloroacetate esterase, amidase, and human mast cell tryptase positive.

Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) generate O2- in response to zymosan but not PMA. However, the ability to generate O2- in response to PMA could be induced in BMM by pre-exposing the cells to certain cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IFN-gamma, and, to a lesser extent, IL-1 alpha. Bacterial LPS also induced the ability to respond to PMA. These same agents were also shown to prime RPM for enhanced PMA-induced respiratory burst. In contrast to GM-CSF, CSF-1 did not enhance the ability of BMM or RPM to generate O2- in response to PMA. Pretreatment with GM-CSF or TNF-alpha did not significantly affect the zymosan-induced release of O2- by BMM. These results suggest that unprimed BMM have a deficiency in the PMA-dependent signaling pathway that is corrected by exposure to selected cytokines. The results also raise the possibility that the basal ability of tissue macrophages to generate a respiratory burst in response to PMA may be a reflection of in vivo exposure to cytokines.\r"

Western blots were used to study the reactions of each mAb with human and rabbit cardiac and rabbit skeletal tropomyosins.

Five mAb were found which reacted with either PepM5 or ColiM6 protein and tropomyosin in Western blots or ELISA. Two of the tropomyosin positive mAb were also antinuclear antibodies and were inhibited with DNA. In Western blots of cardiac tropomyosins, the mAb reacted with either the 70-kDa dimer of tropomyosin, the 35-kDa monomer, or both. Some differences were observed in the reactions of the mAb with the different tropomyosins in Western blots.

This report constitutes the first evidence of serologic cross-reactivity between streptococcal M proteins and tropomyosins.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the importance of genes located in or near the Ig constant regions in regulating the human antibody response, we correlated Ig allotypic markers with total Ig concentrations and natural antibody concentrations to the streptococcal group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) in 193 healthy adult blood donors. The major correlations between Ig allotypes and total Ig and specific antibody concentrations were observed with the Gm(f;n;b) haplotype. When compared with Gm(f;n;b) negative individuals, Gm(f;n;b) positives had significantly higher concentrations of total IgG2 (p less than 0.001) and IgG2 anti A-CHO (p less than 0.05), lower concentrations of total IgG1 (p less than 0.001) and IgG1 anti A-CHO (p less than 0.001), and lower concentrations of total IgM (p less than 0.001) and IgM anti A-CHO (p less than 0.05). We conclude that individuals with the Gm(f;n;b) haplotype respond preferentially with IgG2 rather than IgG1 subclass antibodies. This increased capacity to respond with IgG2 antibodies may be reflected in the magnitude of the total antibody response when the IgG2 subclass comprises a major proportion of the response, as occurs in the adult response to many polysaccharide Ag.\r"

We report that the CD20 gene is located on human chromosome 11 at position q12-q13. The location of CD20 was determined by in situ hybridization and was further confirmed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent/human hybrids that contained only portions of human chromosome 11. This localization places the CD20 gene near the site of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation that is found in a subgroup of B cell-lineage malignancies. The site of this translocation has been previously identified by DNA cloning and termed bcl-1. The CD20 gene was found to lie on the centromeric side of bcl-1 on chromosome 11 and to be separated from bcl-1 by at least 50 kb of DNA. These results raise the possibility that alterations in the expression of the CD20 gene may result after the t(11;14) chromosomal alteration.\r"

There was no difference in the ability to retain antibodies to these viruses between patients with and those without chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Twenty seronegative patients without active chronic GVHD or ongoing immunosuppressive treatment were vaccinated with a live attenuated trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. No early or late side effects were detected after the vaccinations. The percentages of patients who seroconverted after vaccination were 77%, 64%, and 75% for measles, mumps, and rubella, respectively.

Antibody responses of 13 homosexual men with C. cinaedi infection demonstrated consistent reactions with five antigens (96-41 kDa). All human sera tested, including those of 10 culture-negative individuals, reacted with the C. cinaedi 59- and 64-kDa bands, but the overall responses of infected individuals were much stronger. The antigenic profiles of C. cinaedi and C. fennelliae can be used to distinguish these species from other Campylobacter species. At least six C. cinaedi antigens are immunogenic in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial dysentery due to Shigella sonnei remains a serious public health problem in developed countries, including Bulgaria. At the National Shigella Reference Laboratory in Sofia, 17,126 strains of S. sonnei from epidemics and sporadic cases collected from 1973 to 1987 were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility testing, phage typing, colicin typing, and biotyping were performed for all strains to allow intraspecies differentiation and to track any clonal distribution. Of all strains, 84.3% were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, the most frequent being tetracycline (Tet), streptomycin (Str), sulfonamide (Sul), chloramphenicol (Chl), ampicillin (Amp), and trimethoprim (Tmp). Resistance patterns most prevalent for successive 5-y periods included Tet, StrSulTet, and AmpChlStrSulTet, respectively. For the final 5 y, a new pattern (AmpKanStrSulTetTm [Kan = kanamycin]) was spread throughout the country by two trimethoprim-resistant clones. High-level resistance to trimethoprim (MIC greater than 1500 micrograms/mL) in both clones was determined by dihydrofolate reductase type I. The genes for trimethoprim resistance were located on a conjugative R-plasmid of approximately 145 kilobases which cotransferred all other antimicrobial resistances. A similar-sized R-plasmid had been found in earlier isolates of Bulgarian S. sonnei, suggesting that new antimicrobial resistance genes had been sequentially added to an ancestral R-plasmid. Controlling the expression of these new as well as older antimicrobial resistances, particularly for enteric pathogens, must involve reduction in usage of generic antimicrobial agents.\r"

Mucocutaneous disease (P less than .002) and L. braziliensis braziliensis infection (P less than .001) were independently associated with significantly higher IFAT titers and cutaneous DTH than were cutaneous disease or L. braziliensis panamensis infection. Lesion size was also correlated with IFAT titer (P. less than .001). Although time of lesion evolution was highly correlated with all parameters, differences associated with subspecies and disease form were independent of lesion duration (three-way analysis of variance). In contrast with the cutaneous DTH response, the in vitro lymphocyte proliferative response to Leishmania antigen did not correlate with disease form and only weakly with infecting subspecies when time of evolution and subspecies were controlled. The association of mucosal disease presentation with a particular subspecies and the independent correlation of both variables with heightened IFAT titers and cutaneous DTH to Leishmania antigen supports the possibility of immune mechanisms of pathogenesis in human tegumentary leishmaniasis.\r"

Antibodies to the streptococcal group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) antigen exposed on the particles were present in all preparations at high concentrations. In some preparations, anti-A-CHO consisted predominantly of either immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) or IgG2, whereas in others, both IgG subclasses were equally represented. Dilutions of the IVIGs and of a normal IgG reference preparation were adjusted for their anti-A-CHO content, incubated with streptococcal particles, and exposed to neutrophil granulocytes isolated from normal blood. The various IVIGs differed in their capacity to elicit chemiluminescence signals. Some preparations, particularly those consisting of chemically modified IgG molecules, showed little activity, whereas others were comparable to the reference preparation. We concluded that to some extent such differences could be related to the IgG subclass composition of the antibody. However, of greater importance were the manufacturing procedures by which both the antigen-binding fragment and crystallizable fragment portions, and thus the functional integrity of the IgG molecules, were more or less severely affected.\r"

Yet for the primary care physician and oncologist alike, misconceptions of the safety and efficacy of oral morphine along with lack of recognized guidelines for use have often resulted in inadequate cancer pain therapy. Use of controlled-release oral morphine sulfate (MSC) requires additional guidelines for optimum analgesia. Proposed are ten principles of dosing oral morphine, especially MSC, which were followed in a clinical trial involving cancer patients. MSC dosed at 8-, 10-, and 12-hour intervals was compared with immediate-release morphine (IRMS) dosed every four hours, and with prestudy analgesics. Patients achieved satisfactory analgesia at daily doses (mean +/- SE) of 118.0 +/- 8.6 mg and 111.4 +/- 12.6 mg (P greater than .05) for IRMS and MSC, respectively. Dosing endpoints were determined by titration with IRMS and MSC to a minimal and equivalent amount of supplemental short-acting analgesic. Side effects were typical for opioids and tolerated except for one dropout on IRMS (nausea and constipation). The ten principles have been incorporated into a dosing scheme as a practical guide for MSC therapy.\r"

The data set was randomly divided into derivation and validation sets. The dependent variable was self-reported seat belt use (percentage). Using multiple linear regression, the following rule was derived: score = [age (years) X 0.24] + [mood-affecting drug use X 4.09] + [miles driven per year X 5.08] + [education level X 11.18] - [race X 18.31] - [cigarette use X 2.73] - [satisfaction with life X 3.50] - [body mass (kg/m2) X 0.83] - [urban/rural residence X 4.08]. Likelihood ratios for persons stating 0 to 25 percent seat belt use were compared with those for persons stating 76 to 100 percent use. The prevalence of 0 to 25 percent seat belt use was 31 percent in the derivation set and 33 percent in the validation set. At the lowest quintile of score (-1 or less), the likelihood ratios were 4.18 and 3.31 in the derivation and validation sets, respectively. At the highest quintile of score (26 or more) the likelihood ratios were 0.29 and 0.38, respectively. At score levels less than 10 the decision rule had a sensitivity of 59 percent and 55 percent and a specificity of 80 percent and 81 percent in the derivation and validation sets, respectively. This decision rule may be used by primary care physicians to identify persons likely not to use seat belts and target them for health promotion efforts.\r"

This paper presents a literature review that summarizes the quality of care of family physicians by outcome and process measures. Studies in the literature are flawed by methodologic weaknesses, including the frequent lumping of all general and family physicians as a group and the general lack of description of the physicians involved. Some studies measuring the process of care indicate poorer process by family physicians or general practitioners, such as recording fewer medical process criteria used to measure quality of care. The quality of care by outcome measures, however, appears to be similar to that of other specialties. In general, the study of quality of care is in its infancy, and further work needs to be done to assess what training is needed to produce the highest quality primary care physicians.\r"

However, there is a close association reported of this form of trigeminal neuropathy with reactivation of orofacial herpes simplex that suggests the possibility that the chemical, which readily gains entrance into the nervous system, may be responsible for reactivating the latent virus. This novel hypothesis is discussed in the light of current understanding of latency in herpes simplex infection in nervous tissue.\r"

Since these findings show some parallelism with the amount of cortical damage and given the scarce gliosis and spongiosis found in only six of the 20 CJD brains, we postulate that the involvement of the nbM in CJD is a retrograde abnormality secondary to the damage of the neocortex.\r"

Sixty six patients have been randomised to bromocriptine and 63 patients to levodopa-carbidopa. Improvement has been greater in the levodopa-carbidopa group than in the bromocriptine group. Involuntary movements have so far only occurred in patients on levodopa-carbidopa, the incidence being much lower than is usually described with conventional doses. Mild, end-of-dose failure has occurred in both treatment groups; however, no patient has developed the \"on-off\" phenomenon. Low-dose levodopa-carbidopa appears to be a more effective anti-Parkinsonian treatment than low-dose bromocriptine but more prone to cause dyskinesia.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following three regimens: cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV day 1, and etoposide 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, followed by etoposide 100 mg/m2/day orally days 2 through 5 (CEV); cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg/m2 IV day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV day 1, and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CAV); cyclophosphamide 2,000 mg/m2 day 1 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CV). Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Treatment groups were comparable with respect to extent of disease, age, sex, performance status, and metastatic sites. No significant differences in response rates, response duration, or survival could be detected in limited disease, although there appeared to be a trend favoring CEV. Among extensive-disease patients, response duration on the CEV regimen was longer than on the CV regimen or the CAV program (P less than .001). The superiority of the CEV regimen was also demonstrated in the survival analysis in which differences attained statistical significance (P = .01). In this group the median survival was increased from 29 weeks on CV to 31 weeks on CAV and 39 weeks on CEV. Myelosuppression was the most frequent toxicity. It was more severe with CV than CEV or CAV. Most nonhematologic side effects were comparable among the three treatment groups. However, the high doses of cyclophosphamide in the CV regimen produced a higher incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis than in the CEV or CAV programs (P less than .001). Cardiotoxicity only occurred in the CAV group (P = .05). The addition of etoposide to the CV regimen resulted in significantly longer response duration and survival without increased toxicity. Similarly, the substitution of etoposide for the doxorubicin in the CAV regimen was associated with prolonged survival and reduced cardiotoxicity.\r"

Sites of disease included lung, liver, subcutaneous nodules, and intra-abdominal metastases. One complete response (CR) and five partial responses (PRs) resulted from treatment (19% response rate). The median response duration was 5 months, with the durable CR continuing at 31+ months and one durable PR continuing for 13 months. Sites of response included lung, liver, subcutaneous nodules, and lymph nodes. Response, response duration, or site of response did not correlate with the total dose of IL-2 administered, rebound lymphocytosis, or the number of LAK cells infused. Toxicity included hypotension, fluid retention with a \"capillary leak syndrome\" in most patients, and transient multiorgan dysfunction that resolved promptly after the completion of therapy. Adverse cardiac events occurred in 16% of patients, with one myocardial infarction leading to a death. This study confirms the activity of the initial IL-2/LAK cell regimen in metastatic melanoma reported by Rosenberg et al, supporting the concept of adoptive immunotherapy as an important new treatment approach for this disease.\r"

Thirty-six patients had metastatic melanoma, 35 had metastatic renal cell cancer, and 22 had colorectal cancer. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80% and normal laboratory tests and organ function, and had received no more than one prior form of immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Objective responders were eligible to receive up to two additional courses of therapy at 12-week intervals. The most frequent toxicities were a capillary leak syndrome resulting in marked extravascular fluid shifts, and hypotension requiring treatment with large volumes of IV fluids and vasopressor agents. Laboratory and clinical evidence of hepatic and renal dysfunction were virtually universal. Intensive care-level support was routinely provided and the toxicity observations confirmed the need for this level of care. The life-threatening toxicities were cardiac and pulmonary. Five of the 27 patients who experienced significant respiratory compromise required intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Twenty patients developed cardiac arrhythmias, the majority of which were supraventricular. There was a single episode of ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion. Four patients had transient cardiac ischemia, and an additional four had myocardial infarctions, one of which was fatal. With these exceptions, all toxicities were rapidly reversible. The occurrence of only a single therapy-related death and a very low incidence of other irreversible or life-threatening events is comparable to the level of toxicities often observed in other phase II trials. Although the intensity of this regimen limits this approach to a subset of cancer patients with excellent performance status and adequate organ function, because of the frequency and apparent durability of complete responses, this treatment warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous bone marrow transplantation (AuBMT) is in clinical trial for patients with metastatic solid tumors, particularly breast cancer. This review deals with the potential of this approach. AuBMT is curative for the leukemias and lymphomas. Curative cancer chemotherapy has, almost without exception, required combinations of agents wherein dose was well maintained. However, curative chemotherapy strategies for the hematologic neoplasms have not proven successful for the common solid tumors. An important exception is that standard adjuvant chemotherapy can \"cure\" some micrometastatic tumors. Preclinical studies indicate the effectiveness of alkylating agents in terms of maintained dose effect through multiple logs of tumor cell kill; difficulty in developing drug resistance; general lack of cross resistance; and synergy for alkylating agents used in combination. There is an increasingly effective experimental basis for the construct of intensification regimens employing combinations of alkylating agents. Differing nonmyelosuppressive toxicity for alkylating agents provides a basis for maintaining dose when employed in combination in the autologous marrow situation. The aforementioned studies and cytokinetic analyses of combined intensive alkylating agent therapy for breast cancer support the potential of this approach. Clinical trials indicate a high response rate in refractory breast cancer. Trials involving induction chemotherapy followed by combined alkylating agent intensification have produced substantial complete remission rates. The duration of response has, in most studies, been short. This approach is associated with major toxicity, including mortality, and is expensive. Experimental and preliminary clinical evidence as marshalled in this review indicate that this is a promising area for therapeutic research.\r"

Breast, colon, and lung cancer are used to exemplify clinical and research activity in familial cancer; clinical phenotypes, segregation and linkage analyses, models for environmental interactions with inherited traits, and molecular mechanisms of tumor development are discussed. We conclude that the contribution of heredity to the cancer burden is greater than generally accepted, and that study of heritable predisposition will continue to reveal carcinogenic mechanisms important to the development of all cancers.\r"

Resection by conventional craniotomy, whether via a transcallosal or transcortical approach, carries well-known risks and limitations. Alternatively, in this region traditional stereotaxy has been relegated to use with biopsy only or cyst aspiration procedures. Combining aspects of both conventional and stereotaxic techniques has allowed total removal of 12 colloid cysts in six women and six men ranging in age from 25 to 71 years. No mortality and minimal morbidity have been associated with the procedures. There has been no evidence of recurrence in an average follow-up period of 19 months. By coupling the benefits of stereotaxic precision and localization to the microsurgical management of colloid cysts, several rewards have been realized: 1) only a limited cortical dissection is needed; 2) the hazards of callosal or forniceal injury can be avoided; 3) the lesion is easily localized regardless of ventricular size; 4) hemostasis can be readily achieved with bipolar cautery or defocused laser power; and 5) most importantly, a total resection is possible with little risk to the patient. Stereotaxic microsurgical laser craniotomy provides a new option for the management of colloid cysts and other anterior third-ventricular lesions.\r"

  ".U": "89177510\r", 
  ".W": "A series of 29 previously untreated patients with acromegaly underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Pre- and postoperative evaluation consisted of measuring growth hormone (GH) secretory dynamics during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the insulin hypoglycemia test, and the thyrotropin- and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (TRH/GnRH) test, and by obtaining the basal somatomedin-C level. After surgery, clinical and biochemical amelioration was achieved in all but two patients. In the whole group, basal GH and somatomedin-C levels decreased from a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 52.3 +/- 12.7 to 11.1 +/- 6.3 ng/ml and from 7.6 +/- 0.7 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 U/ml, respectively. Application of different criteria of cure revealed that 19 patients (66%) had basal GH levels below 5 ng/ml, 17 patients (59%) had normal somatomedin-C values, 16 patients (55%) had complete GH suppression (less than 1 ng/ml) during OGTT, and 13 patients (45%) met the above-mentioned criteria with disappearance of the paradoxical GH response to TRH/GnRH test. Evaluation of GH secretion by insulin hypoglycemia testing was useless in assessing the outcome after neurosurgery. When only patients with a normal somatomedin-C level and complete GH suppressibility during OGTT were considered \"cured,\" the main favorable prognostic factor was intrasellar tumor localization, since 15 (75%) of 20 patients were \"cured,\" as opposed to only one (11%) of nine with extrasellar extension of the adenoma. During the follow-up period, no tumor recurrence was detected in any of the \"cured\" patients. In these subjects somatomedin-C levels remained stable in all except two patients, who showed a slow increase within the normal range of somatomedin-C concentration. These data confirm that transsphenoidal surgery is the most effective form of treatment in previously untreated acromegalic patients and that normalization of somatomedin-C levels reflects normal GH secretion. Measurement of somatomedin-C could replace more extensive endocrinological testing during monitoring of treated acromegalic patients.\r"

To examine this phenomenon, an inoculum of Escherichia coli was injected into the lateral ventricles of New Zealand White rabbits. Approximately 18 hours later, the survivors (64%) underwent a 3-hour ventriculocisternal perfusion of carbon-14-dextran (MW 7 X 10(4)) as a reference marker for CSF formation. On the average, CSF formation in this experimental group was reduced by one-half to two-thirds of normal, confirming the clinical observation. Histologically, the stroma of the choroid plexus was the site of an extensive inflammatory infiltrate. Meningitis, ependymitis, and focal encephalitis completed the picture. Vasculitis was not present in the choroid plexus. The epithelium of the choroid plexus underwent patchy cellular swelling or frank necrosis and destruction. It is postulated that the changes in the choroid plexus caused by the inflammatory process were responsible for the diminished CSF formation in this acute setting. Reduced choroidal blood flow and/or enterotoxin may play a role in these alterations.\r"

The study showed that the maxillary artery and the main bifurcation of the facial nerve are located a safe distance from the usual arthroscopic approaches to the TMJ. The frontal branch of the facial nerve are located a safe distance from the usual arthroscopic approaches to the TMJ. The frontal branch of the facial nerve may be as close as 3 mm anterior to the midpoint of the lateral pole of the condyle. The neurovascular complex of the superficial temporal vessels and the auriculotemporal nerve may also be very close to puncture sites. The roof of the glenoid fossa had an average thickness of 0.9 mm. The external soft tissue auditory canal courses anteriorly to meet the bony external auditory canal. A skin puncture perpendicular to the bony canal was approximately 7 mm anterior to the posterior aspect of the tragus.\r"

Procedures for diagnosing and treating this disorder (both initially and over the long term) have been compiled by a working party on homozygous protein C deficiency of the Subcommittee on Protein C of the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Homozygous protein C deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that usually manifests itself by purpura fulminans and, less commonly, by massive large vein thrombosis; severe diffuse intravascular coagulation also develops in these infants, and there is evidence of intrauterine thrombosis. For confirmation of homozygous protein C deficiency in a neonate with purpura fulminans or massive venous thrombosis, the infant should have undetectable protein C activity and both parents should be heterozygous for protein C deficiency. At the onset of symptoms, the initial treatment should be plasma (8 to 12 ml/kg every 12 hours) until all lesions have healed. Two modalities for long-term treatment are accepted as useful in these children: oral anticoagulant therapy or protein C replacement (fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate). Liver transplantation has been performed in only one child, with success. Oral anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonists, maintaining the prothrombin time from one and one-half to two times control values or at the International Normalized Ratio of 2.5 to 4.4) is our recommendation of choice for long-term treatment. With appropriate care, these children are able to be free of coagulopathy and live relatively normal lives.\r"

The cell-free virus was detected in blood in 10 (21%) of 47 blood samples during the same period. The antibody activity to the virus, evaluated by a newly developed neutralization assay, was first detected on day 3 of the disease with a positive rate of 18% (2/11). It became 60% (6/10) on day 4, 75% (9/12) on days 5 to 7, and 100% on day 8 and thereafter.

The nonstreak ovaries ranged from small glands, sometimes containing minute cysts, to ovaries indistinguishable from those which are normal for age. Nonstreak ovaries retained a range of function, as evidenced in some cases by spontaneous breast development and uterine enlargement. The proportion of nonstreak ovaries followed a U-shaped pattern, with a nadir from 4 to 10 years; this follows the known biphasic pattern of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion. Only those patients with karyotype variants in which the long arm of the X chromosome was retained fared better than those with the 45,X karyotype.\r"

The development of children with onset of liver disease in the first year of life was more likely to remain delayed after transplantation. Older subjects improved significantly in social competence (p less than 0.008). There were significant increments after transplantation in weight, head circumference, and arm anthropometrics (p less than 0.0001 to 0.04), but there was no change in linear growth rate. Increments in length correlated negatively with steroid dosage, and change in head circumference was associated with age at time of transplantation (p less than 0.005 to 0.10).\r"

Its selective antidiuretic activity is used with advantage in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis and as a diagnostic test of tubular function. Desmopressin is available for intranasal and parenteral administration; antidiuretic doses range from 10 to 40 micrograms intranasally and from 2 to 4 micrograms intravenously or subcutaneously. For its hemostatic effect, a single infusion of desmopressin at a dose of 0.3 microgram/kg has been used in most studies. Well-documented evidence shows that desmopressin is safe and efficacious as a selective antidiuretic agent for the treatment of central diabetes insipidus and nocturnal enuresis and as a diagnostic test of tubular function. Even at the 15-fold higher doses used in bleeding disorders, desmopressin appears to be well tolerated.\r"

The development of the transvaginal ultrasound probe, with its better resolution, has enabled the clinician to routinely recover oocytes for in vitro fertilization without the risk of general anesthesia in a surgical procedure and has also enhanced the clinician's ability to diagnose early ectopic pregnancy.\r"

The values ranged from highs of 1.57-1.62 for the pre-1979 Ford LTD, the pre-1979 Chevrolet Nova, and the pre-1982 Pontiac Firebird to lows of 1.01-1.07 for the Jeep CJ-5 and CJ-7 and the pre-1978 Ford Bronco. Rollover as the first harmful event and as the most harmful event per 100,000 vehicles registered was strongly predicted by stability. Stability was unrelated to nonrollover crashes. The low-stability vehicles were much more likely to roll over on the road rather than after leaving the road. Other road, driver, and environmental risk factors recorded in the FARS files were not correlated to stability in such a way as to explain the high rollover of low-stability vehicles. Using Federal Highway Administration vehicle mileage estimates, calculations were made of the mileages under various conditions which the vehicles with low stability values would have to have been driven if mileage or hazardous-condition differences rather than stability differences accounted for their substantially higher fatal rollover fatal crash rates. This analysis indicates that fatal rollover rates of low-stability vehicles could not have occurred at reasonable mileage.\r"

Under anesthesia initially with intravenous sodium pentobarbital 35 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg/hr, a third-degree burn of about 50% of the total body surface was created by acetylene torch over the ventral wall of the chest and abdomen. Cardiovascular parameters including heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, cardiac index, and cardiac contractility (dP/dt of left ventricular pressure), as well as blood chemical data of pH value and K+ concentration were monitored. The present GIK therapy in EABI dogs effectively prevented a decrease in cardiac function, markedly enhanced cardiac function, steadily prolonged cardiac enhancement, and safely avoided hypoglycemic attack.\r"

The most frequent etiology was assault with a blunt object or fist (70.1%) followed by motor vehicle accidents (13.5%), falls (9.3%), and gunshot wounds (6.1%). Initial diagnostic procedures included a facial X-ray series in 99.9%, tomograms in 43.1%, and CT studies in 8.1%. Surgical intervention was required in 61.2% of cases. Prosthetic materials were used in 8.5% of the cases. At our institution, personal assault was found to be the primary cause of both midface fractures and mandibular fractures.\r"

Spermatogenic cells of the same progeny, connected by intercellular bridges, display synchronous DNA synthesis when labeled at the preleptotene stage of meiotic prophase. The pattern of [35S]methionine-labeled secretory proteins was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography during testicular development and compared with these observed in human Sertoli-spermatogenic cell cocultures prepared from same specimens. Both testicular tissue and cocultured Sertoli and spermatogenic cells displayed comparable patterns of secretory proteins. A discrete group of acidic polypeptides of Sertoli cell origin enhanced their radiolabeling intensity during testicular development. Results of this paper indicate that human Sertoli-spermatogenic cell cocultures could be valuable for assessing the proliferation and differentiation potential of spermatogenic cells in children with cryptorchid testis.\r"

Increasing concentrations of formalin slightly improved effectiveness of therapy and reduced the rate of recurrence of hematuria. However, this often resulted in an increase in morbidity. When patients were categorized according to the etiology of intractable hematuria it was noted that lower concentrations of formalin were effective in controlling hematuria caused by either cyclophosphamide cystitis or unresectable carcinoma of the bladder. In contrast, higher formalin concentrations were required to control bleeding due to radiation cystitis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether serum gamma-enolase is a useful marker for renal cell carcinoma alpha and gamma-enolases in tissues of 36 renal cell carcinomas and 13 normal kidneys, and in sera of 103 renal cell carcinoma patients were determined with an enzyme immunoassay system. Tissue gamma and alpha-enolase levels were 34 and 2.3 times higher, respectively, in renal cell carcinoma than in normal renal cortex. The tissue gamma enolase-to-total enolase value of renal cell carcinoma (5.3 per cent) was significantly higher than that of normal cortex (0.29 per cent) and medulla (0.51 per cent). Over-all serum gamma-enolase levels were elevated (more than 6.0 ng. per ml.) in 53 of 103 patients (51 per cent) with renal cell carcinoma. In regard to stage the positive rates were 34 per cent (12 of 35) of patients with stage I, 22 per cent (2 of 9) with stage II, 80 per cent (12 of 15) with stage III, 61 per cent (22 of 36) with stage IV and 61 per cent (5 of 8) with recurrent disease. The mean value of serum gamma-enolase in renal cell carcinoma (8.0 +/- 5.7 ng. per ml.) was significantly higher than that of normal subjects (3.1 +/- 0.9 ng. per ml., p less than 0.001). The mean value of serum gamma-enolase in patients with high stage tumors (III and IV, 9.9 +/- 6.8 ng. per nl.) was significantly higher than that of low stage tumors (I and II, 5.8 +/- 3.0 ng. per ml., p less than 0.001). In 39 patients treated by complete surgical excision serum gamma-enolase was significantly reduced postoperatively (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, 7 of 8 patients whose serum gamma-enolase levels were determined serially had levels within the normal range postoperatively that increased when distant metastases appeared. These results indicate that serum gamma-enolase could be a useful tumor marker to stage disease and monitor treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Only previously untreated patients with advanced (stage T3/T4/M0 or M1) prostatic cancer were eligible. After identification of prognostic factors by means of univariate analyses a multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards regression model was done. This test identified performance status (according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale) as the most important factor, followed by acid phosphatase (more than 2 times normal) for stage M0 cancer patients, and alkaline phosphatase, T category and the presence or absence of associated chronic disease for stage M1 cancer patients. Based on these 4 variables nonbedridden patients with metastatic disease can be divided into 2 groups: poor and good risk patients, with median survivals of 1 and 3 years, respectively. This study shows that routine clinical and laboratory data already provide an excellent indication as to the prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the relationship of serum prostate-specific antigen to prostatic size and hormonal stimulation. Seven patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated for six months with nafarelin acetate and then followed for an additional six months. Nafarelin acetate is a potent luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone agonist which causes reversible testosterone deprivation resulting in involution of the prostate. During therapy and follow up, serum prostate-specific antigen correlated with: 1) serum testosterone (p less than 0.001); 2) quantity of prostatic epithelium (p less than 0.001); and 3) prostatic size (p less than 0.05). Before therapy, serum prostate-specific antigen (mean +/- SD) was 0.43 +/- 0.2 ng./ml. per gram of epithelium. This did not change significantly after six months of androgen deprivation (0.48 +/- 0.36), although the ratios of prostate-specific antigen to testosterone and to prostatic size each changed significantly. Despite testosterone levels in the castrate range at six months, five of seven patients had serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations above the female range and three of seven patients had prostatic biopsies containing columnar epithelium which stained positively for prostate-specific antigen. These results demonstrate that serum prostate-specific antigen is related to prostatic size, prostatic epithelial weight, and testosterone stimulation. However, prostatic size is not a good predictor of serum prostate-specific antigen because there is tremendous variation in the relative amount of epithelium in a prostate; in this study the ratio of prostatic size to epithelial weight varied threefold. Furthermore, although testosterone determines prostatic size and amount of prostatic epithelium, it may not totally control prostate-specific antigen production.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has grown exponentially since its introduction. Currently, selection criteria include single-vessel and multivessel disease, stable and unstable angina, and acute infarction. The outcome depends on specific patient and angiographic characteristics. In ideal lesions, success rates should be greater than 90%, with low morbidity and mortality. With more severe and diffuse multivessel disease, success rates are lower and complication rates are higher. In these cases, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty still offers a reasonable option, provided complete revascularization can be achieved or the angina-producing lesion dilated. Numerous issues remain unresolved, including (1) the role of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty vs coronary surgery (currently being tested), (2) restenosis, which occurs in approximately 30% of treated lesions, and (3) organizational adjustments such as training and certification to maintain high standards of care.\r"

These trends, drawn from studies using comparable methods and modern diagnostic criteria, are evident in the United States, Sweden, Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, but not in comparable studies conducted in Korea and Puerto Rico and of Mexican-Americans living in the United States. These cohort changes cannot be fully attributed to artifacts of reporting, recall, mortality, or labeling and have implications for understanding the etiology of depression and for clinical practice.\r"

Guidelines for accurate nutritional assessment, which is essential to the decision to initiate nutritional therapy in this difficult to assess population, are also included. Current methods devised for treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and related disorders are presented. Emphasis is placed on recent developments in nutritional support techniques which make it possible to meet the energy requirements of all such patients.

  ".W": "The research evaluating the effects of programs and policies in reducing the incidence of alcohol problems is critically reviewed. Four types of preventive interventions are examined including: (1) policies affecting the physical, economic and social availability of alcohol (e.g., minimum legal drinking age, price and advertising of alcohol), (2) formal social controls on alcohol-related behavior (e.g., drinking-driving laws), (3) primary prevention programs (e.g., school-based alcohol education), and (4) environmental safety measures (e.g., automobile airbags). The research generally supports the efficacy of three alcohol-specific policies: raising the minimum legal drinking age to 21, increasing alcohol taxes and increasing the enforcement of drinking-driving laws. Also, research suggests that various environmental safety measures reduce the incidence of alcohol-related trauma. In contrast, little evidence currently exists to support the efficacy of primary prevention programs. However, a systems perspective of prevention suggests that prevention programs may become more efficacious after widespread adoption of prevention policies that lead to shifts in social norms regarding use of beverage alcohol.\r"

This will potentially lead to a greater degree of organ sparing. Studies of palliation, and aspects of quality of life, are also needed. Public education about the condition and genital hygiene, including the necessity for the early treatment of phimosis, may further reduce the incidence of penis cancer.\r"

Ashkenazi Jews had a higher rate of nodular lymphoma compared to non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs. Extranodal lymphoma occurred more frequently in non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs. Lymphoma of the small intestine was more common in Arabs than in Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews.

All patients had a stenosis of 70% or greater in either the mid or proximal segment of all three coronary arteries. There were 679 medically treated patients and 1921 surgically treated patients in this nonrandomized comparison. Patients were stratified by left ventricular wall motion score and number of proximal coronary artery stenoses; after adjustment for these variables, the estimated probability of being alive at 6 years was 82% for surgically treated patients and 59% for medically treated patients (p less than 0.0001). Among patients with the most severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular wall motion score of 16 to 30), the 6-year survival rate was 63% for surgically treated patients and 30% for medically treated patients (p less than 0.0001). Those with three proximal lesions (all gradations of left ventricular score) had an 81% 6-year survival rate with surgical treatment and 40% with medical treatment (p less than 0.0001). Ninety percent of surgically treated patients with normal ventricular function were living at 6 years and 78% of medically treated patients (p less than 0.0001). Among these patients, the survival rate was significantly better after surgical treatment than after only medical treatment if two or three proximal stenoses were present. If no proximal lesions were present (all categories of left ventricular function), 84% of surgically treated patients and 67% of medically treated patients were alive at 6 years (p less than 0.0001). In a multivariate (Cox) analysis of preoperative clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic factors, early operation was a strong predictor of survival (estimated relative risk 0.38).\r"

In this study, we composed a new solution (UCLA formula) containing both of these factors and compared it with Collins-Sachs solution in a canine autotransplantation model. A total of 15 dogs were used. The animals were assigned randomly to the two study groups. The left lungs of seven dogs were perfused with the UCLA formula and the left lungs of eight dogs with Collins-Sachs. Both solutions were at 4 degrees C. After 6 hours of preservation, the left lungs in both groups were autotransplanted. In the UCLA formula group, seven of seven dogs (100%) survived for the entire period of 2 weeks after the operation. In contrast, two of eight dogs in the Collins-Sachs group (25%) survived for longer than 24 hours. Pulmonary artery resistance (dyne.sec.cm-5) after transplantation was 499.8 +/- 144.8 in the UCLA group and 780.9 +/- 174.5 in the Collins-Sachs group (p less than 0.01). Pulmonary artery resistance was also ascertained with the right pulmonary artery occlusion test and showed 539.5 +/- 95.4 in the UCLA group and 1469.3 +/- 573.6 in the Collins-Sachs group (p less than 0.01). Oxygen tension (mm Hg) after lung transplantation was 74.1 +/- 10.6 in the UCLA group and 35.9 +/- 3.5 in the Collins-Sachs group (p less than 0.01). Postoperative oxygen tension with the right pulmonary artery occlusion test was measured daily for 7 days. Two survivors in the Collins-Sachs group showed significant deterioration of oxygen tension from the third postoperative day. Also, the relationship between the airway pressure and tidal volume showed a significant reduction in the Collins-Sachs group (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, the transplanted lung in which UCLA solution was used demonstrated improved lung function after 6 hours of preservation in comparison with function in lungs preserved with Collins-Sachs solution.\r"

  ".U": "89180190\r", 
  ".W": "Single lung transplantation now is a therapeutic option for some patients with end-stage lung disease. Cyclosporine immunosuppression and refinements in bronchial anastomosis have been responsible for recent successes. Since 1953, the usual pulmonary venous anastomosis, both in experimental animals and in humans, has been an atrium-to-atrium connection. This technique may limit the availability of usable donor lungs, since the donor heart, along with the atrium, is usually harvested for another recipient. Although techniques can be developed to allow both transplant teams to harvest atrial tissue, this study was undertaken to determine if, in fact, anastomosis with donor left atrium is necessary. Twenty-four dogs were anesthetized and a left thoracotomy performed. After heparinization (3 mg/kg), the pulmonary artery and left atrium were occluded. One of four different pulmonary venous anastomoses was performed at 3.5x magnification: superior pulmonary vein end to end (group I), inferior pulmonary vein end to end (group II), superior pulmonary vein implantation into left atrium (group III), and left atrium-to-left atrium anastomosis as control (group IV). Everting mattress sutures of 7-0 polypropylene were used in groups I, II, and III and 6-0 in group IV. Average crossclamp time for group I, group II, and group IV was 20 minutes. The average crossclamp time for group III was 10 minutes. All anastomoses were patent at the time of 1-week reevaluation. Gross and microscopic examination demonstrated establishment of an intimal lining; organized nonocclusive thrombus was present in only one anastomosis. We conclude that atrium-to-atrium anastomosis is not necessary for a successful single lung transplantation, and that transplantation of a single lobe is feasible. The best alternative is implantation of the pulmonary vein into the left atrium, which will easily allow use of the heart and both lungs from a single donor to different recipients. We have used this anastomosis in one patient without difficulty.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchiolitis obliterans (irreversible small airway obstruction) is a late complication of heart-lung transplantation. Chronic immune rejection is believed to be the major cause of this complication. Our hypothesis was that denervation might contribute to airway obstruction. To test this hypothesis in the absence of immune rejection, we performed a lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung and autologous reimplantation of the lower lobe of the left lung in 13 growing pigs. To serve as age-matched controls, six other pigs had sham left thoracotomy and nine others had a lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung alone. Nine to 10 weeks after operation, the animals were anesthetized and the lungs mechanically ventilated. The lobes were then isolated in vivo to measure differential transrespiratory mechanics and volumes. Dynamic compliance was significantly lower in the reimplanted lobe than it was in the contralateral right lung. This was the case after lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung or sham thoracotomy. Dynamic resistance was significantly higher in the reimplanted lobe than it was in the contralateral right lung and in the left lung after sham thoracotomy. Measurements of extravascular lung water, dry lobe weight, alveolar cross-sectional area, and volumetric proportions of lung parenchyma and alveolar spaces did not demonstrate abnormal structural growth after reimplantation. We conclude that lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung and autologous reimplantation of the left lower lobe leads to adverse changes in flow-dependent measurements of airway patency. Changes in bronchomotor regulation imposed by denervation may contribute to airway obstruction after heart-lung transplantation.\r"

Other liver function tests (bilirubin, prothrombin time, activity of aminotransferases, glutamate dehydrogenase, and cholinesterase, indocyanine green clearance, and galactose elimination capacity) were inefficient at predicting early outcome of transplantation. For a 20-day graft survival, the MEGX test showed prognostic sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 78%.

  ".W": "To induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), five consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease in resistant relapse were treated with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation or busulphan and cyclophosphamide, followed by autologous BMT. The patients received cyclosporin 1 mg/kg per day intravenously for 28 days after BMT. Histologically proven grade II acute GvHD of the skin developed in all the patients at a median of 11 days (range 9-13) after BMT. One patient died and the GvHD resolved in 1-3 weeks in the four remaining patients--spontaneously in two and with corticosteroid treatment in two. Lymphocytes from one patient obtained at the time of GvHD were cytotoxic for the patient's own pretransplant lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity was blocked by antibodies directed against class II histocompatibility (HLA-DR or Ia) antigens. Cyclosporin-induced GvHD after autologous BMT resembles mild GvHD after allogeneic grafting. This syndrome appears to be mediated by autoreactive Ia-specific lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Although the major initial application for endoscopic laser therapy was for the management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, it is now more common to use the laser endoscopically for the treatment of gastrointestinal neoplasms. A major body of literature surrounds the use of endoscopic laser therapy for esophageal cancer. The initial patient evaluation to determine if laser therapy is indicated includes a contrast radiograph, a screening endoscopy, and an imaging study. After these tests have been performed, it can be determined whether endoscopic laser therapy (ELT) is the best of the many endoscopic options. There is some difference of opinion as to the specifics of the treatment technique, and these are described. There is general agreement from reviewing the clinical data that it is possible to open the obstructed lumen in a large majority of cases and that functional success (the ability to achieve technically good results as well as clinical improvement without complications) is also possible in the majority of patients. Despite the information suggesting the benefits of ELT for esophageal cancer, there are both conceptual and technical limitations to the current approach to therapy. These limitations as well as potential future applications are discussed.\r"

Irradiation of bacteria having respiratory chain components as primary photoacceptors accelerated their division in a dose-dependent manner, but irradiation had no effect on the properties of the phage (measured as its ability to infect host cells). At the same time, exposure of bacteria to stimulating doses of He-Ne laser radiation (from 10(3) to 6 x 10(4) J/m2) increased their ability to promote the growth of unexposed phages. These results clearly indicate that low-power laser effects require primary photoacceptors (phage contains no chromophores for red light).\r"

An objective examination like telethermography was performed with the clinical evaluations (pain on movement or at pressure, motility, and swelling) before and after the treatment period, in all patients. Moreover, at the end of the trial both investigator and patient gave their global judgement of efficacy. The statistical analysis showed a significant superiority of diclofenac sodium versus suprofen and placebo both in patients' and in investigators' global evaluations (P less than 0.05--Kruskal-Wallis tests). This superiority appeared particularly clear in the telethermographic evaluation (P less than 0.05), which is more objective than the clinical one, attesting to the usefulness of the early administration of anti-inflammatory drugs in management of sports injuries. Furthermore, a correlation analysis showed that telethermography is a good technique in controlling the recovery process.\r"

Muscle creatine kinase (CKM) and adenylate kinase (myokinase) (AK1M) were studied for the presence of variants. Six individuals exhibited a CKM variant described here for the first time, for a frequency of the variant gene of 1%. For AK1M, 21 individuals were heterozygotes for an inherited variant protein, an allele frequency of 3.5%. CKM (N = 5) and AK1M (N = 18) variant individuals were paired with control subjects who had the common CKM or AK1M muscle phenotype and compared for several performance indicators. There was no significant difference between the CKM and AK1M common and variant phenotypes for any of the performance measurements. However, the CKM variant subjects tended to be more effective than controls in a 90-min performance test (by about 22%) and had less percent decline over 60 s in force generation (by about 26%). In a subsequent experiment, a few variant subjects could be compared to controls in terms of response to exercise training. Although trends were observed, the CKM and AK1M variant subjects had a response to training generally comparable to that of the nonvariant individuals. While human variation in performance and trainability cannot be accounted for by the genetic polymorphism of the two kinase enzymes, the trends in the data suggest that allelic variation at these two gene loci may be of some functional significance.\r"

  ".U": "89181829\r", 
  ".W": "The occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia is thought to decrease the probability of recurrence. To study this effect (called adoptive immunotherapy) we modified the prophylaxis of GVHD in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms (mostly leukemia) who received bone marrow transplants. Patients under 30 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three regimens of post-transplantation immunosuppression: Group I (n = 44) received a standard course of methotrexate for 102 days after transplantation, Group II (n = 40) received an abbreviated (11-day) course of methotrexate, and Group III (n = 25) received the standard course of methotrexate plus viable buffy-coat cells from the marrow donors. All 109 patients received cyclophosphamide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight on each of two days), total-body irradiation (2.25 Gy daily for seven days), and unmodified marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors. The frequency of GVHD of Grades II through IV was 25 percent in Group I, 59 percent in Group II, and 82 percent in Group III (P = 0.0001). The incidence of chronic GVHD, however, did not differ significantly among the groups (33, 51, and 44 percent, respectively), nor did the five-year probability of recurrence of disease (38, 45, and 33 percent, respectively). However, mortality from causes other than cancer was 34 percent in Group I, 45 percent in Group II, and 64 percent in Group III (I vs. III, P = 0.024); the deaths were due primarily to infections complicating the course of GVHD. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 3.9 to 7.4), disease-free survival was 41 percent in Group I, 30 percent in Group II, and 24 percent in Group III (the differences were not statistically significant). We conclude that abbreviating methotrexate prophylaxis or infusing donor buffy-coat cells increased the incidence of acute GVHD and related mortality without altering the incidence of chronic GVHD or the recurrence of malignant disease.\r"

Surgery was performed with no change in the level of anticoagulant therapy, and treatment with the anticoagulant agent was continued after surgery. Before it was sutured, the operative field was irrigated in 19 patients with 10 ml of a 4.8 percent aqueous solution of tranexamic acid (an inhibitor of fibrinolysis) and in 20 patients with a placebo solution. For seven days thereafter, patients were instructed to rinse their mouths with 10 ml of the assigned solution for two minutes four times a day. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in base-line variables, including the level of anticoagulation at the time of surgery. Eight patients in the placebo group had a total of 10 postoperative bleeding episodes, whereas only 1 patient in the tranexamic acid group had a bleeding episode (P = 0.01). There were no systemic side effects. We conclude that local antifibrinolytic therapy is effective in preventing bleeding after oral surgery in patients who are being treated with anticoagulants.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence rate of insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus is bimodal: one peak occurs close to puberty, and the other in the fifth decade. To evaluate possible differences in these forms of the disease, we examined the clinical, biochemical, autoimmune, and genetic features of 82 children and adolescents (1.3 to 18.2 years old) and 44 adults (20.0 to 55.8 years old) when they presented with Type I diabetes. The mean (+/- SEM) duration of symptoms before diagnosis was longer in the adults (7.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.4 weeks; P less than 0.001), and their serum C-peptide concentrations at diagnosis were higher (0.29 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.01 nmol per liter; P less than 0.001), suggesting that they had more residual beta-cell function. There were no significant differences between the two groups in sex ratio, blood glucose levels, hemoglobin A1 values, degree of metabolic decompensation, or frequency of Type I diabetes in first-degree relatives. Thirty-four of 80 children tested (42.5 percent) were positive for insulin autoantibodies, as compared with only 1 of 26 adults (3.8 percent; P less than 0.001). However, the frequencies of islet-cell autoantibodies were similar in the adults and children (conventional autoantibodies, both 81 percent; complement-fixing autoantibodies, 46.2 percent and 60 percent). More children than adults were heterozygous for both HLA-Dw3/4 antigens (26.6 percent vs. 9.8 percent; P less than 0.05) and HLA-DR3/4 antigens (36.6 percent vs. 12.5 percent; P less than 0.05). We conclude that Type I diabetes that begins in adulthood is characterized by a longer symptomatic period before diagnosis, better preservation of residual beta-cell function, and lower frequencies of insulin autoantibodies and HLA-D3/D4 heterozygosity than Type I diabetes that begins in childhood or adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "Life-threatening reactions to intravenous protamine, administered to reverse heparin anticoagulation, have been reported with increasing frequency as a consequence of the escalating use of cardiac catheterization and coronary bypass surgery. Retrospective studies have shown that such reactions are more common in diabetic patients receiving daily subcutaneous injections of protamine-insulin preparations. To determine whether anti-protamine IgE or IgG antibodies might explain the increased risk for protamine reactions among patients with protamine-insulin-dependent diabetes, we conducted a case-control study of 27 patients (diabetic and nondiabetic) who had acute reactions to intravenous protamine and 43 diabetic patients who tolerated protamine without a reaction during diagnostic or surgical procedures. Cases and controls were grouped according to previous exposure to protamine-insulin preparations. In diabetic patients who had received protamine-insulin injections, the presence of serum antiprotamine IgE antibody was a significant risk factor for acute protamine reactions (relative risk, 95; P = 1.0 X 10(-5), as was antiprotamine IgG (relative risk, 38; P = 1.2 X 10(-5). No patients without previous exposure to protamine-insulin injections had serum protamine IgE antibodies. In this group, anti-protamine IgG antibody was a risk factor for protamine reactions (relative risk, 25; P = 0.0062). We conclude that in protamine-insulin-dependent diabetics, the increased risk of serious reactions when intravenous protamine was given appeared to be caused largely by antibody-mediated mechanisms. In nondiabetic subjects, the presence of protamine IgG was significantly associated with an increased risk of acute protamine reactions, although many nondiabetic subjects who had reactions had no IgG antibodies.\r"

  ".U": "89181880\r", 
  ".W": "We carried out a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surfactant in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. The study population was made up of newborn infants weighing 750 to 1750 g who were receiving assisted ventilation with 40 percent or more oxygen. The eligible infants received a single dose of either surfactant (100 mg of phospholipid per kilogram of body weight [4 ml per kilogram]) or an air placebo (4 ml per kilogram), administered into the trachea within eight hours of birth by an investigator not involved in the clinical care of the infant. When compared with the infants who received the placebo (n = 81), the infants who were treated with surfactant (n = 78) had a 0.12 greater average increase in the ratio of arterial to alveolar oxygen tension (P less than 0.0001), a 0.20 greater average decrease in the fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P less than 0.0001), and a 0.26-kPa greater average decrease in the mean airway pressure (P less than 0.0001) during the 72 hours after treatment. Pneumothorax was less frequent among the infants treated with surfactant than in the control group (13 percent vs. 37 percent; P = 0.0005). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the proportion of infants in each of five ordered clinical-status categories on day 7 (P = 0.08) or day 28 (P = 0.75) after treatment. There were also no significant differences between the groups in the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, or periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. In each group, 17 percent of the infants died by day 28. We conclude that treatment with the single-dose surfactant regimen used in this study reduces the severity of respiratory distress during the 72 hours after treatment and decreases the frequency of pneumothorax, but that it does not significantly improve clinical status later in the neonatal period and does not reduce neonatal mortality. Further study of different surfactant regimens and patient-selection criteria will be required to determine whether this initial improvement can be translated into reductions in mortality or serious morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fats have been suggested to lower blood pressure, an effect ascribed to altered biosynthesis of eicosanoids. To test these hypotheses, we studied blood pressure and eicosanoid production during supplementation of dietary fat for four weeks in 32 men with mild essential hypertension. Supplementation was preceded and followed by four-week run-in and recovery periods. Groups of eight subjects received either 10 ml or 50 ml of fish oil (3 or 15 g of n-3 fatty acids) daily, 50 ml of safflower oil (39 g of n-6 fatty acids), or 50 ml of a mixture of oils that approximated the types of fat present in the American diet. The biosynthesis of eicosanoids was assessed by the measurement of urinary metabolites. Blood pressure decreased in the men who received the high dose of fish oil (systolic pressure by a mean of 6.5 mm Hg [P less than 0.03] and diastolic pressure by 4.4 mm Hg [P less than 0.015]), but not in the other groups. Although the formation of vasodilatory prostacyclins (prostaglandins I2 and I3) increased initially, this increase was not maintained as blood pressure fell. The level of thromboxane A2 metabolites fell; metabolites of thromboxane A3 were detected in the groups receiving fish oil. The formation of prostaglandin E2 increased during supplementation with safflower oil and tended to decrease with fish oil; no prostaglandin E3 metabolite was detected. Our data indicate that high doses of fish oil can reduce blood pressure in men with essential hypertension. However, the clinical usefulness and safety of fish oil in the treatment of hypertension will require further study.\r"

It has been unclear, however, why the other half do not respond. We evaluated 54 previously untreated patients with diffuse lymphoma and 20 with follicular lymphoma, all of whom had a large-cell component and Stage II through IV disease, subsequently treated with combined chemotherapy. Different recurrent genomic defects were associated with differences in the response to treatment. Among the 54 patients with diffuse lymphoma, all 12 patients with a duplication of chromosome 3p had a complete clinical remission after a median follow-up of 39 months (11 patients survived). In contrast, all seven patients with a duplication of chromosome 2p had a partial response or no response to treatment and a median survival of six months (all died). Among the 20 patients with follicular lymphoma, all 5 patients with duplication 3p or +3 had a complete clinical remission (all survived), and 3 of 4 patients with duplication 2p or +2 had no response or a partial response to treatment and died. Twenty-three patients with B-cell non-immunoblastic lymphoma or follicular lymphoma who had a bcl-2 oncogene rearrangement had a poorer response to therapy (7 of 23 with complete remission) than the patients without bcl-2 rearrangement (21 of 26 with complete remission). We conclude that in large-cell or mixed-cell lymphoma, duplication of chromosome 3p is associated with a relatively good prognosis and duplication of chromosome 2p or bcl-2 oncogene rearrangement is associated with a relatively poor prognosis. Because such multiple recurrent genomic defects are also common in most other types of cancer, they may have general prognostic importance.\r"

  ".W": "One class of excitatory amino-acid receptors, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mediates transmission at a small, but important, group of synapses in the neocortex. These receptors are implicated in neuronal plasticity during development in young mammals and in memory acquisition in adults. Recently, responses of isolated membrane patches to NMDA were shown to be greatly enhanced by glycine. This, together with the demonstration that the strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site is distinct from, but linked to, the NMDA receptor has excited intense interest in glycine as a synaptic modulator. Before proposing a physiological function, however, it is important to determine whether glycine could enhance synaptic responses to NMDA receptor activation in intact, adult tissue. An earlier study failed to demonstrate enhancement of NMDA responses when glycine was applied and it was proposed that in intact tissue the high-affinity glycine site was already saturated by endogenous glycine. It remained possible that glycine concentrations can be maintained at low levels close to synaptic receptors. We have examined responses of neurons in slices of adult neocortex to focal applications of excitatory amino acids and glycine and report enhancement by glycine of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials.\r"

  ".W": "Responses to the excitatory amino acid N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) are markedly potentiated by nanomolar concentrations of glycine. This is due to the action of glycine at a novel strychnine-resistant binding site with an anatomical distribution identical to that for NMDA receptors, suggesting that the NMDA receptor channel complex contains at least two classes of amino-acid recognition site. Antagonists at the glycine-binding site associated with NMDA receptors act as potent non-competitive antagonists, but do not alter the mean open time or conductance, as estimated by fluctuation analysis. The mechanisms by which glycine acts on NMDA receptors are unknown, but single-channel recording experiments show an increase in opening frequency with no change in mean open time or conductance, suggesting that glycine could regulate transitions to states that are intermediate between binding of NMDA receptor agonists and ion-channel gating. It has been suggested that glycine acts as a co-agonist at the NMDA receptor, and that responses to NMDA cannot be obtained in the complete absence of glycine, but in these experiments the response to NMDA was measured at equilibrium, and it is unlikely that sufficient temporal resolution was achieved to detect rapid alterations in receptor gating. Using a fast perfusion system we find that glycine regulates desensitization at NMDA receptors; this has a major effect on the response to NMDA measured at equilibrium, as would occur with slower applications of agonist. Reduction of NMDA receptor desensitization by glycine provides an example of a novel mechanism for regulation of ion-channel activity.\r"

It has a relative molecular mass of 427,000 and is encoded by a large RNA transcript processed from more than 65 exons spread over two million base pairs of the human X chromosome. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to see whether any of these exons are used alternatively in the different tissues that express dystrophin. As reported for rat dystrophin, we find that the first exons of the human dystrophin transcript is different in brain and muscle, indicating that dystrophin expression could be differentially regulated in these tissues by usage of distinct promoters. The 3' end of the dystrophin transcript can be alternatively spliced to create numerous isoforms differing at their carboxyl domains; this is the only domain of dystrophin that does not share any similarity with the related cytoskeletal alpha-actinins. These alternative transcripts yield dystrophin molecules which may interact with different proteins of the tissues expressing dystrophin.\r"

By calibrating the trapping force against Stokes' drag and measuring the twist that is sustained by this force, we determined the torsional compliance of flagella in tethered Escherichia coli and a motile Streptococcus. Flagella behaved as linear torsion springs for roughly half a revolution, but became much more rigid when turned beyond this point in either direction.\r"

  ".W": "Cysticercosis caused by larval tapeworms is a major public health problem and a cause of substantial economic losses in the farm-animal industries. Taenia ovis in sheep is a particularly important example. Immunity to reinfection with the larvae has a central role in regulating natural transmission of the parasites, and vaccination with antigens from the early larval oncosphere stage can induce complete protection against infection. As it is impractical to obtain enough oncospheres for a commercial vaccine against these tapeworms, an alternative approach is to use recombinant DNA methods to generate a cheap and plentiful supply of antigens. We report here the expression in Escherichia coli of complementary DNA encoding T. ovis antigens as fusion proteins with the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase. Vaccination of sheep with these fusion proteins gave significant, although not complete, immunity against challenge infection with T. ovis eggs. Commercial development of a vaccine is being pursued.\r"

  ".W": "SINCE insulin was first shown by Scott to crystallize in the presence of zinc ions in 1934, a variety of Zn-containing insulin crystals have been grown. The structures of insulin in the related rhombohedral crystals of 2Zn-insulin and 4Zn-insulin have been solved and reveal that the molecule is a hexamer, organized as three dimers, each containing a 2-fold symmetry axis and held together by Zn ions. In 2Zn-insulin the hexamer is nearly symmetrical with the two axial Zn ions and the two molecules of the dimer related closely by a local 2-fold axis. But in 4Zn-insulin the two molecules in the dimer differ remarkably, creating an asymmetric 4Zn-hexamer in which one trimer is essentially equivalent to that in 2Zn-insulin and the other is different by virtue of an additional stretch of N-terminal helix between residues B1 and B8 (refs 6, 7). We report here the structure of a new symmetrical hexamer, in which all six molecules have the B1-B8 helix seen in 4Zn-insulin. Phenol molecules, found bonding specifically to each molecule, evidently stabilize this new helical conformation.\r"

  ".W": "Norepinephrine (NE) changes during hydrocephalus, and the effects of surgical decompression on these changes, were studied using a new model of neonatal hydrocephalus. Kittens 4 to 10 days old received intracisternal injections of a sterile solution of 25% kaolin. Control kittens were injected similarly with sterile injectable saline. Ultrasonography was used to follow the progression of ventriculomegaly and the initial effects of the shunts. A subgroup of hydrocephalic animals was shunted using a cerebrospinal fluid lumbar-peritoneal catheter. Hydrocephalic animals were killed at approximately 25 days of age (16-21 days after kaolin injection). Surgical decompression was performed at 12, 16, and 17 days after kaolin injection; these animals were killed 30 days after the shunts were inserted. Control animals were killed at 29 and 53 days of age, to correlate with the ages of the hydrocephalic and shunted animals, respectively. Cortical samples equivalent to Brodmann's areas 4, 22, and 17 were measured for NE using high-performance liquid chromatography. Hydrocephalus caused NE levels to decrease significantly in all cortical areas. These alterations followed a rostrocaudal gradient in severity, with mean reductions of 65.8, 83.9, and 95.8% in areas 4, 22, and 17, respectively. Partial recovery occurred in animals that received shunts 16 and 17 days after kaolin injection, such that NE reductions of 75.7, 56.2, and 81.6% were noted in areas 4, 22, and 17, respectively. Shunting at 12 days after kaolin injection produced complete recovery in areas 4 and 22, with only a 67.7% decrease in area 17. These results suggest that the projection fibers from the locus ceruleus are damaged by the direct effects of hydrocephalus. Axotomy or neuropraxia of these fibers could result in decreases in NE throughout the cerebral cortex. In addition, there appears to be a period of time during which surgical decompression will allow neuropraxic fibers to recover with partial restoration of NE levels. Earlier insertion of a shunt appears to allow for more recovery than later decompression.\r"

Current intracranial hyperthermia methods, however, are limited in their ability to control spatiotemporal thermal distribution. A stereotaxic magnetic movement system that may be capable of heating discrete regions of brain to a preselected temperature is described. With this system, a ferromagnetic object (referred to as a thermoceptor) is directed through the brain by an external drive magnet. Real time thermoceptor position is monitored with biplanar fluoroscopy and superimposed on a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan using a computer. Once in position, the thermoceptor can be inductively heated by externally generated radiofrequency signals. Experiments on the magnetic drive and imaging aspects of this system have been conducted in vitro and in vivo. Mechanical studies of cadaver dog brains revealed that a mean force of 0.07 +/- 0.03 N was required to move a 3-mm diameter sphere through brain at a speed of less than 1 cm/15 s. A cranial phantom with mechanical properties similar to brain was constructed of gelatin and Plexiglas. With the use of a \"neck loop\" design drive magnet with a maximum magnetic field strength of 0.10 T, a 3 x 3 mm cylindrical neodymium iron boron thermoceptor was smoothly directed through the phantom in two dimensions. Additional experiments were conducted with a larger drive magnet in five anesthetized dogs. Neodymium iron boron and samarium cobalt thermoceptors of various shapes and sizes were placed into the cerebral cortex through a burr hole, then directed with the drive magnet. Fluoroscopy was used to follow the thermoceptor movements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 49 individuals clinically diagnosed as having classic DMD, female DMD, mild DMD \"outliers,\" and BMD. The patients' DNA was analyzed and alterations detected were correlated with particular phenotypes. We found that 14 of 32 classic DMD patients have an internal deletion in the same, relatively small, region of the gene; therefore this region may undergo deletions at a higher rate than the remainder of the gene. We could detect no alterations in the DNA in the remaining 18 patients. Selected patients from both groups failed to show muscle dystrophin. Seven of 11 patients with a mild DMD or BMD phenotype showed deletions at the 5' end of the gene. The other 4 patients failed to show deletions. Three of the patients with both a mild phenotype and a deletion at the 5' end had normal or low amounts of a dystrophin of smaller molecular weight. Patients with classic DMD who had a detectable deletion had a milder clinical course than those without. Contrary to a previous report, no patient in the population of clinically precisely defined DMD boys showed a deletion at the 5' end; thus, the outlier and BMD patients may be genetically different from boys with classic DMD. This correlation may be of diagnostic and prognostic significance.\r"

Seventy-seven patients (17.5%) had cervical adenocarcinoma and are reviewed in this retrospective study. Serial serum samples of these 77 patients were analyzed for cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Before treatment, only elevated serum CA 125 levels varied directly with the clinical stage of disease. In stages IB and II disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]), the incidence of elevated serum CA 125 levels was highest in patients with adenosquamous tumor. Serum marker levels, measured 3 months after therapy, concurred with the treatment results. At that time, 17 of the 23 cases (74%) with at least one elevated serum marker level either had residual disease (N = 9) or developed recurrent disease during follow-up (N = 8), compared with six of the 40 cases (15%) with normal serum marker levels (P less than .001). Increasing serum marker levels during follow-up coincided with or preceded the clinical detection of recurrent disease. Tumor relapse, clinically located in the vaginal vault, occurred concomitant with a rise of at least one serum marker level in six of the seven cases (86%). All 15 patients with abdominal recurrence showed elevation of CA 125. In progressive disease, very high serum CA 125, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were determined in patients with adenosquamous tumor, whereas patients with adenocarcinoma demonstrated only high CA 125 levels. We conclude that all three markers are important for monitoring patients with cervical adenocarcinoma.\r"

Five hundred asymptomatic patients with intact membranes who were in labor at term underwent sterile speculum examination. Secretions from the endocervix and vagina were collected with sterile swabs. One swab was inoculated directly onto a blood agar plate for culture. The other was initially placed into a Culturette transport system and then transferred into a test tube containing an enzyme extraction reagent. After a 60-minute incubation at 37C, the latex fixation test was performed on the residual liquid in the tube. The frequency of positive cultures in our population was 5.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid slide test were 88 and 99.6%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 91.7 and 99.4%, respectively. The group B streptococci latex fixation test appears to be a rapid and reliable means of detecting group B streptococci in the lower genital tract of term patients with intact membranes. Use of this method should permit a more selective approach to the intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of women colonized with group B streptococci.\r"

Eyes were evaluated on the first and on the eighth postoperative day. The appearance of the epithelium was graded on a scale from 0 to 4. Independent variables, such as donor age, patient age, patient and donor sex, death to preservation time, and donor time in K-Sol media prior to surgery, were also evaluated. Donor corneas treated with collagen demonstrated less epithelial staining and smaller epithelial defects on the first day following surgery. The results were evaluated with a Student's t test and were found to be significant (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the application of porcine collagen shields following keratoplasty is an effective means of encouraging reepithelialization of the graft.\r"

The occurrence of oral self-mutilation with a functional cause represents a diagnostic challenge to practitioners. In this article, a case of autoextraction of multiple posterior teeth in a psychotic 27-year-old white man is presented. Though a wide range of self-mutilation in a person in a psychotic state is well documented, oral self-mutilation, particularly autoextraction, is rare. Although the case reported is extreme in nature, incidence of oral self-mutilation is not uncommon and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions of unknown cause.\r"

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the combination of nystatin and chlorhexidine digluconate on Candida albicans in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for the combination of the two drugs was found to be significantly higher than the values for each of the drugs alone, approximately 33 times the MIC value for the nystatin solution and 4 times the value for chlorhexidine digluconate. The results of the MIC study and the presence of a precipitate in all combinations of nystatin and chlorhexidine digluconate showed that the combination of the drugs is not effective in vitro against Candida albicans. The most likely reason is that a low solubility chlorhexidine-nystatin salt is formed, thus rendering the combined drug complex ineffective as an antibiotic agent.\r"

The efficacy of antiepileptic drugs and the prediction of outcome of patients with neonatal seizures are controversial.

  ".W": "Infantile spasms constitute a relatively rare disorder of infancy and early childhood; their onset is usually within the first 6 to 8 months of life. A large percentage of patients with this disorder (85-90 per cent) show various degrees of retardation. Infantile spasms typically occur in clusters immediately on arousal, or soon thereafter, but rarely occur while the infant is actually asleep. The usual interictal EEG pattern associated with infantile spasms is hypsarrhythmia, but infantile spasms may occur in the absence of this EEG pattern. The pathophysiology of infantile spasms is not known, but recent evidence suggests that certain regions in the brain stem that are associated with sleep cycling may be responsible for the clinical and EEG manifestations of this disorder. At present, the only known effective treatment for infantile spasms is ACTH or corticosteroids. The therapeutic efficacy of these two agents is relatively equal, and one drug may be effective if the other drug fails. The effectiveness of certain traditional anticonvulsants (valproic acid and the benzodiazepines) and pyridoxine in the treatment of infantile spasms has not been adequately assessed. The long-term mental and developmental outcome of patients with infantile spasms is poor. The only factor that appears to be important in terms of long-term outcome is whether the patient is initially classified as cryptogenic or symptomatic, with the cryptogenic patients having the better outcomes. Approximately half of the infantile spasm patients will continue to have other types of seizures after their spasms stop.\r"

Tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a very frightening event; the inexperienced parents invariably believe that their child is dying. Emergent management is imperative for convulsive tonic-clonic (grand mal) status epilepticus, but there are nonconvulsive types of status epilepticus in which the problem is more one of correct diagnosis than emergent management. This article reviews aspects of status epilepticus, particularly the classification and treatment of the various types of status.\r"

Although most of the abnormalities will not alter management of the child, in a small but significant percentage an unexpected neoplasm or other treatable lesion will be discovered. In addition, even when the CT scan does not alter therapeutic management, it may offer the clinician valuable information regarding the etiology of the seizures. A normal CT scan also serves to ensure both the physician and the parent that \"nothing is being missed.\" As a guideline, I would recommend that all patients, with the exception of those with absence seizures, benign rolandic epilepsy, febrile seizures, and typical absence seizures have a CT scan with and without contrast enhancement. Even with a normal CT scan, however, the physician should follow the patient closely because a change in neurologic examination or the development of focal slowing on the EEG indicates the necessity for a repeat study.\r"
