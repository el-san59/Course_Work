  ".W": "CAD results from atherosclerosis, a chronic disease process that has its origin in childhood. Children and adolescents can be at higher risk for CAD by virtue of being from families with premature CAD or familial dyslipoproteinemias. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels result from a number of complex metabolic processes that are under the control of genetic and environmental (e.g., diet) influences. The normal ranges of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in children are known, and children and adolescents with dyslipoproteinemia are ordinarily defined as those having levels of plasma total, LDL, or triglyceride above the 95th percentile or with a low HDL cholesterol below the 5th percentile. Children of a parent with documented dyslipoproteinemia or with family history of premature CAD may be screened in the fasting state any time after 2 years of age. Following the exclusion of secondary causes of dyslipoproteinemia, the diagnosis of primary dyslipoproteinemia can be made. Lipoprotein patterns are not diagnostic for a given genotype. Efforts to determine further the biochemical defects responsible for a given phenotype have led to the investigation of gene coding for the apolipoproteins, the key enzymes in the lipoproteins pathways (LPL, HDL, and LCAT) and the receptors that process lipoproteins, such as the LDL receptor and the chylomicron remnant receptor. From a practical standpoint, the diagnosis of the kind of dyslipoproteinemia in a child will depend upon the nature and severity of the dyslipoproteinemia, both in the child (or adolescent) and in parents and siblings. Marked increases in plasma total and LDL cholesterol in the child and in at least one of the parents often reflect the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited dominant condition due to a defect in the LDL receptor gene. The triglyceride levels are often normal. If the child has a different dyslipoproteinemia pattern from siblings and parents, then the diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia should be considered. Most children with mild or borderline elevations in total and LDL cholesterol will have polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Triglyceride problems in children and adolescents are relatively uncommon, particularly the more severe hypertriglyceridemia such as that found in lipoprotein lipase and apoC-II deficiency, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and type V hyperlipoproteinemia. High levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein, in isolation or in combination with other dyslipoproteinemia, accelerate risk for CAD. Low levels of HDL cholesterol in the absence of other abnormalities suggest the diagnosis of hypoalphalipoproteinemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen full-term newborns with respiratory failure associated with pneumonia (7 patients) and meconium aspiration syndrome (7 patients) were treated with 90 mg/kg of a calf lung surfactant extract, given intratracheally up to every 6 hours for a maximum of four doses. The group mean fraction of inspired oxygen (FI02) before treatment was 0.99 +/- 0.01 SEM, and the mean airway pressure (MAP) was 14.6 +/- 1.0 cm H2O. Patients showed significant improvement in oxygenation after initial surfactant treatment, with the arterial-alveolar oxygenation ratio (a/A ratio) rising from 0.09 +/- 0.01 before surfactant treatment to 0.22 +/- 0.05 by 15 minutes (P = .03) and remaining improved for 6 hours. The oxygenation index, incorporating MAP as well as oxygen variables, also improved significantly from 26.2 +/- 3.1 to 11.2 +/- 1.7 at 15 minutes (P less than .001), with improvement sustained for more than 6 hours. Chest radiographs were blindly scored from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe opacification), and these improved with marginal significance after initial surfactant treatment (from 2.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.2, P = .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dosing regimen was 20 mg/kg five times daily for 5 days. Significant benefits were noted in the BSS group compared with placebo as manifested by decreases in stool frequency and stool weights and an improvement in stool consistency, significant improvement in clinical well-being, and shortening of the disease duration. Patients treated with BSS had a significant reduction in duration of hospital stay (6.9 days) compared with placebo-treated patients (8.5 days). Also, intravenous fluid requirements decreased significantly more rapidly and to a greater degree in the BSS-treated group. Bismuth subsalicylate was associated with clearance of pathogenic Escherichia coli from the stools in 100% of cases but was not different from placebo in rotavirus elimination. Bismuth subsalicylate was well tolerated with no reported adverse effects. Blood bismuth and serum salicylate levels were well below levels considered toxic. In this study, BSS provided effective adjunctive therapy for acute diarrhea, allowing children to get well sooner with less demand on the nursing and hospital staff.\r"

The responses from departments of pediatrics and housestaff were not significantly different from those of community practitioners in most categories. The reported rate of use of glucose-electrolyte solutions recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics was not different from the use of nonphysiologic, high-osmolar, low-salt solutions such as sodas and juices. The usage rate for glucose-electrolyte solutions meeting the American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended carbohydrate-to-sodium ratio of less than 2:1 was less than 30%. Other findings included the general lack of agreement on the use of a single type of therapy and the common use of oral therapy only for mild or no dehydration. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that feeding be reintroduced in the first 24 hours of a diarrheal episode, the majority of respondents withhold feeding until the second day or later. These findings indicate that educational programs on oral therapy during acute diarrhea are needed in the United States.\r"

The FirstTemp underestimated other measurements of body temperature in the \"Cal-tympanic\" mode and overestimated them in the \"Cor-tympanic\" mode. In the \"Cal-surface\" mode, the First-Temp readings were significantly lower than tympanic membrane temperatures measured with a thermistor probe and electronic thermometer (mean difference 0.2 degrees C) but not significantly different from rectal or axillary temperatures. According to these results, the FirstTemp can be used reliably in the \"Cal-surface\" mode but not in the \"Cal-tympanic\" or \"Cor-tympanic\" mode. Its speed and ease of operation offer significant advantages over traditional clinical methods of temperature measurement.\r"

Seven patients displayed bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. Of these, six patients required tracheostomy. Surgical injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve was the probable cause in two patients. The other seven patients had neurologic disorders with documented or suspected increases of intracranial pressure. Four of the seven patients with bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis regained cord mobility within 4 months. Both children with unilateral cord paralysis have no stridor and vocalize well 1 year later. Cord paralysis in the setting of intracranial hypertension probably results from compression or ischemia of the vagus nerve before it exits the skull. Early visualization of the larynx should be done in patients who become stridulous when extubated, especially those with prior thoracic procedures or with neurologic disorders associated with intracranial hypertension.\r"

As judged by the author(s) on the morning after the intubation, correct initial placement was achieved in 69 (78%) of 88 intubations using the new system, compared with 71 (66%) of 107 using the standard technique (Fisher's Test, one-tailed, P = .044). Repositioning was actually done in 23 (26%) of 88 TRACH MATE intubations, compared with 42 (39%) of 107 standard intubations (Fisher's test, one-tailed; P = .037). Intubation of the right main bronchus occurred in 7 standard intubations, but in none of the TRACH MATE intubations (Fisher's test, one-tailed; P = .014). Endotracheal tube position (high, low, or appropriate) was correctly determined by TRACH MATE in 77 (90%) of 85 intubations; the position was not recorded on three occasions. No differences in the number of complications (eg, unplanned extubations, distal displacement, subglottic stenosis) were found between the two groups. It is concluded that the TRACH MATE technique is superior to the standard clinical method in initial placement of the endotracheal tube.\r"

A total of 2982 patients were identified. Blood cultures were obtained from 1666 (56%). Of the 1666 patients, who had blood drawn for cultures, 50 (3.0%) had bacteremia. These included 39 with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 with Haemophilus influenzae, 2 with Neisseria meningitidis, 3 with Salmonella species, and 2 with Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of bacteremia increased at higher temperatures, being 1.9% at temperatures less than or equal to 40 degrees C and 5.0% at temperatures greater than 40 degrees C. Younger children were more likely to have bacteremia; 3.7% less than or equal to 12 months of age, 2.4% 13 to 24 months of age, and 1.9% 25 to 36 months of age had blood culture results that were positive (not significant). Reevaluation of the 50 bacteremic patients showed that 9 patients had continued fever, 3 patients had persistent bacteremia, pneumonia developed in 1 patient, and meningitis developed in 1 patient. It was concluded that (1) 3% of young febrile children with otitis media have bacteremia at the time of evaluation, a rate comparable to that previously reported in children with no focus of infection; (2) the incidence of bacteremia increases at higher temperatures; and (3) most febrile children with otitis media do well. The clinician must therefore weigh the potential benefit of drawing a blood culture to identify children at risk for complications against the inherent cost, inconvenience, and discomfort.\r"

A 2-year randomized, controlled trial involving 95 children measured the impact of a comprehensive home and ambulatory program for pediatric asthma management using objective outcome measures. Interventions for the study group during the first year included 3-month clinic visits, education, and home visits by a specially trained research nurse. Control subjects continued to receive regular care from a family physician or pediatrician. Eight-nine subjects (93%) completed the study. Study subjects had less school absenteeism than control subjects (10.7 vs. 16.0 days, P = .04) and showed significantly better small airway function after 1 year. Asthma severity improved in 13 study subjects and worsened in 5. The reverse was true for control subjects. Study subjects exhibited better metered aerosol technique than control subjects (P = .0005). Fewer days were spent in hospital by the study subjects admitted compared with control subjects (3.67 vs 11.2 days, P = .02). After 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, P = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the asthma management. The intervention failed to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke or to household pets. There were no significant differences in medical visits, theophylline levels, or records of asthma symptoms. One year after discontinuing the intervention, a marked \"washout\" effect was observed. Comprehensive ambulatory programs of childhood asthma management can improve objective measures of illness severity but must be sustained.\r"

Although an increased risk of respiratory illness was associated with attending day care for children in all three age groups, this risk was statistically significant only for children 6 weeks through 17 months of age (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.1 to 2.4) and children 18 through 35 months of age who had no older siblings (odds ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 2.0 to 6.0). In contrast, day-care attendance was not associated with an increased risk of respiratory illness in children 18 through 35 months of age with older siblings (odds ratio = 1.0). For children aged 6 weeks through 17 months, the exposure to older siblings was associated with an increased risk of respiratory illness; however, for children aged 36 through 59 months, older siblings were protective against respiratory illness. In addition, for the children in each age group currently in day care, increased duration of past exposure to day care was associated with a decreased risk of respiratory illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The expected birth weight-specific survival advantage for female neonates and black neonates diminished when the data were controlled for gestational age, showing that certain previously reported survival advantages are based on lower birth weight for a given gestational age. Multivariate analysis showed that all tested variables were significant predictors for survival, in order of descending significance: gestational age and birth weight, sex, race, single birth, and small-for-gestational-age status. The powerful effect of gestational age on survival highlights the need for an accurate neonatal tool to assess the gestational age of very low birth weight neonates after birth.\r"

During a 24-month period, nine such children were identified through a multihospital and coroner's office monitoring system in a single urban county. Injuries ranged from multiple abrasions and contusions to serious leg and head injuries. Three children died. The typical circumstance involved a child releasing the brake or placing the vehicle in gear in a private driveway which resulted in the vehicle striking or rolling over the victim. In four of the nine cases, the child who set the vehicle in motion fell or jumped from the vehicle and then became the injured victim. The extent of these unusual motor vehicle-related injuries is unknown because they are unlikely to be reported in official police statistics. According to the study findings, there is a need to educate the public and health professionals about the risks associated with leaving a child unattended in a motor vehicle and the hazardous environment of the private driveway. Preventive measures would include not leaving a child unattended in a vehicle, locking unattended vehicles to prevent access, and redesigning of private driveways.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, measles outbreaks have occurred among unimmunized children in inner cities in the United States. From May 1988 through June 1989, 1214 measles cases were reported in Los Angeles, and from October 1988 through June 1989, 1730 cases were reported in Houston. More than half of cases were in children younger than 5 years of age, most of whom were unvaccinated. Of cases of measles in preschool-aged children, nearly one fourth in Los Angeles and more than one third in Houston were reported by one inner-city emergency room. To evaluate whether emergency room visits were a risk factor for acquiring measles, in Los Angeles, 35 measles patients and 109 control patients with illnesses other than measles, and in Houston, 49 measles patients and 128 control patients, who visited these emergency rooms, were enrolled in case-control studies. Control patients were matched to case patients for ethnicity, age, and week of visit. Records were reviewed to determine whether case patients had visited the emergency room during the period of potential measles exposure, which was defined as 10 to 18 days before rash onset, and whether control patients had visited 10 to 18 days before their enrollment visit. In Los Angeles, 23% of case patients and 5% of control patients (odds ratio = 5.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.7, 15.9; P less than .01), and in Houston, 41% of case patients and 6% of control patients (odds ratio = 8.4, 95% confidence interval = 3.3, 21.2; P less than .01), visited the emergency room during these periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is believed to represent a variation of normal growth, and it is expected that children with this condition will grow for a longer duration than average and reach a height that is normal for their genetic potential. The records of children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty who were initially seen in the Pediatric Endocrine Clinic at the Oregon Health Sciences University between 1975 and 1983 were retrospectively reviewed. Criteria for study included a height more than 2 SD below the mean, a significantly delayed bone age, and a normal growth velocity on follow-up. Forty-two subjects were located and final adult height measurements were obtained. AT contact, the 29 male subjects (mean age = 23.9 years) were 169.5 +/- 4.5 cm tall (mean +/- SD), and the 13 female subjects (mean age = 20.5 years) were 156 +/- 3.8 cm tall. Adult height predictions during follow-up, using either the Bayley-Pinneau or Roche-Wainer-Thissen method, were close to final adult heights. The males were 1.2 SD and the females 1.3 SD below the 50th percentile as adults. This finding was not fully explained by genetic short stature; the males fell 5.1 cm and the females 5.3 cm below target heights based on midparental heights. It is concluded that this discrepancy is most likely explained by a selection bias of the shortest children referred to and observed in a subspecialty clinic, although a defect in human growth hormone secretion or function in children at the far end of the spectrum of constitutional delay of growth and puberty cannot be excluded.\r"

A biracial sample of 159 children and adolescents were classified as having a low, intermediate, or high renin-sodium profile based on the relationship between their plasma renin activity and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. Casual (106/58 vs 107/61 vs 106/62 mm Hg) and awake (116/69 vs 117/69 vs 116/70 mm Hg) blood pressure values were comparable among subjects with low, intermediate, and high renin-sodium profiles. Subjects with high renin-sodium profiles, however, had a smaller decline in systolic blood pressure with sleep than did subjects with low renin-sodium profiles (7 vs 11 mm Hg; P less than .04), and higher diastolic blood pressure readings during sleep than subjects with intermediate renin-sodium profiles (65 vs 62 mm Hg; P less than .05). Subjects with high renin-sodium profiles also had greater variance of diastolic blood pressure readings during sleep than either subjects with low renin-sodium profiles (P less than .01) or those with intermediate renin-sodium profiles (P less than .02). The blunted nocturnal decline and increased nocturnal variance of blood pressure among subjects with high renin-sodium profiles may be a marker or mechanism for the future development of essential hypertension.\r"

Blood flow measures indicated that reduced perfusion was greatest at the distraction site but extended proximally and distally. Finally, NMEPs were more sensitive to onset of overdistraction and a more valid indicator of paraplegia than SEPs. NMEPs should provide the surgeon with more time for initiation of intervention techniques than SEPs. Because NMEPs and SEPs provide information regarding different spinal cord tracts, the authors continue to use both methods for monitoring the functional integrity of the human spinal cord during corrective spine surgery.\r"

Cystometrograms were performed pre- and post-operatively and three months after constriction. Cortical evoked potentials were monitored pre- and post-operatively and monthly for three months. After three months of constriction, the cauda equina of these dogs in each group was examined histologically and vascular circulation was examined by latex and India ink injection (Spalteholz technique). The control dogs had normal CMGs and CEPs. Twenty-five percent constriction caused no CMG changes and mild CEP changes. Fifty percent constriction caused no statistically significant CMG changes, major CEP changes and venous congestion of the nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Seventy-five percent constriction produced severe CMG changes with detrusor areflexia, increased bladder capacity and clinical incontinence. CEPs also had marked deterioration. Vascular analysis revealed severe arterial narrowing at the level of constriction and venous congestion of the nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Blockage of axoplasmic flow and nerve root atrophy was seen in all dogs with 75% constriction. Cortical evoked potentials were the most sensitive predictor of neural compression. CMGs were not sensitive until severe compression was achieved. Bladder dysfunction, i.e., detrusor areflexia, appears to occur with blockage of axoplasmic flow and early sensory changes occur with neurovenous congestion.\r"

Data were then processed by polygon surface tiling to create three-dimensional color images of the spine and lungs for display. This computer technique allowed: 1) visualization of the anatomic relationships from any angle, 2) assessment of spinal deformity in relation to lung volume, and 3) measurement of individual lung volumes. Three-dimensional microcomputer imaging is a useful technique in objectively measuring lung volume and assessing postoperative changes.\r"

This measurement of anterior column structures describes the anterior spinal deformity. The posterior spinal deformity can be described by the \"spinous process angle,\" measured from a curve joining the tips of the spinous processes. A computer model, and a radiographic study of Cobb angle, spinous process angle and vertebral rotation show that adolescent idiopathic scoliosis results in larger angulations of the anterior elements than posterior elements. This helps to explain some of the inherent limitations of posterior instrumentation, including Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation, and of noninvasive posterior surface measurement systems.\r"

It possesses a greatly expanded dose response curve that allows a very broad range of x-ray dose to produce a diagnostic image. Potential advantages include significantly reduced radiation exposure without loss of image quality, acquisition of images of constant density irrespective of under or over exposure, and reduced repeat rates for unsatisfactory films. The authors prospectively studied 30 adolescents with scoliosis who had both conventional (full dose) and digital (full, one-half, or one-third dose) x-rays. They found digital made AP and lateral image with all anatomic areas clearly depicted at full and one-half dose. Digital laterals were better at full dose and equal to conventional at one-half dose. Cobb angles were easily measured on all one-third dose AP and on 8 of 10 one-third dose digital laterals. Digital clearly depicted the Risser sign at one-half and one-third dose and the repeat rate was nil in this study, indicating digital compensates well for exposure errors. The study indicates that digital does allow radiation dose to be reduced by at least one-half in scoliosis patients and that it does have improved image quality with good contrast over a wide range of x-ray exposure.\r"

Single structural curves were treated in all patients. At this time, 2 patients have failed treatment, their curves progressing 12 degrees and 8 degrees, respectively. An additional 11 patients have successfully completed treatment, having reached skeletal maturity with no more than 5 degrees of curve progression. Their mean curve change was a 2.2 degrees decrease. The other 19 patients remain under treatment. The Charleston bending TLSO is worn only during nighttime sleeping hours. It is well tolerated, with excellent patient compliance and low psychological stress, and it may be as successful at curve control as other orthoses. Experience with more patients and longer follow-up is needed.\r"

The effect of pedicle screw angle and transfixation were studied. Untransfixed 0 degrees pedicle-to-pedicle (P-P) angle constructs with limited screw-bone torsional resistance are unstable 4R-4bar linkages. They will not resist lateral load or (when not in a rectangular position) axial load until the spinal column load shares. Untransfixed constructs with (0 degrees less than P-P angle less than 60 degrees) are structures. However, as P-P angle approaches 0 degrees, the structure becomes more flexible (unstable) and some internal force and moment components exponentially increase (starting at approximately a 30 degrees P-P angle). Transfixation eliminated the linkage instability and associated exponential increase in internal loads. These observations apply to all bilevel systems that allow no relative joint motion between pedicle screw and longitudinal member. If relative motion does exist, other types of linkage instability can occur.\r"

The implants tested were: 1) Drummond spinous process wires, 2) Harrington laminar hooks, 3) Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular screws, and 4) Steffee VSP transpedicular screws. The ultimate failure of each implant was compared with the bone mineral density of each vertebra to determine which implants, if any, were particularly advantageous in osteoporotic vertebrae. Before biomechanical testing, the spines were analyzed in vitro by dual photon absorptiometry to determine the bone mineral densities (gm/cm2) of each vertebra. The mean tensile loads to failure for each of the implants tested were as follows: Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular screws: 345 Newtons; spinous process wire/button: 382 Newtons; Steffee transpedicular screws: 430 Newtons; and laminar hooks: 646 Newtons. The difference between the loads to failure for laminar hooks and the other implants was significant (P less than 0.05) using one-way analysis of variance. The overall correlation coefficient for bone mineral density with ultimate load to failure was 0.30 (P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficients were 0.47 (P less than 0.001) for spinous process wires alone; 0.096 (not significant) for laminar hooks alone; 0.37 (P less than 0.001) for Cotrel-Dubousset pedicle screws; and 0.48 (P less than 0.001) for Steffee pedicle screws.

Animals were divided into 5 groups based on type of spinal construct, using rods of different diameters (3.2 mm, 4.8 mm, 6.4 mm) with or without rigid crosslinking to produce constructs of different stiffnesses. Stiffness data on 28 animals were obtained by removing the spines en bloc, at 6 or 12 weeks postoperatively, and performing load-deformation testing in axial and torsional loading to determine the stiffness of the fusion masses (rods removed). The initial construct stiffnesses were also compared by ex vivo testing on spine specimens to correlate initial construct stiffness with eventual fusion mass stiffness. In axial testing, results showed stiffer fusion masses from larger diameter rod constructs compared with smaller rod constructs. This was similar to results of control testing on spine specimens ex vivo. Rigid crosslinking did not produce stiffer fusions in axial testing, due to a technical limitation of the button-wire implants used to segmentally fix the rods at each vertebra. In torsional testing, stiffer fusion masses resulted from using larger rods, and rigid Crosslinking also produced the stiffest fusion masses, which was consistent with ex vivo testing. In general, larger diameter (stiffer) rods produced stiffer fusion masses, and no evidence of stress shielding was found.\r"

A prospective randomized study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that application of a fibrin sealant to exposed cancellous bone can significantly reduce blood loss during Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis. A significant difference was demonstrated in total body loss, loss per level fused, and loss per kilogram of body weight when comparing the sealant group with random controls. A significant difference was demonstrated in loss per level fused when comparing the sealant control with a historical control group. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to the fibrin sealant or nonsealant groups; another 10 patients operated on before planning the study were included as historical controls. The sealant was used to control bleeding at the bone graft donor site and in the spine after decortication. All patients underwent Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to degree of curvature, number of levels fused, age or weight of patient, or operating time. Total blood loss in the sealant group averaged 672 ml compared with 894 ml in the sealant control group. No patient in the sealant group required homologous blood. Given the increasing awareness of the complications of blood transfusion, the authors conclude that fibrin sealant is a useful adjunct to spinal surgical technique.\r"

The data suggest that mild to moderate improvements in thoracic hypokyphosis are possible. When crossing the thoracolumbar junction, reversal of rod bend and reversal of hooks on the derotation rod appears to provide the most physiologic sagittal contour. Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation to the mid and distal lumbar spine can preserve and, at times, enhance lumbar lordosis.\r"

CDI produces torsional changes in the instrumented and uninstrumented spine that could result in spinal imbalance. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional analysis including computed tomography (CT) scans to measure vertebral rotation and segmental rotation were performed to evaluate the importance of torsional changes. Moe/King Type II deformities had a substantially greater risk of imbalance. Deformities instrumented over fewer spinal segments were less likely to decompensate. Specifically, instrumentation excluding the mobile transition segment, determined by maximum segmental rotation and segmental Cobb angle, was likely to decompensate. Derotation and deformity correction excessive in relation to preoperative side bending flexibility and segmental rotation frequently resulted in imbalance. Spinal imbalance after CDI can be reduced by avoiding overcorrection and inclusion of mobile transition segments.\r"

  ".W": "The authors reviewed the early complications in all patients fused to the sacro-pelvis using Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation at the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital. Sixteen patients were studied with an average follow-up of 13 months. Three methods of sacro-pelvis fixation were evaluated: iliosacral screws, sacral screws, and a technique whereby the caudle ends of the Cotrel-Dubousset rods were fashioned and inserted into the posterior iliac crest using the Galveston technique. Seven of the 16 sets of sacral screws (44%) failed during and after surgery. Two of the 7 sets of iliosacral screws failed postoperatively (28%). No failures occurred in the 8 sets of Cotrel-Dubousset rods placed with the Galveston technique. Seven of the nine medical complications observed (77%) occurred in the sacral screw group. Using calf spines, a biomechanical evaluation of each system was undertaken to determine strength of fixation. Each system was failed in flexion 3 times. The sacral screws were the weakest, pulling directly out of the sacrum at 40 N-M. Cotrel-Dubousset rods inserted with the Galveston technique were the strongest, experiencing rod deformities before flexion failure at 70 N-M. Iliosacral screws were of intermediate strength failing by rotation on the axis of the screws or pulling directly out of the ilium at 55 N-M. The authors conclude that using Cotrel-Dubousset rods inserted with the Galveston techniques was the strongest and safest method of sacro-pelvis fixation of the three tested.\r"

Twenty-two patients were treated nonsurgically and nine surgically. Patients had improved sitting balance and endurance after surgery. Complications of surgery included loss of correction in one patient, one pseudarthrosis, and one patient who required prolonged ventilatory support. The prolonged survival of patients with spinal muscular atrophy justifies aggressive orthopaedic management of scoliosis to prevent progression of deformity and improve sitting comfort.\r"

Twenty males and 34 females, ranging in age from 1 to 16 years, have been followed for a mean period of 5.5 years. Sixteen patients with a kyphosis averaging 113 degrees (range, 77 to 170 degrees) had correction of deformity to a mean of 35 degrees. Thirty-seven patients with a scoliosis averaging 73 degrees (range, 20 to 135 degrees) had correction to an average of 34 degrees (range, 0 to 75 degrees). There were 4 cases of deep wound infection successfully treated with drainage and antibiotics and only one case required implant removal after fusion/maturation. A pseudarthrosis was noted by radiograph in 6 patients, 3 of whom had isolated asymptomatic lumbosacral pseudarthroses. Three patients had pseudarthrosis at the thoracolumbar junction. These required repair and were successfully treated by supplemental posterior fusion resulting in an overall pseudarthrosis rate of 5.7%. Anterior fusion of the dysraphic spine allows greater correction of both spinal deformity and pelvic obliquity in addition to contributing significant strength to the fusion mass. Segmental spinal instrumentation with sublaminar and pedicular wiring to custom-contoured Luque rods provides excellent correction and immediate postoperative stability.\r"

The SI is a measurement of the kyphotic segmental deformity corrected for the normal sagittal contour at the level of the deformed segment. A prospective study was devised in 1986 for burst fracture treatment. Complete data were available on 35 patients (22 males, 13 females), with an average follow-up of 27 months. SI was greater than 15 degrees in the first group, the members of which were treated surgically. The technique is described. SI was less than 15 degrees in the third group, the members of which were treated conservatively. The second control group included patients with SI greater than 15 degrees but who were not treated according to the authors protocol for independent reasons. The results suggest that SI is a useful criteria to assess deformity and predict progression of segmental kyphosis.\r"

Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal. The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced.\r"

Defects repaired with suture alone initially leaked within the range of physiologic pressurization, while those supplemented with tissue adhesive or repaired with tissue adhesive alone failed at higher pressurization levels. Histologic sections obtained from the dura treated with fibrin adhesive sealant demonstrated minimal inflammatory response not significantly different than those sections examined at sites repaired by suture alone. A new substance, fibrin adhesive sealant, appears to be useful in effecting dural repair due to its ability to withstand pressures greater than those obtained with suture alone.\r"

Resultant contact load locations shifted in a predictable manner. Caudal shift in contact locations occurred with chymopapain treatment or discectomy but was variable with capsulectomy. Facet load changed with applied load magnitude and direction; no significant change was noted after intradiscal chymopapain, discectomy, or capsulectomy. The significance of the lack of force change with disc narrowing is unknown. Perhaps, observed facet degeneration results from a change in the joint motion and contact location rather than change in facet load.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most important factors in the management of insulinomas is the ability to localize the tumor accurately either before or during surgery. We prospectively carried out transhepatic portal venous sampling (THPVS) for tumor localization in 35 of 40 patients with organic hyperinsulinism during a 10-year period. In 32 patients who underwent THPVS and in whom a single tumor was subsequently identified surgically, the maximal insulin gradient was located in the vicinity of the tumor in 100% of cases. Specific regionalization of the tumor on the basis of the site of the maximal insulin gradient to one of three regions (the tail, the body/neck region, and the head/uncinate region) gave a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 91%. In contrast, the use of specific cutoff levels for the insulin gradient as a guide to the presence of a tumor in one of these three regions did not increase the accuracy, leading instead to a significant loss of sensitivity with no comparable increase in specificity. There were no major complications from the procedure in any patient. The initial use of computed tomographic/ultrasound scanning and selective angiography localized only 46% of tumors, whereas subsequent THPVS led to the accurate preoperative localization of 100% of all tumors submitted to surgery. Although the surgeon would have identified 81% of the tumors correctly at operation, in 19% (n = 6) he would have failed. Four tumors were in the uncinate and two were in the head. It seems that in patients with proved or established organic hyperinsulinism, THPVS may continue to be of value, if only to regionalize the tumor, especially those in the pancreatic head and uncinate process so as to preclude noncurative operations on the body and tail of the pancreas.\r"

Common features in patients with ALRVF include abdominal pain (81%), hematuria (100%), impaired renal function (85%), and nonvisualization of the left kidney (100%). Less common but also present in the majority of cases are a left sided bruit (73%), pulsatile abdominal mass (63%), and proteinuria (50%). Also important, 94% have a retroaortic left renal vein, unlike the six cases of traumatic ALRVF that have been reported. This magnifies the diagnostic value of contrast abdominal computed tomographic scanning, which demonstrates not only the anomalous location of the left renal vein but also the abdominal aortic aneurysm and poor enhancement of the left kidney. These findings rule out the possibility of the \"nutcracker syndrome\" (left renal vein compression between aorta and superior mesenteric artery). Although confirming the presence of a fistula by early caval opacification, aortography does not always distinguish ALRVF from the more common aortocaval fistula. This can be accomplished by Duplex scanning with deep probes and even preferably color coding of velocity signals. With such precise preoperative localization, surgical repair is relatively easy and safe.\r"

  ".W": "In 1985, as a result of the high complication rate associated with anticoagulants in patients who have cancer and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), we established a policy of placing Greenfield filters (GFs) as primary therapy instead of anticoagulation. Since 1985 we have been asked to consult in the treatment of 18 patients with cancer and with DVT and/or PE, and we have placed a GF in each of these patients. This represented 34% (18/53) of the filters placed during that same period. Over the same 4-year period, 11 patients with cancer and DVT and/or PE underwent anticoagulation therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of anticoagulation versus GF insertion in these two groups of patients. A significantly higher number of major complications (n = 4) occurred in the anticoagulation group (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) than in the GF group (n = 0). The four complications that occurred in the anticoagulation group included three bleeding episodes (tumor bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hip hematoma) and one PE, despite adequate anticoagulation. Two patients died as a direct result of these complications (PE and gastrointestinal bleeding). The three patients with bleeding complications each required a transfusion of more than 3 units of blood. All four of the patients with complications had metastatic disease (pancreatic carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate carcinoma, and uterine carcinoma). Although this is a small, nonrandomized, nonprospective study, the data seem to indicate that GF placement is safer than anticoagulation for DVT or PE in patients with cancer and particularly in patients with metastatic disease. We conclude that GF insertions may be a better primary treatment than anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Prosthetic small-caliber vascular grafts give poorer patency rates than autogenous vein grafts, possibly because the former never spontaneously form endothelium. Animal studies have shown that endothelialization of prosthetic grafts can be encouraged by seeding endothelial cells into the graft at the time of surgery, resulting in improved patency. Information regarding the attachment characteristics of adult human endothelial cells to prosthetic grafts is, however, sparce. Laboratory experiments were performed by use of cell culture techniques to compare the attachment characteristics of adult human endothelial cells to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft material, both untreated and treated, with one of four protein substrates--preclotted blood, fibronectin, laminin, and type 4 collagen. Attachment characteristics were compared quantitatively by use of attachment assays and qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy. Attachment to untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was poor but could be greatly improved by preclotting or precoating with any of the proteins, particularly fibronectin. In preclotted grafts seeded endothelial cells formed a virtually confluent monolayer after 1 hour. Cell attachment to the other grafts coated with protein was patchy and inconsistent. It is concluded that a rapid confluent endothelial lining within a prosthetic vascular graft is possible, and of the substrates examined, preclotted blood best encourages cell attachment to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.\r"

  ".U": "91081924\r", 
  ".W": "We have performed intraoperative isotopic infusions of carbon 14-labeled leucine in 65 patients to define the abnormalities in protein metabolism at both the whole-body and tissue level in patients with weight-losing and non-weight-losing cancer. Eighteen patients had benign disease, 26 had non-weight-losing cancer, and 21 had cancer cachexia. Samples of plasma and expired breath were taken to determine rates of whole-body protein synthesis (WBPS), whole-body protein catabolism (WBPC), net protein catabolism, and albumin fractional synthetic rates. Tissue samples were taken to determine the fractional synthetic rates (FSR) of protein in muscle, liver, cancer, and the tissue in which the cancer arose. In addition, in 14 patients the effect of nutritional support on protein metabolism was assessed. In all parameters examined we were unable to detect any significant differences between patients with no cancer and the patients with non-weight-losing cancer. In contrast, patients with cancer cachexia had a significant elevation (p less than 0.005) in WBPC compared with the other two groups. WBPS was also elevated (to a lesser extent) in the patients with cancer cachexia, and the rate of net protein catabolism was increased significantly (p less than 0.05). Patients with cancer cachexia also had significantly higher values of FSR of protein in muscle (p less than 0.05), liver (p less than 0.05), and albumin (p less than 0.01) compared with the other two groups. In addition, the protein FSR in the cancer rose progressively when the values for the primary cancer were compared with those for nodal and systemic metastases. Further, although nutritional support resulted in an increase in host muscle protein synthesis (p less than 0.04), there was no promotion of FSR of protein in cancer. We conclude that patients with cancer cachexia are actively losing protein as a result of an increase in WBPC that is only partially compensated for by an increase in WBPS. There are compensatory increases in protein synthesis in muscle and liver, but these increases in host protein synthesis are insufficient to keep pace with the combined effect of the accelerated rate of protein synthesis in the cancer per se and the accelerated rate of net protein catabolism at the whole-body level. In response to nutritional support, there is a significant increase in the muscle protein synthesis, but we could not demonstrate any increase in cancer protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory lung disorders including asthma, emphysema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The precursors of these destructive cells are thought to be marginating neutrophils that, although intravascular, remain intimately associated with endothelium, resisting the shearing forces of flowing blood. The purposes of this study were (1) to examine a method for quantitating marginating lung neutrophils, (2) to assess the adherence of marginating neutrophils to normal lung endothelium, and (3) to determine the reversibility of neutrophil-endothelial cell adherence. Rats were anesthetized and ventilated, and their lungs were exposed through a median sternotomy. The left lung was tied off with blood in situ and the right lung was perfused intraarterially with colloid for 2 minutes. In separate experiments, both left and right lungs were perfused intraarterially with colloid for 25 minutes. Myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil granule enzyme, was related to lung neutrophils. Dithionite-sensitive optical density (DSOD) was related to lung hemoglobin. Marginating lung neutrophils were quantitated by measuring the peroxidase activity of normal blood-perfused lung (myeloperoxidase assay) and subtracting from it the fraction of activity corresponding to the lung blood content (DSOD). The marginating neutrophil pool was identified by 2.1 units myeloperoxidase (5 x 10(6) neutrophils) per gm wet lung. Although the marginating pool was depleted by 54% during 2 minutes of lung colloid perfusion, lung erythrocytes (DSOD) were decreased by a significantly greater 93% (p less than 0.05). Lungs perfused with colloid for 25 minutes had negligible remaining myeloperoxidase activity. We conclude that (1) marginating lung neutrophils can be quantitated with the myeloperoxidase and DSOD assays, (2) marginating neutrophils are relatively adherent to normal lung endothelium compared with intravascular erythrocytes, and (3) the adherence of marginating neutrophils is fully reversible.\r"

We thus conducted a prospective study to define risk factors and outcome in these patients. Over a 19-month period 6% of liver transplants were followed by Pseudomonas bacteremia. The mean age was 46 years (range, 24 to 67 years). The interval between transplantation and onset of bacteremia was 3 to 372 days (mean, 80). The incidence of Pseudomonas bacteremia in liver transplants was three times that of other transplants (heart, lung, kidney). Ninety one percent of infections were nosocomial. Polymicrobial bacteremia occurred in 30% of episodes. The portal of entry was respiratory in 30%, abdominal in 35%, and biliary in 13%. Four patients had recurrent Pseudomonas bacteremia: liver abscess (1), biliary obstruction (2), subhepatic abscess (1). Survival at 14 days was 70%. Survival rates were significantly lower for patients with hypotension, on mechanical ventilators, and increasing severity of illness (p less than 0.05). Survival was higher when bacteremia occurred within the first 30 days after transplantation compared to after 30 days. A large number (43.4%) of Pseudomonas bacteremias occurred after transplant surgery of biliary tract manipulation, while the patient was receiving a prophylactic regimen of cefotaxime and ampicillin. P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen in the liver transplant recipient; prevention may be possible for a subgroup of patients with the use of prophylactic antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa.\r"

Without DMSO, PGI2 production was significantly higher in CFR versus control animals (8.65 +/- 1.0 vs 6.38 +/- 0.3 ng/15 min [p less than 0.02]). DMSO did not influence PGI2 production in any of the groups but significantly reduced the number of atheromatous lesions in CFR (78% +/- 9% vs 8% +/- 4% [p less than 0.001]). With DMSO, CFR had a significant reduction in total lipid levels (422 +/- 5 vs 300 +/- 21 mg/gm dry wt [p less than 0.01]) and cholesterol levels (74 +/- 12.8 vs 31.8 +/- 6.4 mg/gm dry wt [p less than 0.01]) compared with control animals. Fibrinogen levels were significantly lower in CFR versus control animals (0.83 +/- 0.07 vs 2.42 +/- 0.13 mg/ml [p less than 0.01]). TXB2 was lower in DMSO plus control versus control animals alone. In conclusion, DMSO does not appear to act through changes in PGI2 or fibrinogen activity. Its effect in lowering TXB2 in CFR suggests an action on platelet function.\r"

  ".U": "91081928\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the effect of exogenous hyaluronic acid (HA) on healing of experimental wounds, responses in the hamster cheek pouch were measured after a hole was cut through the tissue with a biopsy punch. Fluorescence-labeled dextran was administered intravenously as a macromolecular tracer and the microcirculation was observed in vivo with a fluorescence microscope connected to a high-resolution television system. In one group a gelatin sponge soaked in 1.5 ml 16 mg/dl HA in water was applied topically at the time of injury and on postinjury days 1, 3, 5, and 7. The control group received the sponge soaked in the aqueous vehicle. Every 2 days after injury, the microcirculation was observed or histologic specimens were harvested. Wound size decreased almost twice as fast with HA compared with its vehicle (p less than 0.05). Healing was defined as time for total wound closure with at least one microvessel bridging the site of injury and required 16 or more days with vehicle but averaged less than 9 days with HA. Early during healing the repair site was surrounded by widespread extravasation of the fluorescent tracer, an index of inflammation; this area was reduced by two thirds 2 to 4 days after injury with HA compared with its vehicle (p less than 0.05). The density of perfused microvessels was twofold higher with HA 2 to 4 days after injury (p less than 0.05). However, microvessel density was similar in both groups by 6 days after injury and remained similar for at least 45 days after injury, which suggests that HA evoked no unusual angiogenic response. Histologic examination of fixed, stained specimens showed increases in intravascular leukocytes after injury and treatment-related differences in the distribution of intravascular leukocytes in 20 to 40 microns and 40 to 80 microns diameter microvessels 1 to 2 days after injury. Otherwise, leukocyte infiltration during healing was similar in both groups. The mechanism for the beneficial action of HA on healing is unknown. However, several in vitro studies suggest that HA is part of a feedback loop that promotes cell proliferation and migration in actively growing tissues. Alternatively, the role of HA in water homeostasis could favor tissue hydration, which has a well-known beneficial effect on healing.\r"

Penetrating trauma was the predominant mechanism and lower extremity arteries were most commonly involved. The morphology of these arterial injuries included 22 cases of intimal flaps, 21 cases of segmental arterial narrowing, 6 pseudoaneurysms, and 1 acute arteriovenous fistula. There was one death as a result of unrelated causes and another three injuries operated on immediately after arteriographic diagnosis. The remaining 46 injuries were followed up nonoperatively by serial arteriography (39) or clinical examination (7) during a mean interval of 3.1 months (range, 3 days to 27 months). Complete resolution was documented for 29 injuries (63%), whereas 3 improved, 9 remained unchanged, and 5 worsened during the period of follow-up. All worsened cases involved small or occult pseudoaneurysms that subsequently enlarged and then underwent immediate surgical repair without subsequent morbidity. Because 89% of the followed injuries never required surgery, nonoperative observation appears to be a safe and effective management option for clinically occult arterial injuries.\r"

Male Wistar rats were subjected to 10 minutes of forebrain ischemia by clamping both common carotid arteries and lowering blood pressure to 40 mm Hg. Histologic evaluation was performed 7 days after ischemia. Local cerebral blood flow was determined with the 14C-iodoantipyrine technique in anatomically defined areas of the brain, including hippocampus. Preischemic application of nimodipine (3.0 mg/kg p.o.) significantly reduced the percentage of damaged neurons in hippocampal CA1 subfield from 78 +/- 4% in controls to 59 +/- 6% in treated rats (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). After 10, 60, and 180 minutes of recirculation no differences in local cerebral blood flow between control and drug-treated animals were observed. Our results demonstrate that nimodipine reduces ischemia-induced neuronal damage in rat hippocampus. We did not consider increased cerebral blood flow in the hypoperfusion state in the applied experimental design since improvement of cerebral blood flow seems to bear little relation to the neuroprotective activity of nimodipine.\r"

We induced 15-minute global cerebral ischemia in pentobarbital-anesthetized and relaxed rabbits, which had been implanted with a transhippocampal dialysis probe, by intrathoracic artery occlusion combined with hypotension. A part from electroencephalographic and morphologic observations, changes in the extracellular concentrations of calcium, amino acids, and blood-brain barrier permeability to fluorescein were detected by microdialysis of the hippocampus. Nimodipine was applied either intravenously or locally to the hippocampus before, during, and after ischemia. Application of nimodipine locally or systemically, which had no effect on extracellular amino acids, enhanced recovery and normalization of the electroencephalographic activity and protected hippocampal neurons from early morphologic changes. Intravenous nimodipine reduced the ischemia-evoked drop of extracellular Ca2+ and completely prevented postischemic leakage of the blood-brain barrier, whereas local nimodipine infusion did not modify these ischemic disturbances. Our results suggest that nimodipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels play a minor role in the ischemic calcium influx to hippocampal neurons. Nimodipine, apart from a potent vasotropic action, may also directly protect brain neurons by intracellular calcium antagonism rather than by inhibition of calcium influx.\r"

The increase in calcium content of brain and kidney tissues and of plasma renin activity, urea, and creatinine was attenuated by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy. The histology of the kidneys revealed widespread fibrinoid necrosis of arteries in all rats. In the nimodipine-treated or parathyroidectomy groups, healing of the lesions was detectable. Cerebral lesions were mainly characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. Nimodipine-treated as well as parathyroidectomied animals showed significantly fewer hypertensive cerebral lesions. In old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, therapy with nimodipine or parathyroidectomy increased their survival rate. The cerebrovascular and renovascular lesions of treated animals were attenuated, and morphologic signs of healing were observed. Reduction of calcium overload by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy, even in an advanced stage of disease, had a therapeutic effect.\r"

Ultrastructural alterations of microvessels can either be attributed to degeneration or to deposition processes. Nimodipine application, irrespective of the time of onset, did not interfere with the degeneration of microvascular pericytes. However, nimodipine treatment from 24-30 months significantly reduced the amount of microvascular deposition products in cortical layers I and III, while an earlier onset (16 months) of the drug application resulted in a significant reduction in all motor cortex layers studied. This indicates a different susceptibility of microvessels in layer V of the frontoparietal motor cortex. These results show a beneficial effect of nimodipine on the integrity of cerebral microvasculature during aging and may provide a morphologic basis for the improved motor and cognitive performance in aged rats after chronic nimodipine application.\r"

The control animals were subjected to cerebral ischemia with no medication. Five days after ischemia, the state of CA1 sector neurons was morphometrically evaluated and compared with that in animals not subjected to an experimental procedure. Nimodipine exerted a full protective effect on CA1 pyramidal neurons only after repeated application extending over 24 hours after the ischemia. A less conspicuous effect was obtained with a single dose applied at a late postischemic period, and a double dose given in the peri-ischemic stage remained ineffective. The time-dependent effectiveness of nimodipine is discussed in relation to the characteristics of this model of cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia. However, they do not exclude the possibility that treatment may minimize the accumulation of calcium in damaged cells as a result of \"cytoprotective\" effects.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden fissuring of an atherosclerotic plaque has been suggested as the primary trigger of transient spontaneous ischemia in both the coronary and cerebral circulation. Measurements of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-TXB2, as well as results of Aspirin trials, have suggested that episodic platelet activation at the site of this acute vascular lesion is mediated, at least partly, by enhanced thromboxane (TX) A2 biosynthesis. Thus, episodic increases in metabolite excretion have been detected in unstable angina. Aspirin (75-325 mg/day) prevents about one third of all fatal and nonfatal thrombotic events in this setting. That a similar \"dynamic\" thrombotic process occurs during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction is suggested by thromboxane metabolite measurements and by the results of the ISIS-2 trial showing a similar impact of short-term Aspirin therapy to that seen in unstable angina. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with transiently enhanced TXA2 biosynthesis and Aspirin-suppressable periprocedural thrombotic complications. On the other hand, both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type IIa hypercholesterolemia are associated with a relatively reproducible and persisting abnormality of TXA2-dependent platelet function. This association is likely to reflect a systemic rather than localized stimulus to platelet activation and a continuous rather than episodic alteration. Low-dose (50 mg/day) Aspirin can largely suppress thromboxane metabolite excretion in both diseases. Thus, low-dose Aspirin and/or selective prostaglandin H2/TXA2-receptor antagonists may be important tools to test the hypothesis that TXA2-dependent platelet activation represents an important transducer of the enhanced thrombotic risk associated with these metabolic abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Neither low- nor very-low-dose Aspirin suppresses thromboxane A2 biosynthesis without inhibiting the formation of its functional antagonist prostacyclin. Although thromboxane synthase inhibitors selectively inhibit thromboxane A2 biosynthesis and increase prostacyclin formation in vivo, thromboxane synthase inhibitors can lead to an accumulation of prostaglandin H2 that substitutes for thromboxane A2 at their common receptors in platelets and smooth muscle. In contrast to those inhibitors of thromboxane A2 biosynthesis, thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonists do not affect the synthesis of prostacyclin and other prostaglandins but prevent thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 from activating platelets and inducing vasoconstriction. The available thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonists are competitive antagonists. However, some of them, such as daltroban, S-145, GR 32.191, and Bay U 3405, produce a noncompetitive antagonism in human platelets due to their low dissociation rate. As a consequence, agonists equilibrate with the antagonist-occupied receptor pool so slowly that they fail to induce platelet activation. This property of some antagonists strongly increases their potency and the duration of their inhibitory effect. Therefore, a low dissociation rate is an important measure of the effectiveness of a thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist in addition to its receptor affinity. Another approach in thromboxane A2 pharmacology is a combination of thromboxane synthase inhibition with thromboxane receptor antagonism in one drug, such as ridogrel. Such dual inhibitors present a very high inhibitory potential and prolong the skin bleeding time to a greater extent than Aspirin, thromboxane synthase inhibitors, or thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonists.\r"

We have previously demonstrated inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced sudden death by Bay U 3405. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Bay U 3405 on thromboembolism provoked by collagen. Collagen fibrils dissolved in an isotonic glucose solution were injected into a marginal ear vein of anesthetized rabbits. Sudden death occurred within a few minutes due to elevated thromboxane A2 levels causing intravascular platelet aggregation and myocardial ischemia. In the vehicle-treated group, 100% of the animals died. One of the most prominent parameters was the massive fall in blood pressure. All animals pretreated with 10 mg/kg orally Bay U 3405 survived, showing only a transient hypotensive effect. Tracings of the electrocardiogram and heart rate were unchanged. Bay U 3405 will therefore be useful to elucidate the role of thromboxane A2 in various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\r"

Bay U 3405 was administered intravenously 15 minutes after occlusion (1 mg/kg) followed by infusion of 10 mg/kg/hr from 30 minutes after ligature. In a second study, the effects of Bay U 3405 on endoperoxide analogue U-46619-induced coronary constriction were studied in anesthetized, open-chest pigs. Bay U 3405 reduced myocardial infarct expansion by 65% (p less than 0.01) assessed with biochemical staining. Hemodynamics and collateral blood flow were unaffected. However, reperfusion arrhythmias were suppressed. In porcine experiments, 1 mg/kg Bay U 3405, given intravenously or intraduodenally, antagonized U-46619-induced coronary vasoconstriction over 5 hours. The studies demonstrate anti-ischemic and antivasoconstrictor properties of Bay U 3405 probably due to binding to platelet and smooth muscle thromboxane receptors. This may have clinical relevance in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction.\r"

Forty-eight hours after vessel occlusion, the damage was quantified in rats by planimetry and subsequent integration on cresyl violet-stained serial sections and in mice by planimetric analysis of the damaged cortical surface after counterstaining with carbon black. All 5-HT1A agonists investigated substantially decreased cortical infarct size in the rat focal ischemia model (p less than 0.05). Drugs were applied 30 minutes before the induction of ischemia, and efficacy was demonstrated for 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg s.c.), buspirone (10 mg/kg i.p.), gepirone (10 mg/kg i.p.), ipsapirone (10 or 30 mg/kg i.p.), and Bay R 1531 (1 mg/kg i.p.). The most pronounced effects were seen with the higher dose of ipsapirone and Bay R 1531, both compounds reducing cortical infarct size by more than 60%. Except for 8-OH-DPAT, the 5-HT1A agonists also caused a reduction in total infarct volumes. In a separate series, ipsapirone (30 mg/kg i.p.), applied 1 hour after vessel occlusion, led to a reduction in cortical and total infarct volumes by about 50% compared with corresponding controls (p less than 0.05). In neither series was striatal damage influenced. We tested the compounds in the mouse ischemia model over a broad dose range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we hypothesized that 5-HT1A-receptor agonists might exert a neuroprotective effect. We tested the full agonists Bay R 1531 and 8-OH-DPAT and the partial agonists ipsapirone and gepirone in the model of transient global ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. Ipsapirone protected 53% of pyramidal neurons (p less than 0.05) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus from ischemic damage at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Bay R 1531 showed a powerful neuroprotective effect with 100% preservation of neurons at a dose of 3 mg/kg (p less than 0.001) while gepirone and 8-OH-DPAT were ineffective. These findings suggest that 5-HT1A-receptor agonists might be effective tools for the therapy of cerebral ischemia. However, the varying results indicate that transient forebrain ischemia in the gerbil may not be the optimal model system to demonstrate clearly the neuroprotective activity of these compounds.\r"

We implanted 17 silver ball electrodes symmetrically distributed over the skull in 14 rats and registered electroencephalography activity and somatosensory evoked potentials before, 1 hour, and 1 week after permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Before vessel occlusion, a symmetric distribution of electroencephalography power was seen over both hemispheres. Middle cerebral artery occlusion caused a complete abolishment of electroencephalography power in the frontolateral aspects of the affected hemisphere. When electroencephalographic recordings 7 days after the insult were superimposed with three-dimensional-reconstructed pictures of the infarct, a close correspondence of the extention and spatial orientation was noted. Two negative and two positive peaks were consistently recorded before middle cerebral artery occlusion. In both control and ipsapirone-treated (30 mg/kg i.p. 30 minutes after induction of ischemia) animals, the vessel occlusion caused a severe reduction in amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials in all areas under record (p less than 0.05). One week after middle cerebral artery occlusion, amplitudes of somatosensory potentials over the lesioned hemisphere were still significantly (p less than 0.05) lower than preischemic values in the control group. When compared with the corresponding values 1 hour after middle cerebral artery occlusion, an albeit insignificant tendency toward increased amplitudes was observed in most areas under record. By contrast, in ipsapirone-treated animals, significant differences compared with preischemic values were no longer present 1 week after the vessel occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These factors are important not only because they increase the risk of stroke, but also because they are amenable to modification by drugs, diet, or other interventions. Strategies to avoid stroke can either 1) try to produce substantial reductions, usually with drugs, in the level of the risk factor in the few individuals in the population with high levels (the \"high-risk\" approach), or 2) try to produce modest reductions in the level of the risk factor in every individual in the population, usually not with drugs but with lifestyle modification (the \"mass\" approach). The prevention of stroke could best be achieved through continuing medical efforts to deal with high-risk individuals and through political strategies to encourage a healthier lifestyle in the population as a whole.\r"

The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5).

Potassium depolarization evoked contraction and rhythmic activity that was blocked by nimodipine (IC50 0.08 nM). High concentrations of noradrenaline and prostaglandin F2 alpha were needed to elicit a contractile response. Intracerebral microarterioles were very sensitive to endothelin (ED50, 0.2 nM). The contractions evoked by concentrations of endothelin lower than or equal to ED50 were relaxed by nimodipine, which also blocked the amplified response to potassium chloride depolarization occurring with subthreshold concentrations of endothelin. We discuss these observations in relation to brain ischemia.\r"

Evidence supporting this link includes studies in cell cultures and measurements of calcium accumulation in the mitochondria during ischemia, as well as direct measurements of shifts in extracellular calcium using microelectrodes. Since it is dangerously high concentrations of the intracellular free calcium that have been hypothesized to lead to neuronal damage, direct in vivo measurements of this parameter in ischemia are important. A technique for the measurement of intracellular free calcium is described, along with data from studies that dramatically demonstrate the time course of changes in intracellular free calcium induced by focal ischemia. Additional data are also presented that indicate that cellular damage can be attenuated by the use of agents that block calcium channels (nimodipine, which blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and MK-801, which blocks receptor-operated channels) and support the concept that these agents owe their beneficial effects to their ability to reduce the accumulation of intracellular calcium.\r"

The brains were removed and examined by autoradiography. We observed a focal increase of nimodipine binding in severely ischemic regions at 5 minutes after occlusion, which also appeared in regions with presumed penumbral blood flow levels at 4 hours after occlusion. We hypothesize that nimodipine binds to activated calcium channels in ischemic tissue. This increased binding depends on the duration and severity of cerebral ischemia. Sequential measurements of nimodipine binding may allow the identification of regions with potentially reversible effects of ischemia and the monitoring of their response to therapy.\r"

Outcome was assessed with Mathew's scale and the physician's clinical judgement. The treatment and control groups were well matched with respect to demographic data, risk factors, and baseline Mathew scores. In the treatment group, 34 patients (7.9%) died during the treatment period, whereas 54 (12.3%) in the control group died, corresponding with a mortality reduction of 36%. Significantly less neurologic impairment at the end of the treatment period was documented under nimodipine treatment, and this impairment improved more in patients with moderate-to-severe stroke (baseline Mathew score less than 66) if administration of nimodipine occurred within 12 hours after stroke onset or if the patient was more than 65 years old. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was relatively modest, and these were of minor severity; only a few appeared to have more than a remote relation to the study medication.\r"

Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation. After 6, 12, or 24 hours, brains were frozen, and infarct size, degree of edema formation, and local brain pH were quantified by standard histology or the umbelliferone technique, respectively. In control rats, cortical infarct size was increased from 29.5 microliters at 6 hours to 72.5 microliters at 24 hours after vessel occlusion. In striatum only, an insignificant increase from 15.2 to 24.7 microliters in infarct volume was observed during this period. Edema increased from 7% to 22% in cortical and from 4% to 39% in the striatal infarct areas during this time. Nimodipine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), given 45 minutes before and again 8 and 16 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, did not alter infarct size at 6 hours but considerably improved outcome at later times. Edema formation was lower at 12 hours in the group treated with the calcium antagonist (p less than 0.05). By contrast, effects on local brain pH were seen as early as 6 hours after the vessel occlusion. Nimodipine greatly reduced the areas exhibiting the lowest pH values beyond pH 6.0 (p less than 0.05). Similar effects by nimodipine on brain pH were observed in the 12-hour series, whereas at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, a shift to more alkalotic values was noted with no overt differences between control and drug-treated groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91082134\r", 
  ".W": "An increase in the activity of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase has been shown to be associated with ischemia and other lesions of the nervous system. We have previously characterized the induction of ornithine decarboxylase in cerebral cortex following excitotoxin lesion of the nucleus basalis and have shown it to be sensitive to treatment with MK-801 up to 4 hours after the lesion and to be associated with an early increase in ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. In this study, we have used this model to investigate the effect of dihydropyridines on this response to lesion. Injection of 1 micrograms kainate into the nucleus basalis causes a large increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity that is maximal at 8 hours (292 pmol/mg/hr) when there is a 200-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity compared with unoperated control animals (1.4 pmol/mg/hr). Treatment of animals with nimodipine either 5 minutes before or 60 minutes after lesion did not affect the maximal ornithine decarboxylase response at 8 hours. However, repeated injections (four of nimodipine, 10 mg/kg) significantly (p less than 0.001) attenuated the response to lesion by 75%. Injections were given 5 minutes before lesion and at 1.0, 3.5, and 6.0 hours after lesion. The efficacy of this treatment regimen indicated that maintaining a blockade of dihydropyridine-sensitive channels over this period was necessary to attenuate this induction of ornithine decarboxylase. To investigate the critical period over which dihydropyridines might be effective, their action at the earlier time point of 4 hours was tested where a significant induction of ornithine decarboxylase occurs (60 pmol/mg/hr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four of the 27 patients died within the first 3 weeks and could not be evaluated. Of the remaining 23 patients, 11 were assigned to the nimodipine group and 12 to a control group. We analyzed data from positron emission tomography, performed twice before and after completion of therapy, and clinical data from the treatment period and the next 6 months based on the Mathew Score for early assessment and the Barthel Index for late assessment. During the post-treatment period, two patients from the nimodipine group and three from the control group died. The evaluated patients were comparable for age and sex distribution, initial clinical deficit, and infarct size and localization. We found significant metabolic changes between both treatment groups for contralateral infarct mirror region, ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral gray matter, and contralateral and ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres (side x region x treatment interaction p less than 0.025).

Beginning at 3 weeks of age, rats were fed high sodium chloride diets (8.0%) in combination with either high (2.0%) or low (0.2%) Ca2+ diets for 8 weeks. At 12 weeks of age, survival was 90% in the high Ca2+ group and 30% in the low Ca2+ group. The higher blood pressure and lower survival in the low Ca2+ group suggest an intensification of altered vascular muscle cell mechanisms by a dietary Ca2+ deficit. Nimodipine (1-10 nM) effectively blocked L-type Ca2+ currents in isolated vascular muscle cells from both groups. Contraction of isolated cells that were not patch clamped to high potassium solutions were also blocked by 1 nM nimodipine. Disappearance of the L-type Ca2+ channel current was accelerated by holding at depolarizing potentials (positive to -50 mV) and by depolarizing steps to 0 mV. Nimodipine block of the L-type Ca2+ currents in vascular muscle is believed to contribute substantially to antihypertensive properties and stroke prevention, actions that may develop fully only in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats on a diet of at least normal Ca2+.\r"

California cesarean section rates were examined to measure recent trends in obstetric practices and to project future patterns of cesarean section use. Using discharge abstracts from 1983 to 1987 California hospital deliveries, total cesarean section rates were found to increase from nearly 22% in 1983 to 25% in 1987, an increase of 15%. Using a series of least-squares regression models, time trends in the distribution of indications associated with cesarean section among all deliveries and indication-specific cesarean section rates were evaluated. Increases in the number of women with previous cesarean section and fetal distress contributed to rising cesarean section rates. In addition, indication-specific cesarean section rates increased for breech presentation and dystocia. These trends were counterbalanced, in part, by declining rates of repeat cesarean sections. Trends noted for July 1985 through 1987 did not differ substantially from those observed for January 1983 to June 1985, suggesting that recent policy attempts to alter cesarean section use have not had a measurable effect on existing trends. Projections suggest that California cesarean section rates will rise to a level of 34% by the year 2000.\r"

Of 257 respondents, 69% approved of the strike and 50% participated in it. Both strikers and nonstrikers agreed that quality of care and specific contract issues were important precipitants of the event. By logistic regression, factors independently associated with strike participation (P less than .05) included being unmarried, training in internal medicine or psychiatry, being in earlier stages of training, being assigned to an outpatient service at the time of the strike, holding a favorable view of physician activism, and perceiving nurses, faculty, peers, and the public to have favored the strike.

It is usually characterized by choreoathetoid dyskinesias in the orofacial, limb, and truncal regions, but subtypes of this syndrome may include tardive dystonia and tardive akathisia. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disorder are unproven, altered dopaminergic functions will likely play a role in any explanation of it. Tardive dyskinesia develops in 20% of neuroleptic-treated patients, but high-risk groups such as the elderly have substantially higher rates. Risk factors include age, female sex, affective disorders, and probably those without psychotic diagnoses, including patients receiving drugs with antidopaminergic activity for nausea or gastrointestinal dysfunction for extended periods. Total drug exposure is positively correlated with tardive dyskinesia risk. Management strategies include a careful evaluation of both the psychiatric and neurologic states, a broad differential diagnosis, and adjustment of neuroleptic agents to the lowest effective dose that controls psychosis and minimizes motor side effects. No drug therapy is uniformly safe and effective for treating this disorder. A favorable long-term outcome of improvement or resolution correlates with younger age, early detection, lower drug exposure, and duration of follow-up.\r"

Teaching principles of medical ethics within the context of jurisprudence and economics permitted the students to gain an understanding of the institutions and processes that act as positive and negative constraints on physicians' clinical and professional behavior. The course was offered during the fourth year following required clinical rotations so that all aspects of the course could be based on the clinical experiences of the students. It was presented in a continuing medical education format away from the normal teaching environment of first- and second-year classrooms and third-year clerkships. Finally, the course was designed by a multidisciplinary, multidepartmental planning group that included students.\r"

Atenolol alone was administered during weeks 1, 3, and 5. Naproxen or sulindac was administered with atenolol during week 2, with crossover during week 4. Data were analyzed for 27 of the patients (one dropped out after developing a skin rash). Naproxen significantly increased the systolic BP compared with placebo (mean 4.0 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1-7.0; p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in systolic BP during sulindac administration compared with placebo or naproxen. No significant effects on diastolic BP were observed. Weight was increased by naproxen and sulindac compared with placebo (mean 0.6-0.8 kg, p less than 0.05), although not to a clinically significant extent. One-week therapy with naproxen has a greater potential than sulindac to increase systolic BP in well-controlled hypertensive patients receiving atenolol; however, the increase is minor and unlikely to be of clinical significance.\r"

The values of 6-OHF and the ratio (713 +/- 250 micrograms/d and 0.323 +/- 0.242; mean +/- SD) before delivery were significantly higher than they were during early puerperium (395 +/- 145 micrograms/d and 0.114 +/- 0.055) and approximately three months after delivery (237 +/- 67 micrograms/d and 0.066 +/- 0.034). Although the values three months after delivery were comparable to those found in the nonpregnant group (n = 10; 228 +/- 48 micrograms/d and 0.081 +/- 0.031), 6-OHF values one week after delivery were significantly higher than those observed in the control group. These observations suggest that drug-metabolizing enzyme induction may occur during pregnancy.\r"

Of 241 initially screened individuals, 57 patients with TBC greater than 5.17 mmol/L (greater than 200 mg/dL) met the inclusion criteria of this six-month study. Of these, 51 completed the study. Outcome was determined by changes in TBC measured during the initial screening and after two follow-up visits. Pharmacist intervention included obtaining TBC concentrations and reporting the results to patients, teaching patients about the role of cholesterol in illness and health, explaining risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, and providing follow-up communication with patients. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and chi-square. The mean TBC was 5.84 mmol/L (225.7 mg/dL) for the study group and 4.23 mmol/L (163.8 mg/dL) for participants with TBC less than 5.17 mmol/L (less than 200 mg/dL (p less than 0.0001). There was a significant difference (p = 0.0124) in mean age for the study group (36.4 years) versus other participants (30.0 years) but no difference in distribution by gender (p = 0.18). ANOVA showed significant differences in TBC during the three visits (p less than 0.0001). There was a significant decrease in mean TBC concentrations between visits 1 and 2 and between visits 1 and 3 (p less than 0.0001), but no difference between visits 2 and 3 (p = 0.48). Compared with mean baseline values, 81.4 and 72.6 percent of the patients had a decline in TBC at visits 2 and 3, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Carbamazepine is extensively metabolized in the liver; however, there is little information available on its pharmacokinetics in patients following surgery or myocardial infarction, or in those with liver disease. We report a case of a patient who attained toxic carbamazepine serum concentrations (ranging from 18.2 to 21.5 micrograms/mL) two days after cardiothoracic surgery and an intraoperative myocardial infarction, and experienced lethargy, diplopia, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and horizontal and downgaze nystagmus. These alterations in serum carbamazepine concentration normalized ten days after surgery. They may have been due to a combination of changes in protein binding and decreased elimination due to altered intrinsic hepatic clearance. With carbamazepine achieving a more prominent place in anticonvulsant therapy, the influence of various procedures and disease processes on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of carbamazepine, as well as the clinical consequences of such changes, need further investigation.\r"

Interviewers volunteered no additional information, but questions asked by the pharmacist were answered according to a predetermined hypothetical case involving an 18-month-old infant with diarrhea and vomiting. Findings include the following: approximately one-third of the pharmacists recommended a product without caution and less than 20 percent inquired about fever, nausea, vomiting, diet, or the infant's condition.

Studies have investigated effectiveness, choice of drug, timing, duration, and appropriate route of administration. Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative endometritis in certain high-risk patients has been well documented. Factors identifying patients at high risk for endometritis include: indigent socioeconomic status, labor prior to cesarean section, rupture of chorioamniotic membranes, and number of vaginal examinations. Although many different antibiotics have been tested, no particular regimen has been found to be superior. Administration of antibiotics after cord clamping reduces the risk of fetal exposure without compromising maternal risk of endometritis. A single dose of ampicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin or cephalothin sodium) given intravenously provides adequate prophylaxis. No additional benefit has been demonstrated with the use of multiple-dose regimens.\r"

Cases have been reported in children, adults, and the elderly. The risk of developing mental status changes secondary to anticholinergic ophthalmic medications is of particular concern in the elderly. Drug-induced mental status or behavior changes should not be mistaken for exacerbation of an underlying disorder or the onset of a new disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, dementia). Clinicians should be aware of these potential complications, monitor for changes in mental status, and take appropriate action.\r"

Medical management, including dietary phosphorus restriction, administration of phosphate binding agents, and calcium and vitamin D sterol supplementation, must be instituted to control serum concentrations of these substances because of the loss of normal homeostatic mechanisms. If these measures are not employed, soft tissue calcification and hyperparathyroidism may result. We report the case of a 22-year-old woman with endstage renal disease treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis who developed secondary hyperparathyroidism and tumorous calcinosis as a result of noncompliance with dietary phosphorus restriction and phosphate-binding agent therapy. The etiology and treatment of soft tissue calcification in patients with renal disease are discussed. Compliance with dietary restrictions and phosphate binding agents is frequently problematic in this population. Pharmacists should play an active role in educating patients with renal disease on the consequences of noncompliance with dietary and drug therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91082530\r", 
  ".W": "Fluconazole is a fluorine-substituted, bis-triazole antifungal agent. Its mechanism of action, like that of other azoles, involves interruption of the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via binding to fungal cytochrome P-450 and subsequent disruption of fungal membranes. Activity against Aspergillus spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida spp., Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been demonstrated in several animal models. Fluconazole can be administered both orally and intravenously. Mean peak serum concentrations achieved in human volunteers after 50 and 100 mg (oral) are 3.1 and 7.0 mumols/L respectively. Protein binding is low (11 percent) and cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratio is 0.58 to 0.89. Serum half-life is long (22-32 hours) and elimination is via renal clearance of unchanged drug. Clinical trials and reports support the use of fluconazole in treatment of candidiasis, particularly oropharyngeal and esophageal infections in immunocompromised hosts. Fluconazole is also approved for initial and suppressive therapy of cryptococcal meningitis. Its role in management of systemic fungal infections will be further defined once results of other comparative trials become available. Fluconazole is well tolerated and its effects on steroidogenesis are markedly less than those of ketoconazole. Antipyrine clearance is not altered at low doses (50 mg) of fluconazole; however, drug interactions with the use of larger doses can be anticipated with agents such as cyclosporin, phenytoin, oral hypoglycemics, and warfarin. Rifampin appears to decrease metabolic clearance of fluconazole. Fluconazole is available as oral and parenteral formulations. Once-daily doses of 100-400 mg are recommended. Dosage reduction is advised for patients with impaired renal function.\r"

Aerosolization of sympathomimetics provides as great or greater bronchodilation in acute severe asthma with fewer systemic effects than parenteral therapy. Despite the broncho-selectivity achieved with this route of administration, cardiostimulation remains the major, dose-limiting factor in the safe use of sustained, high-dose therapy with these agents. This article reviews the pharmacology, adverse effects, and toxicities of selected beta agonists, as well as clinical studies relevant to the question posed in the title. Although the ideal study to answer this question has not yet been performed, the authors feel that available evidence supports the preferential use of selective beta 2 agonists in patients with acute, severe asthma who will require high doses of beta agonists.\r"

In order to determine the oral iron preparations patients in a Canadian urban center were receiving, a questionnaire was circulated to family physicians, internists, surgeons, and obstetrician-gynecologists to determine their prescribing practices. A survey of pharmacies in the city was also conducted to determine which brand of each iron salt (sulfate, gluconate, fumarate) they dispensed for a generic oral iron prescription. Most physicians (74 percent) chose ferrous sulfate as their drug of first choice. The majority of prescribers would not specifically request either enteric-coated/slow-release or nonenteric-coated preparations as first or second choices (71 and 64 percent, respectively). Enteric-coated or slow-release preparations were specified by 10 and 19 percent of physicians as first and second choices, respectively. Most pharmacies (96 percent) dispensed an enteric-coated preparation of ferrous sulfate for a generic prescription. We believe that many patients are receiving iron tablets with altered release properties (enteric-coated/slow-release). These tablets may fail to provide the desired therapeutic benefit based on the known physiology of iron absorption.\r"

Emphasis was placed on the quality of healthcare in the province and on the provision of information as a basis for education of the public and health professionals. Since 1978, 14 committee reports providing drug utilization statistics and specific recommendations for improving drug therapy have been distributed to Saskatchewan health professionals. The main focus has been on utilization studies of \"mood-modifying\" drugs (analgesics, minor and major tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, stimulants, and antidepressants). The JCDU initiated a program whereby drug profiles of certain patients were released to selected health professionals. Individuals who received daily doses in excess of JCDU guidelines for mood-modifying drugs over a three-month period were categorized as extreme users. Patient medication profiles of their drug use were forwarded on a quarterly basis to physicians who prescribed and the primary pharmacy that dispensed mood-modifying drugs to these patients. From the time of the first profiles (October-December 1979) until 1983, there was a 15 percent decrease in the number of extreme users. Between 1977 and 1985, there was a decrease in the percentage of the overall population receiving any prescriptions for these drugs (from 20 to 17.4 percent).\r"

The intercellular tight junction lies in and serves as the rate-limiting barrier in this paracellular pathway. Once viewed as static, it is now clear that the structure and permeability of the tight junction is highly dynamic. Not only may inflammatory events (cytokines, neutrophil transmigration) reversibly effect the tight junction but this key barrier also is regulated by physiologic events such as activation of absorptive cell Na(+)-nutrient cotransporters. Such physiologic regulation of the junction is of major importance to the absorption of nutrients via parcellular solvent drag.\r"

Here we report the distribution of MyoD1 protein, determined by reactivity with anti-MyoD1 polyclonal sera in normal tissues, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and in a variety of pediatric solid tumors. The distribution of MyoD1 protein was highly restricted in normal tissues and was detected only in fetal skeletal muscle and more faintly in adult skeletal muscle. All six human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines analyzed expressed MyoD1 mRNA transcripts as well as immunoreactive protein. The immunohistochemical expression of MyoD1 protein was then examined in 49 surgical specimens from a variety of pediatric solid tumors. Each of 16 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens was positive for MyoD1, including four that did not express the intermediate filament protein desmin. Two of five specimens originally designated sarcoma type indeterminate (STI) and two of three specimens originally designated extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EOE) were positive for MyoD1, suggesting commitment to myogenic differentiation. Three of eight Wilms' tumors, which also expressed desmin and had clearly evident myogenic elements, also were positive for MyoD1. Tumors that failed to express MyoD1 protein included neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, embryonal sarcoma of the liver, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma of the bone. These results indicate that expression of MyoD1 protein is highly restricted in normal human tissues and that expression of this gene product in malignant tissue may be diagnostic for rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore MyoD1 staining may be a valuable adjunct in the classification of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas.\r"

Five-year survival of node-negative patients with vimentin-positive tumors was significantly worse compared with vimentin-negative tumors (P less than 0.0001). In the node-negative group, only 36% of patients with vimentin-positive tumors but 82% of patients with vimentin-negative tumors survived 5 years. Tumors of all eight node-negative patients with ductal NOS cancer who died in the first 27 months expressed vimentin. Multivariate analysis of the node-negative group showed a strong correlation of vimentin expression and overall survival, but weak and not significant correlation between histologic grade or size and overall survival at 5 years. Thus vimentin expression seems to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis in node-negative ductal NOS breast carcinomas.\r"

Formalin-fixed and dewaxed sections from 23 cases of mammary (MPD) and 9 cases of extramammary (EPD) Paget's disease were immunohistochemically stained by means of the monoclonal antibody 3B5 directed against an intracellular domain of the neu gene protein. All MPDs exhibited a distinct membrane staining of tumor cells independent of the presence of ductal breast carcinomas found in 18 cases. All these breast carcinomas also were positive for neu staining. In contrast to MPD, all EPDs were negative. Normal epidermis was always negative. Northern blot analysis sustained the immunohistologic findings in that the presence of neu mRNA could be demonstrated in two of three cases with MPD. Negativity in one case was due to dilution effects by nontumor cells. Our results suggest that Paget cells of mammary and extramammary localization, although very similar phenotypically, derive from different genetic accidents. Furthermore neu positivity in all MPDs and all underlying ductal carcinomas suggests common genetic alterations for both tumors. However the finding of five neu protein-positive MPDs without associated ductal breast carcinomas may suggest a somewhat different transformation process.\r"

Lymphomagenesis in the SIV-infected monkeys was not related directly to the SIV-infectious dose given. All SIV-infected animals developed severe immunodeficiency. No significant difference in immunodeficiency was observed between tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing animals. In contrast, no lymphomas were observed in a comparable group of HIV-2-infected monkeys, which did not develop immunodeficiency; nor did the noninfected control monkeys. All 9 SIV-related tumors were high-grade B-cell lymphoblastic or pleomorphic lymphomas with extranodal, disseminated growth. Most tumors showed marked infiltration by monocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Occasional tumor infiltrating cells showed immunohistochemical reaction for SIV. The cells of two tumors were established in vitro and shown to be of B-cell phenotype. The tumor cell cultures showed no reverse transcriptase activity and no evidence of virus infection by electron microscopy. Our observations indicate that SIV-induced immunodeficiency in cynomolgus monkeys also mimics HIV infection and AIDS in humans with regard to increased lymphomagenesis and type of lymphomas.\r"

These results suggest that in nonendemic areas, a significant proportion of large cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cases are associated with human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I.\r"

  ".U": "91082912\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis is variably associated with tubulointerstitial damage, depending on the route and frequency of drug administration. Recently, different groups have shown this injurious tubulointerstitial process to be reversible, coinciding with the resolution of heavy proteinuria to normal values. The authors have previously shown that a single jugular intravenous administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) to male Munich-Wistar rats produces a triphasic pattern of glomerular injury and proteinuria, which culminates in focal glomerulosclerosis 70 weeks after drug administration. The authors now report the later progression of the tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities associated with acute nephrosis (phase I), despite spontaneous resolution of glomerular injury during the intermediate period (phase II) in this model. Although treatment of rats with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (50 mg/l drinking water) over the 70-week period did not affect the magnitude of proteinuria during the acute nephrotic phase, enalapril prevented the recurrence of proteinuria (phase III), as well as significantly reducing the severity of interstitial fibrosis, extent of tubular dilatation, and number of intratubular casts on semiquantitative scoring at the conclusion of the study. In addition, enalapril-treated rats had less low-molecular-weight protein excretion during the recurrent phase of proteinuria, suggesting a preservation of tubular functional capacity to reabsorb these proteins. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed only the glomerular visceral epithelial cell to be sensitive to PA, in contrast with rat tubular epithelium and other cellular controls. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism responsible for the development of the tubulointerstitial damage remains unknown, PA in vitro does not adversely affect rat tubular epithelium; there is however a clear correlation between the magnitude of recurrent proteinuria and the severity of tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities, as suggested by the beneficial effect of converting enzyme inhibition on both of these untoward processes.\r"

  ".W": "The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid.\r"

This was shown for actin, myosin, and alpha-actinin by immunoblotting as well as by immunoelectron microscopy. Tropomyosin was localized in mesangial cells by immunofluorescence. In cultured mesangial cells, actin, myosin, and alpha-actinin constitute a considerable amount of the total cellular protein contents. In mesangial cells in situ actin, myosin and alpha-actinin were found to be colocalized within conspicuous microfilament bundles that traverse the cell body or major processes in various directions and project into either the tonguelike pericapillary processes, which run toward mesangial angles, or into the microvilluslike lateral extensions that abut on the perimesangial portion of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Thereby, the GBM of opposing mesangial angles as well as of opposing portions of the perimesangial GBM are regularly interconnected by filament bundles within mesangial cells that contain actin, myosin, and alpha-actinin. The authors suggest that the major function of actin-, myosin-, and alpha-actinin-containing filament bundles in mesangial cells is to create an isometric tension (or minute isotonic contractions) to counteract the distending forces of the rather high intracapillary hydraulic pressure and its resulting pressure gradients across the capillary wall and across the perimesangial GBM.\r"

To test the effect of endogenous mediators from dying tissue on vascular leakage, the authors devised an experimental model simulating an infarct, whereby living vessels would be exposed to fragments of organs undergoing aseptic necrosis. Tissues from donor rats were implanted aseptically in the cremasteric sac. Control rats were implanted with materials deemed to be as close as possible to nonirritating: boiled tissues and spheres of Teflon or glass. At different points the rats were injected intravenously with carbon black and killed an hour later. Whole cremaster mounts showed that vascular labeling was strictly venular up to 8 hours, mixed with capillary labeling between 12 and 24 hours, and mainly or exclusively capillary at 48 hours. Histology showed an acute inflammatory infiltrate in the labeled areas. A similar but weaker labeling pattern accompanied by milder inflammation was seen in controls. These results indicate that the vascular leakage in aseptic inflammation is biphasic, first venular, then capillary; and that the capillary phase is induced by the inflammatory reaction itself, possibly through a form of diffuse angiogenesis.\r"

To attain a better understanding of the pathogenesis, the pathology and immunopathology of nine endomyocardial biopsies with active myocarditis from 18 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were systematically characterized. These were compared with 17 biopsies with active myocarditis from patients without AIDS risk factors. In both groups, the myocarditis consisted of either multifocal or interstitial infiltrates of small lymphocytes and isolated myocyte necrosis. The lymphocytes consisted of T cells (CD2+, CD3+) and cells not identified by the usual markers. B cells, monocytes, CD4+ cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were only rarely observed. All of the HIV-positive patients but only 7 of 17 non-HIV patients had CD8+ lymphocytes in the infiltrates (P less than 0.01). The arteriolar endothelium demonstrated induced class I (HLA-A, B, C) and II (HLA-DR) antigens in both groups. In situ hybridization for HIV-1 failed to identify the virus in the specimens. The immunopathology is consistent with a cell-mediated injury to the myocytes in HIV-positive patients and is similar to a subgroup of myocarditis in the non-HIV group.\r"

Increased expression of the 67-kd laminin receptor has been associated with the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells, particularly in colon and breast cancers. In this study, the expression of laminin receptor was evaluated using the immunoperoxidase technique in 81 breast aspirates (26 benign and 55 neoplastic lesions). Cells obtained from benign samples exhibited a low level of laminin receptor antigen detected by affinity-purified antibody raised against a cDNA-derived laminin receptor peptide. In contrast, 71% of smears obtained from malignant breast lesions contained cells that were strongly stained by the antibody. Heterogeneous expression of the laminin receptor was noted in both breast aspirates and fixed tissue specimens. These data suggest that the immunodetection of laminin receptor in cells obtained by fine-needle aspiration of breast lesions could be a valuable adjunct in the prognostic evaluation of breast lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The evolution of senile plaques and the relationships among neuritic elements, extracellular deposits of the beta-amyloid protein (beta/A4), and vascular beta/A4 are poorly understood. Immunocytochemical methods were used to examine fixed-frozen prefrontal cortices of 14 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (14 to 37 years of age) for the presence of abnormal fibers/neurites, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha-ACT), and beta/A4. Age-associated alterations included abnormal fibers/neurites, presence of beta/A4, and association of alpha-ACT with beta/A4 in plaques and blood vessels. Vascular amyloid was present only in the oldest monkeys. The topographic distribution of abnormal fibers/neurites was mapped with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, and deposits of amyloid were visualized with immunocytochemistry for beta/A4. beta/A4 often was associated with neurites, but many neurites lacked demonstrable beta/A4. Thus in aged monkeys, abnormal neurites may provide one type of focus for the accumulation of the amyloid precursor, which is subsequently abnormally processed to form beta/A4. Our data in rhesus monkeys suggest that fiber and neuritic abnormalities increase with age and that they may precede the majority of beta/A4 deposits; the initial stages of neurite formation and parenchymal amyloid deposits may be independent of the appearance of vascular amyloid; and these processes may be synergistic with advanced age.\r"

Synthesis of fibrinogen by megakaryocytes has been reported. To determine the relationship between plasma fibrinogen and alpha-granule fibrinogen in megakaryocytes and platelets, the fibrinogen content of these cells was studied in rats defibrinated by use of Ancrod, a thrombinlike enzyme purified from the venom of Agkistrodon rhodostoma. Unlike thrombin, Ancrod does not induce platelet secretion. Rats were injected with Ancrod (50 units/kilogram body weight) at 8-hour intervals for 5 days. There were no significant changes in platelet counts. Blood from the treated rats failed to clot, and plasma fibrinogen levels were less than 15 mg/dl. Bone marrow from defibrinated rats and untreated control rats was stained immunohistochemically for fibrinogen and two other alpha-granule proteins, albumin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), in plastic-embedded sections. The presence of these three proteins in platelets was detected by Western blots. Only trace amounts of fibrinogen were detected in megakaryocytes and platelets from defibrinated rats, but fibrinogen in control megakaryocytes and platelets was readily demonstrated. However defibrinated and control rats did not differ in albumin and PF4 content in megakaryocytes and platelets. It is concluded that a major portion of rat platelet fibrinogen is derived from plasma by endocytosis by megakaryocytes.\r"

Tissue viability (measured by adenosine triphosphate [ATP] concentration) decreased only 20% from 280 +/- 20 to 220 +/- 20 nmol/g wet weight. In veins prepared for culturing, endothelial loss (approximately 20%) was confined to near the cut edges. Cultured veins retained an endothelial layer in the initially undamaged areas, while the initially injured areas became covered by a mixture of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Autoradiography in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of proliferating cells on the intimal surface. Transverse sections of cultured veins showed the development of a new intima containing vascular smooth muscle cells identified by immunocytochemistry with anti-alpha-actin. There were also endothelial cells identified with Ulex europaeus lectin arranged in capillarylike structures. Pulse or continuous labeling of cultures with [3H]thymidine showed that proliferating cells were confined to the new intima and suggested that the smooth muscle cells in this layer arose from both immigration and proliferation. The results demonstrate that intimal proliferation occurs in organ culture of human saphenous veins.\r"

To determine the effects of IL-1b in the central nervous system (CNS), the rabbit retina was used, adjacent to which factors can be injected with minimal trauma and both pathologic and physiologic effects can be monitored. Intravitreal injection of 300 units of IL-1b induced an alteration in the visual evoked potentials (VEP) that was associated with marked intravascular red blood cell accumulations, hemorrhage, and cellular inflammation of the epiretinal vessels. Analysis of these events showed slowing and occasional hyper-excitability of the compound action potential of the optic tract and of the cortical VEP that correlate with the maximum inflammatory response. Histologic studies show the following: no apparent response occurs within the first 1.5 hours after intraocular challenge; and between 3 and 6 hours after injection an extensive intravascular red blood cell accumulation and progressive hemorrhage is accompanied by an increase in the number of mononuclear (MN) cells and the appearance of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. Polymorphonuclear cells continue to increase with time to give a single wave of inflammation that peaks 24 hours after injection, while the number of MN cells steadily increases. These events are associated with changes in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and correlate with the electrophysiologic dysfunctions. Forty-one hours after injection, MN inflammation, reactive gliosis, and residual PMN inflammation are evident. Neutralization with specific antibody inhibited the responses through 6 hours after injection. It is concluded that the rabbit retina provides a valuable model for the in vivo analysis of CNS inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined the hypothesis that senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are formed by abnormal leakage of amyloidogenic precursors from brain capillaries by quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between capillaries and amyloid plaques. Vibratome sections (40 mu) of the hippocampus, including the entorhinal cortex, obtained at autopsy from AD subjects, were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to beta-protein and counterstained with rabbit serum to either the glucose transporter protein, a cerebral endothelial marker, or collagen type IV, a basal lamina marker. The authors found that while 60% to 77% of amyloid plaques were associated with capillaries, only 8% to 13% were penetrated by a capillary, the remainder being adjacent. To test whether 1) the area occupied by amyloid plaques or 2) the border zone (10-mu rim) surrounding amyloid plaques has a statistically higher density of capillaries than 3) the remaining gray matter, similarly double-stained 6-mu sections from five AD subjects were photographed and the capillary densities in the three areas calculated. Capillary density was significantly lower in 1) than in 3) and higher in 2) than in 3), while the combined area of 1) and 2) showed the same capillary density as 3). Similar results were obtained by using either the glucose transporter or the collagen type IV antibodies. Because capillary density is low within, and high in regions that immediately surround amyloid plaques, our findings suggest that amyloid plaques exclude capillaries or lead to their degeneration, or both. The latter possibility was investigated by triple-staining tissue sections with antibodies to beta-protein, glucose transporter, and collagen type IV. The proportion of glucose transporter-negative capillaries was not significantly different in areas inside or outside of the plaques. Thus, the authors found no evidence of basal lamina remnants consistent with capillary degeneration preferential to amyloid plaques. Although a small number of capillaries showed amyloid deposition just beneath the basement membrane, the authors conclude that capillaries play only a limited direct role, if any, in amyloid plaque formation, and that the apparent association of amyloid plaques and capillaries is no more than a chance contact.\r"

The authors detected the absence of pan-T- or majority-T-cell antigens, or of both T-cell subset antigens, from T cells in the epidermis but not the dermis in 15 MF biopsies (8%) from 11 MF patients (9%), but in none of the inflammatory skin lesions. The opposite picture, characterized by lack of antigen expression by the dermal T cells only, was not seen in any of the MF or inflammatory lesions. The absence of antigen expression by epidermal but not dermal T cells, which the authors have termed antigen discordance, was most prevalent for CD5, CD7, and TCR-beta, each being discordant in 6% to 7% of MF cases or patients tested. Among the MF biopsies showing antigen discordance, 14 of 15 biospies (93%) from 10 of 11 patients (91%) were discordant for two or more antigens. Antigen discordance was not an artifact of treatment, because none of the patients showing discordance was receiving treatment at the time of their initial discordant biopsy. The discordance was the only immunophenotypic abnormality detected in 8 of 15 (53%) of the discordant MF biopsies. Thus, this antigen discordance was an important diagnostic feature that allowed the immunophenotypic distinction of MF from a variety of inflammatory skin lesions.\r"

Air drying induced an inflammatory response that resembled arteritis rather than atherosclerosis. There was medial damage, neutrophil but not macrophage infiltration, and fibrin formation, limited smooth muscle proliferation, which regressed after 3 months, and no lipid deposition. Within 1 week the smooth muscle cells were mainly of the secretory phenotype, and a neointima had formed. At 4 weeks the neointimal proliferation continued, but most cells showed a contractile phenotype. By 3 months, the lesion consisted of fibromuscular thickening with few small smooth muscle cells. Balloon injury induced minimal medial damage and continuing intimal proliferation with no evidence of regression by 3 months. It is concluded that air drying the carotid artery induces smooth muscle damage as well as endothelial cell loss, and this stimulates a wound-healing mechanism that is different from the response to selective intimal injury.\r"

  ".W": "The DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (DAV) causes a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible mouse strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis of DAV-induced demyelination, the authors investigated the spatial and chronologic relationship between virus (antigen and RNA), myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in DAV-infected mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and slot blot hybridization analyses. In spinal cord white matter, viral RNA was detected easily in ventral root entry zones 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Viral RNA increased to maximum levels by 4 weeks after infection, which was associated with inflammation and mild demyelination. At 8 to 12 weeks after infection, when demyelination became most extensive, viral RNA was significantly decreased. Demyelination did not chronologically or spatially parallel the presence of viral RNA within the spinal cord. Decrease of myelin-specific mRNAs, including myelin-basic protein and proteolipid protein mRNAs, was observed within the demyelinating lesions with or without detectable viral RNA. These results indicate that a viral infection of white matter in the early phase of the infection initiates spinal cord disease leading to demyelination, but later an ongoing immunopathologic process contributes to the presence of extensive demyelination.\r"

  ".W": "Glomerular proteinuria seems to be related, in part, to loss or impairment of the normal barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall. To investigate the functional properties of this barrier, endogenous albumin was revealed in the glomerular wall of proteinuric patients and compared with a nonproteinuric control by immunoelectron microscopy using the protein A-gold method. In the control biopsy, peaks of albumin accumulation were noted in the subendothelial area and in the inner portion of the lamina densa, with gradual tapering of the distribution toward the epithelial side of the basement membrane. The urinary space and epithelial cells were weakly labeled. In tissues from proteinuric patients, albumin was distributed throughout the entire width of the glomerular basement membrane, although the pattern of accumulation varied between patients. The urinary space showed significant labeling associated with some flocculent material. Mesangial areas were heavily labeled in tissues from both control and proteinuric patients. In the latter, lysozomes in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells also accumulated albumin, which is evidence of reabsorption. These results reveal the existence, in normal conditions, of a barrier located in the subendothelial area of the glomerular basement membrane, the loss of which, as in the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, leads to diffuse distribution of albumin in the glomerular capillary wall.\r"

  ".W": "Frozen tissue immunoreactivity with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear antigen in nonresting or proliferating cells, was compared to DNA flow cytometry results (from fresh tissue) in a diverse group of 60 soft-tissue lesions. Both DNA index and Ki-67 score were independently reported to be associated with grade and prognosis in sarcomas, but no direct comparison of these two variables was made. It was attempted to measure proliferative activity in fixed paraffin-embedded tissues immunohistochemically in a subset of lesions using an antibody to another nuclear proliferation antigen, p105. Lesions were given a grade according to lesion category (reactive, 1; benign, 2; low-grade malignant, 3; and high-grade malignant, 4). Ki-67 reactivity correlated relatively well with this grading system (r = 0.59); benign lesions usually exhibited a low Ki-67 score and malignant lesions usually but not always exhibited a high score. For example, some malignant fibrous histiocytomas contained only rare positive cells. Some disparity between Ki-67 score and grade and within histologic types indicates some independence from these features, a fact that may be important when correlation with prognosis is performed. However Ki-67 did not correlate well with flow data such as percentage S phase (r = 0.30), percentage S + G2M phases (r = 0.37), or DNA index (r = 0.39). This probably is due to the fact that Ki-67 also marks cells in the G1 phase, whereas these are excluded in flow data analyses. Anti-p105 highlighted almost all nuclei in all cases tested, including fibromatosis, and did not correlate with Ki-67 score, histologic grade or DNA flow cytometric data. Results with p105 could not be favorably affected by titration experiments. It is reasonable to conclude that the Ki-67 score is a variable related to but independent of histologic grade, histologic type, and DNA flow values. Whether it is prognostically important in human sarcomas, as has been suggested, awaits further clinicopathologic study.\r"

  ".U": "91082929\r", 
  ".W": "The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of pancreatic inflammation was examined in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model of obstructive pancreatitis. Pancreatic generation of PAF, as measured by bioassay (ie, platelet [3H]serotonin secretion), was determined at various times after induction of inflammation. Tissue levels of PAF in the normal pancreas averaged 600 +/- 49 pg/g, but PAF was not detectable during the initial 24 hours of pancreatitis, a time when the inflammatory reaction would be considered acute, that is, during the period of maximal serum amylase release and the development of interstitial edema. However a substantial increase in pancreatic PAF levels (12 times control levels) was observed 7 to 14 days after duct ligation during the late-phase response interval similar to the situation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in which parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency evolve. One week after duct ligation when PAF levels peaked, an evaluation was made of the effects of PAF antagonists (BN52021 and WEB2170) on pancreatic lesions using Evan's blue extravasation, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acid phosphatase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid. BN52021 or WEB2170 treatment was shown to reduce pancreatic damage and inflammation significantly. Long-term in vivo administration of exogenous PAF (20 micrograms/kg/hr for 7 days) exhibited a reduction of [3H]thymidine uptake into and amylase release from pancreatic acini in vitro. Our observations 1) that pancreatic PAF levels increased significantly during the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation; 2) that inhibition of the action of PAF, through specific receptor antagonism, caused an attenuation of pancreatic lesions; and 3) that chronic administration of PAF resulted in decreased pancreatic regeneration and exocrine function are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF as a late-phase inflammatory mediator in chronic pancreatitis in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is thought to play a role in modulating vascular cell function in vivo. In vitro, it decreases endothelial cell proliferation and migration. We postulated that these biologic activities could be mediated through TGF-beta 1 modulation of specific gene expression. Therefore we differentially screened a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with cDNAs prepared from both untreated and TGF-beta 1-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells. Using this technique, we isolated many TGF-beta 1-induced cDNA clones. Sequence analysis of these cDNAs showed that many of them corresponded to alternatively spliced fibronectin mRNAs. These fibronectin clones all contained the extradomain I (ED I) but three different forms of the type III connecting segment (IIICS). These different fibronectin cDNAs were expressed in bacteria and the recombinant proteins used to study the effects of IIICS alternative splicing on cell attachment, spreading, and migration in bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells and B16F10 melanoma cells. The results of these experiments show that attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells depend primarily on the presence of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sequence in the recombinant fibronectin proteins. However attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial cells are modulated by alternative splicing in the IIICS region. Specifically splicing of the IIICS region decreases spreading and increases migration rates of the endothelial cells. On the contrary, using a cell line (B16F10 melanoma cells) that is known not to require the RGDS sequence for adhesion confirmed previous findings that B16F10 melanoma cells do not require the presence of the RGDS sequence for attachment and spreading. Indeed B16F10 cells were able to attach and spread on two recombinant proteins that did not contain the RGDS sequence. However attachment and spreading of B16F10 were dramatically inhibited when a 75-base pair DNA fragment was removed from the 5' end of the IIICS region. These results suggest that various regions of the fibronectin molecule may be able to interact with different cell populations to promote cell attachment and spreading, and that alternative splicing may modulate this process.\r"

Progress recently was reported in the development of monolayer culture systems. The principal objective of this study was to develop a primary culture system for colorectal adenomas that would simulate three-dimensional in vivo growth. We used a calcium alginate encapsulation technique that was previously described for established tumor cell lines. Briefly, fresh resected specimens were washed, minced into small multicellular particles called microadenomas, and encapsulated in 1% calcium alginate pellets. The pellets were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C in humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Ten of eleven adenomas, including six tubular, three tubulovillous, and one villous have been successfully cultured for 34 to 162 days. Cell viability was confirmed histologically by light and electron microscopy. The cells were characterized as epithelial by morphologic features and ultrastructural studies, which showed a high degree of cellular differentiation, including villous brush borders and many desmosomes. Both tubular and villuslike structures have been observed in vitro, correlating in some cases with the histology of the parent adenoma. Measurements of proliferative activity by [3H]thymidine autoradiography or immunohistochemical staining with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 demonstrated growth fractions of 9% to 25%. A simple, highly efficient primary culture system was developed for the long-term maintenance of adenomas that promotes three-dimensional growth patterns and growth rates analogous to those seen in vivo. This model provides an opportunity to develop an experimental system for longitudinal studies of pathologic and molecular parameters in adenoma progression to carcinoma.\r"

Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition. The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives. These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future. She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types. Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, \"omens,\" and misperceptions. Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage. Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped. In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side. There may be considerable sadness. Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples.\r"

METHOD: The subjects were 32 stable elderly residents of a nursing home and 16 elderly residents of a chronic care hospital unit. Six raters administered the Folstein Mini-Mental State to 22 of these stable elderly subjects, and five raters administered the standardized version to 26 of these subjects. Each subject was tested on three different occasions 1 week apart. Each rater tested 4-6 subjects at the first and third weeks and 4-6 different subjects at the second week. The analytic technique used was one-way analysis of variance to estimate the interrater variance and the intrarater variance. RESULTS: The intrarater variance on all occasions was reduced by 86% and the interrater variance was reduced by 76% when the Standardized Mini-Mental State was used; the reductions in variance were significant (p less than 0.003). The intraclass correlation for the Mini-Mental State was 0.69; for the standardized version it was 0.90. It took less time to administer the Standardized Mini-Mental State than the Mini-Mental State. CONCLUSIONS: The Standardized Mini-Mental State had better reliability than the Mini-Mental State in this study group. Although the improved reliability of the Standardized Mini-Mental State was achieved by reducing measurement noise, this advantage would likely occur in a broad spectrum of patients.\r"

The test battery was completed by 16 research outpatients with borderline personality disorder, typified by behavioral dyscontrol and diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria and the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients. A comparison group of 16 normal volunteers also completed the test battery. RESULTS: The performance of the borderline patients was significantly impaired in comparison with that of the normal group on memory tests requiring uncued recall of complex, recently learned material. Cues given on an auditory memory task partially corrected that deficit. The patients' performance was also significantly impaired on several visual perceptual tests. These deficits do not appear to have been attributable to attentional problems, psychomotor impairment, current major depression, or history of alcohol abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The observed difficulties in separating essential from extraneous visual information and in recalling complex material may be relevant in understanding some of the clinical features of borderline personality disorder. The observed memory improvement resulting from cueing suggests specific strategies that may be used to aid patients' recall of complex material.\r"

METHOD: Twenty-one girls with attention deficit disorder and 20 normal comparison girls were consecutively ascertained from a pool of existing and new referrals from a pediatric psychopharmacology unit and a medical pediatric unit of the same urban hospital. First-degree relatives of the attention deficit disordered girls (N = 69) and of the normal girls (N = 71) were also assessed. Both groups of girls and their relatives were evaluated on the basis of structured diagnostic interviews conducted by raters who were blind to the clinical status of the probands. RESULTS: The relatives of the girls with attention deficit disorder had higher risks for attention deficit disorder, antisocial disorders, major depression, and anxiety disorders. The higher risk for attention deficit disorder could not be accounted for by gender or generation of relative, age of proband, social class, or family intactness. These findings are highly consistent with the findings in the authors' previous study of boys with attention deficit disorder, which was conducted with identical methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the validity of the diagnosis of attention deficit disorder in girls and suggests that the genders share a common biological substrate.\r"

Substance dependence was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, and the patients were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, Alcohol Use Inventory, MMPI, Health and Daily Living Form, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and measures of chemical use and life satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 100 substance abusers, 57 had personality disorders. These patients differed significantly from the 43 patients without personality disorders in several ways: they had greater involvement with illegal drugs, had different patterns of alcohol use, had greater psychopathology, were less satisfied with their lives, and were more impulsive, isolated, and depressed. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the marked differences between the substance abusers with and without personality disorders, a uniform approach to substance abuse treatment may be inadequate.\r"

The major aims of the present study were to determine if different standards for determining insanity produced different judgments and to provide a broad descriptive picture of those cases in which the standards appeared to make a difference. METHOD: Four forensic psychiatrists were asked to indicate whether they thought 164 defendants met any or all of four insanity tests: 1) the American Law Institute (ALI) cognitive criterion, 2) the ALI volitional criterion, 3) the APA test, and 4) the M'Naghten rule. RESULTS: The four psychiatrists determined that 97.5% of the defendants met the ALI volitional criterion, 73.9% met the APA criterion, 70.3% met the M'Naghten rule, and 69.5% met the ALI cognitive criterion. Nearly two-thirds of the defendants met all four insanity tests, and 24.4% met only the ALI volitional test. Few defendants met cognitive tests without also meeting the ALI volitional test. Elimination of the volitional test for insanity reduced the rate of psychiatric recommendations of acquittal by 24.4%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the fact that the primary logical division between volitional and cognitive standards appears to be powerful but that distinctions between types of cognitive standards are not terribly powerful. In addition, the variation among individual raters must be viewed as an important determinant of how any insanity standard is applied.\r"

To elucidate the reasons for this increase, this study was designed to assess the relative importance of various factors involved in the decision to commit a patient. METHOD: All psychiatrists in Ontario were sent a questionnaire asking them to make commitment decisions based on hypothetical case vignettes. Four factors were systematically varied in the vignettes: the patients' legal commitability, clinical treatability, alternative resources, and psychotic symptoms. Completed questionnaires, with three vignettes each, were returned by 495 respondents. RESULTS: All four variables were statistically significant in the expected direction; legal commitability (i.e., dangerousness to self and/or others, inability to care for self) and presence of psychotic symptoms accounted for the majority of the variance in the final decision to commit. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that psychiatrists in Ontario rely primarily on legally mandated factors (i.e., psychosis and dangerousness) in making their decisions to commit, although a considerable amount of individual variation is also evident.\r"

This number of symptoms was developed by committee consensus, and it is not clear whether patients with this specific number of symptoms can be differentiated from patients with lower but still substantial numbers of somatic symptoms. METHOD: Fifty-one percent of 767 high utilizers of two primary care clinics were identified as distressed by an elevated SCL anxiety, depression, or somatization scale score or by their primary care physician. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was completed on 119 distressed high utilizers who were randomly assigned to an intervention group in a controlled trial of psychiatric consultation. The 119 distressed high utilizers were separated into four categories according to the number of unexplained somatic symptoms found on the DIS and were compared on demographic, psychiatric distress, disability, medical, and health utilization variables. RESULTS: The data suggest that many clinical and behavioral features of somatization are significantly more common in patients with four to 12 medically unexplained somatic symptoms rather than changing dramatically at the diagnostic threshold for somatization disorder. The data also showed that patients who meet the DSM-III-R criteria for somatization disorder are severely ill and have a high burden of psychiatric illness and disability. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the DSM-IV somatoform disorders section should include somatization disorder, an abridged definition of somatization disorder often associated with anxiety and depression, as well as a type of somatization associated with an adjustment disorder.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: There is a controversial literature suggesting that stress, anxiety, and depression are harmful to the immune system and therefore to health. Preclinical studies indicate that activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by stress may be responsible for immunocompromise. The goal of this study was to assess this phenomenon in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHOD: Homosexual men in the community who did not meet modified Centers for Disease Control criteria for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were recruited for the study; 113 of the men were HIV positive and 77 were HIV negative. Very few of the men studied suffered from depression or anxiety disorder at the time of the first assessment. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol levels were obtained from the 112 HIV-positive and 75 HIV-negative men whose 24-hour urine volumes were 500 ml or more. Cortisol levels were correlated with measures of medical, immunological, neurological, and psychiatric status. RESULTS: Small but significant correlations between 24-hour urinary free cortisol and medical status, level of depression, and level of anxiety were found in the HIV-positive group. There was no relationship between cortisol level and the number of CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes or the CD4-CD8 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Although HPA activation may be associated with stress in cases of HIV infection, it does not seem to be associated with further loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Subjects with HIV infection with the most evidence of medical complications may also be the most anxious and depressed.\r"

METHOD: The families for the study were chosen from two outpatient clinics; the C. Henry Kempe, National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect provided access to families with incest, and the nonincest families each had a child seen in a university child psychiatry clinic. In each of these settings, 30 families were selected in the order of referral for evaluation. All families agreed to participate. Each family was given two tasks to perform during a structured interview. The interviews were videotaped, and 15-20-minute segments were rated independently by two of the authors, who used the Beavers-Timberlawn Family Evaluation Scale to assess interactional behaviors within each family. RESULTS: The incest families were significantly more dysfunctional in all but one area of family interaction. The distribution of power within a family did not differentiate the two types of families. CONCLUSIONS: The incest families dysfunctional patterns that seemed to support and maintain the incestuous behavior were a rigid family belief system, a dysfunctional parental coalition, parental neglect and emotional unavailability, and the inability to nurture autonomy in family members.\r"

METHOD: The subjects were 47 adolescents, 13-17 years old, who were institutionalized for periods of 1-13 weeks in a private mental hospital; 35 were girls and 12 were boys. Participants completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale and a child abuse and trauma questionnaire. The hospital records of 40 of the 47 adolescents were also available. RESULTS: Scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale correlated significantly with self-reported physical abuse or punishment, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and negative home atmosphere but not with abuse ratings made from hospital records. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the authors' previous work showing a relation between childhood stress and later dissociation in normal college students, these findings support the view that dissociation represents a reaction to early negative experience and places multiple personality disorder at the extreme end of a continuum of dissociative sequelae of childhood trauma. Researchers should continue to try to identify psychiatric patients with prominent dissociative characteristics or symptoms and attempt to correlate this phenomenology with negative earlier experiences.\r"

METHOD: The 947 patients were admitted to a tertiary-care military medical center. Each patient was interviewed, and abuse history, DSM-III-R diagnosis, and other characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported childhood abuse was 18% overall: 9% for sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse), 10% for physical abuse (with or without sexual abuse), and 3% for combined abuse. More female than male patients reported abuse. Alcohol use disorders were more common in victims of physical or combined abuse than in sexually abused or nonabused patients. Axis II diagnoses, particularly borderline personality disorder, were more frequent in abuse victims than in nonabused patients. Histories of drug and alcohol abuse were more common in patients reporting physical or combined abuse than in nonabused patients. Suicidality was also more frequent in abused than nonabused inpatients and was noted in 79% of the patients with histories of combined abuse. Combined abuse in women and physical abuse in men were associated with a family history of psychiatric illness, most commonly alcoholism in male relatives. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the need for greater attention to family dynamics, aggressive diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism within the family, and, especially, determination of patients' abuse histories, even if repeated questioning is necessary.\r"

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that survivors of the Nazi Holocaust would have significantly more and different sleep problems than depressed and healthy comparison subjects and that the severity of the survivors' problems would be correlated with length of time spent in a concentration camp. Forty-two survivors, 37 depressed patients, and 54 healthy subjects of about the same age, all living in the community, described their sleep patterns over the preceding month on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a self-rating instrument that inquires about quality, latency, duration, efficiency, and disturbances of sleep, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The survivors had significantly greater sleep impairment than the healthy comparison subjects, as measured by all subscales of the index, but had less impairment than the depressed patients except on the sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction subscales. However, for specific items within these subscales, survivors had significantly more frequent awakenings due to bad dreams and had less loss of enthusiasm than the depressed subjects. Sleep disturbances and frequency of nightmares were significantly and positively correlated with the duration of the survivors' internment in concentration camps. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that for some Holocaust survivors, impaired sleep and frequent nightmares are considerable problems even 45 years after liberation.\r"

METHOD: A group of 22 POWs and a group of 22 combat veteran survivors of the Korean conflict were compared on measures of problem solving, personality characteristics, mood states, and psychiatric clinical diagnoses by means of a battery of psychometric instruments and structured clinical interviews. RESULTS: Although the two groups were similar in background and personal characteristics, they differed in reports of life adjustment problems, complaints of physical distress, proficiency on cognitive tests, objectively measured personality characteristics, and assigned psychiatric diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Illustrated by a case report which describes the prolonged brutality of the Korean conflict POW experience for one individual, the results suggest that the psychiatric symptoms documented more than three decades ago have persisted in severity and chronicity. In addition to problems with cognitive deficits and complaints of bodily discomfort, most common among POW survivors were symptoms of suspiciousness, apprehension, confusion, isolation, detachment, and hostility.\r"

METHOD: Sixty subjects recruited through community organizations and newspaper advertisements and screened on the basis of history, physical examination, and laboratory studies were randomly assigned to one of three drug treatment groups. After 2 days of washout placebo, subjects were given 0.25 mg t.i.d. of alprazolam, 5 mg t.i.d. of buspirone, or placebo three times a day for a total of 14 days in a double-blind design. Behavioral assessments were completed beginning 1 hour after ingestion of medication on the second washout placebo day, day 1 of the treatment period, and day 14 of the treatment period. Tests included the continuous performance test, recall memory for word lists, digit-symbol substitution, retention of pictorial stimuli over 1 hour, the Profile of Mood States, and subjective ratings of mental status. RESULTS: Buspirone did not affect reaction time, vigilance, psychomotor speed, or memory function. Alprazolam had minimal effects on vigilance, psychomotor speed, and memory on the first treatment day and had no effects after repeated doses. CONCLUSIONS: Buspirone did not produce behavioral side effects that could lead to disability, and alprazolam had minimal side effects. Because the patients were carefully screened, it is unclear whether these medications in the doses used would have more side effects in less healthy elderly patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine if an acute dose of dextroamphetamine might have positive effects on affect and cognition in schizophrenic patients maintained on a regimen of haloperidol and, if so, what variables might predict such improvements. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized on a research ward received a single oral dose of dextroamphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. All patients were receiving 0.4 mg/kg per day of haloperidol. Cognitive tests, motor tests, global ratings, mood ratings, and videotape ratings were used to determine the effect of the coadministration of these drugs. Ventricle-brain ratios derived from CT scans were used to predict response to the coadministration of these drugs. RESULTS: Amphetamine improved performance on a measure of concept formation on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but did not result in changes in performance on tests of memory or attention. As a group, the patients were more active and performed psychomotor tests more quickly while receiving amphetamine. Six patients were judged by clinical raters to have improved in terms of affect, cooperation, and engagement with the environment. Improvement was associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles and increases in blink rate from the placebo to the active drug condition. No patient unequivocally worsened. CONCLUSIONS: These results may be consistent with the theory that coadministration of amphetamine and haloperidol produces relatively selective enhancement of cortical dopaminergic activity. However, because of the acute nature of the trial and the specialized research environment in which it was conducted, the authors do not advocate amphetamine as a routine clinical treatment of schizophrenia.\r"

Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this, but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age, sex, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes, neuroleptic drug doses, and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed, these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy.\r"

METHOD: The psychiatrists were members of the Christian Medical and Dental Society; questionnaires were sent to 260, and usable responses were received from 193. The subjects were asked about demographic and practice variables, \"born again\" religious experiences, group cohesion, and beliefs about using the Bible and prayer in treatment. RESULTS: The respondents were somewhat more religious than Americans overall, who are themselves more religious than most psychiatrists. Nearly all reported having been \"born again,\" after which they generally experienced a decrease in emotional distress. There was a significant difference in the respondents' affiliative feelings toward psychiatrists in the Christian Psychiatry movement and other psychiatrists. For acute schizophrenic or manic episodes, the respondents considered psychotropic medication the most effective treatment, but they rated the Bible and prayer more highly for suicidal intent, grief reaction, sociopathy, and alcoholism. Whether or not a patient was \"committed to Christian beliefs\" made a significant difference in whether the respondents would recommend prayer to the patient as treatment. About one-half said they would discourage strongly religious patients from an abortion, homosexual acts, or premarital sex, and about one-third said they would discourage other patients from these activities. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies have suggested a need for more sensitivity to religious issues by psychiatrists, and this study provides systematic findings on one approach. It remains important to evaluate ways in which a religious perspective can be related to clinical practice and what benefits and problems may derive from such a relationship.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Because previous studies of differences in utilization of mental health care services have had important limitations, it is not clear if their findings that health maintenance organization (HMO) outpatient mental health care costs less than fee-for-service care are due to less access, less intensive care per user, or selective enrollment of healthier people by HMOs. Therefore, the authors used data from the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study to examine differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorder and differences in the use of outpatient mental health services for adults enrolled in HMO or fee-for-service health insurance plans. METHOD: The subjects were an ECA community sample obtained from East Los Angeles and West Los Angeles. This sample included a large number of Hispanic subjects. The subjects were categorized according to their responses to a 5-item battery on insurance as Medicare enrolles, members of private fee-for-service plans, Medicaid enrollees, members of an HMO, and uninsured. The presence or absence of psychiatric disorders was determined by using the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Both users and nonusers of mental health services were studied. RESULTS: The HMO and fee-for-service plans had similar prevalence of psychiatric disorder and similar access to specialty mental health care. However, HMO enrollees had significantly fewer visits per user to providers of specialty care. CONCLUSIONS: The most likely explanation for lower mental health care costs in HMOs is a less intensive style of care for a comparably sick population.\r"

Overall, there were 670 total faculty in emergency medicine, of which 67 (10%) left their positions during 1988-38 to enter private practice, 18 to take another academic position, and 11 to do something unidentified. There was no difference in faculty attrition among the three specialties or in what the physicians left to do (P = .75). Both the orthopedists and the cardiologists worked more total hours each week (P = .001) but fewer night hours (P = .03) than the emergency physicians. Among the 67 emergency medicine programs, 28 reported no attrition; 39 reported one or more physicians leaving the program.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The emergency department of a busy public hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred eighty-two patients on whom the emergency physician ordered serum electrolytes. INTERVENTIONS: The predictive properties of ten clinical criteria were evaluated; these included poor oral intake, vomiting, chronic hypertension, taking a diuretic, recent seizure, muscle weakness, age of 65 years or more, alcoholism, abnormal mental status, and recent history of electrolyte abnormality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty patients (74.3%) had one or more electrolytes outside of the laboratory normal range, but only 143 (14.6%) had clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities. The clinical criteria predicted 135 of the clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities (sensitivity, 94.4%). When the eight \"false-negative\" cases were reviewed, none of the electrolyte abnormalities affected patient outcome. Implementation of the criteria would have avoided unnecessary testing in 233 patients (23.7%). CONCLUSION: Although no set of clinical criteria can eliminate the need for clinical judgment, use of a set of clinical criteria could substantially decrease electrolyte ordering without compromising patient care.\r"

We compared the outcome after SDE with that after high-dose epinephrine (HDE) in children with refractory cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Prospective intervention versus historic control groups. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Two similar groups of 20 consecutive patients each (median ages, 2.5 and 3 years) with witnessed cardiac arrest who remained in arrest after at least two SDEs (0.01 mg/kg). INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with an additional SDE versus HDE (0.2 mg/kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of return of spontaneous circulation and long-term survival were compared. Fourteen of the HDE group (70%) had return of spontaneous circulation, whereas none of the SDE group did (P less than .001). Eight children survived to discharge after HDE, and three were neurologically intact at follow-up. No significant toxicity from HDE was observed. CONCLUSION: HDE provided a higher return of spontaneous circulation rate and a better long-term outcome than SDE in our series of pediatric cardiac arrest. HDE may warrant incorporation into standard resuscitation protocols at an early enough point to prevent irreversible brain injury.\r"

DESIGN: Ten children from 2 months to 15 years old who underwent CPR had simultaneous pressure measurements recorded from the right atrium and jugular vein. RESULTS: The right atrium-jugular vein peak compression-phase gradient was 18.3 +/- 4.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), and the end-relaxation gradient was 0.7 +/- 0.6. Jugular vein pressure exceeded the right atrium only in the early-relaxation phase (right atrium-jugular vein = -2.1 +/- 1.2). Thoracic inlet venous valving persisted throughout the duration of CPR. CONCLUSION: There is a large venous gradient across the thoracic inlet during chest compressions in children, facilitating cerebral blood flow. This gradient reversed only in the early-relaxation phase. The data suggest that jugular venous return occurs only in the early-relaxation phase, whereas cerebral venous drainage persists throughout the CPR cycle.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded trial. SETTING: A university and community emergency department. PATIENTS: Sixty-three hemodynamically and neurologically stable children. INTERVENTION: Single dose of IM MPC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial respirations, heart rate, arterial systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Glasgow Coma Scale were measured at 30-minute intervals. Effectiveness was assessed by two independent observers using separate visual analog scales for cooperation and sedation. Times to sleep (27 +/- 24 minutes), sitting upright (103 +/- 87 minutes), ED discharge (4.7 +/- 2.4 hours), eating (11 +/- 7.9 hours), and normal behavior (19 +/- 15 hours) were acceptable. Minor, but statistically significant, changes in respiration rate (-1.9 +/- 0.4), heart rate (+4.5 +/- 1.8), oxygen saturation (-0.7 +/- 0.3%), and Glasgow Coma Scale (-2.5 +/- 0.6) occurred for 120 minutes after MPC. No serious complications or resuscitation were required. Mean visual analog scale scores were 5.0/10.4 or more in 71% of cases, with interobserver agreement very good (cooperation, r = .79; effectiveness, r = .80). Twenty-nine percent of children were judged insufficiently sedated. CONCLUSION: IM MPC is a safe and generally effective agent for ED procedures in selected children.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of selected symptoms of central nervous system infection, signs of meningeal irritation and/or elevated intracranial pressure, levels of CRP in serum, and total peripheral WBC counts among unselected pediatric patients undergoing lumbar punctures for evaluation of acute febrile illnesses. SETTING: Emergency department and acute care \"walk-in\" clinic of an urban, university-affiliated general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 160 previously well, acutely febrile infants and children (median age, 6 months). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial meningitis was 6%. Sensitivity of symptoms was 1.00 and specificity was 0.17. Sensitivity of signs was 0.70 and specificity was 0.81. Of the acute phase reactants, sensitivity of a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL was 0.80, while that of a total peripheral WBC count of more than 15,000/mm3 was 0.40. The presence of signs and/or a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of signs and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 71 of 150 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.47). Of 125 children without meningeal signs, the combination of symptoms and a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all three children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of these symptoms and/or a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 80 of 122 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.66). CONCLUSION: Quantitation of CRP but not the total peripheral WBC count can increase the sensitivity of physical examination findings and the specificity of symptoms for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Measurement of CRP in serum is useful as an adjunct to history and physical examination for the detection of acute bacterial meningitis in the acutely febrile child.\r"

Axillary and rectal temperatures were obtained with an electronic thermistor probe (Diatek 500), and tympanic membrane temperatures were obtained with a noncontact, infrared sensing device (First TEMP). Patients were stratified by age, ear canal patency, presence of otitis media, and rectal temperature. RESULTS: Of 224 patients enrolled, 87 (39%) were febrile. Overall correlation of axillary and tympanic membrane measurements to rectal for all strata was .75 (P = .001) and .81 (P = .001), respectively. Sensitivity in detecting fever for axillary and tympanic membrane sites was .48 and .55, respectively. Otitis media and ear patency did not influence correlation of tympanic membrane measurements. Low tympanic membrane temperature sensitivity may be a result of probe configuration. CONCLUSION: Tympanic membrane and axillary temperatures should be viewed with caution in children less than 3 years old as neither can detect fever reliably.\r"

MEASUREMENTS: Records were reviewed for historical, physical examination, laboratory, and pathologic features for all patients on their initial presentation to a physician and on final presentation during which the correct diagnosis was made. Using chi 2 analysis and Student's test, clinical features of misdiagnosed patients and patients diagnosed correctly were compared. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified with 50 initially misdiagnosed. On initial presentation, misdiagnosed patients were younger and more likely to have vomiting before pain onset, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, and signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infections. Misdiagnosed cases were less likely to have right lower quadrant tenderness and documentation of bowel sounds, peritoneal signs, and rectal examinations. On final presentation, misdiagnosed patients were more likely to have pain duration of more than two days, temperature of more than 38.3 C, and to appear lethargic and irritable (P less than .05 for all measurements). CONCLUSION: Clinical features of children with misdiagnosed appendicitis differ from those of children with appendicitis initially diagnosed correctly.\r"

We studied the effect of atropine administered in the usual doses as an adjunct to endotracheal intubation and for cardiac arrest to determine if it would interfere with neurological assessment. DESIGN: Two groups of children were studied. Group 1 consisted of 28 patients who received atropine (0.03 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) prior to endotracheal intubation. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients previously without evidence of brainstem disease who suffered a witnessed arrest and had prompt return of spontaneous circulation and received an atropine dose of 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg/kg. RESULTS: In group 1, pupillary size averaged 4.02 +/- 0.78 mm before and 4.75 mm +/- .84 mm after atropine (P less than .001). In group 2, the pupillary examination was conducted 30 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation. The pupillary diameter was 4.80 +/- 0.91 mm. All pupils were reactive to light in both groups.

We used a dog model to determine both a convenient method of measuring core temperature and the relative accuracy of the multiple sites. DESIGN: Prospective laboratory (animal model) study. SETTING: Operating suites in the Animal Care Department. PARTICIPANTS: Eight adult, anesthetized greyhound dogs. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous temperature monitoring by thermistors placed in the brain, central vein, tympanic membrane, bladder, rectum, esophagus, and subcutaneous tissue. Hemorrhage to 65% initial intravascular volume and autologous transfusion of cooled blood, during which serial temperature measurements were recorded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The readings were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Brain temperature correlated very well with tympanic membrane temperature throughout the course (r = .869, P less than .0005). Rectum, bladder, and esophagus also correlated well with brain. Central venous temperature, however, correlated poorly with temperatures at all other sites, reflecting the marked swings in intravascular temperature caused by cold transfusion. These wide variations were damped at the other sites. The best correlation of central venous temperature was with brain and bladder, although tympanic membrane correlation was fair. CONCLUSIONS: Because intravascular hypothermia appears to be the source of the arrhythmias and hemostatic abnormalities often seen during the early resuscitation of hypovolemic patients, our results suggest bladder or tympanic membrane as the initial temperature site. After the initial resuscitation, end organ (eg, brain) temperature is the most important and is most accurately reflected by tympanic membrane temperature.\r"

POPULATION: A convenience sample of emergency physicians, emergency nurses, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). METHODS: A survey instrument eliciting demographic and work-related factors was developed and administered; survey items included age, sex, occupation, years in occupation, number of procedures performed per week, number of contaminated needlestick (and other \"sharps\") injuries recalled, and number of these injuries formally reported during the previous five years. Nonsegmented visual analog scales were used to assess eight attitudes possibly associated with nonreporting. Analysis was by analysis of variance and multiple linear regression with stepwise variable election. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine subjects recalled 643 contaminated exposures during the five-year study period, but only 228 (35%) were formally reported. One or more injuries occurred in 55% of EMTs compared with 72% of nurses and 80% of physicians (P less than .05). Physicians recalled a mean of 3.8 contaminated exposures, whereas nurses recalled 2.8 and EMTs recalled only 1.8 (P less than .05). Physicians formally reported a mean of 0.26 exposures, whereas EMTs reported 0.85 and nurses reported 1.25 (P less than .05). Physicians formally reported only one eighth of their injuries compared with EMTs and nurses, who each reported two thirds of these events (P less than .05). Perception of risk, occupation, years in occupation, and concern about excessive paperwork were the most powerful predictors of low reporting rate (P less than .05). CONCLUSIONS: Work-related contaminated sharp object injuries are under-reported by emergency health care workers, especially emergency physicians.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Violence in the emergency department, a not uncommon but complex phenomenon, may become more serious when patients possess weapons. Searches are used frequently to reduce this danger, though guidelines for searches are not well delineated. We examined our practices in order to formalize our guidelines. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients found to be carrying weapons. SETTING: General, university-based emergency department in the Northwest. PARTICIPANTS: Of 39,000 patients seen during the 20-month study period, 500 (1.3%) were searched. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Of all patients seen in the ED, 92% were medical patients (153, 0.4% of whom were searched) and 8% were psychiatric patients (347, 11.1% of whom were searched). Weapons were found on 89 patients (0.2% of all ED patients and 17.8% of all patients searched). Review showed that 24 (15.7%) medical and 60 (17.3%) psychiatric patients carried weapons. CONCLUSION: Although various factors contributed to a clear bias toward searching psychiatric patients, we believe that the rate of weapons possession did not support this bias.\r"

  ".W": "Seizures in pregnancy pose risks for both the mother and the fetus and must be managed aggressively. Antiepileptic drugs have some teratogenic potential, but the risks are not as profound as reported in earlier literature. There is definitely less risk to the fetus from anticonvulsant exposure than from uncontrolled seizures. The evaluation of a pregnant woman with new-onset seizures is the same as for the nonpregnant patient, including head computed tomography with appropriate abdominal shielding. Status epilepticus management is based on IV benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. Good fetal outcome is dependent on rapid seizure control. Management of eclampsia is controversial. There is little evidence that magnesium sulfate has anticonvulsant properties, and its use as such will probably decline steadily in the future. At present, it is reasonable to manage eclamptic seizures in the same way that status epilepticus is managed.\r"

Undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism has a high mortality rate; thus, a high index of clinical suspicion and reliable diagnostic modalities are necessary to ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis. We report the case of a patient with severe central pulmonary embolism with a normal ventilation-perfusion scan. The embolus was identified by a nuclear pulmonary flow study using dynamic imaging, which obviated the need for contrast pulmonary angiography. The traditional ventilation-perfusion scan may appear normal despite severe central pulmonary embolism. In this situation, early dynamic imaging is necessary to detect severe obstruction of the central pulmonary arteries. This approach may obviate the need for contrast pulmonary angiography in hemodynamically stable patients.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective case finding using data for an 8-year period from the central registry for renal replacement therapy in The Netherlands. SETTING: Tertiary care hospitals with facilities for renal transplantation in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients who fulfilled at least four of the American Rheumatology Association's criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus and who received a renal transplant. MEASUREMENTS: Actuarial survival rates for grafts and patients after transplantation, maximal nonrenal scores on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, and time-adjusted disease exacerbation rates in all patients before and after transplantation. RESULTS: The actuarial graft survival rate at 1 year and 5 years was 68% (95% CI, 47% to 82%) and 54% (CI, 25% to 77%), respectively, whereas the actuarial patient survival rate was 87% (CI, 69% to 96%) at 1 and 5 years. High disease activity was not found to affect graft survival adversely before the start of renal replacement therapy or during dialysis. After transplantation, disease activity per patient and the overall incidence of disease exacerbations decreased. One case of recurrent lupus nephritis was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal failure are excellent candidates for renal transplantation; disease activity after transplantation is sporadic and low, and the recurrence of lupus nephritis is rare.\r"

Neither doubling of the dose of Pancrease nor addition of omeprazole to the lower dose of Pancrease significantly reduced fecal fat excretion (mean, 19.6% [range, 10% to 34%]; mean, 16.4% [range, 6% to 32%], respectively). However, addition of omeprazole to the higher dose of Pancrease (four capsules three times a day) significantly reduced fecal fat excretion when compared with the two doses of Pancrease alone (mean, 10.7%; range, 4% to 25%; P less than 0.01). We conclude that adjunct therapy with omeprazole reduces fecal fat excretion in cystic fibrosis provided that a high dose of Pancrease is supplied.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of arterial hypertension. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-two normotensive adults from a large employed population. METHODS: Echocardiography, standard blood tests, and 24-hour urine collection, at baseline and after an interval of 3 to 6 years (mean, 4.7 +/- 0.8 years). RESULTS: At follow-up, 15 subjects (11%; 7 men, 8 women) had a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg or both (mean, 143 +/- 7 and 87 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively). At baseline, subjects who developed hypertension had a greater left ventricular mass index than those who did not (92 +/- 25 compared with 77 +/- 19 g/m2 body surface area; P less than 0.005) and higher 24-hour urinary sodium/potassium excretion ratio (3.6 +/- 1.7 compared with 2.6 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.04); there were no differences in race, initial age, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, coronary risk factors, or plasma renin activity. The likelihood of developing hypertension rose from 3% in the lowest quartile of sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index to 24% in the highest quartile (P less than 0.005); a parallel trend was less regular for quartiles of the sodium/potassium excretion ratio (P less than 0.04). In multivariate analyses, follow-up systolic pressures in all subjects and in the 117 who remained normotensive were predicted by initial age, systolic blood pressure, black race, and sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index; final diastolic blood pressure was predicted by its initial value, plasma triglyceride levels, urinary sodium/potassium ratio, low renin activity, black race, and plasma glucose level. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic left ventricular mass in normotensive adults is directly related to the risk for developing subsequent hypertension. Left ventricular mass improves prediction of future systolic pressure, whereas diastolic pressure is more related to initial metabolic status. Black race is also an independent determinant of higher subsequent blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral corticosteroid therapy in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1966 to 1989) and a bibliographic review of all retrieved articles identified 33 original studies of oral corticosteroid use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease published since 1951. STUDY SELECTION: We submitted a photocopy of each study's \"methods\" section to three nonstudy physician-investigators who used nine explicit criteria to independently assess study quality. Ten studies met all criteria and five studies met some of the criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: To compare outcomes across all qualifying studies, we defined response to therapy as a 20% or greater increase in the baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); we defined the treatment effect size for each study as the proportion of patients who responded to corticosteroid therapy minus the proportion of patients who responded to placebo. Potential confounding variables as related to eligibility criteria and treatment protocols were also assessed for each study. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among ten studies that met all nine criteria, we found no significant differences in eligibility criteria, treatment protocol, or study design. No association was found between treatment effect size and publication date, study size, mean patient age, or FEV1. These studies had reported effect sizes ranging from 0% to 56%; we calculated a weighted mean effect size of 10% (95% CI, 2% to 18%). When studies meeting only some of the criteria were included in the calculation, the weighted mean effect size was 11% (95% CI, 4% to 18%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving oral corticosteroid therapy have a 20% or greater improvement in baseline FEV1 approximately 10% more often than similar patients receiving placebo.\r"

Cognitive problems are not resolved by a sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple possibilities and constraints until a satisfactory fit is achieved. The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain-behavior relationships that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone.

In 20 persons with unambiguous genetic test results or the subsequent phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease (chorea), there was a greater sensitivity of the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate metabolism (75%) relative to computed tomography (33%) or the clinical examination (17%) for the determination of a subpopulation of probable Huntington's disease gene carriers. Hypometabolism of the putamen and globus pallidus, and hypermetabolism of the precentral gyrus were also associated with a high probability of carrying the Huntington's disease gene. The findings support the hypothesis that abnormalities of cerebral metabolism precede clinical or structural (computed tomographic) abnormalities in gene-positive individuals at risk for Huntington's disease.\r"

Saccades made toward visual targets (visually-guided saccades) or away from them (antisaccades) were normal in both patients. Memory-guided saccades, made to the remembered position of a flash occurring 2 seconds before, were preserved in 1 patient and only slightly impaired in the other. However, sequences of two or three memory-guided saccades were severely impaired in both patients. It has previously been reported that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in programming sequential limb movements. Our data suggest that this area plays a similar role in the control of sequential eye movements.\r"

  ".W": "Four guanidino compounds that have been found to be markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of uremic patients, namely, guanidine, methylguanidine, creatinine, and guanidinosuccinic acid, were applied to mouse spinal cord neurons in primary dissociated cell culture to evaluate their effects on postsynaptic responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. Intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used. Guanidine, methylguanidine, creatine, and guanidinosuccinic acid reversibly and in a dose-dependent manner inhibited both GABA and glycine responses. Guanidinosuccinic acid was the most potent inhibitor of the amino acid responses, followed in decreasing potency by methylguanidine, guanidine, and creatinine. Guanidinosuccinic acid inhibited responses to GABA and glycine, at concentrations similar to those found in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of patients with terminal renal insufficiency. The other guanidino compounds tested exerted their effects only at concentrations higher than those found in uremic biological fluids and tissues. The inhibitory effect of guanidine and methylguanidine on responses to GABA was additive. The effect of the guanidino compounds on GABA responses was not antagonized by coapplication of the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist CGS 9896. The results suggest that guanidine, methylguanidine, creatinine, and guanidinosuccinic acid inhibited responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine by blocking the chloride channel. The observed action of the studied guanidino compounds might contribute to the pathogenesis of the complex neurological symptomatology encountered in uremia.\r"

All 4 patients had clear abnormalities of dystrophin, and were diagnosed as having Becker muscular dystrophy by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot examinations; that is, dystrophin of an abnormal molecular mass was visualized in muscle cryosections as \"patchy\" or discontinuous immunostaining at the surface membrane of the muscle fibers. One patient had a brother who showed widespread myopathic changes consistent with typical Becker muscular dystrophy. We conclude that the syndrome called quadriceps myopathy includes a group of forme fruste Becker muscular dystrophy.\r"

To determine its accuracy for detection of stenosing or occluding lesions, 133 consecutive patients were studied by both transcranial Doppler sonography and selective cerebral arteriography. Statistical analysis of findings was done separately for various arterial segments. High values for sensitivity and specificity were found for detecting obstruction of the carotid siphon and main stem of the middle cerebral artery. Diagnostic reliability of transcranial Doppler sonography was also confirmed by the calculation of a chance-corrected measure of agreement (kappa), which was close to + 1 in all subanalyses. Transcranial Doppler sonography seems to be a valuable tool for noninvasive detection of intracranial lesions of the middle cerebral artery and carotid siphon.\r"

The data from these three groups in a cross-sectional study were compared with results in our earlier study of 43 subjects enrolled with mild SDAT and followed longitudinally. We concluded that the cross-sectional method underestimates the severity of progression as indicated by some of the clinical measures. Additionally, the 24 new subjects with mild SDAT were assessed longitudinally. This replication study confirmed our earlier conclusions that four of six clinical measures showed similar patterns over time and were useful throughout the study, global measures being more informative than brief individual measures with ceiling or floor effects.\r"

Before treatment, the peak velocity of blink-related lid lowering and lid raising was slower than normal, yet lid saccades were normal. After botulinum treatment, significant decreases occurred in (1) the amplitude of blinks and lid saccades, and (2) the peak velocity of the blink down-phase. Botulinum treatment significantly alters blink lid-lowering kinematics, while saccadic lid-lowering kinematics are normal, providing further evidence that the orbicularis oculi muscle does not play a primary role in downward lid saccades.\r"

Direct measurements of intracellular pH, however, have thus far not been possible in clinical situations. We have studied the intracellular brain pH in 22 patients after head injury (mean Glasgow Coma Score 6.1). Patients were investigated by a combined approach of phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (overall examination time 50-75 min) at a mean time of 11 days after injury (36 hours to 24 days). 31P spectra were obtained in 11 patients on assisted ventilation and in 11 patients on spontaneous ventilation. These spectra were analyzed to yield the pH in the regions studied in all the patients. All pH values were in the normal or alkalotic range when compared with 6 age-matched normal controls. No differences were found between patients on assisted ventilation and patients on spontaneous ventilation. When analyzed as a group, the brain pH in the focal lesions appeared to increase in the first days, to reach a peak in the alkalotic range in the second week, and to return toward normal within 3 weeks from acute injury. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of posttraumatic intracellular brain acidosis in recent human head injury, and therefore, therapies aimed at alkalinizing brain cells need to be reconsidered.\r"

He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (PaCO2 62 mm Hg, PaO2 82 mm Hg), while consciousness was preserved until death. The infarct involved the reticular formation, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve, and sensory and corticospinal tracts. The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse). The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius. We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus is sufficient for generating loss of automatic respiration, while associated lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius may lead to more severe respiratory failure involving both automatic and voluntary responses.\r"

The motor-evoked potentials were reevaluated in 16 of the 53 patients after substantial reduction of antiepileptic drug doses. The objective was to assess the effect of epilepsy and of anticonvulsant medication on the central motor system. In subjects receiving antiepileptic treatment, cortical threshold intensities were markedly elevated and peripheral latencies were prolonged. Cortical threshold intensities and peripheral latencies decreased to approach control values after anticonvulsant medication was reduced but were increased in patients treated with 2 or 3 anticonvulsant agents instead of 1. Additionally, high levels of interictal epileptiform activity and a high frequency of seizures significantly decreased the central motor conduction time and, in part, threshold intensities. The central motor conduction time was further diminished after reduction of anticonvulsant treatment and increased when several drugs were administered. The duration of epilepsy, the location of the epileptic focus, and the type of the epileptic seizure did not affect motor-evoked potentials. Conclusively, central motor pathways are endogenously facilitated by epileptiform activity even if clinical signs of their involvement are absent. Anticonvulsant medication exerts major reversible effects on magnetic motor-evoked potentials.\r"

Advantages of this approach include (1) the elimination of levodopa plasma fluctuations and (2) the possibility of reducing the required dose due to constant plasma levels and because the gastrointestinal tract is circumvented. The peripheral implantation of polymer systems containing levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, or other anti-Parkinson agents may constitute a novel technology of drug delivery to improve the care of patients with Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".U": "91083462\r", 
  ".W": "Genetic influence on risk for alcoholism was examined in a US treatment sample of 50 monozygotic (MZ) and 64 dizygotic (DZ) male and 31 MZ and 24 DZ female same-sex twin pairs. For the DSM-III composite diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse and/or Dependence, statistically significant MZ/DZ differences in concordance were found with male, but not female, twins. For specific diagnoses, MZ/DZ differences were found in male subjects for both Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Dependence, while MZ/DZ differences in female subjects were found only for Alcohol Dependence. The male MZ/DZ concordance difference for composite diagnosis but not for Alcohol Dependence could be accounted for statistically by differences in age of onset between MZ and DZ probands. As with alcohol, differences in MZ/DZ concordance were found for DSM-III composite diagnoses of Other Substance Abuse and/or Dependence with male, but not female, twins. Using Epidemiological Catchment Area data to estimate the population base rates of both alcohol and other substance use disorders allowed for heritability analyses that showed genetic factors to have only a modest influence on overall risk in both sexes (heritability estimates of approximately 0.35 for male subjects and 0.24 for female subjects). However, evidence for heterogeneity in the pattern of inheritance was also found, suggesting forms of alcoholism that may be moderately to highly heritable.\r"

  ".W": "Suicide appears to cluster in families, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in this behavior. We studied 176 twin pairs in which one or both twins had committed suicide. Seven of the 62 monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for suicide compared with two of the 114 dizygotic twin pairs (11.3% vs 1.8%). The presence of psychiatric disorder in the twins and their families was examined in a subsample of 11 twin pairs, two of whom were concordant for suicide. Eleven of these 13 twin suicide victims had been treated for psychiatric disorder, as had eight of their nine surviving cotwins. In addition, twins in 10 pairs had other first- or second-degree relatives who had been treated for psychiatric disorder. Thus, these twin data suggest that genetic factors related to suicide may largely represent a genetic predisposition for the psychiatric disorders associated with suicide. However, they leave open the question of whether there may be an independent genetic component for suicide.\r"

This study was designed to investigate the relationship of dual diagnosis in opiate-addicted probands to family history of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders in biological relatives. Psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders were evaluated using direct interview and family history in a sample of 877 first-degree relatives of 201 opiate addicts and 360 relatives of 82 normal controls. Results indicate that (1) compared with relatives of normal subjects, opiate addicts' relatives had substantially higher rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and antisocial personality; (2) relatives of depressed opiate-addicted probands had elevated rates of major depression and anxiety disorders but not of other disorders, suggesting the validity of subtyping opiate addicts by the presence or absence of major depression; and (3) in contrast, relatives of antisocial opiate addicts had rates of disorders that were not significantly different from those of relatives of opiate addicts without antisocial personality. Implications of these findings for the classification and treatment of substance abuse are discussed.\r"

Overall, 55.7% met current and 73.5% met lifetime criteria for a psychiatric disorder other than a substance use disorder. In common with previous reports from clinical samples of cocaine abusers, these overall rates were largely accounted for by major depression, minor bipolar conditions (eg, hypomania, cyclothymic personality), anxiety disorders, antisocial personality, and history of childhood attention deficit disorder. Affective disorders and alcoholism usually followed the onset of drug abuse, while anxiety disorders, antisocial personality, and attention deficit disorder typically preceded drug abuse.\r"

Self-reported and/or observed anger, anxiety, craving, difficulty concentrating, hunger, impatience, and restlessness were the most prominent symptoms of tobacco withdrawal. These symptoms had returned to precessation levels by 1 month except increased weight, hunger, and craving continued for 6 months in many smokers. Nicotine gum decreased most symptoms, including craving and hunger but not weight. Abstinent smokers with more intense withdrawal were not more likely to relapse. Abstinent smokers who gained more weight were less likely to relapse.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of valproate, a drug originally developed as an antiepileptic, in 36 patients with acute manic episodes who had previously failed to respond to or to tolerate lithium carbonate. Treatment duration was 7 to 21 days, with no other psychotropic medications permitted except lorazepam up to 4 mg/d during the first 10 days of treatment. Serum valproate concentrations were measured three times weekly; an unblinded investigator then adjusted dosage to produce serum concentrations between 50 and 100 mg/L. Valproate proved superior to placebo in alleviating manic symptoms. The 17 patients randomized to active drug demonstrated a median 54% decrease in scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale as compared with a median 5.0% decrease among the 19 patients receiving placebo. On the 100-point Global Assessment Scale of overall psychiatric functioning, patients receiving valproate improved by a median of 20 points as compared with a zero-point change with placebo. Significant differences also emerged on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and in the number of supplemental doses of lorazepam required by the patients in each group. Substantial antimanic effects appeared within 1 to 4 days of achieving therapeutic serum valproate concentrations. Adverse effects were infrequent, with no adverse effect appearing significantly more frequently with valproate than with placebo. We conclude that valproate represents a useful new drug for the treatment of manic patients.\r"

Criteria of treatment effectiveness included the number of patients relapsing and time to relapse over a 95-day neuroleptic-free period during which either carbamazepine or placebo was administered. Relapse was determined by the concordance of psychiatric ratings and independent clinical judgements indicating significant worsening. Results for 27 patients (13 receiving carbamazepine and 14 receiving placebo) involved in the first phase of this treatment comparison were nondifferentiating. Corroborating descriptive findings in the second phase were available for 14 of these patients. There was no evidence supporting the existence of a treatment-relevant subgroup defined by episodic dyscontrol phenomena.\r"
