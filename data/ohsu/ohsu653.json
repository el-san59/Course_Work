X-ray mammography plays a key role in achieving the goal of early diagnosis inasmuch as mammography is currently the best proven imaging modality for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of mammography are summarized and radiographic features of breast cancer are outlined. Newer, more invasive methods used in conjunction with mammography are also discussed. It is hoped that the emphasis on practical considerations will enhance the understanding of the primary physician caring for women in order to increase the current under-utilization of mammography.\r"

Both goals can be achieved, partly through programs that stress both screening and early detection of some diseases, such as cancer, and decreasing the risk factors of others, such as hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. Efforts also need to be addressed at other common sources of disability and dysfunction like osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. Exercise is an important factor in such programs in order to extend active life expectancy and enhance vigor in later life. Habitual exercise is, however, one of the least prevalent of all the health promotion activities. A carefully designed exercise program that includes education about the reasons for exercise, as well as the proper methods of exercise, could considerably change the health profile of the individual patient and the increasing population over age 65 in this country.\r"

Of these, 274 were evaluated for admission to a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing portal-systemic shunts with distal splenorenal shunts. The criteria for inclusion were as follows: (i) a portohepatic pressure gradient greater than or equal to 12 mmHg; (ii) angiographic evidence of antegrade portal venous flow; (iii) angiographic demonstration that the inferior vena cava and portal, splenic and left renal veins were anatomically suitable for either a portal-systemic or distal splenorenal shunt, and (iv) the patient was a reasonable operative risk. Eighty-one patients from the six participating hospitals fulfilled the criteria and consented to participate. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to have portal-systemic shunt and 43 to have distal splenorenal shunt. After a follow-up period of 11 years (mean = 3.5 years for all patients), survival was found to be similar in the two groups of patients. The 30-day operative mortality was 13% for the portal-systemic shunt group and 9% for the distal splenorenal shunt patients. Late mortality was 55% for the portal-systemic shunt and 37% for the distal splenorenal shunt group. Total mortality was 68% for the portal-systemic shunt and 46% for the distal splenorenal shunt group. None of these differences is statistically significant. In those patients who survived greater than 30 days after surgery, recurrent variceal hemorrhage occurred in four (12%) in the portal-systemic shunt group compared to seven in the distal splenorenal shunt group (18%) (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this prospective, multicenter trial, 140 cirrhotic patients with no previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding and with esophageal varices endoscopically judged to be at high risk of hemorrhage were randomized to receive either sclerotherapy or conservative treatment for the prevention of first variceal bleeding. The end-points of the study were bleeding and death. Life table curves showed that prophylactic sclerotherapy significantly diminished the incidence of variceal hemorrhage (p less than 0.001) and overall mortality (p less than 0.01). Two-year cumulative bleeding rate was 18% in the sclerosis group (95% confidence interval = 10 and 31) and 57% (95% confidence interval = 40 and 72) in the control group. Two-year cumulative mortality rate was 30% (95% confidence interval = 19 and 45) in the sclerotherapy group and 56% (95% confidence interval = 39 and 72) in the controls. One patient died after hemorrhage from an ulcer secondary to sclerotherapy. Analysis by the Cox model of the factors potentially confounding or interacting with the effect of sclerotherapy suggested that sclerotherapy was more efficient in preventing first bleeding in patients with decompensated disease (Child B and C) than in those in good condition (Child A). However, the 2-year cumulative bleeding rate of untreated Child A patients was only 19%, showing how in this group the endoscopic findings were unreliable in selecting high-risk varices and explaining why after a 2-year follow-up prophylactic sclerosis did not show any benefit in such patients. We conclude that sclerotherapy can decrease the incidence of first variceal bleeding and death for a period of 2 years in cirrhotic patients with high-risk varices.\r"

Serum levels were elevated in all posttransplant patients irrespective of the presence of rejection. In contrast, biliary levels were significantly higher during episodes of acute rejection compared with posttransplant cholangitis (p less than 0.01), stable graft function (p less than 0.0001) and nontransplant samples (p less than 0.0001). When bile/serum ratios were studied, the difference between the rejection and the other groups was even more significant, and if a ratio of 0.2 was considered diagnostic of rejection, the test had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 87% with an accuracy of 90%. Therefore, these results suggest that the measurement of bile/serum ratios of beta 2-microglobulin following liver transplantation may be useful in diagnosing acute rejection. When bile/serum ratios of beta 2-microglobulin were compared with those for other proteins, there was strong evidence to suggest that local release accounted for most of the increased biliary beta 2-microglobulin during rejection. These results provide further evidence that HLA class 1 antigens on the biliary epithelium may be important in liver allograft rejection.\r"

Hepatocellular cancer was diagnosed in three patients (2%) after 66, 99 and 174 months of observation, respectively. The incidence of hepatocellular cancer was 1 per 350 patient-years of follow-up. All three patients with hepatocellular cancer had cirrhosis for at least 5 years. The frequency of neoplasm in patients with cirrhosis of at least 5 years' duration was 7%. The incidence of hepatocellular cancer in these patients with cirrhosis was 1 per 182 patient-years of follow-up, and the probability of tumor was 29% after 13 years. Late elevation of the serum alpha-fetoprotein level was associated with the presence of neoplasm but normal levels did not exclude the diagnosis. We conclude that patients with corticosteroid-treated severe autoimmune chronic active hepatitis are at risk for hepatocellular cancer. This risk is greatest in patients with cirrhosis for at least 5 years. Such patients are candidates for cancer surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocytes, as the major site of synthesis and terminal catabolism of plasma lipoproteins, exert the major regulatory influence on the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins in blood plasma and may thereby influence the rate of atherogenesis. The LDL receptor on the microvillous sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes mediates the catabolism of remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL. Binding of VLDL remnants to the receptor, mediated by apo E, is of very high affinity and presumably multivalent, whereas binding of LDL, mediated by apo B-100, is monovalent and of lower affinity, accounting for the much longer residence time of the latter in the blood. The magnitude of the influx of lipoprotein particles into hepatocytic endosomal compartments dwarfs that of other macromolecules undergoing receptor-mediated endocytosis and terminal catabolism in lysosomes of these cells. The intracellular compartments and processing steps in hepatocytic lipoprotein uptake and degradation are essentially the same as those described for other ligands in the liver and other cells. Receptors with bound lipoproteins migrate into coated pits which become coated vesicles. These vesicles uncoat and fuse to form CURL vesicles and tubules near the cell surface where most receptors are recycled, presumably via receptor-rich appendages that become separated from the vesicles. CURL vesicles become mature MVBs as they migrate to the Golgi/bile canalicular pole of hepatocytes, where they fuse with putative Golgi-derived primary lysosomes and are transformed into heterophagic secondary lysosomes. MVBs also contain a receptor-rich appendage that may recycle some receptors directly to the cell surface or through adjacent Golgi compartments. Dilated ends of trans-Golgi cisternae contain nascent VLDL undergoing packaging for secretion following their synthesis and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because these \"forming secretory vesicles\" resemble remnant-filled MVBs, occur in a similar location in the Golgi area of hepatocytes and coisolate in centrifugal fractions of liver homogenates, there has been considerable confusion about the identity of these compartments. With the aid of specific endocytic and exocytic markers, highly purified and morphologically intact endosomal and Golgi compartments can now be obtained from rat liver homogenates. The availability of these and similar fractions of defined purity should facilitate investigation of the hepatocytic processing of endocytosed and secreted macromolecules. Although chylomicron remnants are also taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, the nature of the hepatocytic remnant receptor remains elusive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the current study, long-term administration of a different vasopressin antagonist, d(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Me)VAVP, to SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) from 4 to 12 weeks of age significantly attenuated the development of systolic hypertension in SHR (p less than 0.05) without altering blood pressure in normotensive WKY.

From 206 U of blood transfusion requirement in the 3-month period before the study, only 34 U were needed after treatment. Serum iron and ferritin levels fell significantly during the study, and iron storage was considered to be one of the decisive factors in the response to r-HuEPO.

These results indicate that r-HuEPO is an excellent therapeutic aid for the anemia associated with chronic renal failure.\r"

Both PAN and PS exhibited high adsorption capacity for b2M. Osmolality changes had no effect on b2M adsorption or release. CR membrane adsorption was minimal but increased slightly when higher heparin doses were used. In experiments with CR and high heparin doses (4 U/ml) b2M release occurred during the first 15 minutes of in-vitro dialysis, but this increase was inhibited by removing the leukocytes from the blood, indicating that b2M is released from leukocytes.\r"

The physician must be aware of the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic in renal insufficiency as well as with intact renal function. Most antibiotics are eliminated via either hepatic or renal mechanisms, and the clinician should use this knowledge to select an antibiotic with the proper spectrum for the patient. This article presents practical guidelines for patients with hepatic insufficiency or various degrees of renal failure as well as for patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. The guidelines presented provide the clinician with an approach that is easy to use and remember for determining the appropriate dose and dosing interval in patients with impaired hepatic or renal dysfunction.\r"

Data were collected at the weekly team meetings. Statements of care givers were examined for evidence of their efforts to keep these promises and the times they failed at this task.

For the nurse, the concern regarding consent may be not whether the consent was informed, but rather whether the consent was freely given. The scarce resource about which the nurse is most concerned is not so much the organ as it is professional nursing care. For the nurse to address these ethical concerns, strategies will have to be implemented at the unit, institutional, and professional level.\r"

The problems and potentials of dual versus single-chamber pacemakers, are discussed, and subgroups of populations who may benefit from the different modes are suggested. Optimal programming of the pacemaker is cited as a necessary component for enhancing activity levels. Problems unique to patients with pacemakers such as myopotential inhibition, dislodgment during activity, and the pacemaker syndrome are also discussed. Finally, psychosocial considerations including education, emotional support, and the need to develop concrete activity guidelines are addressed.\r"

Radiologically, the femoral head had drifted and rotated laterally out of the surgically deepened acetabulum, causing persistent subluxation. Although there was no clinical evidence of sensory or motor denervation, sensory spinal evoked potential tests revealed the presence of neurological deficits in the majority of patients in this group.\r"

Expeditious approximation of adjacent skin grafts has long presented a problem to surgeons. Some surgeons simply place the grafts next to each other, relying on the intervening areas to \"scar in\". Others use staples to hold grafts together. These staples, however, can become buried under healed grafts and can cause \"foreign body\" reactions in the months and years ahead. In addition, staples cause bleeding beneath the newly placed grafts, contributing to hematoma formation. Still other surgeons suture or tape adjacent pieces of skin graft together, a tedious exercise. The cosmetic result of these techniques is often less than optimal resulting in the unfortunately familiar \"patchwork quilt\" appearance of grafts interweaved among scars. Vascular clips have proven to be useful for holding adjacent pieces of skin graft together.\r"

Water balancing refers to the control of the water mineral concentration so that the water does not damage the pool. Five major factors that influence water balance are pH, total alkalinity, calcium hardness, total dissolved solids, and temperature. The extent to which these five factors affect water balance can be computed by the Langelier saturation index.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the nature of androgen feedback mechanisms in normal men, we studied the hypothalamo-pituitary responses to administration of a potent, highly selective nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide HCl (1 g/day, orally, for 3 days). The impact of reversible blockade of endogenous androgen action was assessed in 11 normal men by analyzing quantitative alterations in specific pulsatile properties of LH secretion basally (hypothalamic regulation) and after 2 (n = 6) consecutive iv pulses of exogenous GnRH (pituitary responsiveness). Androgen blockade resulted in significant increases in 1) 12-h mean and integrated serum immunoactive LH concentrations (P = 0.01), 2) LH pulse frequency (P = 0.01), and 3) mean interpulse (valley) serum LH concentrations (P = 0.02) and maximal LH peak heights (P = 0.01). Additionally, there were significant decreases in LH interpulse interval (P = 0.02), LH peak duration (P = 0.02), and interpeak valley duration (P = 0.02). The augmented LH pulsatility reflected enhanced hypothalamic activity, since 1) pituitary secretory responses to exogenous GnRH pulses were not altered, and 2) multiple parameter deconvolution disclosed an increased number of computer-resolved LH secretory bursts generated per 12 h, with no changes in the apparent half-duration of LH secretory impulses or the calculated mass of LH released per secretory burst. We conclude that endogenous androgens act selectively to modulate the number of spontaneous LH secretory bursts in man.\r"

  ".W": "Chorionic tissue is one of the major extrarenal sites of renin production, and as such, cultured chorionic cells are a potential model for in vitro studies of renin biosynthesis and regulation. Human chorionic cells were isolated from four chorions and maintained in tissue culture for a total of eight subcultures. Total renin production was considerable in the primary cultures, but fell gradually with successive passages. The cells could be frozen and thawed without losing their ability to divide or produce renin. Both the primary cultures and the subcultures contained a single type of elongated cell containing abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils, but no renin granules, suggesting that the cells had smooth muscle-like features. Immunocytochemistry indicated that they contained both renin and prorenin. The renin produced by the chorionic cells was not stored within the cells, but was released rapidly into the medium. More than 95% of the renin produced was prorenin, which, after activation, had biochemical and immunological properties similar to those of pure human renin. The cells contained a renin mRNA that had the same size as that for renal renin (1.6 kilobases), confirming the synthesis of renin by these cells. The cells were also examined for the presence of other components of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensinogen and angiotensin I were not detected, but angiotensin-converting enzyme was present in extracts of primary and secondary cultured cells. beta hCG and progesterone were also found in the medium of primary culture. However, the production of beta hCG and progesterone fell after the primary culture, and beta hCG and progesterone were indetectable in secondary and tertiary cultures, respectively. These experiments suggest that these two hormones do not influence renin synthesis or vice versa. Thus, these cultures of human chorionic cells synthesized considerable quantities of prorenin and can provide a permanent source of nonrenal prorenin-producing cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that human decidua secretes a 34K insulin-like growth factor binding protein (34K IGF-BP) earlier designated placental protein 12, whereas placenta contains IGF receptors and IGF mRNA. We studied binding of [125I]IGF-I to paired placental and decidual tissues using competitive binding, gel filtration, RIA, and cross-linking techniques, and compared the binding characteristics of these two tissues which are located in close proximity in vivo. The effect of decidual cytosols on [125I]IGF-I binding to placental membranes also was studied. Consistent with previous data the dominating binding species in placental membranes were IGF receptors. In contrast, the binding of [125I]IGF-I to decidual membranes was mainly due to binding species with mol wts of 34K and 39K. The 34K IGF-BP was more readily detected in decidual cytosols than in decidual membranes and little was detected in placental cytosols. Purified 34K IGF-BP as well as decidual cytosols inhibited [125I]IGF-I binding to placental receptors. The inhibitory effect of decidual cytosol on IGF receptor binding was linearly correlated to the decidual content of 34K IGF-BP. The results suggest that the decidual 34K IGF-BP might act as a local modulator of the IGF action at the interface between the decidua and the placenta.\r"

  ".U": "89054325\r", 
  ".W": "Endemic cretinism occurs in areas of severe iodine deficiency and is manifested by two major clinical patterns, myxedematous and neurological. The relationship between these types and the factors responsible for the clinical variability are not clear. We examined 69 endemic cretins, aged 4-52 yr, categorized clinically at the beginning of the study into the three traditional types of endemic cretins, myxedematous (n = 25), neurological (n = 15), and the mixed form (n = 29), from a previously unreported endemia in Qinghai Province, China. These patients underwent detailed endocrine and neurological examination, including intelligence assessment using the Hiskey-Nebraska Test of Learning Aptitude or the Griffiths Mental Development Scales, audiometry (in a subset of 37 patients); thyroid function testing and thyroid ultrasonography; and radiology of the skull, hand, and hip. We found that categorization of the cretins into the conventional types did not reflect the pathophysiology of the condition, since an identical pattern and intensity of neurological, intellectual, and audiometric deficits were common to and equally present in all three types of endemic cretins regardless of their thyroid function. Gait disorder (in 99%) and pyramidal signs such as patellar hyper-reflexia (in 91%) were the most common neurological abnormalities. There was no difference in mean intelligence test scores among the three groups [overall mean intelligence score (Hiskey or Griffiths tests), 28.8 +/- 12.8 (SD)]. The differing clinical manifestations of cretinism could be explained by the length and severity of thyroid hormone deficiency. Myxedematous cretins were severely thyroid hormone deficient, and as a result sexually immature, dwarfed, and had retarded skeletal maturity. They had clinical and sonographic thyroid atrophy, rather than goiter. Although neurological cretins were euthyroid, linear growth arrest lines (demonstrated radiologically) in the long bones of these cretins suggested previous hypothyroidism. Furthermore, all cretins were growth retarded when compared with peers of similar age and race. Our data therefore suggest that the different clinical types of endemic cretinism are in fact the same disorder phenotypically modified by the length and severity of postnatal hypothyroidism. The neurological manifestations are interpreted as reflecting the effects of maternal and fetal hypothyroxinemia, secondary to severe iodine deficiency, on the developing nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "An immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for the direct measurement of the precursors of ACTH in unextracted human plasma has been developed and evaluated clinically in normal subjects and patients with disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The IRMA is based on an iodinated monoclonal antibody to ACTH and a monoclonal antibody to gamma MSH coupled to Sephacryl S300. The assay detects only peptides containing both epitopes, i.e. POMC (31K) and pro-ACTH (22K). The reference standard was partially purified POMC from culture medium of human corticotroph adenoma cells. The detection limit (greater than +2.5SD of the 0 standard) was 2.0 pmol/L and the within-assay coefficient of variation was less than 10% between 29 and 2600 pmol/L. Plasma concentrations of ACTH precursor peptides in 11 normal subjects sampled at 0930 h ranged from 5-34 pmol/L. The concentrations in the patient groups studied were: 260-2300 pmol/L in 5 patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome associated with small cell lung cancer, less than 2.0-104 pmol/L in 10 patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease, 23 pmol/L in a patient with Nelson's syndrome, and 3.0-230 pmol/L in 5 patients with Addison's disease. We conclude that this IRMA offers a simple and reliable method for measuring ACTH precursors in unextracted plasma. The proportionately greater elevation of ACTH precursors compared to ACTH in patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome associated with small cell lung cancer but not in pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, suggests that this assay may be clinically useful.\r"

The osteoblast-like cells had characteristic features of the osteoblast phenotype, including the presence of osteonectin, bone GLA protein, and type I collagen. The cells were able to mineralize matrix, their production of cAMP increased in response to PTH, and their alkaline phosphatase activity increased in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Immunocytochemical staining of the osteoblast-like cells with a monoclonal antibody against human red cell Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase demonstrated the presence of an epitope of the Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase in these cells; staining of paraffin-embedded osteoblast-like cell sections demonstrated anti-Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase staining only in cell plasma membranes. Western blot analysis of osteoblast-like cell homogenates showed that the monoclonal antibody to human erythrocyte Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase bound to a major band at 140,000 mol wt, similar to the mol wt of known plasma membrane Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPases. The presence in the osteoblast-like cells of a Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase similar to the human red cell calcium pump suggests that this enzyme may play a role in osteoblast intracellular calcium homeostasis.\r"

Staining was graded semiquantitatively on a scale of 0-3+ in bile ducts, hepatocytes, sinusoidal lining cells and vascular endothelium. Using the \"time zero\" biopsy specimens as a baseline for comparison, increased expression of beta 2m was seen in bile ducts, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells after transplantation. These changes were most pronounced in cases of rejection but also occurred in other graft conditions. The degree of hepatocyte and endothelial staining was significantly higher in cases of rejection and massive haemorrhagic necrosis than in the other categories. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis and diagnosis of rejection of the transplanted liver.\r"

(i) Tumours must be solitary and arise from the mucosal surface of the gall bladder; (ii) they must either be papillary or polypoid; (iii) they must either display junctional activity or have any other primary sites excluded by history taking, examination, and investigation. If these criteria are applied to the published case reports of primary malignant melanoma, only six cases, including the present one, can be regarded as true primary tumours.\r"

We suggest that the cerebral changes in the piglets and in the patient were caused by the shiga-like toxin elaborated by E coli 0157:H7.

F VII bound to triglyceride rich lipoproteins, the fixation being stronger on chylomicrons and VLDL fractions than on LDL fractions. In our experiments HDL did not bind to F VII. The fixation of coagulation factor X (FX) tested by the same method is comparable with that of F VII. The nature of this fixation seemed to arise from hydrophobic interaction as calcium was not necessary and the use of Tween 20 inhibited the interaction. The binding of factors VII and X was increased when lipids were previously treated by phospholipase C and the interaction seemed to be completely dependent on the lipid part of the lipoproteins. Hyrophobic fixation is a possible mechanism of interaction of plasma lipoproteins and F VII and X, and it may be of importance in the covariance of triglyceride concentrations and the activity of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy one patients underwent bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anaemia or haematological malignancy, 39 as allografts and 32 as autografts. All patients who were seronegative to cytomegalovirus received blood product support exclusively from seronegative community blood donors; seropositive patients received unscreened products. In no patients was there any attempt to reduce cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection by giving prophylaxis with immunoglobulin, and granulocyte transfusions were not given. The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection in the seronegative recipients (22 allograft, 15 autograft) was 0%; in the seropositive recipients 16 (63%) in allografts and 17 (18%) in autografts. These results suggest that provision of exclusively seronegative blood products is an important contribution for seronegative transplant recipients, but make little impact in autologous transplantation where the incidence of infection is low.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with follicular lymphoma presented with a high white cell count (45-220 x 10(9)/l) which resembled chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CCL): all had pronounced splenomegaly and, except one, generalised lymphadenopathy. The blood lymphocytes were small with scanty cytoplasm, densely condensed nuclear chromatin, and deep clefts originating in sharp angles from the nuclear surface. CLL cells are larger, have more cytoplasm, a different pattern of chromatin condensation, and may have shallow nuclear indentations or foldings rather than clefts. The circulating follicular lymphoma cells had moderate to strong membrane immunoglobulins (SmIg), low mouse (M)-rosettes, strong reactivity with the monoclonal antibody FMC7, and occasional expression of the CD5-antigen; at least one third of cells in each case were positive with anti-cALLa (J5,CD10). Half the cases were referred as B-CLL but none had the typical B-CLL immunophenotype: weak SmIg, M-rosettes of greater than 50%, CD5 positive, FMC7 and J5 negative. The diagnosis of follicular lymphoma was confirmed by lymph node biopsy in seven of the 10 cases. The overall response to treatment was poor and five patients died within three years of diagnosis. This aggressive form of follicular lymphoma needs to be distinguished from B-CLL as different management is required.\r"

By immunoblotting experiments, Mac 387 was shown to react with a previously defined antigen called L1; this is a multichain myelomoncytic protein of about 36 Kd which shows sequence homology with the cystic fibrosis antigen. The L1 protein is present in the cytoplasm of virtually all resting peripheral neutrophils and monocytes; it is also variably expressed on the plasma membrane of these cells, possibly as a secretory product. Because the L1 antigen is resistant to denaturation by formalin, its tissue distribution can be studied in routinely processed biopsy material. In a wide variety of specimens Mac 387 was shown by immunohistochemical analysis, to produce a cytoplasmic staining pattern concordant with that of a well defined polyclonal antibody to the L1 antigen. Cytoplasmic reactivity was obtained with granulocytes and infiltrating macrophages but generally not with several categories of dendritic cells. In addition, squamous epithelium of mucous membranes was strongly positive, in contrast to normal epidermis.\r"

The disease has multiple systemic associations that include involvement of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems as well as the joints, blood vessels, and lungs. Infrequently observed in the Americas and Western Europe, it has been more commonly seen in Turkey and Japan. Human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-Bw51, HLA-B27, and HLA-B12 have each been associated with various manifestations of Behcet's disease. Numerous etiologies have been proposed, including environmental, virologic, bacterial, and immunologic factors; an autoimmune basis, characterized by circulating immune complexes and complement activation, has gained increasing acceptance. Although tetracycline remains the drug of choice for the oral ulcers of Behcet's disease, topical corticosteroids and topical anesthetics have been used for both oral and genital involvement. Oral corticosteroids continue to be the mainstay of systemic therapy, although various immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, colchicine, dapsone, and cyclosporine, have been employed successfully.\r"

Spontaneous resolution in both patients suggests that the condition is reactive. We propose the term mucosal melanotic macule, reactive type, for this lesion, which has been described previously under the misnomer oral melanoacanthoma.\r"

  ".W": "Linear IgA disease of adults, chronic bullous disease of childhood, and the rare childhood cicatricial pemphigoid currently are regarded as separate clinical entities despite their many shared features. All are sulfone-responsive subepidermal bullous diseases associated with linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone. In this paper we present a long-term study of 25 cases of adult linear IgA disease, 25 cases of chronic bullous disease of childhood, and four cases of childhood cicatricial pemphigoid, which has revealed further similarities among all three groups. The morphology and distribution of the cutaneous and mucosal lesions were similar; mucosal involvement was present in 80% of patients with adult linear IgA disease, 64% of those with chronic bullous disease of childhood, and 100% of those with childhood cicatricial pemphigoid, and ocular scarring affected patients in all groups. Remission occurred in 64% of those with chronic bullous disease of childhood (the disease was active in 12% after puberty), 48% of those with adult linear IgA disease, and in no cases of childhood cicatricial pemphigoid. HLA B8 and circulating IgA anti-basement membrane zone antibody were more common in chronic bullous disease of childhood than adult linear IgA disease. There were no absolute differences among the three groups, and we suggest that adult linear IgA disease, chronic bullous disease of childhood, and childhood cicatricial pemphigoid are the same disease, with childhood cicatricial pemphigoid being a more severe form of chronic bullous disease of childhood.\r"

From a quality of care perspective, the increased use of pharmacist assistants, the tendency toward generic and therapeutic drug substitution, and the less specialized clinical education of pharmacists all pose hazards rather than safety checks upon physician prescribing. There is no evidence that pharmacists charge less than physicians. If they did, there would be no need to protect their incomes legislatively by restricting physician dispensing. Economic motivation per se is less important to a physician than providing a true convenience for his patients and thus encouraging a closer doctor-patient relationship. Physician dispensing adds to the availability of medication and may minimize the number of patients shuttling between pharmacies to obtain complex multi-ingredient preparations. Compliance is enhanced as availability increases. Prepackaged pharmaceuticals prepared under the auspices of pharmacists and dispensed by physicians are at least as safe as those prepared by the ungloved hands of a pharmacist hidden behind store counters. Thus, restricting the physician's right to dispense can negatively affect the quality of medical care, the cost of medications, safety, the availability of pharmaceuticals, and patient compliance. Such limitation is certainly not in the best interest of our patients.\r"

Her case ultimately was controlled with cyclosporine after the failure of a variety of therapeutic modalities in the hospital, including prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine, phenytoin, vitamin E, gold sodium thiomalate (Myochrysine), isotretinoin, and plasmapheresis. In contrast to patients with pemphigus and pemphigoid treated with cyclosporine, our patient's autoantibodies did not disappear on therapy. Although its mechanism of action in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is unknown, we propose that cyclosporine may be a helpful drug for patients whose disease is refractory to more traditional forms of therapy.\r"

The presence of epidermal Langerhans cells, known to be antigen-presenting cells, was required for nevus cell-specific activation of the patient's T lymphocytes. Antibody-independent inhibition of melanoma cell growth was detected by the use of the patient's mononuclear cells.

Nine of the 10 patients had congestive heart failure at presentation (mean age 2 days). A cranial bruit was heard in three and arteriovenous fistula was suspected in five patients. Aortic arch segments and brachiocephalic vessel dimensions expressed as ratios of the abdominal aorta showed significantly larger values in patients for the ascending aorta (p = 0.01), innominate artery (p less than 0.001), right and left subclavian arteries (p less than 0.001) and left common carotid artery (p less than 0.05). The thoracic descending aorta was, however, significantly smaller in patients (p less than 0.002). Retrograde diastolic Doppler flow in the descending aorta proximal to the ductus arteriosus and anterograde diastolic flow with a mean spectral flow-time integral 27% of systolic were present in patients only, whereas Doppler diastolic flow in brachiocephalic vessels, present in 5 of 29 control infants, was less than 15% of systolic flow and not accompanied by dilation of these vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Doubly committed subarterial (supracristal, subpulmonary) ventricular septal defects are often complicated by aortic regurgitation resulting from aortic valve herniation into the defect. The clinical, echocardiographic and catheterization findings in 48 patients aged 0.3 to 46.4 years (median 9.5) with a doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defect were reviewed. Aortic valve herniation was present in 38 (79%) and 55% of these had aortic regurgitation. The prevalence of both findings increased gradually with advancing age. The defect was closed surgically in 41 patients. Surgery during the first 2 years of life (median 0.4 year) was performed in 13 patients (group I), mainly because of a large shunt with a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) 3.8 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD). Aortic regurgitation was present preoperatively in two patients (15%), persisted postoperatively in one patient and did not develop in any after repair (median duration of follow-up 2.3 years, range 0.1 to 7.4). In the other 28 patients (group II) surgery was performed between 4.8 and 46.4 years of age (median 11.5). These patients were generally less symptomatic and had a smaller shunt (Qp/Qs 1.5 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001). Preoperative aortic regurgitation was present in 18 (64%). It persisted in 15 postoperatively, but in 13 of these it had diminished. Two-dimensional echocardiography in multiple views identified the site of the ventricular septal defect in all patients. Serial echocardiographic examinations demonstrated the progressive nature of aortic valve herniation, the partial occlusion of the defect by the herniated sinus and the development of aortic regurgitation. These findings suggest that timely surgical closure of these defects may prevent aortic regurgitation.\r"

All patients started with a 2 week placebo period followed by a random assignment to either drug treatment for 3 weeks and subsequent crossover to the other treatment. The two drug treatment periods were separated by a 1 week placebo washout phase and the study was completed with a 1 week placebo phase. There were no significant differences between patients' responses to diltiazem and nifedipine in relation to time to onset of angina, ST depression responses to exercise, heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A total of 37 adverse effects were reported with nifedipine compared with 9 with diltiazem in the 22 patients in whom drug safety was analyzed. Additionally, two patients treated with nifedipine were withdrawn from study participation before crossover. There was a significant (p less than 0.05) difference with respect to incidence of edema (7 of 22 patients taking nifedipine, 1 of 22 taking diltiazem) and dizziness (7 of 22 patients taking nifedipine, 0 of 22 taking diltiazem). The most frequent adverse effect reported with diltiazem was rash (3 of 22 patients). Severe adverse effects were reported in four patients: in one with diltiazem (rash) and in three with nifedipine (palpitation in two and headache in one). A reduction in prescribed dosage was required in 37% of nifedipine-treated compared with 6% of diltiazem-treated patients. Efficacy measures were significantly improved above placebo levels by both diltiazem and nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A number of reperfusion methods have been used to achieve vessel patency in acute myocardial infarction, but each strategy varies considerably in its risk to the patient. Intravenous thrombolysis is associated with an 8% risk of major or minor bleeding and a less than 0.5% risk of intracranial bleeding. This latter risk has been reported to be 1.5% when 150 rather than 100 mg of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used. Invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and intraaortic balloon pumping significantly increased the risk of major bleeding at the vascular entry site (from 20 to 40%). Clinical factors such as older age, female gender, lower body weight and hematologic variables including nadir fibrinogen levels and fibrin degradation products also relate to an increased risk. Coronary angioplasty performed alone without thrombolysis is not associated with an excess risk of bleeding and appears to have complications similar to those reported for angioplasty in patients undergoing elective procedures. Systemic anticoagulation has a low (less than 2%) incidence of bleeding, and serious bleeding is rare. These risks must be considered in the decision to institute a treatment strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "A computer model was developed to analyze the costs to Medicare and the potential procedure volume associated with alternative strategies for treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The expected cost per case to Medicare for initial hospitalization was approximately $7,200 for conventional treatment, $7,900 for treatment with intravenous streptokinase and $8,400 for treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). The expected cost per case for use of streptokinase or rt-PA in combination with cardiac catheterization performed either emergently or at 48 h was in excess of $11,000. These cost estimates do not reflect the cost of thrombolytic drugs themselves because Medicare has not adjusted its hospital payment rates to take account of such costs. Although both streptokinase and rt-PA will increase costs to Medicare for hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, both agents will do so at a reasonably low cost per additional life saved--between $50,000 and $60,000. Emergency and 48 h catheterization strategies are considerably less cost-effective. Regarding procedures, this model suggests that for every 1,000 patients treatment with streptokinase will result in an additional 76 coronary angioplasty procedures and 26 coronary artery bypass operations, whereas treatment with rt-PA will result in an additional 122 angioplasty procedures and 43 bypass operations compared with conventional treatment. Thrombolytic treatment is thus likely to increase substantially the volume of cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "Management of unstable angina has evolved progressively, and coronary angioplasty has recently been shown to be an effective treatment strategy for unstable angina. However, the procedure-related major complication rate is higher when compared with that for angioplasty in stable angina. The underlying pathophysiology may explain this higher complication rate. Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque associated with thrombus formation is frequent in the pathogenesis of unstable angina. These processes lead to a critical reduction in myocardial blood supply, and coronary angioplasty may effectively interrupt this process. In contrast, coronary angioplasty itself may cause further injury of the already ulcerated intima, have the potential to intensify the ongoing thrombogenic process and lead to an increased frequency of abrupt closure of the artery during the procedure. Therefore, intracoronary streptokinase was used in the procedure in those patients with abrupt closure of the artery immediately after dilation to attempt to improve the immediate result. Coronary angioplasty was attempted in 200 consecutive patients with unstable angina. Initial success in crossing the obstructed artery was achieved in 196 patients; however, an abrupt closure immediately after dilation occurred in 21 of these patients. Of these 21 patients, 12 were also treated with intracoronary streptokinase, and successful dilation was achieved in 9 patients without evidence of necrosis or the need for emergency bypass surgery. Of the remaining nine patients, four successfully underwent redilation with a larger-sized balloon, four underwent urgent surgery (one death postoperatively) and one was treated conventionally. Final success was achieved in 188 patients (94%) without death, the need for emergency surgery or evidence of myocardial necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No specific IgE was detected in cockroach-negative atopic and nonatopic subjects. Bronchial provocation test with cockroach antigen was performed on 15 subjects. Immediate asthmatic response was detected in six of nine cockroach-positive subjects with asthma. Two cockroach-negative subjects with asthma and four nonatopic subjects demonstrated no significant decrease in FEV1.

One hundred fifty-five subjects participated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of spring allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the azelastine groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications. Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication. Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups. Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study. In contrast, although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study, the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study. There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups. Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose azelastine group. Azelastine appears to be a safe, efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis.\r"

The newer antihistamines may induce less drowsiness, which is the most prominent side effect of the older antihistamines. Topical nasal decongestants give fast relief from nasal congestion, but their overuse may result in rebound congestion. Because their efficacy in allergic rhinitis is variable, oral decongestants are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Nasal cromolyn is effective for many patients with allergic rhinitis, but its effect is variable and it is useful in severe allergic rhinitis.\r"

Nasal obstruction and ETO in allergic rhinitis can be alleviated or attenuated by pretreatment with intranasal corticosteroids. Therapy for allergic rhinitis complicated by OME includes treatment of the ear infection with antibiotics and the relief of allergic symptoms with antiallergy medications, including antihistamines, intranasal cromolyn, and intranasal corticosteroids, as well as environmental control and appropriate immunotherapy.\r"

During this process, the patient develops symptoms and mediators are released (including histamine, prostaglandin D2, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene C4) to produce the inflammation characteristic of allergic rhinitis. The allergic process can be divided into three phases: early, occurring within minutes of allergen challenge; late, occurring in about half those challenged about 3 to 10 hours later; and rechallenge, occurring 12 to 24 hours after the first exposure. Mediators are released in each phase; in the late and rechallenge phases, cells, including basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells, enter the nose in large numbers. The basophils can release mediators, increasing the allergic response. Pretreatment of patients with allergic rhinitis with systemic steroids, such as prednisone, prevents the late and rechallenge phases of the allergic process. However, with the exception of kinin generation, such pretreatment has no effect on the early phase. In contrast, pretreatment with the topical steroid flunisolide prevents many more aspects of the allergic process: the production of symptoms and the release of mediators in the early phase and the further development of symptoms and mediator release in the late and rechallenge phases. Flunisolide pretreatment also prevents the influx into the nose of mediator-releasing cells, including basophils. Therefore, physicians should consider pretreating their patients with allergic rhinitis with flunisolide several days before the pollen season begins. Early response to the antigen will be reduced, and the inflammation associated with chronic allergic rhinitis will be suppressed.\r"

Sinus disease manifests differently in children than in adults, with cough, rhinorrhea, and middle ear disease being common and pain, headache, and fever being uncommon. Sinusitis may exacerbate asthma, and as many as 70% of children with allergy and chronic rhinitis have abnormal findings on sinus x-ray studies. Nasal cytologic specimens showing large numbers of polymorphonuclear cells with intracellular bacteria are also evidence of sinusitis. Obstruction of the nasal airways by allergic rhinitis or enlarged adenoids can lead to deviations in facial growth, specifically increased facial length. With the removal of the obstruction and a return to nasal breathing, facial length may become more normal. Sinusitis in children is treated with antibiotics, usually for 3 to 4 weeks, to eliminate the infection. Adjunctive therapy with antihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, and corticosteroids may also be helpful. Topical steroids, such as flunisolide and beclomethasone, can be very useful in pediatric patients. These steroids decrease edema and prevent the release of allergic mediators that may be responsible for an environment favoring the bacterial infection causing sinusitis.\r"

It is characterized by the presence of many eosinophils in nasal secretions, a negative history for allergen exacerbation, and negative skin tests. It is often associated with nasal polyps and shares their exquisite sensitivity to corticosteroid therapy, both systemic with prednisone or topical with flunisolide. Patients with rhinitis can be separated into diagnostic categories and assigned scores on the basis of history of allergic reactions, status of nasal mucosa, response to skin tests, and IgE titer. Based on these criteria, in a study of 142 patients with rhinitis, those with allergic or probable allergic rhinitis could clearly be separated from those with nonallergic rhinitis. Thirty-four percent had allergic rhinitis (mean score 5.4), 15% had probable allergic rhinitis (mean score 3.8), 37% had vasomotor rhinitis (noneosinophilic, nonallergic rhinitis; mean score 0.75), and 15% had eosinophilic nonallergic rhinitis (mean score 0.71). Eighty-three percent of patients with eosinophilic nonallergic rhinitis responded to antihistamines and 93% responded to the topical corticosteroid flunisolide, making the total response 90%. The response of the latter patients to these medications was statistically better than the response of those patients with allergic rhinitis.\r"

  ".W": "Sinusitis, an infection of the paranasal sinuses, has been linked to allergic rhinitis, asthma, and nasal polyps. Sinusitis is a common complication of allergic rhinitis, which can lead to inflammation of the sinus mucosa, obstruction of the sinus opening or ostium, and generally favorable conditions for bacterial growth. Sinusitis can trigger asthma. Stimulated nerves in an infected sinus may result in parasympathetic stimulation to the bronchial tree and in smooth muscle contraction. Sinusitis may be a cause of nasal polyps, which are common when sinusitis complicates allergic rhinitis and even more common in nonallergic rhinitis. Treatment of sinusitis strives to eliminate infection and promote drainage. Ampicillin or amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice. All patients with sinusitis should be treated with antibiotic to encourage drainage. Fluids, expectorants, and decongestants, both oral and topical, should be used. As many as half of patients with sinusitis also have marked rhinitis (either allergic or nonallergic), nasal polyps, or swollen, edematous mucosa; these patients should also receive topical steroids, such as flunisolide. Flunisolide promotes drainage and aeration by decreasing inflammation, swelling, and the influx of white blood cells. Persistent sinusitis may need to be treated surgically.\r"

Eating behaviors may be influenced also by modeling after others, by the client's cognitions or thoughts, and by self-perceptions of efficacy. To enhance the maintenance of eating changes, relapse prevention uses intervention strategies to help the client cope with high-risk situations.\r"

This historical review highlights the introduction, demonstration, and adoption of management tools and techniques in the profession, with particular emphasis on quantitative management science techniques. Seven classifications of management science techniques were used for the content analysis. Although applications of forecasting, simulation, linear programming, and queuing models have been reported in the Journal, a gap is evident between the demonstration of management science techniques and operational use of these techniques in dietetic practice. Dietetic researchers, practitioners, and educators have vital roles in facilitating the transfer of quantitative management science technology into operational dietetic practice. Assessment of the state-of-the-art of dietetic management practice relative to proven quantitative management science techniques reveals the need for improved technology transfer to enhance professional ability in both tactical and strategic decision making.\r"

The earlier reports are for the most part in accord with more recent ones, despite being diagnostically less specific in psychiatric and hematologic terms. These symptoms seem to fall into several clinically separate categories: slow cerebration; confusion; memory changes; delirium, with or without hallucinations and/or delusions; depression; acute psychotic states; and (more rarely) reversible manic and schizophreniform states. While there still remain abundant hematologic, psychiatric, neurologic, or nutritional reasons for obtaining a serum vitamin B12 level, its use in the investigation of the etiology of a patient's dementia seems unjustified. However, acute or subacute changes in a demented patient's mental status, specifically a clouding of their consciousness, may make such testing advisable as part of the complete workup of their delirium regardless of a normal hematologic picture.\r"

  ".W": "With the graying of America, more older persons will be driving. Physiological changes associated with normal aging and diseases that commonly affect the elderly may compromise their ability to drive safely. Although all states have regulations governing driving licensure, few offer specific guidelines regarding older persons. Accordingly, much of the responsibility for determining medical competence to drive and counseling patients in this regard is left to physicians. Normal physiologic changes may limit sensory information, particularly visual, available to the driver. In addition, chronic diseases in older persons including coronary artery disease, dementia and other neurologic disorders, diabetes mellitus, and drug use may increase the risk of crashes while driving. Once the question of competence to operate an automobile has been raised, ethical dilemmas must be addressed regarding the benefit of continued driving for the individual versus the risk to that person and society as a whole. In this article, we review the medical grounds for determining competence to drive, discuss ethical implications, and report current legal regulations for physicians and aging drivers. Future directions and possible areas for further research are outlined.\r"

Inexpensive microcomputer-based hardware and software makes it possible for pharmacists to provide elderly patients with effective instructions.\r"

  ".U": "89054859\r", 
  ".W": "It was recently demonstrated that murine keratinocytes upon irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light release an immunosuppressive cytokine which blocks the biological activity of interleukin 1 (IL 1). This epidermal cell derived inhibitor (EC-contra IL 1) exhibits a molecular weight of 40 kD and a pI of approximately 9.0. EC-contra IL 1 in vivo possibly may penetrate through the basal lamina and subsequently cause systemic immunosuppression following UV-exposure. In the present study, we tested whether EC-contra IL 1 can also be detected in vivo. Serum samples obtained from total body UV-exposed mice were subjected to HPLC gel filtration and tested for IL 1 inhibitory activity. While a non-specific high molecular weight (300 kD) suppressor factor was detected in sera of both UV-exposed and sham treated control mice, a specific IL 1 inhibitor exhibiting a molecular weight of 40 kD was observed only in sera of UV-exposed mice. This cytokine named serum-contra IL 1 was maximally released 24 h after UV-exposure, exhibited a pI of 9.0, and blocked the activity of natural as well as recombinant interleukin 1 in a dose dependent manner. Serum-contra IL 1 did not suppress interleukin 2 or interleukin 3 and did not inhibit spontaneous cell proliferation. The present biochemical and biologic data suggest that serum-contra IL 1 and EC-contra IL 1 appear to be closely related if not identical. These observations therefore indicate that keratinocytes upon UV-irradiation in vivo release EC-contra IL 1 which may at least partly be responsible for the immunosuppression following UV-exposure.\r"

To determine whether this effect is caused by decreased vascular production of the vasodilator prostacyclin, we compared the ability of normal and jaundiced human serum to promote prostacyclin production in rat aortic tissue. Vascular prostacyclin production was significantly decreased after incubation of aortic tissue with jaundiced serum as compared with normal serum. Because lipid peroxides can inhibit prostacyclin synthesis, the relation of lipid peroxides to prostacyclin production was examined. Compared with normal serum, jaundiced serum contained higher concentrations of lipid peroxides and lower levels of selenium, an essential component of glutathione peroxidase. Prostacyclin production correlated inversely with the lipid peroxide level and directly with selenium concentration. These data demonstrate that jaundiced serum is deficient in promoting vascular prostacyclin production in vitro, and that this effect is associated with high levels of serum lipid peroxides. These findings may explain the propensity of jaundiced serum to increase vascular sensitivity to catecholamines.\r"

Religious variables occurred at a relatively low rate, even among articles with some psychosocial content. The clear preponderance of religious measures pertained to patients rather than to providers, and religious variables were generally analyzed descriptively, not inferentially. In spite of an encouraging use of some measures of religious beliefs and practices, there remained a significant focus on denominational measures of religious status. These findings suggest that the consideration of religious variables in the family medicine literature has not been commensurate with the emerging picture of the role of religious commitment in health status and mental health status. It is suggested that increased emphasis on developing an original literature of record about religious variables in family medicine will promote the empirical assessment of the beneficial, neutral, and harmful effects of religion among family medicine patients and providers.\r"

It is concluded that under certain circumstances kappa can be interpreted as an indicator of validity, i.e. unbiasedness of the odds ratio, rather than simply as one of reliability. Cautions are stressed regarding (1) possible variation in the quality of measurement and (2) possible lack of independence of errors for the paired measurements from which kappa is calculated. An important implication for the design of reliability studies is that they should be conducted in populations where the distribution of the factor of interest is similar to that for the settings in which the measurement technique will ultimately be applied.\r"

Cardiopulmonary data were independently and retrospectively reviewed by three experienced critical care physicians from three outside hospitals. Each physician estimated the optimum level of CPAP for each patient. Variability between reviewers was not statistically significant. The optimum CPAP level based on all reviewers' opinions (8.6 +/- 5.7 cm H2O, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than that selected clinically (13.2 +/- 4.5 cm H2O; P less than 0.05). We conclude that current methodology for monitoring respiratory therapy is inefficient for rapid adjustment of CPAP to appropriate levels.

One hundred four American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I through III patients were exposed to isoflurane (with and without nitrous oxide) or halothane in concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were continuously monitored. Both the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and provoked lower esophageal contractions were measured in situ by using a 24-F probe equipped with provoking and measuring balloons. Combined results demonstrated statistically significant correlations (P less than 0.001) between lower esophageal contractility and MAC. Spontaneous lower esophageal contractions decreased from 1.10 +/- 0.12 (SEM) contractions per minute (0.5 MAC) to 0.42 +/- 0.05 (1 MAC) to 0.18 +/- 0.05 (1.5 MAC). Provoked lower esophageal contractility values decreased from 45 +/- 4 mm Hg (0.5 MAC) to 29 +/- 3 (1 MAC) to 19 +/- 2 (1.5 MAC). Heart rate changes did not correlate with MAC, and systolic blood pressure correlated in only one of three centers. Intracenter and intercenter analyses failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between lower esophageal contractility and heart rate or systolic blood pressure. No intracenter differences in either amplitude or frequency of lower esophageal contractions were observed, despite differences in volatile agents, induction techniques and agents, patient populations, and durations of anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Artificial intelligence can be loosely defined as the discipline of designing computer systems that exhibit \"intelligent\" behavior. This article first introduces artificial intelligence and computer science research and discusses why medicine has proved to be a challenging domain for applying artificial intelligence techniques. A discussion of the central research themes that arise in medical artificial intelligence, many of which are common to different projects and to different medical settings, is followed by a description of specific research projects that apply artificial intelligence techniques in anesthesiology, ventilatory management, and cardiovascular management. Finally, further comments are made on the current state of the field.\r"

  ".W": "Interest in two-wavelength classic, that is, nonpulse, oximetry began early in the 20th century. Noninvasive in vivo measurements of oxygen saturation showed promise, but the methods were beset by several problems. The pulse oximetry technique, by focusing on the pulsatile arterial component, neatly circumvented many of the problems of the classic nonpulse arterial approach. Today's pulse oximeter owes a good measure of its success to the technologic advances in light emission and detection and the ready availability of microcomputers and their software. Many clinicians have recognized how valuable the assessment of the patient's oxygenation in real time can be. This appreciation has propelled the use of pulse oximeters into many clinical fields, as well as nonclinical fields such as sports training and aviation. Understanding how and what pulse oximetry measures, how pulse oximetry data compare with data derived from laboratory analysis, and how the pulse oximeter responds to dyshemoglobins, dyes, and other interfering conditions must be understood for the correct application and interpretation of this revolutionary monitor.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 14 patients with trigeminal schwannoma managed surgically at the Neurological Institute of New York since 1970 is reported. Nine women and five men (mean age 40 years) were diagnosed following a mean symptom duration of 33 months. Abnormalities of trigeminal nerve function were present in 11 patients on admission examination. Facial pain was a prominent feature in eight patients. Two patients, both with schwannomas arising from the trigeminal root, presented initially with typical trigeminal neuralgia. Additional cranial nerve palsies or cerebellar or pyramidal tract signs were noted in eight patients. The surgical approach to these tumors depends on their anatomical location. Four patients had tumors confined to the middle fossa, three patients had tumors limited to the posterior fossa, and seven patients had both supratentorial and infratentorial components of their tumors. Twenty operative procedures were performed on these patients, resulting in complete extirpation in six patients, nearly complete removal in seven patients, and partial removal in one patient. Adherence of the tumor to the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus or the brain stem precluded total removal. There was one postoperative death. In the immediate postoperative period, abnormalities of cranial nerves controlling the extraocular muscles were common. In general, these deficits were transient; however, some permanent loss of trigeminal nerve function occurred in nine patients. Two patients required tarsorrhaphy for neurotropic keratitis, and two patients underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures for hydrocephalus or for a persistent CSF leak. The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 177 months (mean 47 months). The clinical features, anatomical considerations, and surgical approach to these rare tumors are discussed. A clinical review of 106 additional cases of trigeminal schwannoma, reported in the English literature since 1935, is also presented.\r"

Thirty cases of brain abscess in neonates are reported, 27 of which were caused by Proteus species infections. Twenty infants had meningitis and 13 had septicemia. Most of the abscesses were enormous, and multiple abscesses were observed in 17 cases. The frontal region was involved in 22 cases (12 unilaterally and 10 bilaterally). The ventricles were enlarged on the first CT scan in 13 cases. The abscesses were treated by aspiration and antibiotics in 25 cases, and by antibiotics alone in five. A shunt for hydrocephalus was necessary in 14 infants. Four infants died, three from the initial illness and one from a shunt complication. Sixteen children have seizures. Subsequent intelligence quotient (IQ) testing was performed in 22 children: eight (36%) have an IQ at or above 80 and eight have an IQ of less than 60. In the 17 children followed for more than 2 years, the proportion with an IQ at or above 80 fell to 24% (four cases). The absence of initial seizures, sterile cerebrospinal fluid, normal ventricles on CT scans, and early aspiration of the abscess seem to be factors portending a better prognosis in terms of epilepsy and mental sequelae.\r"

The calculation of a myocardium to lung ratio (AM index) to quantify antimyosin uptake was performed. AM index in normal subjects (n = 8) at 48 hr postinjection was 1.46 +/- 0.04. In patients with suspected myocarditis (16 studies in 13 patients), AM index was 2.0 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.001); suggesting a considerable incidence of ongoing cell damage in this group, despite the small proportion of positive right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (RVbx) (4/13). In patients studied after cardiac transplantation (37 studies in 17 patients), AM indexes correlated with RVbx. In patients with RVbx proven rejection (n = 14), AM index was 1.87 +/- 0.19 (p less than 0.001). In patients with RVbx showing infiltrates but not myocyte damage (n = 13), AM index was 1.80 +/- 0.27 (p = 0.02). In patients with normal RVbx (n = 10), AM index was 1.56 +/- 0.17 (p = NS versus controls; p = 0.001 versus those with positive RVbx). Calculated AM indexes correlated with graded visual analysis of the scans (r = 0.823; p = 0.001). Antimyosin scans are an appropriate method to assess myocardial damage in patients with suspected myocarditis and cardiac rejection.\r"

In 60 studies in 22 patients with serum creatinine values of 2 to 8 mg/dl, UD and UI were almost identical: UD = 0.358 +/- 0.976 UI +/- 0.87 ml/min, r = 0.990. However, PD overestimated UD by a large and variable extent: PD = 11.3 +/- 0.843 UD +/- 5.5 ml/min, r = 0.694, and was inconsistent in sequential measurements in individual patients. UC also overestimated urinary isotope clearance: UC = 4.2 + 0.95 UI +/- 3.9 ml/min, r = 0.865. Sequential measurements of GFR in five patients with severe but stable renal failure (mean GFR 5.9 ml/min) showed an average standard deviation of only 0.83 ml/min. Thus both UD and UI appear to be reliable and precise measures of GFR in severe renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "The relative amount of L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (transamidinase) protein in kidneys from rats fed a complete purified diet with and without the addition of creatine and/or glycine was determined by a monoclonal antibody-immunosorbent inhibition assay. Kidneys from the creatine-fed rats had 10% of the transamidinase activities and 78% of the monoclonal antibody immunoreactive transamidinase protein as kidneys from the control rats. An excellent correlation between transamidinase activities and protein was reported previously when the amounts of enzyme protein were determined by immunotitration with polyclonal antibodies. One possible explanation for the contrasting results was that multiple forms of transamidinase are present in rat kidneys. If so, the monoclonal antibody may have recognized forms of the enzyme that were not decreased in amounts commensurate with the decrease in enzyme activities as a result of creatine feeding. Evidence is presented in this report that multiple forms of transamidinase are present in rat kidneys. The distribution of the isoelectric points of the individual forms of transamidinase in kidneys of the control rats appeared to be dissimilar from that in the creatine-fed rats. Therefore, an alteration in the distribution of the individual forms of the enzyme may be a factor in the alteration of transamidinase activities in creatine-fed rats.\r"

Six patients had generalized seizures; the remaining three had diaphoresis with stupor or lethargy. None of the children had serious infections, diabetes, congenital defects of glucose metabolism, or a history of treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Six patients had hypoglycemic symptoms after a prolonged fast, and at least four had ketosis. Eight of the nine patients were receiving propranolol when hypoglycemia occurred. No differences in the daily prednisone dose, the number of transplant rejection episodes, or the frequency of treatment with medications other than propranolol were noted between hypoglycemic patients and 56 normoglycemic age-matched renal transplant recipients. All hypoglycemic patients were subsequently treated with frequent feedings and discontinuation of propranolol. No further hypoglycemic episodes have occurred in eight of nine patients. Symptomatic hypoglycemia should be recognized as a potentially devastating complication of pediatric renal transplantation.\r"

The relevant cytotoxins include Shiga toxin and the closely related Shiga-like toxins (SLTs) produced by some E. coli strains. Intravenously administered immune globulin (IVIG) therapy has been reported to be beneficial in a few children with HUS. We therefore examined commercially available immune globulin preparations for the presence of anticytotoxin-neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxicity and neutralization of the HUS-associated cytotoxins were quantitatively determined by means of a (3H)thymidine-labeled HeLa cell assay. The immune globulin preparations tested almost completely neutralized Shiga toxin (produced by S. dysenteriae 1) and SLT-I (produced by E. coli serotype 026:H11). Twofold dilutions of the preparations showed significant (p less than 0.01) neutralizing titers of 1:64 to 1:128. No significant neutralization (greater than 20%) of SLT-II (produced by E. coli strain C600 (933W] was noted. The IVIG preparation lost its inhibitory activity when passed through a protein A-Sepharose column, which bound immune globulin, indicating that its neutralizing effect is related to the antibody content. We also examined sera from 30 children without diarrhea or HUS; only one child had neutralizing titers against Shiga toxin (1:64) and SLT-I (1:128). Immune globulin preparations contain anticytotoxin-neutralizing antibodies, a finding that warrants further investigation of the therapeutic role of these preparations in early treatment of children with HUS related to Shiga toxin and SLT-I.\r"

One hundred seventy-eight patients, aged 4 to 29 years, received appropriate symptomatic therapy, including specific doses of aspirin or acetaminophen, plus penicillin (91 patients) or placebo (87) for the initial 48 hours of illness. All had 24-hour office and 48-hour telephone reevaluations. In 123 patients (57 with clinically severe pharyngitis), throat cultures yielded GABHS. Penicillin provided a margin of 20% improvement over anti-inflammatory therapy for the complaint of sore throat only after 48 hours of treatment (for the 123 patients with GABHS, p = 0.01; for the 57 with both severe pharyngitis and GABHS, p = 0.05). No significant improvement was noted for fever, malaise, odynophagia, exudate, adenitis, or pharyngitis. The failure of penicillin to provide much additional benefit makes its routine early prescription specifically for symptomatic relief questionable.\r"

The results were evaluated for seven groups of providers: professional staff, residents (postgraduate years 1-4), nurse practitioners and student nurse practitioners. The range of smears with endocervical cells for individual providers was 22.2-73.1%. Significant differences existed between all the groups. Longer training did not equate with greater skill in obtaining endocervical cells. Obtaining adequate smears appears to be as much an art as a science.\r"

Three women came to the emergency room of a community hospital with pelvic cramps and significant uterine bleeding containing clots. In two cases the cervix was soft and dilated, but in no case was the uterus smaller than was appropriate for the gestational age. Ultrasonic evaluation revealed a set of twins in all three patients. Patient 1 experienced early disappearance of a gestational sac (before ten weeks). Ultrasound demonstrated a blighted ovum in patient 2 until the 24th week of pregnancy. Macroscopic examination of patient 2's placenta at the birth of a normal, term, singleton infant revealed a compressed gestational sac. Patient 3 had developed a fetus papyraceous of 26 weeks' gestational size along with a normal singleton pregnancy. The only apparent complication associated with disappearance of a twin was first-trimester bleeding. Apparently a vanishing twin need not adversely affect the development of a coexisting singleton pregnancy. Therapeutic dilation and curettage for threatened or inevitable abortion should be avoided until a sonogram rules out the presence of a potentially surviving twin.\r"

The cytotoxicity of etoposide is caused by the induction of DNA damage. The occurrence of the DNA lesions can be explained by the capacity of the drug to interfere with the scission-reunion reaction of mammalian topoisomerase II by stabilizing a cleavable complex.\r"

Serial real-time ultrasound examinations were performed preoperatively as well as at 1 week, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Ninety-three patients completed the study, with a total of 181 kidneys at risk. Hydronephrosis of mild to moderate degree developed in 15 kidneys (8 per cent) in 11 patients (12 per cent). All patients were asymptomatic, and the obstruction resolved spontaneously in 10 of 11 patients, including 9 within 3 months of onset. Only a single case persisted at 1 year. This study confirms that the hydronephrosis that occurs within the first year after aortic bifurcation graft surgery is not uncommon but it is rarely of clinical significance in the asymptomatic patient.\r"

In 1 patient the sonographic urethrogram identified a bulbar urethral stricture not seen on a retrograde urethrogram. In 2 patients a bulbar urethral sinus tract was found by the retrograde urethrogram but not by the sonographic urethrogram, although the remaining 2 sonographic urethrograms correctly identified the urethral pathological condition. Structures outside the lumen of the urethra including the urethral wall, corpus spongiosum, corpus cavernosum, bulb and external urinary sphincter were seen clearly by the sonographic urethrogram. The fossa navicularis can be visualized as well. Foreign bodies in the urethra, straddle injury and stricture disease were correctly diagnosed by the sonographic urethrogram. No patient reported discomfort during the examination. The sonographic urethrogram provided valuable information about the luminal and extraluminal anatomy of the anterior urethra. Further long-term studies will be necessary to assess its ultimate diagnostic potential.\r"

  ".W": "Based upon the rapid early renal excretion of bone imaging radiopharmaceuticals, we performed a prospective study to determine the use of combining renal evaluation with routine bone scans in 79 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. The radionuclide renal scintigraphy consisted of a 1-minute sequence of 2.5-second frames with a bolus injection of 99mtechnetium-methylene diphosphonate followed by a series of 2-minute images for 24 minutes. Whole body bone scans were performed after a 3-hour delay. All patients had at least 1 confirmatory study with excretory urography (62), ultrasonography (49) or computerized tomography (30). Results were interpreted independently and compared. Ten studies were normal. Radionuclide renal scintigraphy was able to identify 45 of 49 cortical abnormalities (90 per cent) with a false positive rate of 4 per cent. Accuracy of renal cyst detection was only 47 per cent (15 of 32 cases). All acutely obstructed kidneys were identified correctly by radionuclide renal scintigraphy (5 of 5 cases). Of 12 chronically obstructed kidneys 8 (67 per cent) were identified correctly. The 4 missed kidneys were small and nonfunctioning, and they were diagnosed correctly as such but obstruction as the etiology of nonfunction was unidentifiable by radionuclide renal scintigraphy. The false positive rate of obstructive diagnosis by radionuclide renal scintigraphy was 24 per cent (4 of 17 cases). These findings demonstrate that renal evaluation combined with routine bone scanning is an effective screening procedure for renal complications of prostate cancer; no significant abnormalities were missed. The procedure is entirely free of morbidity and does not add to the radiation dose from the bone scan. Furthermore, it is cost-effective, since it avoids the routine need for 2 separate procedures at followup of patients with prostate cancer.\r"

Five years after transplantation 50 per cent of the grafts in children with posterior urethral valves were functioning, while 73 and 75 per cent, respectively, of the grafts were functioning in children with vesicoureteral reflux and in the control group. Renal function during the 5 years was significantly better in children in the control group and in those with vesicoureteral reflux than in children with posterior urethral valves.

In the other case the diagnosis was made intraoperatively and simple excision of the lesion with testicular sparing was performed. High resolution real-time ultrasound should be performed routinely for all suspected testicular masses in children. Benign testicular tumors are more common than in adults and ultrasound may permit identification of lesions that can be excised locally with testicular preservation. Should the diagnosis of a simple, small intratesticular cyst be made by ultrasound regular followup may be appropriate. Should enlargement occur surgical excision can be done with the possibility of gonadal preservation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of oncogenes in the development of metastatic ability by prostatic cancer, the viral-Harvey-ras (v-H-ras) oncogene was introduced into the Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, AT2.1 by means of DNA transfection. The AT2.1 cell line is a cloned cell line that is anaplastic, rapidly growing, and has low metastatic potential; after subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation in syngeneic rats, fewer than 10% of inoculated rats develop distant metastases. Calcium phosphate mediated DNA transfections of AT2.1 cells were performed with the v-H-ras oncogene or with control DNA. The in vitro growth rate of cloned transfectants, which contain and express the v-H-ras oncogene is similar to that of untransfected AT2.1 cells and of control transfectants. After s.c. inoculation in syngeneic rats, all transfectants produced rapidly growing tumors with similar growth rates. While control transfectants had low metastatic ability comparable to untransfected AT2.1 cells, the H-ras expressing transfectants metastasized in over 80% of inoculated rats. While the mechanism by which nonmetastatic Dunning tumor sublines spontaneously develop high metastatic ability in vivo during serial s.c. passage has not been addressed in the present studies, these studies do demonstrate that expression of an activated H-ras oncogene can reproducibly convert a tumorigenic nonmetastatic prostatic cell line to a highly metastatic state.\r"

When the liquid fails, vapor-filled cavities can grow to relatively large sizes and subsequently collapse with enormous violence. This phenomenon, called acoustic cavitation, has been shown to cause severe erosion in materials exposed to cavitation fields. It is proposed in this paper that ESWL devices generate acoustic cavitation in vivo and that the high speed liquid microjets produced during cavitation bubble collapse play an important role in renal calculi disintegration.\r"

We have used duplex scanning, measuring relative changes in velocity throughout the entire length of the graft, to detect nonhemodynamic stenoses (i.e., stenoses without a significant change in ankle-brachial pressure indexes) as well as more severe lesions during the postoperative period. Seventy-five in situ vein grafts were assessed at three monthly intervals from operation with duplex scanning and intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Nineteen grafts (25%) had angiographically documented stenoses at a mean follow-up of 12 months. All 19 stenoses were detected independently by duplex velocity ratio criteria and 15 were correctly graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The results suggest that duplex-derived velocity ratio criteria are appropriate for graft surveillance and for determining the natural history of even minor stenoses to identify the optimal time of surgical intervention.\r"

Technically satisfactory duplex scans were obtained in 49 of 59 patients (84%) at an average follow-up of 32 months (maximum 11 years). Arteriograms were available for correlation in 51 arteries or bypasses in 36 patients. Duplex scans accurately classified 8 of 10 stenotic (greater than 60% diameter reduction) or occluded vessels and 36 of 41 patent vessels. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 86%, sensitivity was 80%, and specificity was 87%. We confirmed previous reports that decreased diastolic flow correlated with advanced renal parenchymal dysfunction. We conclude that a normal duplex scan makes it highly unlikely that arteriography will reveal significant recurrent disease. An abnormal duplex scan, particularly in the presence of hypertension or deteriorating renal function, warrants arteriography.\r"

To determine the prevalence of such lesions, duplex scanning was performed on 348 unselected volunteers without symptoms who attended hospital-sponsored health fairs. There were 209 women and 139 men whose ages ranged from 24 to 91 years. Risk factors included hypertension (37%), diabetes (8%), and smoking (23%). One hundred seven subjects (31%) had evidence of extracranial carotid artery disease, 13 (4%) with greater than 50% stenosis, and three (1%) with greater than 80% stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Bilateral disease was present in 50 patients. Disease prevalence and severity were significantly correlated with age (p less than 0.001) and hypertension (p less than 0.01) but not with diabetes or smoking. The incidence of disease was similar in men and women. Although carotid plaques are common in people older than 50 years of age who do not have symptoms, the prevalence of high-grade stenosis--even in the elderly hypertension population--is low, casting doubt on the cost-effectiveness of generalized screening.\r"

Twenty-four patients, 14 men and 10 women with a mean age of 50 years (range 24 to 72 years), were subjected to duplex imaging and phlebography a mean of 5 years after surgery. Scanning was done with patients in an erect position. A graft was reported as patient if it met the following criteria: it could be imaged in continuity, it could be compressed by the scan probe, and blood flow varied with respiration and was augmented by thigh compression on the symptomatic side. Phlebography indicated that 20 grafts were patent and 17 of these were correctly identified with duplex scanning. Three scans were false negative in obese patients in whom the graft could not be imaged. Four grafts, not imaged, were confirmed by phlebography to be occluded. Compared with phlebography, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 88%. Duplex scanning is safe and accurate way to determine patency after femorofemoral venous bypass if the criteria for patency are fulfilled. If not, the true status of the graft must still be established by phlebography.\r"

The magnitude and configuration of the graft blood flow velocity waveform were the best predictors of graft stenosis. Transformation of the graft blood flow velocity waveform from a triphasic to a monophasic or biphasic configuration coupled with a low (less than 45 cm/sec) or decrease (greater than 30 cm/sec) in peak systolic blood flow velocity relative to initial postoperative levels reliably predicted the presence of a remote occlusive lesion. In 20 (36%) of the 56 limbs, the ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) did not identify graft stenosis. The low sensitivity of ABI in the identification of graft stenosis was due to insignificant decrease (less than 0.15) of ABI (n = 11), incompressibility of the tibial arteries (n = 6), or residual occlusive lesions after surgery (n = 3). Duplex scanning of grafts with low blood flow velocity localized the site of stenosis in 31 (86%) of 36 patients examined. Graft revision increased systolic blood flow velocity from 33 +/- 9 to 77 +/- 18 cm/sec (mean +/- one standard deviation) a velocity similar to immediate postoperative levels (74 +/- 17 cm/sec). Resting ABI increased from 0.61 +/- 0.2 to 0.92 +/- 0.1 after graft revision. Four grafts with low systolic blood flow velocity (range 18 to 40 cm/sec) not revised occluded 5 to 45 days later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Duplex and angiographic studies were performed within one month of each other at a mean postoperative interval of 44 months (range 3 to 122 months). Stenosis of the common carotid (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) was classified into five disease categories (normal or less than 15% diameter reduction [DR], 16% to 49% DR, 50% to 75% DR, greater than 75% DR, and occlusion). The overall accuracy of duplex scanning compared with angiography in predicting recurrent carotid bifurcation disease was 83%, a level of agreement similar to classification of disease involving the nonoperated, contralateral bifurcation (overall accuracy 87%). Recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% DR) or occlusion of the CCA or ICA after endarterectomy was identified with an accuracy of 97%. Overestimation of severity of recurrent stenosis accounted for 11 of 13 duplex classification errors (85%). Presence of moderate (30% to 50% DR) recurrent stenosis of the CCA, tortuosity of the ICA, and severe contralateral carotid bifurcation disease were associated with velocity spectra that predicted a more severe recurrent stenosis at the endarterectomy site compared with angiographic grading. The level of agreement between duplex scanning and angiography was comparable to the interobserver variability in angiographic interpretation. The accuracy reported justifies the use of duplex scanning to grade the severity of carotid bifurcation recurrent stenosis and to follow these lesions for disease progression.\r"

This 15-month study of 109 amputations compared four of these methods: segmental Doppler systolic pressure measurements, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (tcPO2), fluorescein angiography, and skin thermometry. There were 66 BKAs (85% healed primarily) and 43 AKAs (93% healed primarily). The actual level of amputation was determined by the operating surgeon without consideration of the preoperative test results, and the incidence of healing was then related to the test parameters. The average skin temperature at the amputation site was higher (93.7 degrees F) in the group that healed primarily compared with those who required operative stump revision (89.9 degrees F) (p less than 0.001). The mean midcalf tcPO2 was also higher in the BKA group that healed (PO2 = 36.6 mm Hg) compared with those who failed (PO2 = 16.4 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). Qualitative skin fluorescence was less successful in differentiating success from failure. Of the 63 BKAs that fluorescein predicted would heal, eight failed (13%). Doppler pressures at the thigh, popliteal, midcalf, or ankle level were unreliable in predicting healing of a BKA. Formulation of indexes relating absolute pressures to the brachial systolic pressure did not improve the value of this examination. From this review it is concluded that the skin temperature and tcPO2 obtained at the site of proposed amputation were the most reliable prognostic noninvasive examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For hospitals in the highest and lowest quartiles of observed death rates, the difference between observed rates and those predicted by the Medicare Mortality Predictor System is not quite on third smaller than the difference between observed rates and unadjusted national rates. Risk adjustment methods do not show whether the unexplained difference in mortality rates results from differences in effectiveness of care or unmeasured differences in patient risk at the time of admission. Risk-adjusted mortality rates, therefore, should be supplemented by review of the actual care rendered before conclusions are drawn regarding effectiveness of care.\r"

Short-term absenteeism also creates serious ethical and professional dilemmas for primary care physicians who routinely perform school and work release evaluations. Through an inductive analysis of three typical cases, these problems are identified. The major ethical issues involved are discussed, including truth-telling, confidentiality, and a confusion of the professional boundaries of medicine, education, and industry. Through a deductive analysis, it is shown that the conventional approaches to school and work release evaluations fail to achieve satisfactory results. To circumvent these problems, three solutions are proposed: primary care physicians can refuse to do such evaluations, inform the patient of the purpose and rules of the encounter, or perform evaluations only in the context of treatment.\r"

Clove cigarettes are tobacco products. They therefore possess all the hazards associated with smoking all-tobacco cigarettes. In addition, inhaling clove cigarette smoke has been associated with severe lung injury in a few susceptible individuals with prodromal respiratory infection. Some individuals with normal respiratory tracts have apparently suffered aspiration pneumonitis as the result of a diminished gag reflex induced by a local anesthetic action of eugenol (the active component of cloves), which is volatilized into the smoke. The American Medical Association has an existing policy vigorously opposing the use of any tobacco product; no exemption from this policy is made for clove-containing cigarettes.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 466 neonates with transposition of the great arteries, all less than 15 days of age, have been entered into a 20-institution study between Jan. 1, 1985, and June 1, 1987. Seventy-three percent were less than 48 hours old when entered into the study. Two hundred twelve of these underwent an arterial switch repair, and the 1-week, 1-year, and 2 1/2-year survival rates were 82%, 79%, and 78%, respectively. The usual coronary anatomy was present in 67% of the patients. The arterial switch repair was performed in 16 of the institutions. Six among these were shown to be \"low-risk\" institutions, with the prevalence of the demographic and surgical variables seeming to be the same in these as in the other institutions. The 1-week, 1-year, and 2 1/2-year survival rates after the arterial switch repair in low-risk institutions for simple transposition were 96%, 91%, and 90%, respectively; for transposition with ventricular septal defect they were 84%, 83%, and 83%. Only older age at operation (over 14 days of age), in the case of simple transposition, and transposition with ventricular septal defect were risk factors for death in these six institutions. Among the patients as a whole, freedom from reoperation for pulmonary outflow obstruction at 1 week and 1 year was 99% and 89%, respectively. A previous pulmonary artery banding and, possibly, one institution were identified as risk factors for reoperation. Inferences: In low-risk institutions, the arterial switch repair can be accomplished with good early results, which suggests the possibility that the late results will be better than after the atrial switch repair. Since young age was not a risk factor for the arterial switch repair of transposition and ventricular septal defect, this type of repair for this anomaly, as well as for simple transposition, may be more advantageously performed early in life than at 2 to 3 months of age.\r"

  ".W": "Of currently available methods for mechanical circulatory support, the Pierce-Donachy external pneumatic ventricular assist device has proved to be one of the most versatile and effective. Since 1981, 48 patients, aged 15 to 71 years (mean 43.0), with profound cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional therapy with drugs and intra-aortic balloon support, were supported with the Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device. There were four patient groups. The largest group consisted of 30 patients with cardiogenic shock after cardiac operations. Nine required left ventricular support, six needed right ventricular support plus an intraaortic balloon pump, and 15 had biventricular support. Duration of support ranged from 3 hours to 22 days (mean 3.6 days). Eight of the first 11 patients died in the operating room of bleeding and/or biventricular failure. However, 16 patients, (53%) had improved cardiac function, 15 (50%) were weaned, and 11 (36%) were discharged. Of the last 19 patients, 47% survived. Frequent factors in nonsurvivors were myocardial infarction (75%) and renal failure (90%). Common complications in all patients were bleeding (52%) and infection (27%). The second group consisted of 11 patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy or acute myocardial infarction in whom the Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device was used as a bridge to transplantation (left ventricular support, four patients; biventricular support, seven patients). Renal failure, infection, or coagulopathy that precluded transplantation developed in five patients. Five patients were supported for 8 hours to 75 days (mean 20.7 days) before undergoing successful transplantation, with one late death (six months) from rejection owing to noncompliance. One has subsequently undergone successful transplantation after 84 days of support. The third group consisted of four patients, aged 40 to 56 years (means 47.2), who had refractory cardiogenic shock after cardiac transplantation caused by pulmonary hypertension (two patients), hyperacute rejection (one patient), or graft failure (one patient). Despite biventricular support in all four (biventricular assist devices, two patients; right ventricular assist device plus intraaortic balloon pump, two patients), all died of infection and/or renal failure after 12 hours to 6 days (mean 3.4 days) of support. The final group consisted of three patients, aged 36 to 51 years (mean 45), with cardiogenic shock caused by acute myocardial infarction. One patient was supported with biventricular assist devices (3.5 days) and two patients were supported with a left ventricular assist device (8.5 and 15 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation has been recently applied to various forms of congenital heart disease with encouraging short-term results. Between June 1986 and September 1987 we evaluated 16 infants for orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Fourteen had hypoplastic left heart syndrome, one had endocardial fibroelastosis with aortic atresia, and one had anomalous pulmonary arterial origin of the left main coronary. Eight families accepted the treatment program and eight families refused (two because of associated anomalies and six on philosophical grounds). Of the eight patients who were candidates for orthotopic cardiac transplantation, one died 6 hours after diagnosis, one was allowed to die after 60 days because of acquired neurologic complications, and another had congenital cytomegalic virus infection. The remaining five patients (four with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, one with anomalous pulmonary arterial origin of the left main coronary) had orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The operation was performed with absorbable polydioxanone suture with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest in four neonates for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (average time 47 minutes) and bicaval cannulation and continuous bypass in one 11-month-old infant for anomalous origin of the left main coronary. In-house retrieval was used in all. One neonate died of complications as a result of pretransplant donor heart dysfunction and size discrepancy, whereas the remaining three neonates and one infant survived and are home 23 months, 12 months, and 8 months (the patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome) and 17 months (the patient with anomalous origin of the left main coronary) postoperatively. Triple-drug immunosuppression included cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. Rejection was diagnosed by clinical evaluation of child activity and monocyte cell cycle analysis from peripheral blood samples without myocardial biopsies. Routine echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and chest x-ray films were not helpful. Six episodes of rejection were successfully treated in four patients. Twelve-month postoperative catherization in one patient (hypoplastic left heart syndrome) showed appropriate graft growth, no aortic or pulmonary anastomotic strictures, normal right and left ventricular function, and no coronary artery disease. We conclude that infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation is an acceptable procedure for severe forms of untreatable congenital heart disease. The excellent short-term results warrant continued application of orthotopic cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of free radical scavengers on free radical-induced myocardial injury during heart preservation and transplantation was examined. Four groups of nine hearts each were harvested from mongrel dogs (12.5 to 16.5 kg) and orthotopically transplanted to size-matched recipients. All hearts received a continuous perfusion of oxygenated modified Collins' solution (group A). In addition, groups B, C, and D received Fluosol DA and albumin. Preservation perfusion was performed for 18 hours, at 4 degrees C, pH = 7.4, and 20 mm Hg. In group C, recombinant human superoxide dismutase (4,080 U/mg, 20 mg/kg) and bovine catalase (46,200 U/mg, 20 mg/kg) were administered only during preservation perfusion. In group D, these scavengers were administered just before and during reperfusion for 1 hour. Hemodynamic studies were performed before excision of the donor hearts and 1 hour after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels in the coronary effluent were determined during preservation perfusion and reperfusion. Only group A showed a significant heart weight gain (p less than 0.05) and a decline in passive compliance (p less than 0.05) during preservation. Lactate release was higher in group A than in the groups receiving Fluosol DA. In contrast, pyruvate levels in group A were lower than in other groups. The generation of free radicals stayed at a low level during preservation, but significantly increased during reperfusion and was associated with a corresponding increase in creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme. Perfusion with a perfluorochemical solution (group B) inhibited the sharp rise in levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and of creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme and improved cardiac function during reperfusion (versus group A). Exogeneous free radical scavengers administered just before and during reperfusion (group D) significantly ameliorated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme levels and also induced a significant hemodynamic improvement during reperfusion. However, administration of scavengers during preservation did not. This study demonstrates that the generation of free radicals is primarily significant during reperfusion and reoxygenation after ischemia. Thus the best time for administration of scavengers is just before and just after the onset of reperfusion. Furthermore, perfusion with perfluorochemicals effectively maintains aerobic metabolism and ameliorates free radical damage during this period.\r"

The presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes expressing the Leu-7 antigen is a specific marker of renal rejection. We examined whether immunoperoxidase techniques that detect Leu-7 positive lymphocytes could be used to diagnose lung rejection in heart-lung transplant recipients. In lungs from two autopsied patients with lung allograft rejection, numerous Leu-7 positive lymphocytes were present in the donor bronchial mucosa (32 and 65 cells/section), submucosa (23 and 80 cells/section), and submucosal glands (7 and 19 cells/section). These Leu-7 positive lymphocytes were associated with proximal airway injury, including squamous metaplasia, destruction of submucosal glands, and ulceration. In one case, there was bronchiectasis. Both cases also had distal airway bronchiolitis obliterans. In contrast, Leu-7 positive lymphocytes were not identified in the epithelium of the native trachea of these two patients; nor were they found in the bronchial epithelium of two sets of transplanted lungs without evidence of rejection. Only rare Leu-7 positive lymphocytes were evident in the epithelium (0 to 2 cells/section) and submucosal glands (0 to 1 cell/section) of 20 lungs from autopsied patients who had not received a transplant. Application of this technique to epithelial biopsy specimens obtained at bronchoscopic examinations demonstrated that it could be applied to the diagnosis of rejection in living heart-lung transplant recipients.\r"

Laboratory research has established a clinical model and a working hypothesis about the complex pathophysiologic features of the disease and the interaction of the virus with its host tissue. Recent studies have further defined the viral genome and its role in virulence and pathogenicity. Antiviral therapy is effective in some but not all aspects of the ocular infection. A proposed clinical classification of ocular herpes simplex is based on the manifestations associated with viral disease and those associated with the host response and the subsequent structural damage. A plan for medical and surgical management of ocular herpes simplex, based on current knowledge of the disease process, relates to the integrity of the epithelium and the presence of active viral disease.\r"

The analytic advancement that has expanded TSH utility is the noncompetitive \"sandwich\" immunoassay, which is faster and more sensitive than traditional radioimmunoassays. All such assays, however, are not equivalent; therefore, we have developed analytic and clinical performance criteria for evaluating sensitive TSH assays. These criteria are as follows: (1) the overlap between the assay detection limit and the lower limit of normal should be less than 1%, (2) basal TSH measurements should predict the TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation at least 95% of the time, and (3) basal TSH measurements should be 95% sensitive and 95% specific for detecting hyperthyroidism. Three allegedly sensitive TSH assays were evaluated: (1) the Hybritech two-step Tandem-R method (assay A), (2) the semiautomated Boots-Celltech Sucrosep method (assay B), and (3) a modified Ciba Corning Magic Lite method (assay C). Both assay B and assay C fulfilled out criteria for a sensitive assay; assay B had slightly better performance, and assay C was easier to perform.\r"

Selective binding to the glycoprotein oligosaccharide probes rich in mannose residues (high-mannose type) was demonstrated with fimbriated E coli that give mannose-inhibitable haemagglutination. This observation is in accordance with predictions from inhibition studies. Binding studies with the human milk oligosaccharide probes, which resemble structures found on host-cell membranes, revealed adhesive specificity unrelated to the presence of fimbriae. This new type of host oligosaccharide receptor is affected by the presence of the blood group genetic markers. It involves the disaccharide sequence linked to the membrane-associated lipid moiety of host-cell glycolipids, and may have a role in initiation of infection on damaged epithelial cell membranes.\r"

The key techniques are comparison and contrast, but epidemiological analyses of physical activity and cardiovascular health often must rely on circumstantial evidence to assess cause-and-effect relationships. The study procedures must be designed to meet rigorous epidemiological principles: statistical association, temporal sequence, consistency, persistence, independence, dose-response relationship, specificity, alterability, repeatability, and confirmation of findings. Through measurement and contrast, study procedures aim to determine whether physically active persons experience a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease than do persons more sedentary. Based on these principles, current evidence indicates that exercise induces protective benefits against coronary heart disease that enable most persons to approach their potential longevity.\r"

As hemostatic mechanisms have been implicated in disease and have been manipulated in therapy, the relationship to exercise and endurance training demands attention. Studies to date, however, have often been discordant and confusing. This review summarizes and analyzes the literature with regard to the effects of exercise and training on measures of coagulation platelet function, and fibrinolysis in normal human subjects. Although platelet count, coagulation factor VIII activity, and some measures of coagulation activity of the blood may increase after exercise, fibrinolytic potential also increases and there is no convincing evidence of clot formation or change in the overall balance of hemostatic mechanisms with exercise. Relatively few data exist on the effects of endurance training on hemostatic mechanisms. Although platelet function and the response to exercise of some measures of fibrinolytic and coagulation mechanisms may be modified, more standardized, quantitative data obtained by state of the art methods are needed before definitive conclusions are possible. Future studies will benefit from application of more standardized techniques of exercise research as well as attention to closer control of factors known to affect hemostatic mechanisms.\r"

The ideal antihypertensive agent should not have significant depressant effects on the myocardium, should not promote arrhythmias, should preserve the distribution of blood flow to exercising muscle, and should not interfere with substrate utilization. Diuretics, one of the most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensives, have few deleterious effects on exercise performance but have adverse metabolic effects; beta blockers have many adverse effects on exercise performance. Agents which have the least potential for adverse effects on exercise performance and metabolic effects are the converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers, and central alpha agonists. The literature concerning each of these drugs is reviewed and recommendations are made for prescribing for the hypertensive who wishes to engage in vigorous exercise.\r"

All vessels on the arterial side of the vascular bed in these preparations from the conduit arteries to the arterioles contribute to the vascular resistance. The vascular beds autoregulate at rest and during contractions, indicating that the effects of the surgery are minimal. Stimulation frequency and pattern, i.e., twitch or brief tetanic contractions, the force exerted, and the length at which the muscle contracts, combine to determine the metabolic rate, which in turn, establishes the blood flow at a given perfusion pressure. When blood flow is normalized for oxygen uptake, the ratio is similar for twitch and rhythmic brief tetanic contractions. The ratio stays constant over a wide range of frequencies even though the flow increases and is greater than the theoretical minimum set by the maximum arteriovenous oxygen concentration difference. The infusion of vasodilators such as adenosine results in higher flows than those obtained with 6 Hz stimulation alone, indicating the presence of a \"pharmacological reserve\". The peak blood flow measured with isometric twitch contractions at 6 Hz in constant pressure pump perfused muscles at the optimum length for tension development averages 19.7 +/- 1.1 ml.kg-1.s-1. The pharmacological maximum at 6 Hz averages 25.9 +/- 1.6 ml.kg-1.s-1 with an observed maximum of 33.2 ml.kg-1.s-1.\r"

In contrast, measurements of average blood flow in conscious animals at VO2max with radiolabeled microspheres have ranged from about 150-250 ml.min-1.100 g-1. Furthermore, flows in active high oxidative muscles in conscious animals during maximal exercise may attain 500 ml.min-1.100 g-1. Reasons for these apparent discrepancies are unknown, but possible explanations including technical artifacts and differences in mechanical influences on contracting muscles in isolated preparations and exercising conscious animals are discussed. It is concluded that the primary reason for the differences in magnitude of muscle blood flow is the efficient muscle pumping action that occurs in vivo during locomotory exercise.\r"

The increased muscle cross-sectional area is mainly brought about by hypertrophy of individual muscle fibers. There is a greater increase in the area of fast twitch fibers compared to slow twitch fibers. In addition, long-term heavy resistance training may produce fiber proliferation. Mitochondrial volume density decreases in proportion to muscle hypertrophy in response to training. Typically, no capillary neoformation occurs during strength training. Therefore, capillary density decreases consequent to heavy resistance training. It appears, though, that bodybuilders, relying on a high repetition training system, in contrast to Olympic weight- and power lifters, display a small increase in number of capillaries per fiber. Enzyme activities, reflecting oxidative potential; decrease during long-term heavy resistance training, resulting in muscle hypertrophy. Although glycogen storage capacity is enhanced in strength trained athletes, enzyme activities reflecting anaerobic metabolism do not increase in response to heavy resistance exercise.\r"

Strength training may cause adaptive changes within the nervous system that allow a trainee to more fully activate prime movers in specific movements and to better coordinate the activation of all relevant muscles, thereby effecting a greater net force in the intended direction of movement. The evidence indicating neural adaptation is reviewed. Electromyographic studies have provided the most direct evidence. They have shown that increases in peak force and rate of force development are associated with increased activation of prime mover muscles. Possible reflex adaptations related to high stretch loads in jumping and rapid reciprocal movements have also been revealed. Other studies, including those that demonstrate the \"cross-training\" effect and specificity of training, provide further evidence of neural adaptation. The possible mechanisms of neural adaptation are discussed in relation to motor unit recruitment and firing patterns. The relative roles of neural and muscular adaptation in short- and long-term strength training are evaluated.\r"

There is little or no change in left ventricular internal dimensions, in absolute terms or relative to body surface area, resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, and diastolic function of the left ventricle due to resistance training. No change or slight positive effects are noted in systolic function of the left ventricle with training. During resistance training exercises, a large pressor response occurs and is attenuated in resistance trained athletes as compared to control subjects.

Hormonal mechanisms appear to be involved with both short-term homeostatic control and long-term cellular adaptations. Few studies have modeled the exercise stimulus in resistance training to determine the role of different exercise variables to the hormonal response. A variety of resistance exercise protocols result in increases in peripheral hormonal concentrations. It appears that single factor variables such as the intensity (% of RM) of exercise and amount of muscle mass utilized in the exercise protocol are important determinants of hormonal responses. The volume (sets x repetitions x intensity) of exercise also appears to be an important determinant of hormonal response. Still, little is known with regard to other single and multiple factor variables (e.g., rest period length) and their relationships to peripheral hormonal alterations. Collectively, such information will allow greater understanding concerning the nature of the exercise stimulus and its relationship to training adaptations resulting from heavy resistance exercise.\r"

  ".W": "This brief review concerns acute and chronic metabolic responses to resistive-type exercise (RTE) (i.e., Olympic/power weight lifting and bodybuilding). Performance of RTE presents power output substantially greater (10-15-fold) than that evident with endurance-type exercise. Accordingly, RTE relies heavily on the anaerobic enzyme machinery of skeletal muscle for energy supply, with alterations in the rate of aerobic metabolism being modest. Hydrolysis of high energy phosphate compounds (PC, ATP), glycogenolysis, and glycolysis are evident during an acute bout of RTE as indicated by metabolic markers in mixed fiber type skeletal muscle samples. The type of RTE probably influences the magnitude of these responses since the increase in blood lactate is much greater during a typical \"bodybuilding\" than \"power lifting\" session. The influence of RTE training on acute metabolic responses to RTE has received little attention. An individual's inherent metabolic characteristics are apparently sufficient to meet the energy demands of RTE as training of this type does not increase VO2max or substantially alter the content of marker enzymes in mixed fiber type skeletal muscle. Analyses of pools of fast- vs slow-twitch fibers, however, indicate that RTE-induced changes may be fiber type specific. Future studies should better delineate the metabolic responses to RTE and determine whether these are related to the enhanced performance associated with such training.\r"

The purpose of this review is to consider the effects of body cooling on the oxygen transport and therefore exercise capacity. Body cooling results in an increase in resting metabolism that is proportional to the decrease in core temperature (Tc). Furthermore, the energy cost of exercise is increased (10-40%) by a 0.5-1.5 degrees C decrease in Tc. The capability to supply oxygen to meet the increased cost of activity is also reduced by 10-40% for a decrease in Tc of 0.5-1.5 degrees C. The reduced oxygen delivery is a result of a combination of decreased respiratory effectiveness, cardiac function, and muscle blood flow. Other than at rest, cardiac output in air or water with and without body cooling increases similarly with oxygen consumption (6 1/1 O2). Body cooling does result in a reduction of maximal heart rate and cardiac output. We postulate that the primary limitation to oxygen transport is a persistent vasoconstriction mediated by the sympathetic system, to increase body insulation, that blunts the local metabolically mediated exercise hyperemia.\r"

However, exercising muscle imposes very little resistance to heat flux because of the increase in convective heat transfer. Accordingly, the limiting resistance to heat flow is shifted to subcutaneous fat and skin during exercise in cold water. Hypothetical examples are given of how important the subcutaneous fat can be in maintaining a high core-to-water temperature gradient in cold water and the same validated by examples from the literature. Last, hypothetical examples are given of the role cutaneous blood flow must play in controlling heat flux and temperature gradients across the subcutaneous fat layer.\r"

  ".W": "Our understanding of the responses of men and women to cold stress is extremely limited. Various scientists have suggested that there could be gender differences in thermoregulatory responses due to sexual dimorphism in body fatness and its distribution, in body surface area, and in mass. In addition, there are also several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that there are gender-specific physiological responses to body cooling. In cold water studies, women cool more rapidly than men when at rest; this potentially greater stimulus does not result in a greater metabolic response by the women. If both groups increase their metabolism by performing a prescribed amount of exercise, there are no differences in body cooling. However, if they exercise spontaneously, the women select a lower metabolic rate and experience greater body cooling. Thus, it appears that women are less thermally sensitive to cold water. In cold air stress women have a lower mean skin temperature than men, but this is not observed in peripheral skin sites. In contrast to cold water, women do not experience greater drops in deep body temperature than men in cold air. Furthermore, men may be more metabolically sensitive than women to cold air stress. Men also respond to cold air with a bradycardia and increased stroke volume, while women show no change in these parameters. Similarly, men show a greater blood pressure response than women to local cooling of a hand or the face. Many of these gender-specific responses cannot be explained fully by differences in body morphology and support the concept that men and women respond differently to the cold.\r"

Contrary to rat, prolonged exposure to SM cold does not produce non-shivering thermogenesis, as it does in the rat, possibly because of lack of active brown adipose tissue. Instead there is a reduction in heat production, in shivering, and in discomfort through a process known as habituation. No adaptation was found with exposure to SS cold, since shivering and discomfort always prevail and there is indirect evidence of enhanced sympathetic response after repeated exposure to SS cold. Exposure to LS cold leads to adaptive responses in which discomfort and autonomic activity are reduced. It is suggested that LS adaptation is also related to habituation.\r"

  ".U": "89056666\r", 
  ".W": "The question is whether skeletal muscle blood flow (MBF) in humans can reach the peak values of 300-400 ml.100 g-1.min-1 seen in dogs, ponies, and rats. The answer depends on the total mass of active muscle. Total MBF has a fixed upper limit or maximal value set by maximal cardiac output--normally about 25 1.min-1. In a 75-kg man with 30 kg of muscle, total MBF is 22 1.min-1 or 73 ml.100 g-1.min-1. As the mass of active muscle decreases, MBF available per 100 g of muscle increases, but a \"maximal\" value can no longer be defined because it becomes a function of blood pressure and muscle vascular conductance (and not maximal cardiac output) for which \"maximal\" values are also undefined. This paper emphasizes three key points. First, pumping capacity of the human heart is much smaller per kg body weight than in many other species. Second, human cardiac pumping capacity is exceeded by the vasodilator capacity of skeletal muscle; thus, so-called \"peak MBF\" often occurs when metabolic vasodilator and blood pressure-regulating vasoconstrictor mechanisms are competing. Third, in order to observe a peak MBF, one must maximally activate a mass of muscle that is too small to overwhelm cardiac pumping capacity. This experimental approach has revealed that MBF can exceed 300 ml.100 g-1.min-1 in small masses of active human muscle. The upper limit for flow, which depends on pressure, and for vascular conductance is still unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetochore is a specialized structure at the centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes that attaches chromosomes to the mitotic spindle. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that kinetochores may have more than a passive role in the movement of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Kinetochores seem to attract and 'capture' microtubules that grow from the spindle poles and microtubules may lengthen or shorten by the addition or subtraction of tubulin subunits at their kinetochore-associated ends. An attractive hypothesis is that kinetochores function as 'self-contained engines running on a microtubule track'. Here, we show that kinetochores can be experimentally detached from chromosomes when caffeine is applied to Chinese hamster ovary cells that are arrested in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The detached kinetochore fragments can still interact with spindle microtubules and complete all the mitotic movements in the absence of other chromosomal components. As these cells enter mitosis before DNA synthesis is completed, chromosome replication need not be a prerequisite for the pairing, alignment and segregation of kinetochores.\r"

  ".W": "Follicular lymphoma is the most common human B-cell malignancy in the United States and Western Europe. Most of the tumours contain t(14;18) chromosome translocations involving the human bcl-2 gene. Translocation of bcl-2 sequences from chromosome 18 into the transcriptionally active immunoglobulin locus at chromosome band 14q32 in B cells deregulates bcl-2 gene expression, resulting in the accumulation of high levels of bcl-2 messenger. Human bcl-2 transcripts generate two proteins, p26 bcl-2-alpha and p22 bcl-2-beta, by virtue of alternative splice-site selection. Both proteins have in common their first 196 NH2-terminal amino acids but share little similarity with other sequences in a data bank. Although the biological and biochemical functions of bcl-2 are unknown, recent subcellular localization studies indicate that p26 bcl-2-alpha associates with cellular membranes, consistent with a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in its carboxy terminus. The bcl-2 gene may represent a novel oncogene having no known retroviral counterpart. Here we demonstrate the oncogenic potential of bcl-2 through a gene transfer approach.\r"

  ".W": "The distal E7 histidine in vertebrate myoglobins and haemoglobins has been strongly conserved during evolution and is thought to be important in fine-tuning the ligand affinities of these proteins. A hydrogen bond between the N epsilon proton of the distal histidine and the second oxygen atom may stabilize O2 bound to the haem iron. The proximity of the imidazole side chain to the sixth coordination position, which is required for efficient hydrogen bonding, has been postulated to inhibit sterically the binding of CO and alkyl isocyanides. To test these ideas, engineered mutants of sperm whale myoglobin and the alpha- and beta-subunits of human haemoglobin were prepared in which E7 histidine was replaced by glycine. Removal of the distal imidazole in myoglobin and the alpha-subunits of intact, R-state haemoglobin caused significant changes in the affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide and methyl isocyanide; in contrast, the His-E7 to Gly substitution produced little or no effect on the rates and extents of O2, CO and methyl isocyanide binding to beta-chains within R-state haemoglobin. In the beta-subunit the distal histidine seems to be less significant in regulating the binding of ligands to the haem iron in the high affinity quaternary conformation. Structural differences in the oxygen binding pockets shown by X-ray crystallographic studies account for the functional differences of these proteins.\r"

Patients with the WAGR syndrome of aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, mental retardation and high risk of Wilms' tumour have overlapping deletions of chromosome 11p13 which has suggested a possible location for a Wilms' tumour locus. Moreover, many sporadic tumours have lost a portion of chromosome 11p. A second locus at 11p15 is implicated by association of the tumour with the Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome and by tumour-specific losses of chromosome 11 confined to 11p15. Here we report a multipoint linkage analysis of a family segregating for Wilms' tumour, using polymorphic DNA markers mapped to chromosome 11p. The results exclude the predisposing mutation from both locations. In a second family, the 11p15 alleles lost in the tumour were derived from the affected parent, thus precluding this region as the location of the inherited mutation. These findings imply an aetiological heterogeneity for Wilms' tumour and raise questions concerning the general applicability of the carcinogenesis model that has been useful in the understanding of retinoblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "Wilms' tumour (WT), a paediatric renal neoplasm, affect approximately 1 in 10,000 children. One or both kidneys can be affected and 5-10% of tumours are bilateral. Most tumours occur sporadically; however, around 1% of the cases are familial, with siblings or cousins most often being affected. Familial cases are more frequently bilateral, and familial and bilateral tumours are diagnosed at an earlier age. On the basis of these observations, it was proposed that the development of WT requires two mutations. In most sporadic unilateral WT, both are somatic; in familial and bilateral tumours the first is thought to be germinal. Cytogenetic and molecular studies have demonstrated germinal mutations in WT/aniridia patients and somatic mutations in sporadic WT at chromosomal band 11p13. To investigate whether familial predisposition to WT is due to a germinal 11p13 mutation, we studied a WT family with seen DNA markers that span the 11p13 region. We found that familial WT predisposition was not genetically linked to any of the 11p13 markers. This suggests that the gene involved in familial WT predisposition is outside 11p13 and is distinct from the gene involved in tumorigensis and in WT predisposition in WT/aniridia 11p13-deletion patients.\r"

  ".W": "In the vascular system, endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is the name of the local hormone released from endothelial cells in response to vasodilators such as acetylcholine, bradykinin and histamine. It diffuses into underlying smooth muscle where it causes relaxation by activating guanylate cyclase, so producing a rise in cyclic GMP levels. It has been known for many years that in the central nervous system (CNS) the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate can elicit large increases in cGMP levels, particularly in the cerebellum where the turnover rate of cGMP is low. Recent evidence indicates that cell-cell interactions are involved in this response. We report here that by acting on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors on cerebellar cells, glutamate induces the release of a diffusible messenger with strikingly similar properties to EDRF. This messenger is released in a Ca2+-dependent manner and its activity accounts for the cGMP responses that take place following NMDA receptor activation. In the CNS, EDRF may link activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors to functional modifications in neighbouring presynaptic terminals and glial cells.\r"

Peripheral T lymphocytes preferentially see antigen presented by self rather than by foreign MHC molecules, and autoreactive T lymphocytes are deleted. Thus, the peripheral T-lymphocyte repertoire is skewed towards recognition of antigen in the context of self-MHC and towards tolerance to self-antigens. During T-lymphocyte development in the thymus, this repertoire is formed by the interaction of TCR with MHC molecules resulting in positive and negative selection phenomena. Hybrid antibodies (HAbs) that carry binding sites to the TCR and to a surface marker on another cell can engage all T lymphocytes regardless of their specificity. It should be possible to mimic selection processes in normal animals with HAb that specifically link members of a TCR family to MHC molecules on the thymic stroma. We have probed T-lymphocyte development with HAbs linking V beta 8-positive TCR to either class I or class II MHC products in thymic organ culture. Thymocytes exposed to either HAb in an early stage of maturation respond with a significant increase in the frequency of V beta 8-carrying cells. At a later stage of development V beta 8-positive thymocytes are depleted. These results illustrate the succession of positive and negative selection in the developing thymus of normal mice.\r"

Three subtypes of lymphocytes are well defined: B cells that bear surface immunoglobulin and make antibody, CD4+T cells with CD3 alpha beta receptors specific for antigen associated with class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, and CD8+T cells with CD3 alpha beta receptors specific for antigen associated with class I MHC molecules. These T cells are responsible for known forms of cell-mediated immunity. The discovery of a third rearranging T-cell specific gene called gamma (refs 1 and 2) has revealed the presence of a new class of T cells bearing a new receptor type, CD3 gamma delta (refs 3-7). To date, neither the function nor the specificity of cells bearing this receptor has been determined. Because gamma delta T cells are the main lymphocyte of epidermis, it was proposed that such cells could be important in surveillance of all epithelia. We have isolated intraepithelial lymphocytes from murine small intestine, and shown that they predominantly or exclusively express CD3 gamma delta receptors. Unlike the epidermal lymphocytes, these cells also express CD8, and they use a different V lambda gene to form their receptor. This strongly suggests that gamma delta T cells home in a very specific manner to epithelia, where they presumably mediate their function.\r"

This antibody does not affect platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, fibronectin or to type I and III collagen.

On the other hand, the in vitro requirement of unphysiological heating steps suggests that this pathway may not accurately reflect the in vivo pathway, and that other proteins may be required. One approach to identify any additional proteins is to isolate second-site revertants of mutants defective in ribosome assembly. Ribosomal protein L24 is essential in the assembly of 50S subunits. We have identified an Escherichia coli gene, srmB, that, when expressed at high copy number, can suppress the effect of a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation in L24. The SrmB amino-acid sequence has sequence identity with mouse translation initiation factor eIF-4A and with the human nuclear protein, p68. The purified SrmB protein is a nucleic acid-dependent ATPase, like eIF-4A, but can also bind RNA in the absence of ATP and other auxiliary protein factors. The RNA dependent ATPase activity of SrmB suggests that like, eIF-4A, it could be involved in specific alterations of RNA secondary structure.\r"

We obtained optimal specificity of MRI interpretation (100%) if we required at least two of the following three AIS features--size greater than or equal to 6 mm, abutting ventricular bodies, infratentorial location--for a positive MRI diagnosis of MS. Applying these criteria to the MRIs of elderly patients with suspected MS should significantly improve specificity (p less than 0.001) over current quantitative criteria (at least three AIS greater than or equal to 3 mm) without significantly decreasing sensitivity.\r"

We examined long-term oral physostigmine therapy in 14 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease in an extended double-blind crossover trial in which they received physostigmine for five intervals of 4 to 6 weeks in length and placebo for one interval determined at random. At each interval a Selective Reminding Test was administered and three indexes were examined: total recall, long-term recall, and intrusions. As a group, patients' memory test scores were significantly better during the drug period. Two patients who previously had performed worse on drug than on placebo in a short-term trial continued to do so. Nine of the remaining 12 patients performed better on two or more measures on physostigmine compared with placebo. In some cases scores improved up to 50% over placebo values. This improvement was not predicted by response to medication in the earlier short-term trial. Seven patients completed an additional six-interval crossover trial. All but one continued to have improved performance with oral physostigmine and, in grouped data, memory measures remained significantly improved. These results suggest that long-term administration of physostigmine in Alzheimer's disease may be more effective than short-term. This benefit can be sustained for up to a year in some patients.\r"

Daily evening questionnaires and a suggested immobilization test (SIT) performed at bedtime on each recording night documented the effect of L-dopa in RLS. A nocturnal EMG recording of the anterior tibialis muscles revealed the effect of L-dopa on PMS. L-Dopa proved effective in treating both RLS and PMS. Although not present in every patient, leg movements recorded during the SIT exhibited a clear periodicity. These observations support the hypothesis that RLS and PMS are two manifestations of the same central sensorimotor disorder.\r"

All cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy had the iris-clip type of intraocular lens. Graft failure was attributed to rejection, endothelial failure, recurrent ulceration, herpes simplex keratitis, melting, trauma, and recurrent dystrophy. At the end of the study period 28 grafts (68%) were clear and 13 (32%) were opaque. Visual improvement occurred in 28 eyes (68%), deterioration in four (10%), and six (15%) remained unchanged (visual result was not available in three eyes). These data are encouraging in terms of visual outcome and graft clarity in cases of repeat penetrating keratoplasty. Comparison is made between the primary indications and outcome of these re-grafts and eyes requiring only one graft. Initial indications for grafting in both groups were similar, other than keratoconus, which was a significantly more common indication in eyes that required only one graft. Final visual results were better in those eyes undergoing only one graft, compared with those that required multiple surgery.\r"

HIV, a retrovirus, is responsible for gradual and progressive damage to the human immune system. Over the course of years (more than 7 in many), the resultant deficiency in cell-mediated immunity leaves the host susceptible to infections, malignancies, and possible neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Current efforts to better understand this virus, its interaction with the human immune system, its clinical consequences, and its detection will continue to bring us closer to finding effective means of preventing and treating HIV infection. In addition, an understanding of the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, and clinical consequences of HIV infection will contribute to a more knowledgeable approach to caring for HIV-infected individuals and anticipating their many needs.\r"

The AIDS patient may be experiencing social isolation related to discrimination, rejection or isolation by employers, society, family, friends, and even health care workers. It is important not to isolate the patient but to establish a therapeutic relationship. This may be accomplished by being professional, knowledgeable about the issues, nonjudgmental, understanding, and, lastly, sensitive to the patient's needs, fears, and concerns. Patients may be going through the stages of grieving as they try to come to terms with their prognosis. Caring for the adult AIDS patient is both complex and challenging for the nurse as the primary care provider.

The nurse's knowledge and sensitivity to these issues is necessary to meet the challenge of this patient group. Unique aspects of AIDS such as youth, stigma, contagiousness and sexual transmission, combined with neurologic complications, resultant anxiety and depression, and drug and alcohol use present a complicated array of needs to be addressed by the nurse. Crisis and existential theory frameworks are useful to apply to the nursing process when caring for patients facing a life-threatening illness. Goals such as maintenance of psychological well-being and the promotion of psychological growth can occur as the nurse assists the patient and his significant others to confront existential concerns. These concerns include death, meaning, freedom, and isolation. Providing nursing care for this patient population also has an impact on the nurse as he or she confronts mortality and sexuality. This calls for the nurse to examine his/her values and attitudes in order to provide optimal nursing care. In caring for homosexual men with AIDS and their significant others, the nurse is likely to experience personal growth. As the nurse assists the patient and his loved ones to live as they confront potential death, the nurse often gains an added appreciation of life.\r"

Current data from a number of prospective studies of health care workers sustaining adverse exposure to blood or other body fluids from patients infected with HIV-1 demonstrate that the rate for transmission of infection following a needlestick injury is approximately 0.5%. Similar data regarding the risk for occupational transmission of hepatitis B virus infection, however, indicates that the rate of transmission of infection with this virus following a needlestick injury may be as high as 30% and the risk for transmission of other blood-borne infections is poorly defined. Infection control precautions designed to minimize the risk for HIV-1 infection were recommended by CDC shortly following the first reported case of AIDS in the United States. These measures were implemented for patients diagnosed with or suspected to be infected with HIV-1, determined by history-taking or serologic evaluation. The inability of these mechanisms to accurately identify all infected individuals, coupled with the occurrence of undiagnosed or unrecognized blood-borne infections, emphasizes the need for health care workers to consider all patients as potentially infected with HIV-1 or other blood-borne pathogens. Implementation and enforcement of universal precautions should minimize exposure of health care personnel to blood and body fluids and thus substantially reduce the risk for occupational transmission of HIV-1 and other blood-borne infections in the health care environment.\r"

  ".W": "Nurses are morally obligated to give quality nursing care to all HIV-infected individuals that respects their dignity as individuals without regard to their differences in values and lifestyle, the nature of their illness, or their own contribution to infection. This obligation is defended by the principle of beneficence which asserts that nurses should act in ways that prevent harm, remove harm, and promote good to others. Minimal personal risk is inherent in the practice of nursing and is a burden all nurses must bear. Nurses are also obligated to preserve the principle of confidentiality in the practice of nursing. The principle of confidentiality is founded in the patient's right to privacy and the preservation of the nurse-patient relationship. Because HIV-infected individuals may receive great harm from the inadvertent and unwarranted disclosure of sensitive, personal information, nurses need to carefully apply the principle of confidentiality and ethical guidelines to their practice of nursing and to take an active role in the protection of patient confidentiality in all health care systems. Although violation of the principle of confidentiality may be justified when the rights or interests of a third party come into conflict with the duty of confidentiality, the complex issues surrounding HIV infection may make such an argument more difficult to defend, especially in regard to the disclosure of the risk of HIV transmission to sex partners without the permission of the HIV-infected individual.\r"

HIV encephalopathy is currently the most commonly diagnosed neurologic disorder associated with HIV and may in fact occur as a direct result of HIV infection in the brain. In years to come, HIV encephalopathy may assume epidemic proportions. Thus, nurses and other health care workers will have to be well versed in the major symptoms as well as the subtleties associated with this disease. Any drugs effective in treating these neurologic disorders must be capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. AZT is currently being evaluated in the treatment of HIV encephalopathy. Only carefully designed prospective studies will define the natural history of neurologic disorders seen with HIV infection, as well as drugs effective in their treatment.\r"

As the prevalence of genital herpes simplex increases, nurses will be in the critical role of facilitating the patient's successful adaptation to this chronic disease. Nurses need to encourage patients to look at how they can best accommodate the change of events in their life, providing them with accurate, nonjudgmental information. Recommendations for palliative treatment of symptoms and preventive measures for recurrences and referral to support groups are well within the nurse's scope of practice. Counseling in the areas of body image, self-acceptance, and relationships may be warranted. Acknowledgment of and allowing time for ventilation of feelings will aid in the successful management of the disease. Nurses can enhance the patient's well being at a very vulnerable time in his or her life.\r"

  ".U": "89057668\r", 
  ".W": "Human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted virus that has been associated with intraepithelial neoplasia. The incidence and prevalence of the disease has risen dramatically, to epidemic proportions, within the last two decades. Risk factors for HPV are similar to those for intraepithelial neoplasia: early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, high-risk sexual practices, and poor hygiene. Health care workers need to screen all patients for HPV through the use of a comprehensive history, including sexual history, a thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory methods. Pregnant women must be thoroughly screened because they are at increased risk for HPV, plus there has been an association between genital warts at the time of delivery and subsequent laryngeal papillomas in their infants. Treatment is aimed at the elimination of the lesions. Although in some cases lesions spontaneously resolve without treatment, in other cases there is a significant incidence of recurrence, even with treatment. Cell-mediated immunity seems to play a role in recurrence and regression as well as transformation to atypical cells. Transformation of HPV to neoplasia also seems to be related to co-factors that act synergistically in the oncogenic process. Public education, identification of high risk groups, and prevention are mandatory if the spread of HPV is to be contained. Equally essential is to remain cognizant of the fact that HPV is an STD with potentially carcinogenic properties; thus, screening and treatment of sexual partners are mandatory!\r"

It behooves us as practitioners to be alert to the possibility of STDs when any increased risk factors are present upon the initial sexual history. Also, we need to remain alert and vigilant throughout the woman's pregnancy to pick up and to elucidate any factors that might suggest the presence of an STD. In dealing with the pregnant woman during the intrapartal period, we need to be constantly aware of any factors that might contribute to an increased incidence of infection during delivery and postpartum. We cannot be too cautious in scrupulously ruling out any possible perinatal STDs that might adversely influence the neonate. Sexually transmitted diseases are not new to us; however, they present as an ever changing array of entities with ever changing protocols of treatment. The best we can do is to remain attentive and to question minute changes that might indicate a pathologic condition in the pregnant woman or her neonate.\r"

The most common cause of chronic infections is reinfection. The assessment of the client should include both a nursing history and through physical examination.

  ".W": "The importance for taking a sexual history cannot be overstated. In the general patient population, the goal of the history is to assess the impact of illness on a client's sexual health. This information provides the nurse with a baseline for educating the client about his or her sexual adaptation to illness or surgery. Further, the sexual history is a part of the holistic nursing framework for patient care. Nurses working in settings in which they routinely care for clients with STDs have the additional responsibility of utilizing data from the history to educate clients regarding risk factors, re-evaluation of lifestyle behaviors, and preventative measures. Education of clients is crucial to decreasing the incidence of STDs. Nurses need to confront their own values and attitudes regarding sexuality as the first step to overcoming barriers in discussing sexuality with their clients. Additionally, education regarding human sexual behavior is important in expanding nurses' knowledge in this area. I have outlined interview techniques that can be helpful in eliciting the sexual history, emphasizing open-ended questions and ubiquitous statements. These techniques can be useful in both ambulatory and in-patient settings. The format for taking a sexual history has been addressed, with specific questions relevant to clients exposed to STDs. I have pointed to the need for considering the sexual history within the context of the client's life situation and suggested that information regarding sexuality be thoughtfully gathered, taking into account variables such as culture and sexual preference. Finally, this article addresses educating clients for safe sexual practices and emphasizes the need for nurses to counsel all sexually active clients concerning the risk factors for STDs. As the incidence of STDs continue to increase, and particularly as AIDS becomes increasingly widespread, nurses must be in the forefront of educating the public. As a health care profession advocating caring and commitment to holistic care, nursing can contribute to health promotion activities through addressing clients' sexual health.\r"

The same HPV constructs, when cotransfected with a plasmid containing sequences from the Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins murine sarcoma virus provirus (v-fos), produced cell lines that were tumorigenic in nude mice. None of the other activated oncogenes tested, including activated c-myc, displayed any activity with HPV in this cotransfection assay. When the heterologous promoter was replaced by the homologous HPV16 promoter, the transforming effect of HPV16 with either EJ-ras or v-fos required the presence of either glucocorticoid or progestogen. Cell lines derived from transfection of HPV16 with either EJ-ras or v-fos required the continued presence of hormones for proliferation.\r"

This effect distinguished NF-kappa B from a related factor, H2-TF1.

  ".W": "A family of repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences is composed of hundreds of copies distributed throughout the chromosome. Their palindromic nature and conservation suggested that they are specifically recognized by a protein(s). We have identified DNA gyrase [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing), EC 5.99.1.3] as one of the REP-binding proteins. Gyrase has at least a 10-fold higher affinity for DNA containing REP sequences than for DNA not containing REP sequences. Binding effectiveness correlates directly with the number of REP sequences in the DNA. DNase I footprinting shows that gyrase protects 205 base pairs on a REP-containing DNA fragment enclosing the REP sequences. In agreement with the above results, a comparison of the REP consensus sequence with the sequence of previously identified pBR322 \"strong\" gyrase cleavage sites reveals a high degree of homology. Because REP sequences are numerous and found throughout the genome, we suggest they have physiological functions mediated through their interaction with gyrase, such as being sites of action for the maintenance of DNA supercoiling. In addition, we speculate that these interactions may be of a structural nature, such as involvement in the higher-order structure of the bacterial chromosome.\r"

Expression of the membrane-bound oncogene products encoded by v-fms, v-src, v-sis, polyoma virus middle-sized tumor antigen, and Ha-ras increased the apparent molecular weight and phosphorylation of the Raf-1 protein, while expression of the nuclear oncogene and protooncogene products encoded by v-fos and c-myc did not. Changes in electrophoretic mobility and phosphorylation occurred rapidly in response to treatment of cells with platelet-derived growth factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not insulin. The phosphorylation of the Raf-1 protein occurred primarily on serine and threonine residues. However, a subpopulation of Raf-1 molecules was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells transformed by v-src or stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor. Transformation by v-src, or treatment with platelet-derived growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activated the Raf-1-associated serine/kinase activity as measured in immune-complex kinase assays. These findings suggest that proliferative signals generated at the membrane result in the phosphorylation of the Raf-1 protein and the activation of its serine/threonine kinase activity. Raf-1 activation may thus serve to transduce signals from the membrane to the cytoplasm and perhaps on to the nucleus.\r"

The nature of this nucleolytic cut has been investigated by reverse transcriptase mapping, anti-mRNA mapping, utilization of the vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase, and labeling by polynucleotide kinase. We have compared the sequences of target mRNAs with an mRNA of similar sequence but that is not a substrate for the nuclease. This allowed us to narrow down the possibilities for sequence elements that determine nuclease recognition. We hypothesize that this nuclease plays a physiological role in the inhibition of expression of a class of phage proteins.\r"

Together, protections at these sites span six of seven consecutive major grooves and lie on the same helix face. E sigma 54 protects two major grooves of DNA approximately 60 base pairs downstream at the glnAp2 promoter and primarily on the opposite helix face. Experiments using potassium permanganate to probe open complex formation in vivo demonstrate that NRI is absolutely required for E sigma 54 to open the promoter DNA. Together, the dimethyl sulfate and permanganate studies verify [Reitzer, L. J., Bueno, R., Cheng, W. D., Abrams, S. A., Rothstein, D. M., Hunt, T. P., Tyler, B. & Magasanik, B. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 4279-4284] that E sigma 54 occupies the glnAp2 promoter in a closed complex in vivo even in the presence of excess nitrogen and the absence of NRI. Furthermore, the slow step in transcriptional activation is shown to be an NRI-dependent conformational change in the downstream promoter DNA, which results in DNA melting. These observations place interesting restrictions on models describing the mechanism by which NRI activates transcription from glnAp2 at a distance.\r"

To model this syndrome, we have produced transgenic mice that express high levels of the mutant prohormone in their islets of Langerhans. Strain 24-6 mice, containing about 100 copies of the mutant gene, were normoglycemic but had marked increases of serum human proinsulin immunoreactive components. Biosynthetic studies on isolated islets revealed that approximately 65% of the proinsulin synthesized in these mice was the human mutant form. Unlike the normal endogenous mouse proinsulin, which was almost exclusively handled via a regulated secretory pathway, up to 15% of the human [Asp10]proinsulin was rapidly secreted after synthesis via an unregulated or constitutive pathway, and approximately 20% was degraded within the islet cells. The secreted human [Asp10]proinsulin was not processed proteolytically. However, the processing of the normal mouse and human mutant proinsulins within the islets from transgenic mice was not significantly impaired. These findings suggest that the hyperproinsulinemia of the patients is the result of the continuous secretion of unprocessed mutant prohormone from the islets via this alternative unregulated pathway.\r"
