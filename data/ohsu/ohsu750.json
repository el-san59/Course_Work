  ".W": "Endothelial cells were cultured from the umbilical veins of two neonates with type I von Willebrand disease (vWD) and compared with cells cultured in parallel from normal control umbilical veins. In both cases, cultured vWD endothelial cells contained less messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding von Willebrand factor (vWF), and constitutively secreted two- to fourfold less vWF protein than their matched controls. Regulated secretion of stored vWF induced by thrombin or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was also diminished in vWD cells. Both the mRNA and protein produced by each of these type I vWD cells appeared to be of normal size. However, despite the diminished size of the vWF storage pool, electron microscopy of endothelial cells in situ showed normal appearing vWF storage organelles (Weibel-Palade bodies). These studies show that cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells can be used to explore the molecular defects in type I and perhaps other forms of vWD, and suggest that at least some forms of type I vWD are caused by diminished mRNA transcription or subsequent translation due to a defective vWF allele.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbits were given polyclonal anti-tissue factor (TF) immunoglobulin G (IgG) before an injection of endotoxin to test the hypothesis that TF triggers disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after endotoxin. The rabbits had been prepared with cortisone to develop DIC after one injection of endotoxin. Anti-TF IgG substantially reduced the falls in fibrinogen, factors V and VIII, and platelets noted in control rabbits given preimmune IgG before endotoxin. At autopsy 24 hours later, fibrin was present in glomerular capillaries of 4 of 5 control rabbits, but in none of 11 rabbits given anti-TF IgG. DIC was also induced in a second group of rabbits by the infusion, over 4 hours, of 1 microgram/kg of purified, reconstituted rabbit brain TF. This resulted in striking falls in plasma fibrinogen, factors V, and VIII that were diminished, but not prevented by prior treatment with anti-TF IgG. Circulating activated factor VII, induced by either TF infusion or endotoxin, could not be detected after DIC. Mean plasma extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) activity did not fall significantly after endotoxin, and only to about 65% of the preinfusion after infusion of TF. Thus, DIC induced by both agents proceeded despite nearly normal plasma EPI levels. Because EPI neutralizes factor VIIa/TF in vitro only after a short lag period, the DIC that persisted for up to 6 hours after injection of endotoxin suggests that TF activity continued to be generated during this period on cells to which the circulating blood was exposed. All animals given endotoxin became ill with cyanosis, tachypnea, cold ears, and diarrhea, regardless of whether they had received anti-TF IgG to attenuate DIC. Infusion of TF caused some animals to die acutely with pulmonary arterial thromboses, but surviving animals did not appear ill. The findings support the hypothesis that exposure of blood to TF triggers DIC after endotoxin, but is not important for the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced shock.\r"

  ".W": "Uremia is associated with a bleeding diathesis. We investigated platelet adhesion as a cause for the impaired primary hemostasis and the role of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in this process in uremic patients. Perfusions with blood with standardized hematocrit, platelet count, and free Ca2+ ions were performed over inverted and deendothelialized artery segments from human umbilical cords in a modified Baumgartner perfusion chamber. Platelet adhesion in patient perfusates was comparable with control adhesion. However, the high vWF levels present in uremic whole blood did not increase adhesion above the adhesion in control blood with lower vWF levels. These results suggested that a relative adhesion defect was present in patient blood. Control blood in which vWF levels were raised to uremic levels showed the high adhesion that uremic whole blood failed to show. Additionally, in perfusions with uremic plasma in which the initially high vWF level was normalized by dilution with vWF-depleted uremic plasma, adhesion was clearly lower than in normal plasma. Washed patient platelets did not differ from normal platelets in their association with purified vWF, via their adhesion receptors glycoprotein Ib and IIb-IIIa. Patient platelets present in patient plasma showed a similar adhesion defect as control platelets, which were resuspended in the uremic plasma. Therefore, primary defects of uremic platelets were of minor importance for the observed adhesion defect in uremic whole blood. The adhesion defect was not dependent on the presence of uremic vWF; plasma of uremic patients depleted of vWF also inhibited adhesion, and the defect remained present when purified control vWF was added to vWF-depleted uremic plasma. The binding of uremic vWF to the vessel wall and its support of subsequent adhesion were not impaired. These results indicate that the observed adhesion defect was not due to abnormal vWF. Our current results suggest an unknown component present in uremic plasma that directly inhibits platelet interaction with artery segments; however, it has no effect on vWF binding to the vessel wall. High vWF levels in uremic plasma are able to compensate for the defect.\r"

  ".U": "90199073\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that fibrinogen (fg) acts as a subendothelial matrix protein in promoting human endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. In this study we report that EC spreading on fg, at variance with other matrix proteins, requires endogenous matrix protein synthesis and secretion. ECs, upon seeding on fg, promptly released and organized a fibronectin (fn) matrix. Fg was more effective than vitronectin (vn) in promoting the deposition of this protein. ECs treated with monensin to block matrix protein secretion still adhered to fg but did not properly organize their cytoskeleton and adhesion structures. In contrast, monensin did not affect EC spreading either on vn or on fn. Using antibodies to the alpha and beta chains of fn (alpha 5 beta 1) and vn (alpha v beta 3) receptors, it was found that ECs adherent to fg show clustering and organization in adhesion structures of both type of receptors. A faint staining of adhesion structures with alpha 2 but not alpha 3 and alpha 6 antibodies was also observed. Antibodies either to vn or fn receptors were able to disrupt the EC monolayer and to induce EC retraction and detachment, thus indicating that both receptors are important in maintaining a sustained EC adhesion to fg. However, when ECs were treated with monensin only the vn receptor was organized in adhesion structures while the fn receptor was diffusely distributed. This suggests that clustering of the fn receptor is mediated by the release of endogenous matrix proteins induced by the exposure to fg. In conclusion, fg has a peculiar and complex type of interaction with ECs since it requires endogenous matrix protein release and the recruitment of more than one adhesive receptor. This suggests a specific way of response of ECs to each extracellular matrix component.\r"

The CD5 gene expression was in all cases identical to that of T-cell malignancies. The utilization of the various VH and VK gene families was roughly proportional to the estimated gene family size in EBV lines obtained from adult healthy subjects. In contrast we found a statistically significant biased usage of VH6 in CLL and VH5 in CD5+ lymphomas as compared with EBV lines, and of VKIII in both CLL and CD5+ lymphomas as compared with EBV lines. Some differences in the variable gene usage were also noted when comparing CD5+ and CD5- lymphomas. These findings are analyzed in the context of possible mechanisms involved in the malignant transformation of CD5+ B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cell activity is severely impaired in untreated patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). In an attempt to investigate whether this impairment is related to a defect at the target cell binding and/or at the post target cell binding level, we evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HCL patients for their ability to: (1) bind and kill K-562 NK-sensitive targets at the single cell binding level; (2) release the NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF) under different in vitro stimuli, including K-562 and phytohemoagglutinin; and (3) kill K-562 targets in a lectin-dependent cellular cytoxicity (LDCC) assay. This study demonstrates that untreated HCL patients' PBMC show a low ability to form conjugates with K-562 targets at the single cell binding level (5.7% +/- 1.0%) with respect to patients studied after treatment (9.3% +/- 1.3%) and controls (15.0% +/- 4.0%); P less than .05 and P less than .001, respectively. A decreased ability to kill the bound target was demonstrated in untreated cases (1.2% +/- 1.1%) versus patients studied after treatment and controls (12.3% +/- 1.6%, 17.0% +/- 3.1% respectively); P less than .001 in both conditions. After activation of effector cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vitro, an increase in the ability of PBMC to form conjugates with K-562 targets and kill the bound target was demonstrated in each group of patients. Moreover, IL-2 was able to increase the cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive targets in all patients tested. Evaluation of NKCF production showed that untreated patients release low levels of NKCF when PBMC were incubated in the presence of K-562 stimulators (1.8% +/- 0.7%) with respect to patients after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy (7.6% +/- 2.1%) and controls (12.9% +/- 2.2%); P less than .02 and P less than .001, respectively. When the recognition mechanisms were bypassed by triggering the cells with lectins in an LDCC assay, we demonstrated an increase of the lytic activity in both groups of patients with respect to the baseline values. However, the cytotoxic capacity observed in untreated patients was significantly lower than that observed in subjects after IFN-alpha therapy and controls (P less than .001). These findings suggest that the impaired NK activity observed in patients with HCL is related to defects both at the target and posttarget cell binding levels.\r"

  ".U": "90199076\r", 
  ".W": "The CD28 homodimer is thought to function as a signal transducing receptor during activation of T cells. Evidence is presented that the degree of aggregation of CD28 on the cell surface regulates two distinct CD28-associated signals. Binding of bivalent CD28 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 9.3 upregulates lymphokine production by messenger RNA (mRNA) stabilization, without direct initiation of lymphokine mRNA transcription. This signal was not dependent on inositol phospholipid production or activation of a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). In contrast, further crosslinking of CD28 on the cell surface rapidly induced formation of large amounts of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i), but did not stimulate PTK. CD28 crosslinking directly activated a subset of resting T cells, since CD25 (interleukin [IL]-2 receptor alpha chain) mRNA was rapidly induced in purified T cells, and proliferation, even without addition of exogenous IL-2, was sometimes observed. CD25 expression was detected on the cell surface of approximately 20% of CD4+ T cells. The degree of CD28 aggregation required for activation was investigated by preparing soluble 9.3 x 9.3 conjugates ranging in size from approximately 300 Kd to greater than 1,000 Kd, and comparing their function in T-cell proliferation assays with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), anti-CD3, or IL-2. There was a correlation between conjugate size and proliferation with IL-2, whereas costimulation with PMA or CD3 was optimized at a lower degree of CD28 aggregation. The inositol phospholipid (InsP) generation and increase in [Ca2+]i after CD28 receptor aggregation appeared to proceed through a pathway different from the CD3/T-cell receptor (TCR) pathway since it was enhanced by pretreatment with PMA, while the InsP and [Ca2+]i signal from crosslinking CD3 was suppressed by PMA. Furthermore, the proliferation response to CD28 aggregation was resistant to inhibition by CD3 modulation. Thus, CD28 aggregation appears to trigger a phospholipase C activation pathway that differs from the CD3/TCR-linked pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Acute myelofibrosis is often associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKBL). Although the exact mechanism for the progression of myelofibrosis in AMKBL is unclear, certain humoral factors from megakaryoblastic cells, the precursors of platelets, may be involved in the enhancement of collagen synthesis by bone marrow fibroblasts. The present study, therefore, is an investigation of the possible pathogenic role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), known to be a very potent collagen-stimulating factor found in platelets in the myelofibrosis of AMKBL. The results obtained were as follows: (1) Conditioned media from peripheral megakaryoblasts taken from an AMKBL patient and from established megakaryoblast cell lines (MEG-01) had much greater stimulatory effects on collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts than conditioned media from other leukemic cell types. (2) Based on an assessment of soft agar colony formation, there was greater TGF-beta activity in media that had been conditioned from megakaryoblasts than in media from other leukemic cell types. (3) When compared with other leukemic-cell types, megakaryoblasts showed substantially greater expression of TGF-beta mRNA that was hybridized at 2.5 kb with a TGF-beta cDNA probe, and TGF-beta polypeptides were detected at 13 Kd with anti-TGF-beta antibodies. (4) The addition of the anti-TGF-beta antibody inhibited the stimulatory effects of the megakaryoblast conditioned medium on collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts. These results clearly suggest that megakaryoblasts produce and secrete an active form of TGF-beta and stimulate collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts in a paracrine manner.\r"

Because some shed tumor gangliosides have potent tumor-enhancing properties, significant ganglioside shedding could influence tumor progression. We examined this possibility in a human tumor, neuroblastoma. Ganglioside shedding, measured as circulating tumor-derived GD2 ganglioside, and the outcome of 74 patients with advanced stage (III and IV) disease were studied. Progression-free survival (PFS) was inversely related to circulating GD2 levels at the time of diagnosis (P = .018). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the quartile of patients having the highest circulating GD2 levels (greater than or equal to 568 pmol/mL) had a strikingly different outcome from the quartile of patients with the lowest (less than or equal to 103 pmol/mL) GD2 levels (P = .013): median PFS was shorter (9 v 28 months), and the long-term survival rate lower (2-year PFS of 24% v 70%). We conclude that more rapid disease progression and lower survival rate are associated with high circulating GD2 levels at diagnosis and speculate that shed neuroblastoma tumor gangliosides play a role in accelerating tumor progression.\r"

Results on hemoglobin (Hb) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) release from RBCs, percent decrease of single platelets in the bulk, and percent of test surface covered with platelets were obtained in a cone-and-plate (CP) viscometer for samples of whole blood, suspensions of RBC ghosts in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and suspensions of RBCs in either PRP or platelet-poor plasma. Results obtained over the shear rate range studied for samples of normal hematocrit indicated that low-stress shearing led to ADP and Hb release from intact RBCs; shear-induced release of ADP from RBCs was about twice that of platelets, and of the total ADP released, the ADP released from RBCs contributed about six times that of the platelets to single platelet reduction in the bulk and about twice that of the platelets to platelet adhesion, ie, coverage of the test surface with platelets. Results obtained for various hematocrits showed that above a threshold hematocrit of about 25% to 35% the RBCs (suspended in PRP) had a greater contribution to ADP release, platelet adhesion, and platelet aggregation than the platelets themselves. Single platelet reduction for samples of RBC ghosts suspended in PRP correlated with shear rate level and not with shear stress.\r"

All patients received a conditioning regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by infusion of marrow from an HLA-identical sibling. Intravenous infusions of a commercial Ig preparation were administered every 2 weeks until day 120 posttransplant. Nine patients developed pneumococcal infections at 6 months or greater posttransplant. Infection was associated with low levels or the absence of detectable serum IgG2 and IgG4. At the time of infection, 4 of 7 patients evaluated had undetectable IgG2, while 5 of 7 had undetectable levels of IgG4. After infection, none of the 8 patients evaluated had detectable levels of IgG2, and only 2 of 8 had detectable levels of IgG4. In contrast, all 16 patients without pneumococcal infection had IgG2 levels of 102 mg/dL or greater, and IgG4 levels of 20 mg/dL or greater. It appears that IgG2 and IgG4 subclass deficiencies after allogenic bone marrow transplantation contribute to susceptibility to pneumococcal infection. After pneumococcal infection, IgG2 and IgG4 levels remain low for a prolonged period and patients remain susceptible to infection by encapsulated organisms.\r"

However, their reliability as a means of eliciting symptoms of urological disease has not been established. A questionnaire designed to elicit symptoms of urological disease was validated in 120 patients (36 out-patients, 27 in-patients and 57 community patients). All found the questionnaire acceptable and the completion rate was 99%. Only 3 of 648 answers were changed on the test-retest analysis. Consistency, as assessed by a comparison of responses by clinician and patient, was satisfactory in 11 of 15 questions relating to urological symptoms and the questionnaire successfully identified a high risk group of patients from the community requiring further urological evaluation. The need to include results of a preliminary validation study when reporting results obtained by a self-administered questionnaire is emphasised.\r"

VUR had an overall incidence of 8.6% within this population, with a range of 5.1% in patients with normal urodynamics to 15.6% in those with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. The common denominator between VUR and urodynamic measurement appears to be the generation of high intravesical pressures. These findings suggest that VUR is not uncommon in the male population, is usually asymptomatic and should respond to the treatment of any underlying bladder abnormality.\r"

The contractile group accounts for 31% of patients and rarely requires surgery (a \"clam\" ileocystoplasty). The acontractile group accounts for only 9% but more commonly requires surgical treatment, usually the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). The intermediate group accounts for 60% of patients and usually requires surgery. If there is no significant sphincter weakness incontinence, a \"clam\" ileocystoplasty alone is performed; if there is sphincter weakness, a \"clam and a cuff\" procedure is performed with implantation of the remainder of the AUS at a later date, if required.\r"

Assessment of staining intensity, by 3 independent examiners, revealed a strong negative correlation between density of desmosomal staining and degree of invasion (P = 0.012). Nests of strongly staining cells were identified in several invasive tumours, possibly indicating early squamous differentiation. Invasive tumour cells in the subepithelial stroma also stained strongly with the antibody. Correlation with clinical course, however, revealed no significant association between desmosomal staining and the incidence of recurrence or progression. It is suggested that staining with this antibody may be of value in detecting both stromal invasion and early squamous differentiation of transitional cell carcinomas. Both this and previous studies emphasise the value of this antibody as an epithelial marker in neoplasia.\r"

We have performed 137 ETARs in 81 patients with a 30-day mortality rate of 11.1 per cent and a postoperative complication rate of 15.3 per cent. Thirty-one patients (38 per cent) had ETAR for palliation: in this group rectal bleeding was abolished or improved in 66 per cent of patients, altered bowel habit (diarrhoea) corrected in 77 per cent of patients, faecal incontinence improved in 50 per cent of patients and rectal pain (including tenesmus) improved in 50 per cent of patients. Twenty-three patients (28 per cent) were treated for large benign rectal polyps: in this group symptoms were universally abolished. The technique is particularly suited to the management of these patients. Twenty-seven elderly patients with theoretically 'curable' rectal cancer underwent ETAR with a 78 per cent crude survival rate at 1 year. While long-term results remain to be assessed, ETAR appears a useful technique for treating selected patients with rectal tumours.\r"

Bilateral orchiectomy (BLO) was performed in 193 patients. Of these patients, 71 of 246 (29 per cent) received perioperative blood transfusion. After controlling for differences due to a number of variables, transfusion of non-autologous blood was shown to be associated with a significant negative effect on survival. Perioperative transfusion of non-autologous blood should be avoided in patients with malignancy, unless there are clear overriding clinical indications. Prospective trials are needed urgently.\r"

Sixteen patients had a Marlex mesh posterior rectopexy alone and 13 underwent a sigmoidectomy combined with a sutured posterior rectopexy. Preoperative and post-operative assessment included manometry, a saline infusion test and video-proctography. Hospital stay, control of prolapse and complications were comparable in both groups. Restoration of continence occurred in nine of the 12 incontinent patients after Marlex rectopexy, compared with six of nine after sutured rectopexy and sigmoidectomy. Constipation persisted in three patients who were constipated before operation and in four of 13 who had previously normal bowel habits became constipated after Marlex rectopexy; constipation persisted in one of five previously constipated patients while none with previously normal bowel habits became constipated after sutured rectopexy and sigmoidectomy. Sigmoidectomy combined with sutured rectopexy was safe and as efficient as Marlex rectopexy in prolapse control and improvement of continence; significantly fewer patients were constipated (one of 13) after sigmoidectomy than following rectopexy alone (seven of 16). A randomized trial now seems justified.\r"

To clarify the situation we studied the body composition of 14 patients with well functioning ileostomies and 20 patients with well functioning J pouches. Both groups were compared with two closely matched control groups. Body weight, total body fat, fat-free mass, total body water and extracellular water were measured by neutron activation analysis, tritiated water and bromide dilution respectively; 24-h collections of urine and stool were analysed for volume and electrolyte content. The results show that the body content of water and extracellular fluid in ileostomy patients and J pouch patients is normal. The faecal volume and chemistry is similar in both groups resulting in a similar and significant degree of urinary sodium retention.\r"

  ".W": "The S ileal reservoir has been superseded in this unit but 76 patients had this operation between 1976 and 1983. Forty-one (54 per cent) patients had to catheterize the reservoir to evacuate faeces and this was primarily due to the long efferent ileal limb. In six patients, the need to catheterize and other problems with defaecation were such that surgical correction of the efferent ileal limb was undertaken. These six patients are reported. Presenting features were the need to catheterize the reservoir, difficulty in catheterizing, faecal incontinence, stenosis of the efferent ileal limb and transanal prolapse of the efferent ileal limb. All patients had an excessively long efferent ileal limb of 8 cm or more which was resected and reanastomosed to the anal canal. The resection was performed endoanally in three patients but was successful in only one. In the two patients in whom endoanal excision was unsuccessful and in the remaining three resection of at least 5 cm was performed transabdominally with endoanal reanastomosis. Three of these five patients were converted from catheterizing the reservoir to spontaneous evacuation, but two patients still needed to catheterize. All six patients benefited in terms of the need for, or frequency of, catheterization, or by improvement in continence. Excessive length of the efferent limb of an S ileal reservoir may cause unsatisfactory defaecation, which may be improved by partial resection. The transabdominal route is recommended for the resection, with endoanal reanastomosis. This surgery is potentially problematic and, although no anastomotic leakage was encountered, a covering loop ileostomy is recommended.\r"

The diagnosis of amoebic colitis and amoebic perforation of the bowel were difficult and therefore all patients with 'acute abdomen' had proctosigmoidoscopy and a trial of metronidazole for 24-48 h before laparotomy. At laparotomy, adhesive wraps were present in all patients; 13 perforations were exposed by inadvertent disturbance of adhesive wraps but were successfully closed by suture to any available organ in close proximity, such as the omentum or small bowel. Four patients (9 per cent) died after phase 1 surgery. After 6 weeks when the acute disease had healed, 33 of the remaining 41 patients (80 per cent) required closure of ileostomy only, five had resection of stricture and three (7 per cent) needed stricturoplasty (phase 2 surgery). Two patients (5 per cent) died after phase 2 surgery. Thus, in surgery for transmural amoebic colitis adhesive wraps should not be disturbed as they mechanically protect the peritoneal cavity from faecal soiling when perforation occurs. The colon should be emptied by lavage and the faecal stream diverted to avoid secondary bacterial effects.\r"

The endoprosthesis was removed and another inserted in one patient and the other underwent surgery. Both thereafter made uncomplicated recoveries. Jaundice subsequently recurred in eight patients and further endoscopic treatment was successful in five of these patients. Eleven patients died between 4 days and 23 months after the sphincterotomy with a median survival of 12 months. Four patients remain alive between 3 and 17 months after treatment.

The involved apical node carried the worst prognosis. Either the internal mammary node or a low axillary node when positive alone carried the same prognostic weight. When both nodes were positive the prognosis declined to the level associated with apical node positivity. A double node biopsy of the low axillary node and either the apical or the internal mammary node gave the same maximum prognostic information as a triple node biopsy. The triple node biopsy technique can be used to divide patients into groups with vastly different prognoses.\r"

  ".W": "In 49 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured with a recently developed immunoradiometric assay, and midregional PTH fragments (sequence 44-68) were measured with an established radioimmunoassay technique. In 47 normal subjects, the concentration of intact PTH ranged from 2.0 to 6.8 pmol/l, and in 49 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism it ranged from 6.4 to 80.0 pmol/l. In contrast, midregional PTH fragments were normal in seven of 49 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In five healthy controls and in 12 patients with surgically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism and serum calcium levels below 3.0 mmol/l, a rapid calcium loading test was performed. In healthy controls, intact PTH was in the low normal to subnormal range within 2.5-5.0 min, and had recovered within 15 min of calcium infusion. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the calcium infusion also led to a 30-50 per cent decrease in intact PTH levels within 5.0-7.5 min after injection, with a slow recovery after 10-15 min. In six of the patients with only slightly elevated basal intact PTH, a suppression to the normal range was observed. In 24 patients (16 patients with a solitary adenoma and eight patients with four-gland hyperplasia) the intact PTH levels were followed intraoperatively during parathyroidectomy, revealing a significantly different rate of decline for single adenomas compared with hyperplasia during the first 15 min after removal of the primary enlarged gland. Intact PTH values remained constantly elevated in one patient with primary hyperparathyroidism and an unsuccessful neck exploration. These results confirm that (a) the measurement of intact PTH in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is superior to the measurement of midregional fragments; (b) PTH secretion in primary hyperparathyroidism is not totally autonomous; and (c) intraoperative monitoring of intact PTH values could be used to monitor the success of surgery.\r"

At rest, means(s.d.) common femoral artery volume flow in normal subjects (344(135) ml/min) and all patients with peripheral vascular disease (401(168) ml/min) was not significantly different.

Common femoral artery volume flow in patients with critical ischaemia and intermittent claudication did not differ at rest but mean(s.d.) peak flow in patients with critical ischaemia (697(276) ml/min) was significantly lower than in claudicants (1131(447) ml/min) (P less than 0.01).

However, this difference did not persist during postocclusive reactive hyperaemia. A hyperaemic index, calculated from the hyperaemic responses to below knee and whole limb ischaemia, was used to quantify segmental perfusion during postocclusive reactive hyperaemia. The mean(s.d.) value in normal subjects, 46(9) per cent, and in those with aortoiliac disease, 52(12) per cent, indicated approximately equal perfusion of the above and below knee limb segments. In those with femoropopliteal disease the mean(s.d.) hyperaemic index was 17(13) per cent, revealing relative hypoperfusion of the below knee segment.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-seven patients underwent aortoiliac endarterectomy over an 11-year period, the majority (86 per cent) for disabling claudication. No patient died within 30 days of surgery, but nine patients suffered significant complications. The cumulative survival rate was 98 per cent at 1 year, and was 94 and 78 per cent at 5 and 10 years respectively. Cumulative operated segment patency rates were 92 per cent at 5 years and 68 per cent at 10 years. There was no significant difference in survival rates between patients who smoked after surgery and those who did not, but smokers had significantly worse rates for cumulative patency, limb failure and symptom status than non-smokers. Twenty-seven patients developed worsening symptoms during follow-up and 24 patients required secondary vascular intervention. Fourteen patients subsequently required aortofemoral bypass and the largest single cause of operated segment failure was recurrent disease in the external iliac artery. Our evidence suggests that, while aortoiliac endarterectomy should be considered in young patients with localized disease not involving the external iliac artery, those who do not fit these criteria should be considered for primary aortofemoral bypass. Regardless of the choice of operation, the chance of success is jeopardized if the patient continues to smoke.\r"

Seven patients had aneurysmal and two had occlusive aortic disease in association with unilateral (four cases) or bilateral (five cases) atheromatous renal artery stenosis. The indications for renal revascularization were hypertension (n = 8) refractory to medical treatment or associated with renal functional impairment and chronic renal failure alone (n = 1). Five patients developed postoperative complications with one fatality. Eight patients were followed up for between 7 months and 4 years. Control of blood pressure had improved in six of seven hypertensive patients. Serum creatinine levels were stabilized or had fallen in five patients. Simultaneous aortic and renal artery reconstruction is widely recognized as having a high postoperative morbidity rate but can improve control of hypertension and stabilize renal function in carefully selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that undernutrition may contribute to the reduction in plasma fibronectin concentration and the depression of the reticuloendothelial (RE) system associated with severe sepsis. We have investigated the effects of fasting, surgical trauma and sepsis on plasma fibronectin concentrations and RE function. In experiment 1, plasma fibronectin was measured in rabbits (n = 14) before and 48 h after fasting. In experiment 2, sepsis was induced by devascularization of the appendix in animals on a normal diet (sepsis group, n = 7). A third group of animals underwent only a laparotomy (laparotomy only group, n = 7). Plasma fibronectin concentrations and the blood clearance and organ distribution of 99mtechnetium tin colloid (TTC) were measured 24 h after operation. Compared with pooled reference plasma, fasting in experiment 1 resulted in a reduction in mean(s.e.m.) plasma fibronectin concentration from 98(1.5) per cent to 86(3.7) per cent (T = 2, P less than 0.005). Mean(s.e.m.) plasma fibronectin concentration was raised in the sepsis group to 117(4.6) per cent, compared with 97(2.5) per cent in the laparotomy only group (U = 5, P less than 0.02), but there was no such increase in the fasting and sepsis group. There was a delay in the blood clearance and reduced hepatic uptake of TTC in both sepsis groups. The dissociation between fibronectin concentrations and RE function in animal models of sepsis casts doubt on the importance of fibronectin in RE function.\r"

Sixty trauma patients were followed serially and divided into three groups: those with an uneventful recovery (n = 17), those with recovery after major sepsis (n = 27) and those who died (n = 16). The ability of peripheral blood monocytes to express the antigen HLA-DR was measured and compared to the results from 77 asymptomatic volunteers. After initial injury, there was a significant reduction from normal in the three trauma groups. It took one week for HLA-DR antigen expression to return to the normal range in the first group, three weeks in the second group, and in the third group it never returned to normal. Monocyte HLA-DR antigen expression, after incubation with lipopolysaccharide, distinguished those patients who survived from those who died. There was no difference in HLA-DR antigen expression between a high transfusion group of 31 patients who received 10 or more units of blood and a low transfusion group of 29 patients who received less than 10 units. The ability of monocytes to express HLA-DR antigen correlated directly with the clinical course in these patients and its measurement identified a group of patients at high risk of infection and death following trauma.\r"

  ".W": "The sartorius muscle was transposed into the abdominal cavity of six dogs, passed around a Thiry-Vella loop and sutured to itself to form a neosphincter. The muscle was activated by electrical stimulation and on contraction the neosphincter stopped or reduced the flow of saline through the Thiry-Vella loop in all animals until the onset of muscle fatigue. Continuous low frequency stimulation was used to transform the skeletal muscle, and when studied after a mean of 8 weeks of stimulation (range 6-11 weeks) the neosphincter stopped the flow for a significantly longer period of time (P = 0.027). Associated with the improved neosphincter function was a significant decrease in the fusion frequency (P = 0.003) and prolongation of the stimulus-peak tension time as assessed by a strain gauge sutured to the neosphincter muscle (P = 0.002). The changes in the contraction properties of the skeletal muscle suggest that continuous low frequency stimulation transformed the muscle fibres from type 2 to type 1, resulting in improved fatigue resistance and potential for continuous sphincter activity.\r"

  ".W": "This study assesses the perforation rate of single and double gloves and thus the extent to which double gloving protects the surgeon from diseases transmissible from the patient. We have also investigated whether double gloving offers the patient extra protection by reducing wound sepsis. Two hundred adult hernia repairs were performed, the first 100 single gloved and the second 100 double gloved. Glove perforation rates were not significantly different between single gloves and the outer of the double gloves. Although 46 of 400 outer gloves were perforated there were only 15 inner glove perforations and only eight of these matched the outer perforations. The percentage of operations in which the latex protective barrier was breached was reduced from 31 per cent when the surgeon wore single gloves to 8 per cent with double gloves. Wound sepsis was not increased by glove perforation nor reduced by double gloving. While careful technique remains mandatory we conclude that double gloving offers increased protection to the surgeon operating on high risk infectious cases.\r"

The learning activities are spread over an academic year so that the teachers are able to continue their clinical or research duties. The program, which follows a model of systematic instruction, comprises 17 self-instructional modules on basic educational topics adapted to medical teaching. The topics are related to four components of an integrated system: student needs and learning objectives, instructional methods, student evaluation and program evaluation. The instructional format is aimed at three levels--understanding, analysis and application--to which assignments and assessments are related. In addition to the modules, the program offers 15 half-day sessions for small groups (five participants and one instructor) to discuss aspects of the program, especially home assignments and the application of personal educational projects. A minimum of 100 hours of personal time is requested. The program's main goal is that students be placed at the centre of the educational process. Of 215 participants since 1979, 171 (80%) have completed the program and reported high satisfaction. Issues related to any faculty development program are discussed.\r"

By March 31, 1989, ten patients (6.3%) had survived for 5 years or more after the initial chemotherapy, including nine of 95 patients (9.5%) with limited disease and one of 64 patients (1.6%) with extensive disease. All these 5-year disease-free survivors, except for one patient whose response could not be assessed by chest radiograph because of radiation fibrosis, had a complete response. Nine of the 71 patients (12.7%) treated with combination regimens containing doxorubicin survived 5 years or more, and only one of the 88 (1.1%) treated with regimens without doxorubicin had long-term survival (P less than 0.01). The sex, performance status (PS), and chest radiation after systemic chemotherapy did not correlate statistically with long-term survival (P greater than 0.05). Three of the ten patients died free of SCLC. Two of the ten patients (20%) developed second malignancies and died. The remaining patient died of pneumonia. The Cox regression analysis identified the PS and doxorubicin-containing regimens as important factors indicating improved survival. Combination regimens containing doxorubicin have, therefore, been found to be very effective in improving survival and achieving long-term survival.\r"

Patients with residual resectable disease underwent surgery after induction therapy, whereas those achieving a complete response to induction did not require surgery. Patients on the two treatment arms were equivalent in all measured variables, including disease extent. Toxicities of the SIM and SEQ arms also were equivalent except for mucositis and the resultant weight loss, which were more severe on the SIM arm (P = 0.002). With a follow-up time ranging from 9 to 41 months, seven of the 24 SIM patients and 14 of the 24 SEQ patients are considered treatment failures. The relapse-free survival is significantly better on the SIM arm (P = 0.03), although an overall survival advantage has not yet been demonstrated (P = 0.13). The achievement of a complete response after induction therapy correlates with both the relapse-free (P = 0.0005) and overall (P = 0.05) survival, and the likelihood of an induction complete response also is significantly better for those treated with the SIM schedule (P = 0.02). Eighteen patients did not require surgery after achieving an induction complete response. Relapse-free survival does not appear to be compromised in this patient subset.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with cytarabine (3 g/m2 intravenously [IV] during 3 hours) after IV bolus cisplatin (100 mg/m2 repeated every 3 weeks). Aside from nausea and vomiting, the principal toxicity was hematologic, with Grade IV myelosuppression in 32% and Grade III in 14%. Four patients died while on study. One complete and four partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 14%. Responses were limited to lymph node and lung metastases and occurred in two of 17 adenocarcinomas, two of 12 squamous cell carcinomas, and one of eight large cell carcinomas. At this dose, the plasma level of cisplatin is only 3 micrograms/ml and the plasma level of cytarabine is 10 to 50 micrograms/ml, compared with the levels of 10 micrograms/ml and 1000 micrograms/ml, respectively, required for in vitro synergy. The severity of myelotoxicity observed indicates that, even at these levels, cisplatin enhances cytarabine activity. The combination may prove useful in malignancies that are sensitive to cytarabine, but is not of benefit in cytarabine-resistant malignancies such as NSCLC.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred eight patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (high and intermediate grade) were treated with a new protocol: continuous cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP). They were evaluated for long-term survival and pretreatment characteristics predictive of response and survival. Continuous CHOP protocol consists of initial 8 weeks of intensive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone, followed by local/cranial radiotherapy and maintenance therapy. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 84 of 108 (78%) patients; seven (6%) had a moderate response and 17 (16%) had a poor response. A statistically significant difference in CR rate was found only in patients with different stages. Seventeen of 84 (20%) complete responders have had a relapse of the disease. The median survival has not been reached. Results show an actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) of 77% for the 84 patients who had a complete response. The overall survival for all patients was 53% at 5 years of follow-up. The difference in DFS at the end of 5 years between different stages, main histologic subgroups, and age groups was not statistically significant. The toxicity observed was acceptable. Thus continuous CHOP appears to be an effective protocol for the treatment of intermediate-grade and high-grade lymphomas.\r"

The authors investigated whether HDC was associated with an acquired platelet defect. Platelet aggregation and release were evaluated after HDC in ten patients with either metastatic breast carcinoma or melanoma. Platelets underwent shape change and a primary wave of aggregation. High-dose chemotherapy was associated with the inhibition of secondary aggregation of platelets induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) analog (U44619), and collagen. Although electron microscopic study of the platelets revealed normal morphologic features with an adequate number of dense bodies and alpha-granules, release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from dense granules was less than 20% of normal. The acquired platelet defect occurred before development of thrombocytopenia. Aggregation of platelets from normal volunteers was not inhibited by either the addition of the chemotherapeutic agents, chemotherapy metabolites, or the patients' sera. In conclusion, HDC induces an acquired abnormality in platelet secretion and aggregation which may contribute to the development of hemorrhagic complications after ABMT.\r"

In a rat model doxorubicin was injected intradermally in declining concentrations and the minimal detectable concentration was found to be 0.02 mg/ml. Skin necrosis developed in rats injected with doxorubicin concentrations ranging from 0.02 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml. Clinically, fluorescence microscopic analysis of frozen sections was used in eight patients to assess whether doxorubicin or epirubicin extravasation had taken place. When all fluorescing tissue was removed, no necrosis ensued, but in one patient, where a slightly fluorescing area was ignored, necrosis developed later and excision of the tissue had to be performed.\r"

The original neoplasm had dense proliferation of small round cells with abundant glycogen content and numerous Homer-Wright rosettes. The culture showed proliferation of small spindle cells with uniform oval nuclei and slender cytoplasmic processes. When the culture reached maximum density, rosette-like structures similar to those in the original tumor were formed. Under the influence of N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid (dibutyryl cAMP), the cultured cells expressed these rosette-like structures even in the lower cell concentration. Electron microscopy revealed that the cultured cells treated with dibutyryl cAMP contained high-density granules, well-developed microtubules, and abundant 10-nm filaments. By immunocytochemistry, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and N-myc oncogene product were detected in the cultured cells as well as the original tumor. These results indicated the neuroectodermal origin of some of the small round cell tumors of bone.\r"

Although DI was not found to be related to the histology of the sarcomas, it was associated with malignancy grade, i.e., 14%, 25%, 42%, and 86% of benign, Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, respectively had a DI greater than 1. The relevance of aneuploidy in benign tumors is discussed and the literature reviewed. A subgroup of the malignant tumors (n = 13) had both a low mitotic score and a low Ki-67 value. However, a distinct correlation between Ki-67 and the mitotic score could not be shown. For malignant tumours G1PF was related to DI, i.e., low G1PF occurred in tumors with diploid DNA content. Low Ki-67 scores were observed in 59% of diploid tumors and in 20% of aneuploid tumors. However, it appeared that G1PF and Ki-67 were not correlated. In conclusion, (1) benign and Grade 1 tumors were predominantly diploid with high G1PF and low Ki-67 values, (2) most of Grade 3 tumors were aneuploid (86%) with low G1PF and high Ki-67 values, and (3) the group of Grade 2 tumors could be divided into two subgroups either with the characteristics displayed by benign and Grade 1 tumors (DI = 1, low Ki-67 scores, and high G1PF) or with the characteristics exhibited by Grade 3 tumors (DI greater than 1, high Ki-67 scores, and low G1PF). Hence, supplementary to the grading of soft tissue tumors, DI, G1PF, and Ki-67 score could be useful as prognostic parameters in soft tissue tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The nuclear DNA content of paraffin-embedded parathyroid tumors from 49 patients with proven primary hyperparathyroidism was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The lesions included 14 primary and 11 locally recurrent or metastatic lesions from 16 carcinoma patients, 28 single adenomas from 28 patients, and 15 hyperplastic glands from five patients with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. No abnormal DNA stemline was found in any of the hyperplastic glands. One (3.6%) of the adenomas was aneuploid. There was no difference in ploidy patterns between the primary and recurrent lesions of the carcinomas and five (31%) of the carcinomas expressed aneuploidy. Four of the five patients with aneuploid carcinoma had recurrences including pulmonary metastases. One of them died of this disease 12 years after the initial operation, and all except one of the others are hypercalcemic even after removal of the successive recurrent or metastatic tumors. Of the 11 patients with diploid carcinoma, four had either local recurrence or pulmonary metastasis. Two of them are living with normocalcemia 3 and 6 years, respectively, after removal of the recurrent tumors and the others are alive with mild hypercalcemia. The remaining seven patients with diploid carcinoma, however, have no recurrence 2 to 5 years after the initial operation. Thus aneuploid parathyroid carcinomas are likely to show more malignant behavior than those with a diploid DNA pattern. All of the patients with adenoma and hyperplasia have been normocalcemic after a mean follow-up interval of 37 months. This study indicates that flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content is a valuable adjunct to histologic examination in the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma and the prediction of the clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "A system of histologic grade of malignancy in human breast carcinoma was devised by significantly modifying the way of evaluating number of mitoses and architectural atypia in the histologic grading of Bloom and Richardson. The modified grading system was applicable to all histologic subtypes of adenocarcinoma and showed a good association with prognosis of breast carcinoma patients in retrospective analysis of 176 consecutive surgical cases (P less than 0.0001). Of the three components of histologic grade, architectural atypia and number of mitotic figures independently had a significant effect on the prognosis. The copy number of c-erbB-2, a prognostic factor independent of tumor size and nodal status, was strongly correlated with the histologic grade, number of mitotic figures, and degree of nuclear atypia (P less than 0.001, each). Cox's regression model analysis showed that nodal status and histologic grade were two determinants of prognosis, and the independent effect of c-erbB-2 amplification was absorbed within that of the histologic grade. Although the importance of c-erbB-2 gene copy number seemed to be inferior to that of the histologic grade, both were shown to be strongly associated with the aggressiveness of the tumor itself rather than the extent of tumor spread.\r"

There was a statistically significant Cox-Mantel test difference in the percentage survival curves of the patients, both in all stages (P less than 0.01) and in only Stages III and IV (P less than 0.05), as a function of the presence or absence of IM. Lymph node metastasis and distant organ metastasis were observed in 22 (91.7%) and seven (29.2%) of the 24 patients, respectively, with IM and in 111 (62.7%) and 13 (7.3%) of the 177 patients without IM. For both types of metastasis, the incidence was significantly lower in the patients without IM (P less than 0.01).

Tissue concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significantly higher in those precancerous lesions (CIBD: 61 +/- 11.2 ng/mg, adenoma: 70 +/- 6 ng/mg; mean +/- standard error of the mean) than in normal colonic mucosa (36 +/- 4.7 ng/mg). Colorectal carcinoma had still higher tissue levels (437 +/- 108.2 ng/mg). No correlation between tissue CEA and tumor differentiation could be found, but there was a significant difference between aneuploid (747 +/- 354 ng/mg) and diploid (139 +/- 43 ng/mg) tumors. Using flow cytometry DNA aneuploidy was present in 31.6%, 10.5%, and 51.6% of CIBD, colorectal adenoma, and carcinoma, respectively.

  ".W": "Fifty-nine colorectal carcinomas of patients with verified cancer family syndrome (CFS) were analyzed for DNA ploidy using flow cytometry. Sixty-eight percent of the tumors were diploid, and 32% were aneuploid. The aneuploid tumors had a median DNA index of 1.24 (range, 1.12-1.97). In 90% of all tumors the DNA index was less than 1.27. This predominance of diploid/near-diploid tumors was seen both in primary and in metachronous carcinomas. In 21 cases a cell cycle analysis was possible. Tumors with the S-phase fraction (SPF) greater than or equal to 9.8% had a worse prognosis than tumors with the SPF of less than 9.8%. These findings suggest that the predominance of diploid/near diploid DNA values is one of the characteristics of colorectal carcinomas in CFS. This might signify the existence of two or more pathogenetically different subgroups of colorectal carcinoma and explain the proposed better prognosis of colorectal carcinoma in CFS compared with other colorectal carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic value of the pretreatment serum CA 125, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in relation to tumor type, vascular invasion by tumor cells, and lymph node metastases was investigated in 77 patients with cervical adenocarcinoma. In Stage IB (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]), the five-year actuarial survival of patients with pretreatment serum CA 125 levels greater than 16 U/ml was 52.4% versus 95.6% when normal serum CA 125 levels were determined (P less than 0.01). Pretreatment serum SCC or CEA levels had no substantial prognostic value. In Stage IB (FIGO), 42% of the patients with elevated serum CA 125 levels had lymph node metastases versus 4% when normal levels were found (P = 0.012). The presence of vascular invasion (P = 0.01) or lymph node metastases (P = 0.001) was associated with an increased risk for recurrent disease. Adenosquamous tumors showed a higher incidence of vascular invasion (P = 0.05) and a higher incidence of elevated serum CA 125 levels (P = 0.03). Particularly in Stage II, adenosquamous tumors were found to have a poorer prognosis than adenocarcinomas (P = 0.0566). We conclude that in cervical adenocarcinoma serum CA 125 is an important prognostic factor and an implicit indicator of tumor virulence.\r"

  ".U": "90199678\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1987 12 patients with chondroblastoma underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA). There were eight female and four male patients (age range, 11-35 years) with lesions of the proximal humerus (three cases), distal femur (two cases), proximal tibia (two cases), proximal femur, distal tibia, talus, navicular bone, and fifth metacarpal (one case each). The radiologic features of the tumors were not entirely typical of chondroblastoma in the majority of patients. The aspirate was diagnosed as chondroblastoma in seven cases, was considered strongly suggestive of chondroblastoma in one case, was found to be diagnosable as chondroblastoma on review in one case, and was nondiagnostic in two cases. The remaining case, which showed giant cell tumor-like areas in addition to typical chondroblastoma on histologic sections from the curettage, was interpreted as giant cell tumor on FNA. There was no case in which an aspirate was erroneously diagnosed as chondroblastoma. On FNA, chondroblastoma had three dominant cytologic components: neoplastic mononuclear cells (chondroblasts), multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, and chondroid matrix fragments. The chondroblasts tended to lie individually in smears creating a pebbled appearance. They most commonly had round to oval nuclei with fine, evenly distributed chromatin and distinct longitudinal grooves, but indented, lobulated, and pyknotic nuclei were also observed. Their cytoplasm was dense and opaque with rounded well-defined borders. Multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells were randomly admixed and were indistinguishable from those seen in other bone neoplasms. Chondroid matrix stained magenta with the Diff-Quik stain and green to violet with Papanicolaou. The cytologic features of the chondroblasts are the diagnostic hallmark of chondroblastoma and may allow FNA to become a valuable preoperative technique in the management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Risk factors for local failure were evaluated for 496 clinical Stage I-II patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas (median follow-up, 71 months) treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy. Monofactorial analysis identified the following factors to be correlated with increased risk: moderate/marked mononuclear cell reaction (MCR), high histologic grade (G), extensive intraductal component (EIC), tumor necrosis, macroscopic multiplicity, estrogen receptor negativity, anatomic tumor size, age younger than 40 years, and vascular invasion. Only MCR, G, and EIC proved significant in Cox multivariate analysis. These risk factors were highly age dependent, with EIC markedly more prevalent in women younger than 50, MCR and G in women younger than 40. Separate Cox analysis for premenopausal patients showed that MCR/EIC determined risk independent of resection margins: tumors with MCR had a 28%, and with EIC a 22% probability of recurring locally by 5 years. Premenopausal patients with neither risk factor had a very low failure rate (2.6% at 5 years), regardless of age. For postmenopausal patients risk of breast recurrence was determined both by adequacy of resection margins and grade, with a high local failure rate for patients having G3 tumors with positive or indeterminate margins (31% at 5 years). The authors conclude that the microscopic examination is the only useful tool for assessing the risk of local failure, which is quite low for the majority of patients treated with breast conservation. High-risk patients can be recognized morphologically. The age dependence of morphologic risk factors appears to explain the high local failure rate seen in patients younger than 40.\r"

Twenty-four patients had poor left ventricular function (EF less than 40%), and coronary dilatation was performed in arteries opposite to an occluded myocardial necrosis related vessel. In three patients of advanced age with distal stenoses and normal left ventricular function a multivessel dilatation was performed. Primary success rate was achieved in all patients. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions or emergency bypass operations in the hospitalization period. During the follow-up (9 to 21 months) there were 2 deaths, 1 cardiac transplantation, and 6 restenosis with repeated dilatation. If revascularization is warranted, in high-risk patients, coronary angioplasty can be performed safely and successfully with protection by intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. However the long-term prognosis of these patients is complicated by the presence of other high-risk variables, such as advanced age or poor left ventricular function.\r"

Each of the three groups was divided into two subgroups. In the early cases, balloon catheters with diameter 10-20% exceeding pulmonary valve annulus were used and the drop of the gradient was 39.5%. In the later cases, balloon diameters 30-40% greater than the valve anulus or double balloons were used and a drop of 66.7% in the RV-PA pressure gradient was achieved. The dilation in patients with dysplastic valve and residual stenosis after surgical valvotomy for PAIS was less effective. Doppler echocardiography was the technique used to evaluate residual gradient. Six months to 4 years follow-up demonstrated a persistent decrease of the valve gradient.\r"

However, only 36% of patients had lesion recurrence with or without new disease, and 64% showed evidence of disease progression with symptoms. Angiographic and clinical success was achieved in 42 patients undergoing second PTA (96%). These data indicate that balloon angioplasty can be successfully utilized in patients with symptomatic obliterative disease of the tibioperoneal vessels with excellent success, a low risk of complications, and good clinical improvement. PTA of the below-knee vessels should not be restricted to patients in limb salvage situations.\r"

In the turntable experiments, the flow away from the catheter tip (away flow) was significantly lower than that toward the catheter (toward flow), but the measured velocities for both away and toward flows were always lower than the known velocities. Nevertheless, the blood velocities measured at a sampling point 4 mm from the catheter tip showed excellent correlation with the known velocities irrespective of flow direction. The shape of the FFT spectra of the Doppler shift frequency from blood was broadened, and the frequency corresponding to the known velocity was always close to the maximum Doppler shift frequency. We concluded that zero-cross detection of blood velocity by the 20-MHz pulsed Doppler catheter provides a reliable measure for evaluating relative velocity changes, although it underestimates the blood velocity.\r"

Calcium overload during reoxygenation, mediated in part by Na-Ca exchange and supported by the rise in cell sodium during hypoxia, may be one factor. The effects of amiloride (0.1 mM), a diuretic that inhibits Na(+)-H+ and Na-Ca exchanges in cardiac sarcolemma and mitochondria preparations, were studied during hypoxia-reoxygenation in the isovolumic, isolated rat heart. During hypoxia, cell sodium, measured using potassium ethylenediamine tetraacetate cobaltate as an extracellular marker, increased in amiloride and amiloride-free hearts, but there was no increase in cell calcium (3.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.9 mumol/g dry wt; p = NS). Amiloride did not alter developed pressure (DP), end-diastolic pressure (EDP), pH, or integrated areas of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) (determined by phosphorus-31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) during hypoxia or normal perfusion conditions. Forty minutes after reoxygenation, however, cell calcium was significantly lower in the amiloride (5.1 +/- 1.3 mumol/g dry wt) than in the amiloride-free group (10.4 +/- 1.8 mumol/g dry wt; p less than 0.001), and there was improved recovery of DP (percent of initial) (72 +/- 12% vs. 41 +/- 12%; p less than 0.001), PCr (99 +/- 9% vs. 70 +/- 14%; p less than 0.001), and pH (7.17 +/- 0.17 vs. 6.88 +/- 0.16; p less than 0.001) in the amiloride group. To determine whether this dose of amiloride inhibits the manifestations of sodium-mediated calcium gain in the same model during normoxia, the metabolic and functional sequelae of lithium-substituted low sodium (50 mM) perfusion were studied. Amiloride significantly limited the manifestations of sodium-mediated calcium gain as indexed (all expressed as percent of control) by a lower peak DP (221 +/- 25% vs. 284 +/- 20%) at 3 minutes, improved preservation of PCr (85 +/- 10% vs. 68 +/- 9%) and ATP (104 +/- 12% vs. 84 +/- 9%), lower rise in inorganic phosphate (201 +/- 74% vs. 332 +/- 106%), and a smaller fall in intracellular pH (7.01 +/- 0.04 vs. 6.70 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05) for all metabolic parameters during a 20-minute period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Deduction of these electrical events is possible from measured epicardial potentials, and, thus, a noninvasive method of recovering epicardial potentials from body surface data is useful in experimental and clinical studies. In the present study, an inverse method that uses Tikhonov regularization was shown to reconstruct, with good accuracy, important events in cardiac excitation. The inverse procedure was employed on data obtained from a human-torso tank in which a beating canine heart was placed in the correct anatomical position. Comparison with the actual, measured epicardial potentials indicates that positions and shapes of potential features (maxima, minima, zero potential line, saddles, etc.) are recovered with good accuracy throughout the QRS. An error in position of up to 1 cm is typical, while amplitudes are slightly diminished. In addition, application was extended from the above setting, in which the geometry was precisely known and potentials at a large number of leads were measured accurately, to a situation that is more representative of clinical and experimental settings. Effects of inaccuracy in location of the position of the heart were examined. A stylized torso that approximates the actual geometry was designed, and its performance in the inverse computations was evaluated. A systematic method of reduction of the number of leads on the body surface was proposed, and the resulting lead configurations were evaluated in terms of the accuracy of inverse solutions. The results indicate that the inverse problem can be stabilized with respect to different types of uncertainties in measured data and offer promise in the use of the inverse procedure in clinical and experimental situations.\r"

In this study, we examined the potential relation between production of reactive oxygen species and cyclooxygenase-derived autacoids by studying the effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) on the rise in thromboxane formation observed with myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Immunoreactive thromboxane B2 was measured in cardiac lymph from conscious dogs during reperfusion after a 60-minute occlusion in the presence of infusions of SOD alone, CAT alone, and a combination of SOD and CAT. Reperfusion after 60 minutes of ischemia causes an immediate elevation in thromboxane B2. SOD and CAT infusion prevented this rise in thromboxane B2 as did infusion of SOD alone. The ability of SOD-CAT to suppress thromboxane B2 production dissipated within 3 hours after the cessation of infusion, at which time thromboxane B2 excretion increased. The modulation of fatty acid oxygenases by reactive oxygen species may be a very important pathogenic factor in considering the origin of the protective effect of antioxidants in the setting of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"

It was found that atherosclerotic plaques and wall thickenings in left and right coronary arteries were localized almost exclusively on the outer wall of one or both daughter vessels at major bifurcations and T-junctions, which left the flow-divider free of lesions, and along the inner wall of curved segments. When flow patterns in such vessels were studied in detail, it was discovered that these sites were where flow was either slow or disturbed with the formation of slow recirculation and secondary flows and where wall shear stress was low. The results indicate that the major hemodynamic factors directly related to the localization of atherosclerotic plaques and wall thickenings in the human arterial system are the low fluid velocity and the resultant low shear stress that acts on the vessel wall.\r"

  ".W": "It is uncertain whether the shift of cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) during pressure overload can be induced by some intrinsic factors or by the stress imposed directly on the individual myocytes. To study whether the changes in cardiac MHC gene expression produced by one-sided overload are limited to the involved ventricle or extend to the other ventricle, we examined MHC gene expression and isozyme transition in the left and right ventricles in aortic coarctated and pulmonary artery-banded rats. It has been confirmed that the pressure overload is indeed limited to the loaded ventricle. The results showed that, compared with sham-operated rats, there was no significant induction of the beta-MHC messenger RNA and corresponding protein in the unloaded ventricle, whereas significant induction was observed in the overloaded ventricle. These results demonstrated that the changes in MHC gene expression and isozyme produced by one-sided ventricular overload are limited to the involved ventricle. We conclude that the MHC gene regulation during hemodynamic overload may not be induced by intrinsic factors, such as hormones, catecholamine, or atrial natriuretic peptide, but is induced by direct local response to increased load.\r"

Pure cultures of microvascular and macrovascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, vascular pericytes, and several nonvascular cell lines were tested for junctional communication by fluorescent dye transfer. All of the vascular wall cells were capable of dye transfer. Since gap junctions are formed by a family of related proteins (connexins) whose unique domains may confer physiological regulatory properties, we tested total RNA from these cultures by Northern blot analysis for expression of the currently available, characterized, and cloned mammalian gap junction proteins: connexin26, connexin32, and connexin43. All of the vascular wall cells expressed connexin43 messenger RNA. Connexin43 was expressed in vascular cells from bovine, porcine, rat, and human sources. Several nonvascular cell lines of mesenchymal origin also expressed connexin43 messenger RNA. When high stringency Northern blots were used, messenger RNAs for connexin32 or connexin26 were not detected in any of the vascular wall cells but were expressed in several cell lines of epithelial origin. Freshly isolated and purified aortic endothelial and smooth muscle RNA preparations similarly contained only connexin43 messenger RNA, excluding the possibility of culture-induced alterations in gene expression. The expression of connexin43 by all vascular wall cells may provide a mechanism for the functional integration of the vessel wall by gap junctions.\r"

  ".W": "The electrocardiogram is the graphic representation against time of the difference in potential between points of the body caused by the current field of the heart. To examine the origin of this current field, a method of transforming body surface electrocardiographic data to the epicardial surface has been developed. The computed epicardial current density distributions in 219 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction showed that, in 89% of patients, the current flow out of the heart during the ST segment came from two regions, not only from the infarction region but also from a region over the great vessels. This findings suggests that current flows from the ischemic region, through the low-resistance pathway provided by the intracavity blood, out the great vessels, and back to the epicardium. A similar pathway has been hypothesized when ischemia caused endocardial ST elevation, such as during a stress test or with unstable angina. To test this hypothesis, a group of patients with ST depression on the 12-lead electrocardiogram, not associated with ST elevation, was examined with body surface mapping. Ninety-four percent of patients had epicardial current density distributions that showed a region of current flow out of the heart and over the great vessels that was consistent with this hypothesis. This could explain the poor localization of coronary artery disease by electrocardiographic techniques when there is ST depression on the body surface.\r"

One cell of the pair was voltage-clamped with a single-patch pipette, and gj was measured after the perforation of the nonjunctional membrane of the partner cell. The current-voltage relation of gj was linear between -30 and +30 mV. The control gj at 5.0 mM ATP in 88 pairs of cells ranged from 100 to 1,055 nS (average, 268 nS). ATP within the range from 0.1 to 5.0 mM increased gj in a dose-dependent manner. The Hill coefficient was 2.6, and the half-maximum effective concentration of ATP was 0.68 mM. Adenylylimidodiphosphate (2 mM) caused a transient increase in gj in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, but forskolin (30 microM), cyclic AMP (50 microM), catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (1 microM), and ADP (10 mM) had no significant effect on gj. The temperature coefficient of gj in the presence of 5.0 mM ATP was 1.29. These findings suggest that gj in paired ventricular myocytes is directly regulated by ATP probably through a specific ligand-receptor interaction between ATP and gap junctional channel protein.\r"

Ring segments from the aortic arch and thoracic aorta were mounted in organ chambers for isometric tension recording and measurement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. WHHL rabbits were divided into three groups according to age: group 1, 3-5 months; group 2, 6-9 months; and group 3, 12-14 months. Atherosclerotic changes (expressed as a percent of total surface area) in the aortic arches in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 11 +/- 3% (mild), 28 +/- 6% (moderate), and 54 +/- 8% (severe) respectively; only occasional plaques were present in the thoracic aorta in all groups. Maximal contractions elicited with phenylephrine progressively decreased with increasing degrees of atherosclerotic plaque. Contractions evoked by histamine were augmented in all groups of WHHL rabbits when compared with controls, whereas those to serotonin were augmented only in vessels with mild atherosclerosis. As the severity of the intimal lesions increased, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, ATP, and calcium ionophore A23187 progressively decreased. Endothelium-independent relaxation to nitroglycerin was virtually complete in all segments. However, vessels with severe atherosclerosis were less sensitive to this agent as illustrated by a significant increase in the ED50 value. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a predominant loss of endothelial cells in the central regions of fibrous plaques. Thus, in WHHL rabbits, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis result in an increased responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to histamine and serotonin. Endothelium-mediated relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is reduced with the progression of atherosclerosis primarily due to a loss of endothelial cells.\r"

Cardiac enlargement was produced by placing a constricting band (0.024-inch diameter) around the ascending aorta of 25-day-old animals, which resulted in progressively increased stenosis as the rat matured. A 57% and 77% cardiac hypertrophy was observed at 2 and 8 weeks, respectively, with signs of congestive failure at the latter time point. Myosin isoform expression was examined in the subendocardial and subepicardial myocardium of the left ventricle and the free wall of the right ventricle by use of native gel electrophoresis. The percentage of the V3 isoform increased dramatically in both ventricles. In the subendocardial myocardium of the left ventricle, expression of the V3 isoform increased (p less than or equal to 0.05) relative to the subepicardial myocardium at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (17.1% vs. 10.2%, 29.4% vs. 18%, and 46.6% vs. 36.2%). In addition to regional differences within a given transmural segment, we also observed a high degree of heterogeneity in myosin isoform expression throughout a given layer (particularly the subendocardial myocardium) when small (less than or equal to 10-15 mg) adjacent samples were examined. This variability illustrated a potential danger in interpretation of gel results obtained from a single small tissue sample. Thus, cardiac hypertrophy produced by pressure overload in 25-day-old rats resulted in significantly increased V3 myosin in both the left and right ventricles. Furthermore, within the hypertrophied left ventricle, the subendocardial myocardium contained a significantly greater percentage of V3 myosin than the subepicardial myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the hypothesis that stunning swine myocardium with brief ischemia reduces oxygen demand in the stunned region and increases tolerance of myocardium to longer periods of ischemia. Wall function was quantified with ultrasonic crystals aligned to measure wall thickening, and stunning was achieved with two cycles of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion (10 minutes) and reperfusion (30 minutes), after which the LAD was occluded for 60 minutes and reperfused for 90 minutes. Infarct size (as a percent of risk region) was then determined by incubating myocardium with para-nitro blue tetrazolium. Regional oxygen demand was measured as myocardial oxygen consumption before the 60-minute LAD occlusion in the stunned region; tracer microspheres were used to determine blood flow, and blood from the anterior interventricular vein and left atrium was used to calculate oxygen saturations. After the second reperfusion period, wall thickening in the stunned region was reduced to 1.4 +/- 2.4% compared with 36.7 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM) before ischemia (p less than 0.001). Regional myocardial oxygen consumption after stunning (3.1 +/- 0.7 ml O2/min/100 g) was no different from regional myocardial oxygen consumption before stunning (3.7 +/- 0.6 ml O2/min/100 g). In the nine pigs \"preconditioned\" by stunning, infarct size was 10.4 +/- 6.3% of the risk region compared with 48.0 +/- 12.7% in the six control pigs subjected to 60 minutes of ischemia without prior stunning (p less than 0.005). The risk regions were similar (14.4 +/- 1.5% vs. 14.6 +/- 1.9% of the left ventricle, preconditioned vs. control pigs, respectively). We conclude that stunning swine myocardium with two cycles of a 10-minute LAD occlusion followed by reperfusion increases ischemic tolerance but that changes in regional demand in stunned myocardium do not predict the marked reduction in infarct size that follows a subsequent 60-minute period of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "We used left ventricular myocytes from adult rats to investigate the effect of 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and of sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC-8) on the membrane association of protein kinase C (PKC), cytosolic [Ca2+], (Cai) homeostasis, and the contractile properties of single cardiac cells. Because PKC activity is known to be highly Ca2+ sensitive, the K+ concentration of the bathing medium was raised from 5 to 30 mM in some experiments, a perturbation known to depolarize the cell and increase Cai. In cell suspensions both PMA (3 x 10(-10) and 3 x 10(-7) M) and DiC-8 (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) increased membrane association of PKC. The effect of PMA (10(-7) M) on PKC translocation was enhanced in 30 mM KCl compared with 5 mM KCl. During steady field stimulation at 1 Hz in 1 mM bathing [Ca2+], both PMA (10(-7) M) and DiC-8 (10(-5) M) decreased twitch amplitude to approximately 60% of control in 5 mM KCl, and the negative inotropic effect of either drug was more pronounced in 30 mM KCl than in 5 mM KCl. In single cardiac myocytes loaded with the Ca2+ indicator indo-1 and bathed in 5 mM KCl, we simultaneously measured cell length and Cai. The myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+ was assessed by the relation between contraction amplitude and the peak of the Cai transient. The negative inotropic effect of both PMA and DiC-8 was related to a diminished amplitude of the Cai transient and not to a decreased myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+. In the absence of electrical stimulation, PMA (10(-7) M) and DiC-8 (10(-5) M) decreased the frequency of contractile waves due to spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and DiC-8 also decreased resting Cai. Thus, activation of PKC, which is thought to occur as part of the response of cardiac muscle to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation, is associated with a negative inotropic action due to a smaller Cai transient rather than to a decrease in the myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+. These effects on the membrane association of PKC and on contractility are enhanced by cell depolarization achieved by raising [KCl] in the bathing medium.\r"

At first, the [HEPES] was fixed at 5 mM; then, 2 minutes before reflow, either the [HEPES] was varied from 50 to 1 mM to slow H+o washout, or increasing concentrations of 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (Ki 7 microM) or 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (Ki 0.2 microM) were added for inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange. In each case, reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias were reduced by 69-73% (p less than 0.001).\r"

  ".W": "To define the relation between oxygen-derived free radical (oxy-radical) generation in the reperfused ischemic myocardium and the progression of myocardial damage, we measured oxy-radical generation in the ischemic myocardium and the propagating infarct size in a model of canine coronary occlusion (90 minutes) and reperfusion. We used electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping techniques (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide [DMPO]) to detect oxy-radicals in the rapidly frozen myocardial samples taken by needle biopsy. There was no detectable generation of DMPO adducts in the normal myocardium before or after reperfusion. In the reperfused ischemic myocardium, electron paramagnetic resonance signals of DMPO-OOH (superoxide anion) and DMPO-OH (hydroxyl radical) were detected, with peak concentrations at 1 hour after reperfusion for DMPO-OOH and at 3 hours after reperfusion for DMPO-OH, respectively. These DMPO adducts were also detected during the early phase (15 seconds) of reperfusion, but the concentrations of these signals were much less than those during the late phase of reperfusion. Treatment with human recombinant superoxide dismutase (2.5 mg/kg/hr) and catalase (2.5 mg/kg/hr) during the course of experiments abolished DMPO-OOH formation but had little effect on DMPO-OH formation. Infarct size (percent of risk area infarcted), quantified by a dual staining method with Evans blue dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride, was 18.3 +/- 4.8% (mean +/- SEM) at 90 minutes of occlusion. After 5 hours of reperfusion, infarct size increased to 43.6 +/- 7.2%. These results indicate that a greater magnitude of oxy-radical generation was sustained in the ischemic myocardial tissue during the late phase (1-3 hours) of reperfusion, associated with the progression of myocardial infarction. The concurrent appearance of oxy-radicals and progressive infarction may support the view that a chain reaction of oxy-radicals contributes to the propagation of myocardial cell damage in the postischemic heart.\r"

Native LDL was separated into two fractions by filtered tap-water dialysis, namely, water-soluble LDL (WS-LDL) and non-water-soluble LDL. Although native LDL did not enhance the platelet aggregability, WS-LDL made it markedly increased. WS-LDL consisted of the lipid constituents that were not found in native LDL. Namely, in thin-layer chromatography of WS-LDL, an unknown spot between triolein and free fatty acid was clearly stained. This unknown spot in the WS-LDL was produced by the peroxidation of cholesteryl ester in native LDL. It was confirmed that the spot has the same Rf value as the peroxidate of cholesteryl linolate in thin-layer chromatography. If native LDL is modulated by divalent metal ions and oxygen in the fluids, LDL with biological activity such as an increase of platelet aggregability is produced.\r"

Immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to visualize human cardiac innervation before and after transplantation. In the recipient heart cardiac nerve fibers and fascicles displayed immunoreactivity for general neural (protein gene product 9.5 and synaptophysin) and Schwann cell markers (S-100). A major proportion of cardiac nerves displayed neuropeptide tyrosine and tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence staining. Subpopulations of nerves contained somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P- or neurokinin-like immunoreactivity, and acetylcholinesterase activity. Tissues from cardiac allografts (5 weeks to 63 months after transplantation) contained nerves and ganglion cells that were acetylcholinesterase positive and immunoreactive for the general neural markers. These nerves were less numerous than in recipient hearts and rarely displayed neuropeptide immunostaining. Atrial natriuretic peptide immunoreactivity was localized to myocardial cells in transplanted hearts as well as explanted recipient and postmortem hearts. While most human cardiac allografts remain functionally extrinsically denervated, they appear to contain viable intrinsic nerves, and myocardial cells retain the capacity to produce atrial natriuretic peptide.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that preconditioning myocardium with four 5-minute episodes of ischemia and reperfusion dramatically limited the size of infarcts caused by a subsequent 40-minute episode of sustained ischemia. The current study was undertaken to assess whether the same preconditioning protocol slowed the loss of high energy phosphates, limited catabolite accumulation, and/or delayed ultrastructural damage during a sustained ischemic episode. Myocardial metabolites and ultrastructure in the severely ischemic subendocardial regions were compared between control and preconditioned canine hearts. Hearts (four to 10 per group) were excised after 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 minutes of sustained ischemia. All groups had comparable collateral blood flow. Preconditioned hearts developed ultrastructural injury more slowly than controls; evidence of irreversible injury was observed after 20 minutes in controls but not until 40 minutes in preconditioned hearts. Furthermore, after 40 minutes of ischemia, irreversible injury was homogeneous in controls but only focal in preconditioned myocardium. Preconditioning reduced starting levels of ATP by 29%. Nevertheless, it also slowed the rate of ATP depletion during the episode of sustained ischemia, so that after 10 minutes of ischemia, preconditioned hearts had more ATP than controls. However, after 40 minutes, ATP contents were not significantly different between groups. Preservation of ATP resulted from reduced ATP utilization and was not due to increased ATP production. Accumulation of purine nucleosides and bases (products of adenine nucleotide degradation) was limited in preconditioned myocardium. Accumulation of glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and lactate also was reduced markedly by preconditioning, due to reduced rates of glycogen breakdown and and anaerobic glycolysis. We propose that preconditioning reduces myocardial energy demand during ischemia, which results in a reduced rate of high energy phosphate utilization and a reduced rate of anaerobic glycolysis. Either preservation of ATP or reduction of the cellular load of catabolites may be responsible for delaying ischemic cell death.\r"

The range of wall shear rate was up to approximately 1,000 1/sec in venules and from 640 to 2,900 1/sec in arterioles. Platelet thrombus initiation occurred more rapidly at higher wall shear rate in venules and at lower wall shear rate in arterioles. Thrombus initiation time was shortest around a wall shear rate of 900 1/sec in venules and around 700 1/sec in arterioles. Thrombus growth rate in venules was greatest at a wall shear rate of 1,500-2,000 1/sec. Thrombus initiation and its relation to blood flow was also examined in branched and curved microvessels. In these vessels platelet thrombi were also first initiated at the sites of higher wall shear rate in venules and of lower wall shear rate in arterioles.\r"

Explant cultures of main pulmonary arteries were incubated with [3H]proline to measure collagen and protein synthesis and percent collagen synthesis. Elastin synthesis was measured by [14C]valine incorporation into insoluble elastin. Relative collagen synthesis increased twofold (from 1.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(3) to 2.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(3) disintegrations per minute [14C]hydroxyproline/vessel/hr/mg protein), relative collagen synthesis doubled (from 2% to 4-5% of total protein synthesis), and elastin synthesis increased ninefold (from 0.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) to 3.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(4) dpm [14C]valine/vessel/hr/mg protein) in early hypertension. The level of pro alpha l(I) collagen RNA paralleled the relative collagen synthetic rate during the study period. Within 7 days of recovery from hypoxia, collagen and elastin contents were normal. We conclude that collagen and elastin in main pulmonary arteries are synthesized rapidly during an episode of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and that collagen and elastin are rapidly removed from the hypertensive vessel during normoxic recovery.\r"

We demonstrated the early change in the translational activity of specific cardiac messenger RNA by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of in vitro translational products. A total of over 400 translational products were detected by fluorography, and the relative predominance of eight species was increased by pressure overload whereas that of two translational products was decreased. We cloned four pressure-overload-responsive complementary DNA clones, pPO-1, -4, -5, and -6, by differential dot blot hybridization. Two clones were increased from the early period after the imposition of pressure overload; the other two were decreased. The expression pattern of each complementary DNA clone in the pressure-overloaded hearts was similar to that in fetal hearts. Pressure overload also induced the additional messenger RNA, which hybridized with pPO-4. This mRNA was also recognized in fetal, neonatal, and adult spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts. The induction of this transcript by pressure overload was not suppressed but, rather, stimulated by cycloheximide. These results suggest that there are some genes that rapidly respond to pressure overload and that may play some role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".U": "90200102\r", 
  ".W": "Both systolic pressure-volume area (PVA) and force-time integral (FTI) have been used as measures of oxygen consumption per beat (VO2) in the isolated left ventricle. The reciprocal of the slope of the VO2-PVA relation has been considered to reflect the chemomechanical energy transduction efficiency of the contractile machinery (contractile efficiency), whereas its VO2 intercept consists of energy cost of excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism. To examine whether the increase in myosin isoform V1/V3 ratio in hyperthyroid rabbits decreases contractile efficiency and to determine overall mechanisms of higher oxygen consumption in hyperthyroid hearts, the VO2-PVA and VO2-FTI relations as well as the end-systolic pressure-volume relation were assessed in cross-circulated, isovolumically beating hearts isolated from normal, hyperthyroid, and hypothyroid rabbits. Normalized initial slopes of the rising limb of the curvilinearly fitted end-systolic pressure-volume relation (E'max, ventricular contractility index) were similar for normal and hyperthyroid groups. However, the slopes and VO2 intercepts of the VO2-PVA and VO2-FTI relations were greater in hyperthyroid hearts than in normal hearts. Accordingly, in the hyperthyroid hearts, the contractile efficiency (27 +/- 6%) was lower and left ventricular VO2 for excitation-contraction coupling (0.028 +/- 0.004 ml O2/beat/100 g) was higher than in normal hearts (40 +/- 4% and 0.021 +/- 0.005 ml O2/beat/100 g, respectively). This decreased contractile efficiency in the hyperthyroid hearts was attributable to myosin isoform alteration rather than to increased beta-adrenoceptors because isoproterenol did not affect the slope of the VO2-PVA relation in all groups. In contrast, the slope of the VO2-FTI relation was significantly increased by isoproterenol in all groups. Neither the VO2-PVA nor the VO2-FTI relations in hypothyroid hearts were different from those in normal hearts except for significantly lower VO2 for basal metabolism. We conclude that in hyperthyroid rabbits, the left ventricle has decreased contractile efficiency and increased energy cost of excitation-contraction coupling and that the decreased contractile efficiency in hyperthyroid hearts is probably due to the increased V1/V3 ratio of the myosin isoform component. In addition, this study demonstrates that the VO2-PVA and VO2-FTI relations dissociate depending on the intervention, even in the same isovolumic contraction mode.\r"

The procedure increased the mitral valve area (p less than 0.0001) and decreased the mitral gradient (p less than 0.0001). No AS was detected before PMV, but it was detected immediately after PMV. Oximetry identified AS in 17 patients (25%), and dilution curves identified AS in an additional 25 (total, 62%). The ratio of mean pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) was 1.31 +/- 0.2, and in six patients (9%), the ratio was 1.5 or greater. Among nine clinical, 20 hemodynamic, and six procedural variables, stepwise logistic regression analysis selected the following as independent predictors of AS: smaller increases in valve area (p = 0.01) after PMV, absence of previous surgical commissurotomy (p = 0.02), mitral valve calcification (p = 0.02), and smaller left atria (p = 0.06). Among the 33 patients recatheterized at 6 months, oximetry had detected AS in 10, and dilution curves detected AS in an additional nine (total, 58%) immediately after PMV. At 6 months, AS had decreased or disappeared in 14 of these patients (74%), had increased in three (16%), and was unchanged in two (10%). Overall, at 6 months, oximetry identified AS in three patients, and dilution curves identified AS in an additional 13 (total, 48%). AS was detected at 6 months in only three patients but was not detected immediately after PMV. Although AS is very frequent immediately after PMV, Qp/Qs is usually less than 1.5. The appearance of shunting correlates with patient characteristics and with less improvement in valve area after PMV. Atrial shunting usually persists at 6 months, but its severity almost always decreases.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the spectral components of RR interval variability under controlled respiration (15 breaths/min) in 56 patients (age range, 35-73 years) referred for coronary angiography; 14 patients had multivessel disease (group M), 21 had one-vessel disease (group S), and 21 had nonsignificant disease or normal coronary artery (group N). There were 43 healthy controls (age range, 36-71 years) (group C). The patients had no clinical evidence of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or acute stage of infarction and had taken no medication for 3 days. The autoregressive power spectral density of RR interval variability contains two major components, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) (0.25 Hz) and Mayer wave-like sinus arrhythmia (MWSA) (0.04-0.15 Hz), which have magnitudes that are quantitative markers of cardiac vagal activity and sympathetic activity with vagal modulation, respectively. We represented the magnitudes by the coefficient of component variance (CCV), which provided the amplitude relative to the mean RR interval. The age- and sex-adjusted mean of CCVRSA significantly decreased with advancing angiographic severity (1.64 +/- 0.09%, 1.66 +/- 0.12%, 1.22 +/- 0.13%, and 0.81 +/- 0.16% for groups C, N, S, and M, respectively) (p = 0.0001). The CCVRSA was unrelated to left ventricular function, previous myocardial infarction, or stenosis of any specific artery including the sinoatrial and atrioventricular node arteries. The CCVMWSA decreased only in group M (p = 0.0462). These results indicate that coronary artery disease is associated with vagal dominant impairment in autonomic cardiac function and that reduction in the vagal cardiac function correlates with the angiographic severity.\r"

  ".U": "90200111\r", 
  ".W": "Coronary vasomotion was studied at rest and during bicycle exercise with biplane quantitative coronary arteriography in 28 patients with coronary artery disease. Patients were divided into two groups; the first 18 patients served as controls (group 1), and the next 10 patients were treated with propranolol 0.1 mg/kg, which was infused intravenously before exercise (group 2). Luminal area of a normal and a stenotic vessel segment was determined at rest, during supine bicycle exercise, and 5 minutes after sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin after exercise. In group 1, the normal vessel showed vasodilation (+16%, p less than 0.001) during exercise, whereas the stenotic vessel segment showed vasoconstriction (-31%, p less than 0.001). After sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, there was coronary vasodilation of both normal (+36%, p less than 0.001 vs. rest) and stenotic (+20%, p less than 0.001) vessel segments. Patients with angina pectoris during supine exercise (n = 10) had significantly (p less than 0.05) more vasoconstriction (-36%) than patients without angina (-23%). In group 2, intravenous administration of propranolol at rest was associated with a decrease in luminal area of both normal (-24%, p less than 0.001) and stenotic (-43%, p less than 0.001) vessel segments; however, during subsequent exercise, both normal (-2%, p = NS vs. rest) and stenotic (-3%, p = NS vs. rest) vessel segments dilated when compared with the measurements after propranolol. Administration of nitroglycerin further increased luminal area of both vessel segments (normal segment, +23%, p less than 0.001; stenotic segment, +46%, p less than 0.001 vs. rest). It is concluded that dynamic exercise in patients with coronary artery disease is associated with coronary vasodilation of the normal and vasoconstriction of the stenotic coronary arteries. Patients with exercise-induced angina had significantly more stenosis vasoconstriction than patients without angina although minimal luminal area at rest was similar. Intravenous administration of propranolol is accompanied by a significant decrease in coronary luminal area of both normal and stenotic vessel segments at rest, which is overridden by dynamic exercise and sublingual nitroglycerin. The reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and the prevention of exercise-induced stenosis vasoconstriction might explain the beneficial effect of beta-blocker treatment in most patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that rotation of the left ventricular apex with respect to the base is a component of normal systolic function in humans, but it has been difficult to measure it noninvasively. Tagging is a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that labels specific areas of myocardium by selective radio-frequency excitation of narrow planes orthogonal to the imaging plane before acquiring an image. Tags appear as black lines and persist in myocardium for 400-500 msec and, if applied at end diastole, will move with the myocardium through systole. Tagging was used to noninvasively quantify left ventricular torsion and circumferential-longitudinal shear (shearCL) in humans. Eight normal volunteers, aged 24-38 years, were imaged in a 0.38-T iron-core resistive magnet. Five short-axis left ventricular images, positioned to encompass the entire left ventricle (LV), were obtained separately at end systole. Four equiangular radial tags had been applied at end diastole, intersecting the myocardium at eight locations. We calculated the difference in angular displacement of each epicardial and endocardial tag point (a tag point being where the tag crossed the epicardium or endocardium) at end systole from the systolic position of the corresponding tag point on the basal plane. This value was called the torsion angle. From this, shearCL, the angle inscribed on the epicardial or endocardial surface between the systolic tag position, the corresponding basal tag position, and its projection onto the slice of interest could be calculated at 32 points in the left ventricular wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A consistently effective transvenous defibrillation system for use in automatic defibrillators could significantly alter the approach to patients at risk of sudden death. Transvenous defibrillation systems that use a right ventricular (RV) electrode only or an RV electrode in combination with a chest patch are relatively inefficient at applying current to the posterolateral left ventricle. An RV electrode combined with a coronary sinus (CS) electrode, however, may improve current distribution to the posterolateral left ventricle. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a specially designed transvenous lead system with a CS electrode capable of current delivery to this relatively inaccessible region of the heart. In 20 survivors of cardiac arrest, we determined defibrillation efficacy immediately before defibrillator surgery for monophasic pulses delivered between an RV catheter electrode and a CS catheter electrode system and compared these findings with an RV catheter electrode-thoracic patch defibrillation system. Subsequently, we referenced the efficacy of both transvenous systems to an epicardial patch electrode system at the time of defibrillator implantation. The mean delivered-energy defibrillation threshold for the CS-RV electrode system was 17.5 +/- 7.9 J, which was substantially lower than the RV electrode-thoracic patch system (25.6 +/- 11.4 J, p = 0.0016 [46% more]). Defibrillation threshold voltage was 529 +/- 123 V for the CS-RV electrode system and 647 +/- 164 V (22% more) for the RV electrode-thoracic patch system (p = 0.0013).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to test the ability of newly developed biplane transesophageal color Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography in the detection of left main coronary artery stenosis. Blood flow in the left main coronary artery was detected in 57 of 67 (85%) patients by transesophageal color Doppler flow imaging. Using transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography, adequate images of the full length of the left main coronary artery and identification of the bifurcation were obtained in 60 of 67 (90%) patients. Transesophageal echocardiography clearly showed significant (greater than or equal to 50%) narrowing of the coronary lumen in 10 of 11 patients (sensitivity, 91%) and insignificant narrowing or no abnormalities of the coronary lumen in the other 49 patients (specificity, 100%). The positive predictive accuracy for left main coronary artery disease was 100%, and the negative predictive accuracy was 98%. This preliminary study suggests that biplane transesophageal color Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography appears to be a feasible noninvasive technique for imaging the left main coronary artery and detecting hemodynamically significant luminal obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether left ventricular (LV) end systole and end ejection uncouple in patients with long-term mitral regurgitation, 59 patients (22 control patients with atypical chest pain, 21 patients with aortic regurgitation, and 16 patients with mitral regurgitation) were studied with micromanometer LV catheters and radionuclide angiograms. End systole was defined as the time of occurrence (Tmax) of the maximum time-varying elastance (Emax), and end ejection was defined as the time of occurrence of minimum ventricular volume (minV) and zero systolic flow as approximated by the aortic dicrotic notch (Aodi). The temporal relation between end systole and end ejection in the control patients was Tmax (331 +/- 42 [SD] msec), minV (336 +/- 36 msec), and then, zero systolic flow (355 +/- 23 msec). This temporal relation was maintained in the patients with aortic regurgitation. In contrast, in the patients with mitral regurgitation, the temporal relation was Tmax (266 +/- 49 msec), zero systolic flow (310 +/- 37 msec, p less than 0.01 vs. Tmax), and then, minV (355 +/- 37 msec, p less than 0.001 vs. Tmax and p less than 0.01 vs. Aodi). Additionally, the average Tmax occurred earlier in the patients with mitral regurgitation than in the control patients and patients with aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.01, for both), whereas the average time to minimum ventricular volume was similar in all three patient groups. Moreover, the average time to zero systolic flow also occurred earlier in the patients with mitral regurgitation than in the control patients (p less than 0.01) and patients with aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.05). Because of the dissociation of end systole from minimum ventricular volume in the patients with mitral regurgitation, the end-ejection pressure-volume relations calculated at minimum ventricular volume did not correlate (r = -0.09), whereas those calculated at zero systolic flow did correlate (r = 0.88) with the Emax slope values. We conclude that end ejection, defined as minimum ventricular volume, dissociates from end systole in patients with mitral regurgitation because of the shortened time to LV end systole in association with preservation of the time to LV end ejection due to the low impedance to ejection presented by the left atrium. Therefore, pressure-volume relations calculated at minimum ventricular volume might not be useful for assessing LV chamber performance in some patients with mitral regurgitation.\r"

Five patients repaired after 2 years of age comprised a childhood surgery group, and six patients repaired before 2 years of age comprised an infant surgery group. All patients were exercised using either a treadmill or electronically braked bicycle with simultaneous thallium 201 scintigraphy. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, pulmonary functions, and electrocardiogram were all monitored continuously. Pulmonary reserve was normal in all patients. Based on heart rate reserve, respiratory exchange ratio, and oxygen-consumption response to work load, two patients in the infant surgery group stopped exercise before achieving maximum aerobic capacity. All remaining patients achieved their maximum aerobic capacity. There was no difference in work rate or oxygen consumption during exercise between the infant and childhood surgical group. Four patients (two in each surgical group) had an impaired chronotropic response to exercise. Three of these four patients demonstrated perfusion defects by thallium scintigraphy. Thallium scintigraphy was normal in all remaining patients. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were noted in seven of 11 patients having ventricular arrhythmias or ST segment depression. It is concluded from this study that exercise performance after repair of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is not affected by the age at which surgery is performed. Exercise is frequently associated with electrocardiographic evidence of abnormal myocardial perfusion despite frequently negative simultaneous 201Tl scintigraphy.\r"

Plasma lipoprotein mass concentrations were measured by analytic ultracentrifugation for flotation rates (F0(1.20), S0f) within high density lipoprotein (HDL) (F0(1.20) 0-9), low density lipoprotein (LDL) (S0f 0-12), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) (S0f 12-20), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (S0f 20-400) particle distributions. Particle diameter and flotation rate of the most abundant LDL species were determined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and analytic ultracentrifugation, respectively. During the 1-year trial, the exercisers ran (mean +/- SD) 15.6 +/- 9.1 km/wk, and the dieters ate 340 +/- 71 fewer kilocalories per day than at baseline. Total body weight was reduced significantly more in dieters (-7.2 +/- 4.1 kg) and exercisers (-4.0 +/- 3.9 kg) than controls (0.6 +/- 3.7 kg). As compared with mean changes in controls, the exercisers and dieters significantly increased HDL2 mass (48.6% and 47.1%, respectively), decreased VLDL mass (-23.9% and -25.5%), and increased LDL peak particle diameter (2.4 and 3.2 A). When adjusted to an equivalent change in body mass index by analysis of covariance, 1) exercise-induced and diet-induced weight loss produced comparable mean changes in the mass of small LDL and VLDL, and in LDL peak particle diameter; 2) the exercisers versus control group difference in HDL2 was attributed to the exercisers' reduced body mass index; and 3) HDL2 increased significantly less in dieters than in exercisers. In dieters, low calorie intake might mitigate the effects of weight loss on HDL2.\r"

We, therefore, performed physiological and pharmacological studies in white and black subjects with essential hypertension and their age-matched normotensive counterparts to assess autonomic and sympathetic nervous system function. One hundred one male subjects (47 white hypertensive, 17 black hypertensive, 22 white normotensive, and 15 black normotensive subjects) were evaluated for baroreceptor reflex sensitivity to low-pressure (amyl nitrite inhalation) and high-pressure (phenylephrine infusion) stimuli; cold pressor test heart rate and blood pressure responses; and blood pressure response to phentolamine alpha-adrenergic blockade. Hypertensive subjects exhibited an increase in resting heart rate, a decrease in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and an exaggerated decline in mean arterial pressure in response to phentolamine. These abnormalities were present to a comparable degree in black and white hypertensive subjects. Cold pressor testing revealed greater increases in heart rate in blacks as compared with whites; however, this racial difference was present regardless of blood pressure status, occurring in black normotensive and black hypertensive subjects to a comparable degree. Cold pressor test blood pressure increments were similar in the four groups. We conclude that both white hypertensive and black hypertensive subjects demonstrate similar abnormalities in autonomic and sympathetic nervous system function including blunting of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and an increased alpha-adrenergic receptor participation in blood pressure maintenance. The results do not suggest major racial differences in autonomic pathogenetic mechanisms in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To define the long-term variability of serial coronary flow reserve (CFR) measurements in humans and to evaluate the influence of changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and left ventricular preload on CFR, 45 patients with normal left ventricular function (38 cardiac allograft recipients, five patients with normal coronary arteries, and two patients with minimal coronary artery disease [less than 50% diameter stenosis]) were studied. CFR (ratio of peak hyperemic [h] to resting [r] coronary blood flow velocity [CBFV]) was measured with a 3F coronary Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine. Initial CFR measurements were highly correlated with repeat measurements obtained 11 +/- 0.6 months later (r = 0.95; mean absolute difference, 0.3 +/- 0.1; n = 17). Differences in CFR between studies were related to changes in heart rate (r = 0.61, p = 0.01) but not to changes in mean arterial pressure (r = 0.25, p = 0.33). To define the effects of rapid changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and preload on CFR, these variables were altered by atrial pacing, handgrip exercise, and volume expansion, respectively. Atrial pacing produced a rate-related increase in rCBFV but did not change hCBFV. Consequently, CFR was significantly reduced as heart rate was increased progressively from 76 +/- 2 in sinus rhythm (4.5 +/- 0.2) to 100 (3.8 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05, n = 32) to 120 beats/min (3.2 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05, n = 7). Despite a 19 +/- 2 mm Hg rise in mean arterial pressure during handgrip exercise, CFR was unchanged from baseline (3.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.4, p = NS, n = 7) because rCBFV rose proportionally with hCBFV. When pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was increased from 9 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 1 mm Hg after volume expansion, CFR was significantly decreased (from 3.8 +/- 0.2 to 2.9 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05, n = 9) because rCBFV was increased while hCBFV remained unchanged. Hence, serial CFR measurements in humans are highly reproducible in the absence of conditions known to affect resting or hyperemic coronary blood flow. Increases in heart rate or preload reduced CFR because rCBFV was increased while hCBFV was unchanged. In contrast, changes in mean arterial pressure did not alter CFR. Proper interpretation of CFR measurements should take into account the hemodynamic conditions at which they are obtained.\r"

  ".W": "The intrinsic limitations of coronary arteriography to predict the physiological effects of coronary obstructions are well known. Therefore, more direct assessments of the functional significance of coronary stenoses are becoming increasingly important. Study of contrast passage by electrocardiogram-triggered digital radiography has been proposed as a way of assessing changes in myocardial perfusion. The main problems in this approach are the limited time for motionless image acquisition, the potential alteration of vascular volume between different states, and the changing flow pattern induced by contrast agents. This has led to empiric substitution of mean transit time (Tmn) by other time parameters and to representation of vascular volume by maximal contrast intensity (Dmax). To avoid these problems, intact dogs were studied during almost motionless image acquisition of 20-25 consecutive paced heart beats obtained with synchronous radiographic pulses. In this way, unequivocal and reproducible determination of Tmn was possible. Constant and maximal vascular volume was created by continuous infusion of dipyridamole, and it was proved that coronary flow in this model was not influenced by contrast injections. Flow in the circumflex artery was measured by a ring mounted and calibrated Doppler probe. In each dog, flow in the circumflex artery was varied by a balloon occluder in 12 small steps (range, 0-174 +/- 42 ml/min). Inverse appearance time (1/Tapp), Dmax, Dmax/Tapp, inverse time of maximal intensity (1/Tmax), and 1/Tmn were calculated and the relations of these parameters to measured flow were investigated. Tmn proved to be the most reliable parameter for this purpose (r = 0.97 +/- 0.02; mean +/- SD), followed by Tmax (r = 0.93 +/- 0.04). Dmax failed to represent vascular volume but, in fact, showed a moderate correlation with flow (r = 0.78 +/- 0.22), as did Tapp (r = 0.64 +/- 0.18, 0.75 +/- 0.27, and 0.59 +/- 0.26 for the three definitions of Tapp used in this study). Dmax/Tapp correlated better with flow than either component separately. Our results indicate that the mean transit time calculated by videodensitometry can be used to accurately assess changes in myocardial perfusion strictly according to the original principles of indicator dilution theory.\r"

Four experimental conditions, as follows, were used: In group 1 (control), the hearts contracted isovolumetrically on a fluid-filled balloon in the left ventricle during both occlusion and reperfusion. In group 2, the balloon was present only during occlusion, and the heart was vented during reperfusion. Hearts in group 3 were vented during occlusion and developed pressure during reperfusion. In group 4, the left ventricle was vented during occlusion and reperfusion. Perfusion pressure (91.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) and coronary flow (0.88 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g) were not different between groups. Left ventricular pressures (mean of all groups) were 87.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg systolic and 6.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg diastolic. Infarcted myocardium was assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium staining and expressed as a percentage of the area at risk, as measured by fluorescent particles. Venting during both ischemia and reperfusion (n = 10) did result in significantly smaller infarcts than in the unvented controls (n = 10), that is, 13 +/- 5% vs. 41 +/- 6%, respectively. Venting only during reperfusion (n = 10) or occlusion (n = 11) did not significantly limit infarct size (57 +/- 6% and 32 +/- 5%, respectively), as compared with controls. Thus, the clinically feasible intervention of left ventricular venting during reperfusion was not cardioprotective.\r"

  ".W": "We compared left ventricular (LV) myocardial blood flow and function accompanying severe demand ischemia (rapid atrial pacing in the presence of critical bilateral coronary stenoses) and supply ischemia (complete bilateral coronary occlusion) of the same ischemic regions in 14 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Pacing-induced ischemia resulted in pronounced reductions in average regional epicardial blood flow (0.8 +/- 0.4 vs. control 1.2 +/- 0.4 [+/- SD] ml/g/min, p less than 0.05) and endocardial blood flow (0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. control 1.3 +/- 0.3 ml/g/min, p less than 0.05). More severe reductions in average regional epicardial and endocardial blood flow were seen after bilateral coronary occlusion (BCO) (0.3 +/- 0.3 and 0.1 +/- 0.1 vs. control 1.3 +/- 0.3 ml/g/min, p less than 0.05, respectively). Hemodynamics of postpacing ischemia (PPi) were consistently characterized by systolic impairment including depressed systolic contractile performance [(+)dP/dtmax 1,281 +/- 442 vs. control 2,173 +/- 775 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.05], ventricular dilation (left ventricular [LV] end-diastolic dimension [EDD] 47.6 +/- 7.8 vs. control 44.7 +/- 8.6 mm, p less than 0.05), and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) (14.4 +/- 2.8 vs. control 4.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Abnormalities in early and late diastolic function with PPi included increased time constant of isovolumic relaxation (78.0 +/- 40.4 vs. control 46.4 +/- 20.5 msec, p less than 0.05) and increased chamber stiffness (1.9 +/- 0.77 vs. control 0.81 +/- 0.55 mm Hg/mm, p less than 0.05), respectively. The LV diastolic pressure-dimension relation, however, shifted upward and to the right in eight of nine animals, whereas an upward shift was observed in only one animal. Thus, in this model of postpacing ischemia, we observed contractile failure and passive changes in diastolic function. Alterations in ventricular function occurred consistently earlier and to a greater extent during BCO than PPi, including higher LVEDP (25.3 +/- 8.1 vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), greater ventricular dilation (delta LVEDD 4.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 3.5 +/- 2.8 mm, p less than 0.05), and reduced minor-axis dimension shortening (3.3 +/- 3.1% vs. 6.5 +/- 3.6%, p less than 0.05). To detect potential qualitative differences in ventricular function between the two types of ischemia, we evaluated hemodynamics at comparable loading conditions (30 seconds to 1 minute of BCO).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The effects of caffeine and ryanodine on delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and sustained rhythmic activity in subendocardial Purkinje fibers surviving 1-day-old myocardial infarction in the dog were studied with standard microelectrode techniques. In preparations that showed sustained rhythmic activity, a high concentration of caffeine (10 mM) and ryanodine (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) slowed and terminated the sustained rhythmic activity and markedly suppressed DADs. An increase in the temperature of the tissue bath from 37 degrees to 39 degrees C did not change these results. In quiescent normal and infarcted preparations, a low concentration of caffeine (0.5 mM) differentially induced DADs in ischemic but not in normal Purkinje fibers, increased the amplitude of existing DADs, and brought subthreshold DADs to threshold potential that caused triggered activity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that triggered activity arising from DADs characterizes the sustained rhythmic activity in endocardial preparations 1 day after infarction and indicate an important role for the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the genesis of DADs and triggered activity in this model.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem, and nicardipine) on beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured cardiac myocytes isolated from neonatal rat ventricle were studied with the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177, which identifies cell surface-bound beta-receptors. The three calcium antagonists suppressed spontaneous beating of the myocytes, increased the number of beta-receptors, but did not alter the affinity (Kd). These effects were dose and time dependent. Verapamil (10(-6) M) increased the beta-receptor density by about 13% after 6 hours of incubation, and this increase in density reached a plateau of about 45% after 24 hours of incubation. beta-Receptor density increased by 15% with 5 x 10(-7) M and by 37% with 10(-6) M verapamil. The increased beta-receptors appeared to retain their normal function, as assessed by the increased spontaneous beating of the myocytes in response to applied isoproterenol. The increase in beta-receptors was abolished by colchicine but not by cycloheximide. When the calcium ion concentration of the medium was lowered to 0.1 mM, no significant change occurred in the density of beta-receptors compared with that in 1.8-mM Ca2+ medium. The results suggest that calcium antagonists increase beta-receptors by accelerating recycling by microtubules but not by decreasing the inward calcium current. Such effects of calcium antagonists may be clinically important and promise insight into the mechanism of the withdrawal phenomenon of calcium antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "To improve survival rates in patients undergoing surgical ablative procedures for malignant ventricular tachycardia (VT), a frequent practice is to implant epicardial patch electrodes at the time of map-guided surgery. After operation, patients with inducible VT often receive an automatic internal cardioverter/defibrillator (AICD) implant, whereas patients with noninducible VT usually do not. In the event that spontaneous, hypotensive VT or ventricular fibrillation should subsequently occur in the patient with noninducible VT, however, transthoracic defibrillation and resuscitation may prove difficult, because the patch electrodes are insulated with silicone rubber that can reduce the amount of current traversing the myocardium and thus can increase transthoracic defibrillation threshold (DFT). In this study, DFT was determined in mongrel dogs to test the hypothesis that epicardial patch electrodes elevate threshold. This study was also designed to assess the effect of patch electrode orientation and size on DFT. In the first protocol (perpendicular orientation), small epicardial patch electrodes (surface area, 30 cm2) were sutured to the epicardial surfaces of the anterior right and posterior left ventricles in 15 dogs so that the center axes of the patch electrodes were coincident and perpendicular to the coincident center axes of the transthoracic electrodes. The effect of two large epicardial patch electrodes (surface area, 53 cm2) on transthoracic DFT was also examined in eight of these dogs. In the second protocol (parallel orientation), small patch electrodes were sutured to the lateral surfaces of the right and left ventricles in seven dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group I (1976-1980) included patients who had Harrington rods, usually with Dwyer instrumentation. Group II (1980-1985) consisted of patients with unlinked Luque or wired-in Harrington rods. Group III (1985-1988) comprised patients with a unit Luque rod extending to the pelvis. Most patients were retarded nonwalkers who had total body involvement, pelvic obliquity, and severe thoracolumbar curves (Group I average, 97 degrees; Group II average, 72 degrees; Group III average, 89 degrees). The frontal plane correction at follow-up study averaged 51% in Group I, 47% in Group II, and 76% in Group III. The correction of the pelvic obliquity averaged 71% in Group I, 58% in Group II, and 86% in Group III. The general trend was toward longer fusion, use of the unit 0.625-cm Luque rod, and first-stage anterior discectomy and fusion without anterior instrumentation. The second-stage posterior arthrodesis and fusion is now performed only one week after the first-stage anterior procedure. Skeletal traction has been abandoned. The Luque rod instrumentation without fusion has also been abandoned.\r"

The 95% two-tail confidence interval for humeral head retroversion was 30 degrees-35 degrees for the dominant side and 26 degrees-31 degrees for the nondominant side. A larger retroversion angle was consistent with an increased range of external rotation. Mean external rotation in 90 degrees abduction was 105 degrees in the frontal plane and 120 degrees in the scapular plane. External rotation in 90 degrees abduction was greater in women than in men, but there was no difference between dominant and nondominant shoulder joints.

  ".W": "Failure of total elbow arthroplasty leads to difficult and complicated surgical reconstruction. This study evaluates the results of reconstruction after implant removal with respect to pain, motion, and functional ability. Between 1978 and 1985, 11 patients required implant removal. Indications for removal were infection for seven, implant fracture for three, and recurrent dislocation for one. The original diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis in six elbows and traumatic arthritis in five. The average length of the follow-up period was 5.5 years after implant removal (minimum, two years). Treatment consisted of implant removal and soft-tissue arthroplasty combined with external fixation in ten patients, and attempted arthrodesis with external fixation in one. There were four good, one fair, two poor, and four failed results. Satisfactory results were obtained in seven of the eight elbows in which an anatomic arthroplasty was achieved. This consisted of containment of the ulna by the humeral epicondylar remnants. All eight elbows were pain-free with an average arc of motion of 85 degrees (range, 55 degrees to 120 degrees). They had excellent elbow flexion power; however, triceps strength was often compromised. In the three elbows in which anatomic arthroplasty could not be achieved, one was flail, one was later converted to an arthrodesis with a customized plate, and the third required an immediate arthrodesis. All three were rated as failures. Fractures occurred in five of the 11 elbows. One occurred preoperatively, three occurred intraoperatively, and one occurred postoperatively. All healed satisfactorily during the course of immobilization. The importance of an anatomic arthroplasty when removing a total arthroplasty cannot be overemphasized. Retaining the epicondylar segments is important because satisfactory results were obtained in patients in whom entrapment of the olecranon within the epicondylar ridges was obtained. Such patients can achieve a satisfactory soft-tissue arthroplasty without the use of an interpositional material. When the epicondylar ridges were not retained and there was marked instability, the patients did not achieve satisfactory results.\r"

This two-incision approach may place the patient at risk for synostosis. If two incisions are to be used for distal biceps tendon reattachment, then a limited muscle-splitting approach through the extensor muscle mass, which avoids exposure of the ulna, may be preferable.\r"

MRI abnormalities were present in all 41 hips with osteonecrosis, even when symptoms were absent and roentgenographic findings were nonspecific or not yet apparent. A single possible false-positive MRI was noted in a hip with mild degenerative change. There was considerable variation in the pattern and extent of MRI abnormalities. The most common findings were irregularity of the subchondral cortical outline (82.9%), an inhomogeneous pattern of signal loss (50%), focal increases in signal intensity with T2 weighting (35.5%), and effusion (33.3%). Regions of dense cancellous bone on computed tomograms correlated with bands of low-intensity MRI signal. In the diagnosis of asymptomatic hips, MRI was clearly more sensitive than technetium bone imaging. The role of MRI in defining prognosis and treatment selection remains to be established.\r"

Contiguous, 5-mm coronal MRI sections were compared with corresponding histologic sections from six surgically excised femoral heads. After identifying specific areas of interest on the images, signal intensity was evaluated, both subjectively and objectively, and T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated. Mean values for these data were compared among the following histologic categories: normal bone, unrepaired dead bone and marrow, unrepaired dead bone with marrow replaced by amorphous debris, and zones of repair. For each type of tissue, MRI signal intensity on T1- and intermediately T2-weighted images behaved in a distinctive fashion. Active repair tissue could be differentiated from both necrotic bone and normal bone by a tendency for the signal to increase in intensity on intermediately T2-weighted images. These findings suggest that MRI may provide a noninvasive means of quantitatively analyzing the volume and spacial distribution of repair tissue in osteonecrotic femoral heads. In clinical practice, such analysis may lead to improvements in disease staging and treatment planning.\r"

The technique is described using multiple 9-mm perforations placed at least 5 cm apart on the anterior surface of the femoral shaft. The tip of the revision stem should be at least 5 cm distal to the most distal perforation. From January 1984 to December 1986, 219 cases of revision total hip arthroplasties were performed using this technique; the incidence of ipsilateral postoperative femoral fractures was nine out of 219. Eight of these fractures were at the tip or distal to the femoral prosthesis and were associated with trauma. One fracture occurred through a perforation site and had an associated fracture of the femoral component. This method appears to be a reliable and safe method of cement removal from the femoral canal.\r"

Five of these patterns expand the taxonomic concepts of Ahlback; the sixth, \"nonproliferative,\" was previously undescribed. It was seen exclusively in patients with varus disease and was characterized by a lack of reactive bony changes. Knees with degenerative changes in the medial compartment constituted the majority of cases (63%). The average age of patients was 72 years for those with varus disease, 79 years for those with valgus disease, and 84 years for those with patellofemoral arthritis (PFA). Bilateral involvement was common only in patients with PFA (79%), suggesting a developmental cause for this subset. There was a female predominance in valgus and patellofemoral disease. The authors report here on a classification system of IOA that has been designed and modified to reflect the unique roentgenographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characterization of the six subsets.\r"

Results are expressed in terms of maximum load to failure, elongation at the site of fixation, stiffness of fixation prior to failure, and mode of failure. When failure of the test model occurred, it was always at the ligament--fixation device interface, the fixation device--bone interface, or a combination of the two. Elongation was recorded in all modes of fixation. The most secure fixation was obtained with a cortical screw and a looped ligament, the strength and predictability being mainly dependent on bone quality. The least secure and least predictable fixation was obtained with a prototype called bucket wedge. A barbed ligament staple and an unlooped ligament also had low predictability and considerably less strength than the screw fixation but showed less sensitivity to alterations in bone quality.\r"

Twenty reoperations, excluding pin removal, were performed in eight patients (62%). A satisfactory result was achieved in only 50% overall and in only 38% of patients with roentgenographic changes of neuropathic arthropathy.

When a soft-tissue sarcoma is suspected, comprehensive preoperative staging studies are an important part of the diagnostic and therapeutic management. With the use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance image scanning, the role of the arteriogram in the staging of soft-tissue tumors has been markedly diminished. There is still, however, a place for the arteriogram in the staging of soft-tissue tumors that are proximate to or displace the neurovascular bundle. Two patients demonstrated LS that arose from the popliteal artery, illustrating the importance of arteriography. When indentation and displacement can be visualized, involvement of the artery should be suspected. This may be critical when considering limb salvage versus amputation surgery. If limb salvage surgery is to be accomplished, an interpositional graft and segmental resection of the artery are necessary.\r"

The use of six pins increased torsional rigidity, but this configuration failed at lower bending loads when compared to the four-pin configuration, reflecting the uneven holding strength of the pin clamp on three pins. The ball joint maximum torsional resistance was reduced by 27.2%, and the maximum bending resistance was decreased by 35.2% after first failure loading of a fatigue test. The strength of the ball joint returned to the normal level after replacement of the cam and bushing with new components. The locking strength of the fixator body telescoping mechanism was high and did not change during repetitive failure loading. Hence, the fixator should be applied under the four-pin configuration, placing pins in the outer slots of the clamps as recommended by the manufacturer. The frame stability is governed by the performance of the ball joint, and its locking cam should be tightened periodically. If the ball joint locking position starts to migrate from its initial position, the cam and bushing should be replaced.\r"

The external fixator was removed at an average of 12 weeks (range, three to 25 weeks) for malreductions in six case, atrophic segmental fractures in two, and atrophic/unstable fracture patterns in five. Intramedullary nailing was performed at an average of 13 days (range, five to 30 days) after fixator removal. There were 12 reamed nails and one self-broaching nail. Preoperative antibiotics averaged eight days, and postoperative averaged 11 days. All patients healed with bridging callus; full weight bearing occurred at an average of 2.7 months. Follow-up evaluation averaged 22.5 months. Weight bearing began within the first three weeks in 12 of 13 patients. Results were rated as excellent in eight and good in five. There were no complications related to infection or non-union. Delayed intramedullary nailing, after excluding potential high-risk patients, is an option for the treatment of tibia fractures that have failed treatment with external fixation. However, it is not recommended as a routine procedure.\r"

Thus, the study group consisted of a total of 37 tibial fractures: 20 treated by Ender rods and 17 treated by external fixation. Open tibial fractures treated with Ender rods had a significantly lower number of complications than those treated with external fixation. The group treated with Ender rods also had a significantly lower number of surgical procedures per patient in Grades I and II open tibial fractures. There were no statistical differences regarding weeks to union or hospital days. Ender rods are superior to external fixation removed early in the treatment of Gustilo's Grades I, II, and IIIA open fractures with either stable or unstable fracture configuration (Orthopaedic Trauma Association Grades IA-IC, IIA-IID, and IIIA-IIIC). Perhaps future study will allow sufficient numbers to determine whether Ender rods can be used in Grades IIIB and IIIC open tibial fractures, but there are no data at this time to support this conclusion.\r"

The method was tested in 6-mm tibial segmental defects and single-cut osteotomy defects in adult mongrel dogs. The lowest measureable bone density in the defect was compared to bending rigidity of the involved extremity. For both types of defect, an exponential relationship was found between the densitometric evaluation of the healing fracture gap and bending rigidity. This method proved superior to a roentgenographic scoring method and is capable of detecting small differences in mineral content using standard roentgenograms. The high correlation between densitometric evaluation and bone rigidity indicates this method has potential for use in the in vivo assessment of fracture healing.\r"

Addition of culture media conditioned by membranes from six patients and bone-cement membranes from two patients to the mouse calvarial cultures resulted in a significantly increased release of calcium. The effect of capsule-conditioned media on calcium release was dose- and time-dependent and significantly reduced by the osteoclast inhibitor of calcitonin. Histologic analysis of bones at the end of the culture period showed that capsule-conditioned media enhanced the breakdown of mineralized bone and increased the number of osteoclasts. The observations showed that newly formed periprosthetic tissues from patients with loose total hip arthroplasties (THAs) can produce one or several factors that stimulate bone resorption in vitro by an osteoclast-mediated mechanism. Not only mechanical failure but also biologic reactions in the periprosthetic tissues eventually lead to osteoclast activation and may contribute to the loosening of THAs.\r"

Postoperative function was correlated with preoperative function. Strength had increased more than 200% by 14 months postoperatively, with no instance of excessive lengthening of the triceps. In 13 cases, the dorsiflexors had been without function preoperatively. Two of those cases again lost the dorsiflexor function achieved postoperatively, when dynamic shortening recurred after one year. The study thus confirms the view that antagonist function improves when spasticity in the agonist is reduced by tendon lengthening.\r"

If mechanisms of chemonucleolysis include diminution of intradiscal pressure followed by subsequent regeneration of the nucleus pulposus, then a more selective enzyme for glycosaminoglycan, chondroitinase ABC, might be used for chemonucleolysis instead of chymopapain. Thus experimental chemonucleolysis with chondroitinase ABC compared with chymopapain was investigated. In rabbits, chondroitinase ABC is as effective for chemonucleolysis as chymopapain, but the chemonucleolysis process with chondroitinase ABC was milder than with chymopapain. At an early chemonucleolysis phase, chondroitinase ABC action was chiefly limited to digestion of the matrix, and a large number of cells in the nucleus pulposus remained. During long-term observations of chemonucleolysis with chondroitinase ABC, nuclear structure was restored to a nearly normal state. Although limited, this study indicates that chondroitinase ABC might be more suitable than chymopapain for chemonucleolysis.\r"

Seven months after operation, the strength had been regained; by 13 months after operation, it had increased by a median value of 22%. In 20 cases, strength had increased by more than 50%. The present study confirms the theory that quadriceps function is strengthened when the antagonist function is weakened. The study also explains (1) why it often takes six months for gait to become better than before operation and (2) why spasticity of the rectus often increases after the hamstrings are lengthened.\r"

The principles of the present authors' treatment for children with the disease are physical therapy (involving neurodevelopmental treatment) and surgical treatment for contractures and deformities. The authors studied the long-term results of physical therapy and its effect on the necessity for surgery and the improvement of locomotor function. From 1973 to 1988, 355 children with spastic diplegia were treated at the authors' facility. From this group, the authors selected and studied 71 children who received systematic treatment for a minimum of one year and who could be followed at the age of six years or older. At the follow-up examination, 41 of these children were free ambulators, 28 were crutch ambulators, and two were not ambulatory. Of the 41 freely ambulatory children, four achieved free ambulation after the age of seven years. Of the 28 crutch ambulators, relatively small hip-flexion contractures were found in 11 children who had received the early developmental treatment program.\r"

  ".W": "The prerequisites for normal gait are: (1) stability in the stance phase of gait, (2) clearance of the foot in the swing phase, (3) proper foot preposition in swing, and (4) an adequate step length. In the stance phase, the knee provides shock absorption and energy conservation; in the swing phase, it allows foot clearance. To accomplish these functions, the knee must extend fully in stance and flex approximately 60 degrees in swing. Consequently, balanced muscle action at the hip, knee, and ankle joints, combined with adequate acceleration from the hip flexor and triceps surae muscles, is essential. In the crouch gait of spastic cerebral palsy, hamstring lengthening alone often converts the flexed-knee gait to an extended-knee, stiff-legged gait with inadequate swing-phase knee flexion. This unwanted conversion is due to cospasticity of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Restoration of normal knee function in patients with spastic paralysis is more successful when fractional hamstring lengthening is combined with a transfer of the distal rectus femoris tendon to either the iliotibial band or the distal tendon of the semitendinosus.\r"

  ".W": "A system of surgical treatment of deformities of the ankle and foot in cerebral palsy is presented on the basis of experience with 420 children. The aim of surgery is prevention or correction of deformities. There are three types of deformity (fixed, dynamic, and mixed), each of which is treated differently. Surgery should be delayed as long as there is functional improvement. The most common indication for foot surgery is equinus deformity, which makes it difficult to keep the heel in the shoe. Tendo Achillis lengthening is satisfactory for fixed equinus, and transfer of the medial belly and the tendon of the gastrocnemius to the dorsum of the foot is appropriate for dynamic equinus. Hindfoot valgus in hypertonic cerebral palsy is treated by peroneus brevis elongation when moderate and in combination with subtalar arthrodesis when severe. Hindfoot valgus in hypotonic cerebral palsy is treated by subtalar arthrodesis only. Hindfoot varus is treated by tibialis posterior lengthening, usually in combination with (1) tendo Achillis lengthening, (2) a Steindler plantar release, or (3) valgus calcaneal osteotomy. Dynamic forefoot supination is treated by split-tibialis anterior tendon transfer or, when associated with dorsiflexion of the hallux, by extensor hallucis longus transfer.\r"

  ".W": "A hypermobile hyperextension or hyperflexion deformity of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint associated with thumb-in-palm deformity in 90 patients affected by cerebral palsy was treated by arthrodesis with or without soft-tissue procedures. Twenty-two of these patients were adults with closed physes, and 68 were children or adolescents with open growth plates. The MCP joint fusion was usually accompanied by intrinsic muscle lengthening and/or extrinsic tendon transfer, but occasionally it was the only procedure performed to diminish the thumb-in-palm position. Even in four-year-olds, joint fusion was a predictable procedure to establish stability of that joint without disturbing longitudinal or circumferential growth. Measurable function was improved to a mild or moderate degree in 44 of the 50 children who were followed to maturity. Eighteen of the 68 children were unavailable for follow-up evaluation. Six of the 50 followed patients showed no functional improvement, although arthrodesis of the MCP joint occurred in four of the six. The other two patients were operated on when they were 12 years of age and developed a fibrous union that was painless and stable when they were adults. Even those patients who had no functional improvement did have improved appearance and easier control of the affected hand when it was manipulated by the opposite hand. The children were followed to maturity with age-matched cerebral palsy control patients. There was no significant disturbance in growth of those thumbs that had MCP joint fusion when the physes were open.\r"

The current report presents data on physiologic trends in preterm infant heart rate and oxygenation as related to the timing and content of caregiver stimulation, specifically medical and social forms of touch. Results indicate that while most instances of bradycardia were not closely preceded by tactile stimulation, prebradycardia periods, which included touch, had lower pO2 levels than did baseline periods that included touch. These findings suggest that medical or \"developmental\" tactile stimulation presented when the infant was already physiologically compromised (with low pO2) may potentiate an underlying vulnerability to bradycardia. Timing, versus type, may be the better predictor of the physiologic effect of caregiver interventions on preterm infants.\r"

The development of the intervention group was compared with that of a similar group of low-birthweight infants who did not receive the intervention and contrasted with that of a group of normal-birthweight infants. The intervention had a significant effect on maternal adjustment and perception of the infant at 6 months. No significant effect on infant cognitive development was apparent until 36 months (that is, 31 months after the intervention had ceased). The intervention effect was even more significant at 48 months. It appeared that the two low-birthweight groups had progressively diverged after 12 months, the intervention group rising until it approximated the normal-birthweight group in cognitive development, whereas the low-birthweight control group deteriorated. The economical nature of the MITP, its unique (although delayed) benefits, and the apparent durability of the intervention effect, suggest that this intervention program has important theoretical and practical implications and potentially far-reaching applications.\r"

The plasticity of the human brain during postnatal development has been contrasted for a sensory, i.e., auditory, and cognitive system by comparing the development of two different evoked potential components. The short-latency auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which are generated by auditory neurons within the brainstem auditory pathway, are mature by 1 to 2 years after birth. The rate of ABR development, as shown by longitudinal recordings from preterm infants, appears to be equally rapid in intrauterine and extrauterine environments. In contrast, the long-latency P300 cognitive potential, which reflects such processes as sequential information processing and short-term memory, does not show a mature waveform and latency until 14 to 17 years of age. This protracted rate of development cannot yet be related to a brain substrate, as the generator origins of the P300 are unknown. Clinical and animal data suggest, however, that limbic structures are critically involved. The long developmental history of the P300, in contrast to the ABRs, provides a functional measure of developmental plasticity in a cognitive versus a sensory brain system.\r"

At this time, the greatest hope for effective remedial interventions comes from the choline and metyrapone studies. However, I am also reminded of the components a psychiatrist who worked with children in the heart of Philadelphia made some 20 years ago at a conference on mental retardation. He said that the most significant contribution to the elimination of mental retardation in his city would be the elimination of lead-based paints from the walls of ghetto apartments, an intervention second only in effectiveness to the elimination of the ghettos themselves. The importance of early interventions with individuals suffering brain damage, either general or specific, is clearly recognized. In research now well underway, Yong Shen, William Smotherman, and I have found encouraging results indicating that both short- and long-term effects of hypoxia induced by clamping the rat's umbilical cord can be attenuated by the prior administration of a calcium L channel antagonist. If those results are upheld in further studies, the principles of prevention of damage described in this article for the adult may prove to be even more potent in the young.\r"

  ".W": "The results of our studies of corticocortical connectivity in developing monkey association cortex contrast with those obtained in similar studies of sensory regions in other species. In association areas of the monkey, these connections emerge very early in development, and many of the details of their organization are well specified from their earliest appearance. The presence of an adultlike pattern of organization a full month before birth suggests that these events probably are determined in large part by forces independent of general environmental stimulation, unlike the pattern seen for sensory regions in the cat. Do these differences reflect variations between species or between the development of sensory and nonsensory regions of the cortex? The answer is probably both. Our results suggest that diverse areas of the brain may differ in the extent to which they respond to environmental influences. For example, many of the organizational features that apparently emerge from an initially diffuse organization in sensory areas appear to be more strictly specified in their initial formation in the prefrontal cortex. However, we should not rule out the possibility that many of the features of connectional organization that are responsive to the environment in the sensory areas (e.g., the distribution of corticocortical neurons) develop in the prefrontal cortex during the prenatal period and therefore may simply be buffered from the effects of environmental stimuli. In addition, many aspects of the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex clearly continue to develop well into the postnatal period and may be subject to modification by experience. Among these are the organization and density of synaptic contacts and the elaboration of dendritic surfaces. Although relatively little is known concerning the response of these features to stimulation in the prefrontal cortex, studies from sensory areas suggest that these may be good candidates for modification by external interventions. The text of this paper was taken from a presentation given at the 1986 Johnson and Johnson Pediatric Roundtable. In the period between the original talk and the publication of this article, several studies have emerged on the development of corticocortical connectivity in sensory cortical regions of nonhuman primates. In agreement with our data in the monkey prefrontal cortex, these studies have also found that the distribution of callosal neurons in the somatosensory and visual cortices is adultlike at least 1 month prior to birth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. The hypothesis was tested that the renal xanthine oxidase system provides a source of oxygen free radicals in puromycin aminonucleoside and adriamycin experimental nephrosis by generating uric acid from hypoxanthine and xanthine. 2. The concentrations in renal tissue of the putative intermediary products of puromycin aminonucleoside metabolism, hypoxanthine and xanthine, and of their precursors, adenosine and inosine, were lower in rats treated with puromycin aminonucleoside than in normal controls, whereas concentrations of the metabolites were normal after adriamycin intoxication. Their daily urinary excretion was lower in the 24 h after puromycin aminonucleoside administration compared with the baseline values and returned to near normal levels within 5 days. After adriamycin the 24 h urinary excretion of xanthine and uric acid was double the baseline levels (P less than 0.001). 3. When equimolar amounts of hypoxanthine were injected instead of puromycin aminonucleoside, the concentration of all bases increased slightly in renal tissue and their urinary efflux was double the baseline level: allantoin, uric acid, the unmodified nucleotide and xanthine were the most represented compounds in urine. 4. The enzymatic activities relative to xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22) and xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204) in renal tissues were unchanged 1 day after puromycin aminonucleoside or hypoxanthine intoxication and only moderately increased in both groups at 13 days (the time of appearance of heavy proteinuria in the puromycin aminonucleoside-treated group). In contrast, xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities were higher in adriamycin-treated rats at 1 and 15 days after the treatment (P less than 0.001). 5. Feeding rats with normoprotein diets containing tungsten induced a marked and constant decrease of renal xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities to 20% of the baseline values in both puromycin aminonucleoside- and adriamycin-treated rats. Inhibition of renal xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities by tungsten was associated with a marked reduction (P less than 0.001) of proteinuria in adriamycin-treated rats and the same occurred with allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase activity. In contrast, tungsten treatment did not reduce the proteinuria associated with puromycin aminonucleoside, which reached a maximum 13 days after puromycin aminonucleoside intoxication. Hypoxanthine-treated rats were normoproteinuric after 2 months of observation. 6. These data demonstrate an activation of renal xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase after adriamycin intoxication which is relevant to the induction of proteinuria. They also argue against the involvement of the renal xanthine oxidase system as a source of free radicals in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis and suggest that the nucleotide cycle is not a normal route for puromycin aminonucleoside degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Decreases in Ca2+ inward transport and Na(+)-K+ co-transport activity, and increases in erythrocyte Ca2+ and K+ contents, were observed. 3. The more pronounced changes found in advanced carcinoma stages proved to be related to a 50% incidence of a mild anaemia of chronic disease in patients with carcinoma stages T3 and T4. 4. 'Young' (light) erythrocytes from healthy donors obtained by density centrifugation showed modifications in Na+ transport and K+ content similar to those seen in the patients. 5. It is concluded that the decrease in Na(+)-K+ co-transport activity, as well as the elevated K+ content and the lowered mean corpuscular haemoglobin content, but not the disturbances in Ca2+ homoeostasis, in erythrocytes of patients with carcinomas of the head and neck are most probably due to the occurrence of a mild anaemia of chronic disease in advanced carcinoma stages, associated with a reduction in mean erythrocyte age.\r"

Since prostaglandin E2 could play a role in idiopathic hypercalciuria, and considering the well-established hypocalciuric action of hydrochlorothiazide, we have evaluated the effect of 15 days' treatment with hydrochlorothiazide in 10 hypercalciuric male stoneformers on urinary Ca2+ and prostaglandin E2, as well as on plasma bicyclo-prostaglandin E2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone. 2. In addition to lowering urinary Ca2+ (P less than 0.001), hydrochlorothiazide also promoted a significant fall in urinary prostaglandin E2 (P less than 0.001), plasma bicyclo-prostaglandin E2 (P less than 0.001) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P less than 0.01), and an increase in plasma parathyroid hormone (P less than 0.025), whereas plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was unchanged. 3. A positive correlation between urinary Ca2+ and prostaglandin E2 was present before (P less than 0.00005), but not after, hydrochlorothiazide. Plasma bicyclo-prostaglandin E2 and plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were positively correlated both before (P less than 0.005) and after (P less than 0.005) hydrochlorothiazide, as was also the percentage change in each induced by the drug (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, the changes in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D after hydrochlorothiazide were negatively correlated (P less than 0.05). 4. It is suggested that a block of prostaglandin E2 synthesis plays a role in the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on Ca2+ metabolism, most probably through an inhibition of 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity.\r"

  ".W": "1. Low intracellular concentrations of myo-inositol in diabetic cells may contribute to the development of tissue damage. The cause of these low levels is unknown, but inhibition of a putative myo-inositol transporter by high concentrations of glucose has been proposed. We have developed a triple-isotope method for estimating myo-inositol influx into human leucocytes and so investigated both the kinetics of this uptake in normal volunteers and the effect of glucose upon it. 2. Uptake was composed of a passive component with a rate constant of 2.4 +/- 0.3 X 10(-2) min-1 and a saturable component with a Km of 61 +/- 23 mumol/l and Vmax of 11.3 +/- 4.5 X 10(-4) mmol min-1 l-1. Ouabain and low extracellular concentrations of sodium partly inhibited influx. Uptake was predominantly into the cytosolic fraction of the cell with 12% entering the membrane-associated fraction at both 5 and 10 min. 3. myo-Inositol influx was significantly inhibited by both D- and L-glucose but not by sucrose. Neither cytochalasin B nor ethyl isopropyl amiloride significantly inhibited uptake. 4. It is concluded that a myo-inositol transporter exists in human leucocytes which is similar to that found in other species and tissues. Our technique allows myo-inositol influx in diabetic subjects to be related to varying glycaemic control and tissue damage.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term treatment of asthma has for years included supplemental oxygen, IV theophylline, and subcutaneously administered and inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids. This regimen has not really changed. What have changed, however, are the specificity of the drugs and the mode of their administration. Metered-dose inhalers can deliver selective beta-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids directly to the airway mucosa. Topical delivery of medication has dramatically reduced the side effects of all classes of medication. As experience accrues, more studies indicate that inhalation therapy may become the mainstay of asthma treatment, even in the emergency department. Metered-dose inhalers have also aided in the resurgence of the use of cromolyn. There is certainly improved ease of administration and perhaps a reduced incidence of rebound bronchospasm. The appearance of newer beta 2-adrenergic agonists with improved beta 2-adrenergic selectivity and longer half-lives underscores the activity in asthma research. There is hope that selective bronchodilating corticosteroids or calcium-channel blockers can be developed. Bronchodilating prostaglandins and leukotrienes, or inhibitors of prostaglandins and leukotrienes that cause bronchoconstriction, are being investigated. An oral mast-cell membrane stabilizer is available and hopefully can be improved. Finally, the transdermal delivery of medication may open an entirely new avenue for the treatment of those suffering from asthma.\r"

It may also be useful for the allergic pregnant patient to reduce the severity of asthma or rhinitis, and possibly to prevent the complications of severe asthma. It may reduce the use of other medications that are undesirable during pregnancy. Allergen immunotherapy has been shown to be safe for both the mother and fetus during pregnancy. It does not need to be stopped during pregnancy, but the maintenance dose should be modified. Immunotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of severe allergic disease by virtue of its capacity to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and late-phase airway responses that lead to inflammation and chronic symptoms.\r"

In contrast, the bilateral or unilateral absence of cortical potential was associated with severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or death in a high percentage of patients. A reliable prediction of outcomes was obtained from SEP recorded within 24 h of head injury. Predictive accuracy was not influenced by the time of recording or cumulative analysis of consecutive daily SEP over the first 4 days after injury. Short-latency SEP can provide a reliable and accurate prognosis for sedated and curarized patients, and can have an important role in the management and triage of patients with severe head injury who are undergoing intensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The use of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference P(A-a)O2 and the oxygenation index (mean airway pressure [Paw] FIO2 x 100/PaO2) have been proposed for selecting infants who will require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. However, the use of the oxygenation index (OI) in conjunction with Paw in an exclusive population of patients with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) has not been reported. Fourteen patients born in our facility and managed with conventional therapy and five infants treated with ECMO were enrolled in the study. All patients had clinical and x-ray evidence of MAS. Infants who received conventional treatment required mechanical ventilation greater than 48 h, FIO2 1.0, and were under the care and supervision of one neonatologist. Management was directed to minimize barotrauma by avoidance of routine hyperventilation, use of lower Paw, and sufficient expiratory time. One patient died before ECMO and 13 infants survived. Six survivors had an OI greater than 25 (three had an OI greater than 40), six had a Paw greater than or equal to 12 cm H2O (12 to 15 cm H2O in five infants) and six patients had a P(A-a)O2 greater than or equal to 610 torr. One surviving infant was transferred for ECMO therapy (OI 67, Paw 20 cm H2O). The five patients treated with ECMO survived (OI 48 to 92, Paw 20 to 29.5 cm H2O P(A-a)O2 627 to 650 torr). One patient in each group developed chronic lung disease with evidence of resting tachypnea. Our findings indicate that an OI greater than 40 in association with a Paw greater than or equal to 20 cm H2O may be helpful in predicting which infants with MAS need ECMO, whereas patients requiring a Paw less than or equal to 15 cm H2O can be managed with conventional therapy. An OI greater than or equal to 25 but less than 40 is not associated with high mortality in these patients. The predictive value of Paw of 16 to 20 cm H2O and the duration of an OI greater than 40 in patients with MAS need further investigation.\r"

Of 310 patients, 40 patients (nosocomially infected patient ratio 12.9) developed 78 infections (nosocomial infection ratio 25.2), of which 28% (n = 22) were wounds, within 2 months of surgery. Early wound infection followed 8% of closed, nonpump cases and 6.7% of open, pump cases. Wound infection was more likely if the sternum was open on the ward (elective or emergency) (27.6% open vs. 5.0% closed, p less than .001) or if the PRISM score was greater than or equal to 10 on PICU admission (10.7% greater than or equal to 10 vs. 2.3% less than 10, p less than .01). The causative agents in wound infections in closed cases were Staphylococcus aureus (70%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) (30%) while in open, pump cases the agents were CONS (33%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%), Candida spp. (27%), and S. aureus (20%). Nonwound infections accounted for 72% of infections (n = 56). The number of bacteremias and other central and arterial line-related infections approximated wound infection in incidence at 6.8/100 patients. Wound infections are more likely if the sternum has been left open on the ward, if the patient has a high PRISM score on PICU admission, and after specific surgical procedures.\r"

Analyses included mean and SD of the difference between the two measurements, the correlation coefficient (r value), and the concordance correlation coefficient. The pH meter values disagreed significantly with pH paper measurements. Measurements of gastric secretion pH with pH indicator paper do not guide therapy reliably. Inaccurate values derived from pH paper measurements could have resulted in inappropriate treatment in 28% of the samples tested. A portable, battery-powered pH meter accurately reproduced laboratory pH meter measurements and is a reasonable device for clinical use.\r"

One hundred mg/kg bovine surfactant sonicated in saline or 3 ml/kg saline placebo was instilled via the trachea at about 10 min of age. The clinical status and physiologic changes were monitored for 9 days, and pulmonary histopathology was evaluated after death. Compared to the control, the surfactant-treated animals showed a significant improvement in arterial/alveolar oxygen ratio and pulmonary compliance, facilitating rapid weaning from assisted ventilation. Lung histology revealed that pulmonary parenchyma expanded 70% to 95% without features of early BPD. Dysplastic maturation, air trapping, or cellular atypia was not seen. In contrast, lung histology in the control group revealed alveolar expansion less than or equal to 50%, basal cell hyperplasia in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, dysplastic maturation with cellular atypia, extensive epithelial erosion, and type II cell hyperplasia, all features of early BPD. The results of this study suggest that in the premature baboon model, exogenous surfactant therapy improves pulmonary functional abnormalities and lessens the histologic features of BPD, perhaps because of rapid weaning and reduced barotrauma.\r"

However, this method has not been compared to more conventional techniques such as echocardiography. This study compared simultaneously obtained thermodilution cardiac output and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), and echocardiographic left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), to bioimpedance cardiac output and the maximum first derivative of the bioimpedance signal (dZ/dtmax) during positive inotropic stimulation and preload reduction. Eight pigs were instrumented with a rapid response thermistor (positioned in the pulmonary artery) and bioimpedance electrodes. Simultaneous thermodilution, echocardiographic, and bioimpedance measurements were performed at baseline and after 5, 10, and 15 min of isoproterenol infusion (0.5 microgram/kg.min). In six pigs, measurements were also performed after balloon occlusion of the inferior vena cava. A significant correlation was observed between LVFS and dZ/dtmax (r = .88, n = 35) over all time points. Thermodilution and bioimpedance cardiac output were in close agreement (r = .92, n = 35). However, bioimpedance overestimated cardiac output in the very low and high output states. The mean difference between thermodilution and bioimpedance cardiac outputs was -0.02 +/- 0.37 L/min. There was a positive relationship between RVEF and dZ/dtmax (r = .54, n = 35). In summary, bioimpedance was significantly correlated with thermodilution cardiac output over a wide hemodynamic range. The peak first derivative of the bioimpedance signal dZ/dtmax may provide a noninvasive index of ventricular pump performance. Further studies are required to evaluate the diagnostic value of bioimpedance cardiography in the clinical setting.\r"

Sepsis was produced by cecal ligation and punctures. Forty rats were subjected to behavioral study and divided into two groups (control, n = 15; sepsis, n = 25). Septic rats died within 36 h, and the rats developed behavioral depression, and showed EEG slowing and an increase in pain threshold. The latter was evaluated by a tail flick method within 8 h after the surgical procedures, while control rats did not show significant change in either behaviors or pain threshold. In another study, LCGU was measured when behavioral depression, increase in pain threshold, and EEG slowing developed in the sepsis group (n = 7). In this group, the mean LCGU in auditory and parietal cortices, lateral geniculate, superior colliculus, hippocampus, and locus ceruleus was 95, 74, 67, 69, 72, and 53 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, being lower by 23%, 22%, 18%, 19%, 14%, and 27% than that in the sham-operated control group (n = 7), respectively. However, the mean LCGU in septal and raphe nuclei was 52 and 84 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, being significantly higher by 27% and 33% than that in the control group, respectively. These results suggest that septic encephalopathy is associated with metabolic changes in the discrete brain regions, which are related to the serotonergic or noradrenergic system.\r"

The correlation between CORA and COSP was significant (r = .94, p less than .0001) and could be described by the formula CORA = 0.33 + 0.96 COSP.

In 175 consecutive ICU patients, plasma Se measured during the first week of ICU admission was 0.66 +/- 0.21 mumol/L (mean +/- SD) and was less than that measured in 57 healthy blood donors (1.05 +/- 0.21 mumol/L, p less than .001). Sixty-eight percent of plasma Se concentrations fell below the lower limit of the reference range. Plasma Se decreased with the number of weeks in the ICU (r = .33, p less than .01) with values decreasing to 0.49 +/- 0.20 mumol/L during the fourth week. Urinary Se excretion measured in a subgroup of 20 patients was related to plasma Se concentration (r = .38, p less than .05), and inversely related to N balance (r = .50, p less than .01). We conclude that decreased plasma Se concentrations are common in ICU patients and that catabolic states are associated with increased Se losses. These losses are unlikely to account for the marked reductions in plasma Se concentrations, and the findings suggest there may be significant changes in the distribution of body Se during critical illness.\r"

Nitrite-rich salty foods (e.g., cured meats) were directly related to metaplasia at both examinations. Vitamin C intake did not appear to have prevented the development of intestinal metaplasia. Smoking was directly related to the presence of metaplasia, but the association was weaker than was observed for cured meats. The strong association between nitrite-rich salty foods and metaplasia appears to be uniform from one study to another, as is the lack of a consistent relation between metaplasia and either smoking or vitamin C consumption. Heavy smokers were more likely to have metaplasia than were nonsmokers, but these associations were weaker than were those with cured meats.\r"

In this study, a dose-related and reversible inhibitory effect of neurotensin was demonstrated in pentobarbital-anesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats underwent continuous gastric perfusion with saline, 1 ml/min, and intravenous infusion of both pentagastrin and neurotensin. Inhibition of acid secretion did not depend upon the occurrence of hypotension, and ranged from 35 +/- 7% of maximal acid output at 0.24 nmol/kg/hr to 60 +/- 10% at 7.2 nmol/kg/hr of neurotensin. Blood levels of C-terminal neurotensin-like immunoreactivity were proportional to the dose of peptide infused and were 52 fmol/ml during infusion of 0.24 nmol/kg/hr, a dose that significantly inhibited pentagastrin-induced acid secretion. Thus, a model has been developed to study the effect of neurotensin infusion on acid secretion; the concentration of plasma neurotensin-like immunoreactivity at which inhibition occurs in this model is similar to the concentration reported to occur after a nutrient stimulus.\r"

Repeat measures of gastric emptying were again obtained in these cats under the conditions of both acute and chronic ethanol exposure and 24 hr following ethanol withdrawal. Gastric emptying half times were prolonged significantly during acute and chronic exposure to ethanol. The mean value for t1/2 under control conditions was 46.46 min, while for acute and chronic exposure to ethanol the mean t1/2 values were 69.34 and 91.33 min, respectively. In addition, we demonstrated a similar delay in gastric emptying during active withdrawal from alcohol (t1/2 = 70). We conclude that both acute and chronic alcohol exposure significantly delay gastric emptying.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the rarity of the PV syndrome is due to compensatory up-regulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR), we measured changes in stomach mAChR and gastric acid secretion in dogs before and three weeks after truncal vagotomy. Maximum acid output dropped significantly one week PV and then partially recovered by three weeks PV. mAChR density changed in parallel and was significantly increased in body mucosa, body muscle, and antrum mucosa. In the body, changes in mAChR in mucosa correlated positively with changes in muscle, suggesting that mAChR binding in pinch biopsies of gastric mucosa might become useful in evaluating patients for postvagotomy syndrome. PV up-regulation of mAChR in the mucosa of the canine gastric body might explain PV recovery of gastric acid secretion.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of intravenous administration of terbutaline on plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), both of which are known to inhibit gastric acid secretion. Seven dogs with gastric and duodenal fistulas were given pentagastrin (1 microgram/kg/hr) intravenously for 150 min in combination with terbutaline (10 or 20 micrograms/kg/hr) or saline during the 60- to 120-min period of pentagastrin infusion. Pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited by intravenous administration of terbutaline. Terbutaline significantly increased plasma PYY levels, 24% in response to terbutaline at 10 micrograms/kg/hr, and 59% at 20 micrograms/kg/hr. Plasma GIP levels were also increased significantly, 24% with terbutaline at 10 micrograms/kg/hr, and 39% at 20 micrograms/kg/hr. Our data suggest that terbutaline-induced inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion is mediated, at least in part, by the release of PYY and GIP. The adrenergic nervous system may influence gastric acid secretion through the release of PYY and GIP.\r"

Under these conditions PCPGABA induces lesions dose-dependently (greater than 1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) in both the stomach and duodenum, and this action was dependent on BT; lowering of BT enhanced the ulcerogenicity. PCPGABA (3 mg/kg) had no effect on acid secretion at higher BT (36-38 degrees C) but produced a marked increase of acid output at lower BT (30-32 degrees C). 2DG caused a stimulation of acid output and gastric lesions without BT dependency, but the duodenal ulcerogenicity enhanced at lower BT. Gastric motility was enhanced significantly by these two agents to similar degrees, at either high or low BT. Neither PCPGABA nor 2DG affected alkaline secretion in the duodenum, while lowering of BT by itself reduced alkaline secretory responses. The above changes caused by PCPGABA and 2DG were blocked by both atropine and vagotomy. These results suggest that (1) acid stimulatory and ulcerogenic action of PCPGABA may involve a temperature-dependent process but does not relate to a cytoglycopenia, and (2) the vagus nerve mediating acid secretion and motility may be different in the temperature dependency.\r"

Cell damage was quantitated by chromium-51 release assay. Prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha were measured by radioimmunoassay. Total sulfhydryl content of cultured cells was determined calorimetrically. Microscopically, sucralfate was found to adhere tightly to epithelial cell surfaces despite frequent washings. Sucralfate 2 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml significantly decreased taurocholate-induced damage, reducing taurocholate-induced specific 51Cr release by 11.8 points (equal to 29% decrease in cell damage, P less than 0.01) and 22.9 points (equal to 56% decrease in cell damage, P less than 0.001), respectively. Sucrose octasulfate and aluminum hydroxide did not exert significant protection against damage induced by sodium taurocholate. The protective effect of sucralfate was not prevented by indomethacin, nor was it counteracted by the sulfhydryl blocker, iodoacetamide. Sucralfate, but not its components, significantly and dose-dependently stimulated prostaglandin E2 (r = 0.94, P less than 0.05) and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (r = 0.89, P less than 0.05) production by cultured cells. Neither sucralfate nor its components affected sulfhydryl content of cultured cells. In conclusion, sucralfate, but not its components, (1) protects rat gastric mucosal cells against taurocholate-induced damage in conditions independent of systemic factors and in a neutral environment and (2) significantly stimulates prostaglandin production by cultured cells. (3) The protection by sucralfate in vitro does not seem to depend on its stimulatory effect on endogenous prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

Twenty patients with constipation also underwent a colonic transit study with radioopaque markers, which identified one group with normal transit (N = 10) and another with slow transit (N = 10). Nine of 36 patients (25%) had inappropriate puborectalis muscle contraction or exhibited weak expulsion efforts during evacuation proctography, and these correlated highly with poor rectal emptying of barium paste (20 +/- 6% vs 61 +/- 5% in patients with normal relaxation; P less than 0.01). However, poor rectal emptying did not correlate with the presence of high-grade intussusceptions, large rectoceles, anorectal angles at rest or with straining, rectal diameter, clinical features, or colonic transit. Moreover, abnormal expulsion patterns as seen with anorectal manometry correlated poorly with the presence of inappropriate puborectalis contraction and decreased rectal emptying by proctography. Although anatomic abnormalities occurred frequently in patients with constipation and/or defecatory difficulties, they were also prevalent in asymptomatic controls. In view of these findings, surgical intervention to correct anatomic abnormalities in patients with constipation and/or defecatory difficulties should be considered only with great caution.\r"

Patients without colostomy and with normal rectal mucosa were used as controls. Autoradiography of in vitro labeled mucosal samples with [3H]thymidine was used. The proliferative activity in the rectal crypts was estimated by measuring labeling and mitotic indices, total DNA of isolated crypts, and total crypt cell numbers. One hundred forty days after creating a proximal end colostomy, labeling index (P less than 0.05), mitotic index (P less than 0.01), DNA content per crypt (P less than 0.05), and number of cells per crypt (P less than 0.05) decreased significantly compared to control values. Restoration of colorectal continuity resulted in a significant increase of the labeling index (P less than 0.05), the mitotic index (P less than 0.01), the DNA content per crypt (P less than 0.05), and the cell number per crypt (P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between the postclosure values and the controls. These data indicated that excluding the human rectal mucosa from fecal stream determined a mucosal atrophy that could be reversed by restoration of colorectal continuity.\r"

Moreover, the duration and magnitude of the intestinal motor response to stress are still ignored. Therefore, the aim of our work was to determine, in rat, the effect of long-duration stress induced by restraint on the motility of small bowel and colon. Observations were made during physical restraint and 60 h later. Bipolar electrodes were implanted on the gastrointestinal serosa from the pylorus to the sigmoid colon in male Wistar rats. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made during fasting state, and a control EMG recording session was performed during 12 hr, followed by a 12-hr recording during restraint stress. After a 60-hr resting period, another EMG recording session was performed during 3 hr. During stress in the pylorus and small bowel, the recurrence of migrating myoelectrical complexes (MMCs) was immediately interrupted and replaced by a continuous and irregular activity. The motility index (number of spike bursts/10 min) was augmented rapidly on the jejunum and ileum, but it increased only gradually on the pylorus. Only on the transverse colon were the number of spike bursts/hour and their relative duration increased after 7 hr of physical restraint. In contrast, the sigmoid colon displayed a gradual decrease in the relative duration of contractile activity during the first 6-7 hr of stress. At 60 hr after stress in the pylorus and small bowel, a normal control motor activity was restored (MMC, motility index) on the jejunum and on the ileum, but the motility index on the pylorus was decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we attempted to elucidate the direct action of adrenergic stimulation on pancreatic enzyme secretion. Rat pancreatic segments were set up in an organ bath and superfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) stimulated amylase release from the segments. This stimulation was subject to inhibition with atropine up to 80%. Atropine-resistant enzyme discharge in response to EFS could be blocked by propranolol. Cholinergic agonist urecholine-induced amylase release was completely blocked by atropine. Noradrenaline (NA) exhibited a biphasic effect on amylase release. It inhibited the urecholine-induced amylase release in lower concentrations (10(-8)-10(-7) M), while it stimulated basal enzyme secretion in higher concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M). The inhibitory effect was mimicked by phenylephrine and completely prevented by prazosin. Isoprenaline concentration dependently enhanced, while clonidine and guanfacine did not affect amylase discharge. In conclusion, in rat pancreatic acinar tissue it seems likely that acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter. Adrenergic action can be dual, inhibitory via alpha 1-adrenoceptors or stimulatory via beta-adrenoceptors on amylase secretion.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to evaluate selected psychosocial characteristics of contrasting groups of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), i.e., patients with persistently poor versus good glycemic control. Patients with chronic poor control reported feeling physically best at higher blood glucose levels than patients with good control. They also reported a higher threshold for physical symptoms caused by hyperglycemia without any difference in threshold for hypoglycemic symptoms. No differences between groups were found in level of diabetes knowledge, self-esteem, or psychiatric symptomatology. This study suggests that poorly controlled adult patients have underlying perceptions of hyperglycemic symptoms and physical well-being that distinguish them from patients with well-controlled diabetes. The design of this study does not allow for determination of the causal direction in this relationship. Although these patient reports about glycemic and physical symptoms may be post hoc justifications or unreliable beliefs, they also may be accurate perceptions of physical symptom experiences and therefore could influence their self-care activities with resulting chronic problems in glycemic control. Further research is needed to assess the validity of these observations and their possible role in long-term regulation of glycemia.\r"

Such a questionnaire was developed and implemented into the data collection scheme of the prospective Pima Indian Study of Arizona. The questionnaire, which assesses historical, past-year, and past-week leisure and occupational activity, was examined in 29 Pima individuals aged 21-36 yr and was shown to be reliable with test-retest correlations (rank-order correlations ranged from 0.62 to 0.96 for leisure and occupational activity). Reproducibility of the past-year leisure physical-activity estimate was determined in 69 participants aged 10-59 yr and was found to be reliable in all age-groups with the exception of the 10- to 14-yr-old age-group (rank-order correlations were 0.31 in the 10- to 14-yr-old age-group compared to 0.88 to 0.92 in those greater than 20 yr of age). Validity of the current-activity section of the questionnaire was demonstrated indirectly through comparisons with activity monitors. The past-week leisure-activity estimate was related to the Caltrac activity monitor counts per hour (rho = 0.62, P less than 0.05, n = 17). In summary, a physical-activity questionnaire has been developed that is both reliable and feasible to use in the Pima Indian population to evaluate the relationship of physical activity to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "The electroretinogram (ERG) elicited by alternating gratings at constant mean luminance (pattern ERG) is a focal response reflecting the activity of the directly stimulated retinal area. In addition, pattern ERG is related, unlike the flash ERG, to ganglion cell activity. Therefore, this technique may be used to evaluate the integrity of inner retinal layers in the macular region. In this study, the steady-state pattern ERG, in response to alternating gratings (1.7 cycles/deg spatial frequency; 9 degrees field size) temporally modulated at 8 Hz, was recorded in 42 type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with zero to four microaneurysms on fluorescein angiography and a duration of disease less than 11 yr. No patient had concomitant ocular or systemic complications. Mean pattern-ERG amplitude was significantly reduced in patients compared with age-matched control subjects (analysis of variance, F = 25.6, P less than 0.0001). Significant differences were observed between control and diabetic subjects without retinopathy (Scheffe F test, P less than 0.0001), between control and retinopathic subjects (Scheffe F test, P less than 0.0001), and between diabetic patients without retinopathy and those with early retinopathy (Scheffe F test, P less than 0.02). Pattern-ERG amplitude was inversely correlated with duration of diabetes (r = 0.22, P less than 0.05). Our results suggest a macular dysfunction in early diabetes resulting from metabolic and/or vascular injuries in the neurosensory retina.\r"

Based on survey data, an estimated 21.3 million visits were made for diabetes in 1985. Of these, 16.8 million were for continuing care of diabetes by primary-care physicians, an average of 2.7 visits/yr for the 6.1 million U.S. residents diagnosed as having diabetes. A test for blood glucose was associated with 69% of these visits, an average of 1.9 times/yr per patient with diabetes in the U.S. Rates of testing for blood glucose varied by source of payment for the visit and were higher when diabetes was the primary diagnosis and when the number of physicians practicing together was greater, such as in health maintenance organizations or group practices. Rates of testing did not differ by age, race, or sex of the patient; location of the physician's practice; whether insulin or oral agents were prescribed; or a number of other characteristics. Other studies indicate that self-monitoring of blood glucose is performed by less than 10% of diabetic patients. Hence, the physician's office remains an important location for assessment of diabetes control by measurement of blood glucose levels.\r"

The research design consisted of a case-control study conducted from a referral-based diabetes clinic at a major medical center. The patients were a 65% sample (163 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [IDDM] and 166 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM] patients) of all patients admitted during a 26-mo period. Neuropathy was diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms. Smoking history was obtained by mailed questionnaire (66% response rate). Diabetes duration, HbA1, age, sex, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension history, and lifetime alcohol consumption were measured as covariates. The prevalence of neuropathy was 49 and 38% in IDDM (n = 113) and NIDDM (n = 104) patients, respectively. In IDDM, but not NIDDM, current or ex-smokers were significantly more likely to have neuropathy than individuals who had never smoked (odds ratio 2.46, P = 0.02), and the prevalence of neuropathy increased with increasing number of pack-years smoked (P less than 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, IDDM patients smoking greater than or equal to 30 pack-yr were 3.32 times more likely to have neuropathy than patients smoking less than this amount (95% confidence interval 1.15-9.58, P = 0.026). Cigarette smoking was associated with the presence of neuropathy in this clinic-based population of IDDM patients. The hypothesis that cigarette smoking is associated with diabetic neuropathy should be investigated further, both prospectively and in a more representative population.\r"

Simple CHO, fiber, saturated fat, cholesterol, and polyunsaturated-saturated fat ratio were similar in the two diets. Total plasma cholesterol was not significantly affected by dietary changes; conversely, plasma triglyceride (1.38 +/- 0.59 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.39 mM, P less than 0.05) and apolipoprotein CII (3.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) increased significantly after the high-CHO low-fat diet. Among the various lipoproteins, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) was the most affected by diet: VLDL cholesterol concentrations increased from 0.30 +/- 0.19 to 0.43 +/- 0.28 mM (P less than 0.05), and triglyceride concentrations increased from 0.62 +/- 0.33 to 0.88 +/- 0.53 mM (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, increasing the amount of complex CHO in the diet induces an elevation of VLDL in normolipidemic, nonobese, mildly type II diabetic patients.\r"

Separation of large and small luteal cells by elutriation, followed by protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), have revealed that the 32K protein was present as a major protein in the large luteal cells but was practically absent in the small cell population. This protein appears to be highly tissue and cell specific and resolves into three protein species by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE with the major protein having an isoelectric point (pI) greater than or equal to 8.5. It was not detected in preantral follicles or placentas of the same pregnant rats, or in any other tissue examined. After subcellular fractionation, the 32K protein(s) was found in the particulate fraction and was localized principally in the microsomal compartment. Autoradiographic analysis of 35S-amino acid-labeled tissue demonstrated that the 32K protein(s) is synthesized in the corpus luteum. When particulate fractions from small and large cells were incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP followed by SDS-PAGE, phosphorylation of the 32K protein was apparent. Phosphorylation of this protein was not enhanced by the addition of cofactors for cAMP, Ca2(+)-calmodulin- or Ca2(+)-phospholipid-dependent kinases. Experimental inhibition of steroidogenesis with amino-glutethimide caused a remarkable reduction in the luteal content of this 32K protein whereas estradiol and human CG treatment increased its content. In summary, we have discovered and partially characterized a unique 32K protein(s) which is expressed and phosphorylated only in large luteal cells of the corpus luteum. This protein(s), which is regulated by estradiol formed locally, may serve as a powerful marker for both the large luteal cell and estrogen action in the corpus luteum.\r"

  ".W": "Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrp), a polypeptide synthesized by tumors associated with hypercalcemia and known to cause bone resorption, was examined for its effects on bone formation in cultures of 21-day fetal rat calvariae. Continuous treatment with PTHrp for 24-72 h stimulated DNA synthesis, but inhibited [3H] proline incorporation into collagen by about 50%. In contrast, transient exposure to PTHrp at 0.1-1.0 nM for 24 h followed by removal of the factor for 48 h caused an increase in [3H]proline incorporation into collagen and noncollagen protein by 2- and 1.6-fold, respectively. The stimulatory effect was seen in the periosteum-free bone, and was decreased, but not prevented by hydroxyurea. PTHrp at 1-10 nM for 24 h increased medium insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I levels by 2.5-4.4-fold, and the effect was sustained 48 h after the removal of the agent. An IGF I neutralizing antibody prevented the stimulatory effect of PTHrp on bone collagen synthesis. PTH had the same stimulatory effects as those of PTHrp on bone collagen synthesis and IGF I concentrations, although slightly lower doses were needed to observe the enhancement of [3H]proline incorporation into collagen. It is concluded that continuous treatment with PTHrp inhibits, whereas transient treatment stimulates, collagen synthesis; the stimulatory effect appears mediated by an enhancement in the local production of IGF I.\r"

Clearances were measured by an assay specific for intact PTH, and by assays specific for NH2-terminal, mid-molecule, and COOH-terminal immunoreactive PTH (iPTH). Production of PTH fragments was analyzed by HPLC. The kidneys cleared PTH mainly by filtration. The glomerular filtration rate was not lower at 4 mM calcium than at 1 mM calcium, and no significant differences were found between the clearance of PTH at 4 mM and at 1 mM calcium. At 1 mM calcium the kidneys cleared intact PTH without release of detectable fragments. At 4 mM calcium there was significant (P less than 0.05) accumulation of mid-molecule and COOH-terminal iPTH in the perfusate. Both at low and at high calcium the livers cleared NH2-terminal iPTH at the same rate as intact PTH, whereas mid-molecule and COOH-terminal iPTH was cleared significantly (P less than 0.005) slower. In the livers, metabolic clearance of PTH was 60% faster at 4 mM calcium than at 1 mM calcium (P less than 0.001). Assuming that the hepatic metabolism of PTH represents degradation of the biologically active hormone and hormone fragments, rather than activation of the hormone, the present results suggest a homeostatic control of PTH degradation in the liver to enhance inactivation of the hormone at high serum levels of calcium.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression at the protein level, we have produced an anti-serum to the GR using a 14 amino acid peptide (14-mer) of amino terminus domain of the human GR, and established a simple and specific RIA to quantitate both the human and rat GR. The antibody was raised in rabbits to the 14-mer coupled to either BSA or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This antibody immunoblots the Mr = 94,000 bona fide GR in tissue extracts and localizes the GR at the subcellular level by immunocytochemistry. In addition, cytosolic GR, previously labeled by the affinity ligand, [3H]dexamethasone mesylate, was immunoprecipitated by the peptide antibody. The 14-mer was iodinated at its tyrosine residue and used in a standard RIA. The binding of the antibody to the 125I-14-mer was displaced by increasing concentrations of either the 14-mer (standard curve) pure GR or tissue cytosol containing native GR. This RIA reliably detects glucocorticoid receptor level between 20 and 500 fmol/tube in human, rat, and mouse tissues. In two well established cell line systems and their subclones (human CEM and in rat hepatoma tissue culture cells transfected or not with GR cDNA) the GR level, as assessed by this RIA, was compared to GR values using the classical radioreceptor or previously published mRNA assays. The relative amount of GR in wild-type cells and in subclones, as assessed by the novel RIA, was identical to the above-mentioned assays. Using the RIA, we demonstrated the down-regulation of GR level in liver following glucocorticoid administration and its up-regulation following adrenalectomy. This study, which constitutes the first description of an RIA for a steroid receptor using a synthetic peptide, provides a powerful tool for a standardized, sensitive, and simple assay for the GR in human and animal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Digestion of covalently linked [125I]human (h) GH-receptor complexes with neuraminidase or endoglycosidase F reduced the mass of the principal hormone receptor complex from about 130 kilodaltons (kDa) to 120 and 110 kDa, respectively, suggesting that about 20% of the mass of the GH receptor of rat adipocytes consists of N-linked sialocarbohydrates. Incubation of adipocytes with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, decreased the incorporation of [35S]methionine into membrane glycoproteins by more than 50% in 4 h and decreased specific binding of [125I]hGH by about 70% after 8 h. Decreased binding and incorporation of [35S]methionine were seen only after a lag time of about 2 h. Cross-linking of [125I] hGH to cells that had been treated with tunicamycin resulted in the appearance of a new labeled species of hormone-receptor complex with an apparent mass of about 110 kDa. This band appeared after a delay of about 3 h and reached approximately equal prominence with the 130 kDa band at 5 h. By 8 h, the 110 kDa complex was the predominant band in radioautograms, but some of the 130 kDa species remained. Scatchard analysis of binding data in tunicamycin-treated adipocytes indicated that decreased binding of [125I]hGH resulted from a 3- to 4-fold decrease in affinity accompanied by only a small (30%) decline in receptor number. Tunicamycin did not affect the rate of receptor turnover in cells that were also treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, but receptor turnover decelerated with increasing time of incubation. Treatment with tunicamycin for 8 h markedly slowed the rate at which specifically bound [125I]hGH disappeared from adipocytes, suggesting that N-linked carbohydrates may play some role in internalization and processing of labeled hormone. We conclude that 1) N-linked carbohydrates contribute about 20 kDa to the apparent mass of the GH receptor of rat adipocytes; 2) N-linked glycosylation is not required for GH receptors to be inserted into the adipocyte membrane in the proper orientation and to retain their ability to recognize and bind GH; 3) N-linked sugar chains are required for maintenance of a normal high affinity of receptors for GH; 4) N-linked carbohydrates are necessary for normal rates of internalization and processing of bound hGH.\r"

However, a detailed analysis of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in these animals is lacking. In the present study, morning corticosteronemia was higher in obese rats of both sexes than in lean ones, whereas evening corticosteronemia was higher only in obese male rats. The HPA axis was further investigated using stressful stimuli. Immobilization, ether, and cold stresses resulted in greater corticosterone levels in obese than in lean animals. These abnormalities consisted in upward shifts of the corticosterone response in obese females and absolute increases in that of obese males, indicating that such alterations were more pronounced in obese male than obese female rats. Due to this, the putative origin of the increased corticosterone output of obese rats was studied in males. Greater levels of ACTH were reached in obese than in lean rats when submitted to a cold stress (6 C). Dexamethasone produced a complete suppression of corticosterone output in both lean and obese rats. During the recovery from such suppression, corticosterone levels rose to higher values in obese than in lean rats. This observation together with the greater cold-induced ACTH output in obese rats suggest that the increased activity of the HPA axis of these animals is of central origin. Whatever its precise etiology within the central nervous system, it is proposed that the increased HPA axis activity in obese rats and its resultant hypercorticism play a role in the establishment and maintenance of their syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Most metabolic disorders of genetically obese Zucker rats are reversed by adrenalectomy and are restored by corticosterone treatment, thus suggesting that a functional hypercorticosteronemic state is involved in the pathogenesis of the obesity syndrome in fa/fa rats. However, the hormone content and morphology of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis of this animal model have to our knowledge not yet been described. We, thus, investigated morphologically and morphometrically the hypothalamic regions involved in CRF synthesis and secretion in male fa/fa rats. To ascertain if the brain is selectively or uniformly affected, we studied the main nuclei of the lateral and mediobasal hypothalamus, i.e. arcuate, lateral hypothalamic, and ventromedial nucleus and the parvicellular portion of the paraventricular nucleus. Moreover, after immunocytochemical labeling, we analyzed densitometrically the CRF-bearing axons of the median eminence and the ACTH-containing cells of the anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. Finally, we investigated the adrenal glands by qualitative light microscopy. In fa/fa rats most hypothalamic nuclei were structurally changed. Furthermore, hypothalamic CRF and anterior pituitary ACTH contents as well as adrenal weight were increased, the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex was hypertrophic, and the ACTH content of the intermediate lobe was reduced. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the obesity syndrome in genetically obese fa/fa rats is associated with lesions of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis consistent with hyperadrenocorticism due to hyperactivity of the whole adrenal axis. Alterations also occur in the hypothalamic nuclei controlling glycemia, insulinemia, and circadian corticosterone secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90200893\r", 
  ".W": "A substantial body of experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT) and several synthetic 5-HT receptor agonists activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To explore the mechanism(s) by which 5-HT or 5-HT agonists enhance the activity of the HPA axis in vitro, we examined the stimulatory effects of the 5-HT1a agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the 5-HT1c/5-HT1b agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), and the 5-HT2/5-HT1c agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-amino-propane (DOI) on plasma ACTH and corticosterone secretion in the rat. To test whether 8-OH-DPAT, m-CPP, or DOI increase plasma ACTH levels by stimulating the release of endogenous CRH, catheterized conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with hyperimmune CRH rabbit serum (TS-6) or normal rabbit serum and subsequently challenged with a maximally stimulatory dose of the above 5-HT agonists. Pretreatment with TS-6 completely suppressed the ACTH response to m-CPP and significantly blunted the responses to 8-OH-DPAT or DOI. To examine whether the remaining ACTH response to 8-OH-DPAT or DOI was also mediated by a pituitary site of action, we administered each of these agents to pituitary stalk-transected or sham-operated rats. The ACTH responses to 8-OH-DPAT and DOI in stalk-transected rats were preserved, although significantly blunted, compared to those in sham-operated rats. This suggested that both of these 5-HT agonists may also act at the pituitary level to stimulate ACTH release in vivo. Although the ACTH responses to 8-OH-DPAT, m-CPP, and DOI were blunted after both TS-6 pretreatment and pituitary stalk transection, corticosterone responses were only slightly affected, suggesting that some of these compounds may cause corticosterone release in the rat through another mechanism. To evaluate this hypothesis, ACTH and corticosterone responses to 8-OH-DPAT, m-CPP, and DOI were examined in rats whose HPA axis had been suppressed by a single high dose injection of dexamethasone. The corticosterone responses to 8-OH-DPAT and DOI were blunted compared to those of saline-pretreated rats, but were inappropriately high compared to the ACTH responses observed in these rats. On the other hand, both ACTH and corticosterone responses to m-CPP were completely abolished by dexamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90200896\r", 
  ".W": "Indirect evidence suggests that the serum GH-binding protein (GH-BP) is related and possibly derived from the GH-receptor. GH, through its specific receptor, is the major regulator of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) synthesis. The present study was undertaken to correlate serum GH-BP activity with liver plasma membrane GH receptors and their effects on serum IGF-I concentration during spontaneous pulsation of rat (r)GH in the normal male rat and after continuous delivery of human (h)GH to hypophysectomized male rats. In the first set of experiments, 45-day-old male rats were decapitated at 15 min intervals for 4 h. Serum GH-BP levels fluctuated with a 60 min lag behind the rGH levels. IGF-I pulsated over a 3-fold concentration range. IGF-I peak levels coincided with one of the rGH peaks, but its periodicity was longer than 3 h. Taken together with our previous studies on the turnover of the GH receptors, we suggest that each GH surge results in individual pulse-related turnover wave of receptor internalization and recycling. This is accompanied by a parallel increase in serum GH-BP activity. The GH and the receptor wave are responsible for an individual secretion pulse of IGF-I. In the second set of experiments male rats were hypophysectomized at 35 days of age. Four days later osmotic minipumps were implanted for continuous delivery of hGH. After 6 days of hGH treatment the rats were killed, blood was collected for hGH, GH-BP, and IGF-I determination, and the livers were removed. Plasma membranes were prepared, and lactogenic and somatogenic binding of [125I]hGH was evaluated. Removal of endogenous ligand was performed by exposing the membranes to 3 M MgCl2. Continuous administration of hGH induced a dose-dependent increase in liver membrane lactogenic and somatogenic binding. Parallel to that increase, serum GH-BP also increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the correlation between serum GH-BP and the liver membrane receptor was significant. Furthermore, hGH induced a dose-dependent increase in IGF-I concentration. There was a close correlation between IGF-I concentration and liver somatogenic receptors. It is concluded that up-regulation of the liver membrane GH receptors is accompanied by increased GH-BP and IGF-I. In both the pulsation experiment and the continuous infusion experiment, GH-BP closely correlated with the liver membrane GH receptor.\r"

On day 0, serum FFA concentrations and mean serum LH concentrations and number and amplitude of LH pulses, as assessed in blood samples collected every 12 min for 4 h, were 6.4 +/- 0.6 mg/100 ml, 0.57 +/- 0.08 ng/ml, 0.45 +/- 0.09 pulses/h, and 0.73 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, respectively. Double the maintenance feeding, beginning day 1, increased (P less than 0.01) body weights by 16% and LH pulse frequency by 82%, but had no effect (P greater than 0.1) on FFA concentrations, mean LH concentrations, or LH pulse amplitude by day 14.

GH pulse amplitude was highly variable and unaffected (P greater than 0.1) by treatment.

  ".W": "We have investigated the actions of human PTH [hPTH-(1-34)] on the association of 45Ca2+ with two human (SaOS-2 and MG-63) and two rat (ROS 17/2.8 and UMR-106) osteoblast-like cell types. In SaOS-2 cells, hPTH-(1-34) binds to specific membrane receptors to activate adenylate cyclase. Treatment of SaOS-2 cells with hPTH-(1-34) resulted in an increase in 45Ca2+ uptake, in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 2- to 4-fold above control values. The increase was first evident at 10 min and persisted for at least 30 min. Treatment with nimodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, was without effect on the stimulatory action of PTH. A similar enhancement of cell-associated 45Ca2+ was observed when the cells were incubated with vasoactive intestinal peptide, which acts via different receptors to activate adenylate cyclase in SaOS-2 cells. Treatment with (Bu)2cAMP also induced an increase in cell-associated 45Ca2+. Pretreatment of SaOS-2 cells with hPTH-(1-34) for 4 h, which induced homologous desensitization to a second challenge with the same peptide for stimulation of cAMP production, did not attenuate the further enhancement of cell-associated 45Ca2+ by a second treatment with hPTH-(1-34). We then examined a possible relationship between alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) and 45Ca2+ uptake. SaOS-2 cells contained high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and continuously released the enzyme into the medium. Release was enhanced by treatment with hPTH-(1-34) for 10 min. Incubation of cells with levamisole (an inhibitor of the liver/bone/kidney type of ALPase) resulted in a rapid decrease in basal and PTH-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake, while treatment with L-Phe-Gly-Gly (an inhibitor of human placental ALPase) was without effect. Treatment of the cells with ALPase (bovine kidney) enhanced 45Ca2+ uptake. In MG-63 cells, a stimulatory effect of hPTH-(1-34) on cell-associated 45Ca2+ was also observed; however, hPTH-(1-34) did not stimulate cAMP production in MG-63 cells. In ROS 17/2.8 cells, neither hPTH-(1-34) nor rat PTH-(1-34) stimulated an increase in cell-associated 45Ca2+, while in UMR-106 cells, rat PTH-(1-34) and (Bu)2cAMP did enhance 45Ca2+ uptake, although hPTH-(1-34) was without effect. We conclude that PTH can stimulate an increase in cell-associated 45Ca2+ in several osteoblast-like cell lines, possibly by modulating local ALPase activity; however, this action of PTH does not appear to be obligatorily dependent on the adenylate cyclase-stimulating action of PTH.\r"

  ".W": "Thermogenesis in rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) is thyroid hormone responsive. Rat BAT expresses a type II 5'-iodothyronine monodeiodinase (5'MDI) which mediates local T3 production from T4. Earlier studies show that BAT from fetal and newborn sheep contains a high Km type I, instead of type II, 5'MDI. To better characterize the 5'MDI of ovine fetal BAT, we studied the in vitro monodeiodination of [125I]T4 at a low substrate concentration (2 nM) and in the presence of 1 mM propylthiouracil in BAT homogenates of control and thyroidectomized fetuses at different gestational ages as well as in newborn lambs. Thyroidectomies were performed at three gestational ages: 99-107 days (group 1), 129-132 days (group 2), and 115-117 days (group 3A). Animals were studied 8-13 days after surgery. A significant increase in the activity of a low Km T4 5'MDI was noted in BAT from hypothyroid fetuses at all three gestational ages. This low Km activity was similar to the type II enzyme in rat BAT and brain in that the activity was also T3 resistant. A gradual rise in BAT type II 5'MDI activity was measured between 99 days gestation and term (150 days). These results indicate that ovine BAT contains two distinct iodothyronine 5'-monodeiodinating activities, one with a high Km and another with a low Km. The latter, resembling the type II 5'MDI in rat brain and BAT, is increased in ovine hypothyroid BAT. The former predominates in euthyroid tissue and is similar to the type I 5'MDI characterized in rat liver, kidney, and thyroid. We speculate that BAT type II 5'MDI may be important for neonatal BAT thermogenesis, while the type I enzyme may play a significant role in the increase in serum T3 concentration that occurs at birth.\r"

Plasma ACTH was increased from 30-90 min after insulin treatment in all experiments. The ACTH responses to hypoglycemia were inhibited by cortisol infusions of 9 or 18 micrograms/kg.min beginning at 0 min [mean ACTH from 30-90 min: after vehicle, 557 +/- 57 (+/- SEM); after cortisol, 221 +/- 20 and 201 +/- 48 pg/ml, respectively], but the overall responses were not significantly reduced by infusions beginning 20, 30, or 60 min after the injection of insulin. The latency of the inhibition was 30 min after the infusions beginning at 0 min and 40-50 min after cortisol infusions beginning at later times. The infusion of cortisol also significantly reduced basal ACTH; however, this inhibition was not significant until 40 min. In further experiments the ACTH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was measured after infusing 45 micrograms/kg cortisol over 2, 5, or 15 min at rates of 22.5, 9, or 3 micrograms/kg.min. These infusions caused suppression of plasma ACTH by 30 min, but there was no significant difference in the degree of suppression (mean ACTH from 30-90 min: after vehicle, 532 +/- 34; cortisol for 2 min, 223 +/- 34; cortisol for 5 min, 197 +/- 18; cortisol for 15 min, 181 +/- 36 pg/ml).

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that anterior pituitary corticotropes can be identified cytochemically by their capacity to bind potent biotinylated analogs of CRH. In addition, 50-80% of corticotropes bind biotinylated arginine vasopressin (AVP). The percentage of CRH-bound cells is rapidly reduced after 1-h exposure to glucocorticoids. However, the rapid effects of glucocorticoids on AVP binding by corticotropes have not been tested. The first aim of this study was to examine the binding capacity of small and large corticotropes enriched to 90% by counterflow centrifugation. Biotinylated analogs of CRH or AVP were detected cytochemically on the cells by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex protocols. At least 80% of the cells bound CRH after 1 day of culture. More large corticotropes bound AVP (93%) than small corticotropes (80%). AVP pretreatment of large corticotropes stimulated an increase in CRH-bound cells to over 90%, but it had no effect on CRH binding by small corticotropes. Corticosterone pretreatment (100 nM) for 10 min caused a 50% reduction in the percentage of cells that bound CRH and in the levels of ACTH released in response to biotinylated CRH. After 30 and 60 min of pretreatment, the percentages of CRH-bound cells were reduced by 75%, and ACTH levels remained low. No reduction in percentages of AVP-bound cells was evident at any time point after corticosterone pretreatment. These studies stimulated further tests based on previous reports that showed that AVP or its activated second messengers enhanced CRH binding. We reasoned that this potentiation might promote a recovery in CRH binding to corticosterone-inhibited cells. However, 1-h stimulation by AVP or activation of calcium channels (by Bay K 8644) or protein kinase-C by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate did not restore CRH binding. AVP evoked a partial recovery in ACTH release. Furthermore, Bay K and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate pretreatment effectively blocked the fast feedback effects of corticosterone on CRH-mediated ACTH release. Thus, these studies demonstrate that glucocorticoids rapidly inhibit CRH-receptor binding in a domain that is not affected by AVP potentiation of ACTH release. Perhaps they immobilize transport processes needed to bring unoccupied CRH receptors to the surface for binding and cytochemical detection.\r"

When analytical chromatography on a 1.6 x 100 cm column was performed, four peaks of radioactivity were revealed: the first two peaks with Mr +/- 220,000 and +/- 110,000 corresponded to bound 125I-bGH (abolished by excess of unlabeled bGH), the third corresponded to free 125I-bGH and the fourth to free Na125I (Vt). On a short (1 x 40 cm) column, bound 125I-bGH eluted as a single peak between the void volume (Vo) and the peak of free 125I-bGH. Serum 125I-bGH binding was specific, saturable, and time-dependent. Specific serum 125I-bGH binding (bound/total radioactivity x 100), calculated as the difference of binding in the absence and the presence of an excess unlabeled bGH, was higher in female than in male rats (26 +/- 2% vs. 11 +/- 1%, respectively; mean +/- SE; n = 6; P less than 0.01). Scatchard analysis revealed a binding affinity of 2 x 10(8) M-1 for both sexes, and a binding capacity of 6.4 x 10(-8) mol/liter for the female rats and 1.6 x 10(-8) mol/liter for the male rats (mean of three serum pools of three animals each). Specific binding of 125I-bGH to serum correlated significantly with 125I-bGH binding to liver homogenates (r = 0.83; n = 12; P less than 0.01). These results suggest the presence of a specific GH-binding protein in rat serum and provide further evidence for a close relationship between serum GH-binding protein and hepatic GH receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has been implicated as a physiological PRL-releasing factor; however, characterization of VIP receptors on normal pituitaries using radioligand-binding methods has been problematic. In this study we demonstrated specific receptors for VIP in anterior pituitary glands of female rats using HPLC-purified monoiodinated [Tyr(125I)10]VIP. Binding of VIP was reversible, saturable to receptor and radioligand, regulated by guanine nucleotides, and dependent on time and temperature. Scatchard analysis of competitive binding studies indicated high and low affinity binding sites, with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.19 +/- 0.03 and 28 +/- 16 nM, respectively. The corresponding maximum numbers of binding sites were 158 +/- 34 fmol/mg and 11.7 +/- 6.9 pmol/mg. Binding was specific, as peptides with structural homology to VIP were less than 100th as potent as VIP. The rank order of potency of the peptides tested was VIP greater than rat (r) peptide histidine isoleucine = human (h) PHI greater than rGRF greater than bovine GRF = porcine PHI = VIP-(10-28) greater than hGRF greater than secretin greater than apamin greater than glucagon. Radioligand binding was associated primarily with lactotrope-enriched fractions prepared by unit gravity sedimentation of dispersed anterior pituitary cells. VIP stimulated PRL release from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells, with an ED50 of 1 nM. These results, comprising the first identification of specific VIP receptors in normal rat anterior pituitary tissue using radioligand-binding methods, provide additional support for a biological role of VIP in lactotrope function.\r"

Methoxamine was more potent in stimulating ACTH secretion when injected icv than peripherally, suggesting that the stimulant alpha 1-adrenoceptors are located in the brain rather than in the periphery. In order to investigate the relative roles of hypothalamic CRF-41 and vasopressin as mediators of the stimulant effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptors on ACTH secretion, we examined the effects of equipotent doses of antagonists to CRF-41 and vasopressin on the ACTH responses to methoxamine. The effect of methoxamine was reduced by the vasopressin antagonist dPTyr(Me) arginine vasopressin but not by the CRF-41 antagonist alpha-helical CRF-9-41, suggesting that vasopressin is more important than CRF-41 in mediating the effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptors on ACTH secretion. However, the combination of the two antagonists caused a reduction in the ACTH response to methoxamine that was greater than that of the vasopressin antagonist alone. This suggested that CRF-41 plays some role in this response, possibly by enhancing the activity of vasopressin in a synergistic manner. These two hypothalamic peptides seem to account for most of the ACTH releasing activity of alpha 1 adrenoceptor activation.\r"

  ".U": "90200907\r", 
  ".W": "Extracellular calcium (Ca2+) is the major physiological regulator of parathyroid function; high Ca2+ decreases PTH secretion as well as reduces cAMP accumulation. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting the presence of a receptor-like mechanism at the surface of the parathyroid cell which mediates these and other actions of Ca2+. In the present studies we used the lectin Concanavalin-A (Con-A) to investigate the possible role of carbohydrate moieties in the regulation of cAMP metabolism by Ca2+ in bovine parathyroid cells, which is thought to involve inhibition of adenylate cyclase via activation of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein Gi. Pretreatment of parathyroid cells with Con-A for 15-60 min significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of high Ca2+ on dopamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation, reducing the inhibition at 3 mM Ca2+ from 70 +/- 3% to 30 +/- 3%. This effect was also observed in the absence of preincubation and with concentrations of Con-A as low as 40 micrograms/ml and was reversed by alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, a specific antagonist of the lectin. The lectin also reversed the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ (2-3 mM) on cAMP accumulation stimulated by isoproterenol and forskolin to a comparable extent. Prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation (likewise mediated by Gi) was, however, not reversed by Con-A, suggesting that the lectin did not have a generalized effect on the cell surface or on receptors inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Moreover, fluoride-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation was not reversed by Con-A, providing additional evidence that the lectin did not act at or distal to Gi (i.e. modulate Gi, adenylate cyclase, and/or phosphodiesterase). The present study suggests that Con-A may modulate the actions of extracellular Ca2+ on parathyroid secretion, possibly modifying the interaction of Ca2+ with the cell surface by affecting carbohydrate moieties that seem to be important in the Ca2(+)-sensing process. The structural element involved in Ca2+ sensing in the parathyroid cell may be a glycoprotein or closely associated with glycoproteins with carbohydrate chains containing alpha-methyl-D-glycoside.\r"

Relative rates of hormone degradation by rapidly equilibrating tissues such as liver and kidney and slowly equilibrating tissues such as muscle, skin, and brain could not be determined using serum data alone. Based on known physiology, all hormone losses were confined to rapidly equilibrating sites. Dogs had significantly higher mean serum total rT3 (175% that in man), free fraction of rT3 (437%), and free rT3 levels (765%). Total rT3 values were determined in different assays, due to species differences, which had similar anti-rT3 antiserum characteristics and rT3 standards. Fractional rates of rT3 transfer from serum to both rapidly and slowly equilibrating pools in dogs were not significantly different from those in man, while the fractional transfer rate from the rapid pool to serum was increased (288%). This was associated with significantly smaller rapid and slow pool extravascular binding (rapid, 3.8%; slow, 2.8%), mass (29% and 21%, respectively), and volume (17% and 12%, respectively) in dogs compared to man. In dogs, 31% of the total 0.791 micrograms rT3 was in serum, 29% was in the rapid pool, and 40% was in the slow pool compared to 16% of 2.677 micrograms in serum, 29% in the rapid pool, and 55% in the slow pool in man (P less than 0.01). Further, 89% of the total unidirectional transfer from serum was to the rapid pool, and 11% to the slow pool in dogs compared to 82% and 18%, respectively, in man. Serum clearance (22%) and appearance rates (39%) as well as maximum total body production rates (34%) of rT3 were lower in the dogs. Serum appearance and maximum production rates, and hormone masses in the rapid and slow pools were no longer significantly different between dogs and man when normalized for either body weight or body surface area. Serum volume was no longer significant when normalized for body surface area. Noncompartmental analysis resulted in a significant underestimation of the mean total fraction rate of hormone exit from serum (by 20%), total volume of distribution (10%), extravascular binding (18%), and mean residence time (11%) in dogs and of extravascular binding (22%) in man. The serum appearance rate of rT3 was 78% of the maximum total body production rate in dogs and 69% in man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The parathyroid cell is unusual, in that an increase in extracellular calcium concentrations inhibits PTH release. Calcium channels are glycoproteins that span cell membranes and allow entry of extracellular calcium into cells. We have demonstrated that the calcium channel agonist (+)202-791, which opens calcium channels, inhibits PTH release and that the antagonist (-)202-791, which closes calcium channels, stimulates PTH release. To identify the calcium channels responsible for these effects, we used a radioligand that specifically binds to calcium channels. Bovine parathyroid cell membranes were prepared and incubated under reduced lighting with [125I] iodipine (SA, 2000 Ci/mmol), which recognizes 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters. Nonspecific binding was measured by the inclusion of nifedipine at 10 microM. Specific binding represented approximately 40% of the total binding. The optimal temperature for [125I] iodipine binding was 4 C, and binding reached equilibrium by 30 min. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was approximately 550 pM, and the maximum number of binding sites was 780 fmol/mg protein. Both the calcium channel agonist (+)202-791 and antagonist (-)202-791 competitively inhibited [125I] iodipine binding, with 50% inhibition concentrations of 20 and 300 nM, respectively. These data indicate the presence of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels on parathyroid cell membranes.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of the uterus to the regulation of PRL secretion in lactating dams and cycling female rats was investigated. Lactating animals were hysterectomized or sham operated 2 days after parturition, and the number of pups was adjusted to eight. Blood samples for PRL RIA were obtained through intra-atrial cannulae implanted 2 days before experimentation. In order to study the PRL secretory profile in undisturbed freely lactating rats, blood samples were taken every 2 h for 24 h starting at 1400 h. During early lactation (days 7-8), hysterectomy did not alter the PRL secretory profile compared to that of sham-operated controls. On days 14-15 post partum, PRL secretion followed a characteristic bimodal pattern showing two PRL surges at 1800 h and 0600 h. After hysterectomy, the early morning PRL surge disappeared and PRL secretion showed an unimodal daily rhythm reaching its peak at 1800 h. The possible effect of the absence of the uterus on suckling-induced PRL release at various stages of lactation was studied. On days 7-8, suckling stimuli after 4 h of pup deprivation induced robust PRL release. Hysterectomy did not significantly alter PRL release at this earlier stage of lactation. In control groups, the suckling-induced PRL secretory response markedly declined as the postpartum period advanced. On the other hand, the hysterectomized animals retained significantly greater responsiveness to suckling during the second half of lactation. These data indicate an inhibitory influence of the uterus on PRL secretion. The onset of this uterine effect is considerably delayed, and its influence became prominent only at a later phase of lactation. The effect of length of pup deprivation preceding the suckling stimulus, in combination with hysterectomy, was also investigated. Hysterectomy significantly increased suckling-induced PRL release after 4 and 24 h separation compared to the sham-hysterectomized animals. When the separation was longer than 48 h, the inducibility of PRL release by suckling declined and was not influenced by hysterectomy. In order to study the possible influence of the uterus on PRL secretion during the estrous cycle, regularly cycling female rats were hysterectomized at diestrus 1. Twelve days later the animals were cannulated, and serial blood samples were taken during the subsequent proestrus. Hysterectomy did not alter the PRL surge which occurred on the afternoon of proestrus indicating that the uterus does not have a major function in regulating PRL secretion on proestrus. In conclusion, hysterectomy significantly delayed the extinction of suckling-induced PRL release revealing the active role of the uterus in the regulation of this neuroendocrine reflex.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relationship between PRL and the mitogenic capacity of lymphocytes, we studied the relationships among circulating PRL levels, somatic growth, and the response of splenic lymphocytes to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in hamsters. In the first experiment, no differences were observed in the PHA responses of lymphocytes removed from intact or hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters. No relationships were observed between circulating PRL levels and either the PHA responses or somatic growth. However, significant positive correlations were observed between the somatic growth of intact or hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters and the PHA responses (r = 0.741; P less than 0.01 for intact hamsters; r = 0.642; P less than 0.01 for hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters). In three subsequent experiments we tested the effects of placing muscle or hypophysial allografts in hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters on somatic growth, the PHA responses, and circulating PRL levels. Neither type of allograft altered the somatic growth of hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters. The hypophysial allografts did elevate serum PRL levels. In all experiments the responses of splenic lymphocytes to PHA showed a significant positive correlation with somatic growth, but not with serum PRL levels. These results minimize a role of PRL in this particular lymphocyte response. The results suggest that a strong correlation exists between mechanisms responsible for somatic growth in hypophysectomized-orchidectomized hamsters and the immune status, as determined by the response to PHA, of the animals. This relationship also may exist in intact hamsters.\r"

The recent discovery of pro-S-(1-10) (antrin) as a prominent mature product in the stomach suggests that pro-S may also be processed at the N-terminus. In the present study we have developed an antibody directed against the N-terminal segment of pro-S-(1-10) capable of detecting peptides extended at the C-terminus of pro-S-(1-10) to characterize N-terminal processing of rat pro-S. Specifically, we have 1) examined the relative abundance of pro-S-(1-10)-like immunoactivity [pro-S-(1-10)] in different somatostatin tissues as an index of tissue-specific N-terminal processing, 2) compared the concentrations of pro-S N- and C-terminal immunoreactive peptides, 3) used HPLC and region-specific RIAs directed against both the N- and C-terminal segments of pro-S to identify and characterize novel N-terminal peptides, 4) studied the tissue distribution and release of the N-terminal peptides; and 5) characterized and quantified a 7-kDa molecule equivalent to pro-S without the C-terminal S-28 sequence. Acetic acid (1 M)-pepstatin extracts of hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, antrum, jejunal mucosa, and pancreas were fractionated by reverse phase and gel permeation HPLCs. Whole tissue extracts as well as the column effluent were monitored by region-specific RIAs using antibodies against pro-S-(1-10), S-28-(1-12), and S-14. Other than the pancreas, all S-producing tissues were rich in pro-S-(1-10) LI. Its concentration was 1- to 4-fold lower than those of S-14 LI and S-28-(1-12) LI. Tissue pro-S-(1-10) LI was heterogeneous, consisting of at least eight molecular forms with respective mol wt of 1,000 (1 kDa), 1,500 (1.5 kDa), 2,500 (2.5 kDa), 3,500 (3.5 kDa), 4,500 (4.5 kDa), 7,000 (7 kDa), 8,000 (8 kDa), and 10,000 (10 kDa). Based on the simultaneous presence or absence of C-terminal immunoreactivity, the 10-kDa form corresponded to pro-S, 8 kDa to pro-S-(1-76), and 7 kDa to pro-S without the S-28 sequence. The predominant N-terminal forms corresponded to 1 kDa [pro-S-(1-10)] and 7 kDa. The 1-, 1.5-, 2.5-, and 7-kDa forms were identified as secretion products in portal blood or in medium from cultured 1027 B2 islet somatostatin cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In addition, IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA concentrations in liver and lung were measured by specific solution hybridization assays to determine if changes in steady state levels of mRNA correlate with changes in serum values. Fetal serum IGF-I concentrations were 30% lower in fasted than in control fetuses, although fasting did not significantly reduce the abundance of IGF-I mRNA in their livers or lungs. Serum IGF-I concentrations in the fasted dams were 34% lower than those in controls. IGF-I mRNA concentrations in the livers and lungs of the fasted dams were also lower than those in controls and correlated with serum IGF-I values (liver: r = 0.833; P less than 0.001; lung: r = 0.610; P less than 0.05). Therefore, whereas IGF-I appears to be transcriptionally regulated by fasting in dams, regulation of circulating IGF-I in fetuses may occur at a post-transcriptional step. Serum IGF-II and liver IGF-II mRNA concentrations were much higher than IGF-I levels in the fetuses and were not influenced by maternal fasting. Dam serum IGF-II concentrations were low compared to those in fetal serum and also were not reduced by fasting. We conclude that one mechanism by which maternal malnutrition causes intrauterine growth retardation is through decreased expression of IGF-I. On the other hand, short term nutrient restriction does not appear to be a regulator of IGF-II during either fetal or adult life.\r"
