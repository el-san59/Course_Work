  ".W": "In the process of developing a two-part therapist rating scale, we obtained questionnaire responses from a large sample of subjects who had undergone one of a variety of psychotherapies. Our data support the importance of perceived therapist care as a strong correlate of patient satisfaction, and patients seemed able to discriminate clearly between psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapies. In the first (nonspecific) questionnaire, we derived five dimensions (Care-Concern, Directive-Control, Critical-Confronting, Understanding, and Charisma) from principal-components analyses, with the first two dimensions being relatively independent of each other. A multiple-regression analysis revealed that combined scale scores accounted for 50% of the variance of patient satisfaction ratings, with the Care dimension accounting for most of this effect. In the second questionnaire, data were analyzed from respondents who had undergone therapy with known cognitive-behavioral or psychodynamic therapists; but, in a minority of subjects who were recruited through the media, we depended on detailed descriptive vignettes to allocate them to one or another of these \"specific\" types of psychotherapy. Six scales emerged, three characterizing cognitive-behavioral therapies (Behavioral Task Orientation, Organization, and Cognitive Focus) and three representing psychodynamic therapies (Transference, Inner Conflict, and Relationship). Subjects' ratings on all scales strongly discriminated between the two broad modalities of therapy, suggesting that patient reports may provide valid measures of therapist styles. We conclude that questionnaires such as the one we are developing may provide economical measures for assessing therapist consistency when comparing different modalities of psychotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Although the mental health of recently employed persons has been well studied, the mental health of welfare recipients is not well understood. Among our increasing refugee population, many receive welfare benefits at some point. The Hmong are among those who are highly represented among welfare recipients in several areas of the United States. Do psychiatrists have anything to contribute toward the resolution of high welfare rates? This question is especially relevant in refugee populations who are at increased risk for several psychiatric disorders, including depression, paranoia, and adjustment disorders. This study was undertaken among 100 Hmong refugees who had been in the United States for 8 years. Indices of mental health included two rating scales (the Zung Depression Scale and the SCL-90), five-axis DSM-III diagnoses, Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scales, Global Assessment Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Inpatient Multidimensional Scale, and Mini-Mental State Exam. These indices were compared with current welfare status and the duration of time on welfare. Other comparisons with welfare included demographic characteristics, material possessions, acculturation characteristics, health and social problems, and nonoccupation avocations. Results indicate that welfare recipients show lower acculturation and elevated psychiatric symptom levels. Suggestions for ameliorating this situation are extrapolated from studies in the literature on chronically unemployed persons.\r"

However, if such patients do not report subjective fear, they may be less likely to receive a panic diagnosis. The authors studied 32 subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries who fit panic disorder criteria. A total of 13 (41%) reported no fear during their last major attack. These subjects were contrasted with those who did report fear. Few differences were found in group demographic data or responses to self-report questionnaires. We conclude that there appear to be few differences between the nonfear panic disorder subjects and those who do report fear. This conclusion awaits further support using challenge tests, medication trials, biological indices, alexithymia inventories, and family studies. The recognition of the existence of this subtype is likely to increase the number of patients receiving the panic disorder diagnosis in cardiology settings, in psychiatric settings, and in research projects using structured clinical interviews.\r"

The DSM-III requires that they include at least four associated symptoms and occur at least weekly for a diagnosis of panic disorder. This study of panic symptoms and frequency in 68 panic sufferers addresses the validity of these DSM-III requirements in terms of symptom patterns and phobic avoidance. Using chi-square, Fisher, and t-test analyses, this study found no clinical distinction between frequent (occurring at least weekly) and infrequent panic attacks. When comparing limited-symptom attacks (associated with less than four symptoms) with full-blown panic attacks, as expected, symptom frequencies were greater (p less than .05) in full-blown attacks, with the exceptions of feelings of unreality and fear of dying, going crazy, or losing control. Phobic avoidance did not differ between limited-symptom and full-blown attacks. This study not only demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the DSM-III requirements for a diagnosis of panic disorder but recognizes the importance of limited-symptom attacks to the development of agoraphobia.\r"

The cyclothymics exhibited significantly higher levels of depressive symptomatology and extraversion and had a higher rate of bipolar I disorder in their first-degree relatives than the dysthymics. In addition, a significantly greater proportion of cyclothymics than dysthymics had a family history of drug abuse. The groups did not differ significantly on gender, overall rates of affective disorders in relatives, or a number of symptoms which have been reported to distinguish unipolar and bipolar depressives. Although these data require replication due to the small sample and large number of analyses conducted, they provide at least partial support for extending the unipolar-bipolar distinction to the characterological mood disorders.\r"

The median time to recurrence of symptoms requiring some form of medical treatment was 2 years. Following repeat PRGR for recurrent symptoms, the median time to recurrence was 1 year. Univariate log rank statistics and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed significant associations between favorable outcome and female sex, absence of atypical features or associated cluster headache symptoms, success of prior carbamazepine therapy, duration of symptoms, and cerebrospinal fluid return during the procedure. A scoring system using prognostic factors has been developed based upon these findings. Assessment of published studies of PRGR and of other treatments for trigeminal neuralgia is made difficult by the variety of outcome measures employed and variable follow-up intervals. The present study attempts to address these issues by definition of endpoints, statistical analysis of the data, and identification of important prognostic factors in a manner useful to the clinician.\r"

  ".U": "90250475\r", 
  ".W": "Interventional neurovascular techniques for treating patients with intracranial aneurysms are now being performed in selected cases. In certain anatomical locations that are difficult to reach surgically, such as the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), this technique may be especially useful. The procedure is performed from a transfemoral approach, using local anesthesia, thus permitting continuous neurological monitoring. Between 1981 and 1989, 87 patients diagnosed as having an intracavernous aneurysm were treated with endovascular detachable balloon embolization techniques. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 84 years. The presenting symptom was mass effect in 69 cases (79.3%), rupture of a preexisting aneurysm resulting in a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula in eight cases (9.2%), trauma resulting in a cavernous pseudoaneurysm in seven cases (8.0%), and hemorrhage in three cases (3.4%). Therapeutic occlusion of the ICA across or just proximal to the aneurysm neck was performed in 68 patients (78.2%). Since 1984, with the development of a permanent solidifying agent (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) to fill the balloon, it is now feasible in some cases to guide the balloon directly into the aneurysm and preserve the parent artery; this was achieved in 19 cases (22%). Follow-up examination has demonstrated complete thrombosis with partial or total alleviation of symptoms in all patients with therapeutic occlusion of the parent vessel. Of the 19 patients with preservation of the parent artery, follow-up studies have demonstrated total exclusion in 12 cases (63%) and subtotal occlusion of greater than 85% in seven cases (37%), with clinical improvement in all cases. Complications from therapy included transient cerebral ischemia during or after therapy requiring volume expansion in seven cases, embolic symptoms requiring antiplatelet medication in two cases, and stroke in four cases; there were no deaths. Detachable balloon embolization therapy, particularly for large and giant symptomatic aneurysms of the cavernous ICA, can be an effective mode of treatment.\r"

This complication most often goes unrecognized by the patient as well as the physician, and attention should be drawn to it because of its widespread occurrence. This investigation demonstrates a high incidence of anosmia (24 (88.9%) of 27 surgical sides) occurring ipsilateral to the frontotemporal approach in aneurysm surgery. Recovery after traumatic anosmia has been recorded up to 5 years after injury. Nevertheless, the authors believe that the damage is permanent when lasting 35 months or longer.\r"

In this setting, surgical treatment has occasionally been performed, based on evidence that pertinent pain pathways and parasympathetic pathways may be interrupted at the main sensory root of the trigeminal nerve and at the nervus intermedius. Between 1976 and 1987, 13 patients underwent surgery for treatment of cluster headache that was refractory to medical therapy (15 procedures). Partial sectioning of the main sensory root and sectioning of the nervus intermedius were performed in nine patients; only partial sectioning of the main sensory root in one; only sectioning of the nervus intermedius in one; and nervus intermedius sectioning plus microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve in two. The average postoperative period for the 13 patients was 37 months (range 2 to 135 months). All patients had return of their headaches postoperatively except for one patient who obtained relief after a repeat procedure. Headache began to return between 2 days and 2 years postoperatively. Three patients are currently free of headache, including both patients who had nervus intermedius sectioning plus microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve. Together with recurrence of headache, cluster-associated autonomic disturbances recurred after 14 of the 15 operations but are currently absent in the three headache-free patients. Partial sectioning of the main sensory root and sectioning of the nervus intermedius, as performed in these patients, seem to have limited value in the treatment of cluster headache.\r"

Hyperprolactinemia was observed in three of 18 patients with GH-secreting adenoma. The tumor tissue was demonstrated to contain ir-PRL in nine patients and PRL mRNA in 13. The presence of ir-PRL in the tumor tissue was always associated with positive PRL mRNA, indicating production of PRL in GH-secreting tumors. Among the three patients with hyperprolactinemia, both ir-PRL and PRL mRNA was revealed in the tumor tissue of one, PRL mRNA but not ir-PRL was detected in the adenoma tissue of another, and neither PRL mRNA nor ir-PRL was found in the tumor tissue of the third. The association of hyperprolactinemia with the presence of both ir-PRL and PRL mRNA or PRL mRNA alone is indicative of PRL production and secretion. However, the absence of ir-PRL and PRL mRNA in the tumor tissue may indicate that hyperprolactinemia is caused by the suppression of PRL inhibitory factor due to hypothalamic dysfunction by the tumor mass. Thus, the study of PRL gene expression and immunohistochemistry in GH-secreting adenomas is valuable to understanding the pathophysiology of pituitary tumors.\r"

Of these 253 patients, 44 were found to have sacral fractures and form the basis of this study. The type of fracture, neurological deficit, treatment, and outcome in these patients were analyzed. The patient population consisted of 25 males and 19 females, with a mean age of 34 years (range 15 to 80 years). The fractures were classified by the degree of involvement of the foramina and central canal. Fractures through the ala sacralis only (Zone I, 25 cases) or involving the foramina but not the central canal (Zone II, seven cases) were less likely to cause nerve injury (24% and 29%, respectively). Fractures involving the central canal (Zone III), both vertical (five cases) and transverse (seven cases), were more likely to cause neurological injury (60% and 57%, respectively). Neurological deficits in Zone I and II injuries were usually unilateral lumbar and sacral radiculopathies. Zone III deficits were usually bilateral and severe; bowel and/or bladder incontinence was present in six of the 12 patients in this group. Deficits generally improved with time; however, operative reduction and internal fixation may have been useful, particularly in patients with unilateral root symptoms. The treatment options are discussed, and previously published series of sacral fractures are reviewed. The authors conclude that the classification of sacral fractures described is useful in predicting the incidence and severity of neurological deficit.\r"

Cerebral concussion has been well studied, both clinically and experimentally. In comparison, spinal cord concussion (SCC) is poorly understood. The clinical and radiological features of 19 SCC injuries in the general population are presented. Spinal cord injuries were classified as concussions if they met three criteria: 1) spinal trauma immediately preceded the onset of neurological deficits; 2) neurological deficits were consistent with spinal cord involvement at the level of injury; and 3) complete neurological recovery occurred within 72 hours after injury. Most cases involved young males, injured during athletics or due to falls. Concussion occurred at the two most unstable spinal regions, 16 involving the cervical spinal and three the thoracolumbar junction. Fifteen cases presented with combined sensorimotor deficits, while four exhibited only sensory disturbances. Many patients showed signs of recovery with the first few hours after injury and most had completely recovered within 24 hours. Only one case involved an unstable spinal injury. There was no evidence of ligamentous instability, spinal stenosis, or canal encroachment in the remaining 18 cases. Two patients, both children, suffered recurrent SCC injuries. No delayed deterioration or permanent cord injuries occurred. Spinal abnormalities that would predispose the spinal cord to a compressive injury were present in only one of the 19 cases. This suggests that, as opposed to direct cord compression, SCC may be the result of an indirect cord injury. Possible mechanisms are discussed.\r"

Blood-brain and blood-tumor permeability was determined by quantitative autoradiography using 14C aminoisobutyric acid. Leukotriene C4 (4 micrograms total dose) infused into the carotid artery ipsilateral to the tumor increased twofold the unidirectional transfer constant for permeability within the tumor while no effect on permeability was seen in normal brain. No gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) activity was seen in tumor capillaries in contrast to high gamma-GTP in normal brain capillaries. These findings suggest that normal brain capillaries may resist the vasogenic effects of LTC4, while LTC4 will increase permeability in tumor capillaries. This could relate to the ability of gamma-GTP to act as an enzymatic barrier and inactivate leukotrienes in normal brain capillaries. Intracarotid LTC4 infusion may be a useful tool to selectively open the blood-tumor barrier for delivery of antineoplastic compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Cisternal blood injection in the rat induces a biphasic angiographic vasospasm, with a maximal acute spasm at 10 minutes and a maximal late spasm at 2 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Depletion of substance P-containing sensory nerves to the cerebral arteries with capsaicin prior to SAH prevents the development of both acute and late spasm. Intrathecal administration of the substance P antagonist spantide 2 hours prior to SAH also prevents the development of vasospasm, while spantide administration 1 hour before SAH only hinders the occurrence of late vasospasm. Intracisternal administration of spantide 2 hours post-SAH prevents the development of late vasospasm. This antagonist per se can induce a short-lasting dose-dependent angiographic vasoconstriction. Substance P-containing nerve fibers on the cerebral arteries could constitute the sensory link in a reflex arc system involved in the development of vasospasm in which the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space stimulates sensory substance P-containing nerve fibers on the cerebral arteries inducing a centripetal impulse to the A2-nucleus tractus solitarius setting into motion the events in the brain stem leading to acute and late vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "Most available cerebrospinal fluid diversion systems utilize differential-pressure valves that often induce overshunting, resulting in complications due to the siphoning of fluid from the ventricular system when the patient is in the erect position. A new siphon-control device (SCD) was tested alone and in combination with four types of differential-pressure valves with low, medium, and high opening pressures (namely PS Medical, Heyer-Schulte, Cordis-Hakim, and Codman valves). The valve inlet and outlet pressures were measured at several fluid inflow rates between 2.0 and 50.0 ml/hr. Inlet pressure and valve resistance were determined when the outlet pressures of the differential-pressure valve or SCD were varied between 0 and -60 cm H2O. Of the differential-pressures valves tested, none provided protection against siphoning without the distal connection of the SCD. The SCD allowed all differential-pressure valves tested to maintain atmospheric pressure regardless of the outlet pressure. The SCD performs in a manner similar to the older anti-siphon device, but with some improvements in design and construction. The results of this investigation suggest that the increased resistance due to the inline SCD is not functionally significant when added to the conventional valve systems with low opening pressure.\r"

Drops in mean arterial blood pressure of 38% and in heart rate of 30% were observed during compression (p less than 0.0001). Corneal reflex, pinprick sensation, and mastication strength were intact in 13 of 14 rabbits after compression. These findings resembled the effects of percutaneous compression in humans and suggested that the New Zealand White rabbit is a useful model for the study of percutaneous compression. Trigeminal sensory roots and ganglia from 14 rabbits killed at intervals from 1 to 84 days after percutaneous compression were sectioned and stained using immunoperoxidase for neurofilaments, hematoxylin and eosin, luxol fast blue, and cresyl echt violet. Focal axonal damage and demyelination were present 7 days after compression. No difference could be detected in the perikaryonal distribution of neurofilaments between compressed and control trigeminal ganglia. Focal demyelination and Schwann cell proliferation preceding remyelination were present in the trigeminal sensory root at 84 days. Differential injury of axons compared to trigeminal ganglion cell bodies suggests that axonal regeneration is possible and may contribute to the recovery of motor and sensory function in patients after percutaneous compression.\r"

The tumors studied included 10 glioblastomas multiforme (GBM's), nine other glial tumors, and eight meningiomas. In normal brain, TfR was detected primarily in endothelial cells; rare glial cells also contained immunoreactive product. All tumors contained TfR-positive cells, although the intensity (number of cells stained) and pattern (focal vs. diffuse) of staining varied with the histopathological type of the tumor. Among gliomas, the most intense staining was seen in GBM's, especially in areas of pseudopalisading where virtually all cells were stained. A rough correlation between tumor grade, number of positively stained cells, and staining pattern was seen in the other astrocytic tumors. By contrast, all meningiomas demonstrated an identical and characteristic focal staining pattern. Considering the differential immunostaining for TfR between normal and neoplastic tissue, the authors conclude that TfR may be an appropriate target for monoclonal antibody-directed brain-tumor immunotherapy, especially in more malignant tumors such as GBM's.\r"

  ".W": "A model was developed to determine whether protein-based chemotherapeutic agents can cross the blood-brain barrier and successfully treat brain tumors. The human small-cell lung carcinoma N417D was grown as a solid tumor in the nude rat brain, and diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered intravenously as therapy. Because rat cells lack functional DT receptors and are 1000 to 10,000 times less sensitive to DT than human cells, a therapeutic window exists between the implanted human tumor and the nude rat host. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of DT were defined. Within 6 hours, more than 90% of the initial DT concentration was removed from the blood. The blood-to-tumor transfer constant Ki for DT in small N417D tumors was 0.49 microliters/gm-min, one-fourth to one-fifth the reported values for permeability to proteins in other experimental tumor models. Despite the toxin's short plasma half-life and the relatively intact blood-tumor barrier, DT administered intravenously as a single dose significantly extended animal survival. Untreated nude rats developed solid parenchymal tumors and died in 11 to 16 days (median 15 days). When administered at 0.1 micrograms/animal, DT increased the median survival time to 19 days (p less than 0.0016) while 1.0-microgram doses extended median survival times to 26.5 days (p less than 0.0002). A higher dose of DT (3.0 micrograms) had no further beneficial effect on survival (26.1 days). Blood-brain barrier constraints to successful monoclonal antibody-based therapies of brain tumors may have been overestimated since antibody conjugates have plasma half-lives longer than DT, and the permeability of N417D tumors to DT is equal to or less than the permeability of other experimental tumors to large proteins. Recently developed immunotoxins that have the higher potency of DT and a therapeutic window as wide as DT has in this nude rat/human tumor paradigm may be effective in treating brain tumors despite limited blood-tumor permeability.\r"

Although none of the patients showed signs of the severe dementing syndrome that has been described in persons with HIV infection, they demonstrated signs of cognitive impairment consistent with organic brain dysfunction. The profile of deficits shown by AIDS and ARC patients could be broadly grouped into disorders of recent and delayed memory and learning, generalized cognitive slowing, and reduced mental flexibility. Considerations of the clinical and neuropathological similarities between subcortical dementing syndromes and HIV-related cognitive impairment suggest that in both processes the pathogenesis of the observed deficits may involve disruption of frontodiencephalic projections.\r"

The patient population consisted of 52 men and 6 women. Their socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using the occupational prestige and level of education as indicators. As in the U.S.A., most patients (72%) were male homosexuals/bisexuals (HMS/BSX). However, nine patients (31%) at the HG could not be assigned to any of the currently known risk groups. Comparison of the SES of the two series revealed a significantly higher number of poor patients at HG (81 vs. 17%). For the whole group, the most frequent infections were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) (65%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (28%), Pneumocystis carinii (24%), and Toxoplasma gondii (17%). Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was found in 41% of the cases. The frequency of toxoplasmosis was higher in poor patients (30 vs. 8%, odds ratio of 5.5, 95% confidence limits of 0.83, 39.34, p = 0.04) while the reverse situation was true for KS (18 vs. 61%, odds ratio of 0.14, 95% confidence limits of 0.04, 0.55, p = 0.001). For KS, this difference persisted when only HMS/BSX patients were compared. In conclusion, dissimilarities observed in the frequency of some AIDS-associated diseases in different institutions appear to be mainly influenced by the SES of the patients.\r"

When given as single agents, both AZT and rHuIFN-alpha A/D suppressed virus-induced splenomegaly in a dose-dependent fashion in mice inoculated with Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV). However, suppressive doses of single-agent AZT caused anemia after 20 days of therapy. Combining rHuIFN-alpha A/D with AZT allowed drastic dose reductions for each agent while maintaining greater than or equal to 93% inhibition of splenomegaly. No clinically significant toxicity was seen. Computer analysis with the isobologram technique and combination index method showed that these combination regimens were highly synergistic. A 20-day course of AZT + rHuIFN-alpha A/D started 4 h after virus exposure was protective against RLV viremia and disease. After cessation of therapy, the animals were resistant to rechallenge with fully infectious RLV. We conclude that prompt initiation of effective combination therapy after retroviral exposure prevented viremia and disease and led to protective immunity.\r"

It is also shown that messenger RNA species accumulate in HIV-1 infection from which the 17 kDa protein can be made. These observations suggest that ribosomal frameshift events may result in the biosynthesis of viral regulatory as well as viral structural proteins.\r"

In order to further evaluate these immunoconjugates as potential therapeutic reagents for killing HIV-infected cells, H9 cells infected with five different isolates of HIV were used as target cells in vitro. All three HIV-specific immunoconjugates were toxic to H9 cells infected with each HIV isolate, but were virtually nontoxic to uninfected cells. Chloroquine markedly potentiated the specific toxicity of all three conjugates, particularly the anti-gp41-dgAs.

  ".W": "Sera from 353 cats with naturally occurring feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection were collected in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle between 1968 and 1988. These sera were retrospectively assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Fifty-one (14.4%) of the FeLV-positive sera had antibodies to FIV, indicating dual oncovirus and lentivirus infections. FIV infections were confirmed by Western blot analysis, antibodies against the 15 and 27 kDa proteins being used as definitive markers. FIV infection was diagnosed in one cat sampled in 1968 and in eight other cats sampled before 1975 in New York City. Illnesses exhibited by coinfected cats were similar to those of cats infected with FeLV only. Two unrelated cats with multicentric fibrosarcomas were found to be simultaneously infected with FIV, FeLV, and feline sarcoma virus. FIV was less contagious than FeLV in 73 cats residing in an exposure household between 1977 and 1980 as determined by evaluation of sera collected sequentially. In this household, 15 resident cats became FeLV infected whereas no cats contracted FIV infection. Comparison of serologic results from 53 cats with leukemia/lymphoma and matched controls confirmed a strong correlation between FeLV viremia and leukemia/lymphoma. A significant correlation between FIV infection and lymphoproliferative malignancies was also found independent of FeLV infection.\r"

The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of YM-617 on sympathetic nerve activity and baroreceptor afferent nerve activity in anesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of YM-617 (2, 10 and 50 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction in mean arterial pressure accompanied with bradycardia. YM-617 caused dose-dependent decreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity along with this hypotension. Cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, preganglionic adrenal nerve activity as well as aortic depressor nerve activity was decreased by YM-617. When an equihypotensive dose of YM-617 and a centrally acting antihypertensive drug, clonidine, were compared, the sympathoinhibitory potency of YM-617 was less than that of clonidine. These findings suggest that YM-617 might possess a central sympathoinhibitory action which could play a role in its antitachycardic or bradycardic effect and could be partially responsible for its hypotensive action.\r"

The responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were determined in the isolated perfused mesenteric vascular bed preparation before and after infusion of epinephrine (at 0.27 or 2.7 microM); at the conclusion of the experiment the content of epinephrine in the mesenteric artery was determined. The intraluminal infusion of epinephrine at both high and low concentrations potentiated the responses of the preparation to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Mesenteric artery concentrations of this catecholamine were unchanged at the lower concentration (0.27 microM), but were increased after perfusion of epinephrine at the higher concentration (2.7 microM). The beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.5 microM) did not prevent the epinephrine-associated potentiation of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, nor did it influence the pressor effects of exogenous norepinephrine. The results suggest that beta adrenoceptors do not play a role in the epinephrine-induced potentiation of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the rat mesenteric vascular bed preparation. This potentiation may, however, be related to a desensitization of presynaptic inhibitory alpha adrenoceptors.\r"

A clearance method and a pyrazinamide suppression test were used to examine the mechanism of urate excretion in the kidney and the mode of action of uricosurics, respectively. The negative correlation between the urinary urate excretion and the endogenous plasma urate level was observed, suggesting the net reabsorption of urate may vary between strains. DBA/2N mice showed the lowest fractional excretion of urate (0.278), and the effects of uricosurics on DBA/2N mice are analogous to those of humans. Our extensive study of the mechanism of urate excretion in DBA/2N mice has proven that the mouse strain is a useful model for the study of uricosurics. AA-193 (5-chloro-7,8-dihydro-3-phenylfuro[2,3-g]-1,2-benzisoxazole-7-carb oxylic acid) is a potent new uricosuric agent developed in our laboratory. In the present study, AA-193 was tested in DBA/2N mice and found to have a mode of action different from well-known uricosuric agents. It appeared to inhibit presecretory reabsorption in the proximal tubules.\r"

  ".U": "90250612\r", 
  ".W": "Isolated nonperfused rabbit renal proximal tubules were used to investigate the basolateral step of transport of the organic cation N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN). NMN accumulation was highest and saturable in S2 and S3 segments, but lowest and nonsaturable in S1 segments. In S1 segments, accumulation of [3H]-NMN (0.5-8 microM in the bath) resulted in an average tubular water/medium concentration ratio (T/M) of 8.2, whereas in S2 and S3 segments T/M averaged 19.5 and 18.6, respectively. At these concentrations, about 30% of the label was attached in all segments to a metabolite comigrating with nicotinamide. KCN (10(-2) M) or ouabain (10(-4) M) reduced T/M to about 8 for all segments. NMN accumulation was inhibited (to a T/M of about 3 with mepiperphenidol) by other organic cations (10(-5)-10(-3) M) with the potency sequence mepiperphenidol greater than tetraethylammonium = quinine greater than morphine, these organic cations having no effect on p-aminohippurate accumulation, except for the highest concentration of quinine (10(-3) M). After correction for metabolism, NMN accumulation could be accounted for by simple electrochemical equilibrium across the basolateral membrane. The basolateral step of NMN transport appears therefore to be a carrier-mediated diffusion, in opposition to the active basolateral accumulation described for tetraethylammonium.\r"

NMN underwent a small reabsorptive transport which appeared to be passive. NMN secretory transport was saturable, inhibited by mepiperphenidol (10(-4) M) and presented a relatively low apparent affinity (apparent Km of 852 microM) for the organic cation transport system, with transport against a concentration gradient being observed only at low flow rates. Acidification of the perfusate, by either buffering it at pH 6.8 with MES, or by bubbling the bath with a mixture of 80% O2-20% CO2, resulted in a decrease, rather than an increase, of NMN secretion. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition with ethoxyzolamide (10(-4) M in the bath) did not modify NMN secretion. Addition of 20 to 40 microM NMN in the perfusate also did not change NMN secretion. Proton or organic cation counterexchange seemed therefore not to play a major role in NMN apical step of secretion, the basolateral step appearing to be the general organic cation system of transport for which NMN shows a low affinity.\r"

Scatchard plots and nonlinear regression analysis of specific [3H]TA-3090 binding best fit a one-site binding model (Kd = 8.8 +/- 2.7 nM, Bmax = 132 +/- 38 fmol/mg protein). Kinetically derived affinity constants were in close agreement (Kd = 7.86 nM) with those obtained from analysis of equilibrium binding data. In comparison, under identical conditions [3H]diltiazem exhibited a Kd of 38 nM and Bmax, 106 fmol/mg protein. Specific binding was saturable, reversible and stereoselective (d-cis-TA-3090 Ki = 14 nM; 1-cis-TA-3090 Ki = 2700 nM). Competitions for [3H]TA-3090 binding were conducted with nifedipine, propranolol, prazosin, quinuclidinyl benzilate, verapamil and yohimbine. Only the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil inhibited specific [3H]TA-3090 binding. Nifedipine could maximally inhibit only 52% of specifically bound [3H]TA-3090 at 10 microM. In contrast, however, 10 microM verapamil completely inhibited specific radioligand binding (Ki = 93 +/- 28 nM) but with six times less efficacy than TA-3090. Thus, these data demonstrate that [3H]TA-3090 is a potent radioligand selective for the benzothiazepine binding site and is consistent with the hypothesis that [3H]TA-3090 interacts with a myocardial benzothiazepine receptor site.\r"

The present study compared the psychomotor stimulant, discriminative stimulus, reinforcing and lethal effects of these analogs in rats and squirrel monkeys. NNDMA was 6 to 12 times less potent than MA in decreasing rates of responding in rats or monkeys under fixed interval or fixed ratio schedules of food presentation. Both MA and NNDMA produced dose-dependent increases in the percentage of cocaine-lever responses in rats trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg of cocaine from saline, with NNDMA 12 times less potent than MA. Response-produced i.v. infusions of MA or NNDMA maintained rates of responding that were higher than those maintained by saline infusions in squirrel monkeys trained to self-administer cocaine; NNDMA was 10 times less potent than MA in producing these reinforcing effects. Both drugs increased fixed interval responding in squirrel monkeys; MA was more efficacious than NNDMA. MA also increased rates of responding in rats during time-out periods in which responses had no scheduled consequences, whereas NNDMA did not. Onset and time course data suggested that conversion of NNDMA to MA was probably not necessary for the behavioral effects of NNDMA. In contrast to the relative potencies in behavioral tests, NNDMA was only 3 times less potent than MA in its lethal effects in rats. However, lethality of both drugs was prevented by haloperidol. In general, MA displayed a wider separation in the doses required to produce behavioral vs. lethal effects than did NNDMA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacologic specificity of the sensitization to naltrexone induced by acute opioid pretreatment was studied in rats trained to lever-press on a multiple-trial, fixed-interval 3-min schedule of food reinforcement. Cumulative doses of naltrexone were given until responding was suppressed; control naltrexone ED50 values for decreasing response rates ranged from 5.0 to 22 mg/kg. Agonists were administered 4 hr before naltrexone challenge. Pretreatment with morphine (10 mg/kg) initially produced a 4-fold shift to the left of the naltrexone dose-effect curve, but after repeated weekly testing with various agonists, produced a 1700-fold shift. Pretreatment with other millimicrons agonists (i.e., 0.3 mg/kg of levorphanol, 0.06 mg/kg of fentanyl and 3.0 mg/kg of methadone) produced similarly large (100- to 250-fold) increases in sensitivity to the rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone. On the other hand, pretreatment with agonists selective for kappa (1.0 mg/kg of ethylketocyclazocine and 3.0 mg/kg of U-50,488) or sigma (10 mg/kg of [+]-N-allylnormetazocine) receptors, produced smaller (10-fold) changes in sensitization to naltrexone. Neither dextrorphan (3.0 mg/kg) nor pentobarbital (18 mg/kg) pretreatment altered sensitivity to naltrexone. Thus, the sensitization to naltrexone induced by acute opioid pretreatment was a stereoselective, opioid-specific effect, and appeared to be mediated primarily by a mu-opioid mechanism. With repeated testing, the effect of acute morphine pretreatment was comparable to that reported after chronic administration, thus supporting the hypothesis that this phenomenon reflects receptor-mediated changes that underlie the state of opioid physical dependence.\r"

This study tests the hypothesis that angiotensin II augments adrenergic neurotransmission by depressing the neuronal release of ATP, resulting in suppressed formation of the inhibitory neuromodulator, adenosine or a related purine. Exogenous ATP added to the vasa deferentia increased adenosine formation and depressed adrenergic neurotransmission thus providing indirect support for the hypothesis. The adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-(sulfophenyl)theophylline (10 and 100 microM) depressed responses to exogenous adenosine and ATP but did not alter contractile responses to nerve stimulation or exogenously administered norepinephrine thus indicating that endogenous adenosine had no basal influence upon neurotransmission. However, the 8-(sulfophenyl)theophylline reduced angiotensin II effects on both adrenergic neurogenic contractions and evoked norepinephrine release. Additionally, the augmentation of adrenergic neurogenic contractions by angiotensin II was enhanced in the presence of ATP. These results are consistent with an ATP involvement in angiotensin effects on adrenergic neurotransmission and contrary to the initial hypothesis, suggest that purines enhance adrenergic neurotransmission in the presence of angiotensin II.\r"

The effect of TPA on the vasoconstrictor response to RNS or to increase basal vascular tone was not altered by PKC inhibitors. These data suggest that in the rat kidney, PKC is either resistant to the actions of H-7, PMB, SPH, SNG and ST, or PDBu and TPA produce renal vasoconstriction and facilitate adrenergic transmission by a mechanism unrelated to PKC activation.\r"

  ".U": "90250620\r", 
  ".W": "Our laboratory has demonstrated previously that prostaglandins are partially responsible for the vasodilation of rat cremaster muscle arterioles in vivo to a brief occlusion or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the present study, in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, we investigated the mechanism of the prostaglandin-independent portion of the dilation to these stimuli by measurement of changes in the diameter of third order cremasteric arterioles (approximately 15 microns) by video microscopy. In the presence of indomethacin suffusion (10 micrograms/ml), arteriolar dilation to the release of a 15-sec occlusion of a single arteriole or to topical application of 0.1 to 1 mM H2O2 (100 microliters) was reduced significantly by suffusion of 20 microM quinacrine or 5 microM methylene blue, whereas vasodilation to adenosine was not affected by these probes. Furthermore, the reactive hyperemia was not altered by suffusion of 50 microM hydroquinone or 0.2 mM NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, inhibitors of the dilation to acetylcholine mediated by the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Reactive hyperemia was also not affected by 30 microM theophylline (an adenosine antagonist) or suffusion of catalase (160 U/ml) plus superoxide dismutase (240 U/ml). Therefore, the reactive hyperemia does not appear to be mediated through endothelium-derived relaxing factor, adenosine or the extracellular formation of reactive O2 species. However, these observations suggest that the prostaglandin-independent vasodilation to H2O2 and to the release of a brief arteriolar occlusion may be mediated by a common mechanism, possibly involving cyclic GMP. Similarities in pharmacological modulation of the dilation after occlusion and to H2O2 in the cremaster microcirculation suggest consideration of the involvement of H2O2 in the hyperemic response.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated human, Japanese monkey and dog epicardial coronary arteries and dog renal and mesenteric arteries treated with phentolamine responded to isoproterenol with a concentration-related relaxation. The KB values of metoprolol, a beta-1 antagonist, in the coronary arteries from different mammals did not differ, but were appreciably smaller than those in the dog renal and mesenteric arteries. Treatment with butoxamine, a beta-2 antagonist, inhibited the relaxation of dog mesenteric arteries to a greater extent than that of monkey and dog coronary arteries. Terbutaline, a beta-2 agonist, produced a greater relaxation in monkey mesenteric and dog renal and mesenteric arteries than in human, monkey and dog coronary arteries. Norepinephrine relaxed the monkey and dog coronary arteries dose-dependently via mainly beta-1 adrenoceptors, but elicited a contraction or a minute relaxation in dog mesenteric arteries even when treated with high concentrations of phentolamine. Contractile responses to electrical stimulation of adrenergic nerves in monkey coronary arteries were potentiated by treatment with metoprolol and propranolol, whereas the contractions in dog mesenteric arteries were unaffected. It is concluded that the amine-induced relaxation of human and monkey epicardial coronary arteries is mediated mainly by beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype, as is the response of dog coronary arteries. Involvement of beta-1 subtype in coronary artery relaxations would be a mechanism underlying potentiation by beta antagonists of the contraction caused by norepinephrine released from adrenergic nerves in primates.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of a new potent thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist as a protective measure in circulatory shock induced by splanchnic artery occlusion and reperfusion. The celiac and superior mesenteric arteries of anesthetized rats were occluded for 40 min followed by reperfusion, resulting in a large decrease in mean arterial blood pressure usually leading to a fatal outcome within 60 to 90 min. Rats were treated with the specific thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, (+)-S145Na, at one of three doses (50, 200 or 500 micrograms/kg) or with its vehicle (0.9% NaCl). In isolated rat aortic rings, (+)-S145Na was found to be a highly specific and potent thromboxane receptor antagonist having an IC50 of 1 ng/ml. The highest dose of the drug exhibited protection characterized by an attenuation in the increases in hematocrit (P less than .05), plasma cathepsin D activity (P less than .05), plasma aminonitrogen concentration (P less than .05), and plasma myocardial depressant factor activity (P less than .01) as well as increased survival rate and time (P less than .01), compared to the splanchnic artery occlusion shock group given the vehicle. The lowest dose of (+)-S145Na failed to provide protection, whereas the intermediate dose (i.e., 200 micrograms/kg) exerted less dramatic protective effects than the 500 micrograms/kg dose. These findings suggest an important role of thromboxane A2 in the pathogenesis of splanchnic artery occlusion shock, and that (+)-S145Na may be a useful agent in the treatment of bowel ischemia and its complications.\r"

  ".W": "Derivatives of amiloride that exhibit greater specificity for inhibition of either Na+/H+ or Na+/Ca(+)+ exchange were evaluated for their ability to influence phenylephrine (PE)-induced contractions of the rabbit aorta. Most, but not all, derivatives with alkyl substituents at the 5-amino position (which exhibit greater potency for Na+/H+ exchange inhibition) caused a dose-dependent contraction at concentrations above 10 microM. At higher concentrations and longer incubation times this contraction reached 70 to 80% of the maximal PE response. Contractions induced by 5-amino-substituted amiloride derivatives were dependent upon extracellular Ca(+)+ and were inhibited by either extracellular acidification or intracellular alkalinization. This suggests that they resulted from an influence of intracellular acidification on Ca(+)+ transport. Contractile responses to PE (1 microM) were reduced by most but not all 5-amino-substituted derivatives in conjunction with tension development. Dimethylamiloride, however, failed to cause a contraction at doses up to 100 microM but was the most potent inhibitor of PE-induced contractions among the 5-amino derivatives. Dose-response curves for PE were shifted both to the right and downward by increasing concentrations of amiloride, which indicates both competitive and noncompetitive types of inhibition. Guanidino-substituted derivatives such as benzobenzamil were the most potent antagonists, producing noncompetitive inhibition in excess of 90% at a concentration of 10 microM. The differing patterns of inhibition as well as the presence or absence of intrinsic contractile activity indicate that amiloride derivatives have the potential for multiple pathways of action that modify arterial contractility.\r"

  ".W": "The biliary excretion mechanism of cefpiramide, a typical biliary excretion type cephalosporin antibiotic, was investigated by measuring the uptake by purified rat liver bile canalicular membrane vesicles. The initial uptake of cefpiramide showed significant temperature and concentration dependencies; the kinetic parameters were estimated to be 1.73 mM, 2.64 nmol/40 sec/mg protein and 0.17 nmol/40 sec/mg protein/mM for Michaelis constant, maximum uptake rate and nonsaturable uptake rate constant, respectively. An intravesicular positive membrane potential induced by valinomycin significantly enhanced the initial uptake of cefpiramide. Furthermore, by inducing an inside negative membrane potential, the initial efflux was significantly enhanced. Organic anions such as bile acids, bromosulfophthalein, bilirubin, probenecid, furosemide and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilben-2,2'-disulfonic acid significantly reduced the uptake of cefpiramide, whereas amino acids, dipeptides, organic neutral compounds and cationic compounds had no effect. The inhibitory effects of taurocholic acid and bromosulfopthalein were especially competitive. Most of the beta-lactam antibiotics tested significantly reduced the uptake of cefpiramide in a competitive manner. Furthermore, benzylpenicillin showed a countertransport effect on the cefpiramide uptake. From these results it is suggested that neither organic cation nor dipeptide carrier systems participate in the uptake of beta-lactam antibiotics, and most of the derivatives are transported by recognition as organic anions in the bile canalicular membrane.\r"

Slices taken from the ventral (temporal) and dorsal (septal) regions of rat hippocampi were perfused in artificial cerebrospinal fluid bubbled continuously with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 34 degrees C. A stimulating electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum of CA3 region and electrical activity was recorded from the pyramidal cell body layer of the CA3b region. Paired dorsal and ventral hippocampal slices were perfused with [N-Me-Phe3-D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017), a specific mu opioid receptor agonist. Application of 0.05 microM PL017 produced triggered and spontaneous bursting in 20% of ventral hippocampal slices, but no such effect was observed in dorsal hippocampal slices. At 0.5 microM PL017, 80% of ventral hippocampal slices developed spontaneous bursting, whereas only 10% of dorsal hippocampal slices had spontaneous bursting. Slices from the ventral hippocampus consistently produced greater degrees of bursting at lower doses relative to the dorsal hippocampus. The addition of 0.1 microM naloxone before or after PL017 inhibited the triggered response but could not block the spontaneous bursting. Perfusion of ACSF for 1 hr also eliminated the triggered response but could only reduce the frequency of the spontaneous bursting. These results suggest that the ventral hippocampus has a higher susceptibility to PL017-induced epileptiform bursting, and this effect is mediated, at least in part, through mu opioid receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Effect of ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) on the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ion channel complex was studied. Beta-CCE noncompetitively and competitively inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptor, but not [3H]muscimol binding to GABAA receptor as well as t-[3H]butylbicycloorthobenzoate [( 3H] TBOB) binding to chloride ion channel, in particulate fraction of the mouse brain. Ro15-1788 also inhibited competitively [3H] flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, the binding of beta-[3H]CCE was inhibited noncompetitively and competitively by clonazepam and competitively by Ro15-1788. In agreement with these results, benzodiazepines-stimulated [3H]muscimol binding was antagonized by beta-CCE and Ro15-1788. Gel column chromatography for the solubilized fraction from cerebral particulate fraction by 0.2% sodium deoxycholate (DOC-Na) in the presence of 1 M KCl indicated that beta-[3H]CCE binding site was eluted in the same fraction (molecular weight, 250,000) as the binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]muscimol and [3H]TBOB. GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles prepared from the bovine cerebral cortex was stimulated and attenuated by flunitrazepam and beta-CCE, respectively. These effects of flunitrazepam and beta-CCE on the GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx were antagonized by Ro15-1788. The present results suggest that the binding site for beta-CCE, which resides on GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ion channel complex, may be different from that for benzodiazepine. Possible roles of beta-CCE binding site in the allosteric inhibitions on benzodiazepine binding site as well as on the functional coupling between chloride ion channel and GABAA receptor are also suggested.\r"

In the rat, pulegone extensively depleted glutathione measured in both liver tissue and plasma, and its toxicity was markedly enhanced in animals treated with buthionine sulfoximine. The glutathione-depleting effect of pulegone was compromised following inhibition of cytochrome P-450 by piperonyl butoxide. In addition, we found no evidence for conjugation of glutathione to unchanged pulegone in vitro. Administration of menthofuran, a known oxidative and hepatotoxic metabolite of pulegone, only marginally affected glutathione levels in plasma and liver, and toxicity was not augmented by buthionine sulfoximine. These results provide indirect evidence for cytochrome P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of pulegone via at least two independent pathways: 1) the formation and subsequent activation of menthofuran from pulegone; and 2) the formation of reactive intermediate(s) from pulegone, but not menthofuran, which can be detoxified through a mechanism requiring reduced glutathione.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrolysis of phosphoinositides elicited by stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors has been studied in brain from neonatal (7-day-old) rats in order to determine: 1) whether the neonatal rat could provide a good model system to study this signal-transduction pathway; and 2) whether potential differences with adult nerve tissue would explain the differential, age-related effects of cholinergic agonists. Accumulation of [3H] inositol phosphates in [3H]inositol prelabeled slices from neonatal and adult rats was measured as an index of phosphoinositide metabolism. Full (acetylcholine, methacholine, carbachol) and partial (oxotremorine, bethanechol) agonists had qualitatively similar, albeit quantitatively different, effects in neonatal and adult rats. Atropine and pirenzepine effectively blocked the carbachol-induced response with inhibition constants of 1.2 and 20.7 nM, respectively. In all brain areas, response to all agonists was higher in neonatal than adult rats, and in hippocampus and cerebral cortex the response was higher than in cerebellum or brainstem. The relative intrinsic activity of partial agonists was higher in the latter two areas (0.6-0.7) than in the former two (0.3-0.4). Carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in brain areas correlated well with the binding of [3H]QNB (r2 = 0.627) and, particularly, with [3H]pirenzepine (r2 = 0.911). In cerebral cortex the effect of carbachol was additive to that of norepinephrine and glutamate. The presence of calcium (250-500 microM) was necessary for maximal response to carbachol to be elicited; the EC50 value for Ca2+ was 65.4 microM. Addition of EDTA completely abolished the response. Removal of sodium ions from the incubation medium reduced the response to carbachol by 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nifedipine inhibited the Ca2+ channel currents (Ba2+ current) dose-dependently. Inhibition by nifedipine was greater at higher (more positive) holding potentials and higher command potentials. According to the modulated receptor hypothesis, Kd values for resting state and inactivated state of channel were calculated to be 150-300 and 1.2-6.8 nM, respectively (at a command potential of -20 mV). Mg2+ applied in the bath dose-dependently inhibited the Ca2+ current recorded with 2 mM Ca2+ (Ki = 12 mM, at a command potential of -10 mV). Inhibition by Mg2+ was weaker at the higher command potentials. Voltage dependency observed for the Mg2+ block may be due to a shift of the activation curve (Mg2+ neutralizes the outer surface charge) and/or due to the location of the binding site for Mg2+ in the Ca2+ channel electric field. In contrast, high dose of isoproterenol (10 microM) did not produce significant change in the Ca2+ current. In summary, nifedipine and Mg2+ inhibited the Ca2+ channel, with opposite voltage dependencies, whereas isoproterenol had no effect on the Ca2+ current. Thus, beta-agonist may relax the uterine muscle by mechanisms other than inhibition of the Ca2+ channels.\r"

We monitored airway opening pressure as an index of airway caliber, and the provocative dose of bradykinin required to produce 100% increase in airway opening pressure (PD100) was determined. Animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) to inhibit adrenergic bronchodilatation. After i.v. administration, the bronchoconstrictor dose-response curve to bradykinin (PD100 = 0.93 nmol/kg) was shifted significantly to the right by atropine (PD100 = 2.34 nmol/kg, P less than .05) and indomethacin (PD100 = 61.7 nmol/kg, P less than .05). Depletion of tachykinins by capsaicin pretreatment had no significant effect on the response to i.v. bradykinin. After tracheal instillation, the bronchoconstrictor dose-response curve to bradykinin (PD100 = 24.5 nmol) was shifted to the right by atropine (PD100 greater than 150 nmol, P less than .05) and capsaicin pretreatment (PD100 greater than 150 nmol, P less than .05). After atropine the response to instilled bradykinin was almost abolished in capsaicin-pretreated animals. Indomethacin had no effect on the bronchoconstrictor response to instilled bradykinin. We conclude that i.v. bradykinin causes bronchoconstriction predominantly by the release of cyclooxygenase products but that a cholinergic reflex is also involved, whereas sensory neuropeptides are not important. By contrast the bronchoconstrictor response to instilled bradykinin is mediated by neural mechanisms involving both cholinergic nerves and sensory neuropeptides but not by cyclooxygenase products.\r"

In contrast, dynorphin A(1-17) and [N-methyl-Tyr1,N-methyl-Arg7,D-Leu8]-dynorphin A(1-8) ethylamide (E 2078), a degrading-enzyme-resistant derivative of dynorphin, significantly potentiated both behavioral changes. The dynorphin- and E 2078-induced potentiations were inhibited by Mr 2266. [D-Ala2,Met5]-enkephalinamide-induced attenuation of environment-induced conditioned suppression of motility and forced swimming-induced immobility was prevented by treatment with dynorphin and E 2078 at the doses that did not affect the behavioral changes. This antagonism by both dynorphin and E 2078 was inhibited by Mr 2266. However, [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]-enkephalin-induced attenuation of both behavioral changes was not affected by either dynorphin or E 2078. These results indicated that activation of the methionine- or leucine-enkephalinergic system attenuates behavioral changes induced by stress, whereas activation of the dynorphinergic system potentiates those changes.

Four antagonists were selected, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, dicyclomine, methoctramine and hexahydrosiladifenidol, to complement previous studies using pirenzepine and 11,2- ([2-(diethylaminomethyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one, in order to distinguish M1, M2 and M3 receptors. All the antagonists produced competitive inhibition of responses to methacholine, with Schild plot slopes not different from one, with one exception: for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, Schild plot slopes were greater than one in both tissues. Comparison of antagonist affinities suggests that the muscarinic receptor subtype is not different between the two tissues, despite the different cell types that mediate these responses. Furthermore, the pattern of antagonist affinity agrees most closely with that found previously for the M3 receptor, with high affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, hexahydrosiladifenidol and dicyclomine, intermediate affinity for pirenzepine, and low affinity for 11,2- ([2-(diethylaminomethyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one and methoctramine.

Rat heart tissue was perfused retrogradely with Krebs-Henseleit medium containing 2.5 mM calcium and 10 mM glucose. The infusion of 0.1, 1.0 or 1.24, but not 0.01 microM, ruthenium red throughout 60 min of hypoxia and 30 min of reoxygenation decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, the release of lactate dehydrogenase normally seen at reoxygenation. When the infusion of 1.24 microM ruthenium red was begun after 45 min of hypoxia, lactate dehydrogenase release at reoxygenation after 60 min of hypoxia was decreased, but to a lesser extent than when this agent was present throughout hypoxia. Ruthenium red, 1.24 microM, had no significant effects on coronary flow or function in oxygenated heart tissue. When present throughout hypoxia and reoxygenation, 1.24 microM ruthenium red prevented the decrease in coronary flow normally seen and allowed recovery of heart rate, +dP/dT, -dP/dT and work (defined as the product of developed pressure and heart rate) to normal levels. Significant functional protection was not evident at reoxygenation when ruthenium red was infused after 45 min of hypoxia or in the absence of glucose. Cardiac ATP, creatine phosphate and energy charge were decreased after 60 min of hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of i.v. morphine on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in the rat. Adrenal SNA and renal SNA were recorded simultaneously, together with mean arterial pressure and heart rate, in chloralose-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. Separate groups of rats were subjected to vagotomy. In intact rats, i.v. injection of morphine (1 mg/kg) caused an immediate transient depressor response. Within 1-3 sec, renal SNA was markedly inhibited in parallel with hypotension and bradycardia. After a few minutes, mean arterial pressure and renal SNA returned toward base-line levels, and subsequently they declined gradually again below base line. Adrenal SNA, however, showed an immediate brief increase. In the vagotomized rats, an extended renal SNA excitation occurred, accompanied by a rise in mean arterial pressure. After about 15 min, these variables returned toward base-line levels. The adrenal SNA excitation still occurred in the vagotomized rats. The renal depressor and the renal and adrenal pressor responses were all abolished by naloxone pretreatment. It is concluded that i.v. injection of morphine induces a highly differentiated response of SNA. A pronounced immediate increase in adrenal SNA occurs in parallel with renal SNA inhibition. The renal nerve inhibition is mainly reflexly obtained by opioid receptor-mediated activation of vagal afferents. The predominant central action of morphine seems to be sympathetic excitation which is also mediated through opioid receptors.\r"

Saturation experiments performed with [3H]prazosin, [3H]yohimbine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate in rabbit bladder base, bladder dome and urethra indicate the presence of regional, sex- and age-related differences in the density of alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor density is considerably higher in the female than in the male urethra of both age groups, whereas the higher density of beta adrenergic receptors in the female than in the male bladder base is observed only in the younger animals. The density of muscarinic receptors is higher in bladder dome than in bladder base or urethra in young rabbits of both sexes. In the old animals, the density of muscarinic receptors in bladder base increases to the level observed in bladder dome. Inhibition experiments with selective adrenergic agonists and antagonists indicate that the pharmacological profiles of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the urethra and beta adrenergic receptors in the bladder dome and bladder base are similar in both sexes and at both ages. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are shown to be predominant in bladder base and bladder dome of rabbits. Parallel studies in rabbit urethra, adult rat cortex and neonatal rat lung show that the urethral alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are of the alpha-2A subtype.\r"

  ".U": "90250644\r", 
  ".W": "In isolated dog coronary arteries, serotonin (5-HT) produced a contraction, whereas 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), a serotonergic 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, mainly relaxed the arteries, and the contraction, if any, was slight. Human and Japanese monkey coronary artery strips responded to these amines only with contractions, the magnitude being markedly greater than that of serotonin-induced contractions in the dog arteries. Removal of endothelium slightly potentiated the serotonin-induced contraction and abolished the relaxation by 5-CT or reversed it to a contraction in the dog arteries; however, contractions elicited by serotonin and 5-CT in the human and monkey arteries were not influenced. Treatment with 10(-7) M 5-CT suppressed the contraction by serotonin in the dog arteries but did not alter the response of the monkey arteries. Relaxation of the dog arteries with endothelium caused by 5-CT and contraction of the arteries denuded of endothelium were not inhibited by ketanserin but they were by methysergide. 5-CT-induced contractions of human and monkey coronary arteries were attenuated by ketanserin and methysergide, although the inhibition was less with the 5-HT2 antagonist. Ketanserin inhibited the contraction by serotonin to a greater extent than the 5-CT-induced contraction in the monkey arteries. It may be concluded that 5-CT stimulates 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in smooth muscle of human and monkey epicardial coronary arteries but acts exclusively on 5-HT1-like receptors in endothelium and smooth muscle of dog coronary arteries. Serotonin contracts the primate arteries, possibly by predominant activation of 5-HT2 over 5-HT1-like receptors.\r"

Longitudinal strips were cut along the oral-caudal axis of the intestine while circular strips were cut 90 degrees to that axis. The strips were stretched to their optimum lengths and subjected to electrical field stimulation (0.1-1.0 msec pulse duration, 30-270 mA, 1-26 Hz) in the presence of Krebs' solution and Krebs' solution plus 10(-6) M atropine. Field stimulation produced atropine-sensitive and atropine-resistant contractions in these tissues. Significant differences among the three groups were found in the amplitudes of atropine-sensitive contractions in strips from proximal longitudinal muscle. The 6-month-old animals showed the highest amplitude contractions and the 4-month-old the lowest, whereas the 5-month-old animals showed contractions that were intermediate in amplitude. No significant differences were noted among the atropine-resistant contractions. Field stimulation delivered at pulse durations of 5.0 and 50.0 msec in the presence of neural blockade with tetrodotoxin (5 X 10(-6) M) produced similar contraction amplitudes among the three groups. These results show that tension development produced by field stimulation of the proximal intestine increases significantly with age. The increases appear to be due to age-related differences in cholinergic neuromuscular transmission.\r"

U-73122 caused a time- and concentration-dependent (0.1-1 microM) inhibition of myeloperoxidase and vitamin B12-binding protein release from PMNs exposed to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, recombinant human C5a, leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor. Activation of the respiratory burst, as measured by superoxide anion production, in PMNs stimulated with these agonists was also suppressed by U-73122. These data suggested that U-73122 inhibited a component of signal transduction that was common to the mechanisms of action of these stimuli. Production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol and the rise in the cytosolic free calcium concentration, which are early postreceptor events in PMN activation, were all suppressed in U-73122-treated PMNs stimulated with the agonists. These signal transduction events require activation of PLC. Receptor-coupled activation of PLC in membranes isolated from PMNs was potently inhibited by U-73122. U-73122, however, had no direct effect on PMN protein kinase C activity. 1-[6-[[17 beta-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl] -2,5- pyrrolidine-dione (U-73343), a close analog of U-73122 that does not suppress PLC activity, did not inhibit receptor-specific agonist-induced PMN responsiveness. U-73122, therefore, is a novel reagent that is useful in investigating PLC function in receptor-mediated PMN activation.\r"

That these antinociceptive effects were antagonized by alpha adrenoceptor antagonists suggests that spinal adrenoceptors modulate the rostrad transmission of nociceptive information. The role of spinal adrenoceptors in the modulation of nociception in visceral pain tests has in the past been examined primarily in the writhing model of visceral pain. Recently, however, a new model of visceral pain has been developed which utilizes colorectal distension (CRD) as the noxious visceral stimulus in awake, unanesthetized animals. CRD produces a pressor response and contraction of the abdominal and hindlimb musculature (a visceromotor response), both of which are readily quantifiable. Inhibition of both of these pseudoaffective reflexes is indicative of antinociception. The effects of intrathecally administered adrenoceptor agonists on the responses to CRD were examined in conscious rats. The visceromotor and pressor responses to CRD were dose-dependently inhibited by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and ST-91 and the nonselective alpha adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine (NE), but not by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine or the alpha adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. Tizanidine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, dose-dependently inhibited the pressor response to CRD but failed to significantly elevate the visceromotor threshold in response to CRD. The effects produced by clonidine, NE and ST-91 were antagonized by pretreatment with yohimbine. The effects produced by tizanidine were antagonized by idazoxan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-dependent uptake of 36Cl- by mouse cortical microsacs was used to study the actions of benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists and inverse agonists. Chronic exposure to ethanol attenuated the ability of a BZ agonist, flunitrazepam, to augment muscimol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- and enhanced the actions of BZ inverse agonists, Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,4]-benzodiazepine - 3-carboxylate) and DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), to inhibit GABAA receptor-operated chloride channels. Augmentation of chloride flux by pentobarbital was not reduced by chronic ethanol exposure. Attenuation of flunitrazepam efficacy was transient and returned to control levels within 6 to 24 hr after withdrawal from ethanol, but increased sensitivity to Ro15-4513 was observed as long as 8 days after withdrawal. Chronic exposure to ethanol did not alter [3H]SR 95531 ([2-(3'-carbethoxy-2'propyl)-3-amino-6-p-methoxyphenylpyridazinium bromide] binding to low-affinity GABAA receptors or muscimol stimulation of chloride flux; and did not alter [3H]Ro15-4513 or [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central BZ receptors or allosteric modulation of this binding by muscimol (i.e., muscimol-shift). These results suggest that chronic exposure to ethanol reduces coupling between BZ agonist sites and the chloride channel, and may be responsible for the development of cross-tolerance between ethanol and BZ agonists. In contrast, coupling between BZ inverse agonist sites and the chloride channel is increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to develop a procedure for assessing similarities between the interoceptive stimuli of food in the gut and various drugs known to alter food intake in rats. Rats (n = 23) were trained in a two-lever, food-reinforced, discrimination paradigm to press one lever when deprived of food for 3 hr and another lever when deprived of food for 22 hr. Criteria for stimulus control over responding were achieved after a mean of 92 (range = 26-175) training sessions. In time course tests, rats were tested when 22, 12, 6 and 3 hr food-deprived. As the number of hours of food deprivation decreased, the percentage of responses that occurred on the 3-hr food deprivation lever increased. In substitution tests, rats that were 22-hr food-deprived consistently responded as if they were 3-hr food deprived after administration of sweetened condensed milk preloads or cholecystokinin, but only occasionally after administration of water preloads, LiCl, d-amphetamine or fenfluramine. These results demonstrate that the presence of food in the gut can function as a discriminative stimulus to control lever choice in rats. Furthermore, they suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of cholecystokinin, but not d-amphetamine or fenfluramine, are similar to those of food in the gut, and support the hypothesis that cholecystokinin plays a role in the regulation of food intake.\r"

This study was undertaken to examine the effects of ligands of this binding site on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). To accomplish this we administered graded doses of the pBZD receptor agonist 4-chloro-diazepam (Ro5-4864) i.v. to catheterized, freely moving adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Serial blood samples for plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone determinations were drawn from the catheter before and after the injection of the drug. Ro5-4864 significantly stimulated ACTH and corticosterone secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. To examine whether this effect could be antagonized by the pBZD binding site antagonist PK 11195, we treated rats with PK 11195 at doses 10- and 50-times higher than Ro5-4864 before administration of a maximally effective dose of Ro5-4864. Neither dose of PK 11195 antagonized Ro5-4864-induced plasma ACTH or corticosterone elevations. However, this agent, given alone, stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release. Similarly, carbamazepine (CBZ), which binds to the pBZD binding site with low affinity, stimulated weakly the HPA in vivo, reaching statistical significance only at the highest dose tested. To examine the site(s) of action of these compounds on the HPA, we evaluated their effects on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary ACTH secretion in vitro. Ro5-4864 stimulated hypothalamic CRH, but not pituitary ACTH secretion. Neither PK 11195 nor CBZ had any agonist effect on hypothalamic CRH secretion in vitro, whereas both antagonized Ro5-4864-induced CRH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we examined the hypothesis that thromboxane mediates the renal hemodynamic response to platelet activating factor (PAF) by determining the effects of pretreatment with a selective thromboxane receptor antagonist. Infusion of platelet-activating factor into the left renal artery of normal rats in a dose that failed to alter mean arterial pressure or blood hematocrit values reduced urinary flow rate from 25.9 +/- 6.3 to 12.6 +/- 1.5 microliters/min (P less than .01), reduced effective renal plasma flow rate from 14.01 +/- 2.09 to 5.42 +/- 2.38 ml/min/kg body weight (P less than .01), reduced glomerular filtration rate from 4.81 +/- 1.00 to 1.68 +/- 0.34 ml/min/kg (P less than .03), and increased the fractional excretion of protein from 0.021 +/- 0.008 to 0.094 +/- 0.005 percent (P less than .05). Pretreatment with the selective thromboxane receptor antagonist SKF 96148 (10 mg/kg) not only prevented PAF-induced reductions in effective renal plasma flow rate and glomerular filtration rate but increased these values (effective renal plasma flow rate: 14.09 +/- 2.76 vs. 16.84 +/- 2.08 ml/min/kg, P less than .05; glomerular filtration rate: 4.42 +/- 0.43 vs. 5.50 +/- 0.59 ml/min/kg, P less than .03) and aborted proteinuria. Pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg) ameliorated PAF-induced alterations in renal hemodynamics and glomerular permselectivity in the final collection period. Infusion of lyso-PAF, a biologically inactive precursor of PAF, or of indomethacin alone or SKF 96148 alone had no significant effect on measured parameters. These observations suggest that thromboxane mediates the renal hemodynamic and permselective effects of PAF.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of kappa opioid binding sites have suggested heterogeneous binding to this class of opioid receptors. To further investigate kappa receptor heterogeneity, we analyzed the binding properties of various \"kappa-selective\" ligands in rat brain homogenates. Displacement assays were carried out using [3H]bremazocine in the presence of various displacing ligands under mu and delta receptor-blocked conditions. Homologous displacement of [3H]bremazocine produced \"shallow\" displacement which best fit a two-site model of drug-receptor interaction. Dynorphin A1-13 and U69,593 exhibited similar biphasic displacement of [3H]bremazocine. Maximal displacement by these ligands, however, represented only approximately 55% of total [3H]bremazocine binding, which suggests the existence of a third component of [3H]bremazocine binding. Biphasic displacement by dynorphin A1-13 was detected in tissue throughout the brain and the spinal cord, whereas the dynorphin-resistant component of [3H]bremazocine binding was uniquely absent in the spinal cord. U50,488H, tifluadom and ethylketocyclazocine appeared to displace from additional, dynorphin-insensitive sites, as their maximal displacement exceeded that seen with either dynorphin A1-13 or U69,593. These results strongly suggest the existence of at least three components of non-mu, non-delta [3H]bremazocine binding in the rat brain: two with differential affinity for dynorphin A1-13 and U69-593 (kappa-1 and kappa-2 sites), and a third (termed here R1) that was further resolved into two binding sites by bremazocine. Preliminary analysis of the R1 component using naloxone revealed one high-affinity site, which may be opiate in nature, and a second site whose binding properties closely resemble those of the sigma receptor described by others.\r"

Subjects were allowed to self-administer i.v. saline or cocaine (8, 16 or 32 mg) in daily 3-hr sessions to establish baseline levels of self-administration, self-reported effects of the drug and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Each subject was then maintained on daily doses of desipramine for 3 to 4 weeks, after which a second cocaine self-administration dose-response curve was generated under desipramine maintenance. This maintenance had no effect on cocaine self-administration. There was, however, a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure during desipramine maintenance. Desipramine maintenance also resulted in a change in the profile of cocaine's self-reported effects. In some cases (e.g., Arousal and Vigor on the Profile of Mood States, Benzedrine Group scale on the Addiction Research Center Inventory), reports of cocaine's effects were significantly reduced under conditions of desipramine maintenance, and in others (e.g., Anxiety, Anger and Confusion on the Profile of Mood States), those reports were significantly increased. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in subjects response to an \"I want cocaine\" question while under desipramine maintenance. The data suggest that desipramine does not affect the reinforcing properties of cocaine, but may interfere with its other stimulus properties. Furthermore, the cardiovascular effects of desipramine appear to have the potential for toxicity when that drug is administered in combination with cocaine.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of bombesin (BBS) on ion transport in the mouse isolated jejunum were studied in full thickness (intact) or serosal stripped (mucosal) sheets of jejunum mounted in Ussing chambers. Although serosal BBS (0.1-30 nM) induced a concentration-related increase in transmural potential difference (PD) and short-circuit current (Isc) without altering conductance in both preparations, the peptide was more potent and efficacious in mucosal than in intact tissues. In all preparations, pretreatment with BBS abolished the effects of a subsequent administration of BBS showing the rapid development of desensitization. In intact tissues, serosal pretreatment with either chlorisondamine (3 microM) or tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM) decreased, but did not abolish BBS action. Meanwhile, atropine pretreatment (3 microM) did not affect the BBS response. In these tissues, previous blockade of NaCl cotransport by furosemide (300 microM) decreased BBS (30 nM) stimulation of PD or Isc. In mucosal preparations, tetrodotoxin pretreatment (0.1 microM) similarly reduced but did not eliminate BBS (3 nM) stimulation of PD or Isc, whereas atropine pretreatment (1 microM) again had no effect on BBS action. In contrast in these mucosal tissues, furosemide pretreatment (300 microM) did not modify the BBS response. Furthermore, carbachol pretreatment (10 microM) prevented completely the tetrodotoxin-resistant action of BBS. These findings in vitro suggest that the increase of PD and Isc following BBS administration in isolated mouse jejunum is associated with three different levels of action of this peptide: BBS may act on noncholinergic nerves, at pre- and post-ganglionic levels, as well as directly on the enterocyte.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Amiloride inhibited [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine binding to alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in a concentration-dependent manner. Amiloride increased Kd values for [3H]rauwolscine without affecting the maximum binding of [3H]prazosin. These results suggest that the drug interacts with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor binding sites in a competitive manner and with the alpha-2 adrenoceptor binding sites in a noncompetitive manner. Amiloride reduced maximal contractile responses to agonists selective for both alpha adrenoceptors and to elevated K+, the EC50 values were increased by about 10-fold in the presence of amiloride. In Ca+(+)-free Krebs' solution, contractions induced in saphenous vein after addition of Ca++ in saphenous vein in the presence of adrenoceptor agonists were inhibited by amiloride. Our results suggest that amiloride reduced alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated responses and inhibited Ca++ influx.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the dorsal raphe selectively inhibited the firing rate of slowly firing (less than 4 spikes/sec) DA neurons. The 5-HT-1A agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine preferentially increased the firing rate of slowly firing DA neurons, but did not alter the responsiveness of these cells to quinpirole-induced inhibition of firing rate. This increase in firing rate was not observed following depletion of brain 5-HT by the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. The 5-HT-1B agonists trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine and M-chlorophenylpiperazine had only weak inhibitory effects on the firing rates of DA neurons, and also failed to alter the responsiveness of DA neurons to quinpirole-induced inhibition. Depletion of brain 5-HT (greater than 80%) by either para-chlorophenylalanine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine eliminated the rate-dependent nature of quinpirole-induced inhibition of nigrostriatal DA neurons, while having limited effects on the basal electrophysiological activity of these cells. These data suggest that 5-HT systems exert subtle influences on the activity and pharmacological responsiveness of nigrostriatal DA neurons.\r"

In addition, NT8-13 and Nacetyl-NT8-13, the carboxy-terminal-containing hexapeptides, were much more effective as DA releasers than the amino-terminal, NT1-6 peptide. The potency and efficacy of NT in inducing DA release was markedly enhanced by increases in the extracellular concentration of potassium (K+). Similar to electrical stimulation and to elevated extracellular K+, NT-induced DA release was inhibited by 70% in the presence of 0.13 mM calcium. Desensitization to NT was observed after a first exposure to NT for 2.5 to 10 min, despite a 20- to 85-min washout period between exposures, with NT-free medium. The loss of response was not due to degradation or inactivation of the peptide, nor it was due to activation of DA autoreceptors or the DA transporter. NT-induced desensitization was not associated to a loss of responsiveness to DA release elicited by electrical stimulation or by high K+. In addition, desensitization occurred even if NT-induced DA release was markedly enhanced by high extracellular K+ (10 and 15 mM). Inhibition of NT-induced DA release by low calcium (on the first exposure) did not prevent the development of desensitization. Similar to the parent peptide, desensitization was observed with the active carboxy-terminal NT fragments. However, a first exposure to NT1-6 did not induce desensitization to NT8-13. These results are compatible with the view that NT-induced DA release and the development of desensitization are mediated through an action of NT on NT receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[3H]Idazoxan binding to myometrial membrane fractions was saturable, reversible, specific and of high affinity. The affinity did not vary significantly between the four groups of ewes (2.8 less than KD less than 4.7 nM). Maximal binding capacity varied significantly among groups: binding of [3H]idazoxan was lower in control ovariectomized ewes than in either estradiol or progestagen plus estrogen-treated ewes (maximal binding capacity, 73 +/- 11 fmol/mg of protein vs. 108 +/- 16 and 318 +/- 65, respectively). The highest [3H]idazoxan binding was measured in pregnant ewes (maximal binding capacity, 1302 +/- 256 fmol/mg of protein). Based on the saturation studies with accurate nonspecific binding definition (phentolamine vs. epinephrine), and on the relative order of potency for selected adrenergic drugs, it could be stated that the binding sites labeled by [3H]idazoxan in our study exhibited most of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor properties. Nevertheless, these alpha-2 adrenoceptors obviously differed from the standard alpha-2A-subtype based on Ki values obtained with yohimbine and prazosin in competition studies of [3H]idazoxan binding. The increase in the number of alpha-2 adrenoceptors under progesterone domination, and especially during gestation, supported the hypothesis that this adrenoceptor subtype could play a major role in the control of the motility pattern of the ovine pregnant uterus.\r"

Endogenous serotonin was released at a lower rate than tritiated serotonin; endogenous serotonin release was stimulated by potassium depolarization but was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, veratridine or the absence of calcium. Carbachol, norepinephrine, clonidine and isoproterenol decreased release of tritiated serotonin but had less or reverse effect on release of endogenous serotonin.

Because recent studies suggest that CRF may serve as a neurotransmitter in the major noradrenergic nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), it was hypothesized that antidepressants interfere with the putative neurotransmitter role of CRF in the LC by either: 1) decreasing release of CRF; 2) pharmacologically antagonizing CRF; or 3) functionally antagonizing CRF by producing effects on LC cells that oppose these of CRF. In order to test this hypothesis, the effects of acute and chronic administration of two antidepressants, a norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (desmethylimipramine, DMI) and a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (sertraline, SER), on LC spontaneous discharge, LC sensory evoked discharge, LC activation by a stressor and LC activation by CRF, were compared in halothane-anesthetized rats. Acute i.v. administration of DMI decreased both LC spontaneous discharge and discharge evoked by repeated sciatic nerve stimulation. In contrast, acute i.v. SER administration decreased only evoked LC discharge rate. Chronic DMI administration (10.0 mg/kg/day, i.p., 21 days) resulted in tolerance to its effects on spontaneous and sensory-evoked LC discharge. However, chronic DMI administration attenuated LC activation by hemodynamic stress, which is thought to require CRF release. LC activation by intracerebroventricular CRF was not altered in the chronic DMI rats. In contrast to DMI, chronic SER (10 mg/kg/day, i.p., 21 days) did not alter LC activation by either stress of CRF. However, the response of LC cells to repeated sciatic nerve stimulation was somewhat enhanced in chronic SER rats. This is an effect that is opposite that produced by CRF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The potency of SQ 30,741 was demonstrated in other anesthetized monkeys by a 8.5 +/- 1.1-fold (n = 3) shift to the right in the U-46,619 dose-response for renal vasoconstriction. The effect of SQ 30,741 (n = 5) on pre-existing renal vasoconstriction was determined using conscious monkeys in which an individually tailored dose of U-46,619 was chosen to sustain an average 82% reduction in blood flow. An arterial injection of SQ 30,741 rapidly returned flow to base-line values, but this antagonism was limited in duration, and flow again reached the nadir within 46 +/- 7 min of continuous U-46,619 infusion.

This action was dose-dependent, was shared by other nonhydrolyzable guanyl nucleotides such as GMP-phencyclidine hydrochloride and GMP-PMP, as well as by fluoride, and was calcium-independent. Contrarily, no effect was observed even at doses of GTP gamma S as high as 10 microM when the same protocol was repeated on identical acinar preparations from mice fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet. This regimen is known to uncouple secretagogue-receptor occupancy from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation in pancreatic acinar cells and lead to necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis. These data lead us to conclude that the ethionine-induced inactivation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent pancreatic phosphoinositidase C in pancreatic acinar cells is not the result of either a decrease in GTP level or a decrease in GTP availability. These findings further confirm previous work from this laboratory, which has shown that the biochemical lesion induced by this diet occurs after the agonist-receptor binding step. The diet-induced lesion could be either at the level of the G-protein that couples the enzyme with the receptor or at the level of the phospholipase itself.\r"

This effect was antagonized by intra-A10 administration of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA antagonist, bicuculline, and by peripheral administration of haloperidol, and was associated with an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine metabolites in the nucleus accumbens. Although microinjection of the gamma-aminobutyric acidB agonist, baclofen, into the A10 region did not alter motor activity, it abolished the capacity of intra-A10 injection of mu opioid agonist, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly(ol), or muscimol to increase motor activity. Baclofen also prevented the motor stimulant response to peripheral injection of cocaine or amphetamine, but was ineffective in blocking caffeine-induced behavioral activity. Pretreatment with baclofen prevented the capacity of a mu opioid agonist to elevate dopamine metabolite levels in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex in postmortem tissue. Baclofen also prevented the elevation of extracellular dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens produced by injection of a mu opioid agonist into the A10 region, as measured in the conscious rat with in vivo dialysis. Finally, when dopamine metabolite levels were elevated in the prefrontal cortex by mild footshock, it was shown that pretreatment with baclofen in the A10 region abolished this response. These data support electrophysiological studies suggesting that activation of gamma-aminobutyric acidB receptors on dopamine perikarya inhibits dopaminergic activity, while activation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors results in an indirect disinhibition of dopaminergic function.\r"

CEC inhibition was irreversible, but displayed a competitive pattern characterized by rightward shifts of the norepinephrine EC50 with little or no decrease in maximum response. CEC appeared to shift response to a discrete but lower affinity state. The time course for irreversible inhibition by 10 microM CEC was faster for rat aorta (T1/2 = 18 min) than for rabbit aorta (T1/2 = 118 min) indicating a difference either in receptor occupation or in the rate of alkylation after occupation. Measurements of reversible CEC affinity in rabbit aorta yielded a pKB of 6.3 and the rate of alkylation was not significantly increased at 100 microM CEC so that lower occupation could not account for the difference. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine significantly increased the sensitivity of rabbit aorta to CEC indicating a role for receptor reserve in determining the extent of CEC inhibition. Membrane fluidity measured by diphenylhexatriene fluorescence was lower in rabbit than rat aorta; however, dimethylsulfoxide or ethanol failed to alter the rate of irreversible CEC inhibition in the rabbit. Protein kinase C activation with phorbol dibutyrate failed to alter CEC alkylation in rabbit aorta. WB 4101 [2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)-aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane] affinity was higher in rabbit aorta (pKB = 8.9) than rat aorta (pKB = 8.3) consistent with a contribution of alpha-1A and alpha-1B adrenergic receptor subtypes to differences in CEC sensitivity, although the difference was not as great as would be predicted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The in vivo model of BBB transport utilized an internal carotid artery perfusion/capillary depletion method in anesthetized rats. BBB permeability in vivo and in vitro was measured for 15 radiolabeled drugs and for L-[3H]dopa, D-[14C]glucose and [3H]albumin. [3H]- or [14C]sucrose was used in vivo as a blood volume reference. Lipid solubility of each drug was measured based on the 1-octanol/Ringer's partition coefficient.

  ".W": "Dissociated cell cultures from the pontine area of embryonic rat brain were used to study the sensitivity of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT)) neurons to the neurotoxins 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). Treatment with MPTP (up to 100 microM) for 7 days did not cause degeneration of 5-HT neurons. A 50% inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake caused by 100 microM MPTP was a direct effect on the 5-HT uptake carrier, reversed by washing for 7 days. Incubation of cultures with MPTP increased the intraneuronal levels of 5-HT and reduced the levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggesting a reduction in 5-HT metabolism. MPTP reduced monoamine oxidase activity in the cultures, which probably led to the reduction in 5-HT metabolism. Exposure to MPP+ (0.5-10 microM) for 4 to 7 days decreased [3H]5-HT uptake and induced loss of neurons stained with antibodies against 5-HT. Comparison between 5-HT and dopamine (DA) neurons indicated a differential sensitivity to MPP+ toxicity with DA neurons being more susceptible. Analysis of the competition of MPP+ with the natural substrates for uptake sites of 5-HT and DA neurons demonstrated higher affinity of MPP+ for DA compared to 5-HT neurons. The lower affinity of MPP+ for 5-HT neurons could be responsible for the accumulation of lower MPP+ levels observed in pontine cultures and explain the resistance of 5-HT neurons to this toxin.\r"

  ".U": "90250823\r", 
  ".W": "Although type II diabetes is associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, duration of diabetes and severity of glycemia are strongly associated only with the former. Since prediabetic individuals are hyperinsulinemia, and since hyperinsulinemia may be a cardiovascular risk factor, we hypothesized that prediabetic individuals might have an atherogenic pattern of risk factors even before the onset of clinical diabetes, thereby explaining the relative lack of an association of macrovascular complications with either glycemic severity or disease duration. We documented the cardiovascular risk factor status of 614 initially nondiabetic Mexican Americans who later participated in an 8-year follow-up of the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Individuals who were nondiabetic at the time of baseline examination, but who subsequently developed type II diabetes (ie, confirmed prediabetic subjects, n = 43), had higher levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose and insulin, 2-hour glucose, body mass index, and blood pressure, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than subjects who remained nondiabetic (n = 571). Most of these differences persisted after adjustment for obesity and/or level of glycemia, but were abolished after adjustment for fasting insulin concentration. When subjects with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline (n = 106) were eliminated, the more atherogenic pattern of cardiovascular risk factors was still evident (and statistically significant) among initially normoglycemic prediabetic subjects. These results indicate that prediabetic subjects have an atherogenic pattern of risk factors (possibly caused by obesity, hyperglycemia, and especially hyperinsulinemia), which may be present for many years and may contribute to the risk of macrovascular disease as much as the duration of clinical diabetes itself.\r"

Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 52 subjects (54%), and 38 subjects (39%) were found to have abnormal anal cytological findings; anal intraepithelial neoplasia was detected in 15 specimens (15%). Abnormalities on anal cytological smear were significantly associated with the presence of human papillomavirus DNA, with a risk ratio of 4.6. Infection with multiple human papillomavirus types was common (12%) and was associated with a risk ratio for cytological abnormalities of 39.0. Median T4 counts of subjects with abnormal cytological findings were significantly lower than those with normal findings. These studies indicate that immunosuppressed male homosexuals have a high prevalence of anal human papillomavirus infection and anal intraepithelial neoplasia, and this population may be at significant risk for the development of anal cancer.\r"

Among HPV-positive patients, the risk of overall relapse did not differ with individual HPV types. Compared with HPV-positive patients, those with no detectable HPV DNA had a 2.6 times higher risk of overall relapse (p less than 0.05) and 4.5 times higher risk of distant metastases (p less than 0.01). The 24-month relapse-free survival rate in HPV-positive patients was significantly higher than that in HPV-negative patients (77% vs 40%), and the difference was similar (91% vs 56%) among those who were node-negative. These data indicate that HPV-negative cervical carcinomas may represent a biologically distinct subset of tumours that carry a poorer prognosis than do HPV-positive cancers.\r"

One allele of her insulin-receptor gene inherited from her mother contained a 1.2 kb deletion arising from a recombination between two Alu elements. The deletion removed the 14th exon in the beta subunit and altered the reading frame, to produce a stop codon after aminoacid 867. Pedigree analysis indicated that this mutation alone will not cause diabetes, and the proband is possibly a compound heterozygote. 4 other members of her family were heterozygous for the same mutation; all 4 had a decrease in insulin binding and slight impairment of glucose tolerance. Perhaps the same mutation is an underlying feature of some cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

The 10 AEC-positive children had received a total of 12 grafts; 9 were lost and 3 were saved by means of plasma exchange. The 11 children without AEC received 11 grafts; 3 were lost, 2 owing to thrombosis. The correlation between the presence of AEC and graft rejection was highly significant. AEC have since been found in adult transplant recipients who suffered clinically similar graft failure, both at Guy's Hospital and at another hospital. The apparent spread of the antibody suggests an infective agent, but until the cause is identified kidney transplants in the paediatric unit have been suspended.\r"

The focus of the outbreak (12 cases) was the Hadera subdistrict, one of two subdistricts where enhanced inactivated poliovaccine (eIPV) had been the only poliovaccine used for infants since 1982. 9 of the 15 victims were 15 years or older, and 9 had previously been immunised with at least three doses of oral poliovaccine (OPV). The authors are divided in their interpretation of the findings. One group considered that the likely causative factors were the greater susceptibility of young adults previously vaccinated with OPV as well as transmission of wild poliovirus to susceptible people by children with low gut immunity against poliovirus after vaccination with eIPV; they concluded that a vaccination programme combining eIPV with OPV is the best option for Israel in future. The other group believed the causative factors were exposure to contaminated sewage or close social contact within the epidemic foci, the presence of an epidemic strain differing from the wild Mahoney and Sabin type 1 vaccine strains, and the lower seropositivity rates and geometric mean titres of neutralising antibodies to the epidemic than to vaccine strains; they believe that eIPV is the means to achieve effective control of poliomyelitis in Israel.\r"

The average (AV), the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV), the skewness (SK) and the sharpness (S) of the density were calculated. Normal epithelium could be differentiated from abnormal by subjectively observing the shapes of the cells, the sizes of the cells and the irregularity of the cell pattern. But there were no statistical differences between the two groups with regard to the AV, SD, CV, SK and S of normal (n = 4) and abnormal (n = 8) corneal epithelial images. Simple analysis of density distribution could not be used as a parameter for the evaluation of the cells.\r"

Both animal and human investigations suggest an altered pain response in IDDM. Furthermore, it has been suggested that glucose may be an important mediating factor in these painful symptoms. In the present study, pain threshold was assessed via tail flick latency in alloxan-diabetic and control rats. In addition, tail flick latency was determined under conditions of both hyperglycemia and euglycemia in diabetic rats. Conditions of hyperglycemia resulted in a significant decrease in the tail flick latency of alloxan-diabetic rats. In contrast, tail flick latency was significantly increased in diabetic rats following normalization of blood glucose levels. It is concluded that elevated blood glucose levels contribute to a decrease in pain threshold in alloxan-diabetic rats.\r"

Yet, their existence has never actually been proven. Recently, a report was published stating that injection of a radiotracer at an acupuncture point allows the visualization of the corresponding meridian in the shape of a radioactive path which is apparent on scintiscans. The present work confirms the appearance of radioactive paths after the injection of a radiotracer at acupuncture points. However, the cross-checks made with the method used (counting the radioactivity of the venous blood, studying radioactivity of the organs which normally take up the tracer, scintiscan study of the complete meridian paths as they are described in traditional Chinese medicine and studying the effect of venous blockade on the observed radioactive paths) show that the radioactive paths in fact correspond to vascular drainage of the radiotracer.\r"

All patients were allowed supplementary pethidine (25-50 mg) if pain relief was inadequate provided that their respiratory rate was greater than 10 breaths/min and there was no pronounced CNS depression. Visual analogue pain scores (VAPS), sedation rating scores (SRS), blood samples for the determination of fentanyl concentration, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate were determined hourly for 48 h from the time of TTS system application. The first lot of TTS systems were removed after 24 h and a second lot were applied which remained in situ for a further 24 h. There was no significant difference between the patients in the TTS-fentanyl and TTS-placebo groups in the VAPS throughout the 0-12, 12-24, 24-36 and 36-48 h periods suggesting that the quality of pain relief was similar between the 2 groups. However, significantly less supplementary pethidine was administered to the TTS-fentanyl group in the 12-24, 24-36 and 36-48 h periods. In contrast, the amount of supplementary pethidine administered in the 0-12 h period was similar in both groups which was consistent with the long delay time (mean +/- S.D. value of 16.6 +/- 10 h) before clinically effective concentrations of fentanyl were obtained from the systems. The profile of side effects was similar in the 2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The threshold was increased by lidocaine and returned to pre-infusion level within 10 days. Lidocaine also increased the threshold in 4 healthy subjects, but did not affect the Hoffmann reflex.

  ".U": "90251380\r", 
  ".W": "This paper reports an investigation into the efficacy of flexible dosage amitriptyline (AMI) and brief psychotherapy individually and together in the treatment of chronic 'psychogenic' pain. The patients included in the study were drawn from those referred to a pain clinic and were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: (1) AMI + psychotherapy (N = 26), twelve 45 min weekly sessions; (2) AMI + support (N = 26), six 15 min fortnightly sessions; (3) placebo tablet + psychotherapy (N = 26), twelve 45 min weekly sessions; (4) placebo tablet + support (N = 24), six 15 min fortnightly sessions. Outcome was assessed on categorical and continuous variables administered immediately post treatment. The results indicate that amitriptyline is effective in increasing the patients' activity level and the reduction of pain intensity. Psychotherapy increases pain intensity, but tends to improve productivity. There also appears to be a role for the use of amitriptyline in combination with psychotherapy, but their interaction is a complex one. Baseline factors associated with withdrawal from treatment are reported, as well as those associated with a positive response to amitriptyline and psychotherapy respectively. Our findings offer tentative guidelines for choosing between therapies and also underline the importance of assessing more than one outcome variable in evaluating outcome. The importance of carrying treatments out in the context of a multidisciplinary pain clinic is emphasised.\r"

Blood samples were collected immediately before, in the middle of, and after a 6-week high-intensity training period as well as after a subsequent 1-year period of low-intensity training. In addition, baseline data were obtained 3 weeks before the start of the training program. Use of multivariate analyses of variance, and of analyses of variance of contrast variables, indicated a short-term effect of the high-intensity training program for beta-EP with increased levels (P less than 0.05) between the 3rd and the 6th weeks, no significant differences being obtained for CRF or beta-LPH here. Corresponding analyses with regard to the combined high and low-intensity training program revealed CRF (P less than 0.01), and beta-LPH (P less than 0.01) levels to increase over time, no long-term effect being found for beta-EP. Despite the intensity of the dynamic training program, no change was found in pain experience as measured on a visual analogue scale.\r"

A scoring system for SEP was used, in which increasing abnormalities rendered increasing scores. SEPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the median and tibial nerves were compared to perception thresholds for touch, vibration, innocuous and noxious temperature. All patients had reduced temperature sensibility, while the threshold for touch and vibration was abnormal in only 52% and 41%, respectively. Decreased touch and vibration sensibility had a high correlation with high SEP scores, while no correlation was found between reduced temperature sensibility and SEP. The patients with thalamic lesions had the most severely affected SEPs, the ones with lower brain-stem lesions were the least affected. The results support the notion that the SEP is dependent on the lemniscal pathways and that lesions of the spinothalamic pathways are crucial for the development of CPS.\r"

Patients are significantly more likely to report illnesses but not injuries among their children across 10 monthly interviews. The patients' excess in reporting of illnesses is not found for spouses or additional significant others. Overreporting does not appear to be due to illness attitudes or other discernible reporting biases, but may be partially attributable to higher rates of demoralization among the cases.

  ".W": "This study investigated the relationship between stressful life events and the onset of chronic primary headache (CPH), using both normative group ratings and self-report ratings of the desirability and the perceived impact of stressful events. We hypothesized that CPH patients (n = 63) would report significantly more stressful life events with negative impact on their life style in the year prior to headache onset compared with headache-free controls (n = 44). The prediction was fully confirmed. CPH patients were exposed to a significant increase (P less than 0.001) in their final year life change unit (LCU) totals prior to headache onset as compared to the previous corresponding time interval and to headache-free controls. Furthermore, a highly significant peaking (P less than 0.001) of negative change scores, based on personal ratings of the distress concerning life events in the same time interval, was observed in the CPH group. In terms of event content, exits or losses were prominent in being perceived as stressful. Significant differences between headache subgroups (chronic tension-type headache, migraine, mixed headache and psychogenic headache) were not found, although mixed headache sufferers reported a higher incidence of interpersonal arguments and difficulties than migrainous patients. We conclude that a sudden increase in the frequency and magnitude of stressful life events, associated with a cognitive-emotional appraisal of their negative impact on life patterns, appears to herald the onset of headache, independently of the developing clinical headache syndrome.\r"

Following a right ankle block with 0.5% bupivacaine, the sciatic nerve stimulation induced pain in the thigh and the calf but not in the foot. Despite an increase in the magnitude of stimulation by 50% (compared with the stimulation before the block) the pain was not perceived below the level of blockade. We suggest that in this case the electrical stimulation generated impulses propagated antidromically into the leg and activated nociceptors in it. The bupivacaine blockade prevented antidromic propagation of impulses into the foot, therefore pain in this region was not perceived.\r"

Electromyography revealed C7 radioculopathy and cervical laminectomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient noted improvement, however, he had recurrence of his symptoms within 1 month. Significant pain in the left arm, accompanied by swelling, persisted despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant medications. Repeat electromyography showed a resolving C7 with increased polyphasic potentials. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy was diagnosed and the patient received 3 stellate ganglion blocks with relief of the swelling, but only temporary relief of pain. He then underwent epidural injection of 60 mg of methylprednisolone. A cushingoid appearance was noted approximately 1 month later. Serum cortisol was undetectable, there was no adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, and urinary-free cortisol was below normal at 12. The patient eventually underwent a second surgical procedure for his pain and required steroid coverage. His pain subsequently showed slow improvement. Urinary-free cortisol normalized 4 months after onset; however, the patient's cushingoid appearance persisted for 12 months.\r"

  ".U": "90251388\r", 
  ".W": "Afferent impulse frequency, one of the determinants of subjective magnitude of sensation, varies with the rate of rise of stimulus intensity: the faster the increase in stimulus energy, the higher the frequency of firing for a given amount of energy. This predicts that the steeper the stimulus ramp the lower will be the threshold for perception. While such inverse relation holds for myelinated fibre mediated cold sensation and mechanical pressure sensation, the opposite has been reported for unmyelinated fibre mediated heat pain and cold pain sensations. These paradoxical results intuitively suggest possible reaction time artefact. Indeed, a fixed time interval that includes conduction of the impulses to the brain, central processing and efferent conduction, intervenes between sufficient peripheral stimulus and the voluntary signal in reaction to subjective experience. As stimulus temperature continues to rise along this time, an artefactually high threshold reading results: the steeper the temperature rise, the larger will be the artefact, particularly for submodalities with longer reaction time. The present study compared heat pain threshold, obtained through a method that involves reaction time participation, with heat pain thresholds obtained bypassing reaction time. It was found in 16 volunteers that: (a) Heat pain thresholds decreased as the rate of temperature rise increased when reaction time was not a factor (P less than 0.001). (b) Heat pain thresholds determined through the method involving reaction time participation were significantly higher than those obtained bypassing reaction time (P less than 0.01). Such difference increased with increasing rates of temperature rise. (c) Peripheral conduction velocity calculated from average reaction time was found to be approximately 0.6 m/sec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all cases but one, only stimuli considered to be nociceptive were effective in producing responses. Most of the responses were excitatory. The majority of the responsive neurons were located in the submedius (SM), mediodorsal (MD), centrolateral, paracentral, ventromedial (VM) nuclei and medial parts of the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. A few nociceptive neurons were also recorded in anteromedial (AM), reuniens and a few other nearby regions of thalamus. Most neurons could be activated by stimuli applied bilaterally and frequently to large regions of the body. In almost all cases the responses were maintained for the entire duration of the 15 sec stimuli used and in some cases continued after cessation of the stimuli. No marked differences in incidence of responsive neurons were found between the normal and arthritic rats or between different regions. There were also no marked differences in the spontaneous rates, magnitudes of responses, or incidence of after-discharges of neurons in the various regions of medial thalamus. These findings indicate the existence of neurons responding to nociceptive stimuli in MD, AM, VM, and VL in addition to the intralaminar nuclei and SM and suggest that all these regions may be involved in mediating various aspects of nociception.\r"

All samples from seropositive women contained IgG antibody against envelope glycoproteins gp160 and/or gp120, and 11 of 15 samples contained IgA antibodies against gp160. IgA antibodies against other viral antigens were more rarely recovered, except against the internal proteins of the virus, p18 and p25. The finding of IgA antibodies to HIV-1 in breast milk establishes that the virus elicits a local immune response in heterosexual, seropositive women. The role of local antibodies in the postnatal transmission of HIV remains to be determined.\r"

Stridor began at 11 days to 2 months of age, and four of the seven infants had transient hypercarbia on at least one occasion before study. Only one had a history of frequent vomiting; three had recurrent pneumonia. Midesophageal pH, chest and abdominal movement, exhaled carbon dioxide partial pressure, and heart rate of six of the infants were recorded for 4 to 12 hours as they slept. Esophageal pH of the seventh infant was recorded for 24 hours. In the six completely studied infants, there were persistent increases of greater than 10 mm Hg in exhaled carbon dioxide level (three infants), of greater than 10 breaths per minute in respiratory rate (four infants), and in retractions and stridor (six infants) 5 to 20 minutes after onset of reflux. Stridor improved with medical management in 48 hours (five of five infants) and disappeared in 3 weeks (three of five infants) to 2 months (one of five infants). One of these medically treated infants subsequently was treated by Nissen gastric fundoplication because of a recurrence of persistent and severe stridor. Three infants had antireflux surgery, and in two of these stridor disappeared in 48 hours. In the third infant stridor disappeared 3 weeks after surgery. Based on this experience, reflux occasionally causes stridor, probably because of acute inflammation of the upper airway. If structural anomalies are ruled out, infants with severe stridor should be examined for gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Individual scores were then added to yield a total score for each patient. An observation score of 10 or less was indicative of a generally well-appearing child, and a score of 16 or more represented an ill-appearing child. Of 126 infants enrolled, 37 (29%) had serious illness; 12 (9.5%) had culture-proven bacterial disease. Of all infants with an observation score less than or equal to 10 (n = 91), 22% had serious illness, and of all infants with an observation score greater than or equal to 16 (n = 20), only 45% had serious illness.

When assessed according to age at childbearing, there was a clear association between problem behavior and the birth of a first child prior to age 19 years. The three parental status groups studied appeared ordered in risk, with school-aged mothers having engaged in the most problem behaviors, and followed, in turn, by young adult mothers (ie, those who had a child between 19 and 21 years of age), and then by women who had not had a child by age 21 years. Young urban women who engaged in three or more problem behaviors were more likely than women who claimed no involvement in problem behaviors to subsequently have a child prior to age 19 years. In addition, black adolescents reported fewer problem behaviors than did white adolescents. When individual behaviors were analyzed, school-aged mothers were more likely than either young adult mothers or nonmothers to have reported school suspension, truancy, runaway, smoking marijuana, and fighting. Although similar results were found in both samples, the effects appeared more consistent for young urban women. In future studies, researchers must determine whether adolescent mothers are at risk for parenting difficulties because of their previous involvement in problem behaviors.\r"

With multiple regression analysis, a significant amount of variation (total R2 = 0.367, P less than or equal to .001) in sexual activity was explained by the following variables: not being in school (22.5%), no religious affiliation (4.4%), age (3.3%), less church attendance (3.0%), older age at menarche (1.9%), and not living with both parents at age 14 years (1.9%). These findings suggest that maintaining social continuity in the areas of school, church affiliation and involvement, and family structure, as well as physical maturity are associated with Hispanic adolescent girls not becoming sexually active.\r"

A number of issues such as funding and long-term viability, use of professional or paraprofessional visitors, visitor selection and supervision, and evaluation of home visitor programs require clarification and are discussed. It is concluded that home visitor programs can contribute to child health outcomes such as increased birth weight, improved prenatal care, improved maternal-infant interaction, and improved use of community resources. Pediatricians can be supportive of such programs at many levels: becoming aware of the existence and range of services of home visitor programs in their area that serve families with children and referring families to those programs; being available to advise programs that are in the planning stages; providing advocacy at the local, state, and national level for the funding and development of such programs; and taking the initiative to join multidisciplinary efforts to develop new programs.\r"

  ".U": "90251402\r", 
  ".W": "In a prospective study, 283 children who presented with a first unprovoked seizure were followed for a mean of 30 months from the time of first seizure. Subsequent seizures were experienced by 101 children (36%). The cumulative risk of seizure recurrence for the entire study group was 26% at 12 months, 36% at 24 months, 40% at 36 months, and 42% at 48 months. The cumulative risk of recurrence in the 47 children with a remote symptomatic first seizure was 37%, 53%, and 60% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, compared with a cumulative risk of 24%, 33%, and 36% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, in the 236 children who had had an idiopathic first seizure (P less than .01). In children with an idiopathic first seizure, the electroencephalogram was the most important predictor of recurrence. The cumulative risk of recurrence in the 81 children with abnormal electroencephalograms was 41%, 54%, and 56% at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively, but only 15%, 23%, and 26% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, in the 138 children with normal electroencephalograms (P less than .001). A history of epilepsy in a first-degree relative was a significant risk factor only in idiopathic cases with abnormal electroencephalograms. In children with a remote symptomatic first seizure, either a history of prior febrile seizures or the occurrence of a partial seizure were significant predictors of recurrence. Age at first seizure and duration of seizure did not affect recurrence risk in either the idiopathic or remote symptomatic group. A total of 84% of the children were not treated with antiepileptic drugs or were treated for less than 2 weeks. Only 9% were treated for longer than 3 months. Treatment did not affect the risk of recurrence. The results suggest that, even without treatment, the majority of children with a first unprovoked seizure will not experiment a recurrence. Children with an idiopathic first seizure and a normal electroencephalogram have a particularly favorable prognosis.\r"

As had been noted in the original cohort, treatment with phenobarbital, as compared with treatment with carbamazepine or no anticonvulsant, was associated with higher rates of depression (38% vs 0%, P = .04). Depression associated with phenobarbital treatment at intake did not remit spontaneously on follow-up as long as phenobarbital use continued. Those patients treated with phenobarbital who were previously depressed and whose medication was changed to either carbamazepine or no medication showed nonsignificant trends toward declines in both the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms. These results provide further evidence that treatment with phenobarbital increases the risk for depression in epileptic patients and should be avoided when clinically feasible, particularly in patients with a personal or family history of affective disorder. Epileptic patients who receive phenobarbital because of clinical considerations should be monitored closely for symptoms of an affective disorder, and if depression is detected, a change to an alternative anticonvulsant may result in amelioration of depressive symptomatology.\r"

The addition of full-time attending staff, neonatal specialists, and family practice residents was used by one third of the study hospitals. All but one hospital used more than one type of personnel to do residents' work. Some substitution methods seem more stable than others, but all situations in which the staff available was barely able to provide necessary services appear unstable. Physicians generally agreed that residents are the optimal hospital staff provider.\r"

In a geographically defined population, we ascertained the prevalence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children born in Oregon from 1971 through 1986. Clinical and anatomic data were extracted from the charts of the 98 affected children and the survival rate was calculated. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurred in 0.162 per 1000 live births in Oregon during this period. No syndrome complex was prevalent and 84% were free of other congenital malformations. However, there was an increased occurrence of congenital heart defects in first-degree relatives of probands with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Of the affected children 15 +/- 4% died on the first day of life, 70 +/- 5% died within the first week, and 91 +/- 3% died within 30 days. No secular change in survival occurred during the study. Palliation with the Norwood procedure was performed in 20 children. Although survival was significantly improved with this surgery (P = .01), the effect was observed principally through 30 days of life and only one of these children remains alive. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a lethal congenital heart defect in children and poses management and ethical dilemmas.\r"

Overt central nervous system malformations, including 3 cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum and 1 case of holoprosencephaly, were seen in 4 infants (10%). Micrencephaly (brain weight at autopsy more than 2 SDs below the mean for age) was found in 27% of the infants. An immature cortical mantle was seen in 21% of the study group. Seven infants (17%) had specific recognizable patterns of malformation. The absence of dysmorphic physical features did not preclude overt or subtle central nervous system malformations. Conversely, the presence of dysmorphic features did not reliably indicate an underlying brain anomaly. Infants who had hypoplastic left heart syndrome as one of multiple nonneurologic malformations were more likely to have micrencephaly than those infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome as an isolated abnormality. Occurrence of developmental neuropathology was elevated in those infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who did not have a recognizable pattern of malformation but who were small for gestational age, microcephalic, or had ocular abnormalities. Infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome deserve careful genetic, opthalmologic, and neurologic evaluations, imaging of their intracranial anatomy, and long-term neurologic follow-up.\r"

Detailed postmortem neuropathologic examinations showed that 55% of the infants were free of acquired brain lesions. However, the other 45% had combinations of hypoxic-ischemic lesions and intracranial hemorrhage. Central nervous system perfusion and glucose-oxygen delivery appeared to be important factors in the occurrence of hypoxic-ischemic lesions or intracranial hemorrhage, whereas acidosis and hypercarbia were not. Cerebral necrosis may be a predisposing factor for a major intracranial hemorrhage. A duration of cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic total circulatory arrest longer than 40 minutes was associated with a higher incidence of acquired neuropathology. These results indicate that the majority of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are free of acquired neuropathology and suggest practical ways to reduce the risks in the others.\r"

In man, this steroid acts on a variety of androgen-responsive target tissues to mediate such diverse endocrine processes as male sexual differentiation in the fetus and prostatic growth in men. Here we describe the isolation, structure, and expression of a cDNA encoding the human steroid 5 alpha-reductase. A rat cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to screen a human prostate cDNA library. A 2.1-kilobase cDNA was identified and DNA sequence analysis indicated that the human steroid 5 alpha-reductase was a hydrophobic protein of 259 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 29,462. A comparison of the human and rat protein sequences revealed a 60% identity. Transfection of expression vectors containing the human and rat cDNAs into simian COS cells resulted in the synthesis of high levels of steroid 5 alpha-reductase enzyme activity. Both enzymes expressed in COS cells showed similar substrate specificities for naturally occurring steroid hormones. However, synthetic 4-azasteroids demonstrated marked differences in their abilities to inhibit the human and rat steroid 5 alpha-reductases.\r"

  ".W": "Most current gene transfer methods function satisfactorily in specialized systems involving established cell lines but are often not applicable with nonadherent, primary hematopoietic cells, which are notoriously difficult to transfect. To approach this problem, we have investigated an alternative method of gene transfer, \"transferrinfection,\" in which DNA complexed to transferrin-polycation conjugates is introduced into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis [Wagner, E., Zenke, M., Cotten, M., Beug, H. & Birnstiel, M. L. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 3410-3414]. We show here that transferrin-polylysine and transferrin-protamine, when complexed to plasmid DNA containing a luciferase reporter gene, is efficiently bound and moved into avian erythroblasts by endocytosis. Successful transfer and expression of the luciferase reporter gene depends on specific interaction of the transferrin-polylysine-DNA complex with the transferrin receptor and occurs in a significant fraction (greater than 95%) of the cells. Gene transfer efficiency by transferrinfection is lower than with an optimized DEAE-dextran transfection method but reaches similar efficiencies when the cells are treated with chloroquine. Because the procedure in the absence of chloroquine is completely nontoxic to cells, a constant expression level of transferred genes may be maintained by repeated additions of transferrin-polylysine-DNA complex. In addition, the usefulness of transferrinfection for gene transfer into primary hematopoietic cells is demonstrated.\r"

A comparison with linkage data indicates that 1 centimorgan (cM) in this region corresponds to about 600 kb.

Several loci, including the gene encoding steroid sulfatase (STS) and the loci for the X-linked recessive form of chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX) and for Kallmann syndrome (KAL) have been placed relative to the Xp telomere. CDPX is located between 2650 and 5550 kb from Xpter, and STS is located between 7250 and 7830 kb from Xpter. KAL maps to an interval of 350 kb between 8600 and 8950 kb from the telomere.

We find that HPRT replicates at different times during the period of DNA synthesis (S phase), depending on its activity: It replicates in early S phase, when expressed (on the active X chromosome), and in late S phase when silent (on the inactive X chromosome). Furthermore, when reactivated, the derepressed locus is earlier replicating, supporting a relationship between replication and transcription. Neither F9 allele is expressed in these cells, and both replicate in the second half of S phase, (slightly earlier on active than on inactive X chromosome).\r"

In this study we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of gp120 also contains conserved residues critical for binding to CD4 and that gp120-CD4 interactions can be blocked by an antiserum with binding specificity to an N-terminal region of gp120. These results suggest that not all potential CD4 binding sites are present in the C-terminal region of gp120 and that an alternative HIV vaccine development strategy may have to include the N-terminal gp120 region as a component to raise effective CD4-blocking antibodies.\r"

Stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe results in the conversion of approximately 30% of native protein kinase C to protein kinase M, with little evidence of further degradation. Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, on the other hand, causes only a transient formation of protein kinase M, with complete loss of total kinase activity. These differences are related to the differences in biochemical responses, reported earlier, in neutrophils exposed to these two activators.\r"

The Debye-Waller factor is expanded in terms of the effective normal modes whose amplitudes and eigenvectors are experimentally determined by the crystallographic refinement. In contrast to the conventional method, the atomic motions are treated generally as anisotropic and concerted. This method is assessed by using the simulated x-ray data given by a Monte Carlo simulation of human lysozyme. In this article, we refine the dynamic structure by fixing the average static structure to exact coordinates. It is found that the normal mode refinement, using a smaller number of variables, gives a better R factor and more information on the dynamics (anisotropy and collectivity in the motion).\r"

As a first step to understanding the mechanisms regulating Ly-5 alternative splicing, and thus determining Ly-5 isoforms, a minigene representing exons 3-7 was transfected into Ly-5-expressor T cells and B cells and into nonexpressor L cells for comparison of splicing patterns. We conclude that all the information required for faithful splice-site selection according to cell type is contained within the resulting pre-mRNA. The splicing pattern manifested by nonexpressor L cells may represent a default and nonregulated type. We postulate trans-acting factor(s) to account for the selection of appropriate exons, and we provide support for this interpretation from analysis of fused hybrid T-B cells, which exhibited B-cell specific Ly-5 transcripts. Splicing patterns were well conserved despite substantial disruption of constructs. However, extensive deletion analyses suggested that cis sequences flanking and within exon 6 affect the exclusion of that exon in T cells.\r"

The virus contains a selectable gene encoding histidinol dehydrogenase (his) in the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). When the virus is passaged, duplication of LTRs places his sequences just 30 nucleotides from the adjacent cellular DNA. As a result, selection for histidinol resistance generates cell clones in which his is expressed on transcripts initiating in the flanking cellular DNA. Upstream cellular sequences, cloned after amplification by polymerase chain reaction, hybridized to RNA from uninfected cells, indicating that the adjacent promoters were transcriptionally active prior to virus integration. Two cloned transcribed flanking sequences also contained highly active transcriptional promoters, as estimated by their ability to activate expression of a linked reporter gene. Thus, U3His vectors provide a rapid and efficient means to isolate promoters active in different cell types. Moreover, by selecting for cell clones containing proviruses integrated in expressed genes, the virus may make an effective insertional mutagen.\r"

Although the transcriptional response is most commonly induced by temperature elevation, the biochemical events involved in HSF activation in vivo can also be triggered at normal physiological temperatures by chemicals that inhibit metabolic processes. We have used a HeLa cell-free system in which HSF DNA-binding is activated by conditions that affect protein conformation, including increasing concentrations of hydrogen ions, urea, or nonionic detergents. Treatment with calcium ions also results in a concentration- and time-dependent activation of HSF in vitro. Pretreatment with each of these biochemical conditions reduces the temperature dependence for HSF activation in vitro. These results suggest that HSF is activated either directly by undergoing a conformational change or indirectly through interactions with unfolded proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90251635\r", 
  ".W": "Formation of the covalently stabilized complex of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) with neutrophil elastase, the archetype of serine proteinase inhibitor serpin-enzyme complexes, is associated with structural rearrangement of the alpha 1-AT molecule and hydrolysis of a reactive-site peptide bond. An approximately 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal cleavage fragment is generated. alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes are biologically active, possessing chemotactic activity and mediating increases in expression of the alpha 1-AT gene in human monocytes and macrophages. This suggested that structural rearrangement of the alpha 1-AT molecule, during formation of a complex with elastase, exposes a domain that is recognized by a specific cell surface receptor or receptors. To test this hypothesis, the known three-dimensional structure of alpha 1-AT and comparisons of the primary structures of the serpins were used to select a potentially exteriorly exposed and highly conserved region in the complexed form of alpha 1-AT as a candidate ligand (carboxyl-terminal fragment, amino acids 359-374). We show here that synthetic peptides based on the sequence of this region bind specifically and saturably to human hepatoma cells and human monocytes (Kd = 4.0 X 10(-8) M, 4.5 X 10(5) plasma membrane receptors per cell) and mediate increases in synthesis of alpha 1-AT. Binding of peptide 105Y (Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-Glu-Val-Lys-Phe-Asn-Lys-Pro-Phe-Val-Tyr-Leu-Ile) is blocked by alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes, antithrombin III (AT III)-thrombin complexes, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT)-cathepsin G complexes, and, to a lesser extent, complement component C1 inhibitor-C1s complexes, but not by the corresponding native proteins. Binding of peptide 105Y is also blocked by peptides with sequence corresponding to carboxy-terminal fragments of the serpins AT III and alpha 1-ACT, but not by peptides having the sequence of the extreme amino terminus of alpha 1-AT. The results also show that peptide 105Y inhibits binding of 125I-labeled alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes. Thus, these studies demonstrate an abundant, relatively high-affinity cell surface receptor which recognizes serpin-enzyme complexes (SEC receptor). This receptor is capable of modulating the production of at least one of the serpins, alpha 1-AT. Since the ligand specificity is similar to that previously described for in vivo clearance of serpin-enzyme complexes, the SEC receptor may also be involved in the clearance of certain serpin-enzyme complexes.\r"

The anticoagulant property has been removed from chemically modified heparin without loss of antiproliferative effect but use of such compounds is still limited. In this study ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer matrices containing standard and modified heparin were placed adjacent to rat carotid arteries at the time of balloon dendothelialization. After 14 days arterial occlusion by smooth muscle cell proliferation was defined. Matrix delivery of both heparin compounds effectively diminished this proliferation in comparison to controls without producing systemic anticoagulation or side effects. In addition, this mode of therapy appeared more effective than the administration of the same agents by either intravenous pumps or heparin/polymer matrices placed in a subcutaneous site distant from the injured carotid artery. Thus, heparin's inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation after vascular injury might be most effective within the microenvironment of the injured vessel wall, and the accelerated atherosclerosis or restenosis that often follows angioplasty and other vascular interventions might best be treated with site-specific therapy.\r"

  ".U": "90251640\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that the transcription of the gene designated d5 is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells and that this NGF induction is repressed by cAMP. In this paper we demonstrate that d5 is a member of a gene family that contains several hundred members, which is closely related to retroviruses and retrotransposons, as demonstrated by the following observations: (i) the original d5 cDNA hybridized to numerous restriction fragments in genomic DNA; (ii) d5 cDNA hybridized to genomic clones with various intensities, and genomic clones can be isolated with a frequency suggesting that this family includes several hundred members; and (iii) there were minor sequence variations in four independently isolated cDNA clones that were homologous to d5 cDNA. Primer extension studies show that initiation of the 5.7-kilobase d5 mRNA(s) occurs at a unique site relative to a synthetic primer. The 5' end of the cDNA sequence was homologous to Rasheed rat sarcoma virus; and a genomic clone contained several elements that are typical of a long terminal repeat (LTR), including a CCAAT box, a TATA box, a primer binding site, a poly(A) addition signal, and a poly(A) addition site. Furthermore, there is a LTR at the 3' end of at least one of the genes in this family, and there appeared to be a four-base duplication at the probable site of integration into host DNA. Since several members of this family retain responses to NGF and cAMP, we conclude that the regulatory elements present in the LTR have been conserved in many members of this family. We have named this family of genes the NICER elements because they are a family of NGF-inducible cAMP-extinguishable retrovirus-like elements.\r"

Ablated pigeons show unaffected cardiac responses to odorous stimuli but altered homing behavior. After the operation, the birds were trained by repeated flock releases along with control birds from a site 40 km from the loft. After being released singly from this familiar site, the ablated birds turned out to be unaffected by the operation. In releases from two unfamiliar sites, ablated birds, unlike control birds, were not homeward oriented and were mostly lost. The ablation of the pyriform cortex has the same effect on homing behavior as olfactory deprivation. It can be concluded that the pyriform cortex plays an important role in the specific mechanisms linking olfactory inputs with the navigational response.\r"

  ".U": "90251642\r", 
  ".W": "Depending on the number or the length of exposure, application of serotonin can produce either short-term or long-term presynaptic facilitation of Aplysia sensory-to-motor synapses. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a heterodimer of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits, has been shown to become stably activated only during long-term facilitation. Both acquisition of long-term facilitation and persistent activation of the kinase is blocked by anisomycin, an effective, reversible, and specific inhibitor of protein synthesis in Aplysia. We report here that 2-hr exposure of pleural sensory cells to serotonin lowers the concentration of regulatory subunits but does not change the concentration of catalytic subunits, as assayed 24 hr later; 5-min exposure to serotonin has no effect on either type of subunit. Increasing intracellular cAMP with a permeable analog of cAMP together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine also decreased regulatory subunits, suggesting that cAMP is the second messenger mediating serotonin action. Anisomycin blocked the loss of regulatory subunits only when applied with serotonin; application after the 2-hr treatment with serotonin had no effect. In the Aplysia accessory radula contractor muscle, prolonged exposure to serotonin or to the peptide transmitter small cardioactive peptide B, both of which produce large increases in intracellular cAMP, does not decrease regulatory subunits. This mechanism of regulating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase therefore may be specific to the nervous system. We conclude that during long-term facilitation, new protein is synthesized in response to the facilitatory stimulus, which changes the ratio of subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This alteration in ratio could persistently activate the kinase and produce the persistent phosphorylation seen in long-term facilitated sensory cells.\r"

Rat pituitaries from euthyroid control animals and those rendered hypothyroid by methimazole treatment were incubated with [3H]glucosamine in vitro. Secreted TSH was purified, and oligosaccharides were enzymatically released and characterized by anion-exchange HPLC. In perinatal hypothyroid animals compared with control animals, oligosaccharides from TSH alpha and beta subunits contained more species with three or more negative charges. Moreover, perinatal hypothyroid animals demonstrated a dramatic increase in the ratio of sialylated to sulfated species within oligosaccharides of the same negative charge (2.9- to 7.4-fold increase for TSH-alpha; 15.1- to 25.5-fold increase for TSH-beta). In mature hypothyroid 9-week-old animals compared with control animals, changes were less pronounced, suggesting that endocrine regulation of oligosaccharide structure is dependent upon the maturational state of the animal. These changes were specific for TSH because glycosylation of free alpha subunit (synthesized by the thyrotroph and gonadotroph) and of total glycoproteins was minimally altered by hypothyroidism. Together, these data provide direct evidence and characterization of specific changes in the structure of a secreted pituitary glycoprotein hormone occurring as a result of in vivo endocrine alterations during early development. Moreover, they provide a potential structural basis to explain the delayed clearance of both TSH and the gonadotropins with end-organ deficiency, which may have important implications for the in vivo biological activities of these hormones. Specifically, such posttranslational changes may be an important adaptive response to prevent the consequences of endocrine deficiency during early development.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a region in the 5' flanking sequence of the glutathione S-transferase (RX:glutathione R-transferase, EC 2.5.1.18) Ya subunit gene that contains a unique xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE). The regulatory region spans nucleotides -722 to -682 of the 5' flanking sequence and is responsible for part of the basal level as well as inducible expression of the Ya subunit gene by planar aromatic compounds such as beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) and 3-methyl-cholanthrene. The DNA sequence of this region (beta-NF-responsive element) is distinct from the DNA sequence of the XRE found in the cytochrome P-450 IA1 gene. In addition to the region containing the beta-NF-responsive element, two other regulatory regions of the Ya subunit gene have been identified. One region spans nucleotides -867 to -857 and has a DNA sequence with identity to the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 recognition motif found in several liver-specific genes. The second region spans nucleotides -908 to -899 and contains a DNA sequence with identity to the XRE found in the cytochrome P-450 IA1 gene. The XRE sequence also contributes to part of the responsiveness of the Ya subunit gene to planar aromatic compounds. Our data suggest that regulation of gene expression by planar aromatic compounds can be mediated by a DNA sequence that is distinct from the XRE sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Dynemicin is a hybrid containing anthraquinone and enediyne cores, which contribute to binding and cleavage of DNA, respectively. DNA strand scission by the antitumor antibiotic is significantly enhanced by the addition of NADPH or thiol compounds. The preferential cutting site of dynemicin is on the 3' side of purine bases (i.e., 5'-GC, -GT, and -AG) and is clearly different from the cutting sites of esperamicin and calicheamicin. The double-stranded and the stem regions of single-stranded DNAs are preferentially cleaved by dynemicin. Therefore, dynemicin may be a useful reagent for probing secondary structures of DNA. Pretreatment of DNA with Adriamycin and actinomycin D alters the cutting mode of dynemicin. Dynemicin-mediated DNA breakage is strongly inhibited by pretreatment of the DNA with distamycin A and anthramycin, suggesting that dynemicin interacts with the minor groove of the DNA helix. Intercalation of the anthraquinone core into the DNA followed by the attack of the phenyl diradical formed from the enediyne core is considered as a possible mechanism of action of dynemicin.\r"

The expression of this gene is analyzed in mouse embryos that are trisomic in chromosome 16 and are considered to be an animal model for Down syndrome. RNA blot-hybridization analysis and detailed analysis of HMG-14 protein levels indicate that mouse trisomy 16 embryos have approximately 1.5 times more HMG-14 mRNA and protein than their normal littermates, suggesting a direct gene dosage effect. The HMG-14 gene may be an additional marker for the Down syndrome. Chromosomal protein HMG-14 is a nucleosomal binding protein that may confer distinct properties to the chromatin structure of transcriptionally active genes and therefore may be a contributing factor in the etiology of the syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "90251653\r", 
  ".W": "Many hormonal, neurotransmitter, and sensory stimuli trigger the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn releases calcium from intracellular stores. We report here that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release from saponin-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells at 37 degrees C is markedly biphasic, in contrast with nearly monophasic release kinetics at 11 degrees C. Hepatoma, PC-12 neuronal cells, and several other cell types exhibit similar biphasic release at 37 degrees C. The biphasic kinetics are not due to degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or to increased Ca2(+)-ATPase pump activity. Biphasic calcium release was also seen when ATP was quenched to less than 0.4 microM by adding hexokinase and glucose, suggesting that phosphorylation is not involved. External calcium (100 nM-600 nM) range had little influence on the biphasic kinetics. Rapid-mixing experiments revealed that rapid efflux of calcium is followed in approximately 0.5 s by a 30-fold slower efflux. Most striking, successive additions of the same amount of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced short bursts of calcium release of similar size. This retention of responsiveness, which we term increment detection, may be a distinct mode of signal transduction. Like inactivation and adaptation, increment detection gives rise to transient responses to sustained stimuli. Systems exhibiting inactivation, adaptation, and increment detection differ in their responsiveness (none, partial, and full, respectively) to stepwise increases in stimulus intensity. Increment detection could be advantageous in generating receptor-triggered calcium oscillations.\r"

This unusual stability allows formation of the complex before electrophoresis and then separation and detection in the absence of background stain. Competition experiments between the preformed DNA-ethidium homodimer complex and a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA show that approximately one-third of the dye is retained within the original complex independent of the duration of the competition. However, dye-extraction experiments show that these are not covalent complexes. After electrophoretic separation, detection of bands containing 25 pg of DNA was readily achieved in 1-mm thick agarose gels with laser excitation at 488 nm and a scanning confocal fluorescence imaging system. The band intensity was linear with the amount of DNA applied from 0.2 to 1.0 ng per lane and with the number of kilobase pairs (kbp) per band within a lane. Analysis of an aliquot of a polymerase-chain-reaction mixture permitted ready detection of 80 pg of a 1.6-kbp amplified fragment. The use of the ethidium homodimer complex together with laser excitation for DNA detection on gels is at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional fluorescence-based procedures. The homodimer-DNA complex exemplifies a class of fluorescent probes where the intercalation of dye chromophores in DNA forms a stable, highly fluorescent ensemble.\r"

The human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) genes flank the fragile X chromosome site and can be used to monitor integrity of the site in human-hamster somatic cell hybrids deficient in the rodent forms of these activities. After induction of the fragile X site, negative selection for HPRT and positive enrichment for G6PD resulted in 31 independent colonies of HPRT-,G6PD+ phenotype. Southern blot analysis demonstrated the loss of all tested markers proximal to the fragile X site with retention of all tested human Xq28 loci in a majority of the hybrids. In situ hybridization with a human-specific probe demonstrated the translocation of a small amount of human DNA to rodent chromosomes in these hybrids, suggesting chromosome breakage at the fragile X site and the subsequent translocation of Xq28. Southern blot hybridization of hybrid-cell DNA, resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, for human-specific repetitive sequences revealed abundant CpG-islands within Xq28, consistent with its known gene density. The electrophoretic banding patterns of human DNA among the hybrids were remarkably consistent, suggesting that fragile X site breakage is limited to a relatively small region in Xq27-28. These somatic cell hybrids, containing Xq27.3-qter as the sole human DNA, will aid the search for DNA associated with the fragile X site and will augment the high resolution genomic analysis of Xq28, including the identification of candidate genes for genetic-disease loci mapping to this region.\r"

In mammalian skin, the outermost layer, called the stratum corneum (SC), is rate-limiting to water loss. We have evaluated temperature-dependent changes in water vapor permeability and infrared spectra of porcine SC. In particular, we have analyzed the infrared absorption peaks due to the extracellular lipids of the SC. These results show a remarkable correlation between water permeability and the frequency of the C-H stretching vibrations over a broad range of temperature. Since the spectral changes reflect an increased number of alkyl gauche conformers, these results suggest that water permeability is dependent upon the hydrocarbon-chain disorder of SC lipids.\r"

Although the repeating (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n motif that characterizes the triple-helical domain is preserved, type II collagen derived from cartilage of the affected individual contains a population with excessive posttranslational modification, consistent with a disruption in triple-helix structure. The mutation is not carried by either parent, indicating that the phenotype in the affected individual is due to a new dominant mutation. DNA sequence homology in the area of the duplication suggests that the mutation may have arisen by unequal crossover between related sequences, a proposed mechanism in the evolution and diversification of the collagen gene family.\r"

In vivo studies in the rabbit show that inhibition of LDL oxidation slows the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In the present studies, rabbits were fed either a newly developed variant sunflower oil (Trisun 80), containing more than 80% oleic acid and only 8% linoleic acid, or conventional sunflower oil, containing only 20% oleic acid and 67% linoleic acid. LDL isolated from the plasma of animals fed the variant sunflower oil was highly enriched in oleic acid and very low in linoleic acid. These oleate-rich LDL particles were remarkably resistant to oxidative modification. Even after 16-hr exposure to copper-induced oxidation or 24-hr incubation with cultured endothelial cells, macrophage uptake of the LDL was only marginally enhanced. The results suggest that diets sufficiently enriched in oleic acid, in addition to their LDL-lowering effect, may slow the progression of atherosclerosis by generating LDL that is highly resistant to oxidative modification.\r"

  ".W": "The ripening of avocado fruit is associated with the expression of a number of mRNAs concomitant with overt changes in texture and flavor. Two overlapping cDNAs for a mRNA that accumulates during ripening were identified. Sequence analysis of these two cDNAs revealed a polypeptide of 471 amino acids with characteristics of a typical P-450: an N-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor, a conserved heme-binding domain in the C-terminal region, and patches of similarity to various P-450 family members. Further evidence that this polypeptide represents a cytochrome P-450 oxidase comes from the recent isolation and characterization of a cytochrome P-450 from ripe avocado mesocarp [O'Keefe, D. P. & Leto, K. J. (1989) Plant Physiol. 89, 1141-1149]. The N terminus of the predicted polypeptide in the cDNAs is identical to the N terminus of the purified avocado P-450. Gel blot analysis of RNA from fruit at various stages of ripening showed the accumulation of an 1800-nucleotide P-450 mRNA that hybridized to the P-450 cDNA. The P-450 protein predicted by the avocado cDNA sequence shares less than 40% positional identity with any known P-450 gene family. We propose therefore that it be placed in a separate family, P450LXXI, and that the corresponding gene from avocado be named cyp71A1.\r"

  ".W": "An electrophoretically slow albumin variant was detected with a phenotype frequency of about 1:1000 in Sweden and was also found in a family of Scottish descent from Kaikoura, New Zealand, and in five families in Tradate, Italy. Structural study established that the major variant component was arginyl-albumin, in which arginine at the -1 position of the propeptide is still attached to the processed albumin. A minor component with the amino-terminal sequence of proalbumin was also present as 3-6% of the total albumin. After amplification of the gene segment encoding the prepro sequence of albumin, specific hybridization of DNA to an oligonucleotide probe encoding cysteine at position -2 indicated the mutation of arginine at the -2 position to cysteine (-2 Arg----Cys). This produced the propeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Cys-Arg. This was confirmed by sequence analysis after pyridylethylation of the cysteine. This mutation produces an alternate signal peptidase cleavage site in the variant proalbumin precursor of arginyl-albumin giving rise to two possible products, arginyl-albumin and the variant proalbumin. Another plasma from Bremen had an alloalbumin with a previously described substitution (1 Asp----Val), which also affects propeptide cleavage. Hypermutability of two CpG dinucleotides in the codons for the diarginyl sequence may account for the frequency of mutations in the propeptide. Mutation at these two sites results in a series of recurrent proalbumin variants that have arisen independently in diverse populations.\r"

Also, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 is 300 times less active in mediating intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization as compared to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the physiologically active metabolite.

We explored the therapeutic potential of 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 by developing and using the following three leukemia models. (i) Injection of 2.5 x 10(5) myeloid leukemic cells (WEHI 3BD+) into syngeneic BALB/c mice resulted in leukemic death of all diluent-injected mice by day 26. Mice who received the same number of leukemic cells and also received 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.1 micrograms q.o.d., i.p.) had nearly an identical survival curve. Those who received the leukemic cells and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 (1.6 micrograms q.o.d., i.p.) had a significantly (P = 0.003) longer survival, with the last mouse dying of leukemia on day 50. (ii) Injection of 50% fewer leukemic cells (1 x 10(5) cells) into syngeneic BALB/c mice resulted in 86% dead of leukemia at 51 days. Experimental mice who received the same number of leukemic cells and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 (0.8 microgram q.o.d.) had a significantly (P = 0.0006) longer survival than controls; only 53% of the mice were dead by day 100. (iii) After injection of 1.5 x 10(4) leukemic cells, 13% of syngeneic BALB/c mice were free of disease at day 180. In contrast, 43% of mice who received leukemic cells and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 (1.6 micrograms q.o.d.) were still free of disease at day 180. In summary, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 is a vitamin D analog that significantly increased survival of mice who had myeloid leukemia.\r"

One of these is the same size as mRNA for secreted IgA but the other, which is 300-400 base pairs (bp) shorter, does not correlate in size with any form of productive alpha mRNA. Both sizes of transcript were shown to contain germ-line sequences 5' to the alpha switch region, suggesting that the longer transcripts included both germ-line and productive forms of alpha mRNA, whereas the shorter transcripts were only germ-line alpha mRNA. We isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the shorter, 1.3-kilobase (kb), transcript by using an anchored polymerase chain reaction and a specific primer for the constant region. Analyses of these cDNA clones show that the short transcript consists of a 126-bp exon located approximately 1.5 kb 5' to the alpha switch region spliced to the first exon of the alpha constant region locus. Furthermore, a minor fraction of the longer, approximately 1.7 kb, transcripts also contains this exon.

  ".W": "The ability of matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane gel, to induce the differentiation of baby mouse kidney cells has been examined in a hormonally defined serum-free medium. Primary cultures of baby mouse kidney cells were observed to form tubules over a time interval of 1-2 weeks in matrigel. Electron microscopic studies showed that tubules with lumens were present, and the tubule morphology was similar to that of the collecting duct. When using matrigel from which the growth factors had been removed, tubule formation no longer occurred, unless the medium was further supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Transforming growth factor alpha stimulated tubule formation as effectively as epidermal growth factor, whereas transforming growth factor beta had an inhibitory effect on tubule formation. These data suggest that both an extracellular matrix and specific growth factors may regulate kidney differentiation during development.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in transfected cells or epidermal growth factor receptors in human keratinocytes produces 15% to 200% changes in cellular metabolic rates. Changes in cell metabolism were monitored continuously with a previously described silicon-based microphysiometer that detects small changes in extracellular pH. The amplitude and kinetics of the metabolic changes depend upon several factors including pretreatment of the cells prior to receptor stimulation, the dose of hormone/neurotransmitter used, and the receptor complement of the cells. Responses are receptor specific; cells transfected with receptor genes respond only to the appropriate hormone/transmitter, whereas control (nontransfected) cells or cells transfected with different receptors exhibit no response. The specificity of the responses was further documented by using pharmacological antagonists. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human beta 2-adrenergic receptors, isoproterenol produces a 20-60% increase in the rate of extracellular acidification with an EC50 of 4 nM, a response that is competitively antagonized by (-)-propranolol. The EC50 for the isoproterenol response is shifted from 4 nM to 100 nM in the presence of 3 nM (-)-propranolol. The kinetics of the metabolic response induced by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation are markedly slower than those elicited by muscarinic receptor agonists. The maximal metabolic response in cells transfected with beta-adrenergic receptors peaks at approximately 12 min as compared with less than 30 sec in cells transfected with muscarinic receptors, perhaps reflecting activation of different second-messenger pathways. These findings illustrate an alternative means of studying cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters and suggest that metabolic changes will be generally useful for detecting the consequences of receptor-ligand interactions.\r"

The cells show epithelial morphology and express cytokeratin and oncofetal antigens characteristic of pancreatic duct cells. Basal and stimulated levels of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the biophysical properties of single Cl- channels in CFPAC-1 are similar to those of airway and sweat gland primary cultures and Cl(-)-secreting epithelial cell lines. Anion transport and single Cl- channel activity was stimulated by Ca2+ ionophores but not by forskolin, cAMP analogs, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The cells express the CF gene and manifest the most common CF mutation, deletion of three nucleotides resulting in a phenylalanine-508 deletion. These properties have been stable through greater than 80 passages (24 months), suggesting that CFPAC-1 can serve as a continuous cell line that displays the CF defect.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between body fat distribution, as measured by the waist-to-hip circumference ratio, and the 2-year incidences of hypertension and stroke were examined in a cohort of 41,837 women aged 55-69 years. Women who developed hypertension were 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.7-2.6) times more likely to be in the upper tertile of waist-to-hip ratio than those who did not. Adjustment for age, body mass index (kilograms per meter squared), cigarette smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, and education level reduced this odds ratio to 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.3-2.1). Women who developed a stroke were also 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.5-2.9) times more likely to be in the upper tertile of waist-to-hip ratio than those who did not. Adjustment for the same covariates also lowered this odds ratio to 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.4). Further adjustment for hypertension and diabetes mellitus reduced the estimated risk of stroke due to elevated waist-to-hip ratio to 1.3 (95% confidence interval 0.8-2.1). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking remained significantly associated with stroke incidence in the multivariate model. These results indicate that abdominal adiposity, as measured by an increased waist-to-hip ratio, increases the risks of hypertension and stroke, even after accounting for overall body mass. The association of abdominal adiposity with risk of stroke is related, in part, to the association of abdominal adiposity with hypertension and diabetes.\r"

Other independent predictors, in order of significance, were age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, male sex, and current systolic blood pressure. By age 60 years, the risk of having severe carotid atherosclerosis for a person who had smoked for 40 years was approximately 3.5 times that for a never smoker. The major benefit of smoking cessation is in limiting the accumulation of smoking years.\r"

Nausea and/or vomiting were common side effects. Naloxone was discontinued in seven patients (because of hypotension in one, bradycardia and hypotension in two, myoclonus in one, focal seizures in two, and hypertension in one); all seven patients responded to treatment and no permanent sequelae to naloxone were noted. Twelve of the 38 patients showed early neurologic improvement (by completion of the naloxone loading dose). However, there was no correlation between such a loading dose response and clinical outcome at 3 months. Our experience suggests that naloxone is safe at the dose used, but data for efficacy are inconclusive.\r"

Mortality after 30 days was slightly higher in patients with anticoagulant treatment (67%) than in those without (55%), and the proportion of patients who attained moderate or complete recovery was slightly smaller in the treated group (22% and 36%, respectively); neither difference was statistically significant. Volume of the supratentorial hematoma was measured from computed tomograms in 70% of the patients in both groups and was significantly greater in the 55 patients treated with anticoagulants than in the 59 patients not so treated. Volume was not related to the degree of anticoagulation. Based on the total number of patients treated with anticoagulants in the Heerlen region, we conclude that for patients older than 50 years of age the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage during anticoagulant treatment is increased approximately eightfold but is unrelated to the degree of anticoagulation. Our results suggest that intracerebral hemorrhage is more frequent and more extensive in patients treated with anticoagulants but that once it has occurred in such patients intracerebral hemorrhage is not significantly more serious than in untreated patients.\r"

Data were examined using Pearson correlation coefficients and power analyses. All measures were significantly correlated. There was also substantial congruency between the subscales of a measure and its total score. The measures had variable efficiencies; the Barthel Index was the most efficient and therefore required the fewest subjects to identify a significant effect. These data suggest that careful consideration must be given to the choice of stroke outcome measures in terms of their numbers, interrelationships, and statistical properties, as these factors have important implications for the design, analysis, and conduct of clinical stroke studies.\r"

We examined the effects of pulmonary disease and artificial ventilation on the air curve and the calculated cerebral blood flow. We studied the relation between arterial and end-tidal xenon activities in 19 subjects, of whom 15 had pulmonary dysfunction. The t 1/2 of the declining phases of the arterial and air curves were used to express their shapes. The mean +/- SD reference t 1/2 from 15 normal volunteers was 26.8 +/- 8.4 seconds. The mean +/- SD t 1/2 s of the air and arterial curves from the 15 patients with pulmonary dysfunction were 10.4 +/- 2.9 and 33.8 +/- 10.9 seconds. The degree of pulmonary dysfunction (expressed as the pulmonary shunt percentage) correlated with distortion of the air curve. Substituting the arterial for the air curve, mean calculated cerebral blood flow (as the initial slope index) increased from 40 to 61 for the 12 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The degree of underestimation of cerebral blood flow using the air curve correlated with the pulmonary shunt percentage. Our work confirms the problems of estimating cerebral blood flow in subjects with pulmonary dysfunction.\r"

Reversible forebrain ischemia was induced by carotid clamping and exsanguination in 30 anesthetized and artificially ventilated rats. Rectal, skull, and brain temperatures were measured, confirming previous findings that brain temperature falls by 4-5 degrees C during 15 minutes of ischemia unless measures are taken to maintain head temperature by external heating. Temperature gradients developed within the ischemic brain, superficial tissues being cooler than deep ones. These temperature gradients were reversed when skull temperature was maintained at core body (rectal) temperature by external heating. With rectal and skull temperatures maintained at 38 degrees, 37 degrees, 35 degrees, or 33 degrees C, brain temperatures nonetheless decreased by approximately 1 degree C during ischemia. This decrease in brain temperature could be prevented by placing the rat in a Plexiglas box with circulating air at temperatures close to that of the body core and a relative humidity of approximately 100%. We also found that, unless special precautions are taken, a temperature gradient develops between the brain and body core during recirculation.\r"

For comparison, we also examined the thoracic aorta and femoral artery of rats. The cerebral arteries of rats had one distinct internal elastic lamina connected to the thin adventitia with sponge-like medial elastic tissue. This internal elastic lamina had fenestrations, which we found to be less frequent in cerebral arteries than in extracranial arteries, and fold-like protrusions into the lumen. This finding has not been recognized before. Such protrusions were more prominent in cerebral arteries than in extracerebral arteries. At the apical intimal pad, the internal elastic lamina appeared to be continuous, making a honeycomb-like structure. The folds and fenestrations were numerous at the apex. There were no essential differences among species. Our study shows that the internal elastic lamina is not a simple sheet but part of the complicated architecture of the elastic tissue of the vessel wall. These differences in the elastic skeleton, including fenestrations and fold-like structures, in various sites of different arteries may explain the development of various localized vascular diseases.\r"

Blood pressure was adjusted by inflating balloon-tipped catheters placed at the aortic isthmus and root to induce hypertension and hypotension, respectively, 80 minutes apart in each piglet. Cerebral blood flow and concentrations of prostaglandins E and F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 in blood from the sagittal sinus and left subclavian artery were measured 20 minutes before (baseline) and during each blood pressure adjustment. In vehicle-treated piglets, cerebral blood flow was constant at blood pressures between 50 and 90 mm Hg (r = 0.06, p = 0.85). When blood pressure was reduced to less than 50 mm Hg, thromboxane B2 concentration in the sagittal sinus increased by 597 +/- 42% and concentrations of the prostaglandins increased by an average of 308 +/- 45% (p less than 0.05). When blood pressure was raised to greater than 90 mm Hg, concentrations of the prostaglandins increased by an average of 46 +/- 11%, with no change in the concentration of thromboxane B2. Treatment with ibuprofen reduced the baseline concentrations of all prostanoids and prevented their changing during hypotension and hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the other hand, stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats fail to develop stroke even if they are fed the low-K+ version of this diet. Since sympathetic nerves surrounding the cerebral vasculature play an important role in protecting the brain from stroke during hypertension, I studied whether changes in sympathetic nerve density accounted for the differing incidences of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats fed high- and low-K+ diets and in stroke-resistant and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats fed a low-K+ diet. At 14 weeks of age, all 11 stroke-prone rats fed the low-K+ diet had evidence of cerebral hemorrhage while such lesions were virtually absent in the 11 littermates fed the high-K+ diet and totally absent in the eight stroke-resistant rats fed the low-K+ diet. Stroke-prone (regardless of diet) but not stroke-resistant rats exhibited greater sympathetic nerve densities in the left hemisphere than in the right. When stroke-prone rats were compared, in some areas of the cerebrovasculature, rats fed the high-K+ diet had greater mean sympathetic nerve densities than those fed the low-K+ diet. On the other hand, stroke-resistant and stroke-prone rats fed the low-K+ diet exhibited comparable sympathetic nerve densities in most cerebral arteries studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Middle cerebral artery occlusion produced cortical infarcts in the lateral parietal region, with variable involvement of the frontoparietal parasagittal sensorimotor cortex. Within 3 days after occlusion, massive terminal degeneration but no neuronal changes were apparent in the ipsilateral thalamus. By 1 week after occlusion, abnormal neurons with darkly stained, shrunken nuclei and atrophic perikarya were present in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei. These neurons were densely argyrophilic in Fink-Heimer sections. Rats with small lateral parietal cortical lesions had degenerating neurons limited to the medial ventroposteromedial nucleus. Large lesions involving the parasagittal sensorimotor cortex resulted in widespread neuronal damage in the ventroposteromedial, ventroposterolateral, intralaminar, and posterior nuclear regions but nowhere else. Immunoreactivity to laminin antibody decreased, and astrocytic proliferation was abundant in affected thalamic areas. These findings are consistent with retrograde neuronal degeneration due to thalamocortical fiber damage in ischemic cortical regions. Such lesions remote from the infarct may influence functional recovery in patients with stroke.\r"

  ".W": "We measured cerebral blood flow and somatosensory evoked potentials during transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats to compare the effects of four commonly used anesthetic regimens: ketamine/fentanyl/N2O (fentanyl), pentobarbital, ketamine/alpha-chloralose (alpha-chloralose), and ketamine/halothane/N2O (halothane). Six cats in each group were subjected to 60 minutes of left middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Although the amplitude of the initial somatosensory evoked potential wave complex was highest in the alpha-chloralose group (58.6 +/- 16.5 microV) and smallest in the halothane group (27.5 +/- 5.7 microV), amplitude fell by 75% in all groups upon occlusion. Baseline cerebral blood flow varied substantially between groups (e.g., in the right intersylvian gyrus: fentanyl, 96 +/- 12; pentobarbital, 30 +/- 5; alpha-chloralose, 24 +/- 3; and halothane, 76 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g). Occlusion decreased cerebral blood flow to subcortical (e.g., left caudate) structures in all groups (fentanyl, 29 +/- 11%; pentobabital, 45 +/- 12%; alpha-chloralose, 27 +/- 13%; and halothane, 18 +/- 5% of baseline). Postischemic hyperemia occurred in the cortical regions of cats anesthetized with pentobarbital or alpha-chloralose that had reduced cerebral blood flows during occlusion but not in cats anesthetized with fentanyl (cerebral blood flow during occlusion not different from that of cats anesthetized with pentobarbital or alpha-chloralose) or halothane. After 120 minutes of reperfusion, cerebral blood flow had returned to baseline values in all groups. Recovery of cerebral blood flow and somatosensory evoked potential amplitude at that time did not differ among groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the concentrations of carnitine, long-chain acylcoenzyme A, and long-chain acylcarnitine in ischemic myocardium parallel those in ischemic brain. Since carnitine treatment reverses these changes and improves function in ischemic hearts, we examined whether carnitine given to rats before focal cerebral ischemia (produced by tandem right common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery occlusion) alters infarct volume in four separate experiments. Mannitol was used to control for the osmotic effect of carnitine on brain edema in one experiment. While carnitine was found to significantly decrease infarct volume compared with saline in one experiment (p less than 0.05, Student's t test), this result could not be replicated in the subsequent three experiments. Because the positive treatment effect was not reproducible despite similar experimental conditions, the result of the first experiment was attributed to a type I error. Mannitol also showed no significant effect on infarct volume. This study emphasizes the need for concurrent controls with each group of treated animals and the need for replicating the results of a single experiment when testing for drug efficacy in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia.\r"

Mendelian transmission of this major effect was rejected, as was the hypothesis that the major effect is due to a single major locus. Absence of this major effect, leaving only multifactorial effects, was also rejected. Some sources for the non-Mendelian character of the major effect are suggested, such as a combination of two or more Mendelian loci, the presence of phenocopies, sex-dependent differences in the underlying liability model, or heterogeneity in the alcoholism phenotype.

Using a probe for the D22S9 locus, we have examined DNA from eight DGS cell lines and from one balanced-translocation carrier parent of a DGS proband. The D22S9 locus is deleted in four DGS patients, with deletion of 22pter----q11 because of unbalanced translocation. The locus is not deleted from three DGS probands with normal chromosomes or from two DGS probands with interstitial deletions of 22q11. The interstitial deletion DGS probands are also heterozygous for D22S43, another proximal 22q11 locus. This suggests that D22S9 and D22S43 are in a flanking but not critical region for DGS. One of the interstitial deletion DGS probands is monosomic for BCRL2 but has two copies of the flanking BCRL4 and BCR loci. Thus, the region critical to DGS (DGCR) may be in proximity to the BCRL2 locus.\r"

Previous evidence suggesting defects of type II collagen associated with the SEDC phenotype led us to genotype the family for various COL2A1 gene-associated RFLPs. A total of 17 affected and unaffected members of this family were studied. The family was informative for a recently discovered HinfI RFLP. No recombinants between the marker and the phenotype were found in eight informative meioses. A maximum LOD score of 3.01 was obtained at a recombination fraction of .00.

By analyzing 54 unrelated Gaucher patients we show strong linkage disequilibrium between the Pv1.1- genotype and the common Jewish mutation 1226 causing the adult type of this disease. Gaucher disease patients heterozygous for the 1226 allele and one unidentified allele (1226/?), particularly those of Jewish ancestry, were predominantly of the Pv1.1-/PV1.1+ genotype.

We have recently shown that a novel hypervariable locus, DXS255, is very closely linked to the disease gene and is likely to be, at present, the marker closest to the disease gene. The analysis of one family, however, displayed conflicting linkage results, as all of the informative markers situated in the Xp11-q22 region appeared to recombine with the disease locus in two \"phase-known\" meioses. We have shown by X-inactivation studies that the segregation of the disease through three obligate carrier females in this family originates from a grandpaternal mosaicism, which accounts for the apparent recombinations. This shows that germ-line mosaicism can simulate genetic heterogeneity in linkage studies.\r"

This alteration is upstream of the active site (Ser 198), and, if any protein were made, it would represent only 22% of the mature enzyme found in normal serum. Results of analysis of the enzymatic activities in serum agreed with the genotypes inferred from the nucleotide sequence. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis using alpha-naphthyl acetate to detect enzymatic activity showed an absence of cross-reactive material, as expected. One additional individual with a silent phenotype did not show the same frameshift mutation. This was not unexpected, since there must be considerable molecular heterogeneity involved in causes for the silent cholinesterase phenotype. This is the first report of a molecular mechanism underlying the silent phenotype for serum cholinesterase. The analytical approach used was similar to the one we recently employed to identify the mutation that causes the atypical cholinesterase variant.\r"

The Alu element is found on all Y chromosomes and on no X chromosomes, establishing it as part of Y-specific sequences. Distal to the Alu element, sequences from the X and Y are strictly homologous, suggesting that the boundary is formed by an abrupt break in sequence homology. Further investigation of the function of the boundary has been undertaken by examining the population structure of an MspI restriction-site polymorphism (XY274), which is located 274 bp distal to the Alu insertion site. Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrate fixation of the high allele (noncutting or AT base pair) of XY274 on the Y chromosome in most populations, while a full range of high allele frequencies is found on the X chromosomes of different populations. Two exceptions to fixation on the Y chromosome were found in African populations. The level of linkage disequilibrium suggests that the first few hundred base pairs of the pseudoautosomal region on the Y chromosome share a single common origin more recent than the origin of the species.\r"

Many human diseases have been reported to be associated with MHC alleles, haplotypes, or extended haplotypes, but in most cases additional polymorphic markers are needed for the eventual localization of the genes responsible for these diseases. In this study, nine C2 haplotypes for four restriction-site polymorphisms, detected by SstI, BamHI, and TaqI, were defined among 143 unrelated individuals. Two of these polymorphisms are multiallelic and map near the 5' end of the C2 gene. The extensive allelic variation of the C2 gene may prove of value in studies of diseases associated with the MHC.\r"

The polymerase chain reaction was used to selectively amplify a (TTA)n repeat identified in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase gene from genomic DNA of 41 human subjects, and the size of the amplified products was determined by gel electrophoresis. Seven alleles were found that differed in size by integrals of three nucleotides. The allele frequencies ranged from 1.5% to 52%, and the overall heterozygosity index was 62%. The polymorphic TTA repeat was located adjacent to a repetitive sequence of the Alu family. A homology search of human genomic DNA sequences for the trinucleotide TTA (at least five members in length) revealed tandem repeats in six other genes. Three of the six (TTA)n repeats were located adjacent to Alu sequences, and two of the three (in the genes for beta-tubulin and interleukin-1 alpha) were found to be polymorphic in length. Tandemly repetitive sequences found in association with Alu sequences may be frequent sites of length polymorphism that can be used as genetic markers for gene mapping or linkage analysis.\r"

We observed two major biochemical phenotypes. Cells from 40 probands (group A) secreted about half the normal amount of normal type I procollagen and no identifiable abnormal molecules; these patients were generally of normal stature, rarely had bone deformity or dentinogenesis imperfecta, and had blue sclerae. Cells from 74 probands (group B) produced and secreted normal and abnormal type I procollagen molecules; these patients were usually short and had bone deformity and dentinogenesis imperfecta, and many had grey or blue-grey sclerae. In cells from an additional 18 probands (group C) we were unable to identify altered type I procollagen synthesis or structure.

The Hutterite Brethren are an inbred North American population who have three different DNA marker haplotypes of CF chromosomes. Genomic DNA from both a CF child and one parent from each of 10 Hutterite families was analyzed for the presence or absence of the deletion mutation. delta F508 is associated with one of the three CF haplotypes in the Hutterite population, and this is the most common haplotype in a subset of the linkage family data of Kerem et al. The other two Hutterite CF haplotypes are generally rate in Caucasian populations. Since these two CF haplotypes do not carry the deletion mutation, they must carry a different CF mutation(s). The results of the PCR analysis for the deletion mutation lend additional support to our previous conclusion that there were at least three original carriers of CF mutations among the founders of the Hutterite population and that all copies of the same CF haplotype were identical by descent. One Hutterite CF patient has both of the haplotypes which do not carry delta F508. Analysis of this individual's DNA should allow identification of two additional CF mutations in this population.\r"

Affected individuals show symptoms of severe mental and growth retardation that can be prevented by early administration of exogenous thyroid hormone. In this paper, we describe two related Greek families with three children affected by congenital TSH-deficient hypothyroidism. Sequence analysis of the TSH beta-subunit gene (TSHB) showed that the mutation responsible for the hypothyroidism in these families is a nonsense mutation in exon 2. This mutation is a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 94 that destroys the only TaqI site in the TSHB-coding region and gives rise to a novel 8.5-kb TaqI fragment. Restriction analysis showed that the three affected children are homozygous for the 8.5-kb allele and that the four parents and two unaffected children are heterozygous. This mutation gives rise to a truncated peptide which includes only the first 11 of 118 amino acids of the mature TSHB peptide.\r"

This has sometimes led to unrealistic expectations regarding the potential benefits of linkage studies. To investigate how Mendelism may be simulated, we collected data on a common familial behavioral trait, attendance at medical school, among the relatives of 249 preclinical medical students. The \"risk\" of first-degree relatives going to medical school was approximately 61 times that of the general population. Complex segregation analysis carried out under a unified model provided strong evidence of vertical transmission. The results were compatible with transmission of a major effect, and a recessive model provided as satisfactory a fit as a general single-locus model. Moreover, a commonly applied test, allowing the transmission probability parameter (tau 2) to deviate from its Mendelian value, did not give a significant improvement of fit. Only a more general model where all three transmission probabilities (tau 1, tau 2, and tau 3) were unrestricted resulted in a significantly better fit than did the recessive model.\r"

  ".U": "90252791\r", 
  ".W": "Type IV collagen is a major structural component of basement membranes. Four constituent polypeptides have been described and characterized to different degrees. Whereas the primary structure of the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains has been completely established, only short protein sequences have been reported for the recently recognized alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) subunits. We have isolated overlapping human cDNA clones whose derived amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains. However, these clones code for neither alpha 3(IV) nor alpha 4(IV), and thus this new polypeptide has been designated the alpha 5 chain of type IV collagen. To determine whether the gene encoding the alpha 5(IV) chain is syntenic with the contiguously arranged alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) genes at 13q34, the alpha 5(IV) cloned DNA was hybridized to genomic DNA from somatic cell hybrids and to metaphase chromosomes. The results demonstrated that the alpha 5(IV) collagen gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome. Since 14 collagen genes have previously been assigned to nine autosomes, these data represent the first mapping of a collagen gene to the X chromosome. Most important, the alpha 5(IV) gene has been sublocalized to bands Xq22----q23, which are in the same region known to contain the locus for the X-linked form of Alport syndrome. It is therefore possible that this severe dominantly inherited nephritis, manifested by splitting of the glomerular basement membrane, could be caused by mutations in the alpha 5(IV) collagen gene.\r"

  ".W": "Fibroblasts from a man with a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and from his son with perinatal lethal OI (OI type II) produced normal and abnormal type I procollagen molecules. The abnormal molecules synthesized by both cell strains contained one or two pro alpha 1(I) chains in which the glycine at position 550 of the triple-helical domain was substituted by arginine as the result of a G-to-A transition in the first base of the glycine codon. Cells from the mother produced only normal type I procollagen molecules. By allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic sequences from paternal tissues we determined that the mutant allele accounted for approximately 50% of the COL1A1 alleles in fibroblasts, 27% of those in blood, and 37% of those in sperm. These findings demonstrate that the father is mosaic for the potentially lethal mutation and suggest that the OI phenotype is determined by the nature of the mutation and the relative abundance of the normal and mutant alleles in different tissues. Furthermore, the findings make it clear that some individuals with mild to moderate forms of OI are mosaic for mutations that will be lethal in their offspring.\r"

Since, however, it may confidently be assumed some mutations were induced, we have taken the data at face value and calculated the minimal gametic doubling doses of acute radiation for the individual indicators at various probability levels. An effort has also been made to calculate the most probable doubling dose for the indicators combined. The latter value is between 1.7 and 2.2 Sv. It is suggested the appropriate figure for chronic radiation would be between 3.4 and 4.5 Sv. These estimates suggest humans are less sensitive to the genetic effects of radiation than has been assumed on the basis of past extrapolations from experiments with mice.\r"

Two of these probes, p134B and p134C, were isolated from a single cosmid clone (D19S51) and detect the same BglI RFLP; p134C detects an additional RFLP with the enzyme PstI. Analysis of these probes in the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families demonstrates tight linkage with a number of markers known to be proximal to DM. A two-point lod score of 6.34 at theta = .025 demonstrates the linkage of this probe to DM. Analysis of a DM individual previously shown to be recombinant for other tightly linked markers indicates that p134C is distal to DM. This result indicates that both the new probe and the existing group of proximal probes including CKMM and ERCC1 probably flank DM and define the genetic interval into which this mutation maps.\r"

Studies with additional hybrids containing deletions or translocations in chromosome 19 enabled us to localize RYR to 19q13.1 in a region distal to GPI/MAG and proximal to D19S18/DNF11. On the basis that the myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus maps near this region and that myotonia could result from a defect in the ryanodine receptor, we examined the linkage between the DM locus and RYR. Our results, showing several DM-RYR recombinants, rule out an RYR defect as the cause of DM. However, localization of RYR to a region of human chromosome 19 which is syntenic to an area of pig chromosome 6 containing the HAL gene responsible for porcine malignant hyperthermia supports the candidacy of RYR for this disorder.\r"

Codon 717 is in exon 4, so the mutation predicts the synthesis of a truncated receptor that lacks most of its androgen-binding domain. The substitution abolishes a recognition sequence for the restriction endonuclease HaeIII. Amplification of exon 4 by the polymerase chain reaction followed by double digestion with HinfI and HaeIII permits facile recognition of hemizygotes and heterozygous carriers of the mutation.\r"

No significant age, sex, or group effects were observed for autosomal loss (hypodiploidy) or gain (hyperdiploidy). Autosomal loss was inversely correlated with relative chromosome length, but autosomal gain was not. Sex-chromosome gain was significantly more frequent in females than in males, but sex-chromosome loss was not significantly different between the sexes. Significant age effects were observed for both gain and loss of sex chromosomes.

Initial analysis of the alpha globin gene complex (which maps to chromosome band 16p13.3), demonstrated that the alpha thalassemia results from failure of the patient to inherit an alpha globin allele from one of the parents. Using a combined molecular and cytogenetic approach, we have extended this analysis to show that all of these patients have 16p deletions which are variable in extent but limited to the terminal band 16p13.3; in at least four cases the deletion results from unbalanced chromosome translocation, and hence aneuploidy of a second chromosome is also present. The relatively nonspecific clinical phenotype contrasts with the other currently known microdeletion syndromes; this may reflect ascertainment bias in the recognition of such syndromes. This work represents the first step in the characterization of a new microdeletion syndrome that is probably underdiagnosed at present.\r"

Surprisingly, detailed molecular analysis of the alpha globin complex is normal in these subjects. Clinically, they present with a rather uniform constellation of abnormalities, notably severe mental handicap, microcephaly, relative hypertelorism, unusual facies and genital anomalies. Hematologically, their Hb H disease has subtly but distinctly milder properties than the recognized Mendelian forms of the disease. These common features suggest that these five \"nondeletion\" patients have a similar underlying mutation, quite distinct from the 16p13.3 deletion associated with alpha thalassemia and mild to moderate mental retardation described in the accompanying paper. We speculate that the locus of this underlying mutation is not closely linked to the alpha globin complex and may encode a trans-acting factor involved in the normal regulation of alpha globin expression.\r"

In this report, the hypothesis that ABLP is due to rare mutations in the apo B gene was tested. A total of eight ABLP families were studied. Apo B gene RFLPs were used to establish the haplotypes of the apo B alleles in family members. LOD score analysis was used to study the linkage between the apo B alleles and ABLP. These families were categorized arbitrarily as class I, II, III, or IV because of differences in the results derived from both haplotyping and LOD score analysis. In a class I family, affected siblings, who on the basis of the hypothesis would be expected to have the same apo B alleles, had different ones. LOD score analysis of this family gave an infinite negative number at a recombination fraction (theta) of zero. In two class II families, probands who were the result of consanguineous marriages and who, on the basis of the hypothesis, should be homozygotes for a defective apo B allele, were heterozygotes at this locus. The sum of the LOD scores from these two families was -1.7 at theta = 0. In one class III family, a parent was apparently homozygous for a particular apo B allele and yet not affected. This also contributed negatively to the LOD score. In four class IV families, disease inheritance was compatible with segregation of the apo B alleles. This, however, was not statistically significant (LOD score = 0.97 at theta = 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our method (the single-molecule-dilution [SMD] method) relies on the stochastic separation of maternal and paternal alleles at high dilution. The stochasticity of separation and the potential for DNA shearing (which could separate the loci of interest) are two factors that can compromise the results of the experiment. This paper explores the consequences of these two factors and shows that the SMD method can be expected to work very reliably even in the presence of a moderate amount of DNA shearing.\r"

Therefore, we directly sequenced the coding exons of both genes (M1 and Zaug) after PCR amplification. Zaug sequence data analysis showed the presence of the common PI*Z allele-specific mutation (M1 Glu342 GAG to Z Lys342 AAG) surprisingly occurring in an M2 ancestral gene. This is not consistent with the heretofore common finding, by Nukiwa et al. and others, that this mutation is derived from an M1 (Ala213) background gene.

With an estimated 1,000 patients available for analysis, this extensive cluster of families provides a unique opportunity for the definitive localization of the genetic mutation. Linkage analysis between the disease locus in this population and markers within and flanking the HLA region on chromosome 6 were undertaken in 12 families comprising over 100 affected individuals. Despite similarity in the clinical phenotype between those families where the disease locus has been reported to be linked to the HLA locus and the Cuban patients, no evidence of linkage to this region could be demonstrated in the latter. The disease locus was excluded from a 96-cM genetic interval of the short arm of chromosome 6, encompassing the F13A1-HLA-GLO1-MUT/D6S4 loci. These data strongly support the existence of genetic heterogeneity for the disease.\r"

Furthermore, a reciprocal change--i.e., a T----C change in the eighth exon of the CYP21A gene--was observed in the Japanese population and was associated with the two HLA haplotypes, HLA-B44-DRw13 and HLA-Bw46-DRw8.

An insertion of 4 bp of unknown origin is present between the breakpoints in one of the deletions. The second deletion shows a more complex rearrangement, including an inversion at the 5' end. Short regions of homology were found at the breakpoints and flanking the inversion.

Investigation of the molecular basis of HFI is reported here by the identification of two molecular lesions in the aldolase B gene of the HFI individual. Using polymerase chain reaction to specifically amplify exons at this locus and T7 polymerase for the sequence determination of these double-stranded fragments, we show the mutational heterogeneity of the proband. One allele, previously indicated by restriction analysis, was confirmed as A149P (Ala 149 to Pro in exon 5). The other allele was identified as a 4-bp deletion found in exon 4, a deletion which causes a frameshift at codon 118, resulting in a truncated protein of 132 amino acids. Segregation of these mutant alleles in the proband's family was shown by using allele-specific oligodeoxynucleotides to probe blots of amplified DNA. The techniques employed here represent a rapid and efficient method for detection of other mutations in families with this disease. In addition, the ability to detect mutant alleles by allele-specific hybridization offers a new method for definitive diagnosis, a method which avoids a fructose loading or liver-biopsy examination.\r"

With the use of recent technologic advances we determined the effect of delivery on hemostasis in vivo by measuring 11 hemostatic indices simultaneously in 70 healthy pregnant women. Significant increases were found in fibrinopeptide A (p less than 0.001), beta-thromboglobulin (p less than 0.001), and platelet factor 4 (p less than 0.001), suggesting maximum platelet activation and fibrin formation at the time of delivery. In addition to continued clotting activity at 3 hours post partum, increased D-dimer, fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products, and decreased alpha 2-antiplasmin levels suggest maximum fibrinolysis. These changes reflect a peak in hemostatic activity at delivery and in the immediate postpartum period that may predispose the development of deep vein thrombosis.\r"

Similar analyses on either side of 5 mg/dl also revealed no significant relationship. Mean serum magnesium levels in patients with successful tocolysis were statistically similar to those of patients in whom tocolysis failed.

  ".W": "We examined the cardiovascular response at rest and during upright cycle exercise in nine women during pregnancy (25.6 +/- 3.0 weeks' gestation) and at 2 months (8.8 +/- 1.8 weeks) and 7 months (30.0 +/- 2.5 weeks) post partum. Antepartum resting cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume were higher, whereas the arterial-venous oxygen difference was lower than both postpartum values. The antepartum resting oxygen uptake did not differ from 2 months post partum but was higher than at 7 months post partum. Cardiac output during submaximal exercise was greater antepartum than at both postpartum tests. Submaximal antepartum oxygen uptake, heart rate, and stroke volume were generally higher, and the arterial-venous oxygen difference was lower than at 7 months post partum. The slope of the antepartum cardiac output versus oxygen uptake relationship did not differ from the value at 2 months post partum, (6.16 +/- 1.38 and 5.84 +/- 1.34, p greater than 0.05) but was higher than at 7 months post partum (5.22 +/- 0.78, p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in maximal oxygen uptake or heart rate among the three testing periods. Maximal cardiac output and stroke volume were higher antepartum than at 2 and 7 months post partum, whereas the arterial-venous oxygen difference was lower than at 7 months post partum. There were few significant differences in resting, submaximal, or maximal measurements between the two postpartum conditions. These data suggest that the augmented cardiac response to exercise during pregnancy is reduced by 2 months post partum but that additional time may be required for a complete resolution of the cardiovascular changes induced by pregnancy.\r"
