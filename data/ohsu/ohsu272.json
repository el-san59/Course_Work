Arthroscopic biopsy was useful for diagnosis in one case with no light microscopic evidence of crystals in the synovial fluid. Attacks affected 93 sites in 50 patients. Attacks in ten patients occurred after mild trauma, long distance walks, total knee arthroplasty, or intraarticular injection of microcrystalline glucocorticoid. Twenty-five patients had fevers averaging 38 degrees. In five patients the fever was associated with mental confusion. Fourteen patients were initially suspected or misdiagnosed as having septic arthritis. Six patients were treated surgically under this misdiagnosis, with synovectomy complicated by limitation of motion of both knees in one patient. The involvement of more than one joint was noted in 21 patients. Polyarthritis could be an important clue to the diagnosis performed early; the combination of arthrocentesis and injection of microcrystalline glucocorticoid provided excellent therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88165704\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-one patients with significantly limited range of motion of the knee secondary to open surgical procedures were treated by arthroscopic resection of the adhesions and gentle manipulation. The surgical procedures consisted of realignment procedures for patellar dislocation, arthrotomy for meniscectomy and synovectomy, ligamentous reconstruction, open reduction of intraarticular fractures, and prosthetic replacement. The interval between the arthroscopic treatment and the open procedures was from four months to two years. All patients had the arthroscopic releases performed with general or spinal anesthesia, were kept in the hospital for a minimum of three days, and were placed on a continuous passive motion machine. After discharge, an intensive rehabilitation program was instituted under the supervision of a physical therapist. With a follow-up period ranging from six months to two years, marked improvement of range of motion was obtained in most patients. Preoperative flexion was between 40 degrees and 50 degrees in 13 patients, 30 degrees in two patients, 60 degrees in four patients, 80 degrees in one patient, and 10 degrees in only one patient. The final flexion was between 120 degrees and 140 degrees in 12 patients. The remaining patients had postoperative flexion between 85 degrees and 100 degrees. One patient with 10 degrees of range of motion did not improve. Six of the eight patients with an extension lag preoperatively regained full or almost full extension after arthroscopic debridement. Morbidity was low and no serious complications were encountered. This study suggests that arthroscopic intraarticular release of adhesions is efficacious in the management of arthrofibrosis of the knee subsequent to previous open operative procedures.\r"

One tibial component migrated continuously during the period studied, while the remaining prostheses migrated mostly during the first six months. The direction of the migration was erratic. Inducible displacement ranging from 0.8 to 5.0 mm was found in all cases. Clinically, all of the patients were scored as successful although one with continuous migration had the lowest score. This degree of micromotion is compatible with good results after two years, and appears to be a characteristic of the immediate interlocking fixation used in the Freeman-Samuelson prosthesis.\r"

The ability to walk long distances decreased in eight cases and pain increased in seven; two prostheses were loosened and displaced. Because of the poor results of nonoperative management, internal fixation of these fractures is recommended in selected cases.\r"

CAs have been used in medical applications, but with adverse effects, including excessive inflammatory reaction and neural toxicity. Isobutyl CA (ICA) appears more biocompatible, with a long half-life that may be ideal for a soft tissue adhesive. The rabbit Achilles tendon was chosen to test (ICA), and a special muscle-freezing clamp to test this model was designed. The tendons were sharply cut 2 cm proximal to their insertion and repaired in four groups. They were tested to failure on an Instron machine. The breaking strength of the repairs was then noted. Also, the breaking strength of several suture materials was tested. Four Achilles tendon repair groups were evaluated: ICA alone 9.03 newtons (NTS); 4-0 silk Kessler stitch, mean 12.9 NTS; Kessler stitch plus three simple stitches, mean 23.0 NTS; and a combination of (a) and (c)--i.e., suture and adhesive, mean 40.2 NTS. The intact Achilles tendon was tested with an average breaking strength of 317 NTS. The muscle-freezing clamp facilitated reasonable testing of this tendon repair. ICA alone exhibits reasonable strength in vitro and in combination with suture provides a stronger initial repair than either suture or adhesive alone.\r"

Electrodiagnostic, histologic, and electron microscopic techniques were used. The amount of nerve fiber damage was assessed using computerized planimetry. The effects of hematoma evacuation were also investigated. Changes consistent with partial denervation, such as prolongation of insertion activity and distal latency, and the presence of positive waves and fibrillations, were present in the blood-injected but not in the control groups. Degenerative nerve fiber changes localized to the area of hematoma were present in the blood-injected group and were significantly higher than those in the control group. Although there was a difference in the amount of nerve damage between the blood-injected and the hematoma-evacuated group (less damage), this difference was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that intraneural extrafascicular hematoma produces electrophysiologic and histologic evidence of axonal degeneration affecting nerve fibers in the vicinity of the hematoma. Early evacuation of the intraneural hematoma appears to slightly reduce the deleterious effects of the lesion.\r"

On the other hand, costs of screening are not inconsequential, and costs involved in follow-up procedures are high. Vast numbers of small, nonprogressive curves are discovered and followed. Several questions remain. (1) At what ages should school children be screened? (2) Should boys be screened? (3) What should be the criteria for referral or treatment? (4) What is a reasonable follow-up program? (5) How effective is nonoperative treatment? Careful study of the natural history and treatment of idiopathic scoliosis will help to answer these questions.\r"

Growing rabbits had metal marking sutures implanted, at measured intervals, along the length of their medial collateral ligament. Separate metal markers were inserted in the epiphysis and metaphysis of the femur and tibia. Changes in marker intervals were measured radiographically after growth. Measurements revealed that growth occurred throughout the length of the ligament, with somewhat greater growth occurring in the distal segment. Total ligament growth was much less than that occurring at the tibial physis (which the ligament crosses). The magnitude of total ligament growth was proportional to the enlargement of the joint itself, as measured by changes in the distance between epiphyseal markers. The most distal suture inserted in the ligament became incorporated in bone and moved rapidly away from the ligament insertion. This rapid displacement of the distal suture was not responsible for enlargement of the ligament itself, but rather a phenomenon of the maintenance of the position of the ligament insertion on the proximal metaphysis, as the epiphysis grows away from the original site of ligament insertion.\r"

The legs of the animals in the immobilized group had muscle weakness and the animals only occasionally used their legs for the next three to four weeks. The animals in the mobilized group protected the leg for only one to two days after surgery, and by ten to 12 days were actively moving the knee. Severe patellofemoral articular cartilage erosions occurred in the immobilized goats but not in the mobilized group.

No controlled studies on this modality have been reported and few animal studies were found. The efficacy of therapeutic doses of 32P as a medical synovectomy and its effect on rabbit joints with antigen-induced arthritis were observed in 62 arthritic knee joints in 31 adult rabbits treated on one side with 0.1 microCi of 32P, the opposite serving as control. The animals were observed over a period of 11 months and examined by histologic and biochemical means. The synovium showed no evidence of radiation necrosis in treated joints. Cartilage of treated and control joints showed similar changes consistent with chronic arthritis, persistent synovitis, progressive chondrocyte degeneration, and decreased matrix metachromasia. The radiosynovectomy had neither removed synovium nor protected the cartilage. Its efficacy in humans is therefore questionable.\r"

The DBUN generally passed between the abductor digiti minimi and the flexor digiti minimi, and then through the interval between superficial and deep layers of the opponens digiti minimi on its course to the deep palm. Innervation of the hypothenar muscles was by one to four branches of the DBUN. The most common distribution pattern was two major branches, which occurred in 14 (66%) of the specimens. Of these 14 specimens, nine exhibited normal hypothenar muscle anatomy, suggesting a prevalent relationship between three normal muscles and two nerve branches. One main branch occurred in four (19%) specimens, three branches occurred in two (9%) specimens, and four branches occurred in one (4%) specimen. Anatomic variations in the hypothenar muscles were significant, the most notable being the absence of flexor digiti minimi in eight (38%) of the specimens.\r"

Coalescence of fissures and undermining of cartilage fragments were noted at 8000 cycles. With greater loads, the same sequence of events occurred with fewer cycles except that primary fissures appeared before the surface was abraided.

The deeper layers of cartilage appear to be of prime importance in resisting fissure formation.\r"

No major complications because of the instrumentation were encountered. The patients were allowed to sit in a chair on the second or third postoperative day. Early elimination of postoperative casts resulted in an increased rate of problems with fixation and led to reintroduction of a postoperative orthosis, but not the body cast. Some fixation problems may have been related to technical errors and use of the earlier one-button technique. In two patients who had hook dislodgement, the WISSI maintained spinal correction thereby demonstrating its stabilizing effect.\r"

Tibial nerves were unilaterally stimulated, and the potentials were recorded from the midcervical spine with surface and epidural needle electrodes. Over 85% had no significant change in their SEP and no postoperative neurologic deficits. Eleven percent had a significant change in their potential (amplitude decrease of greater than 60% and/or latency increase of greater than 2.5 msec) with no neurologic complications. One patient had a significant potential change and temporary postoperative sensory deficits did occur. One additional patient experienced postoperative neurologic complications but had no SEP change. This single false negative case, however, was clinically significant only for motor dysfunction, which is not monitored by the SEP. When changes in patient core temperature were compared to changes in SEP amplitude and latency, an intraoperative decrease in core temperature increased SEP latency and decreased amplitude, which may explain in part the false positive rate of the procedure.\r"

Preoperatively collected blood met an average of 74 percent of blood needs when it was used alone; in half of the cases it was the only blood the patient required. The combination of preoperatively collected and intraoperative salvaged blood was highly successful, meeting an average of 94 percent of blood needs and supplying all blood needs in 77 percent of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "While studies have evaluated the accuracy of adult patients and health personnel in reading various glucose oxidase impregnated strips to estimate blood glucose, there are no studies exclusively evaluating the accuracy of children with diabetes reading their own strips as compared to a staff member, and meter to meter variability in reading these strips. We evaluated the accuracy of reading chemstrip bG by children at a summer camp. The children's visual readings of their own strips were compared to the visual reading of a single staff member. A total of 356 Chemstrip bG's were visually read by diabetic children and a single trained staff member at a summer camp for diabetics. The strips were then analyzed by two Accu-Chek bG meters. Intermachine variability was found to be negligible over the entire bG range. For the purposes of this study, we define accurate visual readings as those within +/- 15 percent of the meter reading of a given strip. At low bG values (40-79 mg/dl), accuracy by children and staff is low, with underestimating occurring in 39 percent of staff readings and 57 percent of children's readings. At intermediate bG values (120-239 mg/dl) readings are more accurate, especially when read by the staff, with misreadings occurring in only 16-19 percent of the strips. At high bG values (240-399 mg/dl), accuracy by children is decreased, with underestimation 500 percent more often than staff. We conclude that children are less accurate at reading Chemstrip bG than a trained staff member (51% versus 33% misreading), especially at the upper and lower ranges of bG values when visual readings are least accurate, and the need for therapeutic intervention is the greatest.\r"

All patients had a Gram-stained smear of CSF that revealed no organisms. In no instance was a CSF culture positive for a bacterial pathogen. In most instances, cerebrospinal fluid that contains total white cell count and glucose/protein concentrations within limits of normal, Gram-stained smear which reveals no organisms, and a differential cell count with less than 20 percent PMN's is not indicative of risk for bacterial meningitis. If the clinical situation warrants, the majority of children with this profile do not require hospitalization and initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy pending CSF culture results.\r"

Boys were more likely to have been referred for behavioral problems than for academic issues. Girls were seen at an earlier age. Younger children were more likely to have been referred by physicians. While there was a significant association between gender and reason for referral, we found no such relationship between gender and final diagnostic classification. Variables in the utilization of evaluation services are described. Cognizance of these issues should lead to improved provision of care to all children experiencing school dysfunction.\r"

The confusion in diagnosis led to an extensive social service investigation that, in this case, had a positive outcome for the mother's ability to cope. There exists, however, the possibility of iatrogenic-induced emotional stress if child abuse is misdiagnosed.\r"

Gum rosin was a potent sensitizer according to this method as well. The FCAT method was found to be advantageous over the GPMT method in that it is technically simpler to use and a smaller amount of test substance is needed. However, closed challenge was preferred to the prescribed open challenge. The importance of statistical evaluation of the results obtained in predictive testing is stressed.\r"

No single day or combination of two days gave 100% positive results. A single reading on the 4th day gave the highest number of positive reactions at 92%. The prevalence of positive patch tests was significantly higher in patients with surrounding eczema, and in patients with positive patch tests the ulcer duration was significantly longer than in those with negative patch tests. The total number of positive results in individuals increased linearly with the duration of the ulcer. Of allergens to which the ulcer was exposed, the occurrence of multiple sensitivity was significantly greater than predicted from the prevalence of individual sensitivities. However, there was no association between medicaments and metal sensitivity. This, together with the absence of an exponential rise in the number of allergens with the duration of ulcer, does not support the theory of systemic ampliative allergy.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of the aminoglycosides were evaluated in 181 patients admitted to a surgical ICU. Pharmacokinetic parameters changed from 16% to 40% during therapy requiring multiple dosage adjustments and nearly nine drug levels per patient. Dosage adjustments resulted in peak and trough serum concentrations within the therapeutic range 71% and 74% of the time. Aminoglycoside half-life (T1/2) ranged from 1.1 to 69.3 h. Aminoglycoside volume of distribution also varied considerably with an average value of 0.36 L/kg. During therapy most patients gained weight (average 8.4 kg) which correlated with their corresponding fluid gain of 11.6 L. Pharmacokinetic parameters were variable even in patients with a normal serum creatinine. Less than 50% of these patients received the recommended daily dosages. This study suggests that the aminoglycoside volume of distribution in critically ill surgical patients differs from general hospital patients and pharmacokinetic parameters change considerably during therapy. We recommend obtaining timed serum aminoglycoside concentrations early in therapy and adjusting drug dosages as needed to maintain serum concentrations in the therapeutic range.\r"

The animals were kept anesthetized with 75% N2O/25% O2, 0.8% halothane. Hemodynamic and respiratory conditions were allowed to stabilize for one hour preoperatively (baseline data). After surgical trauma (arthroplasty), three 0.5 L of arterial blood samples were withdrawn and replaced with autologous red cells mixed with one liter of 3% dextran-60 in one group 1 (n = 9), one liter of 6% dextran-70 in group 2 (n = 10), and 3 L of Ringer's acetate in group 3 (n = 9). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) was kept at baseline level for a further 10 h with infusion of the respective fluid; for this purpose, groups 1 through 3 needed additional infusions of 0.8 +/- 0.3, 0.5 +/- 0.4, and 5.3 +/- 3 (SD) L, respectively. Group 1 showed the highest jejunal capillary blood flow at 10 h and the lowest intragroup variations in hemodynamic and respiratory data. Group 2 had the highest pulmonary arterial pressures and group 3 had the lowest colloid oncotic and arterial BP and left ventricular volume indices. In group 3, the Hct and serum albumin indicated insufficient plasma volume replacement. This group had a significantly larger (p less than .05) amount of tissue water in skin, skeletal muscle, and jejunum than the other groups; no significant difference in lung or heart muscle water was found between the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the choices on the questionnaire were framed in terms of loss, choice of the risky alternative was associated with greater preference for \"intubation,\" and with longer duration of resuscitation efforts (both p less than .005). At least part of the variation in physician attitudes and practices towards the care of the critically or terminally ill is associated with measurable psychologic differences among individual physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) report greater limitation for activities involving the upper extremities than the lower extremities. Exercise training has generally emphasized lower-extremity exercise. We designed and evaluated two simple, practical, and widely applicable upper-extremity training programs in 45 patients with COPD participating concurrently in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: (1) gravity-resistance (GR) upper-extremity training; (2) modified proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) upper-extremity training; or (3) no upper-extremity training (control). Patients were evaluated before and after at least six weeks of uninterrupted training. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Compared to controls, both GR and PNF patients demonstrated improved performance on tests specific to the training performed (upper-extremity performance test, maximal level and endurance on isokinetic arm cycle). There were no significant changes on isotonic arm cycle, ventilatory muscle endurance, or simulated activities of daily-living tests. Ratings of perceived breathlessness and fatigue decreased significantly in all groups for several tests. We conclude that specific upper-extremity training may be beneficial in the rehabilitation of patients with COPD and warrants further investigation.\r"

Each patient underwent AEM and PES using up to three ventricular extrastimuli. Sixty-three percent (36/57) had coronary disease; and of these, ventricular tachycardia was present during AEM in 64 percent (23/36) and induced by PES in 78 percent (28/36). With the addition of patients with other cardiac diagnoses, the results were 58 percent (33/57) and 60 percent (34/57), respectively. No AEM variable was positively associated with inducible ventricular tachycardia, including frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations, multiformity, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia. Clinical variables positively associated with inducible ventricular tachycardia were coronary disease, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, male sex, and a history of recurrent arrhythmia. Therefore, clinical characteristics are more useful for predicting the results of PES than information derived from AEM.\r"

Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before intervention and five days later. The mean time from onset of symptoms to intervention was 1.92 hours.

Significant improvement from baseline was observed with combined therapy on both the biplane mean ejection fraction (p less than .02) and a calculated wall motion index of regional wall motion abnormalities (p less than .002). The presumed reperfusion rate was significantly higher in group 1 (p less than .03).

We sampled 12 directly visualized airway tumors using standard brush technique. The same brush was then agitated in a SBW vial, which was centrifuged, the cell pellet being smeared over a predetermined area of a slide. Designated areas of each slide were counted and total malignant cells per slide extrapolated. DST slides had significantly fewer cells than SBW slides, and cellular detail was better with SBW in seven cases, DST in one case, and equal in four cases. SBW appears preferable for handling of bronchial brush specimens.\r"

However, when the two drugs were used in combination, intraocular pressure rose in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma but not in patients with open-angle glaucoma or in control subjects. Transient angle closure was seen in five of these patients. Intraocular pressures did not rise when swimming goggles were used to protect the eyes or when antiglaucoma treatment was continued. Nebulized bronchodilator therapy is safe in nonglaucomatous patients and those with open-angle glaucoma. Ocular complications can follow combined ipratropium bromide and salbutamol nebulization in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, but can be prevented by using the drugs separately, protecting the eyes and ensuring continued antiglaucoma measures.\r"

Age, sex, cooperation, and lesion size, location, and depth, as well as needle size, number of passes, and radiographic calculation of total lung capacity all have been implicated in influencing the rate of PTX. Pulmonary function testing to assess PTX risk in PNA has not been previously examined. We retrospectively reviewed 159 patients undergoing PNA who had preprocedure spirometry (PFT) and chest roentgenogram (CXR) interpreted for changes of obstruction or restriction to determine if these classifications could stratify patients at high risk for PTX. We also examined single variables to determine their predictive power. Patients with normal PFT and CXR had a 10 percent risk of PTX, and only one such patient needed intervention to treat the PTX. Obstruction by PFT, regardless of CXR findings, predicted a 50 percent PTX rate. Among single variables, FEV1 proved to be the most significant predictor of PTX. Preprocedure spirometric testing can enhance the assessment of PTX risk and should be routinely performed prior to needle aspiration.\r"

  ".W": "A new bronchoscopic-protected catheter brush (BPCB), designed to obtain uncontaminated bronchial secretions, was studied in vitro and in vivo. The device was composed of a standard biopsy brush, protected by a single catheter and occluded with an agar plug. Ejection of the plug was obtained neither by advancing the brush nor by advancing an inner cannula (as in a telescoping catheter brush), but instead, by an air flux, provided by a syringe which was connected to the proximal tip. In the first part of the study the ability of the BPCB to obtain uncontaminated specimens was tested in comparison with the reference telescoping catheter brush (BFW brush 10/70/90, Medi-Tech Corp Watertown, MA). Catheters of each type were successively passed through the inner channel of a bronchofiberscope which was contaminated with Klebsiella pneumonia. After ejection of the distal plug, sampling of bronchial secretions infected with a marker organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), was performed with the brush. Culture of brush specimens of each type of catheter grew the marker organism in pure culture and obtained the same amount of bronchial secretions (0.001 ml). The manual vortexing of the brush in the transport medium (Ringer's solution) proved to be as effective as the mechanical vortexing so that transecting of the brush was no longer mandatory. In the second part of this study, paired bronchial samplings from 27 patients were performed using both types of catheters and similar results for both were obtained. In these in vitro studies, completed by a clinical trial, our single-sheathed, plugged catheter brush proved to be as reliable as the double telescoping catheter brush. However, because of its relatively simple conception, making it easier to use and lower in cost than the double catheter brush, routine use of this sampling device should be considered.\r"

Proper interpretation of changes in the breathing pattern requires knowledge of the normal variability of the breathing pattern in critically ill, intubated patients. To establish these guidelines, 50 spontaneously breathing patients who were being weaned from mechanical ventilation were monitored with respiratory inductive plethysmography for one hour immediately prior to and following successful extubation. Immediately after extubation, respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation, and mean inspiratory flow increased slightly. By 30 minutes postextubation, these parameters were similar to preextubation values. There was no significant change in variability of f or VT. Although the breathing pattern of these relatively stable, intensive care patients differed from values of normal ambulatory subjects, values were similar in the preextubation and postextubation periods.\r"

The ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) decreased with exercise, and the ratios of maximal exercise ventilation to maximal voluntary ventilation (VE/MVV) were less than 67 percent. These results suggest a cardiac rather than a ventilatory limitation to exercise. Inadequate venous blood return to the heart is the likely mechanism for the impaired exercise performances.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen Chinese subjects with stable asthma were given asymmetric doses of slow-release choline theophyllinate (Theobret) according to body weight; patients under 60 kg (132 lb) received 180 mg at 9 AM and 360 mg at 9 PM for six days (period 1), followed by 180 mg at 1 PM and 360 mg at 9 PM for six days (period 2); for those over 60 kg, the regimen was the same, except that they received 270 mg during the daytime and 540 mg at night. At the end of each period of treatment, concentration of theophylline was measured over 24 hours. Five patients experienced side effects, and two of these were withdrawn from the study. In the remaining 13 patients, optimal concentrations of the drug were attained during most of the 24 hours, and there were only minor pharmacokinetic differences between the two periods of treatment. Compared with observations before treatment, the total symptom score was unchanged, but the peak expiratory flow rate in the morning and evening improved, and the use of inhaled bronchodilator drugs decreased significantly. There was a trend towards progressive improvement as the duration of treatment increased, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of theophylline may lag behind the attainment of optimal concentrations. We conclude that asymmetric dosing regimens of slow-release theophylline are effective and rational in maintenance therapy for asthma and that lower total daily dosages may be more appropriate in Chinese patients when compared to those recommended for white subjects.\r"

  ".U": "88166107\r", 
  ".W": "A rise in cardiac output and a fall in arterial oxygen tension are well known side effects of bronchodilator drugs, particularly beta-adrenergic agonists. In recent years, fenoterol (Berotec), an effective beta-adrenergic agonist, has been used at increasing rates in asthmatic subjects, as well as in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The effects of fenoterol on systemic hemodynamics or arterial oxygenation (or both) in patients with COPD have not been investigated; in these individuals, who often have increased sympathetic tone and hypoxemia even at rest, cardiovascular stimulation and a fall in arterial oxygen tension would be particularly undesirable side effects. In 14 patients with COPD (seven without a reversible component of airflow obstruction [group 1]; and seven with a reversible component of airflow obstruction [group 2]), we studied all of the important parameters of oxygen transport before and 60 minutes after administration of fenoterol. Studies were performed at rest and after exercise. At baseline, group 1 showed a faster heart rate, a lower cardiac output, a lower arterial oxygen flow, a wider arteriovenous oxygen content difference (C[a-v]O2), and a higher fraction of oxygen extracted by the tissues from a given arterial oxygen flow. In both groups, all measured parameters, including cardiac output and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) remained statistically unchanged one hour after administration of fenoterol; with exercise, the heart rate, blood pressure, minute ventilation, oxygen consumption, C(a-v)O2, and the percentage of oxygen extracted from arterial oxygen flow, as well as cardiac output and PaO2, increased in all instances; the exercise responses were not affected by the drug. These results suggest that at the time of its maximal effect on the airways (60 minutes), fenoterol has no untoward effect on the oxygen transport system, at rest or during exercise, in patients with COPD with or without a reversible component.\r"

All were receiving continuous oxygen therapy and had CO2 retention. The physiotherapy methods compared were thoracic compression (TC) and positive expiratory pressure (PEP). The mean decrease (+/- SD) in tcPCO2 was the same with both methods, 0.6 +/- 0.4 kPa, but there were interindividual differences. This study indicates that both TC and PEP effectively decrease tcPCO2, although only temporarily in many cases. Continuous tcPCO2 monitoring is a useful clinical method for determining and teaching optimal respiratory therapy.\r"

The patients were aged 14 to 23 years, had all immigrated within one year and were receiving isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis infection without disease. Clinically, all patients experienced generalized seizures, and three sustained moderate metabolic acidosis. All recovered uneventfully. Psychiatric evaluations revealed that two patients had major depression; two, adjustment disorders with depressed mood; and two, no psychiatric illness. The latter two patients and two others ingested an excessive amount of isoniazid immediately following an argument with a family member. Because tuberculosis infection is prevalent in refugees immigrating from Southeast Asia, isoniazid, given for six months to one year as preventive therapy, is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs during the early resettlement period. There may be an increased risk of intentional isoniazid overdosage during preventive therapy of young refugee women.\r"

Mediastinoscopy proved to be the most accurate staging procedure. Tomography was less specific, detecting only advanced mediastinal node involvement, and CT was as sensitive as mediastinoscopy but sensibly less specific. TBNA gave no false positive results but a false negative rate of 25.5 percent. Accurate preoperative staging of mediastinal nodes is mandatory to optimize the resectability rate of lung cancer. Where metastatic involvement of mediastinal nodes was preoperatively documented at more than one level, tumors were invariably unresectable. Mediastinoscopic demonstration of intracapsular metastases at only one level did not preclude complete resection. Before thoracotomy, confirmation of neoplastic spread to mediastinal nodes suggests very low survival rates, especially in patients with incomplete removal of tumors.\r"

On the other hand, the murmur remained constant or decreased in all but one of 104 patients with valvular aortic stenosis, mitral insufficiency, hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, and systolic murmurs of miscellaneous origins (specificity, 99 percent; positive predictive value, 94.7 percent). Catheterization, indirect arterial pressure tracings, and echocardiographic studies indicated that carotid sinus pressure-induced bradycardia was associated with increased left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The carotid sinus pressure-induced increase in the murmur is probably multifactorial: decreased aortic pressure and impedance; increased contractility immediately on sudden slowing of heart rate; further increase in obstruction as the mitral valve systolic anterior movement is enhanced; and delayed vasodilatation maintaining the obstruction even after return of heart rate to precarotid sinus pressure values. An increase in a systolic murmur with carotid sinus pressure is characteristic of HOCM.\r"

Following their tenth clinical experience in bronchoscopic diagnosis, performance of both experimental and control subjects was objectively evaluated using a Visual Discrimination Test (VDT) that contained six videotaped sequences in suspected cancer patients. Clinical performance was subjectively evaluated by teachers who used a list of Minimum Competency Requirements (MCRs). Experimental subjects provided a significantly greater number of correct answers in the VDT and achieved higher scores for the MCRs that were specifically related to recognition of bronchoscopic anatomy and pathology. This study demonstrated that preclinical training using videotaped programs could improve visual perception and discrimination skills of residents in their bronchoscopic examination of patients with suspected cases of cancer.\r"

The PDU were tested at 0 cm (water seal), -20 cm and -40 cmH2O suction. Compared to water seal, -20 cmH2O suction significantly increased the ability of all four PDU to evacuate air via the chest tube and abolished small differences in chest tube air leak seen among the PDU at water seal. An increase in suction to -40 cmH2O did not significantly alter flow via the chest tube. Previously demonstrated differences among the PDU in handling large air flows were not seen in this lower flow model of bronchopleural fistula. However, because of their higher resistance, use of the Sentinel Seal and of the Thora-Klex was technically impractical even at air leaks of 4 to 5 L/min.\r"

The failure of the IRA procedure was correlated with the preoperative number of rectal polyps and the degree of rectal polyp regression. Spontaneous resolution of rectal polyps occurred in 64 percent of the patients (complete 38 percent, partial 26 percent). In those patients initially having complete resolution, 55 percent redeveloped polyps during follow-up. With a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, seven patients have developed rectal cancer. Rectal cancer development was more common in those patients who had innumerable rectal polyps prior to IRA. Initial polyp regression did not preclude later development of rectal cancer. There were 11 deaths during the follow-up period, but only one of these was from rectal cancer. Abdominal colectomy and IRA is an effective treatment for familial polyposis. Spontaneous regression of polyps occurred in 64 percent of patients, but continuous and complete follow-up is necessary to fulgurate recurrent polyps and to screen for the development of cancer.\r"

A consistent finding was a marked increase in the activities of thymidine kinase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the tumor cells as compared with the adjacent normal mucosa. The activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was not significantly different between tumor and uninvolved colon tissue. Alkaline phosphatase activity was markedly reduced in the tumor specimens.

A wide range was found in the control group. The anorectal angle, pelvic floor descent, and the presence or size of an anterior rectocele did not discriminate between the control and patient groups. Internal intussusception was rare. Among constipated patients, the only significant differences from normal were in the time taken to expel barium and the amount of barium remaining in the distal rectum. The majority of control subjects (15 of 20) evacuated most of the barium within 20 seconds whereas 45 of 58 constipated patients took a longer time. Using the area of barium on a lateral view of the rectum as a measure, 19 of 20 control subjects evacuated at least 60 percent of the barium from the distal 4 cm of the rectum compared with only 25 of 58 patients. A varying degree of defecatory impairment was thus established among many patients with constipation. The patients were subdivided into those with a normal or abnormal whole gut transit rate as an indication of colonic function, and those who did or did not need to digitally evacuate the rectum as a clinical manifestation of an anorectal disorder. No obvious differences were found between these subgroups using the parameters measured.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of mucosal inflammation on tissue concentrations of somatostatin, the distribution and concentration of somatostatin in specimens of normal and abnormal (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) ileum and colon were determined by a specific radioimmunoassay. Each tissue specimen obtained at surgery was separated by microdissection into the mucosa-submucosa and the muscularis externa. Immunoreactive somatostatin was acid-extracted from each layer before measurement. Gel chromatography was used to characterize immunoreactive somatostatin measured by radioimmunoassay; somatostatin-28 was the major immunoreactive species measured in human intestine. In normal colon, concentrations of somatostatin were not related to patient age. Concentrations of immunoreactive somatostatin in the mucosa-submucosa of the descending colon were significantly decreased in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's colitis, compared with normal colon. There was no apparent relationship between concentrations of somatostatin and the duration of inflammatory bowel disease. However, somatostatin concentrations appeared to be lower in patients with severe colitis than in patients with minimal colitis. The decrease in mucosal-submucosal concentrations of somatostatin is in agreement with previous morphologic studies, which have suggested diminished populations of endocrine cells in ulcerative colitis. The possible role of somatostatin in the colon suggests that further studies of the alteration of this gut peptide may be useful in understanding a component of the pathophysiology of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

A committee of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons has reviewed the available data and concludes that future assessments of prognosis should be based on a combination of clinical and pathologic prognostic factors, using multivariate statistical techniques for the analysis. Although many important prognostic factors are known, there is much to learn about these and other items before a confident prediction of long-term outcome can be made. An extension of these methods should be possible to assist in prospective clinical decision-making based on clinical and investigational data. Such a system would be of particular value for patients with rectal cancer for whom cost-benefit relationships of alternative treatments can be so controversial. It is concluded that an accepted, standard nomenclature is required to reach both these objectives using large multicenter studies.\r"

One hundred eighty (58 percent) had no spontaneous pain, 87 (28 percent) had moderate pain, and 46 (15 percent) a severe coccygodynia leading to consultation. In four of the latter group, no other sign of depression was found. Seventy-nine percent of the patients with spontaneous pain and 66 percent without spontaneous pain had coccygeal pain evoked by rectal digital examination (RDE). Seventy-one percent of the patients with spontaneous pain and 56 percent without spontaneous pain had paracoccygeal pain evoked by RDE. Among severely depressed patients (Group III), 76 percent had an evoked pain and 80 percent a coccygeal pain--either spontaneous or evoked. In 178 (57 percent), all signs disappeared when treated with various antidepressants in seven visits and within six months. Seven (2 percent) were failures; 44 (14 percent) were lost during follow-up; 84 (27 percent) did not return after the first consultation. After treatment in five patients was stopped, all signs recurred together and disappeared when adapted treatment was administered again. In 120 consecutive patients who had colonic roentgenologic examination and no depressive sign, two had coccygeal and muscular pain at rectal touch. A highly significant correlation was found between the following parameters: evoked pain and depressive status in noncoccygodynic patients, coccygodynia and evoked pain, coccygeal and paracoccygeal muscular pain. Severity of coccygodynia was not correlated with the number of depressive signs. Sex, age, and treatment efficiency were not correlated. The mechanism of depressive pain is discussed. RDE-evoked pain is proposed as an \"objective\" diagnostic sign for masked depression and as a means of evolution control. The frequency of the disease and efficiency of treatment are stressed.\r"

An analysis of these patients' symptoms, signs, and past histories prior to initial colonoscopy were collated by computer in order to provide useful information to help in early identification of patients with polyps and to define specific risk factors in patients with polypoid cancers (71 patients with 79 cancers). This study shows that the 500 patients with colon polyps, with and without cancer, are similar in all parameters measured. Their symptoms correlated poorly with the pathology or location of the polyp. Frequently unrelated symptoms brought the patient to the attention of their private physician. A significant high-risk group of patients identified were those with prior colon polyps and cancer. A positive family history of colon cancer was not common. Barium enema, the most common examination, was performed in 90 percent of patients and was the first test to diagnose polyps in 54 percent. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, only more recently available and performed in 20 percent of the patients, established a diagnosis of polypoid disease 96 percent of the time. This study supports screening for all adults above 40 years of age with flexible sigmoidoscopy and stool occult blood.\r"

This compares to a rate of 7 percent metachronous cancer in patients with a malignancy demonstrated at any time in the past. The highest risk group for recurrence are patients with more than four polyps at initial colonoscopy, with a 59 percent recurrence rate. The following recommendations for follow-up are made: 1) Flexible sigmoidoscopy is adequate yearly follow-up if the original polyps are confined to the rectum and sigmoid. 2) Colonoscopy should be carried out the first year if the original polyps are beyond the rectum and sigmoid, and yearly until the colon is cleared of recurring lesions. 3) Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with cancer before surgery if possible; if not, within six months after resection. 4) Interval six-month examinations are indicated in patients with colon cancer and multiple synchronous polyps until the colon is cleared. 5) Large, sessile polyps resected piecemeal require a three-month follow-up until gone. 6) When the above conditions are met, colonoscopy at three-year intervals is adequate for long-term follow-up of neoplastic polyps to detect and prevent early malignancy.\r"

In group II, in order to eliminate electrode variability, 10 patients were monitored simultaneously with both systems and a common single pH and reference electrode. In group I, significant correlations were found in six reflux parameters measured and in the 24-hr composite score (r greater than or equal to 0.8722). However, in three of the 12 patients, marked discrepancies were noted in the composite score calculated by the stationary and ambulatory recording systems. Small variations in the pH level recorded by different pH electrodes may have accounted for the discrepancies. In group II, where electrode variability was eliminated, a better correlation was noted between all parameters measured (r greater than or equal to 0.991), and no discrepancies were noted between calculated composite scores. We concluded that the stationary and ambulatory recording systems tested are comparable in measuring 24-hr esophageal pH.\r"

In contrast, solid-phase emptying is controlled in part by antral peristalsis and is, therefore, a more precise indicator of gastric motility. We developed a semisolid, radionuclide gastric emptying test using rice cereal and technetium-99m-sulfur colloid to assess antral physiology in infants with vomiting. Computer-programmed mathematical models were used to determine the shape of a line that best fit our emptying data points. Linear, simple exponential [f = 2-(t/t1/2)], and power exponential [f = 2(t/t1/2)beta] patterns of emptying were calculated, where f is the fraction of the meal remaining in the stomach at time t, and t1/2 is the time when 50% of the meal has emptied and is a determinant of the shape of the curve. In infants with simple regurgitation (chalasia) and those with vomiting and failure to gain weight, we made statistical comparisons between gastric emptying patterns after analysis of the mean percentage of retained radionuclide at 120 min, calculated t1/2, and area under the curve. The coefficient of determination, R2, was calculated as an index of whether a curve provided goodness of fit to the data. Differences between groups of patients were statistically significant for all parameters of each mathematical model. However, higher coefficients of determination were noted in the power exponential model. The data suggest that the power exponential mathematical model provides the best analysis of the gastric emptying patterns for infants with chalasia and those with vomiting and failure to gain weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of stigmata of recent hemorrhage in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. Of 193 patients suffering from peptic ulcer bleeding identified by emergency gastrointestinoscopy, 52 patients were found to have bleeding gastric ulcer (spurt 5, active oozing 9, fresh clot 11, black clot 17, protruding vessel 4, and clear base without stigmata 6); the other 141 had bleeding duodenal ulcer (spurt 5, active oozing 26, fresh clot 43, black clot 23, protruding vessel 15, and clear base without stigmata 31). Patient with continuous bleeding or rebleeding was grouped as unstable bleeders. The rate of unstable bleeders was 39.1% (continuous bleeding 23.9% and rebleeding 15.2%) in patients with gastric ulcer, compared to 9.0% (4.5% and 4.5%) in duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.001). The unstable bleeder rate of ulcers with spurt, active oozing, clot, and protruding vessel was 80%, 44%, 35.7%, and 0%, respectively, in patients with bleeding gastric ulcer; and 33.3%, 19.2%, 6%, and 0%, respectively, in patients with bleeding duodenal ulcer. The data suggest that the stigmata of recent hemorrhage, excluding protruding vessel, has prognostic significance in bleeding gastric ulcer but less in bleeding duodenal ulcer.\r"

Gastric pH was held constant (pH 5.5) by intragastric titration. Glucagon infusion inhibited gastric acid secretion significantly, from 19.6 +/- 1.5 mmol H+ per hour during saline, to 10.4 +/- 1.4 mmol H+ per hour. Blood glucose increased during glucagon infusion and remained constant during saline infusion. Serum gastrin concentrations increased significantly by sham feeding, during saline as well as glucagon infusion, and no difference between the gastrin response during saline or glucagon infusion was found. Thus glucagon, in a physiologic dose, reduces vagally mediated acid secretion by a gastrin-independent mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of calcium carbonate (6 g daily) and of aluminum hydroxide (Amphojel, 7.2 g daily) on human gastrointestinal function was examined because these popular antacids have a documented effect on fecal fat, an undocumented association with constipation, and a putative ability to ameliorate cocarcinogenic effects of bile acids and fatty acids on colonic mucosa. Intake-output studies were conducted over periods of three weeks during which time dietary intake was controlled (20 g fiber daily), and the order of treatment (control, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide) was randomized. Neither calcium carbonate nor aluminum hydroxide altered the mean intestinal transit time of eight subjects. Calcium carbonate increased daily output of feces from 106 +/- 30 (SD) to 131 +/- 41 g, of fecal fatty acids from 7.9 +/- 1.4 to 16.8 +/- 5.4 mmol, and of fecal 3 alpha-hydroxy-bile acids from 411 +/- 223 to 769 +/- 505 mumol. Aluminum hydroxide increased daily output of feces to 143 +/- 43 g, of fecal fatty acids to 12.4 +/- 5 mmol, and of fecal bile acids to 735 +/- 592 mumol. Both Ca2+ and Al3+ precipitated deoxycholate when these ions were incubated in vitro. These observations help to explain how these two antacids may lower blood lipids and ameliorate the effects of fecal bile acids and fatty acids on colonic mucosa.\r"

Since our previous study using radioimmunoassay had demonstrated significantly decreased colonic concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis compared to normal colon, we determined the distribution and quantitation of peptide histidine-methionine. Fresh surgical specimens were dissected into mucosal-submucosal and muscularis externa layers prior to acid extraction and specific radioimmunoassay. One immunoreactive species that appeared to coelute with peptide histidine-methionine was separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Mucosal-submucosal concentrations of peptide histidine-methionine were significantly decreased in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, compared to those in normal colon. In normal ileum and colon, linear correlation analysis showed no relationship between patient age and tissue concentrations of peptide histidine-methionine. However, a parallel decrease in molar concentrations of peptide histidine-methionine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis was demonstrated by linear correlation analysis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that peptide histidine-methionine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are colocalized within the same neural structures that have been altered in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases.\r"

The bile acids and conjugated bilirubin in their purified solutions and in the diluted gallbladder biles could be extracted completely with cholestyramine in powder form or tetrahexylammonium chloride (THAC) in chloroform or ethyl acetate. The enzyme was, however, partially precipitated with cholestyramine and denatured by chloroform but not by ethyl acetate. A standard procedure, therefore, includes extraction of the diluted gallbladder bile with THAC in ethyl acetate, followed by determination of the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme by a kinetic method employing phenolphthalein glucuronide as the substrate. The average Vmax of beta-glucuronidase in the 20 normal gallbladder biles was 165 +/- 86 nmol/min/ml (mean +/- SD), a 23.5-fold increase over the activity before extraction. The measured activity represented the true activity of the enzyme in the bile for recovery of activity of the enzyme added to the bile was practically complete.\r"

Forty-three (76.7%) patients were found to be dependent; 26 (46.4%) moderately, and 17 (30.3%) severely. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis were significantly (P less than 0.05) more often found to be dependent than patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Psychiatric morbidity was observed in 42 (75%) of the patients with alcoholic liver disease and 15 (26.7%) of the nonalcoholic cirrhotics. The difference was highly significant (P less than 0.01). The commonest disorders in patients with alcoholic liver disease were neuroses (33.0%), followed by affective disorders (26.8%). It was, however, not possible to ascertain whether psychiatric disorders antedated alcoholism or were secondary to it. Detection of moderate to severe dependence on alcohol and psychiatric morbidity in about three-fourths of the patients with alcoholic liver disease warrants an increased awareness and a multidisciplinary approach for the management of these patients.\r"

Dimethylsulfoxide-acetone-1 N HCl (90:9:1, v/v/v) was used to dissolve gallstone specimens. Intrahepatic calculi were divided into two groups, ie, nine cholesterol stones and 33 brown pigment stones. Cholesterol stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts had a similar composition to those in the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, suggesting a similar pathogenesis wherever formed throughout the biliary tract. Intrahepatic brown pigment stones contained significantly less bilirubin (P less than 0.001) and more cholesterol (P less than 0.05) by chi-square analysis than brown pigment stones found in the extrahepatic bile ducts, suggesting that the site of formation affects stone composition and modifies stone pathogenesis.\r"

We measured BV with attention to these considerations in 19 patients with cirrhosis and reexamined the determinants of vascular volume and the relationship between vascular volume and sodium retention. BV was calculated as plasma volume (determined from extrapolated plasma activity of intravenously injected [131I]+albumin at time 0) divided by (peripheral hematocrit X 0.82). The result was expressed per kilogram \"dry\" body weight, determined by subtracting the mass of ascites (measured by isotope dilution; 1 liter = 1 kg) from the actual body weight of nonedematous patients. Measured and expressed in this way, BV correlated strongly with esophageal variceal size (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05), although not with net portal, right atrial, inferior vena caval, or arterial pressure, and was significantly greater in patients with sodium retention as compared to patients without sodium retention. The principal modifier of vascular volume in cirrhosis is vascular capacity, which is probably mainly determined by the extent of the portasystemic collateral circulation. Increased vascular volume in patients with sodium retention as compared to patients without sodium retention supports the \"overflow\" theory of ascites formation.\r"

Androgen receptors were assayed in nuclei obtained from three separate liver cancer cell lines and from normal adult human liver. Similar concentrations, ranging from 235 to 550 fmol/mg DNA, of nuclear androgen receptors were detected in all tissues. Low percentages of androgen receptors were retained on DNA-cellulose. Although the presence of receptors implies the potential for metabolic effects of androgens in normal and malignant liver, our in vivo studies suggest that castration does not alter significantly the growth of liver cancer xenografts in athymic mice.\r"

Patients were identified by the detection of HBsAg nearly one month before the development of clinical and laboratory features of acute hepatitis (mean 22 +/- 4 days) and they were followed at one- to three-week intervals for 6 +/- 1 months. Each patient lacked antibody to delta virus. During the incubation period, HBV DNA was not detected in serum. At symptomatic onset, all were seropositive for HBV DNA and HBeAg. At peak biochemical disease, three patients had already cleared HBV DNA and five continued to harbor HBeAg. The duration of HBV DNA seropositivity was as short as one week. At the time of biochemical resolution, all patients had cleared HBV DNA, while four of five remained HBeAg-positive. Clearance of HBeAg and HBsAg occurred 4 +/- 2 months after loss of HBV DNA. We conclude that HBV DNA is not detectable in serum during the early incubation period but that it is present at the onset of symptoms. Its duration in serum can be brief and clearance is possible by the peak of aminotransferase activity. HBV DNA usually disappears before HBeAg, and it is invariably lost by the time of biochemical resolution. Its detection in serum coincides with the clinical illness, but it may be missed unless sampling is done early in the clinical course.\r"

In six animals, bipolar electrodes were implanted on the SO, gastric antrum, duodenum, and jejunum. A catheter secured in the gallbladder fundus was used to monitor gallbladder volume. After control studies, truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty were done in each animal. Before vagotomy, the SO exhibited cyclic changes in spike-burst rate, from 2 to 5/min, that were synchronized with corresponding phases of the duodenal MMC cycle. The gallbladder exhibited partial emptying during the second half of the duodenal MMC cycle with refilling during the first half of the next cycle. By two weeks after vagotomy, the MMC-related changes in SO and gallbladder contractile activity were normal. In contrast, vagotomy retarded the increase in SO spike-burst rate and delayed as well as diminished the pronounced gallbladder emptying that normally occurs after a meal. The same effects were observed for changes in SO and gallbladder activity induced by intraduodenal infusion of Isocal. After vagotomy, the SO and gallbladder exhibited exaggerated responses to intravenous infusion of CCK-OP or motilin. We conclude that truncal vagotomy in the opossum does not affect the fasting pattern of SO and gallbladder contractile activity, but it significantly alters the normal postprandial pattern of enhanced SO spike-burst rate and pronounced gallbladder emptying. The precise mechanism(s) whereby vagotomy produces these changes remains to be determined.\r"

Only one brand of piroxicam (Feldene) is currently marketed in the U.S., and the United States Pharmacopeial Convention established an official dissolution requirement for piroxicam in 1985. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the dissolution performance of several internationally available piroxicam products using the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution test for piroxicam capsules. Of 25 brands of piroxicam capsules evaluated, 72 percent of the brands failed to meet the USP requirement, several by a wide margin. Although there is no specific USP dissolution test for tablets, the test for capsules was applied to five different brands of piroxicam tablets, and 80 percent of the tablet brands tested failed to meet the USP requirement. Although comparative bioavailability studies would be required to establish any definitive relationship between dissolution test performance and bioavailability, the failure of most of these products to meet the USP requirement for dissolution indicates formulation differences that could result in altered bioavailability. The substantial differences in dissolution performance observed among the piroxicam oral dosage forms tested have implications concerning the equivalency and standards of multisource products available on the international market, and should be taken into account by health care providers worldwide.\r"

Blood samples for serum gentamicin analysis were taken after the administration of an intravenous loading dose of gentamicin. The results produced by each method were used to predict the peak and trough values measured on day 3 of therapy. Of the three methods studied, Bayesian analysis, using a serum gentamicin concentration drawn four hours after the initial dose, was the least biased and the most precise method for predicting the observed levels. The mean prediction error of the Bayesian analysis method, using the four-hour sample, was -0.03 mg/L for the peak serum concentration and -0.07 mg/L for the trough level on day 3. Using this method the corresponding root mean squared prediction error was 0.60 mg/L and 0.36 mg/L for the peak and trough levels, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) usually includes the repeated administration of intraperitoneal (ip) antibiotics. The initial segment of this study (15 noninfected CAPD patients) examined the ip administration of four structurally different agents that represent the common types of antibiotics prescribed for peritonitis: an aminoglycoside (tobramycin), a glycopeptide (vancomycin), a beta-lactam (cefamandole), and an oxa-beta-lactam (moxalactam). Subsequently, 16 CAPD patients with peritonitis received either vancomycin (30 mg/kg) or cefamandole (1 g) in two liters of dialysate over a six-hour dwell period. Vancomycin and cefamandole were absorbed more rapidly in patients with peritonitis as indicated by a more rapid decline in dialysate concentrations, and higher serum concentrations that occurred earlier than in the noninfected patients. Although a higher percentage of the ip dose of vancomycin and cefamandole was absorbed during peritonitis, peak serum concentrations at the end of the drug administration dwell period were not significantly different. Numerous factors influence the absorption of ip antibiotics, including the dialysate drug concentration, the dwell period, protein binding, distribution volume, and presence or absence of peritonitis.\r"

This extended nonclinical use of the term documentation has resulted in the profession losing sight of a necessary step in the development, justification, and successful implementation of clinical pharmacy services. An instrument that helps to standardize the documentation of a clinical pharmacist's database, patient-care activities, and therapeutic plans is presented. This process, the pharmacist's workup of drug therapy (PWDT), consists of the following six interrelated steps: (1) establish a comprehensive patient-specific database; (2) identify patient-specific, drug-related problems; (3) describe desired therapeutic outcomes; (4) list all therapeutic alternatives that might produce the desired outcomes; (5) select the drug recommendation(s) that most likely will result in the desired outcomes; and (6) establish a plan for therapeutic drug monitoring that documents that desired effects occur and undesired effects are minimized. A formative method of documenting the clinical pharmacist's activities such as the PWDT must be functional on a daily basis in order to generate meaningful summative management reports.\r"

In some, stringent formulary management policies including programs authorizing therapeutic substitution are practiced. Under this concept a drug that has been previously determined to be therapeutically equivalent to a second drug, even though it is not chemically equivalent to the prescribed drug, is automatically dispensed without contacting the prescriber. This study was undertaken to learn the extent and conditions under which therapeutic substitution is being practiced in the HMO setting. A survey was sent to all HMO in the U.S. inquiring into the operation of the pharmacy services. Specific focus was on the operation of the formulary and the policies and procedures being followed. The main goal was to learn how many programs authorize therapeutic substitution, what drugs are allowed, and what procedures are followed once the substitution is made. Of the 481 surveys sent out, 192 (40 percent) usable responses were received. Results indicate that 30.5 percent of HMO pharmacy plans allow therapeutic substitution. These programs were most likely to be of the staff-model or the group-model and least likely to be of the independent practice association type. HMO with an inhouse pharmacy more frequently had policies allowing therapeutic substitution than those using outside pharmacy services.\r"

We report a case of sulfasalazine-associated agranulocytosis that occurred in a 79-year-old woman who had been taking the drug for approximately seven weeks. The patient had discontinued the drug on her own initiative nine days prior to admission. The patient was admitted with complaints of hoarseness, fever, odynophagia, and malaise. The total white blood cell count was 600/mm3 with a differential of 0% neutrophils, 8% bands, 67% lymphocytes, and 25% monocytes; a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed maturation arrest. The patient's peripheral white blood cell count and differential progressively increased over the nine-day hospital course. Upon discharge the white blood cell count was 12,000 cells/mm3 with 66% neutrophils, 8% bands, 16% lymphocytes, and 10% monocytes. Complete blood counts should be performed periodically in patients receiving sulfasalazine, especially during the first two months of therapy. Pharmacists should counsel patients to discontinue the drug and consult their physician immediately if they develop unexplained fever, chills, sore throat, malaise, or other nonspecific illness during the initial two months of treatment.\r"

Of the assays reviewed, 16 percent were performed for inappropriate indications and 98 percent were drawn at correct times. Of 157 assays that should not have resulted in a dosage change, 8 changes were made; of 63 assays that should have resulted in a dosage change, only 23 changes were made. Inappropriate orders for assays cost the hospital +5016 per year. If routine serum lithium assay monitoring is changed to a three-month frequency, the total cost savings would be +16,632 per year. Clinical pharmacists with specialized knowledge of clinical pharmacokinetics should work with physicians and treatment teams in monitoring serum drug assays to ensure appropriateness of assay request, more complete interpretation of results, and proper follow up.\r"

Studies based on prerecorded data, as in most record linkage studies, have all the inherent problems of the data from which they are derived. Sources of threats to the validity of record linkage studies include the completeness of data, the ability to accurately identify and follow the records of individuals through time and place, and the validity of data. This article also describes techniques for evaluating data quality and validity. Postmarketing surveillance could benefit from more attention to identifying and solving the problems associated with record linkage studies.\r"

The difference in PHT levels during menstrual and ovulatory phase in catamenial group was 3.44 +/- 3.25 micrograms/ml as compared with 0.91 +/- 2.03 micrograms/ml in controls. The mean fall during menstrual phase was significant (p less than 0.05) in the catamenial group. There was also rapid though statistically nonsignificant clearance of PHT during menses as compared with the ovulatory period. It is presumed that the fall in plasma PHT levels during menses, though still within therapeutic range, may be responsible for catamenial exacerbation of epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered at baseline, postcontrol period, and posttraining period to 24 drug-refractory subjects with epilepsy participating in a study of sensorimotor electroencephalographic (EEG) normalization feedback training. Results revealed the following. First, subjects exhibited significant baseline deficits in psychosocial, cognitive and motor functioning. Second, certain tests discriminated subjects before training who were subsequently above and below the median in seizure reduction following EEG training. Subjects who showed the greatest seizure reduction performed better on a test of general problem-solving ability but not on other cognitive tests and worse on tests involving strong motor components and were more intact psychosocially. These subjects also took significantly fewer medications in combination than did less successful subjects. Third, improvement on several measures occurred following participation in the study. Cognitive and motor functioning improved only in subjects with the greatest seizure reduction and only after actual training as opposed to control conditions. Psychological functioning, as measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) improved in both outcome groups. MMPI improvement, unlike cognitive improvement, was as likely to occur after control conditions, when seizure reduction had not yet occurred, as after EEG training. Thus, MMPI changes apparently reflected the nonspecific benefits of participation in this study.\r"

Fifteen of the patients with epilepsy, as opposed to two of the controls, had infarcts on their CT scans (p = 0.003 Fisher exact test, two-tailed). In nine of these patients only lacunar infarcts were present. No patient had a history of stroke. We concluded that cerebrovascular disease was the major underlying contributory factor to the development of epilepsy in these patients. Twelve of the 15 patients were aged greater than 60 years, representing 21% of the patients in this age group. There was no difference between the epileptic patients and controls in the presence of clinical features of systemic vascular and cardiac disease. CT scan evidence of cerebral atrophy was as common in the control subjects as in the patients with epilepsy.\r"

With increasing use of computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect cerebral neoplasms, the value of CSF examination has become less certain. The significance of mild CSF abnormalities in patients with a normal CT scan remains unknown. We reviewed the records of 95 patients with adult onset partial epilepsy whose initial evaluation included CSF examination and CT scan. A CSF abnormality not temporally related to convulsive seizure was seen in 24 patients (25%). The CSF study confirmed a clinically suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage in 4 patients. Isolated mild (49-106 mg/dl) increases in CSF protein were seen in 19 patients. Of these 19 patients, 8 had a structural lesion on CT scan. Clinical follow-up of the other 11 patients (mean 5 years) has revealed no evidence of a focal lesion or increasing seizure frequency. This suggests that in an adult population with partial epilepsy routine CSF examination may not be necessary and should be reserved for situations in which there is particular clinical indication.\r"

Mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) salivary P levels in all ovulation-induced cycles were similar to normal cycles and were 294 +/- 31.5 to 499 +/- 75 pg/ml, whereas the corresponding plasma P levels were 24.9 +/- 5.0 to 51.4 +/- 16.6 ng/ml. Paired plasma and salivary P levels correlated significantly in women induced with clomiphene citrate (r = 0.82), follicle-stimulating hormone (r = 0.80), human menopausal gonadotropins (r = 0.78), and in those who became pregnant (r = 0.95). Luteal phase salivary P levels were 1.0% to 1.3% of the corresponding plasma levels in ovulation-induced cycles. These findings indicate that salivary P may be a useful and convenient alternative to plasma P for assessing ovulation.\r"

Luteal phase defect (LPD) was defined as an EMB greater than 2 days out-of-phase when compared with the onset of subsequent menses. Nineteen women (76%) had LPDs ranging from 3 to 7 days. Mean estradiol (E2) on day of hCG/LH was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher (1709 +/- 997) in patients with in-phase EMBs than mean E2 levels in two groups of patients with out-of-phase EMBs (687 +/- 251, 941 +/- 366, respectively). These findings are further evidence of the importance of optimal follicular development to subsequent endometrial maturation.\r"

In the first series, they were given one of four doses of deglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as a 24-hour infusion during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle. In these studies, there were no significant alterations of the length of the luteal phase of the treatment cycle, and there was no decrease in serum progesterone (P) during the infusion. In fact, serum P increased during the infusion. In the second series of studies, five subjects were given a 48-hour infusion of normal saline during the control cycle, and a 48-hour infusion of deglycosylated alpha-intact beta-hCG during the treatment cycle, both being administered during the mid-luteal phase. Treatment did not alter luteal phase duration and, again, increased serum P. It is concluded that deglycosylated preparations of hCG are not clinically useful as luteinizing hormone antagonists, probably because of residual agonist activity.\r"

In addition, the metabolism of [4-14C]pregnenolone and accumulation of [4-14C]P in response to CC and E2 were determined. The authors conclude the following: (1) the dose-dependent inhibition of P and 20 alpha-OHP production by CC in GC was not reproduced by E2, (2) hCG abolished these effects of CC, (3) these inhibitory actions of CC were not associated with altered 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity nor P catabolism indicating that, (4) these actions by CC on the GC occur at some step(s) during steroidogenesis preceding the formation of pregnenolone. These findings may explain, at least in part, the luteal deficiency experienced by women treated with CC, and they also provide a rationale for the use of hCG supplementation during ovulation induction with CC.\r"

In 31 cases, a transient elevation of hCG occurred after complete serum clearance of exogenous hCG, suggesting that the transient increase in hCG was of embryonic origin. In addition, five patients were found to have prolonged clearance of hCG, which was due not to individual variation in clearance, but to a minimal production of hCG by trophoblastic tissue. These data suggest that implantations occurred in 12.1% of our so-called \"nonpregnant\" patients.\r"

  ".U": "88167223\r", 
  ".W": "Intravaginal culture (IVC) is a new technique elaborated by the authors for the fertilization and culture of human oocytes. Its principle consists of fertilization and early development of the eggs in a closed, air-free milieu without the addition of CO2. One to five ovocytes are deposited in a tube completely filled with 3 ml of culture medium less than 1 hour after their recovery, with 10,000 to 20,000 spermatozoa per ml previously prepared. The tube is then hermetically closed and it is placed in the maternal vagina and held by a diaphragm for incubation for 44 to 50 hours. After this time, the content of the tube is examined and embryos are transferred to the uterus. In the first 100 consecutive punctures, 22 clinical pregnancies were obtained: 17 deliveries, 3 spontaneous abortions, and 2 tubal pregnancies. Also, a randomized study comparing IVC to in vitro fertilization (IVF) was done (160 cycles) and no statistically different cleavage, transfer, or pregnancy rate was seen between IVC and IVF. By simplifying the laboratory manipulations, this technique decreases the cost of IVF and permits its standardization and diffusion. It creates a psychologic comfort permitting active participation of the mother in this stage of embryo development. Also, the use of this technique may give greater knowledge of human gamete metabolism and of the physiology of reproduction.\r"

The presence of a potent growth factor(s), termed Sertoli cell secreted growth factor (SCSGF), in hSCCM was confirmed and supports previous observations based on experiments using rat SCCM. Mitogenicity of hSCSGF was demonstrated in cell proliferation assays with the A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma) cell line and in [methyl-3H]-thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) assays with the Swiss 3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblast) cell line. In a dose-dependent manner, hSCSGF stimulated A431 cell growth up to 4-fold over control values (P less than 0.0001) and stimulated thymidine incorporation up to 4.5-fold over control values (P less than 0.0002). Importantly, SCSGF stimulated A431 proliferation 2-fold over control values (P less than 0.0002) in the presence of 5% serum. With the exception of rat SCSGF, human SCSGF is the only growth factor known to stimulate A431 cells. SCSGF also demonstrated epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like activity based upon displacement of EGF from its receptor in a radioreceptor assay. However, SCSGF is not EGF since it is a potent stimulator of A431 cells, whereas EGF is inhibitory. The growth factor was stable to heat, freeze-thaw, acid (pH 3), and trypsin treatment. Furthermore, it did not bind heparin agarose and is thus distinct from the endothelial cell growth factor family. High-pressure liquid chromatography on size exclusion (TSK G2000 SW) columns revealed an approximate size of 8000 daltons. Human SCSGF is a unique growth factor and may play a key role in the regulation of normal spermatogenesis.\r"

Maximal binding of human sperm to the hemizona usually occurred after 4 to 5 hours of coincubation. Sperm from fertile men exhibited significantly higher binding capacity to hemizonae compared with sperm from men who had fertilization failure during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The HZA index is calculated as follows: (bound sperm from subfertile male) divided by (bound sperm from fertile male) X 100. These findings demonstrate that the HZA may be a useful diagnostic tool in male infertility evaluations.\r"

Clinical or laboratory adverse events were reported in 6 (7%) of the omeprazole-treated patients and 11 (13%) of the cimetidine-treated patients (p = NS). An adverse event caused withdrawal of 1 patient on omeprazole (anxiety and depression) and 2 patients on cimetidine (diarrhea and fall in hemoglobin). We conclude that omeprazole (20 mg daily) resulted in a trend toward more rapid ulcer healing compared with a relatively high dose of cimetidine (600 mg b.i.d.), and was preferred by patients for relief of ulcer pain.\r"

In addition, the role of oxyradicals in lesion formation in this model was studied. Intragastric HCl increased gastric mucosal lesion formation in a dose-dependent manner. Even in the absence of intragastric HCl, ischemia followed by retransfusion of shed blood caused histologic mucosal injury in the corpus and antrum. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that prevents oxyradical formation, slightly, but significantly, reduced the gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion but not that induced by ischemia alone. There was no significant difference in the extent of damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion and ischemia alone. We conclude that exogenous acid, ischemia, and oxyradical formation after retransfusion of shed blood are all important interacting factors in the rat hemorrhagic shock model of gastric mucosal injury. Allopurinol, by inhibiting formation of the oxyradical component, significantly protects against the injury.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we investigated the site and nature of the signal responsible for the generation of the gastrocolonic response at the rectosigmoid region. Sixteen healthy subjects participated in this study. Motor activities were recorded with pressure transducers placed in the rectosigmoid colon. Balloon distention of the stomach with 100, 200, or 300 ml of water caused a volume-dependent increase in rectosigmoid motility that was abolished by atropine. To investigate the intestinal phase of the gastrocolonic response, we infused into the duodenum isocaloric (178 kcal) solutions of normal saline, lipid, glucose, or essential amino acids at 1.5 ml/min for 30 min in random order on separate days. Only lipid infusion caused an increase in rectosigmoid pressure and this was accompanied by an elevation of plasma cholecystokinin from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 1.0 fmol/ml. The increase in motility associated with lipid infusion was antagonized (58% +/- 7%) by atropine. To further investigate the possible role of cholecystokinin as a mediator of the gastrocolonic response, we infused cholecystokinin-octapeptide intravenously at doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/kg.h. A significant increase in rectosigmoid motility was observed only at 20 ng/kg.h and this was accompanied by an increase in plasma cholecystokinin levels to 12 +/- 2 fmol/ml, a value threefold greater than that produced by lipid infusion. These studies demonstrate that gastric distention and intestinal lipid are potent stimuli for the generation of the gastrocolonic response involving the rectosigmoid region. The gastric phase can be generated by mechanoreceptors utilizing the cholinergic pathways, whereas the intestinal phase is nutrient-specific, partially atropine-sensitive, and independent of cholecystokinin.\r"

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were compared with normal controls during resting and two anger stressors: criticism of performance on an intelligence test and during a delay of assistance for a diagnostic procedure. At rest patients with irritable bowel syndrome had higher motor and spike potential activity than normal subjects; however, the difference was only significant for spike activity. Anger significantly increased colon motor and spike potential activity in the groups compared with the resting state. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome produced significantly higher motor and spike potential activity when angered. They also reported themselves to be more hostile and appeared angrier than normal controls after the study. However, they did not report themselves to be more anxious or depressed, suggesting that the observed changes in colonic function of both groups were due to anger. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome scored significantly higher than controls on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scales of hypochondriasis, hysteria, and depression, but these personality factors did not significantly influence their anger level before the study. The results are discussed in terms of the role of learning in the colon and the abnormal reinforcement of bowel behavior in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

Purity and suitability of basolateral membrane vesicles for transport studies was confirmed by enzymatic and functional criteria. Orientation of human basolateral membrane vesicles was determined by [3H]ouabain binding studies and was found to be 64% inside-out vesicles and the rest right-side-out vesicles and membrane sheets. Osmolarity studies indicated that the uptake of biotin by these vesicles represents transport into the intravesicular compartment, with little binding to membrane surfaces. The rate of biotin transport was linear for approximately 40 s but decreased thereafter. Transport of biotin was (a) Na+-independent, (b) saturable as a function of concentration, with an apparent KM of 1.1 microM and Vmax of 0.9 pmol/mg protein.15 s, (c) inhibited by structural analogues (desthiobiotin and biotin methyl ester) and related compounds (thioctic acid and thioctic amide), and (d) stimulated by inducing a positive intravesicular electrical potential. These studies are the first to demonstrate the existence of a carrier-mediated transport system for biotin in the basolateral membrane of human intestine.\r"

The precise anatomic mechanism for this increase in surface area, however, has not been explored in detail. We developed methods for rapidly freezing and fixing intestinal segments in situ in the nondistended or distended state. Distention led to a reduction in villus height (309.2 +/- 9.9 to 230.7 +/- 11.8 micron) and a marked increase in the width of intervillus space in both the transverse (50.4 +/- 4.8 to 298.0 +/- 24.8 micron) and longitudinal (15.2 +/- 3.4 to 76.0 +/- 10.6 micron) dimensions. There was, however, no absolute change in total mucosal surface area. The changes in morphology occurred instantaneously, were entirely reversible, and were demonstrated at pressures that occur spontaneously in the mammalian intestine. These studies demonstrate that luminal distention results in marked alterations in intestinal histology that promote increased access of luminal contents to intervillus transport sites in the intestine in vivo. The resulting alterations could lead to an increase in functional rather than absolute absorptive surface area.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in intact animals have shown that intestinal solute absorption may be enhanced with increasing intraluminal volume and flow rate, perhaps because of increases in functional absorptive surface area or perturbation of unstirred layers. We used single-pass perfusions of rat ileum, performed by simultaneously infusing and withdrawing at equal rates, to determine the separate effects of volume and flow rate on solute absorption at pressures between 3.0 and 12.5 cmH2O. Distention enhanced the absorption of passive probes (3H2O, urea), had no effect on the absorption of solutes transported by carrier mechanisms (D-glucose, L-alanine), and led to decreases in the net absorption of sodium and water whenever intraluminal pressure exceeded 10 cmH2O. Increasing flow rate enhanced the absorption of both glucose and 3H2O. However, the effects of increasing flow rate and distention on 3H2O were not additive. In the presence of higher filling volume, faster flow rate led to no further increases in 3H2O absorption; vice versa, at faster flow rate, no further increases in 3H2O absorption were noted when luminal volume was increased. We conclude that increased intraluminal volume enhances the absorption of solutes transported by passive but not carrier-mediated mechanisms, perhaps via augmentation of functional absorptive surface area. Increased flow rate and volume may increase the absorption of passively absorbed probes, in part, by a similar mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The application of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy is rapidly expanding. Because of the tubular configuration of the gastrointestinal tract, endoscopists often deliver laser energy at large angles of incidence. As incident angle affects the fraction of radiation reflected from the tissue surface, we measured the transmittance and reflectance of laser light from in vitro esophagus as a function of incident angle, using integrating sphere and goniometric techniques. At a wavelength of 633 nm and angles of incidence less than 50 degrees, the total transmittance of the esophagus is approximately 25% and the total reflectance is approximately 45%; both are isotropically distributed. At larger angles of incidence, a specularly reflected component becomes evident and the total reflectance increases. The absorbed light per unit area illuminated decreases with increasing angle, because the area illuminated by the laser beam is proportional to the secant of the incident angle. The data suggest that during endoscopic laser procedures the incident laser beam should be directed within 50 degrees of normal for optimal performance and safety.\r"

Random liver samples were assayed by an isoelectric focusing method, with [3H]mibolerone as androgenic radioligand. After 16 wk of oral diethylnitrosamine treatment there was a greater than 20-fold increase in hepatic androgen receptor concentration in female rats (control group 0.3 +/- 0.07 fmol/mg cytosol protein; test group 8.36 +/- 0.96 fmol/mg cytosol protein; p less than 0.001, unpaired Student's t-test). This coincided with, and may be related to, an accelerated development of neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinoma, or both. Male rats showed slower tumor development and no change in androgen receptor concentrations. This model is the first to demonstrate significantly increased androgen sensitivity in experimental hepatic carcinogenesis analogous to increased androgen receptor expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma. It may provide insight into steroid hormone sensitivity in developing tumors, and a means of testing potential therapeutic use of hormonal manipulation in human liver cancer.\r"

In comparison with duodenal bile, cholic acid was increased at the end of the ileum and chenodeoxycholic acid decreased; in addition, bile acid sulfates were increased and bile acid glucuronides were decreased. When ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid that decreases biliary cholesterol saturation and dissolves gallstones, was administered at a dose of 500 mg to each subject, 59% +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM) of this bile acid was excreted within 24 h from the ileostomies. It is apparent from these studies that absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid from the small intestine is slower than previously anticipated and involves the entire small intestine and probably also the colon.\r"

We analyzed 56 sets of common bile duct gallstones collected over a 10-yr period using infrared and atomic absorption spectroscopy and chemical methods. Twenty-four sets (43%) of stones were cholesterol stones containing 85.3% cholesterol, 3.2% pigment, 0.6% phosphate, and 1.3% total calcium. Ten sets (18%) were black pigment stones containing 36.5% pigment, 11.4% cholesterol, 7.6% carbonate, 3.0% phosphate, and 6.2% total calcium. Twenty-two sets (39%) were brown pigment stones containing 52.7% pigment, 16.5% calcium palmitate, 10.1% cholesterol, 0.4% phosphate, and 3.4% total calcium. Most of the 26 stones found at the same time as or within several months after cholecystectomy were either cholesterol (69%) or black pigment (19%). In contrast, the majority (59%) of the 22 common duct stones that were diagnosed greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy were brown pigment stones. In conclusion, brown pigment stones are a distinct type of pigment stone characterized by their content of substantial amounts of calcium palmitate. They comprise a significant proportion of common duct stones in this series of United States patients, particularly of those found greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy.\r"

Endoscopic treatment via the minor papilla in 2 patients with pancreas divisum was not performed. Three patients had subsequent surgery because of complications; one of them died. Seventeen patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis improved, with 15 patients asymptomatic during a follow-up of 2 to 69 months (median, 11). Seven of 10 patients with chronic pain improved, with 6 patients pain-free during a follow-up of 10 to 34 months (median, 11). In 7 patients, pancreatic pseudocysts could be drained endoscopically by positioning an endoprosthesis into the cyst or by performing a cystoduodenostomy. Six patients had concomitant placement of a biliary endoprosthesis to treat common bile duct strictures within the pancreatic head. One of 32 treated patients died as a result of a complication. We consider endoscopic therapy a viable alternative to surgery in select patients with chronic pancreatitis.\r"

Data from a Maryland study demonstrates the barriers to screening for the elderly: they receive sporadic screening, and office-based providers rarely offer this service. A simple protocol for management is suggested to reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to cervical cancer.\r"

Intrinsic causes of pain arise in the vertebral column itself--arthritis, discogenic disorders, trauma, tumors, and infection; in the cervical musculature--myofascial pain syndrome, torticollis, and whiplash; and in the spinal cord from tumors. Differentiation of these causes from extrinsic causes of neck pain will enable the appropriate management protocols to be implemented. Many of these problems can be treated effectively at the primary care level. Guidelines for specialist referral are suggested.\r"

Tissue ACE was assessed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the ACE inhibitor [125I]351A, as a ligand, and serum ACE was measured by a fluorimetric method. Following oral administration of lisinopril (10 mg/kg), serum ACE activity was acutely reduced but recovered gradually over 24 hours. Four hours after lisinopril administration, ACE activity was markedly inhibited in kidney (11% of control level), adrenal (8%), duodenum (8%), and lung (33%; p less than 0.05). In contrast, ACE in testis was little altered by lisinopril (96%). In brain, ACE activity was markedly reduced 4 hours after lisinopril administration in the circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ (16-22%) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (7%; p less than 0.05). In other areas of the brain, including the choroid plexus and caudate putamen, ACE activity was unchanged. Twenty-four hours after administration, ACE activity in peripheral tissues and the circumventricular organs of the brain had only partially recovered toward control levels, as it was still below 50% of control activity levels. These results establish that lisinopril has differential effects on inhibiting ACE in different tissues and suggest that the prolonged tissue ACE inhibition after a single oral dose of lisinopril may reflect targets involved in the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors.\r"

An all possible regressions multiple linear regression analysis was used. For systolic blood pressure change, the level of systolic blood pressure, age, and change in Quetelet index were significant (p less than 0.05) correlates in white men. The level of systolic blood pressure, the level and change of socioeconomic status, change in Quetelet index, and change in cholesterol were significant correlates for white women. The level of Quetelet index was of borderline significance (p less than 0.055) when the other significant variables were included in the model for white women. The change in Quetelet index was the only significant correlate of systolic blood pressure change in blacks. For diastolic blood pressure change, age, change in hematocrit, and change in Quetelet index were significant correlates for white men. Age, level and change of socioeconomic status, level and change of Quetelet index, and change in hematocrit were the significant correlates in white women. In black men, change in Quetelet index and age were significant. In black women, only age was a significant correlate of diastolic blood pressure change. These results indicate that there may be important differences in these correlates between race-sex groups and thus in the mechanism of blood pressure change for different race-sex groups. groups.\r"

Single doses of 5-HT (0.1-80 ng/kg/min) and ketanserin (5-125 ng/kg/min) were administered intra-arterially. The relative alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and 5-HT2 blocking potencies of ketanserin were investigated using intra-arterial infusions of cumulative doses of methoxamine (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 microgram/kg/min), tyramine (0.25, 0.50, and 1.25 microgram/kg/min), and 5-HT (10, 30, and 80 ng/kg/min) together with a low dose (5 ng/kg/min) and a high dose (50 ng/kg/min) of ketanserin. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and intra-arterial blood pressure were recorded semicontinuously. Intra-arterial infusion of 5-HT induced an initial transient vasodilatation, followed by a steady vasodilatation for the low doses of 5-HT (0.1-10 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05). A steady vasoconstriction was only obtained at the highest dose of 5-HT. Ketanserin induced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow from 15 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05) onward. The vasodilatation induced by 5-HT (1 ng/kg/min) was significantly enhanced by ketanserin (125 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), whereas the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT (80 ng/kg/min) was reversed by ketanserin (50 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), thus confirming that 5-HT2 receptors were stimulated by 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (the increase in pulse interval in response to a phenylephrine-induced increase in blood pressure), age, blood pressure, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the variability of blood pressure and heart rate in essential hypertension. Fifty-six subjects were studied before treatment; intra-arterial blood pressure was recorded outside the hospital for 24 hours. Variability was defined (from all beats occurring while subjects were awake) as the standard deviation about the average waking value for mean arterial pressure (MAP) or pulse interval. The correlation (r) between baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and blood pressure variability was -0.47 (p less than 0.0002). Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was the only independent determinant of blood pressure variability on multiple regression analysis. Thirty subjects were restudied after 5 months of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Ambulatory blood pressure was lower during treatment, whereas pulse interval, its variability, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were higher. Blood pressure variability was unchanged. The variability of MAP was inversely correlated with baroreceptor reflex sensitivity before (r = -0.42, p less than 0.02) and during (r = -0.45, p less than 0.02) treatment, but it was unrelated to the average ambulatory MAP or to the variability of pulse interval either before or during beta-blockade. Sixteen subjects whose average waking ambulatory blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg or less were not treated. This group of borderline hypertensive subjects had less variable MAP than did the remaining 40 subjects (12.4 +/- 2.3 [SD] vs 14.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty patients with hypertension had triplicate measurements of blood pressure and heart rate on two occasions, 1 week apart, during placebo treatment. The average difference between the first measurement and the mean of the triplicate measurements was -0.3 mm Hg. The average coefficient of variation for supine and standing, systolic and diastolic blood pressures was 8.4% for the single measurements and 8.0% for the mean of triplicate measurements. The correlations between the first measurements and the mean of triplicate measurements ranged from 0.90 to 0.98 (all p less than 0.01). The average difference between the two visits for all four blood pressure parameters was -0.6 mm Hg for the single measurements and -0.5 mm Hg for the mean of triplicate measurements (all p = NS). These results indicate that 1) blood pressure does not change further after 1 week of placebo treatment, and 2) use of the mean of triplicate measurements of blood pressure and heart rate gives the same result as use of single measurements, and the results are no less variable.\r"

A 51-year-old woman was hospitalized because of increasing motor disability caused by multiple bone and muscle aches with generalized weakness. She was found to have marked hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, increased parathyroid hormone secretion, but normal renal function and blood pressure level. After the identification and removal of a single parathyroid adenoma, the calcium/phosphate metabolism normalized in a relatively short time during which, however, hypertension developed in the absence of any other endocrine or renal dysfunction. A positive, highly significant relationship was observed between the progressive rise in blood pressure and the gradual increase in serum phosphate concentration occurring after the operation, suggesting that, in the hyperparathyroid phase, an underlying trend to hypertension could have been masked by the phosphate depletion, probably through its effects on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle function.\r"

The blood pressure criteria for resistance (potential resistance) were failure to reach and maintain a blood pressure less than 160/95 mm Hg on two separate occasions during at least 1 year of treatment. Confirmed resistance required that during the same period of follow-up, in which at least two antihypertensive agents had been prescribed simultaneously, blood pressure control had not been achieved. Potential resistance during 1 year of treatment was found in 75 patients (4.2%), and confirmed resistance for the same period was found in 52 patients (2.9%). Diastolic resistance was far more common than systolic; the systolic/diastolic resistance was the rarest of all. Of the 52 patients with confirmed resistance for the first year, 33 achieved control in subsequent years. In sum, true resistance as defined by rigorous criteria pertaining to the hypotensive effects of pharmacological intervention in the general population is exceedingly rare.\r"

  ".W": "Invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is becoming the standard of care for management of acute neurologic and neurosurgical patients. As a result of improved fiber-optic technology, a new disposable 4 French fiber-optic transducer-tipped catheter (FTC) has been introduced for facilitating measurement of intracranial pressure. Placement of the FTC can be intraventricular, subarachnoid, subdural, or intraparenchymal. Sensitivity and linearity of each catheter are manufacturer calibrated and not adjustable. Zero or atmospheric balance is done only once before insertion. Because the transducer is the catheter tip, no leveling to an anatomic point is necessary. The system appears to eliminate some of the difficulties inherent in fluid-filled catheter monitoring. In clinical trials, the comparison of FTC with subdural and ventriculostomy waveforms and pressures showed essentially no difference. Pressure recordings tracked well except during transient periods of increased ICP, when FTC showed higher peak pressures. Use of the FTC requires education regarding placement and maintenance techniques. Although staff experience with the catheter can practically eliminate the problem, the FTC catheters need special handling because of potential for fiber breakage.\r"

Comparison is made with coping mechanisms previously identified in adults. Subjects' problem-focused adjustments included the institution of comfort and therapeutic measures, the resumption of preburn style of dress, varied verbal responses to questioning and staring, the redirection of career goals, and adjustments to phobic neurosis. Emotion-focused adjustments included anger, acceptance of limitations, anticipation of ridicule or rejection, decreased focus on physical changes, a sense of loss, boredom with burns and their sequelae, and various defenses such as rationalization, denial, intellectualization, and humor. Identification of specific physical changes and responses permits the nurse to plan interventions and to provide anticipatory guidance accordingly.\r"

The scales used to assess the quality of peripheral pulses, extremity warmth, and capillary refill were (1) those representative of assessment scales used in common nursing practice and (2) more specific scales that attempt to \"quantify\" the qualitative assessment of peripheral perfusion. The more specific set of scales was used by \"trained observers,\" with the bedside nurse using the nurses' scales. Results demonstrated that both sets of scales and observers were accurate in assessing peripheral perfusion as measured by the actual toe temperature. Analyses revealed which scales were better than others, and a method of assessing peripheral perfusion that includes the best components of all scales is suggested.\r"

The prevalence of a fever (temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) was 40%. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of fever were slightly below 50%, and the specificity and positive predictive value of fever was 68% and 66% respectively. Fever was an accurate indicator of x-ray evidence of atelectasis in only 56% of the subjects.

The highest percentages of perceived stress were associated with the factors of unfamiliar surroundings and missing one's spouse. The sample population had high hopefulness scores for the factors of feelings about the future and personal motivation but ambivalent scores associated with future expectancies. Correlation of scale scores revealed no statistical relationship between perceived hope and stress for this sample population. Clinical applications are multiple. Nursing interventions to reduce stress should include an in-depth orientation to the environment and should allow for frequent contact with one's spouse. Denial must be considered as a basis for a high degree of hope perception during the first 7 days after infarction.\r"

Although CCU care is highly technical, it is not exclusively technical. Patients and their families need care that is considerate of the family group. In a case report, the Lazarus stress and coping framework is used to assess, intervene in, and evaluate care given to one family during an admission of a family member to the CCU. Although this framework is individually oriented and is particularly dependent on individual cognition, it proved useful for work with the described family.\r"

The phase II monitored protocol consists of levels 1 through 6 and is designed to be completed within a minimum of six 1-hour sessions. The phase II nonmonitored protocol consists of levels 7 through 12 and is designed to be completed within 12 weeks. The ultimate goal is for each patient to safely progress to a training level that can be maintained safely and effectively by the patient. A total of 192 patients enrolled in our phase II programs have safely completed both components and are in long-term maintenance programs.\r"

No changes in plasma ACTH or cortisol levels were produced by the 5 mg/kg dose. Plasma ACTH levels increased 3-fold with both intermediate and high dosages. Plasma cortisol levels rose 4-fold (P less than 0.05) within 2 days of commencing the high dose schedule and within 3 days with the intermediate dosage. Plasma aldosterone concentrations increased significantly only with the highest dose schedule. Plasma RU 486 levels rose progressively during the 10 days of RU 486 administration and with the highest dose remained elevated for 7 days after it was stopped. Plasma RU 486 levels measured by RIA and high pressure liquid chromatography were comparable. The monodemethylated metabolite of RU 486 changed in parallel to the parent compound. During the high dose of RU 486, there was a 4% increase in body weight, with a reduction in hematocrit and plasma protein concentration. Plasma electrolyte levels and osmolality did not change. We conclude that in dogs a daily RU 486 dose of 5 mg/kg does not alter adrenal function, whereas higher doses (20 and 50 mg/kg) induce increases in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. Despite the blockade of glucocorticoid receptors by RU 486, the presence of isotonic hypervolemia suggests that there was no functional deficiency of cortisol at the renal tubule or it was overshadowed by augmented mineralocorticoid production and action.\r"

Preoperative serum PTH values averaged 116 ng/L (normal, 12-65 ng/L). In 8 patients in whom intraoperative sampling was performed, clearance of PTH-(1-84) was rapid, with virtual disappearance of PTH by 120 min after clamping the vascular pedicle to the adenoma. Analysis of the rate of disappearance of PTH-(1-84) indicated an exponential decay with a half-life of 21 min. Thirteen of 19 patients had serum PTH values less than 1 ng/L within 8 h after parathyroidectomy. Recovery of PTH secretion from the suppressed nonsurgically manipulated parathyroid tissue occurred during the nadir of postoperative hypocalcemia. Serum PTH was greater than 10 ng/L in 16 of 19 patients 30 h after removal of the PTH adenoma. Therefore, the functional recovery of atrophic parathyroid tissue is more rapid than that of other endocrine tissues studied to date.\r"

During DA-1 receptor stimulation systemic hemodynamic function did not change. Fenoldopam resulted in an increase in urine flow rate from 13 +/- 1 (+/- SE) to a peak of 17 +/- 2 mL/min (P less than 0.05) and an increase in renal plasma flow from 344 +/- 39 to 481 +/- 44 mL/min (P less than 0.05). Urinary sodium excretion and fractional excretion of sodium both increased. Urinary sodium excretion rose to a maximum of 0.32 +/- 0.05 compared with a control value of 0.21 +/- 0.03 meq/min (P less than 0.01), while fractional excretion of sodium rose to 2.7 +/- 0.6 compared with a control value of 1.6 +/- 0.1% (P less than 0.05). The glomerular filtration rate did not change. Administration of a predominantly DA-2 antagonist during continuous DA-1 receptor stimulation did not block the fenoldopam-induced natriuresis. The rise in plasma aldosterone concentration after metoclopramide administration was blunted by DA-1 receptor activation [19.2 +/- 2.9 during control compared with 12.7 +/- 1.3 ng/dL (P less than 0.01) during fenoldopam]. No change occurred in serum potassium, plasma cortisol, or PRA. We conclude that selective DA-1 receptor stimulation in man produces sustained natriuresis and inhibition of aldosterone release by direct renal and adrenal effects.\r"

We purified beta-core from crude commercial preparations of hCG (of which beta-core is a major constituent) derived from pregnancy urine and used this purified beta-core material to immunize rabbits. One antiserum (RW25) was particularly useful in that a RIA with purified beta-core as both radioligand and reference preparation had high sensitivity for beta-core detection and low cross-reactivity with other hCG-related molecules and glycoprotein hormones. The cross-reactivities of purified hCG (CR125), hCG beta (CR125), and hCG alpha (CR125) preparations were in each instance less than 3 x 10(-3) (wt/wt). The cross-reactivities of purified pituitary glycoprotein hormones were in each instance less than 2 x 10(-4) (wt/wt). Using the RW25 RIA, virtually all beta-core immunoreactivity in pregnancy urine eluted from Sephadex G-100 in a position coincident with that of purified beta-core. Urine from men and nonpregnant women contained very low levels of beta-core immunoreactivity (less than 6.5 micrograms/L), while urine from pregnant women and patients with testicular cancer or other neoplasms had levels of beta-core immunoreactivity ranging as high as 26,000 micrograms/L. We conclude that the improved specificity of our beta-core RIA will facilitate studies of the physiology and cancer biology of beta-core molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Five hypogonadal men were treated with transdermal testosterone therapy, using a testosterone patch applied to the scrotal skin. Daily application of the patch, which contained 10 mg testosterone, produced an increase in serum testosterone concentrations from a pretreatment value of 45 +/- 12 (+/- SE; 1.5 +/- 0.4) to 436 +/- 80 ng/dL (15.1 +/- 2.8 nmol/L; P less than 0.001) after 4 weeks of treatment. Normal serum testosterone concentrations were achieved in all men after 6-8 weeks of therapy and were maintained during continued long term therapy for 9-12 months with a patch containing 15 mg testosterone. All men reported a subjective increase in libido and sexual function during therapy, and three men preferred it to testosterone injections. The serum testosterone and estradiol levels did not rise above the normal adult male range at any time during therapy. However, elevated serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations occurred during treatment; the pretreatment DHT concentration was 95 +/- 3 ng/dL (3.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L), and it increased to 228 +/- 40 ng/dL (7.8 +/- 1.4 nmol/L) after 4 weeks of treatment and remained elevated thereafter. The individual mean DHT to testosterone ratio increased from a pretreatment value of 0.2 (range, 0.1-0.3) to 0.6 (range, 0.4-0.7) after 2 weeks of therapy and remained high thereafter. Comparison of the serum DHT levels in patients during therapy with those in normal men who had similar testosterone concentrations [531 +/- 62 vs. 566 +/- 72 ng/dL (18.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 19.6 +/- 2.5 nmol/L); P greater than 0.05] revealed that the mean serum DHT concentration was significantly higher in the patients [315 +/- 69 vs. 87 +/- 6 ng/dL (10.8 +/- 2.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 nmol/L); P less than 0.001], as was the mean DHT to testosterone ratio [0.6 (range, 0.25- 1.1) vs. 0.16 (range, 0.09- 0.24); P less than 0.001]. The high serum DHT levels presumably were due to increased metabolism of testosterone to DHT by the 5 alpha-reductase in the scrotal skin. Serum 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide levels were not elevated in the patients. We conclude that transdermal testosterone therapy is an effective long term treatment for hypogonadism in men. It is, however, associated with high serum DHT levels, whose potential long term effects on the prostate and other tissues need to be investigated.\r"

Plasma glucose and insulin responses were determined by measuring plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before and at 30-min intervals for 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose dose. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was estimated by measuring the steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) and insulin (SSPI) concentrations achieved during the last 60 min of a 180-min continuous infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose (insulin suppression test). Under these conditions endogenous insulin secretion was suppressed, and similar SSPI concentrations were achieved in all men; thus, the differences in the resultant SSPG concentrations allowed direct comparison of insulin's ability to stimulate disposal of an identical glucose load in different individuals. The results indicated that the men with hypertension, whether treated or untreated, had significantly elevated plasma glucose (P less than 0.001) and insulin (P less than 0.001) responses to the oral glucose dose compared to the normal men. Mean (+/- SE) SSPG concentrations were also higher (P less than 0.001) in the men with either untreated hypertension [219 +/- 9 mg/dL (12.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/L)] or treated hypertension [211 +/- 18 mg/dL (11.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/L)] than in the normal men [134 +/- 13 mg/dL (7.4 +/- 0.7 mmol/L)]. Since the mean SSPI concentrations were similar in the 3 groups [approximately 70 microU/mL (502 pmol/L)], insulin was less effective in promoting glucose disposal in both groups with hypertension. These results document the fact that patients with hypertension, whether treated or untreated, are insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic compared to a well-matched control group.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the effects of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone on PTH secretion from abnormal parathyroid tissue from seven patients (four adenomas, three hyperplasia). Both estradiol (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/L) and progesterone (10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/L) significantly stimulated PTH secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner during a 3-h period. These results indicate the need for a careful evaluation of serum PTH levels and other parameters of parathyroid function in estrogen- and/or progesterone-treated patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The variability in plasma of total (58%) and free T4 (72%) concentrations was significantly less (P less than 0.01) in the twin pairs than in unrelated men. Half of the variability of T3 (P less than 0.05), TBG (P less than 0.05), and TSH (P less than 0.05) was affected by influences shared by the twin pairs in both monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. The heritability index for variability of the plasma total T4 and free T4 was greater than 28% (P less than 0.05), and it was 25% or less for T3 and TBG. Variation in TBG accounted for less than 20% (P less than 0.001) of the variation in thyroid hormone concentrations. The results indicate that familial factors, which are affected by genetic and/or environmental factors, influence the variation of plasma TBG, TSH, T4, free T4, and T3 concentrations among normal men. Genetic factors influenced the variation in plasma T4 and free T4 levels.\r"

However, it is less clear whether there also is resistance to the distal tubular effect of PTH on calcium reabsorption in these patients. Thus, we examined the effects of endogenous and exogenous PTH on calcium reabsorption in seven patients with PsH before and during treatment with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha OHD3). Eleven patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism served as controls. Before treatment, urinary calcium excretion was comparable in the two groups and did not decrease significantly after PTH infusion in either group. During treatment with 1 alpha OHD3, in contrast, steady state urinary calcium excretion in patients with PsH was much lower than that in patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism at comparable serum calcium concentrations and did not exceed the upper limit of the normal range when PsH patients were normocalcemic. Infusion of PTH into 1 alpha OHD3-treated PsH patients led to a significant reduction in urinary calcium excretion, even though PTH had no effect on their urinary cAMP or phosphate excretion. These findings suggest that the renal resistance to PTH in patients with PsH is confined to its proximal tubular actions and does not include its distal tubular effect on calcium reabsorption, at least during treatment with active vitamin D metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted to investigate the effect of long term therapy with two iodine-containing mouth rinses on thyroid function. Two groups of subjects were treated daily for 6 months with either a 5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPI)-1.5% H2O2 mixture (Perimed) or a 5% PVPI-water mixture. Thyroid function studies, serum iodine concentrations, and urinary iodine excretion were measured before treatment, at 6-week intervals during the 6-month treatment period, and 3 weeks after the last treatment. There was evidence of significant iodine absorption (elevated serum total iodine and inorganic iodide concentrations and urinary iodine excretion) from daily use of both Perimed and the PVPI-water mixture. Serum T3 and T4 concentrations and the free T4 index did not change. There was a small significant rise in serum TSH concentrations during mouth rinse therapy, but all values remained within the normal range. This small increase in serum TSH is a normal adaptive response to the antithyroid effect of increased iodine intake and accounts for the maintenance of normal serum T4 and T3 concentrations. While daily use of these iodine-containing mouth rinses does result in significant iodine absorption, there is no evidence for the development of thyroid dysfunction during a 6-month course of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PDN-21, the carboxyl-terminal flanking peptide encoded by the calcitonin (CT) gene, has been found in plasma of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma and reportedly is cosecreted with CT. To test whether PDN-21 and CT are cosecreted in normal subjects, we developed a RIA for PDN-21 and measured immunoreactive CT and PDN-21 in whole plasma and silica or C18 cartridge extracts of plasma (exCT, exPDN-21) before and after calcium (Ca) infusion (2 mg Ca/kg over 5 min) in nine normal men and nine normal women. Plasma CT and immunoreactive PDN-21 levels were often below the assay detection limits. In contrast, basal exCT and exPDN-21 were detectable in all plasma samples, and the concentrations of both were significantly higher in men than in women [basal exCT (mean +/- SE): men, 4.8 +/- 0.3 ng/L; women, 2.4 +/- 0.3 (P less than 0.001); basal exPDN-21: men, 4.7 +/- 0.3 ng/L; women, 3.3 +/- 0.3 (P less than 0.01)]. Ca infusion sharply increased CT and PDN-21 concentrations in both sexes, but the increments were greatest in men [mean (+/-SE) increment of exCT: men, 37.2 +/- 3.9 ng/L; women, 15.7 +/- 4.3 (P less than 0.002); mean increment of exPDN-21: men, 29.7 +/- 4.7 ng/L; women, 11.0 +/- 3.1 (P less than 0.005)]. The molar concentrations of exCT and exPDN-21 were closely correlated (r = 0.97; P less than 0.001). With our antiserum, the extraction-concentration technique for measurement of PDN-21 had increased sensitivity and decreased nonspecific interference compared to the whole plasma assay. We conclude that CT and PDN-21 are cosecreted from normal thyroid C-cells under the control of extracellular fluid Ca, and that men have greater secretory capacity for both peptides than women. Plasma PDN-21 may serve alternatively to CT as a marker for C-cell activity.\r"

We report clinical and laboratory observations in a mother with autoimmune thyroiditis who gave birth to three children with different forms of thyroid dysfunction. The first child was clinically normal, the second child had transient neonatal hyperthyroidism, and the third child had neonatal hypothyroidism. After the birth of the second child, the mother was found to be biochemically hypothyroid. Long-acting thyroid stimulator and antithyroid microsomal antibodies were detected in her serum. She was treated with L-T4 (0.15 mg/day). After the birth of her third child, the mother was found to have thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins and TSH-blocking inhibitory immunoglobulins in her serum. The latter also were detected in the third newborn. Six weeks later, TSH-blocking inhibitory immunoglobulins were not detected in the child, but they persisted in the mother. This report further expands the spectrum of neonatal thyroid disease and suggests that differing disease syndromes in the newborn can occur depending on whether stimulating or blocking antibodies predominate in the mother.\r"
