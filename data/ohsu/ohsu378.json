  ".W": "We evaluated the efficacy of fatty-meal sonography for identifying patients with partial common duct obstruction. The test consisted of initial control measurements of common duct diameter followed by repeated measurements every 15 min for 60 min after a fatty meal consisting of Lipomul (1.5 ml/lb). The rationale proposed for the fatty-meal test is that in the presence of partial common duct obstruction, fat-induced increases in bile flow related to increased circulating levels of cholecystokinin are associated with an increase in the diameter of the common duct. Initial analysis of our data indicated that a change in diameter of +/- 1 mm was within the range of measurement error or possibly physiologic variation. In 44 control subjects (24 without a gallbladder), the common duct diameter either remained unchanged, showed an insignificant change of +/- 1 mm, or decreased (greater than or equal to 2 mm). The common duct diameter never showed an increase of more than 1 mm. The results of fatty-meal sonography in 47 patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction were negative in all 28 true-negative cases (specificity, 100%) and were positive (common duct increased by greater than or equal to 2 mm) in 14 of 19 true-positive cases (sensitivity, 74%). Thus, in this study a positive test finding always indicated partial common duct obstruction. Of the true-positive cases, fatty-meal sonography correctly identified seven of eight patients with cryptic obstructive sphincter-of-Oddi dysfunction (stenosis or dyskinesia) and five of nine patients with commun duct stones. We conclude that fatty-meal sonography is a useful noninvasive screening test for evaluating patients with suspected partial common duct obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, blinded study of 205 patients, oral cholecystography (OCG) and sonography were compared in terms of how well each screened patients for gallbladder diseases. Among 23 patients who had pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis at cholecystectomy, OCG correctly diagnosed 20 cases (87%) while sonography diagnosed 18 (78%). Among 54 patients with an abnormal OCG and/or sonogram, OCG detected 47 (87%) while sonography detected 44 (81%). These small differences in detection rates were not statistically significant. On the basis of these results, we cannot conclude that either sonography or OCG has a diagnostic advantage in screening patients for gallbladder disease. The large numbers of false-negative examinations found on both sonography and OCG suggest that in a patient with persistent symptoms, the alternative study should be performed if the first examination is negative.\r"

The colon, predominantly the right side, was involved in 17 of the 18 cases. Pneumatosis intestinalis developed earlier in the 14 symptomatic patients than in the four asymptomatic patients. Symptoms included diarrhea (12 patients), abdominal pain (six patients), rectal bleeding (two patients), and abdominal distension (two patients). Factors contributing to the development of pneumatosis intestinalis included pretransplantation chemotherapy and radiotherapy, steroid therapy, infectious colitis, graft-versus-host disease, and septic shock. Intestinal disease contributed to the deaths of seven patients with pneumatosis intestinalis, necessitated right hemicolectomy in another patient, and resolved with conservative treatment in 10 patients. In summary, bone marrow transplant recipients with pneumatosis intestinalis may follow either a benign or fatal course, depending on the underlying condition of the patient. Clinical correlation is important in determining the significance of this finding.\r"

The diagnoses included ovarian cyst (27), endometrioma (12), complex cyst (four), dermoid (three), infection (three), ovarian malignancy (two), and uterine fibroid (three). The final diagnosis was made surgically in 41 patients (61%) and by a combination of sonographic and clinical correlation in the remaining patients. More information about the internal architecture or anatomy of the mass was provided by the transvaginal images than by the transabdominal scans in 51 (76%) of the patients. Transabdominal sonography did not provide more diagnostic information in any of the patients examined. Transvaginal sonography was helpful in obese patients, in those with a large amount of bowel gas, and in those unable to achieve adequate bladder filling. Six simple cysts and four complex pelvic masses were identified solely on transvaginal sonograms. The results suggest that transvaginal sonography has considerable advantages over conventional transabdominal sonography in the evaluation of pelvic masses in women.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for long-term hypertension in children after successful repair of coarctation of the aorta have not yet been determined. We measured plasma renin activity and aldosterone, adrenalin, and noradrenalin concentrations both under basal conditions and in response to standing and treadmill exercise in 24 normal normotensive children, 16 normotensive postcoarctectomy children, eight hypertensive postcoarctectomy children, and seven children with essential hypertension. Exercise-induced changes in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, adrenalin, and noradrenalin were comparable in the four groups in spite of a significantly greater increase in systolic blood pressure in the children with hypertension. In response to standing, the plasma concentration of noradrenalin increased significantly in normotensive but not in hypertensive children. Hyperresponse of blood pressure to exercise in hypertensive postcoarctectomy children and children with essential hypertension is not related to abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system or the angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Hypertension could be related to primary baroreceptor alterations, to structural changes in the arterial wall, or both. Twenty percent of normotensive postcoarctectomy children had a blood pressure hyperresponse to exercise and an abnormal noradrenalin response to standing similar to that seen in the hypertensive children. Follow-up of children after coarctectomy may elucidate whether these two abnormalities are indicators of an increased risk of developing long-term recurrent hypertension.\r"

These patients were randomized, double-blind to placebo or diltiazem (10-mg intravenous bolus followed by 15 mg/hr intravenous infusion during 72 hours, followed by 4 X 60 mg during 21 days). Myocardial infarct size was assessed by plasma creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB indexes, perfusion defect scores using single-photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography. Tomographic and angiographic scanning was performed serially before randomization, after 48 hours and 21 days later. Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, inclusion time and baseline infarct location and size. Results showed no difference in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB data between controls and treated patients, a significant decrease in the perfusion defect scores in the diltiazem group (+0.1 +/- 3.0 placebo vs -2.2 +/- 1.9 diltiazem, p less than 0.02) and a better ejection fraction recovery in the diltiazem group (-4.2 +/- 7.4 placebo vs +7.7 +/- 11.2 diltiazem, p less than 0.05). Myocardial infarct size estimates from perfusion defect scores and enzyme data were closely correlated.

Assessments were made using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and treadmill exercise testing performed 22 to 24 hours after the last dose of medication. Both groups were comparable at the end of the placebo phase. In the bevantolol group, exercise time increased from 7.9 +/- 0.7 minutes with placebo to 9.3 +/- 0.7 minutes with bevantolol (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (p less than 0.05). Time to 1 mm ST depression was unaltered. Rest and exercise heart rate decreased (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.0005, respectively) as did exercise double product (p less than 0.0001). In the atenolol group exercise time increased from 7.1 +/- 0.7 minutes with placebo to 8.2 +/- 0.8 minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.02). Time to 1 mm ST depression increased (p less than 0.005) and rest and exercise heart rate and double product decreased (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.05, respectively). When within-group differences between placebo and active drug were compared for bevantolol and atenolol, no significant differences were detected. Both drugs were well tolerated and reduced ambulatory heart rate throughout the 24 hours. This study confirms that both bevantolol and atenolol are effective antianginal agents. Bevantolol compares well with atenolol in the treatment of patients with chronic angina, and there was a similar response to exercise testing with the 2 drugs.\r"

After 2 weeks of single-blind placebo therapy and a 12-week parallel placebo-controlled, dose-response study, each patient received open-label bepridil. After a dose-titration period of 3 months, patients received bepridil (100 to 400 mg once a day, mean 290 mg) for 24 months. The response to treatment was assessed by patient diaries and serial treadmill exercise testing 24 hours after dose administration, every 3 months. Only 2 patients were released from the study due to therapeutic failure. Compared with placebo, 3 months of bepridil therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the weekly frequency of angina from 10.3 +/- 9.1 to 1.8 +/- 3.5 (p less than 0.002) and nitroglycerin consumption from 5.0 +/- 5.4 to 1.4 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.01).

These favorable effects were sustained throughout the 24 months of the study. Although resting QTc interval was prolonged by 36 to 42 ms (p less than 0.001) during bepridil therapy, ventricular dysrhythmias were not observed immediately before or during exercise testing and were not manifested by symptoms.

After routine endomyocardial biopsy, right-sided heart pressures and thermodilution cardiac outputs were measured at rest (supine) and during symptom-limited, graded supine exercise. In addition, the effect of respiration on right atrial pressures and waveforms was determined at rest (supine, legs down), and after passive leg raising (volume loading). During exercise, striking increases of pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery wedge and right atrial pressures were seen. The mean pulmonary artery pressure rose 45% during the first stage of exercise (p less than 0.001) and by peak exercise it had increased 87% above resting values. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased significantly with passive leg elevation (p less than 0.001) and during the first stage of exercise rose 61% above baseline values. By peak exercise the mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure was more than double the resting value. Similarly, the right atrial mean pressure increased significantly (p less than 0.001) with passive leg elevation and nearly tripled at peak exercise. All values promptly returned to near baseline after exercise. The cardiac output increased 98% during exercise. During early exercise, the rise in cardiac output was mediated primarily by an increase in stroke volume. At rest, there was an abnormal response in right atrial mean pressure during slow deep inspiration in 7 individuals with legs down and in 12 after passive leg elevation (volume loading), including 4 of 10 patients studied beyond 1 year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical diagnoses, hemodynamics before contrast media administration, left ventricular ejection fraction, case duration, contrast volume and cine film quality were similar in the 2 groups. The condition of 1 patient assigned to receive Renografin was deemed too unstable and Hexabrix was safely used. In the other patients, a total of 17 adverse reactions occurred (7 before administration of contrast and thus unrelated: 4 Hexabrix- and 3 Renografin-assigned patients, difference not significant). Three contrast-induced adverse reactions were considered minor (Hexabrix 2, Renografin 1, difference not significant). Severe adverse reactions requiring intervention, such as pulmonary edema and hypotension, were more frequent in patients who received Renografin (6 of 38, 16%) as compared with Hexabrix (1 of 43, 2%) (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, Hexabrix is tolerated better than Renografin and should be considered for routine use.\r"

In view of this, the relationships among degree of starch gelatinization, in vitro digestion rate, and in vivo metabolic response in rats were studied. Wheat starch with different degrees of gelatinization was used in the experiments. Plasma glucose and insulin responses as well as the rate of in vitro hydrolysis with alpha-amylase were strongly correlated to the degree of starch gelatinization (r = 0.88, r = 0.90, and r = 0.96, respectively). Plasma glucose and insulin responses were also positively correlated to the rate of hydrolysis with alpha-amylase in vitro (r = 0.98 and r = 0.76, respectively). These results suggest that the degree of starch gelatinization is an important determinant both for the rate of starch hydrolysis in vitro and for the metabolic response in vivo.\r"

When associations are examined within populations on the level of the individual, they often weaken or disappear. Although in some cases the suspect nutrient may have no real carcinogenic effect, it is proposed that there are at least three important methodologic problems that could prevent the observation of a true association between dietary factors and human cancer. First, diet assessment methods are inadequate to estimate true exposure with sufficient accuracy and precision especially over long periods. Second, use of retrospective diet assessment methods in case-control study designs can often introduce an important bias. Third, sufficient within-study-group contrasts are often lacking. These problems are discussed in interpreting recent cancer studies of diet, and recommendations are made for future research.\r"

Protein and sodium intake was constant throughout the study. Serum glucose concentration was not affected by diet but the serum total neutral amino acids (ie, sum of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine) tended to increase during undereating and decrease during overeating. Serum tryptophan concentration, relative to the remaining neutral amino acids, was consequently lower during undereating than overeating. The postprandial increase in serum insulin level was greater during overeating than undereating. Urinary free norepinephrine and total dopamine levels were also increased during overeating, suggesting both sympathetic and dopaminergic activation during overeating after undereating.\r"

It has been suggested that encouraging young adolescents to gain larger amounts of weight during pregnancy may be one way to decrease their risk of low-birth-weight deliveries. This recommendation may be premature because the mechanisms underlying the interaction between maternal age and weight gain are incompletely understood and may include such diverse factors as incomplete maternal growth, reproductive immaturity, diminished maternal body size, nutritional deficiencies, socioeconomic and behavioral factors, and maternal emotional stress. This review summarizes the literature on adolescent maternal weight gain and infant birth weight and discusses the importance of considering a multifactorial model in reformulating the weight-gain recommendations for pregnant adolescents.\r"

C animals consumed this diet ad libitum; SS animals received 23% of the total calories of C but the same ratio of calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat and the same quantity and quality of all essential nutrients. Final weights of total body, heart, liver, and small intestine were lower in SS than in C animals. Protein depletion in SS compared with C animals was evident for heart, pancreas, and intestinal mucosa. Unless aggressively supplemented, low-calorie SS diets may deplete protein stores of the gastrointestinal organs of digestion and absorption and contribute to decrease in body nitrogen stores, specifically cardiac muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The multisystem involvement in acute pancreatitis (AP) is a reflection of the pancreatic gland's capacity to produce a number of potent vasoactive peptides, hormones, and enzymes. The various prognostic criteria are early evaluations of these metabolic derangements. The pathogenesis of hypocalcemia, long recognized as an indicator of severity of AP, is multifactorial. Imbalances of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-calcitonin, the interactions of glucagon, gastrin and other pancreatic hormones with PTH-calcitonin, the role of free fatty acids in binding serum calcium with albumin, and the translocation of calcium ion in muscles and liver, have been recently described but remain conflicting theories. Yet, the time-honored theory of calcium-soap formation enjoys wide acceptance. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and occasional ketoacidosis in acute pancreatitis have been studied thoroughly. The complex cause-and-effect relationship between hyperlipidemia with acute pancreatitis needs further study. The coagulation abnormalities seem to be initiated by activated trypsin, and their role in microvascular coagulation appears to form a unifying hypothesis for major organ dysfunction, but this requires further investigation. Adult respiratory distress syndrome may be the result of active enzymes that digest pulmonary surfactant and/or microvascular thrombosis. The depression of cardiac function and shock are suspected to be secondary to vasoactive peptides such as bradykinin, or myocardial depressant factor, whose structure has yet to be elucidated. The renin-angiotensin alterations and renal complications in acute pancreatitis have received scant attention in the literature. The onset of moderate visual disturbances, or even blindness, in a patient with acute pancreatitis as a result of retinal vessel thrombosis is fortunately uncommon. Rare but interesting are the manifestations such as subcutaneous fat necrosis, arthralgia, and pancreatic encephalopathy. Despite the extensive literature on the complexities of the pathogenesis of complications of acute pancreatitis, there have been very few advances in the prevention and management of specific complications. It is hoped that further work on modification of enzymatic disturbances induced in acute pancreatitis will result in its effective treatment and prevention of serious complications.\r"

Endoscopy was performed by one consultant or one of four residents. Arterial oxygen saturation was monitored continuously during endoscopy by means of a Biox III pulse oximeter and ear probe. Oxygen saturation fell during endoscopy in all three groups, but no significant differences between the groups were detected at any stage of the procedure. When all groups were combined, there was significantly less desaturation when the consultant performed the endoscopy, and he was also significantly faster in carrying out endoscopy than the residents in each group. When an inexperienced resident was compared with one with at least 6 months of experience, there were significant differences in degree of desaturation, lowest value during endoscopy and tolerance score. It is suggested that the patient at risk of hypoxemia should, if possible, be endoscoped by an experienced endoscopist.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of gluconeogenesis from amino acids in the development of fasting and absorptive hyperammonemia in cirrhosis. Somatostatin (SRIF), which is known to inhibit the hepatic disposal of gluconeogenic amino acids, was administered in a continuous infusion (500 micrograms/h) for 90 min before and 5 h after a protein meal (240 g of meat) in 11 overnight fasting patients. Plasma glucagon, insulin, gluconeogenic amino acids (GAA: alanine, serine, glycine, and threonine) and ammonia (NH3) were evaluated before the infusion, immediately before, and at 1, 3, and 5 h after the meal. As control study, the same protocol was randomly repeated in a different day with saline infusion. During the latter, a direct correlation was found between fasting glucagon and ammonia (r = 0.68; p less than 0.05). Fasting glucagon, insulin, and NH3 did not change, whereas alanine (p less than 0.05) and the GAA sum decreased (p less than 0.01). When SRIF was infused, fasting glucagon (p less than 0.05), insulin (p less than 0.05), and NH3 (p less than 0.05) decreased. Alanine did not change, and GAA sum increased (p less than 0.02). No correlations were found by plotting changes in glucagon or GAA sum and NH3. After the meal, SRIF infusion abolished the plasma response of glucagon and markedly reduced that of insulin, so that their area under the curve (AUC0-5) were reduced (p less than 0.005, for both), with respect to control study. Moreover, the AUC0-5 of alanine (p less than 0.005) and GAA sum (p less than 0.005) were increased, suggesting a reduced disposal of these compounds. In spite of this, the meal-induced early increase and the AUC0-5 of plasma NH3 observed during SRIF and saline infusion did not differ. Our results do not confirm the importance of gluconeogenesis from alpha-amino-nitrogens in determining the fasting ammonemia of cirrhosis, and suggest that this metabolic pathway does not significantly influence the protein meal-induced exacerbation of plasma ammonia.\r"

Eight of these patients had jaundice. A classical cholecystectomy in the presence of biliobiliary fistula entails grave risk to the integrity of the upper biliary tract. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography can detect these rare fistulae. It is proposed that all patients with cholelithiasis associated with jaundice be screened by sonography for evidence of biliobiliary fistula. They should then have an ERCP to detect and delineate the biliobiliary fistula. At surgery, all of these patients have a fused gall bladder with obliteration of the Calot's triangle. Both retrograde and antegrade cholecystectomy is hazardous in these cases. Instead, the gall bladder should be opened inferiorly and evacuated of all stones, followed by a partial cholecystectomy and common hepatic duct repair over a T-tube. In the presence of an associated high or low biliary stricture, a suitable bilioenteric anastomosis may be required.\r"

Our studies showed poorest survival of all three organisms in wine, and greatest growth in milk and water.

The spectrum of illness included symptomatic esophagitis and hepatic dysfunction associated with the appearance of CMV inclusion bodies, retinal lesions, and bone marrow suppression. Clinical improvement during therapy with ganciclovir was prompt and was paralleled by reversal of histological abnormalities. CMV was recovered from none of the cultured tissues after the start of therapy. Ten months after discontinuation of ganciclovir, the patient had no evidence of further CMV disease. The observation suggests that replicative CMV infection in organ-transplanted patients may be suppressed by relatively low dose ganciclovir, even when the patients are maintained on immunosuppressive regimens designed to prevent graft rejection.\r"

  ".U": "88238526\r", 
  ".W": "Immunopathologic studies over the past two decades have demonstrated that rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) can result from glomerular deposition of anti-GBM antibody, immune complexes, or from some as yet undefined mechanism that does not involve glomerular antibody deposition. The latter process may be cell mediated and resembles a small vessel vasculitis. Most cases of idiopathic RPGN are not accompanied by pathogenic glomerular immunoglobulin deposition. Recent experimental studies of immune mechanisms of glomerular injury have identified several new processes that can induce damage to the capillary wall sufficient to result in crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). These include direct effects of anti-GBM antibody alone and of the complement C5b-9 (membrane attack) complex, nephritogenic effects of inflammatory effector cells that involve reactive oxygen species and glomerular halogenation, and injury mediated by sensitized lymphocytes independently of antibody deposition. Macrophages have been shown to participate in both intracapillary and extracapillary fibrin deposition and crescent formation as well as to mediate capillary wall damage. The role of resident glomerular cells and cell-cell interactions in glomerulonephritis is still under active investigation. Despite these several advances in understanding immune injury to the glomerulus, therapy for RPGN remains largely empiric. Although the prognosis in RPGN has clearly improved over time, no form of disease-specific therapy has been clearly shown yet to be beneficial in a controlled study. Interpretation of the existing literature on therapy is complicated by the availability of only historical rather than concurrent controls, lack of attention to several variables known to affect disease outcome, and uncertainty regarding bias in favor of reporting positive results. Available data suggests that optimal outcomes may be achieved in anti-GBM nephritis by treatment with steroids, immunosuppression and plasma exchange, particularly when therapy is directed at patients with mild but rapidly progressive disease before oliguria or severe azotemia develop. Pulse steroids are probably the most cost-effective therapy for the idiopathic form of RPGN, but treatment with cytotoxic agents should be considered if clinical or histologic evidence of vasculitis is present.\r"

When compared with 12 healthy controls with two kidneys, there was no significant difference in the percentage change in clearance after the meat load. In both groups there was an inverse correlation between the percentage change in creatinine clearance and the baseline creatinine clearance (P = less than 0.01), with no significant difference in the regression lines of the two groups.

BP was well controlled. Plasma renin activity was stimulated, and plasma aldosterone was suppressed throughout the entire protocol. In contrast to the reported short-term and long-term renal effects of enalapril, lisinopril (a lysine analog of enalapril) had no short-term effect on renal function: glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction (FF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and protein excretion were all unchanged. However, following long-term therapy, both FF and RVR were decreased. Lisinopril appears to convey no specific renal pharmacological benefit.\r"

Both doses of piroxicam were significantly more effective than placebo from Hours 2 to 12 for pain intensity difference (PID) and relief scores, as well as for SPID and TOTAL. Aspirin was significantly more effective than placebo from Hours 2 to 8 for relief and Hours 2 to 10 for PID as well as SPID and TOTAL. Piroxicam 40 mg was significantly more effective than aspirin 648 mg for SPID, TOTAL, and hourly measures beginning with Hour 6 through Hour 12. Piroxicam 20 mg was significantly better than aspirin for a few hourly measures: Hours 7 to 9 for relief and Hour 7 for PID. In addition, effects of piroxicam 20 mg had a significantly longer duration than aspirin. Similarly, piroxicam 20 mg had a significantly longer time to remedication compared with aspirin and placebo. The results of these studies provide evidence in support of the longer duration of analgesic efficacy of piroxicam compared with codeine or aspirin in patients with postoperative pain.\r"

  ".W": "Dysmenorrhea, which may be primary or secondary, is the occurrence of painful uterine cramps during menstruation. Until a decade ago, medical and social attitudes toward dysmenorrhea were shrouded with folklore, psychoanalytical profiles, or psychosomatic bases. In secondary dysmenorrhea, there is a visible pelvic lesion to account for the pain, whereas only a biochemical abnormality is responsible for primary dysmenorrhea. Recent advances in the biochemistry of prostaglandins and their role in the pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea and intrauterine device (IUD)-induced dysmenorrhea have now firmly established a rational basis for the disorder. In primary dysmenorrhea, menstrual prostaglandin release is significantly increased but can be readily suppressed to normal levels when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) capable of inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase are given during menstruation. Many clinical trials (controlled and uncontrolled) have demonstrated the efficacy of NSAIDs such as the fenamates, indole-acetic acid derivatives, and arylpropionic acid derivatives in relieving primary dysmenorrhea as well as IUD-induced dysmenorrhea that is also due to elevated prostaglandin levels. With a few of these NSAIDs, it has been shown that the relief of pain is associated with a significant decrease in menstrual fluid prostaglandin levels. Cumulative data of clinical trials indicate that with the effective NSAIDs, 80 percent of patients with significant primary dysmenorrhea can be adequately relieved. Ongoing studies suggest that in some women, endometrial leukotriene, but not PGF2a production, is increased. With the official approval and availability of several effective NSAIDs for the specific treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in the United States, women who have primary dysmenorrhea have been greatly relieved and their productivity increased. Primary dysmenorrhea affects 50 percent of postpubescent women and absenteeism among the severe dysmenorrheics has been estimated to cause about 600 million lost working hours or 2 billion dollars annually. Thus, an effective, simple, and safe treatment of primary dysmenorrhea for two to three days during menstruation will not only have a positive economic impact but will also enhance the quality of life. The availability of effective dysmenorrhea therapy with NSAIDs has induced greater expectations of relief by the patient, as well as greater willingness to seek medical help, a more rational approach to patient management by physicians, changes in attitude toward women with primary dysmenorrhea, and the debunking of myths about dysmenorrhea that often have been perpetuated as fact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Of the four categories of oral analgesics, three have been available since the 19th century. Although adequate doses of the more potent oral opioids such as morphine and methadone are effective even in severe pain, the commonly used \"weak\" narcotics such as codeine and propoxyphene are no more effective than usual doses of aspirin or acetaminophen. Furthermore, the opioids produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects, and, during long-term administration, tolerance may develop and there is a risk of drug dependence. Aspirin and acetaminophen are the traditional agents of choice for oral analgesic therapy; until 10 years ago, there were no single-entity, oral analgesics--with the exception of large doses of oral narcotics--that were more effective than usual doses of aspirin or acetaminophen. However, there is a ceiling on the analgesic effect attainable with safe doses of these drugs, which may in part be overcome through the use of the third category of oral analgesics, combinations of aspirin or acetaminophen with oral opioids. The fourth category of oral analgesics constitutes the most important recent development in pain management with analgesic drugs: the newer peripherally acting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, some of which are clearly more efficacious than aspirin or acetaminophen and compare favorably not only with full doses of narcotic combination products but even, in some cases, with strong injectable opioids. On repeated dosing, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are better tolerated than aspirin and some have a much longer duration of analgesic effect than aspirin or acetaminophen. Further study is needed to compare nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs among themselves and to determine their value in chronic pain and in combination therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-eight women with primary dysmenorrhea were randomly assigned to one of five four-times-daily treatment groups for a minimum of three days and a maximum of five days. Three of the groups received different initial single-daily doses of piroxicam, which were followed on each treatment day with placebo for the second through fourth doses, namely, piroxicam 20 mg daily for five days (piroxicam 20 mg for five days); piroxicam 40 mg on Day 1, followed by piroxicam 20 mg on Days 2 through 5 (piroxicam 40 mg for one day); and piroxicam 40 mg on Days 1 and 2, followed by piroxicam 20 mg on Days 3 through 5 (piroxicam 40 mg for two days). The fourth group received ibuprofen 400 mg four times per day, and the fifth group received placebo four times per day. Patients determined the severity of overall discomfort and pelvic-abdominal pain at baseline and prior to each dose using a four-point numerical scale. Supplemental ibuprofen, 400 mg four times per day, was provided for those patients requiring additional pain relief. Patients also made a global determination of overall relief at the end of the study. At 24 hours, the results revealed that piroxicam 40 mg for two days, piroxicam 20 mg for five days, and ibuprofen provided significantly more relief of overall discomfort compared with placebo (p = 0.003, p = 0.018, and p = 0.026, respectively). All four active treatment groups also experienced significantly more relief of pelvic-abdominal pain compared with placebo: piroxicam 40 mg for two days followed by three days of 20 mg (p = 0.002), piroxicam 40 mg for one day followed by four days of 20 mg (p = 0.023), piroxicam 20 mg for five days (p = 0.012), and ibuprofen (p = 0.011). A significantly smaller percentage of patients treated with piroxicam 40 mg for two days required supplemental medication as compared with those treated with piroxicam 20 mg for five days (p = 0.035) and patients treated with placebo (p = 0.010). A greater amount of overall relief was obtained by patients treated with piroxicam 40 mg for two days compared with patients treated with piroxicam 40 mg for one day (p = 0.041) and placebo-treated patients (p = 0.001). It was concluded that single daily doses of piroxicam 20 mg and 40 mg were as effective as ibuprofen, 400 mg four times per day, for the relief of primary dysmenorrhea.\r"

  ".W": "The severity of postoperative dental pain can be variable depending on the type of procedure. Both centrally acting and peripherally acting analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and acetaminophen are used. NSAIDs are generally better suited to ambulatory outpatients. The most commonly used postoperative dental pain model includes patients who have undergone surgical removal of impacted third molar teeth. The analgesic efficacy of piroxicam in this pain model was studied both in the United States and in foreign centers. The foreign studies suggest that piroxicam at 20-mg doses produces analgesia in patients with postoperative dental pain. Seven single-dose, randomized, double-blind trials of 798 patients in the United States more clearly evaluated the efficacy of piroxicam. These studies used various doses of piroxicam (5, 10, 20, and 40 mg), aspirin 648 mg, and placebo. Safety results showed that a wide range of piroxicam doses were safe when administered in single doses. Although neither piroxicam 5 mg nor 10 mg produced clinically significant analgesia, 20-mg and 40-mg doses were significantly superior to placebo and both were comparable with aspirin 648 mg over the initial six hours. Piroxicam 20 mg and 40 mg, however, produced significantly longer durations of analgesia than aspirin 648 mg, and it appears that the analgesic effect of piroxicam may extend for up to 24 hours in a substantial proportion of patients.\r"

The piroxicam dosage was 40 mg once daily for two days and then 20 mg daily for an additional five days. Efficacy parameters were assessed at entry and at three, seven, and 14 days. At the Day 3 visit, there was a statistically significant improvement in the piroxicam group for pain at rest, pain on movement, pain on palpation, reduced muscle force, and general limitation of function. At the Day 7 visit, the difference was still significant for pain on palpation and reduced muscle force. Mean time required for full relief of symptoms was 7.5 days in the piroxicam group and 10.2 days in the placebo group. The anti-inflammatory effects of piroxicam and naproxen were then compared in 254 patients experiencing the same types of injuries mentioned above. The dosage of piroxicam was the same as in the comparison with placebo, whereas naproxen was given 500 mg twice daily; treatment in both groups lasted for five days. There was no difference in most parameters for pain, swelling, and function. There was a significant difference in favor of piroxicam for tenderness on palpation and time to complete relief of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 20 percent of athletes have an acute or chronic injury related to their sport. In acute musculoskeletal disorders, inflammation is an important component of the symptomatology. Recent clinical studies are showing that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can significantly reduce inflammation and help speed return to full function. In an international study, the efficacy and toleration of piroxicam were compared with that of indomethacin, naproxen, and aspirin in three multicenter, double-blind, parallel studies involving a total of 1,290 patients with acute sprains and tendinitis. The centers compared piroxicam 40 mg once daily for the first two days followed by 20 mg once daily for the remainder of the studies. This regimen was compared with either indomethacin, 50 mg three times per day for two days and 25 mg three times per day for the remainder of the treatment period; naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two days followed by 250 mg in the morning and 500 mg in the evening thereafter; or aspirin 4 g per day for the duration of the study. Treatment normally lasted 14 days; the minimal duration was seven days, with a maximum of 28 days. Overall assessment of efficacy was excellent or good in more than 80 percent of patients. Statistical differences were seen favoring piroxicam over aspirin (p less than 0.05) regarding reduction in tenderness and resumption of daily activities within 16 days (p less than 0.02). The study comparing piroxicam and naproxen showed a statistically significant difference in favor of piroxicam (p less than 0.025). There was no difference between piroxicam and indomethacin in the number of patients who were able to accomplish normal daily activity within 16 days. Furthermore, although efficacy was comparable among the NSAIDs, piroxicam was significantly better-tolerated than either naproxen or indomethacin. Piroxicam was also better-tolerated than aspirin, but a statistical difference was not reached.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate a potential role for insulin-mediated extra-renal potassium disposal in the clinical syndrome of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, an obese affected man was studied using the euglycemic insulin clamp, which, in normal and obese subjects, produces predictable, insulin dose-dependent declines in plasma potassium levels. During a 20 mU/m2/minute euglycemic clamp (insulin level, 88 microU/ml) procedure, while the patient with hypokalemic periodic paralysis demonstrated severe resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake (glucose uptake 50 percent of that of normal control subjects, n = 17), his plasma potassium declined to a degree similar to that seen in normal subjects. During a subsequent higher dose, 200 mU/m2/minute insulin infusion (insulin level, 914 microU/ml), plasma potassium declined to 2.5 meq/liter, a value significantly below that seen in normal (n = 19) (3.3 +/- 0.1 meq/liter) and obese (n = 6) (3.2 +/- 0.1 meq/liter) subjects. During this study, paralysis began in the patient's hand and forearm at the potassium nadir and lasted three hours, despite restoration of normokalemia 30 minutes after paralysis began. Glucose disposal rates during this high-dose insulin infusion were one-half that seen in lean control subjects (n = 19) and similar to those in obese control subjects. If these findings are representative of hypokalemic periodic paralysis and can be generalized to larger numbers of patients, they indicate several new features of this syndrome. The ability of insulin to induce hypokalemia is enhanced in this syndrome even in the presence of marked coexistent obesity-related resistance to the action of insulin to promote glucose utilization. Enhanced sensitivity of potassium uptake systems to activation by insulin (and other factors) may be a central feature of this syndrome. Additionally, paralytic hypokalemia can be induced during a euglycemic insulin clamp procedure, which could be utilized as a diagnostic test for this syndrome.\r"

Following evaluation of glutamic acid as a potential modifier of vincristine toxicity in preclinical studies in mice and a preliminary clinical trial, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted by the Piedmont Oncology Association. Of 87 patients entered into the study, 84 were evaluable, including 42 patients who were randomly assigned to receive vincristine 1.0 mg/m2 weekly for six doses and 42 patients who were assigned to receive glutamic acid 500 mg orally three times daily plus vincristine. The following neurotoxic signs and symptoms were evaluated before each dose of vincristine: reflex changes, paresthesias, constipation, strength, and mental changes. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex, an objective parameter, was noted in 19 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 42 percent of control subjects (p = 0.03). Development of moderate to severe paresthesias, a subjective parameter, occurred in 19 percent of the glutamic acid group and 36 percent of the placebo group (p = 0.09). Overall moderate neurotoxicity (6 units or more), determined by adding the grade of each neurotoxic parameter for the weekly clinic visit in which maximum neurotoxicity occurred, was observed in 21 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 43 percent of those in the control group (p = 0.04). Hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects occurred with similar frequency in the two groups. The administration of glutamic acid has decreased vincristine-induced neurotoxicity without any attendant side effects.\r"

Pre- and post-transplant vascular diseases were closely linked. However, after taking pre-transplant vascular disease into account, multivariate analysis showed that a number of known risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and serum cholesterol) were independently associated with post-transplant vascular disease. In addition, the number of acute rejection episodes (all treated with high doses of corticosteroids) was also independently linked to vascular disease. These results suggest that an increased prevalence of known risk factors, and events linked to allograft rejection, explain the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in renal transplant recipients.\r"

Passage is influenced by aging, stress, lighting, drugs, amino acids, and neurotoxins. Disruption of the BBB results in complex changes in the blood and CSF levels of peptides. Peptides influence the passage of glucose, amino acids, and inorganic acids and may affect the integrity of the BBB.

In addition, drugs such as D-penicillamine, hydralazine, procainamide, or quinidine induce T-cell or B-cell changes which precipitate auto-reactivity and cause drug-induced disease. Intervention in autoimmune diseases with prednisone, alkylating agents or the future use of more selective monoclonal antibody reagents may be life-saving in some of these disorders.\r"

This program is modeled on the 15-year-old National High Blood Pressure Education Program, which has played a major role in improving the detection and treatment of hypertension in this country. Similar success can be predicted for the National Cholesterol Education Program, given the similarity between these two risk factors--hypertension and cholesterol--in (1) the accumulated scientific evidence for the benefit of intervention, (2) the availability of classification and treatment guidelines, and (3) the approach to professional and public health education programs. The new National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines recommend that all adults undergo a blood cholesterol measurement at least once every 5 years. Patients with a level greater than 200 mg/dl (confirmed by a second measurement) should be advised to adopt a step 1 fat-controlled diet. Patients with a cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dl are candidates for intensive treatment with step 2 diet and sometimes drugs, as are those in the 200 to 240 mg/dl range who are at especially high risk because they already have coronary heart disease or two other risk factors. However, drugs for lowering blood cholesterol levels should be used only when the indication has been confirmed by measurements of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and as a supplement to continuing the dietary treatment.\r"

  ".U": "88238699\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism that induces maternal hypertriglyceridemia in late normal pregnancy, and its physiologic significance are reviewed as a model of the effects of sex steroids on lipoprotein metabolism. In the pregnant rat, maternal carcass fat content progressively increases up to day 19 of gestation, then declines at day 21. The decline may be explained by the augmented lipolytic activity in adipose tissue that is seen in late pregnancy in the rat. This change causes maternal circulating free fatty acids and glycerol levels to rise. Although the liver is the main receptor organ for these metabolites, liver triglyceride content is reduced. Circulating triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride levels are highly augmented in the pregnant rat, indicating that liver-synthesized triglycerides are rapidly released into the circulation. Similar increments in circulating VLDL-triglycerides are seen in pregnant women during the third trimester of gestation. This increase is coincident with a decrease in plasma postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity, indicating a reduced removal of circulating triglycerides by maternal tissues or a redistribution in their use among the different tissues. During late gestation in the rat, tissue lipoprotein lipase activity varies in different directions; it decreases in adipose tissue, the liver, and to a smaller extent the heart, but increases in placental and mammary gland tissue. These changes play an important role in the fate of circulating triglycerides, which are diverted from uptake by adipose tissue to uptake by the mammary gland for milk synthesis, and probably by the placenta for hydrolysis and transfer of released nonesterified fatty acids to the fetus. After 24 hours of starvation, lipoprotein lipase activity in the liver greatly increases in the rat in late pregnancy; this change is not seen in virgin animals. This alteration is similar to that seen in liver triglyceride content and plasma ketone body concentration in the fasted pregnant rat. In the fasting condition during late gestation, heightened lipoprotein lipase activity is the proposed mechanism through which the liver becomes an acceptor of circulating triglycerides, allowing their use as ketogenic substrates, so that both maternal and fetal tissues may indirectly benefit from maternal hypertriglyceridemia. Changes in the magnitude and direction of lipoprotein lipase activity in different tissues during gestation actively contribute both to the development of hypertriglyceridemia and to the metabolic fate of circulating triglycerides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

High levels of low-density lipoproteins and intermediate-density lipoproteins, as well as their apoproteins, are strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The lowering of the cholesterol level has been shown to produce significant regression of atherosclerotic lesions. Data also suggest an interaction between lipids and platelets, although the role of coagulation disorders as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis is difficult to assess. Although much of the data are controversial, there is evidence that platelet survival time is a strong predictor of severe vessel damage. In addition, some studies have reported decreased activity of antithrombin III with coronary artery disease, and there appears to be a direct correlation between fibrinogen and cholesterol levels. Finally, diabetes mellitus (both types I and II) is a significant independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. The risk is not related to the severity or duration of diabetes, and it appears to be greater in women than in men.\r"

Type A personality and stress, on the other hand, appear to be moderate risk factors for coronary heart disease in women as well as in men. Approximately twice as many cardiovascular events occurred in type A women 35 to 64 years old as in type B women of the same age group. As expected, cigarette smoking is a major risk factor, primarily in young women. Women with smoking patterns similar to those of men experience similar rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, smoking apparently acts synergistically with oral contraceptives and elevated total serum cholesterol to further increase risk.\r"

Although there is at present a paucity of reliable data, several key points emerge. In general, working women are in better health than homemakers or unemployed women. Single and married working women are apparently in better health than are divorced, separated, or widowed women. Among working women perception of control over the job environment may be a more important predictor of risk than level of job stress. Health appears to be compromised most among women who perceive little control over their lives. Although multiple social roles of wife, mother, and employee seem to enhance health, too much intensity in any one role may be detrimental.\r"

  ".U": "88238704\r", 
  ".W": "Widespread use of oral contraceptive formulations by women throughout their reproductive life has given rise to concerns about the effects of oral contraceptives on risk factors for coronary heart disease. Oral contraceptive-induced changes in both carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors may contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors for coronary heart disease are reviewed, and oral contraceptive-induced changes in carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism, which may lead to altered risk status for coronary heart disease, are discussed. The importance of methodology in evaluating the results of studies assessing such oral contraceptive-induced changes is stressed. The role of progestins in influencing coronary heart disease risk factors is surveyed, and differences among progestins commonly used in oral contraceptive formulations are discussed. In addition, the effect of various combination oral contraceptives on risk factor status is outlined. Finally, the implications of available evidence for the selection of progestins for oral contraceptive formulations of the future are discussed. Current data indicate that medium- and low-fixed-dose oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen/norethindrone acetate have less metabolic impact than do comparable levonorgestrel-containing formulations, including multiphasic formulations. Triphasic formulations may have less effect on coronary heart disease risk factors, although data are not yet conclusive. Novel progestins such as desogestrel may also have lesser effects on metabolic functions, but the reduced androgenicity of such compounds may expose women to an increased risk of estrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

  ".U": "88238706\r", 
  ".W": "Natural fluctuations in concentrations of physiologic sex hormones over the course of a woman's lifetime affect lipoprotein levels; such effects may be compared with those induced by exogenous hormone therapy. During the progesterone-dominated luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations do not fall, but low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations usually decline. During pregnancy both estrogen and progesterone levels are extremely high; LDL concentration gradually increases to a maximum value at term of 50% above the nonpregnant level. Total HDL and HDL2 concentrations also increase, reaching a maximal 30% increase at 20 weeks' gestation. These physiological fluctuations have not been associated with increased arteriosclerosis. Oral contraceptives that combine C21 progestins and certain C19 progestin derivatives with estrogen have little or no effect on HDL2; however, those with a marked progestogenic or androgenic effect are more likely to lower HDL and HDL2. Increases in LDL concentration during oral contraceptive use are not consistently proportional to estrogen/progestin ratio and may reflect progestin androgenicity or a progestin-estrogen interaction. In postmenopausal women estrogen alone benefits lipoproteins, whereas cyclical administration of progestin with estrogen appears to lower HDL2-cholesterol proportionate to progestin dose. These exogenous hormone-induced changes are associated with the expected changes in arteriosclerosis risk when they have been looked for. In summary, estrogen-progestin regimens that do not affect LDL- and HDL2-cholesterol concentrations are most desirable in terms of long-term cardiovascular risk.\r"

Two of these studies have also demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between the progestogenic component of oral contraceptives and the risk of arterial disease, though not of venous events. In men, high levels of factor VII coagulant activity, VIIC, and plasma fibrinogen are associated with an increased risk for ischemic heart disease. In view of the dose-dependent relationship between estrogen and these two clotting factors, especially VIIC, it is likely that the effects of oral contraceptive usage on the risk for thromboembolism are mediated substantially through the level of coagulability. The relationship between the progestogenic component of oral contraceptives and the risk for arterial disease is probably related, at least in part, to the effects of progestogens on blood pressure.\r"

In addition, early studies included patients who would not receive oral contraceptives with today's more stringent prescribing criteria. When these data were carefully analyzed, a significant increase in myocardial infarction was noted only in oral contraceptive users with concomitant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Analysis of other studies also showed a significant increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality only in oral contraceptive users older than age 35 years who smoked. A recent long-term cohort study of women without risk factors for cardiovascular disease who mainly used oral contraceptives containing less than or equal to 50 micrograms estrogen showed no increased risk of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident with oral contraceptive use. Use of oral contraceptives containing less than 50 micrograms estrogen has not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy, nonsmoking women 35 to 45 years of age.\r"

Their level of glycosylated hemoglobin was initially high (14.3% and 17.5%) but within five to six months had fallen by 5.7% and 7.5%. The improved metabolic control was obtained by home blood glucose monitoring and insulin pump in the older patient and by home blood glucose monitoring only in the other. By maintaining near normoglycemia, regression of the proliferative retinopathy was achieved. Photocoagulation was not performed. After five and two years of follow-up, respectively, only mild background retinopathy has been noted in both patients. We concluded that a significant lowering of blood glucose may provoke proliferative retinopathy and that sustained good metabolic control may reverse this retinopathy without photocoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Conservative meniscal repair should limit resection to only pathologic portions of the meniscus. The periphery of the meniscus is well vascularized, enabling healing of longitudinal tears. Sutures that perforate the meniscus vertically usually lead to stable healing. In arthroscopic meniscal surgery, isolated tears are sutured from within the joint, usually using techniques related to specially developed instrumentation. Our system uses three curved cannulas of various radii and a specific needle of 1.2 mm thickness, and can be operated by one hand while the joint is distracted with an AO/ASIF femoral distractor. In our series of 54 arthroscopic meniscal repairs, 42 (78%) healed without reinjury. Retears occurred in 12 patients, and were refixed again using the same techniques. Our experience has led us to conclude that the type of meniscal tear most suitable for arthroscopic repair is a vertical longitudinal lesion that involves the vascularized zone; abrading the synovial surfaces is helpful, as is positioning the sutures tightly together; the repair should be checked at 4 months by arthroscopy or by arthrogram; and a combination of nonabsorbable and resorbable sutures is most satisfactory. We believe that with experience arthroscopic meniscal repair becomes a less involved procedure than open repair, and that in the future such repair will be successfully extended to the more centrally located lesions.\r"

Indeed, the search for broader spectrums of antibiotics may not further improve the identified results.

  ".W": "Cefotetan (formerly ICI 156834 and YM09330) is a 7-methoxy cephalosporin possessing some advantageous antimicrobial spectrum, safety, and pharmacokinetic characteristics compared with other so-called second-generation cephalosporins. The published literature was reviewed and the cefotetan quantitative susceptibility testing data from nearly 31,000 isolates was tabulated. Against 15,769 enteric bacilli, cefotetan was observed to have a potency and spectrum more closely resembling a third-generation cephalosporin and markedly superior to cefoxitin. The mean of all MIC 90s reported for the Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.06 to 13 micrograms/ml except for citrobacter species, E. cloacae, Enterobacter species, and C. freundii. The mean MIC 50 for all 22 recorded species was in the susceptible range. Cefotetan was very effective against B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and pathogenic Neisseria species. However, cefotetan and cefoxitin were not active against Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and some rarely isolated species. Cefotetan was moderately active against the staphylococci (mean MIC 50, 7.6 to 26 micrograms/ml) and streptococci (mean MIC 50, 0.9 to 6.6 micrograms/ml). The coagulase-negative staphylococcus species generally had higher cefotetan and cefoxitin minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with the S. aureus isolates. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant to cefotetan. The enterococci, JK group diphtheroids, Corynebacterium species, and L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant. A review of 4,751 strict anaerobes showed cefotetan to have a very comparable activity and spectrum to cefoxitin. The 1,291 B. fragilis strains had a mean MIC 50 and MIC 90 of 5.4 and 23 micrograms/ml, respectively. These values were slightly superior to cefoxitin when tested in parallel. More elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations were observed for other B. fragilis group species for cefoxitin and cefotetan. The mean cefotetan MIC 90 for all other anaerobic bacteria except the Eubacterium species and Lactobacillus species predict favorable clinical efficacy. The beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan is very similar to that of other 7-methoxy cephalosporins. Cefotetan also inhibits Type Ia cephalosporinases with high enzyme affinity and is an inducer of these beta-lactamases, although cefotetan is not rapidly hydrolyzed. Synergy between cefotetan and numerous other antibiotics has been reported, but antagonism has also been occasionally observed.\r"

Cefotetan and cefoxitin differ in their in vitro spectrums of activity and cannot be used interchangeably for in vitro tests. In vitro susceptibility information failed to correlate with clinical or bacteriologic responses of treated patients when 314 anaerobic bacteria from 145 patients were evaluated. All cefotetan-resistant anaerobic bacteria were eradicated by cefotetan therapy, and 93 percent of patients with resistant strains were clinically curved. Most members of the Bacteroides distasonis-ovatus-thetaiotaomicron group of pathogens were resistant in vitro, but only one strain persisted after cefotetan therapy for a 96.6 percent cure rate. There was better correlation when 2,336 aerobic bacteria from 1,630 infected body sites were considered. Microorganisms susceptible or moderately susceptible by in vitro tests were equally responsive to therapy (95 percent of patients clinically cured and 94 percent of isolates eradicated). However, strains that were resistant by in vitro test criteria were less likely to respond clinically. Development of resistance during therapy or superinfections (1.7 percent) were not found to be clinically important problems with cefotetan chemotherapy.\r"

First, the NMTT-substituted cephalosporin drugs may cause hypoprothrombinemia by interfering with the hepatic activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Second, the antipseudomonal penicillins may cause the bleeding time to be prolonged by interfering with platelet aggregation to physiologic agonists. In surgical patients who are malnourished, have impaired gastrointestinal function, or have renal failure, the potential for these adverse effects is increased. Serious bleeding requires treatment with fresh frozen plasma when hypoprothrombinemia is caused by NMTT-containing cephalosporins, since the prothrombin time returns to baseline relatively slowly after therapy with vitamin K. Hemorrhage caused by beta-lactam-induced platelet dysfunction must be treated with platelet concentrates, since new platelets sufficient to correct the defect do not enter the circulation for several days after treatment with the offending drug is discontinued. The more desirable approach is to prevent hypoprothrombinemia by giving vitamin K prophylaxis and to avoid beta-lactams that impair platelet function in seriously ill patients at increased risk for bleeding.\r"

Nevertheless, these trials all support the use of these newer cephalosporins in the treatment of intraabdominal infections. These newer agents demonstrate increased in vitro antimicrobial activity against potential aerobic pathogens, which suggests that they may be used in combination with an antianaerobic drug in the treatment of intraabdominal infections. Therefore, agents including cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and aztreonam may be chosen in place of the standard aminoglycoside. Previous studies have demonstrated the necessity of both aerobic and anaerobic coverage in empiric therapy of intraabdominal infections. Cefotetan, ceftizoxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, mezlocillin, and piperacillin all have in vitro activity against aerobes and anaerobes (including B. fragilis), thus, these agents have a potential as monotherapy for acute intraabdominal infections in otherwise healthy patients. Directed combination chemotherapy or perhaps imipenem alone is recommended for persistent peritonitis and intraabdominal infections in immunocompromised hosts.\r"

  ".W": "After an uncertain and highly controversial beginning, the use of antimicrobials for prophylaxis of surgical wound infection has evolved to represent state-of-the-art management of the surgical patient. Although a truly ideal prophylactic antimicrobial does not exist, the cephalosporins, particularly those of the first generation, have emerged as the mainstay of prophylaxis in surgery. However, new pathogens and newly recognized problems have necessitated a comparative evaluation of a wide variety of antibiotic regimens. The choice of an appropriate antibiotic is complicated by the lack of an adequate experimental model of infection in clean and clean-contaminated surgical procedures. Moreover, clinical trials have proved to be an inefficient method of comparing antibiotic regimens, as important variations in risk factors for infection cannot be reliably controlled. Significant differences exist among cephalosporins and between the cephalosporins and other classes of antimicrobials in several clinically important parameters: antimicrobial spectrum, serum half-life, ease of administration, tissue penetrability, cost, and incidence of allergy and toxicity. New generations of cephalosporins and new classes of antibiotics have demonstrated the potential to out-perform the first-generation cephalosporins in many of these areas. Although the first-generation cephalosporins were essential in establishing the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery, there are no guarantees that this class of cephalosporin, or that any cephalosporin, for that matter, will continue to dominate the prophylactic arena.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Female rats receiving ethanol in the drinking water before and during gestation (ET) were compared to pair-fed animals (PF) and normal controls (C) fed ad libitum. On the 21st day of gestation the maternal body and liver weight, blood glucose, and plasma protein concentrations were lower in ET and PF animals as compared to C. In contrast to C or PF mothers, ET-fed mothers had higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate and triacyglyceride levels and beta-hydroxy-butyrate/acetoacetate ratio. Liver triacylglycerides were increased whereas liver glycogen concentration was reduced in ET-fed animals. Only fetal body and liver weights and blood glucose were lower in both ET and PF than in C. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate was increased and liver glycogen was decreased only in ET fetuses. There were no differences among the groups in fetal circulating beta-hydroxy-butyrate/acetoacetate ratio, plasma proteins, and triacylglycerides or liver triacyglyceride content. Results indicate that certain changes in ET mothers are specifically produced by the ethanol intake rather than undernutrition. Further, metabolic changes occurring in the fetus are influenced by the ethanol effects in the mother and these actions may be added to those directly produced by the ethanol crossing the placenta. However, the collaterals were three times more likely to report more drinking days than the patients; 40.4% (86/213) of the cohabiting contacts reported more drinking days compared to 12.7% (27/213) of the patients reporting more drinking days (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our recently completed Veterans Administration Cooperative Study evaluating the efficacy of disulfiram treatment for alcoholism provided an opportunity to assess the validity of self-report. To assess treatment response, patients and household contacts were interviewed at seven scheduled points during the 1 year of follow-up. Blood specimens also were obtained from the patients at these times and were analyzed for ethanol. Eighty-eight percent of the patient and/or collateral interviews were obtained at 6 months and 90% at 1 year. The mean number of blood and urine specimens collected per patient was 4.3 and 14.4, respectively. Outcome criteria included continuous abstinence during the year and total number of drinking days. Continuous abstinence: If we had had only the patients' self reports, we would have significantly underestimated the percentage of men who drank. By self-report 58.7% (355/605) relapsed whereas the combination of self report, collaterals' reports, and laboratory tests indicated that 72.4% (438/605) drank (p less than 0.001). Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability that a patient is continuously abstinent for 1 year when he so claims is 65%. Total drinking days: Of the 213 patient-collateral pairs each of whom provided all seven scheduled interviews, 46.9% (100/213) agreed on the total number of drinking days during the year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The intraperitoneal infusion of ethanol (EtoH) (1 g/hr/kg body weight for 3 hr) to intact rats blunted the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin induced by a subsequent 10-min exposure to mild, inescapable electroshocks (1.5 mA; 2 sec; four shocks/min) or by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Conversely, administration of the shocks for 3 hr diminished the pituitary response to an acute i.p. injection of EtoH. While we have previously shown (Rivier C, Vale W: Endocrinology 121:1320-1328, 1987) that prolonged stress induces a loss of pituitary responsiveness due to the depletion of pituitary ACTH stores, the infusion of EtoH did not cause statistically significant changes in pituitary ACTH content. In adrenalectomized rats, the infusion of EtoH caused an elevation of ACTH plasma levels that was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) larger than intact animals. These rats also showed a blunted pituitary response to the acute injection of CRF, possibly because they were already secreting ACTH at a maximal rate. These results support the hypothesis that CRF, stress, and alcohol do not potentiate each other on pituitary ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion.\r"

Although the red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and hemoglobin concentration were not significantly different between treatment and control groups, treatment with ethanol altered the relative proportion of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the peripheral blood. The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells in the bone marrow were unaffected by ethanol treatment, but a significant decline in the number of erythroid progenitor cells was noted in ethanol-treated rats. Splenic lymphocytes, although fewer in number in the ethanol-treated rats, showed no significant difference in ability to proliferate when stimulated by nonspecific mitogens.\r"

Neither inhibition of ethanol metabolism with 4-methylpyrazole, nor a 10-fold elevation of acetaldehyde levels by inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase with cyanamide or disulfiram, affected the magnitude of the GSH depletion observed in vivo. The rate of intracellular GSH accumulation by isolated hepatocytes incubated with cysteine or methionine was not inhibited by the addition of 80 mM ethanol. A significantly decreased rate of GSH accumulation was, however, found in hepatocytes isolated from ethanol-intoxicated animals. Neither the in vivo pretreatment with ethanol nor its in vitro addition to isolated hepatocytes affected the rate of GSH efflux. The results suggest that ethanol itself, rather than its metabolic products, causes depletion of liver GSH, and that events occurring in vivo are required for such an effect to be exerted.\r"

Dietary intake of vitamin D3 did not differ significantly between the groups. The calcium level was below lower limit of reference in nine alcoholics (26%). Serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone and phosphorus were within normal ranges in both groups, and no differences were observed in levels of magnesium, vitamin D-binding protein, calcitonin, or alkaline phosphatase.

The current study examined the family history, personality, and substance use/abuse correlates of Tarter et al.'s HK/MBD questionnaire and factor analytically derived subscales (Alterman and McLellan, 1986) in a nonclinical sample of 580 young, adult males. In addition, a factor analysis of the HK/MBD questionnaire was undertaken to assess the extent to which the factor structure determined on a clinical alcoholic sample replicates in a nonclinical sample. Results indicated that each of the HK/MBD subscales showed relatively unique patterns of correlations with the various personality measures employed suggesting that they are measuring separate constructs. Perhaps of greatest importance, the HK/MBD items that appear to be of greatest relevance for understanding substance use/abuse are those related to antisocial behavior. Finally, the factor structure of the HK/MBD questionnaire in the nonclinical sample was found to be quite similar to the structure obtained in a clinical sample. These results demonstrate the multidimensional structure of the HK/MBD questionnaire and the utility of using the more homogeneous subscales in research with both clinical and nonclinical samples.\r"

Testosterone levels in male fetuses were measured on Days 17 through 20 of gestation. The normal surge of testosterone on Days 18 and 19 was present in controls, but notably absent in male fetuses exposed to alcohol. Light microscopic examination of the testes at birth revealed a reduction in the number of leydig cells in the alcohol exposed group and the presence of a large number of vacuoles in the seminiferous tubules. In vitro studies of fetal testes at 18 and 22 days of gestation revealed that this in utero alcohol exposure regimen produced a marked insensitivity to rat LH (10 ng/ml) stimulation of testosterone secretion compared to controls. The response to ethanol (160 mg/dl) in alcohol exposed testes was characterized by a long-lasting suppression of testosterone compared to a large increase observed in control testes. No differences in anogenital distance were observed among the groups. Together, these data may explain some of the long-term feminizing and demasculinizing effects on reproductive and nonreproductive sexually dimorphic behaviors observed in adult males prenatally exposed to alcohol.\r"

Pair members were matched on age, height, weight, grade point average, and personal drinking history. Three auditory tasks which differed in stimulus discrimination difficulty were presented to each subject. All tasks employed 20% target and 80% standard tones with the subject required to move their index finger whenever a target stimulus was detected. No significant differences in P300 amplitude or latency were obtained between the family history subject groups, although female FHP subjects tended to have smaller P300 amplitudes than their FHN counterparts. P300 amplitude decreased with increases in the amount of self-reported alcohol consumed for FHP subjects but significantly so only for the most difficult task situation. The results suggest that the relationship between the P300 ERP and the inheritability of alcoholism is not yet clear and may be subject to modulation by task requirements, population differences, and subject sex.\r"

The concentration of ethanol in vapor above the lacrimal fluid in the eye was analyzed in situ by the use of a fast (1-min) gas sensor method developed previously for biological liquids. After an oral dose of 1 g/kg to 11 animals, eye vapor measurements and blood samples were obtained over 4 hr. The correlation of 61 blood ethanol concentrations obtained by the two methods yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and a slope of 0.99. The metabolic rates of ethanol determined by gas chromatographic analysis of blood and by ethanol eye vapor analysis are virtually identical. The data suggest that ethanol eye vapor analysis may be an attractive, noninvasive method for the determination of ethanol in animals. The method is not subject to false high readings due to alcohol in the buccal cavity and thus might constitute an alternative to breath analysis in the human. In a separate series, ethanol was determined by head space gas chromatography in samples of blood and lacrimal fluid while the animals were under ketamine anesthesia. The correlation of ethanol concentrations in blood and lacrimal fluid (r = 0.99) shows that ethanol is distributed in lacrimal fluid which comprises part of total body water.\r"

Rats prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited less side preference in a two-lever operant chamber while responding for food reward and alternated between the left and right levers more than either control group, which did not differ from each other. Although side preference increased over days of testing in the control groups, the 35% EDC subjects' side preference did not change with increased experience. When responding on a nonrewarded schedule (extinction), the three prenatal treatment groups did not differ in side preference. Alcohol-exposed offspring also displayed a marked difference in paw use compared to control subjects: while most of the control subjects used one paw preferentially, 35% EDC subjects used both paws together or alternated paws. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to alter the normal development of behavioral laterality, and this altered development persists into adulthood. Prenatal alcohol exposure may also alter the functional interaction between intrinsic laterality and reward contingencies.\r"

Each subject was tested in a single-blind, latin-square crossover design with the following six conditions: placebo ethanol/placebo marihuana; low dose ethanol/placebo marihuana; high dose ethanol/placebo marihuana; placebo ethanol/marihuana; low dose ethanol/marihuana; and high dose ethanol/marihuana. The variables measured in the study were: (a) subjective rating of ethanol and/or marihuana intoxication; (b) heart rate; (c) accuracy and latency of response in the Simulator Evaluation of Drug Impairment (SEDI) task; (d) blood ethanol concentration by gas chromatography; and (e) plasma concentration of THC by radioimmunoassay. The results indicate that the decrements due to ethanol in performance of skills necessary to drive an automobile were significantly enhanced by marihuana in an additive and perhaps synergistic manner. The administration of ethanol prior to marihuana smoking did not produce significant effects on the subjective rating of \"high,\" heart rate acceleration, or THC plasma concentration.\r"

CCK octapeptide and BBS tetradecapeptide were injected intraperitoneally in both single doses and combinations of doses to determine interactions of the two peptides in the control of consumption of ethanol. Water-deprived rats were given access to 5% w/v ethanol for 30 min, followed by a 30-min access to water, daily. One minute before presentation of ethanol, rats were injected with either saline or one of ten peptide solutions (three of CCK alone, three of BBS alone, and four combinations of both). Results from the injections of single peptides were used to determine predicted inhibitions of the peptide combinations, assuming perfect additivity of doses. None of the actual values of inhibition of intake of ethanol by peptide combinations differed significantly from its predicted additive value. Endogenous CCK-like and BBS-like peptides may suppress intake of ethanol by an additive mechanism of inhibition.\r"

The molecular basis for these manifestations observed in animals exposed to ethanol in utero may be explained by changes in regional catecholamine content and turnover. This study was designed to determine changes in catecholamine content and turnover in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medial basal hypothalamus, diencephalon, and septal area of male rats exposed to ethanol pre- and postnatally. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either an ad libitum liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories, an isocalorically matched liquid diet, or a diet consisting of laboratory chow and water. Regional alterations in catecholamine content and turnover in each of the brain areas were observed on postnatal Day 18. A regional variability was demonstrated in the effect of in utero ethanol exposure on catecholamine content and turnover. The most dramatic effect was found in the dopaminergic neurons of the medial basal hypothalamus where in utero ethanol exposed offspring had a significantly reduced DA content and turnover when compared to pups from both isocalorically matched and chow-fed dams. These data indicate that the dopaminergic neurons of this particular brain region are susceptible to alteration by ethanol exposure during development and that this alteration cannot be explained by changes in nutrition alone.\r"

  ".W": "In Canada, deaths from liver cirrhosis have declined by about 25% since 1974. To gain further insight into the nature of this decline, mortality rates for the years 1974-1984 and morbidity (hospital separation) rates for the years 1974-1980 were examined by age and sex and by province and sex. As well, survey data on drinking practices in Ontario were analyzed. Both mortality and morbidity declined over the time period involved, although variations over provinces, age groups, and sex were observed. The pattern of variations (largest declines in provinces with highest per capita alcohol consumption and in young to middle-aged males) strongly suggests decreased incidence of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Among the factors which may be contributing to these declines are: the stabilization and small decreases in per capita consumption of alcohol; consumption pattern changes consistent with observed mortality and morbidity changes; expanded health promotion activities; and increases in the numbers of alcoholics receiving treatment.\r"

After a first IVGTT while awake, patients received a second IVGTT either while awake (group I), during anesthesia with isoflurane-air and pancuronium without surgical stimulation (group II), or during the same anesthetic technique but combined with surgery (group III). Isoflurane seemed to induce glucose intolerance (glucose disappearance rate K10-60 min = 1.628 +/- 0.462% min-1 [control] versus 1.086 +/- 0.920% min-1 [anesthesia], P less than 0.05) partly due to a decreased glucose induced insulin response. Growth hormone and norepinephrine levels were also increased during anesthesia. Epinephrine levels were lowered by isoflurane anesthesia. Although glucose intolerance was marked during surgery (K10-60 min = 0.892 +/- 0.286% min-1), the glucose-induced insulin response remained similar to that observed in patients in group II, while growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly. These known stress factors thus seemed to enhance glucose intolerance through a diminished response to insulin action and/or an enhanced hepatic glucose output, rather than by further impairing pancreatic insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative pain was assessed in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. Ten patients received lidocaine aerosol in the surgical wound before skin closure, ten patients received placebo aerosol devoid of lidocaine, and ten patients were untreated. The lidocaine-treated group had significantly lower pain scores and meperidine requirements during the first postoperative day compared to the control groups. During the second day after surgery, these variables did not differ between groups. Wound anesthesia, assessed by palpation of the wound 24 h after surgery by a blinded investigator, was significantly more pronounced in the group treated with lidocaine aerosol than in the control groups. Similarly, in patients undergoing bilateral herniorraphy, wound pain following palpation was significantly reduced on the lidocaine-treated side compared to the untreated side. Patients in the group receiving lidocaine aerosol indicated less pain in connection with mobilization than untreated patients, but not compared to patients treated with placebo aerosol. Plasma substance P (SP) and beta-endorphin (BE) measured in lidocaine-treated patients and in untreated patients before and after drug administration showed no significant differences regarding SP, while BE was significantly increased 1 h after surgery in the untreated group. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were well below toxic levels. Results show that lidocaine aerosol used as topical anesthetic in the surgical wound is simple to use, and results in a long-lasting reduction of pain after a single administration. Moreover, postoperative mobilization is facilitated, and the requirement for postoperative analgesics is reduced. Wound healing was normal, and no adverse reactions to lidocaine were reported.\r"

Pressure and volume overload would produce myocardial ischemia. During ischemia there will be an increase in xanthine and xanthine oxidase; and a decrease in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity leading to an increase in the oxygen free radicals. A decrease in the cellular pH during ischemia would release phospholipase which would, in turn, release arachidonic acid from phospholipids. Leukotrienes and prostaglandins will be synthesized through arachidonic acid metabolism. During this synthesis not only oxygen free radicals will be produced but also there will be formation of leukotriene, LTB4, which is known to activate neutrophil and hence increased secretion of oxygen free radicals. Increased circulatory catecholamines due to compensatory mechanism would also lead to an increase in the oxygen free radicals. Oxygen free radicals are known to depress Ca++ binding and uptake of sarcoplasmic reticulum which would lead to a decrease in the myocardial contractility. We have shown that oxygen free radicals depress cardiac function and cardiac contractility. It is, therefore, suggested that oxygen free radicals might be involved in the development of heart failure. The use of agents that reduce the amount of oxygen free radicals would be of value in the prevention and treatment of heart failure.\r"

After two years 68% of the lesions remained unchanged while the degree of vessel stenosis increased in 32%; no case of regression was observed. Intrinsic factors appearing to condition an increase in degree of stenosis were \"mixed\" and \"hard\" echogenic pattern, an irregular lesion surface, and an initial degree of stenosis of more than 50%.

IRUS was performed with a Bruel and Kjaer radial scanner, type 1849, equipped with a 7.0 MHz transducer. IRUS accurately staged 3/3 rectal villous adenomas, and 11/13 rectal adenocarcinomas compared with histopathology. Clinical exam correctly staged all three villous tumors, and 6/9 carcinomas (24% of lesions were not palpable). IRUS correctly diagnosed the status of regional nodes in 88% of patients. IRUS is a highly accurate preoperative staging tool for rectal cancers both in delineating depth of bowel wall invasion and in assessing regional lymph nodes. It is easy to perform, safe, and well tolerated by the patients.

  ".W": "Most reports of the operative treatment of symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PCLD) are anecdotal or consist of only a small subset of patients in an institution's overall experience treating hepatic cysts. We have reviewed our experience with nine consecutive patients with symptomatic PCLD undergoing operative treatment from 1981 to 1987. Indications for operation include chronic abdominal pain (4 patients), cyst infection (2 patients), biliary obstruction (2 patients), inferior vena cava obstruction (2 patients), and symptomatic abdominal distention (2 patients). The average duration of symptoms leading to operation was 7.8 months. Three types of cystic disease were identified based on gross morphology: dominant cystic disease (3 patients), diffuse cystic disease (4 patients), and mixed cystic disease (2 patients). Operations to treat symptomatic PCLD included unroofing and external drainage of infected cysts (2 operations), simple unroofing (1 operation), cyst fenestration alone (4 operations) and fenestration combined with resection (3 operations). Treatment directed at principally dominant cysts (five patients) was associated with resolution of symptoms and low morbidity and mortality. Treatment directed at diffusely cystic disease (four patients) resulted in significant morbidity and mortality including three deaths. Successful surgical treatment of symptomatic patients with PCLD depends on accurate preoperative identification of patients with symptoms related to one or more dominant cysts. In this setting fenestration or simple unroofing of the dominant cyst is safe and effective treatment. By comparison, extensive fenestration with or without hepatic resection in patients with symptoms attributed to a diffusely cystic liver may be associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic value of assays to measure serum antibodies to Campylobacter pylori, and to use these assays to determine the prevalence of C. pylori infection in a healthy population. DESIGN: A survey of patients having endoscopies for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses, and healthy controls. SETTING: Outpatients attending endoscopy suites in two university-affiliated medical centers. PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty patients who had gastroduodenoscopies, 61 patients with lower intestinal illnesses, and 166 healthy controls. INTERVENTION: Assay to detect serum IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies specific for C. pylori. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Absorption with other gram-negative pathogens showed that IgG and IgA assays, but not IgM assays, were specific for C. pylori. In patients in whom C. pylori had been isolated and who had gastritis diagnosed by histologic methods, significantly higher mean IgA and IgG levels were seen compared with patients without demonstrable C. pylori or gastritis. The sensitivity and specificity of a positive value in both IgA and IgG assays were more than 93%. Among healthy persons, IgG and IgA antibodies were rarely seen in patients less than 20 years old, but antibody prevalence progressed with age, reaching 50% in patients more than 60 years old. High IgA and IgG levels to C. pylori in five persons tested remained stable for more than 1 year, suggesting the organism persists for at least that period. In 61 patients with acute bacterial enteritis, acute pancreatitis, Crohn disease, or ulcerative colitis, prevalence of antibodies to C. pylori was consistent with age and unrelated to current disease. CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter pylori infection, which is highly associated with active gastritis, may be diagnosed by serologic assay. Acquisition of infection begins in adult life, and prevalence increases with age.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized trial. SETTING: An outpatient clinical research center in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia documented by studies of first-degree relatives; nine patients with type 2b hyperlipoproteinemia, and eight patients with type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels were obtained during control periods on diet alone and on gemfibrozil therapy. Patients then received gemfibrozil and colestipol or gemfibrozil and lovastatin in a randomized order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients with type 2b hyperlipoproteinemia, gemfibrozil alone significantly reduced total cholesterol by 11%, and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apolipoprotein B by 18%, did not change LDL-cholesterol, and raised high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels by 26%. Addition of either colestipol or lovastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 17% and 25%, respectively, compared to gemfibrozil alone. However, colestipol mitigated the HDL-cholesterol raising effect of gemfibrozil and did not further reduce LDL-apolipoprotein B levels. In contrast, addition of lovastatin caused an additional reduction of LDL-apolipoprotein B 19% compared with gemfibrozil alone. In patients with type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia, gemfibrozil alone reduced triglycerides by 40%, raised HDL-cholesterol by 26%, and increased LDL-cholesterol levels by 29%. The addition of either colestipol or lovastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 34% and 33%, respectively (compared with gemfibrozil alone), but greater reductions of LDL-apolipoprotein B (30% with lovastatin compared with 15% with colestipol, compared with gemfibrozil alone), and increases in HDL-cholesterol levels (8% increase with lovastatin compared with 10% decrease with colestipol, compared to gemfibrozil alone) were seen with the lovastatin combination. CONCLUSIONS: Although gemfibrozil with either colestipol or lovastatin favorably altered lipoprotein levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and familial combined hyperlipidemia, the combination of gemfibrozil and lovastatin appeared superior overall.\r"

Before the diagnosis is made or therapy instituted, elevated blood pressure must be verified. To provide maximal protection against premature cardiovascular disease and coronary disease, various non-drug therapies should be used that lower both blood pressure and other risk factors. Drugs should be chosen to provide maximal efficacy, long-term safety, and multifaceted convenience, providing the greatest protection with the least interference with quality of life. These goals can be best achieved by substituting commonly used drugs such as diuretics, central agonists, and beta-blockers with vasodilators, such as alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium blockers.\r"

To determine the pattern of diagnostic criteria used, reports of 51 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical drug trials published between 1977 and 1985 were reviewed. Only 23 (45%) of the trials specified objective diagnostic criteria beyond treatment history, clinical diagnosis, or functional class. Of these, there were two trials each for digoxin, hydralazine, amrinone, and metoprolol; for each pair, only one study showed therapy beneficial. Of the amrinone pair, the positive study required a lower ejection fraction (less than 30% compared with less than 45%) and selected patients with more clinical severity. Conversely, for metoprolol, the positive study specified a higher ejection fraction (less than 49% compared with less than 35%) and selected patients with clinically milder disease, suggesting that conflicting results may relate to differences in study population. Many studies of congestive heart failure are done without explicit diagnostic criteria. Criteria lack uniformity, and such discrepancies may explain conflicting results.\r"

In the last decade state and local government support and federal training grant support for residency stipends declined, whereas Veterans Administration support increased. Fellowship stipend sources are much more diverse; federal training grants, professional fees, foundations, medical school funds, and research grants contribute significantly. Medicare support appears to be focused on subspecialties particularly important to the elderly, including critical care, rheumatology, cardiology, hematology, gastroenterology, and nephrology. Geriatric medicine, however, receives substantial Veterans Administration support. With growing revenue constraints and increasing concerns about excess physicians we need to monitor the impact of government regulations and other factors on funds available for training internal medicine specialists.\r"

For some years, genetic ultrastructural ciliary alterations have been recognized, with symptoms dating from early life. It is only in recent years, however, that evidence has shown that ultrastructural ciliary alterations can be acquired later in life and that these alterations in turn lead to a deterioration of efficient ciliary cleansing. A discussion of the ultrastructure of the normal mammalian cilium will be given, as well as a listing of the genetic ciliary disease and their characteristic morphologic alterations. A more complete review will be made in regard to acquired ciliary defects, their cause, the ultrastructural changes, and the relation to clinical disease.\r"

Each treatment consisted of three 30-minute sessions, during which the patient's intranasal temperature was raised by inhalation of saturated hot air (42 degrees C to 44 degrees C). Subjective response was recorded on a daily symptom score card during the week following treatment. Nasal patency was determined before and after treatment by measuring maximal nasal expiratory and inspiratory airflow and by measuring the area covered with vapor formed by the exhaled air on a plate. Highly reproducible results were obtained by using these three objective methods. Elevation of intranasal temperature resulted in amelioration of rhinitis symptoms and in objective evidence of increased nasal patency in a significant percentage of patients compared to the placebo-treated group.\r"

The study shows that LPS deteriorates ciliary activity in a dose-response fashion and that even low levels can, with extended exposure, cause dysfunction of cilia. It can be postulated that endotoxin in middle ear effusions aggravates the condition of mucociliary dysfunction thus leading to chronic OME.\r"

In the present study we examined somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase neurons in nine cortical regions in both normal and Alzheimer's disease brains. These three neurochemical markers show a high degree of co-localization (greater than 90%) in nonpyramidal neurons that are primarily distributed in cortical layers II-III, V-VI, and, most prominently, in infracortical white matter. The highest cell density was in temporal and parietal association cortex. The major morphological abnormality in Alzheimer's disease brains was a marked pruning and distortion of fiber plexuses with an apparent reduction in fiber density. In contrast, perikaryal density was preserved except for a reduction in parietal association cortex. Approximately 10 to 15% of senile plaques in the inferior temporal gyrus contained abnormal neurites. Additional abnormal collections of neurites without plaque cores were frequently found in layers II-III and V-VI. Neuropeptide Y and somatostatin were co-localized in abnormal neurites, suggesting an origin from local intrinsic neurons in which the two peptides are co-localized. Double immunofluorescence staining for both tau protein, a major antigenic component of paired helical filaments, and either somatostatin or neuropeptide Y showed that these neurons do not contain tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles. The morphological correlate of reduced somatostatin and neuropeptide Y content in Alzheimer's disease brain therefore appears to be a distortion and reduction in fiber plexuses. In addition, it is apparent that these neurons can develop widespread morphological abnormalities in the absence of neurofibrillary tangle formation.\r"

Most of the autoaggressive cells are T cells and macrophages, but some are killer/natural killer (K/NK) cells. We here compare the frequencies per 1,000 muscle fibers of endomysial K/NK cells of varying cytotoxicity with those of T cells and macrophages in 8 cases each of IBM, PM, and DD. Two-micrometer serial cryostat sections were analyzed. The Leu-4 marker, present on all T cells and some K/NK cells, and the Leu-7 and Leu-11 markers, present on K/NK cells, were localized by paired immunofluorescence. Macrophages were demonstrated by the acid phosphatase reaction. In IBM, PM and DD, the respective average cell counts per 1,000 muscle fibers were: Leu-4+7- cells (T cells not expressing a K/NK marker)--710, 530, and 59; Leu-4+7+ cells (K/NK cells of low K/NK cytotoxicity)--294, 163, and 13; Leu-4-7+ cells (K/NK cells of intermediate cytotoxicity)--32, 10, and 2; and macrophages--292, 251, and 38. Leu-11+ K/NK cells that have the highest killing activity were virtually absent in all cases. The data suggest a limited role for antigen and major histocompatibility complex unrestricted K/NK cells, as compared with antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells, in IBM and PM. Further, the findings cast doubt on the significance of either T cells or K/NK cells in mature muscle in DD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in rhesus monkeys and human patients have increased our understanding of the role of various cortical regions in the generation of smooth pursuit eye movements. Little is known, though, about the cerebral white matter pathways mediating smooth pursuit. In this paper, we describe both the corticocortical and corticosubcortical projections from areas in the monkey brain known to be involved in smooth pursuit. The corticocortical pathways within one hemisphere consist of a sequence of arcuate fiber bundles interconnecting (1) striate cortex with an area in occipitoparietal cortex called the middle temporal (MT) area, (2) area MT with two areas in parietal cortex called the medial superior temporal (MST) and posterior parietal (PP) areas, and (3) area MST with area PP. An interhemispheric pathway interconnecting areas MT and MST consists of fibers sequentially passing through the tapetum, major forceps, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The corticosubcortical pathway from area MST to the pontine nuclei and accessory optic system consists of fibers sequentially running through the internal sagittal stratum, the retrolenticular part of the internal sagittal stratum, and the cerebral peduncle. Based on the effects of lesions on pursuit eye movements, these corticocortical and corticosubcortical projections can be divided into sensory, motor, and attentional/spatial systems. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that homologous systems exist in the human cerebrum.\r"

The ultimate goal of multiple sclerosis therapy is the early treatment of patients in an attempt to halt the onset of progression. Specific strategies of immunotherapy include generation of a suppressor influence, removal of helper/inducer cells, manipulation of activated T cells, manipulation of class II major histocompatibility complex-bearing cells, alteration of lymphocyte traffic, extracorporeal removal of serum factors or cells, and manipulation of antigen-specific cells. Present treatment modalities are beginning to show some efficacy of nonspecific immunosuppression, but these treatments are limited by their toxicities. As the immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis moves to the next stage in the coming years, patients at an earlier stage of their disease will have to be treated, nontoxic forms of therapy developed, clinical trials lengthened, and a laboratory monitor of the disease developed. Given the positive effects of immunotherapy seen thus far in the disease, it is possible that appropriate immunotherapeutic intervention may provide effective treatment for the disease in the future.\r"

  ".W": "The postantibiotic effect (PAE) for 10 isolates of Escherichia coli was measured by two methods after 1 h of exposure to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or tobramycin. The reference method involved serial colony counting to determine growth after antibiotic exposure in relation to control growth. A spectrophotometric procedure was developed with the Abbott MS-2 research system. This method measured the time to detection of growth after exposure and compared this with the time for growth detection in control chambers having the same initial colony count. A reference curve of time to growth versus log initial CFU per milliliter was used to standardize control growth. PAE was determined after exposure to antibiotic at two and six times the MIC and with inocula ranging from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/ml. There was a statistically significant correlation between PAE measured by the spectrophotometric and the reference methods, and the residuals about the regression line were normally distributed. The mean PAE determined by both methods was statistically different for tobramycin-exposed, but not for ampicillin- or ciprofloxacin-exposed, organisms. There was a concentration-dependent PAE for ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. The PAEs for ciprofloxacin (151 min) and tobramycin (108 min) at concentrations six times the MIC were prolonged compared with those measured at two times the MIC (69 and 66 min, respectively). PAE was inversely related to the exposed inoculum for ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. The PAE for E. coli exposed to ampicillin was minimal and was not affected by either concentration or inoculum. The MS-2 method for determining PAE yields similar results, but is less laborious than the reference method.\r"

Within 12 h of receiving a single 25-mg/kg (body weight) dose of cyclosporine, mice with patent P. berghei infections uniformly exhibited a rapid fall in asexual parasite stages. Initially, ring forms and mature schizonts disappeared. Subsequently, trophozoites disappeared between 21 and 24 h, whereas gametocytes persisted for 36 h. In contrast, when cyclosporine was administered to mice 1 day before inoculation (100 mg/kg) with P. berghei sporozoites and for 2 consecutive days after inoculation (25 mg/kg), infections developed normally. When mice with patent infections were placed on prolonged cyclosporine therapy (25 mg/kg per day), parasitemia initially disappeared but often recrudesced. Recrudescent parasites were frequently resistant to cyclosporine (Csr). The Csr phenotype remained stable after serial passage of parasites in mice and after transmission through Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, in which the capacity to produce oocysts was reduced. When infections of untreated mice were initiated with equal numbers of Csr and cyclosporine-susceptible (Css) parasites and then carried through two serial cycles of mosquito-to-mouse transmission without cyclosporine treatment, the Csr phenotype was lost. The results indicate that cyclosporine selectively inhibits asexual blood stages of P. berghei and favors the emergence of Csr parasites with diminished infectivity for mosquitoes.\r"

The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of WR 194,965 were hydrogen bonded to the same phosphate group. The nitrogen atom was also hydrogen bonded to a second phosphate group. The phosphate ions formed discrete clusters of four phosphate moieties. The phosphate clusters contained fourfold inversion symmetry. The intramolecular N-O distance in WR 194,965 of 3.073 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) was close to the reported values for N-O distances in the active cinchona alkaloids and may be important for activity. A comparison of the crystalline structure of WR 194,965 with those of mefloquine and quinidine sulfate demonstrated that the regions of the three molecules in the vicinity of the aliphatic nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom superimpose. Much of the remainder of the WR 194,965 molecule spatially overlapped with the combined three-dimensional space defined by quinidine and mefloquine.

After a rapid absorption phase, the drug concentrations decreased in the plasma, with a terminal half-life of 14.5 h. The drug was widely distributed in the liver and lungs and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys and spleen. In rabbits, the kinetic parameters were compared after a single 10-mg/kg dose of amopyroquin base through intravenous, intramuscular (i.m.), and oral routes. The similar bioavailability values (0.67 and 0.69) suggested that the drug could be used through i.m. or oral administration. Clearance and distribution volume did not differ significantly among the three modes of administration, and the terminal half-lives were 18.1 +/- 3.3, 23.9 +/- 6.7, and 25.7 +/- 5.4 h for intravenous, i.m., and oral routes, respectively. The ratio of concentrations in erythrocytes and plasma was about 5 in rats and rabbits. Three metabolites were detected in both animal species (one was tentatively identified as the primary amine derivative). The amopyroquin in vitro activity was tested against four chloroquine-susceptible and 11 chloroquine-resistant African Plasmodium falciparum strains. For all isolates, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of amopyroquin were much lower than those of chloroquine and monodesethylamodiaquine.\r"

The overall response rate was 65%, with one patient achieving a complete response with chemotherapy alone. Ten additional patients achieved partial responses following chemotherapy, of which three were subsequently rendered disease free by surgical resection of single areas of residual tumor. Two of these patients are alive and disease free more than 22 months following chemotherapy and one remains relapse free.

The general paucity of relevant exposure data, combined with the limited appreciation by most risk assessors of the critical dimensions and metrics of exposure, often leads to an overreliance on exposure models of questionable validity. The problems of identifying and interpreting relevant metrics of exposure for epidemiologic studies and risk assessments are illustrated through the presentation of three case studies. The first examines the effects of ozone on respiratory mechanical function and demonstrates that the appropriate averaging time is greater than or equal to 6 hr, rather than 1 hr, as is implied by the current ambient air quality standard. The second case study examines the effects of sulfur oxides and particulate matter in ambient air on morbidity and mortality. It indicates that the effects are most closely associated with the acidity of the aerosol, providing a basis for an index of exposure more relevant than those currently used, i.e., sulfur dioxide and nonspecific gravimetric mass concentration of particulate matter. The third case study examines the effects of lead on blood pressure. It shows that blood lead in concentrations below 35 micrograms/dL correlates with blood pressure in both humans and animals independently of other known causal factors for blood pressure elevation. It also examines the variable relations between levels of lead in blood and in environmental media to illustrate the potential problems which can arise from the use of biological markers, such as lead in blood, as indices of exposure.\r"

These registries can help fill a gap that currently exists in the effective handling of problems following the revelation of an exposure situation. In the past, such a tool was lacking and potentially high-risk groups may not have received needed services. Recent legislation, however, has mandated the establishment of exposure registries. These registries can help provide the basis for a unified response to what historically has been described as a fragmented and ineffective approach to managing high-risk cohorts and assessing the impact of toxic substances. Certain exposure registries are now mandated by law (PL 96-510), and they have a place alongside other disease control and public health tools. Their establishment and use is not without problems, but the gain from them could be substantial. They fill a gap in the current public health response to problems of groups found to be at increased risk of exposure to toxic substances.\r"

A retrospective review of 19 such factors in 426 patients identified race, DR match, B + DR match, number of transplants, and preservation time to have a significant influence. The parametric analysis confirmed the effect to be primarily in the early phase, i.e., first 6 months. All patients received cyclosporine with other methods of immunosuppression resulting in an overall 1-year graft survival rate of 66%. The overall 1-year graft survival rate in the white race was 73% and in the black race was 57% (p = 0.002). Allograft survival and DR match showed white recipients with a 1 DR match to have 75% survival at 1 year compared with 57% in the black patient (p = 0.009). If HLA B + DR match was considered, the white recipient allograft survival increased to 76%, 84%, and 88% for 1, 2, and 3 match kidneys by parametric analysis. Patients receiving first grafts had better graft survival (68%) than those undergoing retransplantation (58%) (p = 0.05). Organ preservation less than 12 hours influenced allograft survival with a 78% 1-year survival rate compared with 63% for kidneys with 12-18 hours of preservation. Despite the benefits of B + DR typing, short preservation time, and first transplants to the white recipient, the allograft survival in the black recipient remained uninfluenced by these parameters.\r"

Ingestion of caustics was common and resulted in dense strictures for which complicated and ingenious methods of dilation were advised. Because obstructions usually recurred, by-pass operations were devised with conduits of skin or segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Now, in contrast, when burns occur, intensive steroid therapy usually prevents all but localized areas of stricture. These areas, if short, can be treated with hydrostatic balloon dilation under fluoroscopic control. If longer or resistant to dilation, these strictures can be managed by incision and insertion of a colic patch with excellent long-term results. To a previous series of children who have had esophageal patch with a vascularized segment of colon, now added is an experience with a free segment of small intestine with vascular anastomosis to an artery and vein in the neck and another case of a free patch of pericardium to the esophageal stricture.\r"

Patient demographics were similar in both groups. Ventricular function was assessed preoperatively by radionuclide ventriculography and postoperatively by simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide ventriculographic studies with volume loading. There was no change in ejection fraction (EF) (preoperative versus postoperative value) in Group I (50 +/- 6% versus 53 +/- 6%) but in group II, at similar peak systolic pressure and similar left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), LVEF improved significantly (49 +/- 6% versus 60 +/- 12%, p less than 0.05). Postoperative ventricular function (stroke work index versus EDVI) for the left ventricle and right ventricle were similar in both groups. Evaluation of postoperative LV systolic function (end-systolic blood pressure versus end-systolic volume index) and diastolic function (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure versus EDVI) were also similar in both groups. Retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia is as effective as ARC for intraoperative myocardial protection, and provides excellent postoperative function in patients undergoing elective CABG.\r"

The completed implantation has a tracheal anastomosis securely wrapped in omentum, a left atrial anastomosis posterior to the heart, and a pulmonary artery anastomosis anteriorly. Airway ischemia resulted in the death of 1 patient. This procedure allows complete excision of all diseased pulmonary tissue, retention of the recipient's own heart, and separate excision of the donor heart for use in another recipient, thereby markedly increasing the supply of donor lungs for transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Many special solutions have been developed to protect the ischemic lung in preparation for transplantation. To determine an effective solution, we isolated pulmonary alveolar type II cells from rat lungs. These cells play an important role in sodium transport and the production of surfactant; thus, they are crucial to the respiratory physiology of the lung. In this study, we examined in vitro the effect of various solutions such as Collins' solution, Collins-Sacks solution, and glucose-insulin-potassium solution on alveolar type II cell viability. The cell viability was examined with a trypan blue dye exclusion test and [3H]thymidine uptake proliferation assay after 24 and 72 hours of incubation. The alveolar type II cells in the glucose-insulin-potassium solution had greater viability compared with cells cultured in either Collins' or Collins-Sacks solution. This study demonstrates that glucose-insulin-potassium solution has the least toxic effect on isolated alveolar type II cells compared with other preserving solutions.\r"

Eighteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were studied using a closed cardiac (unvented heart) model. Group 1 patients (no filters) had the highest incidence of gaseous microemboli, as indicated by the ultrasound microemboli index, at both high and low oxygen flow rates. Group 2 patients (40-microns filters) had a significantly lower microemboli index, particularly at low oxygen flow rates (t = 4.9, p less than 0.001). The 25-microns group patients had the lowest values of all. No microemboli were detected at low oxygen flow rates, and microemboli were detected in only 0.1% of the samples at high oxygen flow rates. Additionally, observations on vented hearts in 3 patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery indicate that the origin of gaseous microemboli may be air trapped inside the heart.\r"

Subsequent prospective studies have reported five-year survival following resection in 22 to 83% of patients with Stage I disease and in 0 to 50% of patients with Stages II and III disease. Ten percent of patients with SCLC may be amenable to this approach. Additional patients may become candidates for resection following intensive combination chemotherapy. The optimal postoperative management remains unsettled. Combination chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended following complete resection. Postoperative thoracic irradiation may benefit patients with pathologically involved mediastinal nodes. Correlation of clinical response with our new understanding of the molecular biology of SCLC may further improve our approach to this disease.\r"

Plasma potassium concentration decreased from 4.07 +/- 0.26 mmol/L (4.07 +/- 0.26 mEq/L) to 3.36 +/- 0.44 mmol/L (3.36 +/- 0.44 mEq/L). The average number of premature ventricular contractions, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia episodes did not change significantly. Twenty patients had more than minimal ventricular ectopy (class 2 to 5) before and 17 after diuretic therapy. Further analysis revealed that following diuretic therapy, neither patients with plasma potassium levels of 3.4 mmol/L or less (less than or equal to 3.4 mEq/L) nor patients with left ventricular hypertrophy had increased ectopy as compared with baseline. At baseline, patients with left ventricular hypertrophy had more arrhythmias than patients without. We conclude that the results of this study provide no evidence that diuretic therapy or diuretic-induced hypokalemia results in increased ventricular ectopy, and that patients with left ventricular hypertrophy may have more ventricular ectopy than patients without, but these arrhythmias are not adversely effected by diuretic therapy.\r"

Many of the antihypertensive agents have been shown to elevate total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels or lower the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. Thus, the antihypertensive agents chosen may negate the beneficial effects of a lower blood pressure. Our purpose is to review all available antihypertensive medications and their influence on lipoprotein metabolism. Choosing the antihypertensive therapy least likely to worsen or precipitate other known cardiovascular risk factors is important. Cost and side effect profiles must also be considered in choosing the best antihypertensive regimen for your patients.\r"

Study group characteristics and technical factors were also reviewed. Better conformation with methodologic standards was found than has been reported previously for treadmill exercise testing. Furthermore, study group characteristics and technical factors were better predictors of sensitivity and specificity than were methodologic deficiencies. Only workup bias and test blinding were significantly associated with test accuracy. The percentage of patients with previous myocardial infarction had the highest correlation and was independently and directly related to sensitivity and inversely related to specificity.\r"

Human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity was established for the 68 hemophiliacs by immunofluorescence method or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot testing (for 66 patients). Fifty-one nonsexual contacts and 36 sexual partners of these hemophiliacs were tested for HIV antibody by immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. All sexual partners and all nonsexual household contacts were HIV antibody-negative, including six partners and nine parents of hemophiliacs from whom the virus had been isolated and seven parents and six partners of patients with AIDS. This study further demonstrates lack of transmission of HIV in intimate, but nonsexual settings, and suggests that heterosexual transmission, although well known to occur, may be relatively uncommon in hemophilic couples when the male and female partner have no other risk factors. It is hoped that intensive education and counseling programs will reduce exposure and maintain a low risk of heterosexual transmission.\r"

In the United States, 23,026 patients began long-term dialysis and 6112 (27%) received a kidney transplant. Transplant rates were 31% for men and 21% for women. White patients had a 30% rate and nonwhite patients a 20% rate. Patients less than 11 to 35 years old had an 85% rate vs a 3% rate for those older than 56 years. When race, age, and sex were analyzed together, nonwhite patients aged 21 to 45 years had only half the chance of receiving a transplant compared with white patients of the same age and sex. Women aged 46 to 60 years had less than half the chance of receiving a transplant when compared with men of the same age and race. These data show that there are age, sex, and race imbalances in the distribution of renal transplantation. We believe these imbalances only partially have a morally neutral biological, medical, social, and cultural explanation and that there should be a fairer distribution of kidney transplants.\r"

Untreated patients with OSA had greater urinary flows and greater urinary sodium, chloride, and potassium excretions than did controls. Nasal CPAP treatment in patients with OSA resulted in a reduction in urinary flow and in sodium and chloride excretion, with a concomitant increase in sodium resorption. None of these effects was observed in CPAP-treated normal subjects. The only effect of nasal CPAP common to normal subjects and patients was a trend toward decreased glomerular filtration rate.\r"

Other important stressful aspects of training appear to be those that interfere with social support. Increased anger, not depression, is emerging as the predominant mood change during residency, but the effects of any mood change on patient care have not been studied. Despite growing evidence of the need for change in training programs, especially attention to the affiliative needs of residents, few intervention programs have been reported.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews the current status, including problems and some proposed solutions, of the targeting of cancer with radioactive antibodies for use in antibody imaging (radioimmunodetection) and radioimmunotherapy. The problems and results are similar for purified polyclonal and murine monoclonal antibodies. Foremost among the problems are the low accretion of antibody (0.01% to 0.001% of injected dose per gram) in tumor and the nonspecific deposition of radiometals that are more ideal for imaging or therapy after antibody conjugation. Despite these limitations, radioimmunodetection appears to be a safe and useful method, even at this early stage of development. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 80% to 90% have been achieved in some studies involving radioiodine labels and polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, whereas lower percentages have been achieved with indium 111 or technetium Tc 99m radioconjugates. Even at a usual tumor resolution of 1.5 to 2.0 cm, occult cancers have been disclosed by radioimmunodetection when missed by traditional detection measures, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Radioimmunotherapy is somewhat less developed as a treatment modality, but encouraging remissions have been observed, thus stimulating further active pursuit of this technology. These targeting results have been achieved with antibodies that are not truly cancer specific, but only exploit quantitative differences in antigen expression between tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Circulating target tumor antigens do not appear to prevent successful tumor targeting of the radioactive antibodies.\r"

Our model depicts test results as an r X c matrix, with r possible test results and c possible clinical states. Analysis of this matrix is based on the Ri/Cj ratio, calculated as a number of subjects having a specified result Ri within a given clinical state Cj, divided by total subjects within this clinical state. From this model, we can identify three special cases: (1) a 2 X c matrix, with two possible test results of T+ or T-, over c possible clinical states; (2) an r X 2 matrix, with r possible test results, over two possible clinical states of D+ or D-; and (3) a 2 X 2 matrix, with two possible test results over two possible clinical states. Application of the Ri/Cj ratio to the r X c matrix provides a useful approach to graphic analysis of multiple test results over multiple clinical states. The Ri/Cj ratio also provides a general approach to Bayesian analysis, in which likelihood ratio, relative operating characteristic analysis, sensitivity, and specificity represent special cases or special applications.\r"

Cytokeratin immunoreactivity was found in 14 of 33, and EMA in 20 of 33 LMS, usually in a large number of tumor cells. One case was confirmed as cytokeratin-positive in frozen sections with four different monoclonal antibodies. These results show that immunoreactivity for epithelial markers can be present in pure smooth-muscle sarcomas. Thus, such immunoreactivity cannot be regarded as a specific feature of carcinomas, synovial sarcoma, or epithelioid sarcoma, which are already known to be cytokeratin- and EMA-positive.\r"

Wilms' tumor is known to produce mucin identifiable in serum, urine, and touch imprints. To our knowledge, circulating mucin has not been described in nephroblastomatosis. When patients' blood was mixed with lysing reagent in the Ortho ELT-800, mucin was precipitated by acetic acid; this was confirmed by microscopy. Precipitates were counted as nuclei, producing abnormal WBC counts and histograms. When measured by the Ortho ELT-8/ws using osmotic lysis, the WBC counts matched hemocytometer counts. Mucin was not seen on Wright-stained smears but was evident with alcian blue staining and was largely abolished by hyaluronidase. Treatment led to disappearance of the artifactual WBC elevation.\r"

These two therapeutic modalities were tested alone and in combination in a prospective, controlled, randomized trial. The authors hypothesized that in concurrent use, these two modalities would complement one another. Thirty-six hemiplegic patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke were accepted for study and randomized into four groups to receive either control, FES, BFB, or combined therapies. Each patient received 30 minutes of treatment three times per week for six weeks, in addition to their general rehabilitation program. Quantitative gait analysis was performed biweekly on each subject during the experimental therapy and for four weeks afterward. Thirty-two subjects completed the study. Combined therapy with BFB and FES resulted in improvements in both knee and ankle minimum flexion angles during swing phase that were statistically significant with p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively. Velocity of gait, cycle time, and symmetry of stance phases also improved. The length of time elapsed since the stroke did not prove to be a significant factor.\r"

Nonmusculoskeletal \"systemic\" symptoms, eg, fatigue, poor sleep, irritable bowel symptoms, and chronic headaches, are also common. Although PFS is similar to myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in that both conditions cause muscle pain and tenderness, important differences exist. Unlike PFS, muscle pain in MPS is usually local or regional, accompanied by trigger points. Unlike tender points, trigger points produce a referral pain pattern specific to each muscle. Moreover, \"systemic\" features of PFS are usually absent in MPS. Common and important pathologic changes in muscle in PFS are moth-eaten appearance of Type I fiber by histochemistry, and myofibrillar lysis with glycogen and mitochondria deposition by electron microscopy; inflammatory changes are absent by light microscopy. Recent investigations have shown that PFS is a characteristic clinical entity. Further controlled studies are, however, essential to establish the pathologic changes in tender muscles in PFS.\r"

Since the time of the last report (at a mean of 29 months), the mean dosage of MTX has increased from 12.4 mg/week to 14.6 mg/week, whereas the mean prednisone dosage has decreased from a baseline of 7.1 mg/day to 1.9 mg/day. A significant improvement from baseline in all clinical parameters tested was maintained, and response to therapy did not vary significantly between the assessment at 29 months and that at 53 months. Toxic reactions were as common during months 30-53 as during the first 29 months of the study, with patterns of toxic reactions remaining consistent within each patient. Radiologic evidence of disease progression was not seen before 24 months of MTX treatment, but after this time, it was observed in some patients. We conclude that many clinical features of long-term MTX therapy are distinctly different from what might have been expected after the short-term trials.\r"

The other 3 stopped therapy because of lack of response or because of side effects. Improvements were noted within 3 months in responding patients. These promising observations suggest that controlled studies of MTX for the treatment of SLE are justified.\r"

Immunofluorescent staining for HLA-DR showed dermal positivity in 12 of 13 involved- and 9 of 13 uninvolved-skin biopsy specimens from scleroderma patients, compared with only 1 of 10 controls. By immunoperoxidase staining, most of the DR positivity was found in fibroblast-like cells. These findings further support the notion of immunologic dysfunction in scleroderma.\r"

  ".W": "The functional impairment due to spasticity must be carefully assessed before any treatment is considered. Therapeutic intervention is best individualized to a particular patient. Basic principles of treatment to ameliorate spastic hypertonia are: 1) avoid noxious stimuli and 2) provide frequent range of motion. Therapeutic exercise, cold or topical anesthesia may decrease reflex activity for short periods of time in order to facilitate minimal motor function. Casting and splinting techniques are extremely valuable to extend joint range diminished by hypertonicity. Baclofen, diazepam and dantrolene remain the three most commonly used pharmacologic agents in the treatment of spastic hypertonia. Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while sodium dantrolene is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. Phenytoin with chlorpromazine may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. Tizanidine and ketazolam, not yet available in the United States, may be significant additions to the pharmacologic armamentarium. Intrathecal administration of antispastic medications allows high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects. This form of treatment is the most exciting recent development in the treatment of spastic hypertonia. Peripheral electrical stimulation may have limited use in diminishing tone and facilitating paretic muscles. Dorsal column stimulation via electrodes within the spinal column was initially hailed as a therapeutic advance, but has subsequently been shown to be minimally effective. Phenol injections provide a valuable transition between short-term and long-term treatments and offer remediation of hypertonia in selected muscle groups. Tenotomies and tendon transfers offer significant benefit in carefully chosen patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dramatic improvement in survival and the quality of life of cardiac transplant recipients reflects many factors including refined criteria for patient and donor selection, as well as the clinical introduction of cyclosporine. Current contraindications to the procedure include: 1) age greater than 65 years, 2) active infection, 3) active malignant neoplastic disease, 4) recent pulmonary embolus or infarction, 5) irreversible renal or hepatic failure, and 6) fixed elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. The introduction of cyclosporine has been accompanied by an increase in the 1 year survival. While the use of cyclosporine has not decreased the incidence of rejection episodes, it has dramatically decreased their severity. In addition, the incidence and severity of infectious complications, as well as the length of hospitalization, have been decreased with the introduction of cyclosporine. Despite the progress made, several problems remain in the management of transplant recipients. Chronic cyclosporine therapy has been associated with a disturbingly high incidence of hypertension and renal impairment, and a low, yet significant, incidence of malignant neoplasms. However, the most significant obstacle to successful clinical cardiac transplantation is the scarcity of donor organs. Many centers now report that the mortality rate for patients awaiting transplantation exceeds the mortality associated with the procedure itself. Donor scarcity has led to renewed interest in the development of mechanical cardiac devices and investigation into cross-species transplantation (xenotransplantation).\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the mechanisms by which topical corticosteroids modulate cutaneous immune reactions in man. Volunteers applied clobetasone butyrate 0.05% (Eumovate; EV), betamethasone valerate 0.1% (Betnovate; BV), clobetasol propionate 0.05% (Dermovate; DV), and control vehicles twice daily to forearm skin for 7 days. Steroid therapy significantly decreased the number of HLA-DR/T6 (CD1a) positive Langerhans cells (LCs) per mm2 in suction blister-derived epidermal sheets, expressed as a mean percentage of controls, as follows: EV 69.2%; BV 67.3%; DV 37.8%. LC antigen presenting capacity was determined in the allogeneic and autologous epidermal cell-lymphocyte reactions. The LC-dependent allostimulatory capacity of epidermal cells, expressed as a mean percentage of controls, was also significantly reduced by steroid therapy: EV 45.1%; BV 41.9%; DV 23.4%. Following therapy with clobetasol propionate 0.05%, the capacity of epidermal cells to present tetanus toxoid to, and to augment concanavalin A mediated lymphocyte stimulation of, autologous lymphocytes was reduced to 33.6% and 19.7% respectively of controls. Depression of epidermal cell allostimulatory capacity was not the result of a steroid-induced decrease in the production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF)/interleukin 1 by keratinocytes, since it could not be reversed by addition of exogenous interleukin 1. Indomethacin, added to block any potential prostaglandin synthesis during the culture period, did not restore the allostimulatory capacity of epidermal cells from steroid-treated sites. Addition of epidermal cells from DV-treated sites depressed the capacity of control epidermal cells to stimulate lymphocytes in the allogeneic epidermal-lymphocyte reaction. Our results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory action of topical corticosteroids in man is associated not only with a reduction in the number of HLA-DR/T6 positive LCs, but also with a marked decrease in Langerhans cell-dependent T lymphocyte activation. The effects of the different steroids on both of these parameters correlated with their potency as determined in the standard occlusive vasoconstrictor assay. Topical corticosteroids are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, and inhibit not only the elicitation phase, but also the induction phase, of allergic contact dermatitis reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Electron microscopy revealed similar features to those previously described in adenoid cystic carcinomas of salivary gland origin: wide intercellular spaces, pseudocysts containing replicated basement membrane-like material and true lumina lined by cytoplasmic membranes with numerous microvilli. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to several cytoskeletal proteins (keratins and actin) indicated the presence of two epithelial tumour cell populations, one with the phenotype of myoepithelial cells, lining the pseudocysts and the periphery of the tumour fields, and another with the phenotype of acinar cells of the secretory coil of sweat glands. In addition, the tumour showed immunoreactivity for epithelial membrane antigen, but not carcinoembryonic antigen. A review of the literature on other cases of primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma showed that this tumour generally affects older patients with a female to male ratio of 4:1. The most common tumour site appears to be the scalp (40%), and the recurrence rate is 50%. Surgical treatment with extensive resection margins is recommended.\r"

At least some of these may be the result of an inherited disorder. On available data inheritance is most likely autosomal dominant with partial expressivity or incomplete penetrance. This report describes two more families each of which have two members with uveal melanomas.\r"

The 14C DNA Farr assay was the most sensitive and specific assay (SLE, 57% positive, controls, 0%). A commercial 125I DNA Farr assay was significantly less sensitive (SLE, 39% positive). The fluorescence human chromosomal preparation assay was as sensitive as the 14C DNA Farr assay (SLE, 58% positive) but less specific (controls, 8% positive). The immunofluorescence Crithidia luciliae assay was specific, but less sensitive (SLE, 37% positive) than the 14C DNA Farr assay. Adaptation of Crithidia to immunoperoxidase did not alter its sensitivity or performance. These results confirm that the 14C DNA Farr assay, locally refined and performed by experienced hands, is the most sensitive and specific assay for anti-DNA antibodies. The 125I DNA Farr was no more sensitive than the Crithidia assay but considerably more laborious. The human chromosomal preparation may be suitable as a rapid screening test for anti-DNA antibodies.\r"

Laboratory measurements showed no significant change in any group. Significantly more patients in the 1 g group felt the treatment worthwhile than in the other groups. The drop-out rates in the 40 mg and 500 mg groups differed significantly from that seen in the 1 g group and were such that statistical analysis beyond 3 weeks was difficult to interpret. Side-effects were mild. Three patients subsequently developed avascular necrosis, one in the 1 g and two in the 40 mg groups. The study suggests that single doses of MP below 1 g are not helpful in the management of acute RA.\r"

The predominant pathological process is opportunistic infection secondary to the decrease of T-helper (T4) cells and includes toxoplasmosis, encephalitis due to cytomegalovirus and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. On the other hand, mycoses (mainly cryptococcosis) are relatively uncommon. Primary lymphomas are three times more common than secondary lymphoma spreading from other sites. Cerebral involvement by Kaposi sarcoma is metastatic, probably from primary foci in the lungs. Lesions due to the direct involvement of the nervous system by the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) include subacute encephalitis and vacuolar myelopathy. The former is reported with increasing frequency and is localized predominantly to the white matter in which multinucleated giant cells can be found. These are considered typical of AIDS and have been shown to contain HIV particles in their cytoplasm. AIDS lesions due to infectious agents do not always conform to the typical pattern of the uncomplicated disease and not uncommonly there is evidence of more than one infectious agent in the same area. Peripheral nervous system lesions in HIV infections, responsible for a variety of clinical symptoms, usually appear, in biopsy material, as nonspecific inflammatory in type. CMV inclusions and lymphomatous infiltrations of peripheral nerve have been reported in autopsy cases.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal and neonatal infections can occur at different times during pregnancy, from conception to birth. Infections that take place near the time of conception often destroy the zygote or embryo and only rarely leave definitive evidence. The mother can transmit the infection to her fetus through several routes, but the most likely routes are through ascending infections and through the blood. The inability of most agents to infect the early embryo probably depends largely on local barriers to the infectious agent, such as the zona pellucida. Some viruses, however, because of their systems for gene regulation of expression, can infect only embryos of certain developmental stages. Certain retroviruses can infect embryos, integrate into cellular DNA, and become part of the germline. After implantation, most infectious agents reach the fetus hematogenously. Organisms circulating in the mother reach and infect the placenta. They then may breach the placenta, gain access to the fetal circulation, and disseminate through the fetal body. Agents with particular tropisms infect particular organs and cause particular symptom complexes. The damage done by the organisms depends largely on the gestational age of the fetus at the time of the infection. The ability of the agent to infect or damage the fetus at all often depends on whether the mother is experiencing a primary infection or has previously mounted an effective immune response. Agents harm the fetus through direct destruction of parenchymal cells, through destruction of blood vessels and resulting infarction, through continued replication in fetal and neonatal tissues, through altering the growth parameters of various fetal tissues, and through provoking autoimmune responses. Infections that begin in the perinatal period usually infect the fetus by direct inoculation from infected foci in the birth canal or through direct contact with large amounts of infected maternal body fluids. Direct tissue destruction of the immediate sequelae of invasive infections usually causes the fetal damage from these perinatally acquired agents. The clinical features of the disease that begin in this period provide an opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention. Understanding the routes of fetal infection and the mechanisms underlying fetal damage from infection will help in devising strategies for preventing and treating congenital infections.\r"

Most of these infections, however, are not associated with significant maternal or neonatal disease. Conversely, as many as 65 per cent of women who give birth to infants with proven enteroviral infection have symptomatic disease during the perinatal period. Maternal echovirus or coxsackievirus B infections are not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, but stillbirths late in pregnancy have been described. Although a slightly increased risk for congenital heart defects and urogenital anomalies has been reported for the offspring of women who seroconverted to the group B coxsackievirus during pregnancy, these data are highly tentative. Transmission of enteroviruses from mother to infant is relatively common (30-50 per cent) and may occur through contact with maternal secretions during vaginal delivery, blood, or upper respiratory tract secretions. Intrauterine transmission has been documented, but its frequency is unknown. Postnatal transmission from maternal or nonmaternal sources also occurs regularly. Neonatal disease may range from inapparent infection to overwhelming systemic illness and death. Common clinical syndromes associated with neonatal enteroviral infections are meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, myocarditis, and hepatitis. The severity and outcome of perinatally acquired enteroviral infection is influenced by several factors, including the virus strain involved, mode of transmission, and presence of passively acquired serotype-specific maternal antibody. Newborn nursery outbreaks of nonpolio enteroviral infections usually coincide with seasonal peaks of enteroviral disease in the community. These outbreaks have been due mostly to echovirus 11 or group B coxsackievirus serotypes 1 to 5 and are associated with attack rates of up to 50 per cent.\r"

As many as 20 per cent of women in the reproductive age group in the United States continue to be susceptible to rubella despite the immunization programs currently in place. Intensified efforts are therefore needed to identify persons at risk for infection and to vaccinate them. Women who develop a rubella-like illness during pregnancy should have the diagnosis confirmed serologically because a diagnosis based on clinical criteria alone is unreliable and because of the serious implications of gestational rubella infection. The rubella virus can infect the fetus at any stage of pregnancy, but defects are rarely noted when this occurs after the 16th week of gestation. The most common abnormalities in the congenital rubella syndrome are hearing loss, mental retardation, cardiac malformations, and eye defects. Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, glaucoma, and other delayed manifestations of congenital rubella syndrome are common, thereby necessitating long-term followup of these patients. The detection of rubella-specific IgM antibodies in fetal blood is helpful in establishing the diagnosis prenatally and can aid in the management of pregnancies complicated by this infection. Susceptible women identified through screening during pregnancy should be immunized in the immediate postpartum or postabortion period. Although the live, attenuated rubella vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy, pregnant women who are inadvertently immunized are not candidates for pregnancy termination because no defects consistent with congenital rubella have been reported to date in the offspring of other similarly vaccinated women.\r"

We found 10 articles that reported 11 randomized control trials published between 1960 and 1970. Three trials found a statistically significant benefit for the drug vs placebo, four showed a positive trend, two found no difference, and two showed a slight trend favoring placebo. When the results of all 11 trials were combined, two different statistical methods showed a statistically significant benefit from the drug. These combined results must be interpreted cautiously because of excluded patients and other methodologic variations in the studies, as well as evidence from other studies that dipyridamole may aggravate angina. Nevertheless, we conclude that there is some evidence for efficacy of the drug and believe the question should be restudied in larger and better-designed trials.\r"

This study examined the hemodynamic and hormonal responses to initial low- and higher dose converting-enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril or captopril) at rest compared with the response during subsequent chronic therapy while treadmill exercise testing was performed in nine patients with chronic heart failure. At rest, similar changes in systemic arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration were found with initial low and higher doses. However, after at least 4 weeks of therapy, dose-dependent increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in plasma aldosterone concentration were noted during exercise without significant differences in exercise systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. This discrepancy suggests that initial low-dose converting enzyme inhibition does completely block the enzyme, but higher dose therapy is required for complete blockade during subsequent exercise in chronic heart failure.\r"

Twenty-one patients were women and 12 were men, ranging in age from 30 to 69 years (mean, 48 years). Twenty patients (61 percent) presented with symptomatic perianal disease, while 13 patients (39 percent) were noted as having perianal Bowen's disease upon pathologic examination of routine hemorrhoidectomy specimens. Ten of the patients (30 percent) had prior histories of unrelated cancer. Twenty-seven patients were managed by wide local excision, three patients by simple excision, three patients by fulguration, and one patient by an abdominoperineal resection. During a follow-up period averaging 3.7 years (range, 0.3 to 10 years), one patient developed a new invasive skin cancer while a second patient experienced a recurrence of perianal Bowen's disease. The characteristic gross appearance of this lesion and its failure to respond to conventional therapy should prompt the performance of a biopsy, which readily establishes the diagnosis. This experience confirms that wide local excision is adequate therapy for perianal Bowen's disease and that close clinical follow-up is necessary to identify disease recurrence or the development of a malignancy.\r"

The carcinoids and rectal carcinomas extensively expressed blood-group substance A, B, and H, Lewis B antigen, and difucosylated carbohydrate antigens (DFCA). Thus, rectal carcinoids and adenocarcinomas possess both similar and different tumor antigen profiles. The occurrence of discrepant antigen determinants may be used in the differential diagnosis of these two types of tumors. The coexpression of blood-group substance A, B, and H, Lewis B antigen, and DFCA is consistent with the opinion that both rectal carcinomas and carcinoids have a common entoderm origin, but carcinoids are considered to rise from the endocrine-differentiated and the adenocarcinomas from the nonendocrine-differentiated enterocytes.\r"

The presence of undefined bacterial metabolites in the colonic lumen causing specific breakdown of fatty acid oxidation in colonic epithelial cells is proposed to be the initiating event of the disease process that leads to an immune response and eicosanoid response perpetuating epithelial cell damage. The proposals embody the thesis that primary metabolic damage to colonocytes determines the clinical and pathologic manifestations of ulcerative colitis.\r"

IgA liver membrane antibodies were detected in 58% of patients with alcoholic liver disease, whereas they were detected only in 21% of those with nonalcoholic liver disease, except for cases of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, IgA liver membrane antibodies were detected at a high frequency in a group of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and active cirrhosis (94%) as compared with that of fatty liver, hepatic fibrosis, and inactive cirrhosis (42%). These results suggest that alcoholic liver disease is characterized in part by a humoral immune response of IgA liver membrane antibodies.\r"

Although the identity of the positive modulator is uncertain, the negative modulator appears to be prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), because 1) glucose stimulates PGE2 synthesis from islet cells; 2) exogenous PGE2 inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion; 3) inhibition of beta-cell PGE2 synthesis increases glucose-induced insulin secretion, and this increase is reversed by exogenous PGE2; and 4) PGE2 binds to specific beta-cell receptors that are coupled to inhibitory regulatory components of adenylate cyclase whose activation decreases cAMP levels. Other possible regulatory effects of eicosanoids on islet function include modulation of islet blood flow and its immune responsiveness. From these considerations, the perspective is offered that eicosanoids are pluripotential modulators of islet function.\r"

  ".W": "Although the hereditary nature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is well recognized, the nature of the predisposing defect remains elusive. Individuals with a history of gestational diabetes had shown a reduced insulin-sensitivity index (S1) in the absence of fasting hyperglycemia. To determine whether this finding could result from an inherited defect of the insulin receptor, an NIDDM pedigree was ascertained through a former gestational-diabetic proband. The proband, her siblings, and her first cousins were clinically characterized for insulin sensitivity with the minimal-model-based S1 from a modified glucose tolerance test. Islet function was characterized by the incremental insulin response to 5 g i.v. arginine at baseline and at a plasma glucose level of 500-600 mg/dl. Genetic studies included linkage analyses for the insulin gene and the insulin-receptor gene with DNA polymorphisms (restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, RFLPs) previously described. The pattern of inheritance in this large pedigree appeared to follow autosomal-dominant transmission. No defect in islet function was found, but as a group, third-generation family members had an S1 that was significantly lower than that of weight-matched control individuals, suggesting an inherited defect in insulin action. Genetic studies showed no sharing of insulin gene, insulin-receptor-gene alleles among the diabetic individuals, or insulin-receptor alleles among third-generation individuals with insulin insensitivity. The genetic analyses thus suggest that this pedigree has an inherited defect that is not linked to the insulin gene or the insulin-receptor gene. The diminished S1 may nonetheless suggest an inherited defect in insulin action.\r"

Plasma glucose and HbA1c were normalized, demonstrating the effectiveness of our intensive treatment program. Plasma lipoprotein profiles and LDL apolipoprotein B kinetic parameters were estimated during conventional and then during intensive therapy for each patient. Intensive therapy resulted in a significant reduction of plasma and LDL cholesterol and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The lower LDL levels resulted from a decreased production of lipoprotein rather than an increased fractional catabolic rate. These results are consistent with our previous observations of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism during intensive therapy. VLDL production is significantly reduced; thus, a decreased production of LDL supports the contention that intensive therapy with insulin in normolipemic type I diabetic patients reduces the production of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B rather than increasing the clearance, and therapy also increases HDL cholesterol. Both of these effects may be beneficial in reducing the risk for coronary heart disease in type I diabetes.\r"

After 4 wk on the diet, the cp/cp rats weigh significantly more than their +/? controls, have postprandial hyperglycemia (greater than 400 mg/dl), and are hyperinsulinemic, with immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels 10- to 20-fold greater than controls. Total pancreatic IRI tends to be increased 1.6-fold in the cp/cp rats (although not significantly). There is no increase in pancreatic proinsulin content as a percent of total IRI. Studies of in vitro pancreatic function were carried out with the isolated nonrecirculating perfused pancreas method. The cp/cp rats (n = 10) showed impaired or absent IRI responses to 16.5 mM glucose, whereas +/? rats (n = 9) responded with classic biphasic curves. Comparison of insulin secreted in 20 min revealed a greater than 53% decrease in IRI secretion in cp/cp rats (P less than .05). A paradoxical hypersecretion of IRI at glucose concentrations of 0-2.7 mM was noted in cp/cp but not lean rats, i.e., 1.8 +/- 0.2 mU/min IRI in cp/cp rats vs. 0.04 +/- 0.007 mU/min in +/? rats. Perfusion of pancreases for 45 min with buffers containing no glucose resulted in restoration of a normal biphasic IRI response to 16.5 mM glucose in the cp/cp rats, whereas response in the lean rats was markedly reduced. Brisk IRI responses to 10 mM arginine in buffers with no glucose also occurred in cp/cp but not +/? rats. Glucagon secretion was relatively suppressed in the cp/cp rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The average volume and average insulin content of the final islet preparation were 348 mm3 and 93.4 U, respectively. The islets were morphologically intact with a normal degree of beta-granulation and responded to glucose stimulation with a fivefold increase of insulin secretion over basal levels. The procedure is now being used for the initiation of the second phase of clinical trials on human islet transplants.\r"

Conversely, studies concerning the effect of insulin on glucose transport (estimated by facilitated diffusion of 2-deoxyglucose) or glycogen synthesis (estimated by incorporation of glucose into cellular glycogen) revealed the presence of heterogeneous alterations among the different patient cell lines. However, although the nature of the defect(s) varied among the patients, alterations in glucose metabolism were present in all cases.

We have challenged the issue by studying in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats the short- and long-term effect of selective sialoadenectomy on the animals' ability to meet an intra-arterial glucose challenge. Ten-minute intra-arterial glucose tolerance tests were carried out in chronically catheterized adult rats before and after sialoadenectomy. Eighty-five to 100 days postsurgery, the parotidectomized rats experienced a 45% reduction in plasma immunoreactive insulin output (P less than .001) compared with the sham-operated animals; the plasma glucose levels of the test subjects remained 19% higher (P less than .001) than those of the control group. In younger rats, similar observations were made; however, the difference in insulin and glucose responses between treatments was less than in the adult rats. Our findings suggest that the insulinotropic effect resides primarily with the parotids, and the role of the submandibular glands seems to be permissive at best. We hypothesize that parotidectomy deprives the beta-cells of a humoral principle that appears to be essential for optimizing the immediate insulin response to a glucose challenge. These results suggest that the insulinotropic effect of the parotids is of particular importance when aging changes insulin secretion and action.\r"

In contrast, CSII patients retained their VPT and HRV. Comparison of nerve function alterations during the 2-yr trial showed better preservation in CSII than in CIT patients of VPT in the great toe (0.8 +/- 1.7 vs. -1.4 +/- 1.9 V, P less than .01) and the medial malleolus (1.5 +/- 2.9 vs. -1.4 +/- 1.8 V, P less than .05) and of HRV at rest (10 +/- 24 vs. -13 +/- 22 ms, P less than .05) and at standing (-0.01 +/- 0.13 vs. -0.15 +/- 0.16 ms, P less than .05). We conclude that intensified glycemic control can favorably influence parasympathetic and somatosensory nerve function in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "A high-affinity macrophage receptor has been shown to mediate the removal of proteins modified by advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation end products (AGEs) in both animals and humans. To characterize the effect of diabetes on this receptor system, resident peritoneal macrophages from experimentally induced and genetically diabetic mice were studied. Binding and degradation of radioiodinated AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) were determined from saturation kinetics and compared with glucose and insulin levels of each subgroup. Scatchard plot analysis of nondiabetic mouse macrophages has indicated 1.5 X 10(5) receptors/cell, with a binding affinity of 1.7 X 10(7) M-1. The in vitro exposure of macrophages to either elevated glucose or insulin concentrations failed to demonstrate a short-term regulatory effect on AGE-receptor function. However, macrophages from hypoinsulinemic alloxan-induced diabetic mice indicated a two- to threefold increase in AGE-receptor number per cell (2.98 +/- 0.25 X 10(5)/cell), and macrophages from C57BL/KsJ (db/db) mice showed an almost threefold greater receptor number (2.86 +/- 0.2 X 10(5)/cell), with binding affinity remaining essentially unchanged (1.24 +/- 0.05 X 10(7) and 1.21 +/- 0.07 X 10(7) M-1, respectively). In addition, a moderate increase (25-30%) of 125I-labeled AGE-BSA degradation was observed in these two insulin-deficient diabetic macrophage groups compared with the normal control group. In contrast, macrophages from hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic C57BL/6J (db/db) mice demonstrated a distinct reduction in both AGE-receptor number (0.67 +/- 0.03 X 10(5)/cell) and binding affinity (0.37 +/- 0.03 X 10(7) M-1), with a decrease of AGE-BSA degradation of approximately 50% compared with the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MoAbs from the parental myeloma cell line and purified immunoglobulins (Igs) from different animal species were controls. Type I diabetic sera showed significantly increased binding to MoAb.ISL-coated wells compared with normal subjects (P less than .001). However, the same sera also tended to show a higher binding to the control (non-islet-related) MoAb. Sera from type I diabetic patients also reacted with horse, bovine, pig, rabbit, and goat IgG. Displacement of the binding has been obtained by F(ab')2 and/or Fc fragments of IgG. Evidence has been obtained regarding a similar reaction with human IgM. All the sera were negative when tested for rheumatoid factor by nephelometry. The circulating antibodies described have been proven to be different from islet cell autoantibodies. An anti-Ig antibody is thus present in the sera of recent-onset diabetic patients and represents an additional immunological phenomenon with possible physiopathological and clinical significance.\r"

There were three separate experiments, and the baseline for each consisted of control and age-matched rats with 3 wk of untreated streptozocin-induced diabetes. We compared the effects of twice-daily insulin treatment, daily sorbinil (25 mg.kg-1.day-1 p.o.), and a combination of both treatments. In untreated diabetic rats the anterograde accumulation of SPLI was reduced by 30-40%. This deficit was unaffected by sorbinil alone but was attenuated by insulin and prevented completely by insulin and sorbinil combined. There were also indications that diabetes caused reductions in retrograde accumulation of SPLI and its content in unconstricted nerve and the L4 dorsal root ganglion. The fraction of SPLI undergoing net anterograde or retrograde movement and the velocities of accumulation were unaffected by diabetes or the treatment regimens. These findings indicate a reduction in the amount of substance P moved by axonal transport in diabetic rats that is related partly to aldose reductase activity and partly to some other insulin-correctable consequence of experimental diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acutely reduced weight bearing (unloading) on the in vitro uptake of 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-D-glucose was studied in the soleus muscle by tail casting and suspending rats. After just 4 h, the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose fell (-19%, P less than 0.01) and declined further after an additional 20 h of unloading. This diminution at 24 h was associated with slower oxidation of [14C]glucose and incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen. Unlike after 1 day, at 3 days of unloading basal uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose did not differ from control. Reloading of the soleus after 1 or 3 days of unloading increased uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose above control and returned it to normal within 6 h and 4 days, respectively. These effects of unloading and recovery were caused by local changes in the soleus, because the extensor digitorum longus from the same hindlimbs did not display any alterations in uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose or metabolism of glucose. This study demonstrates that alterations in contractile activity, brought about by unloading or recovery from unloading, can influence the regulation of glucose transport in the soleus.\r"

To define its activity on human airways we have studied the effects of doubling concentrations of inhaled PGI2 and its hydrolysis product 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) on specific airway conductance (sGaw), maximum expiratory flow at 30% vital capacity (Vmax30), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and static lung volumes in subjects with mild allergic asthma. In a second study the effect of inhaled PGI2 on bronchoconstriction provoked by increasing concentrations of inhaled prostaglandin (PG) D2 and methacholine was observed. Inhalation of PGI2 up to a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml had no significant effect on sGaw but produced a concentration-related decrease in FEV1 and Vmax30 in all subjects. In two of four subjects inhalation of PGI2 also increased residual volume and decreased vital capacity but had no effect on total lung capacity. PGI2, but not 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, protected against bronchoconstriction provoked by either PGD2 or methacholine whether airway caliber was measured as sGaw, FEV1, or Vmax30. The apparent disparity between the bronchoconstrictor and antibronchoconstrictor effects of PGI2 might be explained by its potent vasodilator effect in causing airway narrowing through mucosal engorgement and reducing the spasmogenic effects of other inhaled mediators by increasing their clearance from the airways.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether prior exercise affects the pathways of liver and muscle glycogen synthesis, rested and postexercised rats fasted for 24 h were infused with glucose (200 mumol.min-1.kg-1 iv) containing [6-3H]glucose. Hyperglycemia was exaggerated in postexercised rats, but blood lactate levels were lower than in nonexercised rats. The percent of hepatic glycogen synthesized from the indirect pathway (via gluconeogenesis) did not differ between exercised (39%) and nonexercised (36%) rats. In red muscle, glycogen was synthesized entirely by the direct pathway (uptake and phosphorylation of plasma glucose) in both groups. However, only approximately 50% of glycogen was formed via the direct pathway in white muscle of exercised and nonexercised rats. Therefore prior exercise did not alter the pathways of tissue glycogen synthesis. To further study the incorporation of gluconeogenic precursors into muscle glycogen, exercised rats were infused with either saline, lactate (100 mumol.min-1.kg-1), or glucose (200 mumol.min-1.kg-1), containing [6-3H]glucose and [14C(U)]lactate. Plasma glucose was elevated one- to twofold and three- to fourfold by lactate and glucose infusion, respectively. Plasma lactate levels were elevated by about threefold during both glucose and lactate infusion. Glycogen was partially synthesized via an indirect pathway in white muscle and liver of glucose- or lactate-infused rats but not in saline-infused animals. Thus participation of an indirect pathway in white skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis required prolonged elevation of plasma lactate levels produced by nutritive support.\r"

Vital capacity, expiratory flow, airway responsiveness to methacholine, and respiratory symptoms were measured at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h while subjects breathed O2 and 12 h afterwards. After 12 h, forced vital capacity was significantly decreased with O2 breathing but not with air breathing. At 4, 8, or 12 h of exposure and 12 h after exposure, there was no difference in methacholine sensitivity or reactivity between O2 and air-exposure trials. The earliest manifestations of pulmonary normobaric O2 toxicity in normal adults include diminished vital capacity and the onset of respiratory symptoms, but early O2 toxicity does not produce altered responsiveness to inhaled methacholine.\r"

  ".W": "During a 9 year period between January 1977 and December 1985, 98 consecutive infants under 3 months of age underwent surgical repair of symptomatic aortic coarctation. Resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 73, subclavian flap angioplasty in 14, and other procedures in 11 patients. There were 20 (20.5%) early and 12 (12.5%) late deaths. No early deaths occurred in the isolated coarctation group. Associated complex cardiac malformations and age under 2 weeks at operation influenced significantly early and late outcome but not any particular surgical procedure. The survivors were followed from 6 months to 8 years and 8 months postoperatively. There were 16 (28%) re-coarctations among 56 survivors after end-to-end anastomosis requiring re-operation in 7 (12%) infants and 3 (30%) re-coarctations among 10 survivors after subclavian flap angioplasty requiring re-operation in 1 infant. After end-to-end anastomosis re-coarctation as well as re-operation rate was markedly lower when an interrupted suture line for the entire anastomosis was used as compared to the group with a continuous suture line of the posterior aortic wall (21% vs. 33% re-coarctation rate and 4% vs. 18% re-operation rate respectively). From our results it is concluded that subclavian flap angioplasty for relief of aortic coarctation in early infancy is not superior to resection and end-to-end anastomosis. In the end-to-end anastomosis group an interrupted suture line has a lower re-coarctation as well as re-operation rate as compared to a continuous suture line of the posterior aortic wall.\r"

In aortoiliac occlusive disease and with end-to-side proximal and distal anastomoses, simple removal of the infected graft will not threaten the viability of the limb. Complicated and often incomplete extra-anatomical revascularisation is therefore not necessary and consequently operative time and risk are reduced. Close pre- and postoperative monitoring of the peripheral circulation and painstaking decubitus prophylaxis are mandatory. After 3 to 6 months \"in situ\" bypass can be performed to correct claudication. Three patients that have been successfully treated according to this philosophy are presented.\r"

The mechanism of injury included major arterial avulsions sustained during cancer operations at the base of the neck (2), blunt injuries secondary to motor vehicle accidents (2), stab wounds (1), and gunshot wounds (4). The vessels injured included the right subclavian artery (2), the innominate artery (1), and the left subclavian artery (6). Associated major venous injuries were seen in 4 cases (44%) and major non-vascular injuries in 5 cases (55%). Arterial exposure involved a variety of incisions, including left thoracotomy, median sternotomy, clavicular resection, or a combination of these. Arterial continuity was restored in all cases using primary repair (2), autogenous saphenous vein graft (6), or prosthetic graft (1). Venous injuries were treated by ligation (2) or lateral venorraphy (2). One patient died unexpectedly on the tenth postoperative day for an overall mortality of 11 percent. Three of the 8 survivors sustained nonfatal complications (38%). All 8 survivors had patent arterial repairs at the time of hospital discharge, and 5 of 8 survivors were available for follow-up with intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA), revealing arterial repair patency in all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with a patent renal artery on angiogram but without normalization of blood pressure showed an improvement of parameters such as effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration fraction and tubular transport time, whereas the perfusion index remained unchanged. In the group with re-stenosis or re-occlusion all parameters deteriorated after surgery. Discriminant analysis of preoperative data showed that success of surgery could be predicted with high degree of certainty (65% for improvement and 92% for no improvement). The results indicate, that radionuclide methods and arteriography are complementary in the evaluation of the hemodynamic consequences of a renal artery stenosis.

It was the purpose of our study to determine the efficacy of a screening program for peripheral vascular disease and carotid artery disease using the noninvasive laboratory diagnostic tools. In the screening for peripheral disease, there were 496 participants with a mean age of 35 (range 17 to 63) years. All participants had an ankle:brachial index (ABI) of 0.95 or greater except one (0.47). Risk factors included smoking (350), history of cardiac disease (19), family history of vascular disease (204), and pain in the legs on walking (39). The risk factors could not be correlated with any objective vascular findings (abnormal ABIs). A Doppler ultrasound device, including an inflatable ankle cuff, was used to measure the ABI of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels. Testing was performed on a volunteer basis after the participant completed a check-off sheet of risk factors. In screening for carotid artery disease 1338 women, whose average age was 31 years, had an less than 1% incidence of cardiac disease, and 803 men, whose average age was 40 years, had a 4% incidence. Less than 1% of the group had diabetes mellitus. All patients were asymptomatic referable to the extra-cranial vascular system. Two men of the 2141 persons tested had a lesion meriting further evaluation.

The presence or absence of diabetes mellitus and palpable pulsations at knee level and the angiographic patterns were of no help in the prediction of the results of lumbar sympathectomy. Doppler ankle/arm indices did have predictive value, since in all limbs with Doppler indices lower than 0.30 a major amputation had to be performed. Lumbar sympathectomy still remains a useful procedure in the treatment of selected patients with severe lower limb ischaemia in which reconstructive surgery is not feasible. But it is only advocated in the presence of ankle/arm indices above 0.30 and in the absence of gangrenous lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian secretion of testosterone and androstenedione is increased in postmenopausal women with endometrial cancer, and insulin stimulates ovarian stromal androgen synthesis in vitro. We undertook this study to investigate whether women with endometrial cancer have increased serum immunoreactive insulin levels. Ten postmenopausal women with endometrial carcinoma and 10 postmenopausal women without cancer who matched the cancer patients in age, years since menopause, and percentage of ideal body weight were studied. The women with endometrial cancer had significantly higher fasting serum insulin levels than the normal women [mean, 187 +/- 26 (+/- SE) vs. 55 +/- 11 pmol/L; P less than 0.01]. The cancer patients had significantly higher insulin responses after glucose administration than normal women (sum of 1, 2, and 3 h postglucose values, 5545 +/- 1526 vs. 1444 +/- 156 pmol/L; P less than 0.02), even though their glucose responses were similar. Nests of luteinized cells, which were positive for testosterone by immunoperoxidase staining, were found in the ovarian stroma of 8 of the women with endometrial cancer, but in only 1 of those without cancer (P less than 0.01). Specific high affinity insulin receptors were demonstrable in the stroma of the postmenopausal ovaries. These results suggest that the frequency of stromal luteinization is increased in women with endometrial cancer and that insulin may play a role in the pathogenesis of this luteinization.\r"

  ".W": "We tested plasma from 83 members of a large kindred with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1) for mitogenic activity on cultured bovine parathyroid cells. We evaluated the age dependency of parathyroid mitogenic activity (PMA) in plasma from affected and unaffected members of the kindred, and we analyzed the relation of plasma PMA to indices of activity of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and anterior pituitary tissue. Plasma PMA was higher in members expressing the FMEN1 gene than in their unaffected first, second, third, or fourth degree relatives (P less than 0.05), and 10 of 20 members expressing the FMEN1 gene had plasma PMA above the 95% limit of the control range. Plasma PMA was not dependent on sex or age; the lack of age dependency and the high values in FMEN1 gene carriers suggested that plasma PMA is elevated in some FMEN1 gene carriers very early in life. Plasma PMA in known gene carriers varied significantly with one index of parathyroid function [plasma PMA was 2.5 times higher in the group with than in the group without prior parathyroidectomy (P less than 0.005), an indicator of more severe prior parathyroid disease] and correlated positively, although not significantly so, with indices of pancreatic islet function (serum gastrin by RIA) and anterior pituitary function (serum PRL by RIA). In summary, (1) plasma PMA levels are high in many known carriers of the FMEN1 gene, (2) the high plasma PMA levels in FMEN1 may precede overt endocrine hyperfunction; and (3) high plasma PMA levels vary with one index of parathyroid function, but do not correlate with indices of pancreatic islet or anterior pituitary function in members expressing the FMEN1 gene. The high plasma PMA levels in FMEN1 may be the direct cause of hyperfunction of the parathyroids, but the relation of high plasma PMA to hyperfunction of the pancreatic islets and anterior pituitary is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "The receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are closely related molecules, with an extracellular binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The interaction of insulin and IGF-I with their respective receptors activates the receptor kinase domain, leading to the biological actions of the hormones. Since insulin generally regulates metabolic events and IGF-I generally regulates growth events, it is believed that structural differences in the tyrosine kinase domains of the two respective receptors may elicit different biological responses via different transmembrane signaling mechanisms. We studied the regulation of glycogen metabolism and amino acid uptake in human cultured HEP-G2 hepatoma cells, which have distinct receptors for both insulin and IGF-I. The receptor specificity of these responses was probed with specific monoclonal antibodies to both the insulin and IGF-I receptors. Stimulation of both [3H]glucose incorporation into glycogen and alpha-[3H]aminoisobutyric acid uptake by insulin was half-maximal at concentrations of 1-5 nmol/L. These effects were blocked by the insulin receptor monoclonal antibody MA-10, but not by the IGF-I receptor antibody alpha IR-3. Stimulation of both functions by IGF-I was half-maximal at concentrations of 1-5 nmol/L, and these effects were inhibited by alpha IR-3, but not by MA-10. These studies indicate that in HEP-G2 cells both insulin and IGF-I, via their own receptors, stimulate the same biological responses.\r"

There was a small but significant positive correlation between plasma B-E and cortisol concentrations. When sampled immediately after venipuncture, there were no significant differences in the plasma B-E or cortisol concentrations of children who cried during venipuncture compared with those who did not. These data suggest that morning plasma B-E and cortisol concentrations are constant throughout childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood.\r"

We determined the relative activities of IGF-I, insulin, proinsulin, and the proinsulin conversion intermediates in IGF-I radioreceptor assays using term human placental membranes. Insulin was approximately 0.5% as potent as IGF-I, and proinsulin was only 2% as potent as insulin. The six major proinsulin conversion intermediates were studied; all had activities intermediate between those of insulin and proinsulin. We conclude that the binding of proinsulin and the proinsulin conversion intermediates to IGF-I receptors is not of physiological significance at the concentrations occurring endogenously or after exogenous administration of proinsulin.\r"

At the end of each period each patient was hospitalized for frequent blood sampling from 2000 to 1100 h the following day. A dose-dependent increase in serum GH and serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels occurred. However, the time course of the serum IGF-I concentrations was different on the four occasions; there was a significant fall in the evening when no therapy was given (P less than 0.01), a significant increase after injections of 2 IU R-hGH, and constant levels during treatment with 4 and 6 IU R-hGH. Plasma glucose levels were within the normal range, with a significantly lower fasting level (at 0400 h) when no GH was given. Breakfast induced a plasma glucose rise when GH was administered, but no rise without GH, and a postprandial serum insulin response that was GH dose dependent. GH therapy increased serum FFA (P less than 0.05) and blood 3-hydroxybutyrate levels, but had no effect on blood alanine or lactate or serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. We conclude that the serum IGF-I response to GH is dose dependent, and that a GH replacement dose of 2 IU/day (equalling 1.5 IU/m2.day) is insufficient to maintain normal diurnal serum IGF-I levels. Furthermore, a GH-independent diurnal variation in serum IGF-I in these patients is suggested. This GH preparation also has diabetogenic and lipolytic actions.\r"

We initially compared immunocytochemical staining of progesterone and estradiol receptors on endometrial fragments obtained by either aspiration or endometrial biopsy and found that immunocytochemistry could be performed easily on tissue obtained in either way. The immunocytochemical studies showed that the concentration and distribution of receptors changed markedly during the normal menstrual cycle. These changes were distributed in three characteristic phases. During phase I, corresponding to the midfollicular period (days 7-8), a small proportion (25%) of stromal and glandular cells stained positively for the progesterone receptor, whereas estrogen receptor staining was more intense and more frequent (50% of cells). Phase II, which included both the late follicular and early luteal periods (days 9-19), was characterized by a marked staining of progesterone receptors in the majority of glandular cells (75%) and somewhat less abundant and less frequent staining in stromal cells (50%). Estrogen receptor staining was present in about half of the glandular and stromal cells. Phase III, the mid- and late luteal period (days 21-27), was characterized by the disappearance of estrogen and progesterone receptor staining in glandular cells, although faint staining for both receptors was found in stromal cells. These variations in progesterone receptor staining are potentially useful for determining the effect of progesterone on endometrial maturation.\r"

Ultrafast computed tomography, by virtue of its rapid data acquisition time and reasonable spatial resolution, may be useful in this regard. To determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of this imaging modality as compared with cardiac catheterization, a multicenter study was undertaken. There were two parts to the study. Part I involved the evaluation of 179 grafts in 74 patients studied in the five participating centers between March 1985 and August 1986. Twenty-nine percent of these graft studies were found to be technically inadequate and were excluded before patency determinations began. The remaining group of 127 bypass grafts in 62 patients had studies adequate for interpretation. Fifty-one grafts were to the left anterior descending coronary artery or a diagonal branch, 37 to branches of the left circumflex artery and 28 to the right coronary artery or a posterior descending vessel; in addition, there were 11 internal mammary artery bypass grafts primarily into the left anterior descending or diagonal artery distribution. The sensitivity of detecting angiographically open grafts was 93.4%, the specificity of detecting angiographically closed grafts 88.9% and the predictive accuracy was 92.1%. A subsequent study (Part 2) was performed 9 months later to assess the ability to carry out technically adequate examinations. Of the 138 consecutive graft examinations (50 patients) included in this part of the study, 94.2% of the examinations were found to be technically adequate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that myocardium reperfused after reversible ischemia exhibits prolonged depression of contractile function (\"stunning\"), which is associated with various ultrastructural, biochemical, vascular and other functional abnormalities. Clinical observations suggest that stunning occurs in many situations (for example, rest and exercise-induced angina, myocardial infarction with early reperfusion, open heart surgery, transplantation) and thus may contribute significantly to morbidity among patients with coronary artery disease. In recent years an increasing number of studies have provided indirect evidence that postischemic myocardial dysfunction may be mediated in part by the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radical (.O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (.OH). Thus, it has been shown that the recovery of the stunned myocardium is enhanced by agents that either scavenge oxygen metabolites, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine and dimethylthiourea, or prevent their generation, such as allopurinol, oxypurinol and desferrioxamine. More recent experiments utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy have directly demonstrated that reperfusion after a reversible ischemic episode is associated with a burst of free radical production. At present, the evidence supporting the free radical hypothesis is suggestive but not conclusive. Definitive demonstration of the role of oxy-radicals will require careful studies measuring the production of these species in conscious animal models of postischemic dysfunction. If confirmed, the free radical hypothesis will provide not only new important insights into the pathophysiology of ischemic injury, but also a rationale for developing clinically applicable interventions.\r"

  ".U": "88244211\r", 
  ".W": "The past 15 years have been witness to a remarkable growth in knowledge regarding the modulation of \"sympathetic traffic\" to neuroeffector organs, including vascular tissue. The release of norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons is now known to be under both negative and positive feedback control. Norepinephrine, when released from peripheral neurons, acts on presynaptic alpha 2-receptors to inhibit further neurotransmission. Vascular postsynaptic alpha 2-receptors, sensitive to circulating catecholamines, subserve vasoconstriction. The antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanabenz and guanfacin likely reduce blood pressure by acting centrally on alpha 2 postsynaptic neurons to limit sympathetic transmission to blood vessels. Clonidine can produce venoconstriction and thereby improve orthostatic hypotension by activating venous alpha 2-receptors. Additional presynaptic dopaminergic receptors (DA2), muscarinic receptors (acetylcholine), opioid receptors, prostaglandin receptors, adenosine receptors (A1) and histamine (H2) receptors are present on sympathetic nerve membranes and, when engaged with the appropriate ligand, can limit the exocytotic process. Gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin demonstrate similar roles in reducing sympathetic nerve activity. In contrast to these inhibitory presynaptic mechanisms, facilitation of norepinephrine release appears to occur by way of neuronal angiotensin II receptor activation and perhaps through stimulation of sympathetic nerve membrane beta 2-receptors. An appreciation of these inhibitory and facilitator mechanisms is useful in the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, septic shock and a number of common withdrawal syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the changes in left ventricular filling associated with acute cardiac rejection, serial Doppler echocardiographic examinations were prospectively performed on the same day as endomyocardial biopsy in 55 consecutive patients who successfully underwent orthotopic transplantation and were free of a previous episode of rejection. On average, 8.6 Doppler studies per patient were performed within a 6 month period after transplantation. Recordings of mitral flow were made with pulsed Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography from an apical four chamber view; isovolumic relaxation time, peak early mitral flow velocity and pressure half-time were measured. The patients were classified into two groups on the basis of the histopathologic findings: group I (25 patients with at least one episode of mild or moderate rejection) and group II (30 patients without rejection). In group I, rejection was associated with a significant decrease of isovolumic relaxation time (p less than 0.005) and especially pressure half-time (p less than 0.0005) with no change in heart rate and peak early mitral flow velocity. In group II, Doppler indexes remained unchanged. These changes were not associated with alterations in left ventricular systolic function assessed by echocardiography. Isovolumic relaxation time and pressure half-time both returned to values similar to baseline values after immunosuppressive therapy (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). With 20% decrease in pressure half-time as a criterion for acute rejection, sensitivity was 88%, specificity 87% and positive predictive value 85%. Thus, Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function provides an excellent tool for early detection of acute rejection and noninvasive monitoring of the cardiac transplant recipient.\r"

  ".U": "88244228\r", 
  ".W": "In a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study involving 13 medical centers, 575 patients undergoing single valve replacement were prospectively randomized to receive either the standard Bjork-Shiley prosthesis or the Hancock porcine heterograft (with a modified orifice for sizes 23 and smaller). The hemodynamic data in the 268 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization an average of 6 months (range 3 to 12) postoperatively are reported. Statistical analyses were performed on valve sizes 23, 25 and 27 in the aortic position, and 29, 31 and 33 in the mitral position. A wide variation was observed in mean pressure gradient and calculated orifice area in both valve types within all sizes in both the aortic and the mitral positions. In the aortic position, the Bjork-Shiley prosthesis tended to have a lower pressure gradient and larger calculated orifice area than the Hancock heterograft, but the differences in gradient between the two valve types were significant only in the larger-sized valves. The difference in calculated area between the two valve types was not significant within each valve size. In the mitral position, there were no differences in gradient and calculated orifice area between the two types of prostheses. The postoperative cardiac index, regurgitant volume, pulmonary artery systolic and mean pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index did not differ in patients receiving the Bjork-Shiley prosthesis from values in patients receiving the Hancock heterograft. Hence, the overall hemodynamic performance of both types of valves is remarkably similar. The choice between these two prostheses should, therefore, be governed not by the hemodynamic performance, but by other factors such as valve durability, risk of anticoagulation and incidence of valve-related complications.\r"

The trial was designed as a prospective double-blind parallel study of the effect of stepwise increase of either beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide from 200 micrograms through 400 micrograms, to 800 micrograms daily in three consecutive periods of 4 weeks. At the end of each period, the adrenal stress response was evaluated by measurements of serum cortisol and androstenedione during a short adrenocorticotropic hormone test. The unstimulated diurnal production of glucocorticosteroids was assessed by measurements of free cortisol in 24-hour urine samples. Free cortisol in urine was found a valid measure of the total diurnal excretion of cortisol metabolites, since it exhibited a good correlation to the fractional cortisol metabolites measured by gas chromatography. The adrenal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation was unaffected by treatment or dose. The unstimulated diurnal production of glucocorticosteroids demonstrated a highly significant dose-related suppression in response to the inhaled steroids. No significant difference was found between the two topical steroids (probability value 5.3%), and yet the suppression was apparent in the group of children treated with beclomethasone dipropionate but not in the group of children treated with budesonide. Further studies are desirable in order to ascertain whether budesonide offers an improved ratio between beneficial anti-inflammatory effect and unwanted systemic activity.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of ketotifen, an oral antiallergic and antihistaminic drug, on the airway and cutaneous responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a double-blind, randomized, and crossover study in six normal subjects. Ketotifen (three doses of 2 mg taken during a 14-hour period before PAF) did not alter PAF-induced bronchoconstriction and did not prevent the accompanying flushing and coughing. The transient neutropenia (74.5 +/- 4.8% fall; p less than 0.001) and rebound neutrophilia (104 +/- 55% rise) induced by PAF were not affected by ketotifen. On the day placebo was received, airway responsiveness to methacholine increased after PAF exposure with the concentration needed to cause a 40% fall in baseline partial expiratory flow rate (PC40), decreasing from 69.2 mg/ml (geometric standard error of the mean, 2.69) to 23.3 mg/ml (2.34) on day 3 (p less than 0.001). Ketotifen had no effect, because on the day ketotifen was administered, mean PC40 also decreased from 52.7 mg/ml (2.5) to 21.5 mg/ml (2.14) (p less than 0.01). In the skin, ketotifen reduced the flare area (from 8.05 +/- 3.60 to 1.14 +/- 0.29 cm2; p less than 0.05) and the wheal volume (from 0.068 +/- 0.010 to 0.045 +/- 0.008 cc; p = 0.02) induced by intradermal PAF (200 ng). Cutaneous responses to histamine (1 microgram) were significantly inhibited. Thus, the bronchoconstriction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by PAF are not inhibited by ketotifen. Ketotifen inhibits PAF-induced wheal and flare in the skin, which is probably histamine dependent. The airway effects of PAF are unlikely to be mediated by histamine release.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-CSF is one of the hemopoietic growth factors that stimulates neutrophilic granulocyte and macrophage production by bone marrow progenitor cells. In this study, the effect of GM-CSF on the growth and differentiation of murine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) was investigated. In the presence of GM-CSF, normal murine PAM were induced to proliferate and develop into macrophage colonies with a dose-response curve similar to that of bone marrow GM colony-forming cells. PAM also responded to CSF-1, a lineage-restricted growth factor, but required much higher doses of CSF-1 and a longer incubation time for optimal colony formation. The proliferative response of PAM to CSF-1, however, was greatly enhanced by the concurrent addition of low doses of GM-CSF. In contrast, low doses of CSF-1 failed to potentiate the proliferative response of PAM to GM-CSF. Macrophages derived from GM-CSF cultures were rounder and less stretched and possessed less FcR-mediated phagocytic activity than cells produced in CSF-1 cultures. A study with hydrocortisone-induced monocytopenia showed that nearly one half of lung macrophages may be sustained by local proliferation of PAM without the continuous migration of blood monocytes. This study suggests that GM-CSF may play a major role in the production of PAM by two modes of action, 1) direct stimulation of cell proliferation and 2) enhancement of their responsiveness to CSF-1, thereby producing more mature and functionally competent macrophages.\r"

These supernatants did not contain IL-2 or IFN-gamma, and the enhancing activity could be chromatographically separated from IL-3, -4, -5, and granulocyte/macrophage CSF. The possibility that the thymocyte enhancement factor contained in these supernatants was IL-6 was suggested when murine rIL-6 was found to have similar activity. Further evidence for the identity of these two factors was obtained when an IL-6 assay, based on plasmacytoma growth, was used to test column fractions showing thymocyte enhancement. All fractions active in the thymocyte enhancement assay also had activity in the plasmacytoma growth assay. These observations suggest that the thymocyte-stimulating activity present in the T cell supernatants was due to IL-6.\r"

Geneticin selection in culture followed by FACS sorting on the basis of strong positivity with the mAb W6/32 (which is specific for the HLA class I H chain associated to beta 2-microglobulin) have led to the establishment of a HLA+ Daudi cell line permanently expressing HLA A10, A11, and B17 molecules.

Mouse mIgA myeloma proteins were labeled either by direct iodination or by coupling the residualizing label, dilactitol-125I-tyramine (125I-DLT) to the proteins; catabolites from protein labeled with 125I-DLT accumulate at the site of protein degradation, allowing identification of the tissue and cellular sites involved in catabolism of the protein. The circulating half-lives of 125I- and 125I-DLT-mIgA were the same. The distribution of radioactivity in tissues was measured at 1, 3, 24, and 96 h after iv. injection of 125I-DLT-labeled mIgA, dimeric IgA (dIgA), IgG, or mouse serum albumin. The greatest uptake of 125I-DLT-mIgA was attributable to the liver. This organ accounted for more internal catabolism of mIgA than all other tissues combined. In contrast, 125I-DLT-IgG was catabolized equally in skin, muscle, and liver. These data indicate that, in mice, the liver is the major site of mIgA catabolism. To determine the cell types involved, collagenase digestion was used to isolate parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells from perfused liver of animals injected with 125-DLT-mIgA. Most of the radioactivity was associated with the hepatocyte fraction, even though both cell types showed uptake of 125I-DLT-mIgA. Inhibition studies, with asialofetuin and mouse IgA demonstrated that the uptake of mIgA by liver cells was mediated primarily by the asialoglycoprotein receptor.\r"

Several residues of the toxin clustered in the C-terminal region were shown likely to be part of the discontinuous epitope recognized by the antibody. The positive charge of the N epsilon-Lys-58 seems to play a pivotal role in the binding of the toxin to both the mAb and the sodium channel receptor.\r"
