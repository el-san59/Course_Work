  ".W": "We used the in vivo intestinal loop approach, with short (10-min) and long (3-h) incubations, to examine biotin absorption in proximal jejunum, distal ileum, cecum and proximal colon. In short-term studies, luminal biotin disappearance from rat ileum was about half that observed in the jejunum, whereas absorption by proximal colon was about 12% of that in the jejunum. In 3-h closed-loop studies, the absorption of 1.0 microM biotin varied regionally. Biotin absorption was nearly complete in the small intestine after 3 h; however, only about 15% of the dose had been absorbed in the cecum and 27% in the proximal colon after 3 h. Independent of site of administration, the major fraction of absorbed biotin was recovered in the liver; measurable amounts of radioactive biotin were also present in kidney and plasma. The results support the potential nutritional significance for the rat of biotin synthesized by bacteria in the distal intestine, by demonstrating directly an absorptive capability of mammalian large bowel for this vitamin.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to analyze the role of moisture content of foods in producing dietary obesity. Female CD rats consumed more energy when offered a sucrose solution and plain water to drink than when they were only given plain water, regardless of the sugar content of their diet (0-65%). This suggested that the overeating that commonly occurs when sucrose solutions are offered may not be due to sucrose per se. In subsequent experiments, rats were fed modified AIN-76 diets high in sucrose, starch or fat for 28-42 d. For some rats, the diet was liquefied by adding water to make a 32% suspension. Plain drinking water was always available. Rats fed high carbohydrate liquid diets, with or without solid diet, consumed 8-15% more energy than rats fed solid diet only. Rats fed liquid diets also gained 43-206% more weight than did rats fed solid diets. Analysis of carcass composition revealed that the liquid diets increased body fat. For high fat diets, the results were more complicated. Addition of water to a low cellulose, high fat diet did not increase adiposity, whereas addition of water to a high cellulose, high fat diet did increase adiposity. These results suggest that the obesity-inducing effects of feeding sugar solutions or cafeteria diets may be due, in part, to the high water content of these foods.\r"

Rats were weighed three times weekly and their intakes adjusted so that five or six rats within each diet gained maximally or at 2, 3, 4 or 5 g/d. Live weight for each rat was 80 g at the start and 205 g when the experiment ended. Ten additional rats were killed at about 80 g to estimate initial composition. The gain contained less (P less than 0.005) water and protein and more (P less than 0.005) lipid as rate of gain increased. Gain of gastrointestinal tract was increased (P less than 0.005) with increasing rate of gain. Rats that gained faster had shorter (P less than 0.05) tibias. More (P less than 0.005) water and protein and less (P less than 0.005) lipid were in the gain of rats fed the 20% casein diet than of those fed the 10% casein diet. Rats fed the 10% casein diet had longer bodies, and those fed the 20% casein diet had longer tibias. Water and protein gain declined and tibia length was less while liver gain increased with increasing rate of gain, but all rates of change for these measurements were higher for rats fed the 10% casein diet. Dissected epididymal fat pad gain was unaffected by casein level or rate of gain. These results demonstrate that chemical composition of the total gain can be altered when rate of growth is controlled and that the epididymal fat pad is not representative of chemical composition.\r"

  ".W": "Young rats fed a protein-deficient diet have elevated total triiodothyronine (T3) levels in spite of decreased skeletal muscle protein turnover. Interpretation of the thyroid status of these animals is complicated by increased T3 binding by serum proteins. Free T3 levels ranging from normal to low and decreased resting oxygen consumption have been reported. To investigate the thyroid status of animals fed a protein-free diet, ventricular myosin ATPase activity and isomyosin profile have been used as an index of thyroid hormone activity. The effect of the protein-free diet has been compared to a restricted high protein-low carbohydrate diet, which causes clear evidence of decreased thyroid hormone effect. After 28 d, calcium-activated myosin ATPase activity was 1.50 +/- 0.05 mumol Pi/(mg protein.min) in animals fed the basal diet, 1.16 +/- 0.03 mumol Pi/(mg protein.min) in animals fed the restricted high protein-low carbohydrate diet and 1.48 +/- 0.04 mumol Pi/(mg protein.min) in animals fed the protein-free diet. In addition, a shift in isomyosin content with the appearance of V2 and V3 isomyosins occurred with the restricted high protein-low carbohydrate diet but not the protein-free diet. The failure of the protein-depleted rats to decrease myosin ATPase activity and alter isomyosin content suggests that they are euthyroid.\r"

A Scatchard plot, based on the binding of 125I-labeled lectin to isolated intestinal epithelial cells, was used to calculate an association constant (Ka) of 15 x 10(6)M-1 and the number of binding sites per cell, 12 x 10(6). Metabolic studies were conducted over a period of 5 d on groups of rats fed raw or autoclaved navy bean flour and casein with or without the purified lectin. Growth, protein digestibility, biological value and net protein utilization were significantly lower in animals that had been fed raw navy bean flour or casein plus lectin than in control groups fed diets containing autoclaved navy bean flour or casein alone. Vascular perfusion was used to measure the rate of uptake of glucose by the intestines of rats that had received the various dietary treatments. The rate of absorption of [14C]glucose by intestines from rats fed raw navy bean flour or casein plus lectin was approximately one-half that of their counterparts fed the autoclaved flour or casein alone. These results provide evidence that the lectin, by virtue of its interference with intestinal absorption, is responsible, at least in part, for the nutritional inferiority of raw navy beans.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of three components of the routine admission complete blood cell count (leukocyte count, hematocrit, and platelet count) was evaluated in 301 patients consecutively admitted to the internal medicine wards of a university teaching hospital. Using a consensus analysis approach, three faculty members reviewed the patients' charts to determine which tests were performed routinely, which tests were abnormal, and which routine tests led to diagnostic or therapeutic changes. Overall, 55.3% of the tests were considered routine admission tests. Abnormalities were detected in 13.6% of the routine leukocyte counts, in 8.2% of the routine hematocrit levels, and in 12.4% of the routine platelet counts. However, treatment was changed for only three patients, all of whom had low hematocrits; this amounted to 0.6% of all tests. Furthermore, only one of the three patients received appropriate treatment that might have been withheld if a routine hematocrit determination had not been ordered. The authors conclude that the impact of routine admission complete blood cell counts on patient management is small and that the practice of ordering this test for all hospitalized patients could be eliminated with little adverse effect on patient care.\r"

Little is known about their curricula because there is no separate residency review committee to critique the current programs. The directors of the 65 current programs were surveyed by mail. Fifty-seven (88%) responded to questions about: lengths of time programs had been in operation, attitudes toward quality of residents, program structures and curricula, and performances of graduates taking the Boards. More than half of the programs were established after 1980. Forty of the programs' graduates have passed the Medicine Boards, and 48 have passed the Pediatrics written Boards. Most programs were structured to have residents switch specialties every six months. Program Directors, both in Medicine and in Pediatrics, rated the quality of combined program residents the same as or slightly better than that of residents in non-combined programs. Medicine/pediatrics residencies have become a successful and important source of training for generalists' careers in and outside of academe, and in both primary and specialty care.\r"

Controls, a random sample of patients who had hypertension, were frequency-matched to cases by age and gender. Blind to case--control status, the authors reviewed the medical records of the 32 cases and 64 controls for reports of angina-like symptoms. While controls reported such symptoms at a constant rate, the events for the cases clustered near their infarctions. When a patient with hypertension sought medical advice for angina-like symptoms, the risk of infarction within 30 days was 14.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 71), and after 30 days it fell to 1.03. Among patients who have high blood pressure but no history of angina, presentations with prodromal symptoms in the primary care setting are so common that only about one in 100 such visits actually heralds myocardial infarction.\r"

Overall, 66% of visits were by poor, underinsured, and uninsured patients. The majority of directors (75%) considered care of the poor a goal of their divisions. The most commonly reported response to the cost containment environment was implementation of revenue-generating measures (66%); 19% reported reductions in care to the poor; and 20% reported increased service to this group. It is concluded that DGMs care for large numbers of poor and uninsured patients and therefore must carefully evaluate the impacts of current policy proposals on their future ambulatory care activities.\r"

All patient admissions during one year, excluding routine obstetrical cases, were surveyed. Physicians and nurses used a simple continuous scale to indicate care level (1 = comfort care to 5 = full care). Nurses were more willing than physicians to limit care efforts for patients (mean scores of 4.35 vs 4.79, respectively). Both physicians and nurses indicated nearly identical factors important in making decisions to limit full resuscitative efforts: quality of life, nature of underlying illness, and age. A significant communication gap existed between nurses and physicians regarding aggressiveness of care: physicians indicated communication with nursing staff in 564 cases; nurses acknowledged this in only 56 of these same cases. These data suggest that current policies regarding do not resuscitate (DNR) orders should be broadened to include guidelines for less than full aggressive patient care. These policies should ensure adequate, documented communication between professional staff, patients, and others significantly involved with patient care decisions.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency readmissions among patients discharged from the medical service of an acute-care teaching hospital were analyzed. Using the multivariate technique of recursive partitioning, the authors developed and validated a model to predict readmission based on diagnoses and other clinical factors. Of the 4,769 patients in the validation series, 19% were readmitted within 90 days. Twenty-six per cent of the readmissions occurred within ten days of discharge, and 57% within 30 days. Readmitted patients were older, had longer hospitalizations, and had greater hospital charges (p less than 0.01). The discharge diagnoses of AIDS, renal disease, and cancer were associated with increased risks of readmission regardless of patients' demographics or test results. The relative risks (95% confidence interval) associated with these diagnoses were: AIDS, 3.3 (1.4-7.8); renal disease, 2.3 (1.7-3.0); cancer, 2.8 (2.4-3.4). Other patients at increased risk were those with diabetes, anemia, and elevated creatinine (2.1; 1.6-2.8) and those with heart failure and elevated anion gaps (2.2; 1.7-2.8). For patients without one of these diagnoses, a normal albumin and no prior admission within 60 days identified patients at reduced risk for readmission (0.4; 0.3-0.4). Thus, commonly available clinical data identify patients at increased risk for emergency readmission. Risk factor profiles should alert physicians to these patients, as intensive intervention may be appropriate. Future studies should test the impacts of clinical interventions designed to reduce emergency readmissions.\r"

Antihypertensive drug therapy and blood pressure control were determined from a medical record review. Functional status (health perceptions, mental health, role, and physical functioning) was assessed with a questionnaire. After adjustment for potential confounders, hypertensive patients without drug therapy were less likely to have impairment in mental health functioning, compared with patients receiving one or more than one antihypertensive medication (9% versus 25% and 20% respectively, p less than 0.05). However, uncontrolled hypertensive patients were more likely to have role limitations than patients controlled only at the end or throughout the record review period (51% versus 39% and 36%, respectively, p less than 0.05). Patients controlled throughout the review period had the least impairment for each measure of functional status. These preliminary findings suggest that pharmacologic therapy may have a negative influence on the mental health of \"uncomplicated\" hypertensive patients, but that the dual goals of blood pressure control and positive functional status are not incompatible.\r"

Subjects earned monetary reinforcement by correctly identifying the training drugs by letter code. Subjects received a single drug administration in each daily experimental session. During each session, subjective and physiological effects and three behavioral measures of discrimination (including an operant response, a qualitative response and a quantitative response) were collected. The study was done in three phases: a training phase in which training drugs were identified to subjects by letter code before the session, a test of acquisition phase in which the subject's ability to identify the training drug by letter code was tested and a generalization phase in which dose-response curves for the two active training drugs were tested. Results of acquisition testing of the training drug doses were similar in all three discrimination measures. The two active drugs produced contrasting effects on the various subjective report measures (opioid agonist-like effects vs. opioid withdrawal-like effects). In generalization testing, hydromorphone produced dose-related hydromorphone-appropriate responding, and naloxone produced dose-related naloxone-appropriate responding. Lowest doses of each drug produced saline-appropriate responding; there was no cross-generalization between either active drug. Similarly, hydromorphone and naloxone produced orderly dose-dependent effects on subjective effect scales similar to those produced by the training doses.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of guinea pig tracheal muscle tone by cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent relaxant mechanisms was investigated by studying the tracheal relaxant activities of forskolin, nitroprusside, N6-2'-O-dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and 8-bromoguanosine-cyclic GMP. In carbachol (3 X 10(-6) M)-contracted isolated tracheal rings, N6-2'-O-dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and 8-bromoguanosine-cyclic GMP each caused biphasic relaxation responses, which consisted of an acute relaxation followed by a sustained but lesser degree of relaxation. The biphasic nature of this response is suggested to result from a functional counter-balancing of cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxant mechanisms and the contractile mechanisms stimulated by carbachol. The sensitivity of carbachol-contracted tracheal rings to forskolin and nitroprusside (activators of adenylate and guanylate cyclase, respectively) was generally not influenced by N6-2'-O-dibutyryl-cyclic AMP or 8-bromoguanosine-cyclic GMP in concentrations that induced up to 50% relaxation of the trachea. Furthermore, the partial relaxation of tracheal tension with one cyclic nucleotide analog did not alter the sensitivity of the tracheal rings to the other. These results demonstrate that cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent mechanisms induce relaxations of the trachea that are functionally additive, each neither potentiating nor depressing the effects of the other. In the presence of 3 X 10(-6) M carbachol, the effectiveness of cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent relaxant mechanisms appears to be fixed, and independent of the amount of active tension being maintained by the tracheal muscle itself.\r"

However, no satisfactory explanation has been given for this phenomenon. In this paper, a theoretical model for a two-receptor-one-transducer system is developed that can be used to establish conditions under which agonist-agonist interactions may exhibit amplification. It is predicted that threshold amplification results when the common transducer relation subserving each receptor is positively cooperative. When this relation is rectangular hyperbolic or negatively cooperative, less than additive affects are predicted in general. This model also predicts mutual potentiation between agonists in the positively cooperative case. In practice, amplification and potentiation between agonists may be related to and predicted from the shapes of concentration-effect curves for the individual agonists. The predictions of the model are tested experimentally by analyzing the interactions between histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in rabbit isolated aorta and between norepinephrine and histamine in guinea pig isolated right atria.\r"

It demonstrates apparently simple competitive antagonism in isolated tissue assays and in brain adenylate cyclase assays. In this study its action in a cardiac adenylate cyclase assay was compared with its effects in the isolated guinea pig right atrial preparation. Using either histamine or impromidine, cimetidine expressed similar affinity (pKB = 6.1) in the intact tissue assay. In washed homogenates of guinea pig ventricle cimetidine appeared to antagonize competitively the stimulation by histamine of adenylate cyclase but the estimated pKB was 6.7. In contrast, the pKB for tiotidine was similar in both assays (7.7). Application of a recently developed concentration-ratios method indicated that cimetidine expressed a resultant action in the cyclase assay consisting of competitive H2-receptor antagonism and an additional inhibitory property involving a postreceptor action. The concentration-ratios analysis allowed the purely competitive component of cimetidine action to be quantified in the cyclase assay giving a pKB of 6.0.\r"

When administered in microdoses (9 micrograms i.v.) to rats (male Wistars, 270-300 g), a steep distribution phase (T1/2 = 0.25 hr) was followed by a relatively slow beta-phase (T1/2 = 40 hr). The observed volume of distribution was 390 ml. This pharmacokinetic behavior contrasted highly with the one seen for higher (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) doses (unlabeled) warfarin; volume of distribution = 45 ml, T1/2 = 12.5 hr. If a \"macrodose\" (0.2 mg/kg) preceded (16 hr) the \"microdose,\" \"normal\" pharmacokinetics were observed for the latter, suggesting a saturable \"deep compartment.\" The administration of 4-hydroxycoumarins (i.e., acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon and warfarin) after the microdose of [14C]warfarin was in its beta-phase caused a rapid rise of plasma [14C]warfarin indicating [14C]warfarin to be displaced from the \"deep compartment.\" The rate of appearance of [14C]warfarin was 0.3 hr-1 irrespective the 4-hydroxycoumarin used. The hepatic distribution of [14C]warfarin was investigated and the effect of a displacer thereupon. Fifty-three hours after the [14C]warfarin administration, the liver contained about 40% of the dose; 45% of it was bound to microsomes. The administration of acenocoumarol (0.2 mg/kg) at 48 hr, halved the liver content. [14C]warfarin was redistributed from microsomes (-65%) and from the 10,000 X g pellet (-65%) into the cytosol (+260%) and the plasma (+320%). Microsomal bound [14C]warfarin in vitro could not be washed out or be displaced unless dithiothreitol (50 mM) was included in the washing buffers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximum depression of mixed function oxidase occurred on the 2nd day of infection. This loss in drug biotransformation capacity in the liver was correlated directly with the number of organisms found in that organ. The ability of mice to metabolize drugs in vivo also was impaired during Listeria monocytogenes infection. During the infective period the half-life of theophylline was significantly prolonged and the N-demethylation of aminopyrine as measured by the expiration of 14CO2 from radiolabeled aminopyrine was diminished. The loss of drug metabolism was not due to interferon production, fever or morphological damage to the liver. These results indicate that certain bacterial infections can depress drug biotransformation and elimination in a similar manner to that already reported in viral and parasitic infections. This finding may be of significance to patients receiving drugs which are metabolized by the mixed function oxidase system during episodes of infection with some bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of yohimbine on nicotine- and dimethylphenylpiperadinium (DMPP)-induced release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic cardiac nerves of the dog was examined in order to elucidate the interaction of presynaptic alpha and nicotinic receptors. Intracoronary infusion of nicotine (300 or 500 micrograms/min) or DMPP (100 or 300 micrograms/min) into the left circumflex artery increased coronary sinus output of NE (NE output), left ventricular dp/dt maximum (LV dp/dt max) and coronary sinus blood flow. The nicotine-induced increases in NE output, LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow were enhanced by simultaneous yohimbine infusion in doses of 10 and 30 micrograms/min into the same artery, and were attenuated by the drug in a dose of 100 micrograms/min. The DMPP-induced increases were enhanced by 10 micrograms/min of yohimbine infusion, but the enhancement was decreased by 30 and 100 micrograms/min. Yohimbine did not modify increases in NE output, LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow induced by intracoronary infusion of tyramine (100 micrograms/min). We have reported previously that yohimbine in the dose range used enhanced cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation-induced increases in these parameters in a dose-dependent manner in the same preparation. The enhancement by yohimbine of nicotinic receptor-mediated NE release would be due to the blockade of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Therefore, it is suggested that presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated feedback control operates on the process of NE release induced by nicotinic receptor activation as well as nerve stimulation. Although the mechanism of loss of the enhancement of the nicotinic effect by the large dose of yohimbine is not known, the possible mechanisms are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alinidine on negative chrono- and inotropic responses to cholinergic interventions, i.e., intramural vagal nerve stimulation and an injection of acetylcholine (ACh) or carbachol, were investigated in isolated, blood-perfused canine atrial preparations perfused by arterial blood from donor dogs. Vagal nerve stimulation (5, 10 or 30 Hz) and an injection of ACh (0.17-1.65 nmol) or carbachol (0.05-0.55 nmol) induced frequency-dependent and dose-dependent negative chrono- and inotropic responses, respectively. These responses were reproducible in the same preparation. During the negative chrono- and inotropic responses to alinidine (85-854 nmol), cardiac responses to cholinergic interventions were depressed dose-dependently. The depressive effects of alinidine on the negative chronotropic responses were significantly (P less than .05) greater than those on the negative inotropic ones. However, alinidine did not affect adenosine-induced negative cardiac responses. Atropine (0.43-4.32 nmol) uniformly blocked responses to cholinergic intervention dose-dependently. The potency of the antimuscarinic effect of alinidine was approximately 1/200 to 1/500 of the potency of atropine at the 50% inhibition dose for responses to vagal stimulation, carbachol and ACh. Intravenous administration of alinidine (1 mg/kg) to the donor dog also suppressed cardiac responses to choline esters and vagal stimulation in the isolated atrium perfused by the donor's blood. These results suggest that alinidine has suppressive effects on the negative chrono- and inotropic responses to exogenous choline esters and endogenous ACh from parasympathetic nerve terminals at the post-junctional cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the dog heart.\r"

  ".U": "88090523\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies which demonstrated an intestinal secretion of quaternary ammonium compounds in the jejunum were extended to nonquaternary amines. Telenzepine and pirenzepine, two structurally similar compounds differing in lipid solubility, were administered either to the lumen or blood side of isolated mucosae of guinea pig jejunum and colon mounted in a flux chamber. Transepithelial permeation of both drugs from blood to lumen side was 3.2 to 18 times higher than in the reverse, absorptive direction. The indicated net secretion was highest with telenzepine in the colon. At 7 degrees C transepithelial permeation was restricted to paracellular shunt fluxes. In the colon, the highest cellular concentrations were observed after blood side administration of telenzepine and pirenzepine (500 and 150% of that of the incubation solution). At 7 degrees C these values were reduced to 1 of 5 and 1 of 8 of the values at 37 degrees C. At pH 6.6, 7.4 or 8.2, no differences in the colonic secretion of telenzepine were seen; cellular concentration increased with increasing pH only after luminal administration. Under all conditions, the colon acidified the luminal solution by roughly 0.4 pH units. Phenoxybenzamine, shown previously to inhibit the jejunal secretion of quaternary ammonium compounds, inhibited the secretion of pirenzepine and telenzepine in both gut segments, but did not affect blood-to-lumen permeation of N-methylscopolamine in the colon. In addition, phenoxybenzamine reduced the cellular content in the colon but had little or no effect on pirenzepine or telenzepine content in the jejunum. The results are consistent with a model in which the nonquaternary amines are secreted in the jejunum by two serial transport steps specific for the base cations; an additional diffusion of the free bases is of importance in the basolateral membrane. In the colon, carrier-mediated influx increases with lipophilicity of the base cations, whereas efflux across the brush border is limited to diffusion of the free bases; concomitant luminal acidification and formation of base cations maintains the diffusion gradient.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate possible mechanisms by which coenzyme Q10 enhances reoxygenation-induced recovery of cardiac contractile force after hypoxia, rabbit hearts were subjected to hypoxic perfusion for 20 min, followed by 45 min-reoxygenation with or without pretreatment with coenzyme Q10. Hypoxia induced a decline in cardiac contractile force, a decrease in myocardial high-energy phosphates and a release of ATP metabolites and creatine phosphokinase from the perfused heart. Upon reoxygenation the rate of release of ATP metabolites subsided, but no appreciable recovery of the loss of contractile force and the reduction of myocardial ATP content was seen, and the release of creatine phosphokinase was increased further. Pretreatment of rabbits with coenzyme Q10 resulted in an appreciable recovery of cardiac contractile force and of myocardial ATP content upon reoxygenation. The release of creatine phosphokinase from hearts during hypoxia and reoxygenation was inhibited completely by the pretreatment. Changes in the UV absorbance of the perfusate suggested that coenzyme Q10 reduced the loss of ATP metabolites from hypoxic hearts. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis indicated that coenzyme Q10 attenuated the release of inosine and hypoxanthine from the hearts and decreased myocardial inosine and adenosine content of the hypoxic heart, suggesting that coenzyme Q10 retards the breakdown of ATP metabolites which are possible substrates for a salvage synthesis of ATP, when oxygen is replenished. This could account for an appreciable restoration of ATP, and eventually provide a significant recovery of cardiac contractile force upon reoxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Transport characteristics of benzylpenicillin in the central nervous system was examined using ATP-depleted rat choroid plexus. In the presence of an outwardly directed Cl- gradient, accumulation of benzylpenicillin was stimulated markedly compared with the accumulation in the absence of Cl- gradient. Under Cl- gradient conditions, benzylpenicillin was accumulated transiently at a concentration approximately 1.7-fold higher than at equilibrium (\"overshoot\") implying the uphill transport. The Cl- gradient-stimulated accumulation of benzylpenicillin was not solely due to the changes in the membrane potential or in the intracellular pH. Accumulation of benzylpenicillin in choroid plexuses preloaded with HCO3-, SCN- or benzylpenicillin also was stimulated compared with the accumulation in unpreloaded choroid plexuses. The Cl- gradient-stimulated benzylpenicillin accumulation was saturable (Km = 13.6 microM and Vmax = 3.76 nmol/ml of tissue per min), and was reduced by sulfhydryl reagents (p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid and N-ethylmaleimide). Probenecid and anionic exchange inhibitors (furosemide, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) inhibited the Cl- gradient-stimulated benzylpenicillin accumulation in a dose-dependent fashion. An inwardly directed Na+ gradient did not stimulate the accumulation of benzylpenicillin. These findings suggest that the principal mechanism for the uphill transport of benzylpenicillin in the rat choroid plexus is via an anionic exchanger.\r"

To study the role of sugar moiety and bromine in the antinicotinic activity by NSTX, we have examined the action of NSTX (compound I) and the structurally related compounds (compound II, III and IV) on the nicotine-induced contraction of guinea pig isolated ileum and on specific [3H]nicotine binding in rat forebrain membranes. Among four compounds examined, compound I was the most potent in inhibiting the nicotine-induced contraction of guinea pig isolated ileum (pA2 = 9.1 +/- 0.1, pD2' = 8.0 +/- 0.1) and also in inhibiting specific [3H]nicotine binding in rat forebrain (IC50 = 83 +/- 9 9 nM). Compared to compound I, compound II and III which are devoid of one and two sugars, respectively, in the chemical structure of compound I were 2 or 3 times less potent in the antinicotinic activity in both tissues, and compound IV which lacks bromine in addition to two sugars was two orders of magnitude less potent. Thus, the present study demonstrates that bromine rather than sugar moiety in the chemical structure of compound I (NSTX) is an important determinate of its high affinity for nicotinic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have shown that okadaic acid (OA), isolated from black sponge (Halichondria okadai) causes contraction even in the absence of Ca++ in the saponin-permealized taenia isolated from guinea pig cecum. In the present study, mechanism of action of OA was examined using native actomyosin extracted from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. In the absence of Ca++, OA (0.1-1 microM) induced superprecipitation and increased the Mg++-adenosine triphosphatase activity. The OA-induced superprecipitation was enhanced by Ca++ at a concentration (greater than 0.1 microM) which did not activate the calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) kinase. The effect of OA was not affected by the calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine, at a concentration (100 microM) needed to inhibit the Ca++-induced response, but was inhibited markedly by the nonselective kinase inhibitors, amiloride (1 mM) and K-252a (5 microM). The OA-induced superprecipitation in the absence of Ca++ was accompanied by phosphorylation of the 20 K dalton MLC, which also was enhanced by low concentration of Ca++ (greater than 0.1 microM). OA did not change the phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates the phosphorylated MLC. An activator of Ca++- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (1 microM), did not modulate superprecipitation or phosphorylation of MLC in the presence and absence of OA. Furthermore, inhibitors of Ca++ and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (400 microM) and polymyxin B (100 micrograms/ml), affected neither superprecipitation nor phosphorylation of MLC induced by OA. With a reconstituted system containing purified myosin and MLC kinase, OA induced only slight phosphorylation of MLC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous administration of ketanserin (0.05-5.0 mg/kg) produced bradycardia and a reduction of mean arterial pressure dose-dependently. Renal nerve activity and inferior cardiac nerve activity also were reduced by ketanserin. After i.v. administration, baroreceptor afferent nerve activity did not increase, but actually decrease. Moreover, i.v. and i.c.v. administration of ketanserin caused a decrease in preganglionic adrenal nerve activity accompanied with hypotension and bradycardia. Ketanserin (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and clonidine (3 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced equihypotension and bradycardia. On the other hand, the ketanserin-induced reduction of renal nerve activity was milder than that induced by clonidine. The present findings confirmed that ketanserin has a central sympathoinhibitory action. This central action of ketanserin may play an important role in ketanserin-induced bradycardia and may be partially responsible for ketanserin-induced hypotension.\r"

It is unclear, however, whether this protective effect can be observed at doses less than those needed to markedly inhibit gastric acid secretion. We have developed a single-dose endoscopic assay system of aspirin-induced gastric mucosal injury in normal conscious dogs. In this model, severe gastric mucosal injury and a decrease in the pH of the gastric luminal contents were consistently demonstrated 2 h after the oral administration of 100 mg/kg of aspirin. Pretreatment with three histamine H2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, BMY-25271), prevented both of these effects in a dose-related manner. All three H2 receptor antagonists reduced gastric mucosal injury only at doses that were greater than those required to prevent the aspirin-induced decrease in gastric luminal pH or to inhibit histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in Heidenhain pouch dogs. Plasma levels of aspirin were not altered by histamine H2 receptor antagonism. These results indicate that acid inhibition is an important component of the mechanisms whereby histamine H2 receptor antagonists protect the gastric mucosa from aspirin-induced damage in the dog.\r"

All of these models are associated with significant disadvantages including a variable distribution of lesions, high mortality or a requirement for multiple procedures. We have developed a convenient method of BLM treatment that avoids these difficulties and yields extensive, reproducible pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Osmotic minipumps containing BLM (100 mg/kg) were implanted s.c. in C57Bl/6 mice and the drug was delivered as a continuous s.c. infusion over 1 week. No mortality occurred over the first 5 weeks after pump placement whereas i.v. BLM (80 mg/kg) produced 50% mortality within 2 weeks. BLM given by pump infusion produced a greater increase (P less than .05) in lung hydroxyproline after 6 weeks (70%) than a similar total dose given as multiple s.c. injections (40%). Lungs from pump-treated mice showed confluent subpleural fibrosis involving almost 50% of the pleural surface and evidence of subpleural alveolar collapse. Mice receiving i.v. or s.c. injections showed involvement of only 10 to 15% of the pleural surface. BALB/c mice were resistant to pulmonary fibrosis after pump implantation, indicating a murine strain difference in pulmonary responsiveness to BLM administered by constant infusion. This superior model for drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis uses a single procedure and provides an extensive, reproducible lung lesion. Additionally, our studies suggest that dysfunction of the pulmonary epithelium may play an important role in progressive pulmonary disease after BLM treatment.\r"

An increase and decrease in the number of channel bursts were elicited by flunitrazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, respectively. The effects of both drugs were antagonized by ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5][1,4] -benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (flumazenil), a benzodiazepine antagonist, which per se failed to modify Cl- channel kinetics and conductance.\r"

  ".W": "The use of the antiarrhythmic agents mexiletine and quinidine in combination can be clinically beneficial when single agent therapy is ineffective in ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We therefore compared the effects of mexiletine (10 microM), quinidine (10 microM) and a series of their combinations (total concentration 10 microM) in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers driven at a wide range of stimulation frequencies. All treatments depressed Vmax in tissues driven rapidly (cycle length 300 msec), but only with greater than or equal to 5 microM quinidine was Vmax depressed at longer cycle lengths. Moreover, the time constants for development of and recovery from frequency-dependent block were different: short (200-500 msec) for mexiletine, long (3-5 sec) for quinidine and intermediate or biexponential for the combination. Although both drugs depressed Vmax (albeit with different time dependencies), action potential duration at all cycle lengths from 300 to 8000 msec was shortened by mexiletine, lengthened by quinidine and largely unaltered by combinations. Fibers treated with quinidine in low Ko and driven at slow rates developed marked action potential prolongation and abnormal automaticity in the form of early afterdepolarizations; the addition of mexiletine was sufficient to reverse this effect. In summary, mexiletine and quinidine produced different and frequency-dependent effects on depolarization and repolarization. The effects of their combinations reflected these actions, with opposing actions on repolarization at any stimulation rate but additive frequency-dependent depression of Vmax. We conclude that the clinically beneficial effects of this combination may reflect additive frequency-dependent effects on cardiac sodium channels in the face of unaltered repolarization time.\r"

In anesthetized dogs, ACC-9358 converted ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm at a cumulative dose equal to encainide or flecainide and less than disopyramide. In 24-hr coronary artery ligated dogs, ACC-9358 suppressed spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias for up to 6 hr after oral or i.v. administration. The antiarrhythmic effect and plasma concentrations of ACC-9358 correlated well for both oral (r = 0.88) and i.v. (r = 0.87) administration. ACC-9358, flecainide and disopyramide were equieffective in converting crush-stimulation-induced atrial flutter in anesthetized dogs to normal sinus rhythm. In alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, closed-chest dogs, ACC-9358 slowed impulse conduction through the atria, atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system and ventricles and prolonged atrial functional refractory period. In conscious dogs, ACC-9358 increased heart rate, reduced stroke volume and had no effect on mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output. In alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, ACC-9358-induced sinus tachycardia was unaffected by propranolol but was blocked by hexamethonium or vagotomy. In isolated cat ventricular muscle, the IC50 for the negative inotropic effect of ACC-9358 was significantly greater than flecainide or disopyramide. These results indicate that ACC-9358 is a potent, broad-spectrum, long-acting, orally and intravenously active class Ic antiarrhythmic agent that 1) may be devoid of active metabolites, 2) exerts little or no vascular effects and 3) has less direct cardiodepressant activity than flecainide or disopyramide.\r"

We found that PAF is a potent negative inotropic agent (EC50 approximately equal to 160 pM), whose action is unmodified by atropine, indomethacin and the leukotriene receptor antagonist compound FPL 55712. The negative inotropic effect of PAF was, however, antagonized by drugs known to inhibit PAF-induced platelet aggregation: the order of relative potency was SRI 63-441 greater than CV-3988 greater than alprazolam greater than or equal to triazolam; i.e., the same order in which these compounds antagonize the effects of PAF on platelets. Thus, the potent negative inotropic effect of PAF on human myocardium is independent of coronary flow changes, involves neither cholinergic mechanisms nor arachidonate metabolites and is probably mediated by specific receptors.\r"

Domestic pigs received single i.v. or p.o. doses of midazolam (1 mg/kg) or flurazepam (2 mg/kg), two benzodiazepine derivatives with high presystemic extraction after p.o. dosage. Multiple blood samples were simultaneously drawn from the portal vein and from a systemic vein during 8 hr after dosage. After i.v. administration, both drugs had high systemic serum clearance, averaging 24 ml/min/kg. Area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) for systemic vs. portal sites was nearly identical for midazolam (769 vs. 737 ng/ml x hr); for flurazepam, systemic AUC exceeded portal AUC (1035 vs. 778 ng/ml x hr, P less than .01). After p.o. dosage, the systemic/portal AUC ratio averaged 0.15 for midazolam and 0.11 for flurazepam; for both drugs, portal AUC after p.o. dosage did not differ significantly from systemic AUC after i.v. administration. Thus, the extensive presystemic extraction of orally administered midazolam and flurazepam are mainly attributable to hepatic biotransformation rather than metabolism either within the gastrointestinal tract or during absorption into the portal circulation.\r"

Twitch responses were produced with rectangular-wave stimuli (0.5 msec; 10 Hz; 4.8-12 V) delivered in 1-sec trains every 10 sec. After addition of pyrilamine to block H1-mediated contractions, histamine and N alpha-methylhistamine (NMH) inhibited the twitch responses with EC50 values of 64 and 1.7 nM, respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in potency between histamine and NMH at contractile H1 receptors in ileum longitudinal muscle or at chronotropic H2 receptors in the atria. Impromidine blocked the inhibitory effect of NMH in a competitive manner with a KB value of 26 nM, whereas inhibition caused by gamma-aminobutyric acid or by adenosine remained unaffected by impromidine. At concentrations that completely prevented the electrically induced twitch, NMH did not alter contractions produced by exogenous acetylcholine. Inhibitory responses to NMH were unaffected by cimetidine, hexamethonium, combined alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade, naloxone, 8-phenyltheophylline or gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor desensitization. These data support the presence of inhibitory histamine receptors in the ileum that are pharmacologically similar to the presynaptic H3 autoreceptors found in rat cortex. The distribution of H3 receptors, therefore, may not be confined to the central nervous system and their function, as with alpha-2 adrenergic sites, may not be limited to that of an autoreceptor.\r"

Histamine secretory rates were evaluated by measuring the arterial and gastric venous plasma histamine concentrations at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min into pentagastrin infusions, and gastric blood flow was continuously monitored. Histamine secretory rates were calculated by subtracting the arterial from the venous histamine concentrations and multiplying the difference by gastric plasma flow. Two separate 20-min infusions of pentagastrin, separated by 60 min, resulted in a peak of histamine release in 5 to 10 min that returned to base line within 20 min. During the first infusion, histamine release peaked at 179 ng/min, whereas, during the second infusion, histamine peaked at 125 ng/ml. The increase in gastric blood flow to pentagastrin correlated with the increases in histamine release. Somatostatin infused into the gastric artery to attain a concentration of 10 nM, a concentration that results in the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, abolished the gastric histamine release to pentagastrin. In addition, somatostatin also attenuated the gastric vasodilation to pentagastrin. Our data indicate that, in the in vivo dog model, pentagastrin can cause a pulsed release of gastric histamine, and somatostatin inhibits this release of histamine.\r"

Because parathyroid hormone is known to affect phospholipid metabolism, the plasma membrane binding and tissue accumulation of gentamicin were examined as a function of the parathyroid hormone status of the animal. The experiments were conducted by evaluating the parameters in isolated brush border and basolateral membranes from control, hyper- and hypoparathyroid rats. Scatchard analysis revealed that [125I]gentamicin bound with equal affinity to either membrane to a single class of noninteracting sites. The basolateral membrane had more binding sites than did the brush border, 28 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. Neither the affinity constants nor the number of binding sites were affected by the parathyroid hormone status of the donor animal. On the other hand, in the hypoparathyroid state the amount and the rate of gentamicin accumulation were less than in the hyperparathyroid state. The difference in accumulation cannot be explained on the basis of a change in the number or affinity of the putative receptor. Therefore, the alteration must reflect some difference subsequent to the binding site.\r"

The nature of this effect is unknown. Intravascular fibrin, also a common finding in lung injury, is degraded to small peptides by proteolytic enzymes. Peptide 6A, corresponding to amino acid residues 43 to 47 of the B beta chain of fibrin(ogen), is produced by plasmin degradation of fibrin and has been shown to inhibit ACE in vitro. We investigated the effect of this peptide on the pulmonary hydrolysis of a synthetic ACE substrate, benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline, in anesthetized rabbits and in isolated, perfused rabbit lungs. Peptide 6A caused a reversible, dose-dependent inhibition of benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline hydrolysis. It also potentiated the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and the decrease in systemic arterial pressure due to bradykinin (BK), as well as the increase in pulmonary artery pressure due to BK in isolated lungs. The amount of BK needed to increase pulmonary arterial pressure was about 1000-fold larger in the isolated lung than in the intact animal. Peptides of this type might contribute to decreased ACE activity in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and may potentiate BK-mediated hemodynamic changes in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory showed an atropine-sensitive component in the hyperresponsiveness of ragweed-sensitized canine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) in vitro to histamine and potassium. The present studies were undertaken to elucidate the nature of the parasympathetic element in this hyperresponsiveness. TSM strips were dissected from ragweed-sensitized and littermate control dogs and their isometric force generation was measured in vitro. Mechanical responses of sensitized TSM were characterized by hyperreactivity (upward shift of the dose-response relationship) to acetylcholine (ACh), atropine-sensitive spontaneous base line activity and prolonged isometric force plateaus. Control TSM did not contract spontaneously and basal tone was maintained passively. However, eserine could produce spontaneous base-line activity and prolonged isometric force plateau in control TSM that mimicked that observed naturally in sensitized TSM. Sensitized TSM was supersensitive (leftward shift of the dose-response relationship) to ACh and electrical field stimulation, and showed a significant leftward shift of the threshold dose to carbamylcholine (carbachol). However, sensitized and control TSMs were equally reactive to carbachol at doses of 10(-8) M and greater. Also, ACh dose-response curves of sensitized and control TSMs in the presence of the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine (10(-8) M) showed no significant differences in sensitivity or reactivity. These results were consistent with a role for local parasympathetic mechanisms such as altered ACh release and/or breakdown in the hyperresponsiveness of ragweed-sensitized canine TSM.\r"

[3H]LTD4 bound specifically and rapidly (Kon = 0.29 +/- 0.6 nM-1.min-1) reaching equilibrium within 15 min. The rate of binding was greatly inhibited in the presence of ICI 198,615. Excess LTD4 or ICI 198,615 slowly (t1/2 = 20 min) dissociated about 70% of the receptor-bound [3H]LTD4, whereas in combination with GTP analogs, both induced a rapid (t1/2 less than 5 min) and full dissociation. Equilibrium saturation analysis of [3H]LTD4 binding demonstrated a saturable (Bmax = 1014 +/- 174 fmol/mg) and high affinity (Kd = 0.43 +/- 0.09 nM) binding site. A high degree of stereoselectivity was demonstrated with inhibition of binding by the stereoisomers of LTD4: S,R much greater than R,R greater than R,S much greater than S,S. The rank order for inhibition of binding by peptide leukotriene was: LTD4 greater than 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-cysteinyl-7(E),9(E),11(Z),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid much greater than 5(S)hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7(E),9(E),11(Z),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (potency ratios were: 1:4:590). In competition assays, ICI 198,615 competitively inhibited binding of [3H]LTD4 (Ki = 0.27 +/- 0.16 nM) and was 2300-fold and 3100-fold more potent than LY171883 or FPL55712. These data, together with results obtained previously in functional receptor assays, illustrate that this new class of leukotriene antagonists are the most potent and selective competitive antagonists of LTD4 receptors yet described.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral nerves as well as chromaffin cells have been shown to contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36 amino acid peptide that exhibits potent stimulatory actions on vascular smooth muscle. Because NPY-like immunoreactive material (NPY-IR) is stored in chromaffin granules we chose to investigate, using the retrogradely perfused bovine adrenal gland, whether nicotinic cholinergic receptor stimulation results in the secretion of this material. In addition we monitored the release of [Met5]-enkephalin-like immunoreactive material (ME-IR), which has been demonstrated to be released from the bovine adrenal medulla. NPY-IR and ME-IR were measured using antisera prepared from hemocyanin conjugates of the peptides. Increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (1 X 10(-6) M-5 X 10(-5) M), infused in the presence of 1 X 10(-5) M physostigmine, produced significant increases in NPY-IR and ME-IR release. Hexamethonium (5 X 10(-4) M) antagonized the release of both of these substances, whereas atropine (5 X 10(-7) M) did not. The role of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor in this process was established further by examining the effects of 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium. Increasing concentrations of 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (1 X 10(-6) M-5 X 10(-5) M) also stimulated the release of NPY-IR and ME-IR. Analysis of the perfusate by reverse phase liquid chromatography revealed the presence of four peaks of NPY-IR. A major peak coeluted with authentic NPY. These data demonstrate that NPY-IR can be released through stimulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor. The adrenal medulla appears to be one of the sources for circulating NPY-IR.\r"

Oxazepam (10-30 mg/kg i.p.) also was tested. Concentration- or dose-related increases in ETOH-lever responding were observed with toluene, halothane, TCE and oxazepam. Shared discriminative stimulus properties among toluene, halothane, TCE and ETOH indicate that some volatile inhalants share pharmacological properties with ETOH. Previous research has shown that these inhalants also produce pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects in mice. Thus, at least some inhaled anesthetics and abused solvents have behavioral effects in common with abused central nervous system depressant drugs such as ETOH and barbiturates.\r"

Additivity was assessed using a simplified version of isobolographic analysis using chlorpromazine and haloperidol as positive controls for dose-additivity. Dosage-effect functions for all compounds were determined for both motor activity and the ASR. The effects of various combinations of chlorpromazine (0.5-4.0 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) on motor activity indicate dose-addition. To test for dose-addition of pyrethroids and GABAergic compounds, cismethrin (3-18 mg/kg) or deltamethrin (2-6 mg/kg) were administered 90 min before testing, either alone, or before treatment with picrotoxin (0.25-2.0 mg/kg), muscimol (0.6-2.5 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg) administered 20 to 30 min before testing. All compounds produced dosage-dependent decreases in motor activity. Muscimol and picrotoxin decreased ASR amplitude, increased ASR latency and reduced ASR sensitization to increasing background noise levels. Chlordiazepoxide had no effect on any measure of the ASR. Results from the interaction studies indicate dose-addition of the effects of picrotoxin and deltamethrin on motor activity and the ASR. Additivity of dose was not seen with any other combination. These data suggest that the in vivo effects of the Type II pyrethroid deltamethrin may be due in part to interaction with the picrotoxinin binding site of the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex. In addition, these results are consistent with reported differential effects of the two classes of pyrethroids on the GABAA receptor complex.\r"

The distribution of all three compounds was modeled with three-compartment systems in which the central compartment corresponds to intravascular space. The total volume of theophylline distribution averaged 0.72 +/- 0.09 liters/kg (+/- S.D.), indicating net tissue binding as reflected in a tissue/intracellular water partition coefficient of 1.17 +/- 0.10. Cardiac output measurements averaged 4.78 +/- 0.95 liters/min and were similar to the sum of compartmental blood flows estimated from the intercompartmental clearances of urea and inulin (4.62 +/- 1.10 liters/min) and to the sum of theophylline intercompartmental clearances (5.10 +/- 1.29 liters/min). Theophylline intercompartmental clearance to each peripheral compartment was faster than expected from its free-water diffusion coefficient and was similar to estimated compartmental blood flow. It is possible that theophylline transcapillary exchange is carrier mediated and that its rapidity contributes to the frequency of adverse reactions after i.v. administration of this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions of the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone, with serotonin (5-HT) were studied using behavioral and neurochemical procedures. Punished responding was studied in pigeons as this behavior is a generally acknowledged preclinical predictor of anxiolytic activity and because buspirone increases punished responding of pigeons with greater potency and efficacy than in other species. Keypeck responses were maintained under either fixed-interval or fixed-ratio schedules of food presentation; every 30th response produced a brief electric shock and suppressed responding (punishment). Buspirone (0.1-5.6 mg/kg i.m.) produced dose-related increases in punished responding which reached a maximum at 1 mg/kg. A serotonin agonist, MK-212 (0.01 mg/kg), antagonized whereas the 5-HT antagonist, cyproheptadine (0.01 mg/kg), potentiated the effects of buspirone without having behavioral effects of their own. The characteristics of [3H]-5-HT binding in pigeon brain membranes were similar to results reported in mammalian brain. Neither buspirone, MJ-13805 (gepirone, a related analog), nor MJ-13653 (a buspirone metabolite), significantly affected [3H]-5-HT binding and none of the compounds appreciably inhibited uptake of [3H]-5-HT into pigeon cerebral synaptosomes. Hill coefficients significantly less than unity for all drugs except 5-HT suggested multiple serotonergic binding sites for buspirone and analogs. Buspirone and MJ-13805 (1 nM) inhibited [3H]ketanserin binding (a measure of 5-HT2 binding sites) in pigeon cerebrum with Ki values above 10(-6) M. The number of [3H]ketanserin binding sites was estimated to be 109 fmol/mg of protein in pigeon cerebrum compared to 400 fmol/mg of protein in rat cerebrum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Drug effects were assessed with objective performance tasks, subject estimates of performance, staff ratings of drug effects and subject ratings of drug effects, sleep, mood, drug liking and monetary street value. Generally, both LZ and MEP produced comparable dose-related effects; LZ had a more rapid onset of action and on several measures showed a more shallow dose-response curve than MEP. With LZ, but not MEP, subjects under-estimated the degree to which their performance was impaired and under-rated drug effects as compared to analogous staff ratings. Both drugs produced sedation-like subject ratings of mood and sleep but generally did not produce tranquilization-like ratings. MEP produced subject ratings of drug liking and monetary street value which were equal to or in some cases greater than those of LZ. Relative potency estimations showed that LZ was 510 to 783 times more potent than MEP in producing performance impairment but was only 370 times more potent than MEP in producing subject ratings of drug liking. Overall, these data indicate that the likelihood of abuse of MEP is at least equal to if not greater than that of LZ although LZ may have a greater likelihood of producing adverse behavioral effects such as a performance impairment and under-estimates of the degree of impairment. These data in conjunction with previous results from this laboratory show that the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines can be differentiated from those of other types of sedative/anxiolytics and that MEP displays characteristics of a barbiturate-like profile of action.\r"

  ".U": "88090565\r", 
  ".W": "[3H]Dihydroergotamine (DE) labels a population of binding sites in rat brain membranes with an affinity of approximately 70 pM in both hippocampus (maximal binding at saturation [Bmax] = 340 fmol/mg of protein) and cerebral cortex (Bmax = 250 fmol/mg of protein). Specific binding typically comprises about 97% of total binding at the Kd of the radioligand when nonspecific binding is determined in the presence of 100 nM unlabeled DE. Association kinetics at 37 degrees C are consistent with a uniform association rate constant for all sites labeled. Specific binding is completely reversible with addition of excess unlabeled DE, but dissociation does not proceed with simple first-order kinetics, suggesting the presence of more than one discrete binding site. Competition studies with selective drugs reveal alpha adrenergic, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B components of [3H]DE specific binding. When phentolamine (500 nM) is included to block alpha receptors and DPAT (100 nM) or spiroxatrine (500 nM) is included to block 5-HT1A receptors, specific binding is exclusively to sites with drug affinities characteristic of 5-HT1B receptors. Under these 5-HT1B-selective conditions, [3H]DE binding is about 90% specific, with a Kd of about 50 to 60 pM and a Bmax of 96 fmol/mg of protein in hippocampus and 77 fmol/mg of protein in cortex. [3H]DE binding to 5-HT1B sites is very slowly dissociable, with a T1/2 of greater than 2 h at 37 degrees C. 5-HT1B antagonists and DE itself yield competition curves at [3H]DE-labeled 5-HT1B sites that are adequately fit assuming a single site in nonlinear regression analysis. Competition by the agonists 5-HT and RU 24969 at 5-HT1B sites are often best described by two site fits. Addition of 100 microM guanylyl 5'-imidodiphosphate appears to convert nearly all 5-HT1B sites to those having low affinity for agonists while having a much smaller effect on the binding of [3H]DE. This suggests that the 5-HT1B site exists in two interconvertable agonist affinity states and is yet another member of the G-protein-linked receptor family. In agreement with previous studies using other radioligands, no 5-HT1B sites can be detected in bovine, porcine or human hippocampus membranes.\r"

A hypovolemic-traumatic (soft-tissue trauma together with bone fractures) baboon model with reinfusion was established to study these morphologic and associated pathophysiologic events. This model was developed in order to test the efficacy of therapeutic modalities in future studies. Nineteen baboons (eight sham, 11 shock) were anesthetized with spontaneous respiration while complete hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring was performed, along with light and electron microscopic studies of the lungs. Besides the usual shock-related hemodynamic disturbances and the metabolic acidosis, pathologic changes were found both on light and electron microscopy of the lungs but not on X-rays and measurements of blood oxygenation. In the shock group, morphologic evidence of endothelial and interstitial edema was associated with significant increases in lung weight. The fluid accumulation occurred in spite of careful control of pulmonary artery pressures during the study. More striking histologic findings were significant cellular infiltration of lung tissue, especially by leukocytes, showing evidence of degranulation. This baboon study, similar to studies undertaken in canines, shows that the hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock in association with trauma (fracture, soft-tissue trauma) causes ultrastructural morphologic changes that may precede potentially life-threatening functional changes in the lung.\r"

All six patients were males averaging 26 years of age and all six were involved in motor vehicle accidents. Concomitant associated injuries were common. Two femoral and five tibial fractures were open. All fractures were stabilized within 24 hours of injury by closed intramedullary nailing with Ender nails. At final followup, there was one femoral and one tibial nonunion in the same patient. For the remaining patients, femoral union averaged 10.3 weeks and tibial union averaged 18 weeks. Five patients regained full motion at the hip, and four regained full motion at the knee and ankle. Four patients returned to their preinjury level of function; two were less active, one ambulating without the use of external assistive devices, and one using a cane.\r"

  ".W": "In 24 military recruits vaccinated against tetanus 17-20 years earlier antibody responses were studied 4, 11, and 24 days after revaccination. Antitoxin concentration in serum showed a sigmoid increase with titres at day 4 only just above protective level, corresponding to a risk of susceptibility to be expected even 4 days after revaccination (2.0%, 95% confidence limit). Only after 7 days the risk of unprotection was less than 1%. As the incubation period of tetanus can be as short as 24 hours, revaccination only may not be regarded sufficient if more than 17-20 years have elapsed since primary vaccination and conditions favoring rapid development of tetanus are present. The findings may explain some of the cases of tetanus which have occurred in spite of primary vaccination supplemented by emergency booster. The statement that prophylactic tetanus immunoglobulin is never indicated to persons completely vaccinated earlier should be considered for revision.\r"

Using such a microcomputer-based system, we developed a practical approach to the storage and retrieval of vascular surgical references, which permits virtually unlimited numbers of articles to be catalogued and quickly retrieved with multiple search parameters. This system has been operational in our Division of Vascular Surgery for nearly a year and currently contains more than 3000 journal articles that are readily available for resident teaching, patient care, and research.\r"

Follow-up ranging from 3 to 132 months was obtained for all patients. In this period, six patients suffered a cerebrovascular accident and five had further hemispheric TIAs. These results are in contrast to our earlier data, which suggested a benign prognosis in this group of patients. Results of this updated study show that the prognosis of patients with hemispheric TIAs and normal angiograms is not so benign as originally reported. Those patients with multiple events before initial evaluation are at increased risk of subsequent cerebrovascular accident or TIA. Close observation of this group of patients is recommended.\r"

While the aorta was clamped, blood was withdrawn through the venous cannula, and oxygenated blood was delivered to the legs through the arterial cannula. This procedure allowed clamping and unclamping of the aorta to proceed without hemodynamic fluctuation. Intraoperatively, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were measured. Both patients recovered, which indicates that this technique may be safely undertaken in the severely compromised patient with cardiac disease.\r"

  ".W": "Renal cell carcinoma extends into the inferior vena cava in 5% of patients undergoing exploratory surgery for this malignancy. If the tumor is left unresected, death within 1 year is certain. In addition, caval occlusion may result in massive lower extremity edema, ascites, hepatic failure, and pulmonary embolus. During the past 17 years, 12 patients with renal cell carcinoma extending into the inferior vena cava were treated at a single institution by radical nephrectomy and caval tumor extraction. There were 10 men (83%) and ages ranged from 50 to 78 years (mean 63 years). There was one operative death (8%) caused by refractory coagulopathy. Long-term follow-up was achieved for all survivors. One- and 3-year survival rates by life-table method were 73% and 27%, respectively. Mean survival time after resection was 32 months. Careful preoperative planning is essential. The optimal approach for venacaval tumor extraction or resection is dictated by the cephalad extent of tumor seen on preoperative thoracoabdominal CT scan, ultrasound, or inferior venacavography. Disease limited to the infrahepatic vena cava is best approached with a thoracoabdominal incision through the eighth intercostal space. Extension of tumor to the hepatic veins or right atrium requires median sternotomy in combination with an abdominal incision for complete removal. An ellipse of vena cava around the origin of the renal vein is excised with the specimen. The resultant incision is closed by lateral phleborrhaphy. Late sequelae of the mild caval narrowing were not observed. An aggressive multispecialty surgical policy for caval extraction and resection of renal cell carcinoma resulted in extended patient survival and excellent palliation.\r"

Lodoxamide (20 mg/kg/hr) or 0.9% sodium chloride was infused beginning 15 minutes before infrarenal aortic occlusion and continuing for 105 minutes. With an occlusion time of 20 minutes, eight of eight lodoxamide-treated animals and five of eight saline-treated animals regained function after reperfusion. However, by 48 hours after occlusion, seven of eight saline-treated animals were completely paralyzed, whereas only two of eight lodoxamide-treated animals were paralyzed. An ischemia time of 30 minutes exceeded the protective capacity of this treatment. These results suggest lodoxamide may be useful in alleviating ischemic damage to the spinal cord.\r"

Thirty variables were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. Statistically significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were noted for 12 of 30 factors when analyzed with univariate tests. Multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that elevation of the unmeasured anion gap, a history of congestive heart failure, and the patient's level of consciousness before operation were significantly and independently associated with death. Coefficients generated from this model allowed stratification of patients into four risk groups with respective mortality rates of 100%, 75%, 28%, and 12%. We conclude that it is possible to assign a mortality risk score to individual cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on the basis of readily available clinical and laboratory parameters. A prospective study to address this question seems justified.\r"

It was charged to provide recommendations regarding vascular surgical manpower requirements for the next 15 years. Analysis of National Center for Health Statistics vascular operative rate data and 1690 questionnaire responses from vascular surgeons documented that vascular surgeons performed 235,400 (41%) of the total of 571,000 vascular operations undertaken in 1985. Vascular surgeons performed 87% of 30,000 aortoiliofemoral reconstructions, 77% of 72,000 peripheral vessel bypasses, 75% of 33,000 abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, 59% of 55,000 angioaccess procedures, and 50% of 107,000 carotid endarterectomies. However, lack of accurate data on caseloads of surgeons who were not vascular specialists precludes precise prediction of manpower requirements for vascular surgery. It is important that surgical leaders and policy makers define the types of vascular surgical procedures that may be undertaken by vascular and other surgeons. Ongoing analyses must include such determinations to establish accurate data for the prediction of future manpower needs for vascular surgery. Furthermore, future manpower studies should be linked to outcome studies to assess not only numbers of surgeons and operations but quality of care as well.\r"

On the other hand, with respect to recurrence of gastric cancer that had developed in the lung or bone, Borrmann type 3 and 4, respectively, were more frequently observed. In these cases, microscopic analysis revealed that these cancers were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. In gastric cancer with bone recurrence, the rate of recurrence of the scirrhous type of tumor were higher than that of other types.

Curves for three subclasses of the greater than or equal to 4 positive node group (4-6, 7-12, and greater than or equal to 13) were similar in overall survival, but were significantly (P = 0.04) different for disease-free interval, due to a rapid rate of recurrence in the greater than or equal to 13 positive node group.

These findings support the thesis that a significant proportion of negative nodes patients are cured by mastectomy and that a smaller group of node-positive patients have regional disease with a chance of cure by mastectomy.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transverse colostomy after induction with dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and the excluded distal colon was irrigated with saline or sodium cholate (23 microM) 5 times per week until sacrifice. Controls initially injected with saline were similarly treated. All surviving animals were sacrificed at 28 weeks after the last DMH injection. Five animals from each group were randomly chosen to assess tritiated thymidine labeling and distribution by autoradiography in normal appearing colon mucosa of irrigated bowel. Cholate irrigation failed to increase tumor yield or modify the proportion of adenomas and adenocarcinomas in this model. Paradoxically, fewer tumors per affected rat were noted with sodium cholate irrigation. Cholate irrigation also failed to affect crypt cellularity, thymidine labeling indices, and labeling distribution in DMH-treated rats and controls. An effect of DMH was seen, however, with an increase in thymidine labeling index and increased labeling in the top half of the crypt in all DMH-treated groups. This study suggests that tumor promotion with primary bile salts is not a direct affect and may result from further bile salt metabolism within the fecal stream. DMH-induced changes in cell proliferation were reproduced with this model. Use of an excluded colon segment to assess the effect of suspected tumor promoters on carcinogenesis or colon mucosal cell proliferation is feasible and may be a useful model for future studies.\r"

The percent of cells in the S phase was significantly increased in the patients with metastasis compared to those without metastasis. Patients exhibiting percent S phase value of more than 20% showed a high frequency of metastasis even when breast tumors were small (T1, less than 2.0 cm in diameter). Thus, flow cytometric analysis may give additional information on biological characteristics and may be useful for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer in some patients.\r"

Particular attention was given to: (a) detect possible delay in diagnosing gastric cancer; (b) ascertain the frequency of association with epithelial dysplasia; (c) establish the role of markers, such as serum pepsinogen group I (PGI), and gastric juice CEA in predicting gastric ulcer evolution. Endoscopic and bioptic check-ups were carried out during the first year at 3, 6 and 12 months after endoscopic healing of the ulcer, and then at every symptomatic recurrence. Ten patients (6.9%) were found to present histological evidence of malignancy (within 3 months in six cases, between 6 and 12 months in three cases, and after 41 months in the rest). Four cases were early gastric cancers, and six had shown dysplastic changes of the mucosa at the edge or scar of the ulcer. Serum PGI levels were not significantly different in gastric cancer patients, while gastric juice CEA levels were sharply increased compared to those of gastric ulcer patients: nine out of ten patients had values above normal range. These data suggest that: (a) there may be some delay in diagnosing gastric carcinoma, and gastric ulcer patients should be controlled routinely more than once; (b) the presence of dysplasia indicates the need for prolonged follow-up, because of the high risk of association with or evolution into gastric cancer, and because of the higher number of early gastric cancer detections that this protocol allows; (c) further support in monitoring patients \"at risk\" may be afforded by gastric juice CEA determination.\r"

By light microscopy, the tumor contained cellular patterns similar to those present in tumors of mesenchymal origin. Spindle cell areas arranged in a storiform pattern were present. Ultrastructurally, bundles of cytoplasmic microfilaments were present in the cell cytoplasm and were similar in distribution to those found on fine structural examination in tumors of mesenchymal origin. Rows of desmosomes were found between cells supporting an epithelial origin for this tumor. Following initial therapy, metastatic tumor produced polypoid lesions in the small intestine resulting in recurrent small bowel intussuceptions. Our findings indicate that sarcomatoid carcinoma of the pancreas, by both light and ultrastructural examination, is a heterogenous tumor at the cellular level and may be a cause of repeated intussuception when intraluminal compromise occurs.\r"

Twenty percent had failed previous systemic chemotherapy. Seventeen who were symptomatic received additional radiotherapy. Metastasis was confined to the liver in 38, while 15 also had extrahepatic metastases. Median survival for those with hepatic metastases only was 21 months from diagnosis and 16 months from catheter insertion. There are three long-term survivors in this group, alive 58, 69, and 86 months, respectively, from diagnosis. Median survival for those with hepatic and extrahepatic metastases was 10 months from diagnosis and 6 months from catheter insertion. No patient in this group has survived long term. Catheter-related complications occurred in 20% of the patients; none were fatal. Drug toxicities were minor.

The mean age was 36 with a range of 1 to 77 years of age. The most common histologic subtypes were rhabdomyosarcoma (19%), malignant fibrohistiocytoma (13%), fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (12% each), and liposarcoma (10%). Among the 42 soft tissue sarcomas 33% occurred in the trunk, 35% and 21% in the lower and upper extremities, and 10% in the head and neck region. Among the 25 visceral sarcomas, 16% were in the thorax, 56% involved abdominal or retroperitoneal organs, and 28% were in the head and neck region. Overall, 33 of the 54 patients with early sarcomas were treated by surgical resection alone while 21 others had postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Factors influencing survival are presented and patterns of metastasis discussed. Overall, 45% of the patients showed metastatic disease either at diagnosis (15%) or during the follow-up period (30%). The lung was involved in two-thirds of the cases and was the most common site of spread. In patients with rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant fibrohistiocytoma, regional lymph node metastasis was noted in 36% and 17%, respectively.\r"

Pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO and indices of CO2 exchange were similar in both groups. Arterial partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) was significantly lower and alveolar-arterial O2 difference was significantly higher in coalminers than in controls, both at rest and during exercise. There was no relation between lung function and radiological signs of simple pneumoconiosis (10 coalminers had pneumoconiosis). The differences in FEV1 (0.42 l) and in PaO2 (10 mm Hg) between the two groups are the same or larger than those usually found between smokers and non-smokers. Exposure to coaldust may result in biologically significant alterations of lung function even in the absence of pneumoconiosis.\r"

Conventional techniques of chlamydial culture are unsuitable for large field surveys in developing countries. In this study an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed for the detection of chlamydial antigen in genital-tract infection was used in trachoma. Conjunctival swabs were taken for chlamydial antigen detection from 1225 subjects in a Gambian village with endemic trachoma. Of these, 997 had insignificant or no disease and 172 had mild, 30 moderate, and 26 severe disease. Chlamydial antigen was detected in 5.0%, 20.3%, 46.7%, and 26.9% of subjects in these four categories, respectively. Samples for chlamydial isolation were obtained from 259 subjects. The corresponding rates of detection obtained by chlamydial isolation were 3/90 (3.3%), 16/129 (12.4%), 7/21 (33.3%), and 7/19 (36.8%). If isolation is taken as the \"gold standard\", the EIA technique had a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 90%. A substantial proportion of subjects with severe conjunctival scarring, from whom chlamydiae cannot generally be isolated, were antigen positive by EIA, implying that persistent chlamydial antigen plays a part in the pathogenesis of the late sequelae of trachoma.\r"

In vitro measurements demonstrated that a repetitively pulsed organic dye laser transmitted through a small diameter quartz fiber can recanalize an occluded stent in less than 10 sec without causing visible damage to the stent. The laser parameters required for recanalization do not result in significant damage to the common bile duct of a pig even when the laser energy is delivered directly into the tissue, indicating that biliary endoprostheses can be cleared with a large margin of safety. Although the duration of this effect is unknown, pulsed laser radiation is a simple, safe, and effective means of recanalizing occluded biliary endoprostheses and may be an alternative to stent replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsed lasers produce a variety of therapeutically useful effects in tissues by thermal mechanisms. In contrast with conventional hyperthermia, pulsed lasers rapidly induce extremely high temperatures confined to small areas within the tissues. It is not established, however, how cellular damage and repair responses differ between conventional and pulsed laser-induced hyperthermia. We have addressed this question by examining the induction of cellular heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and protection by heat-shock response against pulsed laser vs conventional hyperthermia. Cultured human dermal fibroblasts at confluency were exposed to single microsecond, 10.6-microns-wavelength pulses from a pulsed CO2 laser at radiant exposures between 0 and 1.3 J/cm2. Cell monolayers were directly exposed after removal of overlying medium. Positive control for the ability of the cells to synthesize of HSPs was obtained by heating the cells for 20 min in a water bath at 45 degrees C or 47 degrees C. The cultures were then labeled with L-[35S] methionine (Met), and proteins analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2 hr after exposure. The morphological alterations induced by laser or heat were similar under phase contrast microscopy. Conventional heating induced a heat-shock response, with the appearance of HSPs 2 hours after heating. In contrast, synthesis of HSPs could not be detected following laser irradiation, even at exposures decreasing both cell viability and incorporation of [35S] Met into cellular protein. Pre-exposure of cells to temperatures which induced synthesis of HSPs, however, significantly decreased cell death induced by subsequent laser irradiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A theoretical analysis of 2,100 light rays in large bulb end (output end) fibers compared to a standard flat end fiber showed (1) a much higher-intensity focus; (2) a 125.4% increase in number of output rays (with respect to number of input rays) in the convergent output beam, due to multiple reflections/refractions (\"stars\" and \"triangles\") and standing waves, in the large bulb end, compared to 48.6% in the flat end; (3) 83.69% energy in the converging beam of the large bulb end, compared to 46.1% energy in the flat end; and (4) a rapidly divergent beam after focus. Hence, theoretically a wide area of plaque could be burnt off more rapidly with less heat conduction into the vessel walls. Coupling efficiency was experimentally shown to be greatly increased by also having a bulb at the optic fiber input end.\r"

Lased sites were examined histologically at 24 hr or at 3 months after treatment. No effect was seen at 1.5 Joules. Three to six Joules tangentially produced a superficial lesion that extended into the tunica intima. Six Joules perpendicularly produced a burn into the tunica adventitia, with damage to the vasavasorum. Nine Joules tangentially produced a burn into the tunica media. Three months after treatment, this lased site showed no stenosis or aneurysm formation.\r"

Bipolar plunge electrodes were placed at thoracotomy into the left ventricular endocardium in nine anesthetized dogs. Ventricular tachycardia was simulated by pacing at 200 beats per minute. After four days of recovery, catheter-directed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser injury was produced at the site of earliest recorded electrical activation during pacing tachycardia as detected by endocardial catheter mapping. Immediately after laser injury and again five days after injury, pacing tachycardia was attempted. Failure to pace after laser injury was defined as successful arrhythmia ablation. In 3/9 (33%) experiments, the laser-injured tissue surrounded the tachycardia source (pacing wires), and pacing-simulated ventricular tachycardia was prevented. When the laser injury did not involve the tachycardia source, 6/9 animals, due to limitations of the mapping system, pacing was not prevented. One animal developed sustained ventricular tachycardia during laser injury, with conversion to sinus rhythm by lidocaine. One animal, without recognized ventricular arrhythmia, died five days after laser injury. No unusual findings were noted at autopsy. These preliminary data suggest that catheter-directed laser-induced injury can ablate arrhythmia sources. Further studies are indicated in a more physiologic model, and the safety and risks of the procedure need further evaluation.\r"

A total of 57 young women have been examined cytologically and colposcopically at least 3, 6, and 12 months following CO2-laser surgery. In 12 women (21%) the lesions were multifocal with the same histological pattern in the cervix and in the vagina and/or in the vulva. CO2-laser effectively eradicates the koilocytotic lesions in the cervix and in the vagina; in the vulva, however, relapses are common after an initial good effect. The diagnostic accuracy of cervicovaginal cytology was low: exfoliated koilocytotic cells were found in only 26.3% out of 57 cases with histologically proven koilocytotic lesion, even when the cytological smears were reexamined.\r"

Ganglion cell activity was recorded in situ by means of an intraocular electrode. Ganglion cells exposed to a single 20-nsec exposure, at a sublesion intensity, produced a 60-90 sec discharge of action potentials and exhibited a 2 log or greater elevation of light threshold, depending on beam size and intensity. At equivalent energy levels, the longer exposures produced the same or slightly weaker effects. This result is not as straightforward as it seems. Submillisecond flashes bleach no more than 50% of the visual pigment because of photoregeneration. The Dowling-Rushton relation predicts that a 50% bleach should produce only a 1.5 log loss of cone sensitivity. Exposures longer than 1 msec should not photoregenerate pigment (ie, more pigment will be bleached for a given exposure intensity). In view of the probable differences in pigment bleaching, it appears that the Q-switched laser light adapts the cells out of proportion to the visual pigment actually bleached--a single-cell analogue of Rushton's \"theta\" effect.\r"

When single serum samples from 92 men were studied, 73 percent had detectable hCG. In normal men, the amount of detectable hCG averaged 8.9 pg per milliliter, with a range of less than 3.0 to 160 pg per milliliter (biologic potency = 13,450 IU per milligram). In postmenopausal women the hCG level averaged 111 pg per milliliter and ranged from 32 to 510. In women of reproductive age the hCG level varied with the menstrual cycle. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone administered to 10 normal men increased both hCG and hLH. When daily serum samples were studied throughout a normal menstrual cycle, hCG concentrations paralleled those of hLH; follicular-phase concentrations were higher than those of the luteal phase, and there was a midcycle ovulatory peak of hCG coincident with the hLH peak. When hCG was measured every 10 minutes for six hours in eight postmenopausal women, distinct pulses were detected in parallel with those of hLH: hLH pulsed at a mean (+/- SEM) frequency of 0.56 +/- 0.08 pulses per hour; hCG pulsed at 0.54 +/- 0.07 pulses per hour. The mean pulse durations were 89 +/- 22 and 56 +/- 20 minutes for hLH and hCG, respectively. We conclude that hCG is produced in a pulsatile fashion, probably by the pituitary, in all normal adults.\r"

Metastases were observed with none of the 127 appendiceal carcinoids less than 2.0 cm in largest dimension, with 3 of the 14 lesions greater than or equal to 2.0 cm but less than 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, and with 4 of the 9 lesions greater than or equal to 3.0 cm. Paradoxically, the patients with the larger tumors and metastases were younger than those with smaller and clinically benign tumors. The median age of patients with tumors greater than or equal to 2.0 cm was 31 years and that of those with metastases was 29 years, as compared with a median age of 42 years in patients with nonmetastasizing tumors less than 2.0 cm. We conclude that simple appendectomy is adequate treatment for patients with apparently localized tumors less than 2.0 cm in largest dimension. We have not observed any recurrences or metastases among 122 such patients followed for a median time of more than 26 years. Simple appendectomy is probably also appropriate treatment for lesions greater than or equal to 2.0 cm in elderly patients or in those at high operative risk. Right hemicolectomy seems justified only in young patients with tumors greater than or equal to 2.0 cm who have a low risk of operative morbidity or mortality. Vascular involvement and invasion of the mesoappendix are features that may favor a more radical approach.\r"

To explore the contractual obligations of primary care physicians in HMOs, I mailed a survey to all 595 HMOs known to be in operation as of June 1986. In all, 302 of 595 HMOs (51 percent) responded. Sixty-seven percent of plans with capitation-based arrangements and 82 percent of plans with fee-for-service arrangements withhold a percentage of their physicians' income against potential deficits, but only 21 percent of plans with salaried physicians do so. Thirty percent of HMOs have other penalties in addition to this withholding. Eighteen percent of HMOs base the return of the withheld amount on the experience of individual physicians rather than on the collective experience of a group of physicians. For-profit HMOs are less likely to use salary-based payment, more likely to withhold a percentage of income, and more likely to base the return of this withheld amount on the experience of individual physicians. Most HMOs have mechanisms for sharing surpluses with participating physicians. I conclude that contractual arrangements in HMOs vary widely. Certain financial incentives, especially when used in combination, suggest conflicts of interest that may influence physicians' behavior and adversely affect the quality of care.\r"

Brain binding sites have been identified for both the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 subtypes. Receptors of the 5-HT3 type have been characterized on isolated peripheral tissue models such as the rat vagus nerve, guinea-pig ileum and isolated rabbit heart. Using these models, selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as MDL 72222 (ref. 5), ICS 205-930 (ref. 6), GR38032F (ref. 7) and BRL 43694 (ref. 8) have been developed. Recently, GR38032F, MDL 72222 and ICS 205-930 have been shown to have behavioural effects in rodents and primates that undoubtedly reflect an action in the central nervous system (refs 9-11 and unpublished observations), suggesting the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in the brain. Here we report direct evidence for the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in rat brain tissue and their distribution, based on high affinity binding of the potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 3H-GR65630 to homogenates of rat entorhinal cortex. Selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and agonists inhibited binding of 3H-GR65630 with high affinities which correlated well with their actions on the rat isolated vagus nerve. Binding was differentially distributed throughout the brain with high concentrations in cortical and limbic areas.\r"

Such complex behaviour can be analysed using methods derived from chaos theory, which is concerned with the non-linear dynamics of deterministic systems that have irregular periodicities as well as an exquisite sensitivity to the initial conditions. We report here that the general response patterns of non-oscillatory cardiac conducting tissues, when driven rhythmically by repetitive stimuli from their surroundings, are similar to those of other deterministic systems showing chaotic dynamics. Such patterns include phase locking, period-doubling bifurcation and irregular activity. We have used electrophysiological techniques and analytical arguments to explain this unforeseen behaviour and to provide some key information about its mechanisms. The study of these dynamics is of general application to the understanding of disordered phenomena in excitable media, and may provide new insight about the origin of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Chloride impermeability of epithelial cells can account for many of the experimental and clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF). Activation of apical-membrane Cl- channels by cyclic AMP-mediated stimuli is defective in CF airway epithelial cells, despite normal agonist-induced increases in cellular cAMP levels. This defect in Cl- channel regulation has been localized to the apical membrane by exposing the cytoplasmic surface of excised membrane patches to the catalytic subunit (C subunit) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP. In membranes from normal cells, C-subunit activated Cl- channels with properties identical to those stimulated by cAMP-dependent agonists during cell-attached recording. Activation by the C subunit was not observed in CF membranes, but the presence of Cl- channels was verified by voltage-induced activation. The failure of the C subunit to activate the Cl- channels of CF membranes indicates that the block in their cAMP-mediated activation lies distal to induction of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and focuses our attention on the Cl- channel and its membrane-associated regulatory proteins as the probable site of the CF defect.\r"

It has been isolated from gonadal fluids and characterized as a protein heterodimer consisting of an alpha subunit and one of two beta subunits (beta A or beta B). FSH-releasing protein (FRP), also named activin, is a dimer consisting of two inhibin beta-chains. A factor from conditioned medium of a leukaemia cell line has been isolated which can induce mouse Friend cells to become benzidine-positive, and which shares a similar N-terminal sequence with porcine FRP. In this report, we find that FRP and inhibin modulate both the induction of haemoglobin accumulation in a human erythroleukaemic cell line, K562, and the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in human bone marrow culture. These two proteins could constitute a novel humoral regulatory control of erythropoiesis which would involve two types of related protein dimers with functionally opposite effects.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation damage to proteins is a topic of intense interest to those involved in radiation effects in biology, and also to those involved in radiotherapy. Although it has been widely studied, fundamental processes in protein damage are very hard to specify because of the complexity of the final damage products. But the non-invasive technique of electron-spin resonance is ideally suited to the task of detecting and identifying the primary and secondary products as these are expected to contains unpaired electrons (that is, free-radicals) and such species are uniquely detected by this sensitive form of spectroscopy. Our present study shows that a major radical species formed by electron loss in a range of proteins is the backbone amido radical, -N.(CO)-, characterized by hyperfine coupling to one 14N nucleus. These centres are efficiently trapped in proteins at low temperatures. In contrast, the expected backbone electron-capture centres, -NH(CO.-)-, are not readily trapped and electron transfer occurs until the ejected electron is trapped by some electrophilic centre. Such electron mobility was in fact established in our previous work on oxyhaemoglobin (FeO2----FeO2-), superoxide dismutase (Cu(II)----Cu(I] haemocyanin (Cu(II)O2Cu(I)----Cu(I)O2Cu(II] and various proteins containing S-S bonds (-S-S-)----(-S.-S-) (refs 1-4 respectively). This is strongly supported by our observation that such electrons are captured by DNA molecules, giving T.- centres, when nucleohistones are irradiated, and that Fe(CN)3-(6) ions readily scavenge such electrons from proteins which are devoid of highly electrophilic centres.\r"

Our parallel studies on the development of both single- and double-strand breaks under comparable conditions provide good evidence that these radical centres are the precursors to such damage, and we and others have argued that this may be of relevance to the damage pathways in vivo. We now report evidence that when DNA is complexed to proteins as it is in the nuclei of eukaryotes, electron transfer from the histone to DNA is facile, leading to a significant increase in the yield of electron-gain centres in DNA as judged from their electron-spin resonance spectra. In contrast 'holes' generated in the protein are trapped and do not lead to any detectable increase in the yields of G.+.\r"

The patients were 10 to 70 years old (median, 48 years). Thirty-five patients (64%) had glioblastoma multiforme, and 20 (36%) had anaplastic astrocytoma. The median interval between the first operation and reoperation was 43 weeks. The Karnofsky rating before reoperation ranged from 40 to 90 (median, 70). Eleven patients (20%) had more than one reoperation. The mortality rate was 1.4% per procedure, and the morbidity rate was 16% per procedure. After reoperation, 41 patients (75%) had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The median survival for all patients was 92 weeks. The median survival after reoperation was 36 weeks. Patients with Karnofsky ratings of greater than or equal to 70, with anaplastic astrocytomas, or in whom gross total removal of the tumor was undertaken lived longer than their respective counterparts (P less than 0.05). Prereoperation Karnofsky rating and extent of surgical resection were the most important independent factors related to survival after reoperation according to multivariate analysis (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). Twenty-five patients (45%) had improved Karnofsky ratings after reoperation, and the 32 patients (58%) who were independent after reoperation were able to stay so for more than 6 months of their survival time (median value). Reoperation is feasible and can be accomplished with acceptable mortality and morbidity. When intracranial malignant gliomas recur, the combined use of reoperation and adjuvant therapy prolongs good quality life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The advisability of a second operation for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma depends on the expected duration and quality of subsequent survival. We reviewed the results in 70 consecutive patients who underwent reoperation for supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (n = 39) or anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 31) between 1975 and 1984. The operative morbidity rate was 5.7% (4 of 70 patients); the 6-week postoperative mortality rate was 4.3% (3 of 70 patients). The median duration of survival after reoperation was 36 weeks in patients with glioblastoma multiforme and 88 weeks in those with anaplastic astrocytoma. The median duration of high quality survival (defined as the period during which the patient had a Karnofsky performance score of at least 70) after reoperation was 10 weeks for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and 83 weeks for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. Age and preoperative Karnofsky score in patients with glioblastoma multiforme and age in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma had statistically significant effects on the duration of high quality survival after reoperation, but not on postoperative survival independent of quality. Although age and functional status do not significantly affect the duration of survival after reoperation, they do have a significant effect on the quality of life after reoperation. Frequently, a patient can expect to spend a greater portion of his life at a higher level of function than he would have without reoperation. As adjunctive forms of therapy improve, reoperation will play an increasingly prominent role in the management of recurrent malignant astrocytic tumors.\r"

Forty-three patients were followed for at least two sequential intellectual assessments and provide the data for this study. Children with hemispheric tumors had the most general cognitive impairment. The degree of tumor resection, adequately treated hydrocephalus, and chemotherapy had no bearing on intellectual outcome. Age of the child affected outcome mainly as it related to radiation. Whole brain radiation therapy was associated with cognitive decline.

Different rates of ventricular enlargement were obtained in two groups of cats by opening either the calvaria or the calvaria and the dura mater before injecting kaolin into the cisterna magna. Animals from each group underwent in vivo fixation of brain 2, 3, and 6 weeks after hydrocephalus was induced. Specimens of white matter were taken 1, 2, and 3 mm lateral to the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricles, imbedded, and examined using transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructural changes associated with ventricular enlargement varied with the model used and the duration of hydrocephalus. Marked expansion of the extracellular space extending 2 mm lateral from the ependyma was found in the craniectomy-durectomy preparations examined 2 to 3 weeks after kaolin injection. Time-matched craniectomy preparations had less enlargement of the extracellular space that was confined to the white matter immediately adjacent to the ventricle. Marked glial reaction was observed in these areas in the early craniectomy preparations. When studied 6 weeks after hydrocephalus induction, both models had less expansion of the extracellular spaces compared to early observations. Glial reaction was found in both models, but was greater in the craniectomy model. The correlation of these morphological findings with the rate of ventricular enlargement and earlier studies of water content are discussed.\r"

The mean duration between SAH and clipping of the ruptured aneurysm was 4.6 days (range, 1-16 days), and 59% had operations on or before Day 3 post-SAH. Of the 37 patients with good neurological outcome, 26 patients had good neuropsychological outcome (no more than mild deficit). Poor neuropsychological outcome was associated with age and anterior communicating artery aneurysms.

Studies were carried out in seven normotensive dogs and seven dogs in which experimental renal hypertension of 3 months duration had been induced. In the normotensive animals, the collagen content of the middle cerebral artery exceeded that of the other vessels considered. The elastin content and the total connective tissue were not significantly affected by arterial site. The middle cerebral artery collagen to elastin ratio was greater than corresponding values for the basilar, posterior cerebral, and internal carotid arteries. Connective tissue differences were less pronounced in the hypertensive animals. No component of the canine circle of Willis in the hypertensive dogs showed a significantly different collagen content, elastin content, total connective tissue content, or collagen to elastin ratio. In comparing cerebral vessels from normotensive and hypertensive dogs, total connective tissue values were greater in hypertension for all arterial sites considered. These acute physiological changes in connective tissue content over small distances in intracranial blood vessels from normotensive animals, together with unique connective tissue responses of these vessels to short term hypertension, may suggest additional possible factors important in the natural history of cerebrovascular pathological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We report the long term results of the treatment of 23 intracranial ruptured aneurysms by coating. Twenty-three patients treated by coating were followed for a mean period of 11.2 years. The mean interval between the last hemorrhage and the operation was 22.4 days. Ten aneurysms underwent total coating, 9 with Biobond and 1 with Aron Alpha. Thirteen aneurysms underwent partial coating, 11 with Biobond and 2 with Aron Alpha. Six aneurysms were reinforced partially by other materials, but no aneurysm was wrapped totally with these materials. Rebleeding occurred in 6 patients, of whom 5 died. The mean interval between coating and rebleeding was 4 years. All patients suffering rebleeding had been treated with Biobond, and 3 patients had undergone total coating of aneurysms. The risk of recurrent hemorrhage after total coating with Biobond was 33%. One rebleeding patient underwent a second operation 10.5 years after total coating of the aneurysm. Biobond was found only at the tip of the aneurysmal sac. From these results, reinforcement of ruptured aneurysms with Biobond seems to be of little value, and a more reliable method must be developed for aneurysms that cannot be clipped.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated 95 hospitalized patients (50 women and 45 men) aged 15 to 45 who had nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Aneurysmal SAH was identified in 75 patients. Other causes for SAH were ruptured arteriovenous malformations (2 cases), amphetamine arteritis (1 case), and leptomeningeal melanoma (1 case). The cause of SAH was undetermined in 16 (17%) patients. Thirteen patients had histories of hypertension, 5 used oral contraceptives, and 4 had consumed large quantities of alcohol during the day before SAH. Only 1 patient had Type I diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis was delayed in 21 patients. Operation was performed in 71 patients, with only 3 (4.2%) deaths. The overall mortality was 8.4% (8 of 95), with all deaths due to neurological causes. Our data suggest that the overall management and surgical results of treatment of ruptured aneurysms in young adults are excellent, diabetes is rare among young adults with SAH, recent alcohol consumption does not seem to be a major factor predisposing to SAH in young adults, and misinterpretation of the early symptoms of SAH continues to be a serious problem.\r"

Aortic occlusion was associated with disappearance of the SEPs in seven of nine sheep in 7.8 +/- 4.1 (SD) minutes. SCBF at the time of initial cross clamping and 30 minutes after the onset of ischemia revealed a severe reduction in white and gray matter flow in the thoracolumbar cord. Release of the aortic clamp was associated with reactive hyperemia in these ischemic regions. In two animals, the SEP persisted during aortic cross clamping. The total SCBF in the thoracic and lumbar regions of these two animals exceeded 20 ml/100 g/min after 30 minutes of ischemia and was significantly greater than the flow recorded in sheep whose evoked response disappeared. The relation between spinal cord ischemia and evoked potential alterations is discussed in detail.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal metastases are present in up to 10% of all cancer patients at some time during the course of their disease. Pain is the most common presenting symptom, and neurological function is usually normal at this early stage. The clinical challenge is to detect and treat the spinal disease before the onset of neurological compromise. Myelography has been the standard test for identification of epidural metastases, but the invasive nature of myelography carries inherent risk and produces patient discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in the evaluation of other spinal diseases, is noninvasive, and is tolerated well by patients. We evaluated and compared MRI (64 studies in 58 patients) to conventional studies (myelography, computed tomography, bone scanning, plain films) and determined its accuracy in diagnosis and efficacy in clinical decision making. MRI proved superior in detecting bone and epidural involvement by tumor and was valuable in clinical decision making. In addition, MRI provided better visualization of paravertebral soft tissue involvement by tumor. MRI is recommended as the initial study in patients with suspected metastatic spinal disease.\r"

These resulting coupled motions were measured in isolated cervical motion segments using three-dimensional videophotogrammetry with a coordinate system fixed in space. A cross coupling algorithm provided error correction and conversion from local to true cartesian coordinates. The data were analyzed by computer, and the true coupled motions resulting from any applied force were obtained. A second group of specimens was facetectomized, and the experiments were repeated. After facetectomy, a moment about the anteroposterior axis resulted in marked reduction in lateral displacement, decrease in vertical displacement, and decrease in rotation about the vertical axis. Results were significant at P less than 0.01 and represent a significant decrease in coupled motions resulting from lateral bending. At P less than 0.05, a laterally applied force causes less lateral displacement and lateral flexion, but more longitudinal displacement. Flexion and extension movements are not significantly altered after facetectomy.\r"

Carter et al. found that the thermal diffusion technique using a Peltier stack as the probe produced extremely stable recordings and was suitable for quantitative work. We made a more stable probe containing an air space and having a stainless cap that added weight. A stable recording of blood flow was then possible. For calibration of the probe, we used blood flow values measured by means of an electrolytic technique and the equation proposed by Carter et al. In the present study, we have shown that it is theoretically possible to perform the calibration even without obtaining data on blood flow after cardiac arrest. Experimentally, the validity of such calibration was confirmed. This technique for measuring blood flow should be applicable in various fields and its use in a clinical setting, particularly in the monitoring of blood flow during neurosurgical operations, can be expected.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (31P MR) spectroscopy was used to obtain serial in vivo measurements of cerebral adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH levels in rats during temporary global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Three groups of 4 rats each that recovered from permanent bilateral vertebral artery occlusion were placed in a MR spectrometer and subjected to remotely controlled bilateral carotid artery occlusion lasting 6, 15, or 30 minutes followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Four additional rats that developed systemic hypotension (2 during a 6-minute occlusion and 2 during a 15-minute occlusion) were also studied. 31P MR spectra were obtained in each rat before, during, and after ischemia. Rats in which MR spectra showed metabolic recovery underwent a second occlusion followed by reperfusion and sacrifice. In the 12 normotensive rats, metabolic alterations began within 3 minutes after the onset of global ischemia. By the end of the occlusion period, cerebral ATP had decreased by 20 to 100% in 10 rats and PCr had decreased by 15 to 75% in all 12; Pi increased by 25 to 240%. The mean intracellular pH decreased from 7.33 to 6.9 +/- 0.6. The degree of metabolic deterioration during ischemia was not related to the duration of occlusion. During reperfusion, ATP, PCr, Pi, and intracellular pH returned to normal in 4 rats; 5 rats had partial metabolic recovery, and 3 had minimal or transient metabolic recovery followed by progressive deterioration. All rats that developed systemic hypotension had a decrease in ATP, PCr, and intracellular pH and an increase in Pi during the initial occlusion. Each had transient partial recovery in ATP during reperfusion, and 2 had slight recovery of PCr. The onset of hypotension was followed by depletion of these metabolites, progressive increase in Pi, and progressive intracellular acidosis. All rats that deteriorated metabolically after reversal of carotid occlusion died by the end of the reperfusion period or soon after. The 8 rats that recovered from the first occlusion were subjected to a second period of ischemia, during which each rat showed severe depletion of metabolites. During the second reperfusion, only 1 rat showed significant metabolic recovery, which lasted only 30 minutes and was followed by progressive deterioration. Severe global cerebral ischemia was associated with a progressive decline in both ATP and PCr, whereas less complete ischemia seemed to be characterized by stabilization or recovery of ATP and continued depression of PCr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Flash-evoked visual potentials (VEPs) recorded from the scalp were used in a series of 35 patients with tumors along the visual pathway: 3 orbital tumors, 25 perisellar tumors, 4 intraventricular tumors, and 3 occipital lesions. Preoperatively, various combinations of impaired visual fields and visual acuity were observed in over 90% of the patients. A postoperative decrease in visual function was observed in 3 cases. Of the 25 perisellar lesions, 13 were operated through a standard frontotemporal craniotomy and 12 were operated through a transnasal-transsphenoidal approach. VEPs were highly susceptible to volatile anesthetics, and there was a significant incidence of spontaneous latency increases and amplitude decreases in a large number of patients. There was an unacceptably high number of cases with significant VEP alteration occurring without concomitant visual function change. During trepanation or the transnasal approach, a reversible potential loss was observed in 11 patients, a profoundly altered wave form was seen in 8 cases, and a loss of single peaks was observed in 15 patients. During dissection of the tumor, a reversible potential loss or a potential with unidentifiable peaks was found in 25 cases; however, the VEPs recovered during closure or in the recovery room. There was no correlation between intraoperative VEP changes and the postoperative changes in visual function. In only 1 patient with an insignificant postoperative decrease in visual acuity from 0.4 to 0.3 was there a concomitant intraoperative potential loss. The major conclusion of our findings is that light-emitting diode flash-evoked VEPs demonstrate intraoperative changes that appear too early and too prominently to be caused solely by manipulation of the optic pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based on preoperative surgical intervention, eyelids were divided into four groups: levator resection, levator aponeurosis advancement, surgery associated with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, and miscellaneous reconstructive eyelid procedures. For each group the mean preoperative and postoperative eyelid levels, the mean change in eyelid level following surgery, and the mean amount of surgery performed were analyzed statistically with the two-tailed student's t-test. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the change in eyelid level and the amount of levator recession performed. No significant relationship was demonstrated between eyelid retraction and dysthyroid ophthalmopathy or reconstructive eyelid surgery. However, a significant relationship was demonstrated between the amount of recession and the eyelid level change for eyelids retracted following levator resection (P less than .01) and levator aponeurosis surgery (P less than .05). This may indicate that the change in eyelid level following a simplified LPS recession in these two groups is predictable. However, additional prospective studies are required to further assess the clinical applicability and use of this finding.\r"

This eye care plan and delivery scheme for developing nations attempts to integrate three essential disciplines of blindness prevention (epidemiology, administration, and education) with six major causes of blindness (cataract, trachoma, glaucoma, xerophthalmia, onchocerciasis, and leprosy) at three levels of intervention (community, primary, and secondary). The result can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional geometric model. This spatial construct has many practical applications and should serve as a useful frame of reference for eye care professionals and organizations active in international ophthalmology and blindness prevention in developing countries.\r"

However, there are many objections to this hypothesis. Deducing from electron microscopy of the epithelial cells, which shows vesicles in the superficial layer and glycocalix threads on the microvilli and other clinical facts, we think that the surfacing agent is not mucus but glycocalix. The disappearance of goblet cells during sicca syndrome is not the cause but the result of the dryness. Epithelial cell integrity is essential for the stability of the tear film and therapeutics must aim at regenerating these cells rather than only replacing the lacrimal film by tear substitute.\r"

When the dose was increased to 3,000 rad and radiation treatment was started 1 day after implantation, proliferation and traction detachment were observed in only 10% of eyes (2 of 20). No acute damage to retinal tissue or nerve fibers was observed. Because it is easily available, simple in application and dose adjustment, and without toxic side effects, radiation therapy should be considered as an effective alternative to drug treatment for the inhibition of intraocular proliferation and detachment.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in lightly pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, the spinal neurotransmitter(s) mediating descending inhibition of the nociceptive tail-flick (TF) reflex produced by focal electrical stimulation in the PAG or NRM. To characterize the neurotransmitter(s) mediating inhibition of the TF reflex, selective pharmacologic antagonists were administered into the lumbar intrathecal space. Stimulation thresholds in the PAG or NRM for inhibition of the TF reflex were established and the effects of intrathecally administered phentolamine, yohimbine, prazosin, methysergide (15 micrograms initially, 30 micrograms cumulative) or naloxone (10 micrograms initially, 20 micrograms cumulative) on TF inhibitory thresholds determined. Phentolamine, yohimbine and methysergide increased the intensity of stimulation in the PAG and the NRM for inhibition of the TF reflex; prazosin and naloxone had no effect. Descending inhibition produced by focal electrical stimulation in the PAG or NRM is mediated in part by spinal serotonergic and/or alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Naloxone was administered both intrathecally and intravenously; however, a role for opioid receptors in descending inhibition from the midbrain or medulla was not found.\r"

  ".W": "We present a case report of a patient with the typical sensory features of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN). The pain was elicited by innocuous stimuli, summated with repeated stimulation, radiated outside the stimulus zone, referred to a distant site, persisted beyond the period of stimulation, and exhibited a variable refractory period. Unusual sensory features included multiple trigger zones that changed over time and involved all 3 trigeminal divisions. Our sensory evaluation indicated that the pain was evoked by repetitive activation of rapidly adapting, A beta, low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents. However, activation of such mechanoreceptive afferents alone never produces pain in normal situations and often leads to a suppression of pain responsivity. The findings support the idea that the mechanism of pain in ITN involves pathophysiological mechanisms in the central nervous system. Our hypothesis is that structural and functional changes in the trigeminal system result in an alteration in the receptive field organization of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neurons. There appears to be an alteration in the surround inhibition mechanism of these neurons leading to an expansion of their touch receptive fields. This results in touch stimuli producing activity in WDR neurons that mimics the activity produced under normal conditions by noxious stimuli. Since WDR neurons participate in the encoding of the perceived intensity of noxious stimuli, a series of punctate tactile stimuli are now perceived as localized, pin-prick or electric shock-like sensations. Similar pathophysiological mechanisms may explain, in part, the pain of peripheral neuropathies associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetes and causalgia.\r"

Two internally reliable scales, Active Coping and Passive Coping, were derived using factor analytic techniques from a sample of 361 rheumatoid arthritis patients. The 2 scales showed an opposite pattern of relationships with criterion measures. While Active Coping was associated with reports of less pain, less depression, less functional impairment, and higher general self-efficacy, Passive Coping was correlated with reports of greater depression, greater pain and flare-up activity, greater functional impairment, and lower general self-efficacy. The relationship of these scales to previous theory and research on coping is presented. These scales appear useful for the assessment of coping strategies in clinical settings and in treatment outcome research on chronic pain.\r"

Furthermore, chronic pain behavior seems to be composed of at least 9 components: anxiety, attention seeking, verbal pain complaints, medication use, general verbal complaints, distorted posture and mobility, fatigue, insomnia, and depressive mood. More dimensions and components were discovered than in the study by Turk and his colleagues. However, they correspond with the variety of psychosocial problems associated with the chronic pain syndrome. This information seems to provide a useful basis for the development of an observational measurement technique for chronic pain.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, several authors have questioned the reliability and validity of relying on retrospective assessment of labor pain. Many studies designed to determine the relationships between psychosocial and demographic factors and pain intensity during labor have relied on such measurements. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine if primiparas and multiparas can accurately remember the pain of labor. Fifty primiparas and 88 multiparas participated in the study. Prospective assessment of in-labor pain was performed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in 3 phases of labor. Retrospective assessment of labor pain was performed 2 days post partum using the VAS. Results showed that there were significant differences between the amount of actual pain reported and the amount of pain and discomfort remembered by both primiparas and multiparas. The mean rating for remembered discomfort was higher than for remembered pain. The subjects tended to deflate the intensity of their labor pain. The results suggest that previous studies that have relied on retrospective assessments of labor pain may be invalid.\r"

Twelve patients with pain secondary to cancer were simultaneously administered both morphine (10 mg) and pethidine (50 mg) in 10 ml of normal saline via an epidural catheter inserted in the lumbar region (usually L2,3) and attached to a subcutaneously implanted portal reservoir. Frequent blood samples were collected to characterise the vascular uptake of both opioids. In addition, a single CSF sample was collected in each patient from the C7-T1 interspace at one of the following times: 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min. There was a rapid vascular uptake of morphine from the epidural space with a mean (+/- S.D.) peak concentration of 173 +/- 80 ng/ml (range 52-345 ng/ml) and a time-to-peak concentration of 8 +/- 6 min (range 2-17 min). In contrast, the vascular uptake of pethidine was more variable with a mean (+/- S.D.) concentration of 274 +/- 294 ng/ml (range 80-1113 ng/ml) and the time-to-peak concentration was 21 +/- 26 min (range 2-75 min). There was a rapid absorption of pethidine across the dura mater into the CSF with peak CSF concentrations between 1400 and 1650 ng/ml occurring between 10 and 60 min in samples collected cephalad (C7-T1 interspace) from the administration point in the lumbar region. However, the peak morphine concentration in CSF was delayed relative to the pethidine peak and occurred at 120 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients with recurrent low back pain display a different pattern of mood fluctuations across days than matched healthy controls and whether these mood states are related to pain occurrence and/or magnitude using a prospective design. The questions addressed are whether mood states prior to a pain episode are associated with the episode or whether mood relates to pain as a secondary reaction. Similarly, the relationship between mood state recorded prior to, during or following pain and magnitude of pain experienced was investigated. Thirty-three ambulatory chronic low back pain patients and an equivalent group of asymptomatic controls matched for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and reported activity level monitored mood state (anxiety, tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) and pain before breakfast, at 4 p.m. and at bedtime for 14 consecutive days. Groups were successfully matched. Analyses revealed significantly higher levels of tension, anxiety and fatigue and lower levels of vigor in the pain cases. No mood state was predictive of pain onset but fatigue was associated with pain 24 h following pain, indicating fatigue as secondary to pain. While mood state recorded prior to or following pain was unable to predict magnitude of pain, fatigue was associated with the level of pain experienced during the pain episode itself. The findings reveal a pattern of anxiety, tension and fatigue where fatigue is associated with increased pain during the pain episode and is increased 24 h following pain. This fatigue-pain relationship is superimposed upon a continuous elevation of anxiety and tension. These findings suggest the importance of pain management efforts directed at decreasing patients' fatigue levels, and increasing functional endurance while simultaneously reducing anxiety. The results also question the role of negative mood states in the initiation or exacerbation of pain and highlights the influence of physical mood states such as fatigue on pain in low back pain.\r"

  ".U": "88095990\r", 
  ".W": "Recordings were made from dorsal horn neurones in the spinal cord and trigeminal nucleus caudalis of intact anaesthetized rats. These rats had been rendered polyarthritic by s.c. injection of Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in oil into the base of the tail. The experiments were carried out during the acute phase of the illness (3-4 weeks post inoculation) during which hyperalgesia occurred. The disease mainly affected the hind paws and the tail and, to a lesser extent, the forepaws. The facial area of the animals was not at all affected. As described in a previous paper, recordings from lumbar dorsal horn neurones revealed that two subpopulations could be described on the basis of their electrophysiological characteristics. Namely, 'typical' units which include convergent, non-noxious and proprioceptive neurones and which have properties essentially similar to those found in healthy rats, and 'atypical' cells which have no counterpart in healthy rats and which include convergent and non-noxious neurones. All the typical convergent neurones were inhibited by noxious stimuli applied to heterotopic body areas, whereas typical non-noxious and proprioceptive neurones were not; these observations are similar to those described in healthy rats as diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC). However, it was also found that 88% of the atypical convergent and 85% of the atypical non-noxious cells were inhibited by various heterotopic stimuli. The most important observation was that gentle stimulation such as mild pressure applied to the inflamed contralateral ankle joint--a stimulus intensity which has never been found to be effective in healthy animals--was capable of triggering inhibition of both typical and atypical convergent neurones. Recordings from trigeminal nucleus caudalis neurones revealed that the entire population presented essentially the same properties as those observed in healthy animals in terms of activity evoked by natural or electrical stimulation of their excitatory receptive fields. The activity of non-noxious neurones was never modified by any heterotopically applied stimuli. By contrast, all convergent neurones were inhibited by heterotopic stimuli, noxious (52 degrees C, pinch) or non-noxious (light and mild pressure), applied to inflamed areas. While the inhibition triggered by noxious stimuli was reminiscent of that observed in healthy rats, the inhibition triggered by non-noxious mechanical stimuli was related to the inflammatory state of the part of the body stimulated, the most sensitive areas being the hind paws.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Single neuronal responses to noxious skin heating were recorded extracellulary in the lumbar dorsal horn and found to be depressed by pentobarbital at subanesthetic doses (4.0, 8.0, 17.0 and 24.5 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg, depression by pentobarbital was positively correlated with the depth of the recording site in the spinal cord (laminae IV-VI), i.e., neurons in deeper laminae (V-VI) were attenuated, while neurons in lamina IV were unaffected. At all doses tested, pentobarbital failed to affect stimulation-produced descending inhibition from either the midbrain periaqueductal gray or the medullary nucleus raphe magnus. The present data furnish evidence for the antinociceptive potency of pentobarbital, they do not support the view that a 'partial pharmacological spinal cord transection' would attenuate stimulation-produced descending inhibition of nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the antinociceptive effect of metapramine (META) in 4 nociception tests: (1) the hot plate test; (2) the phenylbenzoquinone-induced writhing; (3) the tail flick test; and (4) the test of electrical stimulation of the tail. We further analysed, using META and clomipramine (CLOM), the eventual role of endogenous opioids in analgesia induced by TCAs. The analgesic effects of META and CLOM in the hot plate test and in the test of electrical stimulation of the tail were reversed by naloxone. On the other hand, we failed to demonstrate a potentiation of META- or CLOM-induced analgesia by acetorphan, an inhibitor of 'enkephalinase.' We also failed to show a potentiation of Met5-enkephalin intracerebroventricularly injected by the two TCAs. Moreover, the administration of the enzymatic inhibitor or of Met5-enkephalin led to a slight decrease of the analgesic effect of the TCAs. These results (1) indicate that in our 4 pain tests, META clearly reduces nociception and (2) provide evidence that the involvement of endogenous enkephalins in the analgesia induced by TCAs is improbable.\r"

The analgesia was always accompanied by a rise in mean arterial blood pressure but the time course of the cardiovascular and antinociceptive changes was different. Guanethidine (7 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the pressor response but had no effect on the magnitude or time course of the analgesia. In contrast, microinjection of physostigmine into PGL produced a pressor response but no change in the latency of the tail flick response. It is concluded that there are functionally distinct pools of neurones within PGL which respectively produce antinociception and changes in vasomotor activity. Ongoing activity in both types of neurone is regulated by a tonic inhibitory GABAergic influence. In addition, the cardiovascular neurones receive a tonic excitatory cholinergic input.\r"

During a 1- to 3-year follow-up, most patients developed new symptomatic lesions. The disease was unaffected by antimicrobial therapy. Two of our patients had psoriasis and all were rheumatoid factor-, antinuclear factor- and HLA-B27-negative. We speculate that chronic recurrent osteomyelitis is a noninfectious inflammatory condition, a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Chronic recurrent osteomyelitis is a clinical entity that should be recognized so that invasive diagnostic procedures and antimicrobial therapy are appropriately used.

Of 109 infants evaluated 54 were afebrile and 55 had fever (rectal temperature, greater than 38 degrees C). Serious bacterial infection occurred in 8 (14.5%) infants with documented fever and in none of those who were afebrile at the time of presentation (P = 0.003). An initial complete blood count profile of the two groups showed that nearly all (96%) in the afebrile group had a complete blood count differential ratio [% of lymphocytes + % of monocytes)/(% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes + % band forms] of greater than 1, whereas the majority (87.5%) of febrile infants with serious infection had a differential ratio of less than 1. The neonate with a history of fever who is afebrile upon presentation should receive a complete evaluation for possible bacterial infection. The neonate who appears well, has no focal source of infection on examination and whose laboratory data do not reveal any abnormality represents a low risk for serious bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the extent to which Legionella pneumophila antibodies are passively transferred transplacentally into the fetal circulation, 199 matched serums of mothers and their newborn infants were tested using the indirect fluorescent polyclonal antibody technique. Considering L. pneumophila antibody titers of greater than or equal to 1:64 as evidence of inapparent infection, the overall prevalence rate was 35.7% for the mothers and 14.1% for their newborns. Among the mothers who were seropositive at greater than or equal to 1:64, 36.6% of their matched infants acquired antibodies transplacentally. With only two exceptions there were no newborns with an antibody titer greater than or equal to 1:64 whose mothers did not also evidence at least the same titer.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the delay in detectability of Chlamydia trachomatis infections acquired at birth, we serially evaluated 120 infants born vaginally to infected women. Specimens for isolation of Chlamydia were taken from several anatomic sites. Results were analyzed for the age and site of the initial positive culture from each infant. Of 112 infants tested in the first month of life, 22% were culture-positive in the conjunctiva and 25% were positive in the pharynx. Initial positive rectal and vaginal cultures were obtained only in the third and fourth months of life, and all initial vaginal cultures were associated with positive rectal cultures. The latency of C. trachomatis in infants exposed at birth is often more than 1 month and can be longer than 97 days. This latency might be caused by suppression of the growth of the organism by antibodies acquired in utero.\r"
