The contractile response of human prostate adenomas to selective alpha-1, alpha-2, and MCh agonists indicated that smooth muscle contraction of the human prostate is mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors. The selective affinities of terazosin for alpha-1 and alpha-2 binding sites were determined using competitive displacement assays.

  ".W": "Although the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are usually attributed to simple mechanical obstruction of the prostatic urethra by an enlarged prostate gland, the pathophysiology of this common urologic disorder actually involves multiple factors. These include abnormalities of detrusor function, neuromuscular abnormalities of the prostatic urethra, and sensory abnormalities of the bladder wall. Detrusor abnormalities include impaired detrusor contractility and involuntary detrusor contractions (detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia). Neuromuscular abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are characterized by alpha-adrenergic overactivity which causes outlet obstruction or by alpha-adrenergic hypoactivity which may result in urinary incontinence. Sensory abnormalities of the bladder wall include hypersensitivity (sensory urgency) or hyposensitivity which can lead to overdistention and urinary retention. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with clinical prostatism must take these factors into account. Of particular importance is the recognition that a decreased urinary flow rate and/or increased postvoid residual urine volume may be caused by either bladder outlet obstruction or impaired detrusor contractility. Routine urodynamic studies do not permit a distinction between these two entities, but video/detrusor pressure/uroflow studies are usually definitive.\r"

Six thromboembolic complications in patients without a malignant disease occurred at SPA levels greater than or equal to 28%, confirming that the limit of the therapeutic range, determined by the risk of thromboembolic recurrences, should be set at an SPA level of 25% (international normalized ratio, INR = 2.0), at least in venous disease. Major haemorrhages occurred mainly at SPA levels less than 10% (INR greater than 4.0), unless underlying risk factors were present, thus setting the other limit of the therapeutic range. However, an adjustment of this limit to SPA = 15% (INR approximately 3.0) is suggested, since it would lead to further reduction of haemorrhage and is advisable in most patients with venous thromboembolism.\r"

  ".W": "The ultimate aim in treating hypertension and hyperlipidemia is to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially strokes and coronary events, for example, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death. Extensive intervention studies in moderate-to-severe hypertension have revealed the significance of antihypertensive therapy in reducing total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, particularly from cerebrovascular causes. However, the reduction of coronary events has not been equally successful. The situation in mild-to-moderate hypertension is even more disappointing: recent studies, such as the Medical Research Council hypertension trial, the international Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, and the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertensives trial could not demonstrate any benefit from antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers or diuretics in the prevention of coronary heart disease. The reasons for these negative results are not obvious. However, metabolic side effects associated with certain antihypertensive drugs, which counteract the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction, are one topic of discussion. For the genesis of atherosclerosis of the coronary vasculature, hyperlipoproteinemia appears to be of greater importance than hypertension and has to be treated simultaneously. Two extensive intervention studies, the Lipid Research Clinics coronary primary prevention trial and the Helsinki Heart Study, showed a significant reduction of coronary events with lipid-lowering treatments with cholestyramine and gemfibrozil, respectively. These findings are in agreement with the results of a recent secondary prevention study, which showed a regression of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries and aortocoronary bypass grafts. Moreover, antihypertensive treatment aimed at a reduction in coronary heart disease has to focus on serum lipids, especially in mild hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is good epidemiologic evidence that hypertension is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, primary intervention trials have failed to demonstrate that a reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients reduces morbidity and mortality from cardiac events. Since various antihypertensive drugs adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism, these drugs may increase associated coronary risk and offset the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure. This article reviews the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. They can be summarized as follows: thiazide-type diuretics cause a marked elevation of plasma triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and minor increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but have little effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The nonselective beta-blockers do not significantly affect total cholesterol and LDL, but increase total triglycerides and VLDL and decrease HDL. The changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins caused by cardioselective beta-blockers and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are qualitatively similar but less pronounced. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to have no significant effects on plasma lipids. alpha 1-Inhibitors reduce total triglycerides, total cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL and increase HDL. The possible mechanisms by which antihypertensive drugs affect cellular lipid metabolism (e.g., LDL receptor, lipid synthesis, lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesteryl acyltransferase, acylcholesteryl acyltransferase, and cholesteryl ester hydrolase) are described. The clinical significance of changes in blood lipids and cellular lipid metabolism caused by antihypertensive drugs is not yet totally clear. Nevertheless, before antihypertensive drug treatment is initiated, blood lipid levels should be measured to identify preexisting hyperlipidemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89074532\r", 
  ".W": "In hypertension the primary pathophysiologic abnormality is a generalized increase in the peripheral vascular resistance as a result of concentric narrowing of the systemic arterioles, as a result of alpha 1-receptor stimulation. Such stimulation is attenuated by the selective alpha 1-inhibitor doxazosin. The pharmacologic attributes of doxazosin are translated into direct relaxation of the peripheral arteriolar resistance vessels and venous capacitance system, particularly those with a high alpha-adrenoceptor population. The direct effects of such vascular dilatation are immediately beneficial to the heart in reducing systemic and pulmonary vascular pressures that reduce left ventricular wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. In clinical studies doxazosin has been found to have a plasma half-life of 19 to 22 hours, of which a single daily dose is sufficient to control hypertension. The antiatherogenic changes in the blood lipid profile resulting from long-term treatment with doxazosin can also be expected to advance its primary prevention potential in hypertensive patients, which is in marked contrast to the potentially disadvantageous changes in the blood lipid profile that follow treatment with beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics. The therapeutic efficacy of doxazosin has been confirmed, irrespective of hypertension severity, age and race of the patient, or the presence of renal impairment or diabetes mellitus. Its side-effect profile is not substantially different from that of placebo or other antihypertensive drug treatment. Given its unique actions regarding antihypertensive efficacy, together with favorable effects on blood lipids, doxazosin probably holds more promise for the prevention of precocious coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients than any other currently available antihypertensive agent.\r"

All patients were considered therapy successes (sitting diastolic blood pressure either less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg reduction) at a mean daily dose of 8.1 mg. Twenty-seven patients (82%) achieved good blood pressure control (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) at a mean dose of 6.7 mg once daily. By the final treatment visit, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressures in the sitting and supine positions were significantly reduced by 40/29 and 37/28 mm Hg from a mean baseline of 180/121 and 181/121 mm Hg to final visit values of 140/91 and 144/92 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients experienced one or more side effects that were mild or moderate and disappeared or were tolerated with continued therapy. During the study no abnormal laboratory test findings were identified by the investigators.

  ".W": "Antihypertensive treatment is known to reduce mortality in severe hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity in mild and moderately severe hypertension, for example, from stroke and left ventricular failure. However, treated hypertensive patients still have significantly higher mortality and morbidity than matched control subjects. In particular, risk of coronary heart disease is affected little by antihypertensive treatment. There may be several explanations for these less than optimal results. For example, blood pressure may not have been brought down to strictly normotensive levels or an antihypertensive agent, which adversely affects serum lipoproteins, may have been used, thereby offsetting the intended therapeutic effect. Doxazosin, a new selective alpha 1-inhibitor, offers both effective antihypertensive action and a favorable lipid effect. Both of these effects could have a positive impact on risk of coronary heart disease and therefore may prove to be more effective than previously used antihypertensive treatments.\r"

Each supraventricular tachycardia has unique characteristics and each patient, even when similar arrhythmias are present, remains a person with specific manifestations.

Knowledge acquired in recent years makes it possible to diagnose correctly the type of supraventricular tachycardia using quite simple means. The spectrum of clinical presentation and significance of supraventricular arrhythmias is broad, with a wide range of clinical significance. Decisions on when and how to treat must therefore be taken carefully and specifically for each individual patient.\r"

In institutions where the procedure is routinely performed, the rate of successful accessory pathway interruption now approaches 98%. Concomitant risk of complete heart block among patients with posteroseptal pathways has declined to less than 5%. Among patients with other organic heart disease, myocardial preservation techniques result in mortality rates within 1 to 2%; among those with significant cardiac abnormalities, the mortality rate is 4 to 6%. Two techniques are generally used to ablate an accessory pathway: the endocardial and the epicardial. The aim of both approaches is to identify the site of the accessory pathway and disarticulate the atrioventricular groove or expose and ablate the atrioventricular junction to interrupt accessory pathway conduction. Although each technique has its advantages, the choice of technique is far less important than the skill of the surgeon and clinical electrophysiologist performing the procedure. Newer surgical techniques include application of external epicardial shocks in the area of the accessory pathway and use of a cryosurgical probe in the sinus to ablate accessory pathways. Whereas our current thought is that surgery should be limited to those adults who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy, advances in atrial endocardial and epicardial mapping, as well as surgical techniques, may expand the role of surgery in the treatment of ectopic atrial tachycardia.\r"

  ".U": "89074562\r", 
  ".W": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia most often results from atrioventricular (AV) reentry using an accessory AV pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) or reentry within the region of the AV node. In AV reentry, using an accessory pathway, suppression of the tachycardia may be achieved by depressing either anterograde AV nodal conduction or retrograde accessory pathway conduction. Intracardiac recordings and programmed electrical stimulation have established that beta-adrenergic antagonists and calcium channel blockers principally affect AV nodal conduction (anterograde limb of the reentrant circuit), whereas class IA and IC agents principally affect the accessory AV pathway (retrograde limb). Pharmacologic therapy has been more effective when directed at the limb in which conduction is most marginal at the tachycardia rate (weak limb). In individual patients, intracardiac recordings and programmed electrical stimulation can be used to identify the weak limb, indicating the class of agents most likely to be effective. Specialized techniques allowing direct recording of accessory pathway activation suggest that limitations in accessory pathway conduction may be explained by anatomic impediments. Conduction is most limited at the atrial interface of the accessory pathway in some patients, whereas in others the ventricular interface may be the limiting factor. Class IA and IC agents appear to have the greatest effect at sites where conduction is most tenuous, i.e., at the anatomic impediments. Similar considerations apply to AV nodal reentry. Anterograde slow AV nodal pathway conduction is most often depressed by digitalis preparations, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and calcium channel blockers, whereas retrograde fast AV nodal pathway conduction is more often depressed by class IA and IC agents. Intracardiac recordings and programmed electrical stimulation can also be used in these patients to identify the weak limb and direct pharmacologic therapy. Direct catheter recordings of AV nodal conduction remain elusive, limiting knowledge of the different conduction properties of the anterograde and retrograde limbs and the site(s) of drug action. Studies in progress, comparing the retrograde AV nodal conduction time during tachycardia with that during ventricular pacing at the same rate, suggest that the His bundle may be incorporated in the reentrant circuit in some patients. It appears that verapamil more readily depresses retrograde fast pathway conduction in these patients than in those in whom the His bundle does not form part of the reentrant circuit, but the reasons for this are unknown.\r"

The sensitivity and predictive value of screening tests, the increment in improved outcomes from screening compared with population-wide changes in diet; the benefit, if any, to be derived from diet modification for those not identified by screening; and the reliability of the laboratories performing the test are some of the factors to be considered. We must bear in mind that many of the common disorders for which we will soon have tests at the gene or gene-product level result from the interaction of multiple factors, both environmental and genetic. Genetic screening will detect only a small proportion of all those destined to manifest a specific disorder, such as coronary artery disease or colon cancer. Dietary modification will also be only one of several interventions that will be efficacious for certain disorders. In some of these cases, genetic screening will prove to be an effective adjunct to general nutritional changes whereas in others it will have little utility and in still others it could play the predominant role in preventing or reducing the severity of the disorder. If we are to reduce the burden of disease most effectively, we cannot ignore factors in our environment and social structure that limit people's ability to control their own health.\r"

DNA sequence analysis of the DR-beta chain genes encoding the DR4 subtypes as well as DR1 has led to the observation that similar third hypervariable region sequences are found on rheumatoid arthritis-associated DR-beta chain alleles. The data indicate that third hypervariable region sequence polymorphisms strongly influence T cell recognition as well as risk for rheumatoid arthritis.

Comparison of the primary structure of 39 HLA-A,B,C molecules shows that variation is found at many positions in the extracellular domains (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3). Positions with high variability are concentrated in and around the peptide-binding groove formed by the alpha 1- and alpha 2-domains and defined by crystallographic analysis of HLA-A2. It is likely that the polymorphic differences serve to alter both the peptide-binding specificity and the interaction with T cell receptors. This in turn may result in differences in immune responsiveness, susceptibility, and resistance to disease, and in alloantigenicity.\r"

The fact that this sequence was found in DR1, DR4,Dw14, and DR4,Dw15 beta-1 genes lends support to the hypothesis that, in some cases, human leukocyte antigen and disease association may involve the association of discrete disease-related epitopes rather than entire human leukocyte antigen genes and that these epitopes are immunologically relevant in terms of T cell recognition. The association of these polymorphisms with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis would then support the hypothesis that binding and presentation of \"arthritogenic peptides\" by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules is one of the pathogenic events in developing rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Antibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB are strongly associated with the class II antigens DR2 and DR3 and the response is directed to epitopes on the particles that change in evolution. These responses are found frequently in normal persons in low titer but not in animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus. Contrariwise, the immune response to Sm and U1RNP is only weakly associated with class II antigens and the response is to epitopes conserved in evolution. These responses are not found in normal persons but are frequently found in animal models. The implications of these differences are explored.\r"

Although the development of spondylitis is unclear, it has been hypothesized that HLA-B27 may predispose to spondyloarthropathies via the phenomenon of molecular mimicry. A computer search for homologies between HLA-B27 and microbes revealed a sequence of six consecutive amino acids (glutamine-threonine-aspartic acid-arginine-glutamic acid-aspartic acid) shared by HLA-B27.1 (residues 72 to 77), and Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase (residues 188 to 193). Antibodies raised against a peptide derived from HLA-B27 containing this six-amino-acid sequence cross-reacted with the peptide derived from Klebsiella that contained these six amino acids, and vice-versa. These antibodies also reacted with articular tissues from HLA-B27-positive patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Sera from 53 percent of Reiter's patients and 27 percent of patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed binding to these same peptides. These results suggest that molecular mimicry may have a role in disease development.\r"

Detailed studies of the structure of the HLA-B27 molecular family are in progress in several laboratories. Mice expressing HLA-B27 and transmitting it to their offspring (transgenic mice) have been produced and are being studied for their response to bacteria that are known to trigger reactive arthritis in B27+ humans.

  ".W": "Over the past few decades, a solid body of evidence has been built up linking certain autoimmune diseases to the presence of specific major histocompatibility complex haplotypes. Major histocompatibility complex products are used by the immune system to distinguish non-self from self and are important in the recognition of foreign antigen by T cells. T cells play a number of roles in the initiation and control of the immune response, leading to the suggestion that T cells may be important in the genesis of these diseases. T cell recognition is mediated by a heterodimeric cell surface receptor, the T cell antigen receptor. A better understanding of the molecular biology of this receptor may shed some light on the cellular and molecular processes involved in the initiation and progression of these diseases.\r"

The morphologic definition of activation from the 1960s has been replaced by a cell biologic definition in the 1980s, but recent studies have suggested that these phenomena are two aspects of the same processes. Moreover, the initial distinction of endothelial cell activation, a beneficial reaction, from injury and dysfunction, a harmful sequence, has become more complex as clinical studies have revealed that activation can produce dysfunction, with or without injury. Most importantly, as our in vivo studies indicate, the concept of activation is a testable hypothesis, as modern immunochemical and molecular biologic techniques have been employed to bridge the gap between in vitro culture experiments and patient-based clinical research.\r"

Its presence on some activated lymphocytes in non-neoplastic lymphoid tissues has been used as evidence that such cells might represent the physiologic counterpart of RS cells. In this study expression of CD30 antigen in 117 nonhematopoietic tumors was investigated using monoclonal antibody Ber-H2. The antigen was regularly expressed in frozen section (strongly) and paraffin section (less strongly) by embryonal carcinomas (8 of 10 studied) and the embryonal elements of mixed germ cell tumors (4 of 4), but not in other types of germ cell tumors (0 of 11) or nonhematopoietic tumors (0 of 92). Normal adult, neonatal, and fetal testes were negative for CD30 antigen, as were other fetal tissues and placenta. Ki-1 antibody gives similar results in frozen section. These findings have implications for theories suggesting an origin of RS cells from activated lymphocytes. They are also important for determining the diagnostic significance of CD30 positivity in a tumor of unknown origin, and suggest possible new uses for CD30 antibodies in routine diagnostic immunohistology.\r"

A monoclonal (HK-102) and an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, each recognizing specific domains on the protein core of a basement membrane-derived HSPG, localized HSPGs to the amyloid fibrils present in neuritic plaques (NPs) and congophilic angiopathy (CA) in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, with weak to no immunostaining in neurofibrillary tangles from the same tissues. HSPGs were also demonstrated in \"primitive plaques,\" suggesting that their accumulation takes place during early stages of plaque development. Immunolocalization of HSPGs to subsets of astrocytes and neuronal cells, particularly those in close proximity to NPs and CA, suggested possible involvement of these two cell types in deposition of HS-PGs into the amyloidotic lesions. The current study not only identifies a new component (HSPGs) present in the amyloid deposits of NPs and CA but also suggests that astrocytes, neurons, or both may be involved in its deposition at these sites.\r"

  ".W": "The cell walls of gram-negative bacteria contain several biologically active components, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoprotein, and protein 1. The effects of these individual components and a synthetic analog of lipoprotein, TPP, on several activation parameters of glomerular mesangial cells (MC) were examined. Prostaglandin secretion, synthesis of the autogrowth factor, mesangial interleukin-1 (IL-1), and new synthesis of cellular proteins were assessed as markers of MC activation. All bacterial cell wall components evaluated were active in varying degrees as stimulants of prostaglandin secretion. In general, PGE was the predominant product. TPP and protein 1 also induced substantial secretion of thromboxane. Each cell-wall component was effective in stimulating mesangial IL-1 secretion. The activation of MC was associated with the enhanced synthesis of many cellular proteins in addition to IL-1. Stimulation by these bacterial components was dependent on the state of the mesangial cell cycle, because nonproliferating cells did not respond to these factors. Activation of MC by gram-negative bacterial cell wall components, with release of vasoactive prostaglandins and peptide mitogens, may be responsible for some of the glomerular hemodynamic alterations and cellular proliferative events associated with sepsis or chronic bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "A non-neoplastic T cell population associated with a murine monoclonal B cell malignancy, CH44, was analyzed. Immunofluorescence on cell suspensions and immunoperoxidase staining on tissue sections using monoclonal antibodies to the antigens Thy1.2, Ly-1, L3T4, and Lyt-2 confirmed the presence of both TH (Ly-1/L3T4+, Lyt-2-) and Tc/s (Ly-1/L3T4-, Lyt-2+) T cell subpopulations. The non-neoplastic T cells were present in both a 0.6 and 2.1 g CH44-bearing spleen. T cells, not normally in liver in significant numbers, were found in liver tissue when the CH44 tumor cells were present. These data implied an active proliferation of the T cell populations within tissues containing the malignant B cells. Supernatant from an in-vitro-adapted cell line of CH44 (CH44.LX) was tested for its ability to induce proliferation of normal murine splenocytes and thymocytes. As assayed by tritiated thymidine incorporation, both spleen and thymus cells proliferated in the presence of CH44.LX supernatant. Although supernatant from two of nine other B cell lines was able to stimulate the proliferation of spleen cells, only CH44.LX could induce proliferation of thymus cells. Supernatant from the seven other B cell lines and three hybridomas had no measurable effect on either splenocytes or thymocytes in this assay. It is hypothesized that the presence of a non-neoplastic proliferating T cell population associated with a neoplastic B cell lymphoma during in vivo passaging of the tumor is the result of effects derived from a secreted product of the malignant B cells. Whether the T cells have any effect on the growth of the malignant B cells is not known.\r"

Thirty-one lymph nodes were categorized in the stages of follicle hyperplasia (n = 18), follicle degeneration (n = 5), and total depletion (n = 8). The follicle dendritic cells in germinal centers showed the presence of core proteins and, to a lesser extent, gp41. The staining patterns, being similar to those of immunoglobulins, suggested that they occur in the form of immune complexes. In addition there were solitary cells expressing viral protein, in particular gp41, and mRNA. The number of mRNA-positive cells was very low: about five positive cells were observed in a tissue section with about ten (hyperplastic) follicles. HIV-1-mRNA-positive cells were observed both in follicles and interfollicular areas and showed no differences between various stages. The extent and intensity of distinct HIV-1 proteins and HIV-1-mRNA gene segments in follicles were significantly correlated, as was their presence in interfollicular areas. No significant correlation was found between the presence of HIV-1 components in follicles and in interfollicular areas. This indicates that processes involving HIV-1 components occur in a segregated manner in both lymph node compartments. The presence of HIV-1 components did not correspond to any clinical classification (CDC criteria), nor to other histochemical characteristics. An exception was the correlation between gp41-positive cells and CD1-positive interdigitating cells in the interfollicular areas.\r"

In the present study, cultured myeloid leukemia HL60 cells, directly sampled bone marrow cells, and peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to 1-5 microM monensin for 0.5-20 hours. The effects were evaluated using ultrastructural, cytochemical, and biochemical methods. In HL60 cells and marrow promyelocytes treated with monensin, progressive vacuolation of the trans then the cis Golgi was observed. These vacuoles lacked diaminobenzidine (DAB) reactive peroxidase, high iron diamine (HID) reactive sulfated glycoconjugates, and periodate-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (PA-TCH-SP) reactive vicinal glycol containing complex carbohydrates, but some cis Golgi elements retained osmium zinc iodide reactive reducing groups. The number of normal intensely stained HID reactive granules decreased and an incomplete granule that was DAB-positive/HID-negative, PA-TCH-SP-negative with flocculent matrix density increased in frequency as a function of time and concentration of monensin. Treatment of HL60 cells with monensin markedly reduced 35SO4 incorporation but myeloperoxidase labeling and activity per cell remained constant, although it shifted to lower density granule fractions consistent with the persistent DAB staining of endoplasmic reticulum and synthesis of a DAB-positive, HID-negative granule in intact HL60 cells. The Golgi complex of monensin-treated myelocytes and segmented neutrophils was also vacuolated. A subpopulation of preformed primary granules in promyelocytes, myelocytes, and segmented neutrophils appeared to increase in size and peripheral or central electron lucency. These selective effects of monensin indicate that granule components may be packaged into DAB-positive organelles that are deficient in trans Golgi-derived elements (HID- and PA-TCH-SP-negative) and that some preformed primary granules contain a monensin sensitive Na+/H+ gradient.\r"

The endothelial cells lining the capillary loops were also abnormal with many dilated regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum that contained amorphous electron-opaque material. Immunogold studies showed that type IV collagen and laminin/entactin were distributed throughout the thickened GBM, and also within the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum of the endothelial cells. These results show that the interferon-induced lesion within the glomerulus is associated with an accumulation of normal GBM components and that endothelial cells are involved in this pathologic process.\r"

These treatments also reduced plasma insulin and glucose levels, and were hepatotoxic. The inhibition of insulin secretion, however, was transient. Islets isolated from treated hamsters that were then placed in culture secreted elevated levels of insulin for many months. When cultured islets were directly exposed to the nitrosamines for 3 days, there was also a transient reduction of insulin secretion that was subsequently normalized after removal of the nitrosamine from the medium. These results show that BOP and HPOP modify beta-cell function both directly, and possibly indirectly, via damage to the liver. Furthermore, the lack of immediate inhibition of insulin secretion when islets were incubated in the presence of BOP or HPOP as well as glucose, suggests that the nitrosamines do not bind to the glucose receptor.\r"

The CB treatment caused a change in the IFs at the cell border associated with a change in the distribution of microfilaments. The IFs at the cell border were partially disrupted. Actin aggregates were localized at points where IFs had condensed together. The pericanalicular sheath was intact but very dilated. These results indicated that the CB treatment caused an irregular distribution of the microfilaments at the cell periphery but spared the actin at the bile canaliculus. Cytokeratin staining by IMF was markedly decreased or absent; however, IEM clearly showed the presence of nonstaining IFs after CB treatment. These results indicated that the antigenic determinant of normal cytokeratin IFs became masked after CB treatment. The results indicate that F-actin disassembly induced by CB affects both the organization and conformation of cytokeratins associated with loss of integrity of the plasma membrane and vesicular uptake of plasma proteins by hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations on polysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM in human kidney have demonstrated its presence during nephrogenesis in embryonic kidney, absence in normal adult kidney, and reexpression in Wilms' tumor. These data showed that polysialic acid of NCAM is an onco-developmental antigen in human kidney and provided more direct evidence for the metanephric origin of Wilms' tumor. In the present study, five cases of Wilms' tumor associated with nephroblastomatosis complexes were immunohistochemically investigated with a monoclonal antibody for the presence of polysialic acid. Regardless of the type of nephroblastomatosis complex, ie, renal nodular blastema, simple tubular metanephric hamartoma, sclerosing metanephric hamartoma with adenoma, or incipient Wilms' tumor, immunoreactivity for polysialic acid was found in the blastemal cells, but was undetectable in all other structural elements. Because only blastemal cells exhibited a characteristic feature of embryonal differentiating metanephric derivatives, it appears that Wilms' tumor has its origin not exclusively in nodular renal blastema but rather in blastemal cells present in the various forms of nephroblastomatosis complex. The presence of polysialic acid of NCAM in blastemal cells in such lesions indicates that further events in addition to the expression of the embryonic form of this cell adhesion molecule may be involved in the pathogenesis of Wilms' tumor.\r"

The effect of C3d,g preparations on neutrophil responses in a neonatal rat model of group B streptococcal infection in which neutrophil mobilization from the marrow is inadequate has been evaluated. Dimeric and monomeric fragments of C3d,g were isolated from human serum; the identity of the C3d,g preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Uninfected neonatal rats responded to intraperitoneal injection of C3d,g with a peripheral blood neutrophilia at 30 minutes and 4 hours after inoculation. C3d,g, which lacks intrinsic chemotactic activity, enhanced the local accumulation of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of infected, but not uninfected, neonatal rats. In addition, myeloid cell release from the marrow of isolated femurs of neonatal rats receiving C3d,g was significantly enhanced. Thus, the effect of C3d,g in this model was to mobilize marrow cells and induce peripheral leukocytosis. Chemotactic factors released at the site of infection then resulted in the local accumulation of these inflammatory cells. Complement-derived components capable of releasing marrow myeloid elements may play a major role in determining the outcome of bacterial infection in the immature host.\r"

A strong impression exists among investigators that efforts to improve ventilatory support, correct abnormalities in cardiac output and intravascular volume, and maintain adequate nutrition in critically ill patients may have contributed to the decreased incidence and prevalence of stress gastritis over the past decade. In addition, reduction of intragastric acidity, either by titration with antacids or administration of H2 antagonists, further prevented stress gastritis in these patients. We have every reason to believe that progress will continue at the same rate in the decades before us in this area of investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-two fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) were performed in 79 patients, yielding a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 100 percent for malignancy. Seven different malignant cell types were identified: squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, large cell, small cell, carcinoid, embryonal cell, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. A 94 percent correct correlation between the cytologic and histologic specimens was achieved. Pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy complicated 11 percent of the biopsies. Thoracotomy was avoided in 35 percent of patients considered for operation because FNAB documented benign disease, metastatic disease, or small-cell carcinoma. FNAB was able to provide a pathologic diagnosis for chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. A diagnosis was obtained prior to operation in 98 percent of thoracotomies. Only one diagnostic thoracotomy and one thoracotomy for unresectable pulmonary malignancy were required in a 4-year period. We concluded that FNAB, a highly sensitive and specific procedure with a low morbidity rate and a high correlation with histologic findings, reduces the need for diagnostic thoracotomy.\r"

Aspirates were obtained by surgical residents, prepared by a cytotechnologist present at the procedure, and evaluated by a single pathologist. Cytologic findings were interpreted as positive or highly suspicious for malignancy, normal or benign, or insufficient. All patients underwent open biopsy. Patients with positive or highly suspicious cytologic findings who preferred partial mastectomy and radiotherapy were offered a segmental mastectomy. No patient was offered total mastectomy based on cytologic findings alone. There were two false-positive and two false-negative results, for a 92 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity. The value of needle aspiration biopsy lies in its ability to identify patients at high risk for malignancy. Total mastectomy cannot be recommended based on cytologic findings alone. The setting of a surgical residency program does not adversely affect the reliability of the technique.\r"

(2) Doppler examination of the deep venous system of the lower extremities, although more accurate than clinical evaluation, was of insufficient accuracy to make correct decisions regarding the need for anticoagulation.\r"

The clinical presentation was consistent for the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli in all 55 patients. The scans were divided into the following four categories according to standard guidelines: normal, low, intermediate, and high probability. Three patients had normal scans confirmed by arteriography; 34 patients had high-probability scans, but only 22 (65 percent) were positive at arteriography. The remaining 18 patients had low or intermediate-probability scans (9 patients each), 5 of whom (28 percent) were positive at angiography (sensitivity 82 percent, specificity 57 percent). This study demonstrates the inaccuracy of ventilation-perfusion scanning for the evaluation of pulmonary embolus and may represent the variability of interpretation at individual institutions. Perhaps each institution may need to compare the results of ventilation-perfusion scanning and angiography to optimally select and treat patients.\r"

In three cases, intervention prevented graft failure. The primary patency rate was 80 percent, but was improved to 95 percent as a result of graft surveillance and simple revisions. Duplex scanning is a superior method for postoperative in situ saphenous vein bypass surveillance. We recommend that patients be studied 1 month postoperatively and every 3 to 6 months thereafter.\r"

Seven patients underwent subsequent liver transplantation because of deteriorating hepatic function, and two patients died before transplantation could be performed. Although there were no significant differences in outcome of liver transplantation whether or not a biliary procedure had been performed previously, previous biliary tract procedures influenced the type of biliary reconstruction performed, and two complications occurred as direct results of prior operations. Nontransplant procedures should be restricted to those patients with primarily extrahepatic obstruction, whereas liver transplantation should be considered the initial procedure of choice for patients with diffuse sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

These complications were primarily related to biliary tract reconstruction, bowel complications, and septic complications. None of the factors examined, except a second transplant procedure, proved helpful in identifying those patients most likely to experience surgical complications; however, a risk factor scoring system was found to accurately identify that group of patients at highest risk of dying in the postoperative period. Only 2 of 21 deaths could be attributed directly to the surgical complication. We believe that a policy of prompt, aggressive surgical intervention, coupled with careful tailoring of immunosuppression to both the patient and the clinical situation, can lead to a low mortality rate in patients who require reoperation.\r"

The use of the former enabled epidural blockade to above the T6 dermatome to be established in a significantly shorter time than with bupivacaine (p less than 0.005). The quality of sensory blockade and incidence of complications was similar in the two groups. The solutions were of similar potency as measured by the volume required per segment blocked. Motor blockade was more intense with 2% lignocaine with adrenaline (p less than 0.03). More neonates had moderately depressed Apgar scores (5-7) at one minute in the lignocaine group but this difference was not statistically significant, and there was no difference in the distribution of Apgar scores at 3 minutes. Lignocaine with 1/200,000 adrenaline is a useful alternative to 0.5% plain bupivacaine when it is desired to establish rapidly epidural blockade for Caesarean section.\r"

Sugar-free home diet was maintained and an \"open\" challenge to a large dose (3 g/kg) of candy bar sucrose was given. Subsequent behavior was noted by actometer, quantitative playroom observation using several standard behavioral tests, and ability to do maze drawings. No significant changes were found on the open challenge test. A slight change from baseline was noted in seven cases on three or four behavioral parameters. Five of these children agreed to a double-blind challenge test utilizing lemon-flavored slushes of sucrose, honey, tapioca starch, or aspartame, administered after a standard lunch free of sucrose. One child reacted to both sucrose and honey and another child reacted only to sucrose. These two children were challenged a second time. The child who reacted to honey again did so according to actometer readings, but this time not by Stony Brook test. To sugar, he reacted only at the 70-minute Stony Brook. The other child reacted to placebo instead of sucrose when rechallenged. The results indicate that high doses of sugar are not related to abnormal behavior. \"Open\" challenge was sufficient to rule out such a relationship in most instances. A repeated double-blind challenge confirmed the absence of a sugar effect in cases showing initial possibility of response.\r"

In an open-chest preparation, LV end-systolic and diastolic dimensions were measured with ultrasonic crystal transducers seated subendocardially along the anterior to posterior and apex to base axes. In the group studied during hypoxia, measurements were obtained during 3 conditions: normoxia; hypoxia to a PO2 of 30 mm Hg; and during hypoxia when aminophylline was infused to a blood level of about 15 mg/L. In the group studied under normoxic conditions, measurements were initially obtained during normoxia after which aminophylline was also infused to a blood level of 15 mg/L. Intravascular volume was given or removed to maintain LV filling pressures at about 10 mm Hg during all conditions. In the normoxic group, aminophylline caused an increase in stroke volume (SV) and had a positive inotropic effect on the LV. End-systolic dimensions were reduced, while end-diastolic dimensions did not change with aminophylline. On the other hand, under hypoxic conditions, aminophylline did not have a positive inotropic effect: SV did not increase and end-systolic dimensions remained unchanged. Under hypoxic conditions, moreover, aminophylline caused a slight decrease in end-diastolic dimensions by augmenting hypoxia-induced increases in myocardial resting tension. Our results indicate that unlike normoxic conditions, aminophylline may have little beneficial effect on LV performance during hypoxic conditions.\r"

Methacholine (12.5 mg/ml) or histamine (12.5 mg/ml) was continuously inhaled during tidal breathing until a nearly twofold increase in Rrs was observed. Large airway response was determined by VD, and overall airway response was determined by Rrs. Small airways response was inferred from Rrs when the change in VD was slight. Inhalation of methacholine and histamine increased Rrs with decreased VD, but the decrease in VD was significantly greater with methacholine than with histamine for an equivalent change in Rrs (p less than 0.01). Inhalation of atropine (5 mg/ml) decreased Rrs with a simultaneous increase in VD. After inhalation of atropine, time required for a twofold increase in Rrs by histamine inhalation was prolonged, and histamine did little decrease VD. These results suggest that the predominant site of cholinergically mediated constriction is the large airways, and that histamine constricts the large airways in part via a cholinergic reflex mechanism and constricts the small airways via its direct action in normal subjects.\r"

Pulmonary histopathology was assessed microscopically, and cell counts and 125I-labeled albumin (125I-albumin) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung wet/dry weight ratios were determined. Five groups of animals were studied; the 2 TNF groups received high (1.4 X 10(6) U/kg) or low (1.0 X 10(6) U/kg) doses of rHuTNF alpha, the sepsis group received 2 X 10(9) Escherichia coli/kg intravenously, and the control group received saline.

The intraluminal pressures required to close and reopen the upper airways were measured in the isolated upper airways of anesthetized rabbits. Atropine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), given to reduce the volume of upper airway secretions, had no effect on closing or on reopening pressures. Stimulation of upper airway secretions in 6 animals with methacholine (0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously) changed closing pressures from -10.63 +/- 0.57 to -16.91 +/- 0.60 cm H2O (p less than 0.05) but made the airway less likely to reopen, changing reopening pressures from -3.45 +/- 0.48 to -2.12 +/- 0.39 cm H2O (p less than 0.04), and caused frequent failure of the airway to reopen spontaneously. Filling the upper airways with saline to mimic the hydrostatic forces present in the mucus-filled airway caused both closing and reopening pressures to become more negative. We conclude that reopening pressure is influenced by the secretions lining the airway surface, and, therefore, that airway closure and airway reopening may be substantially independent.\r"

  ".W": "It was investigated whether an endotoxin-induced airway inflammation and injury correlated with the induction of bronchial hyperreactivity. Guinea pigs were treated with an endotoxin aerosol, and 4 and 24 h later lung lavages were performed and a differential cell count was made. The number of neutrophils and monocytes was significantly increased (p less than 0.005) at these times. After 24 h, the number of eosinophils and lymphocytes was also increased (p less than 0.005). The number of alveolar macrophages remained unchanged. Histologic examination revealed increased intraluminal mucus and an influx of erythrocytes and neutrophils in the tracheal and bronchial lumen at both time points after the endotoxin aerosol. The epithelium was morphologically changed and contained many neutrophils. Focal matting and/or loss of cilia also occurred. Airway smooth muscle responsiveness was measured in vitro on isolated guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle preparations 4 and 24 h after endotoxin aerosol. No differences in the maximal responses or slope factors of the dose-response curves for carbachol, histamine, or isoprenaline were detected between the control and endotoxin-exposed groups. The EC50 value of the histamine dose-response curve 4 h after endotoxin nebulization was slightly but significantly (p less than 0.05) increased, indicating decreased sensitivity. Responsiveness in vivo was measured in anesthetized spontaneously breathing guinea pigs 24 h after the endotoxin aerosol. The histamine-induced increase in pulmonary resistance was reduced by about 35% in the endotoxin-nebulized group (p less than 0.01). It can be concluded that an influx of inflammatory cells accompanied by injury of the airways induces hyporeactivity of the guinea pig respiratory tract.\r"

In another study, a smaller degree of tolerance was also seen when a single-dose challenge was conducted 3 times at 24-h intervals. In these studies, the doses of methacholine used to obtain responses in nonasthmatic subjects were higher than are required under conditions of clinical methacholine challenge as a diagnostic test for asthma. Consequently, these findings may be relevant only to investigations or epidemiologic studies in which serial methacholine challenges are performed at intervals of 24 h or less in nonasthmatic subjects requiring higher cumulative doses of methacholine than do asthmatics.\r"

Nine patients (8 men and 1 woman) with asthma and OSA confirmed on all-night sleep study were studied. All patients suffered from frequent nocturnal asthma attacks, resulting in hospitalizations and respiratory arrests in 3. All patients had symptoms of heavy snoring, nocturnal choking, frequent sleep arousals, and excessive daytime sleepiness. They recorded their daily peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) in the mornings and evenings, before and after bronchodilator in three 2-wk periods consisting of control, nCPAP, and control. During the period of nCPAP therapy, all patients recorded improvement in their PEFR. The mean prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator PEFR for the 9 patients were significantly higher during nCPAP therapy than during both control periods. This study confirms that nCPAP therapy can be used safely in treating patients with OSA and coexisting asthma. Furthermore, nCPAP treatment improves the asthma control and, in particular, the nocturnal attacks in this group of patients. These results also suggest that recurrent upper airway obstruction and snoring may be important triggering mechanisms of nocturnal asthma attacks.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of substance P (SP) with specific receptors in intact lung tissue was autoradiographically visualized, using slide-mounted tissue sections of rat lung tissue. SP receptors are highly concentrated in the central airways and are not detectable in peripheral bronchi, vessels, and alveoli. Within central airways, receptor distribution is most concentrated in the epithelium and small vessels in the lamina propria. Smooth muscle in airway or blood vessel walls expressed no detectable SP receptors. Immunohistochemical staining for SP revealed SP-containing nerves in the same areas where the receptors are localized. Displacement curves of SP bound to rat lung indicated that the C-terminal fragment was much more effective than the N-terminal fragment at competing for SP binding. Injection of 0.3 to 30 nmol/kg SP dramatically increased vascular permeability in the trachea and to a lesser extent in the hilus. Peripheral lung failed to respond to SP with increased vascular permeability unless toxic concentrations of SP were employed. SP increased the transudation of protein into the trachea within 5 min of injection, and the extravasated protein persisted through at least 2 h. Both SP and SP(3-11) were capable of stimulating increased vascular permeability, but SP(1-4) was inactive. SP caused mast cell degranulation as reflected in increased plasma histamine levels after SP or SP(3-11) injection, but SP(1-4) had no effect. In order to determine if histamine release caused by SP contributed to the vascular permeability response, the effects of H1 and H2 antihistamine treatment were studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies have shown that lung capillaries are damaged by oxygen toxicity in the sheep; however, metabolic functions of the pulmonary endothelium have not been examined in this otherwise well-characterized animal model of lung injury. Therefore, we studied the activity of pulmonary endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in five unanesthetized adult sheep that breathed 100% O2 via tracheostomy for 3 days and in four other sheep that breathed compressed air. In contrast to the sheep that breathed air, the sheep that breathed O2 developed substantial arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia, an increased alveolar-to-arterial O2 gradient and a slight respiratory acidosis. Morphological examination of lungs from sheep that breathed O2 revealed a multifocal distribution of injury, including interstitial edema, capillary endothelial damage, and alveolar epithelial damage. Indicator-dilution methods were used to assess first-pass pulmonary metabolism of the ACE substrate [3H]Benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (BPAP) and the apparent kinetics (KM and Vmax) of ACE activity. Pulmonary metabolism of BPAP exhibited saturability, was reduced by an ACE inhibitor (enalaprit), and did not result from the activity of circulating plasma ACE. There was no difference between the 2 groups of sheep in the percent metabolism of either 0.1 mumol BPAP/kg or 1.0 mumol BPAP/kg or in the KM of BPAP metabolism. In both groups, the Vmax and Vmax/KM decreased as a result of reductions in cardiac output and volume distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Those with frequent wheezing at 28 demonstrated a greater decline in their respiratory function since the age of 7 years than the other groups.

In 5 subjects undergoing a 3 x 60 ml BAL, the dilution of introduced fluid was calculated at approximately 25% using both technetium colloid and methylene blue. Thus, there was a total dilution volume of about 225 ml. In the same experiment, tritiated water was incorporated into the introduced fluid, and the degree of dilution of tritium in the aspirate was compared with that of the other 2 markers. The dilution of tritium was greater than anticipated, suggesting that around 55 ml of water had effluxed from the lung segment during BAL. The total fluid gain by the segment during BAL was thus approximately 100 ml (44% of the dilution volume), although the contribution of fluid resident in the lung prior to BAL to this volume was not known. The 3 x 60 ml BAL procedures were performed in a further 5 patients 12 h after they had received tritiated water orally. The concentration of urea, a putative \"endogenous marker\" of dilution, was assayed simultaneously in plasma and aspirate. From these values the fluid normally resident in the lung segment was calculated to contribute at most about 2% to the total aspirated volume. A median of 39% of the 85 ml aspirated was calculated to have come from the circulation or surrounding interstitium by simultaneous measurements of the concentrations of tritium in plasma and lavage aspirate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adult male Lewis rats were studied from 1 h to 120 days after a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (0.5 to 0.6 U/100 g body weight). The retention of 99mTc-DTPA in the lungs, expressed as a percentage of the baseline radioactivity, was determined at 15 min (%R15) after delivery of the tracer. The %R15 was 83.7 +/- 6.0 for normal untreated rats and 84.3 +/- 3.7 for saline-treated animals. The rate of absorption of 99mTc-DTPA began to increase 24 h after bleomycin, reaching a maximum at Day 7, with %R15 = 56.0 +/- 6.5 (p less than 0.0001). Resolution to control values occurred by Day 34 after bleomycin. At Day 45 after bleomycin, the rate of absorption of 99mTc-DTPA was slower than sham (control), with %R15 = 89.2 +/- 1.9 (p less than 0.5). However, from Day 63 onwards, removal was not different from control. The concentration of albumin in the BAL fluid began to increase 48 h after bleomycin, was 10-fold greater than control by Day 7 (150 +/- 38 versus 16 +/- 3 micrograms/ml), and returned to control values by Day 28. The percentage of neutrophils in the BAL increased at 12 h, reached a plateau of 33 +/- 9% between 4 and 7 days, and then returned to control values by Day 14.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To insure that the effects of tachykinins were not limited to the extrathoracic airways and were not dependent on effects of TDI on baseline airway caliber, we determined airway responsiveness to acetylcholine inhaled through a tracheostomy in anesthetized and ventilated guinea pigs that were exposed to TDI or air after treatment with the tachykinin antagonist spantide, the tachykinin metabolism inhibitor phosphoramidon, or the vehicles for each drug. When these drugs were administered before and during TDI exposure, spantide significantly inhibited the TDI-induced increase in acetylcholine responsiveness and phosphoramidon significantly potentiated this effect, whereas neither drug altered acetylcholine responsiveness in air-exposed animals. To determine whether tachykinins were exerting their effect primarily during TDI exposure or during the subsequent acetylcholine challenge, we also examined the effect of each drug on acetylcholine responsiveness when the drugs were given after TDI exposure. At that time, spantide did not inhibit TDI-induced acetylcholine hyperresponsiveness and phosphoramidon did not potentiate it. Neither drug nor TDI increased pulmonary resistance measured through a tracheostomy in these anesthetized and ventilated animals. These results suggest that the TDI-induced increase in acetylcholine responsiveness is mediated by release of tachykinins into the intrathoracic airways during exposure to TDI.\r"

We sought to determine macrophage cytotoxicity and interleukin-1 elaboration in density-defined subpopulations of macrophages during tissue inflammation. At all time points after intravenously administered BCG, lavaged alveolar macrophages contained increased percentages of higher density cells. Alveolar macrophage cytotoxicity against the rat sarcoma cell line XC increased maximally 2 to 6 days after intravenous administration of BCG before declining on Day 13. Macrophage interleukin-1 elaboration increased maximally 14 days after administration of BCG before declining on Day 23. Additionally, macrophage cytotoxicity and interleukin-1 elaboration were increased above normal in cells from each of five density fractions. We conclude that a subpopulation of higher density macrophages, probably recently derived from blood monocytes, accumulates in inflammatory sites. Cellular activation increases the cytotoxicity and interleukin-1 elaboration by macrophages in all density-defined subpopulations and obscures the relationship between cellular density and function that is present in normal animals.\r"

All the patients were previously healthy. Water loads were administered during illness and after recovery. Extracellular fluid volume, arterial blood pressure, PaO2, and PaCO2 were identical during and after pneumonia. By contrast, renal water excretion was markedly impaired during pneumonia and returned to normal values after recovery. This was attested to by a significant decrease in minimum urine osmolality together with significant increases in the percentage of the excreted water load and the maximum free water clearance, after resolution of the pneumonia. Plasma arginine vasopressin values were significantly higher during pneumonia than after recovery despite similar plasma sodium concentrations, both before and after water load. A positive correlation between plasma arginine vasopressin and minimum urine osmolality was found during pneumonia. Thus, impairment in renal water excretion appeared to be due to resetting of the vasopressin osmostat and could not be attributed to any recognized nonosmotic stimulus for vasopressin secretion. On the other hand, these defects varied in severity depending on the extent of the pneumonia and persisted until clearing of alveolar opacities, accounting for their protracted course in some patients. We conclude that water excretion is impaired in most if not in all patients with acute infectious pneumonia (especially if extended), and that the administration of hypotonic solutions should be avoided in these patients.\r"

Fifteen of the masses were malignant and 30 were benign. The diagnoses were histologically confirmed by examination of surgical or autopsy specimens. Only teratoma could be confidently diagnosed by ultrasonography alone. Diagnosis of other types of mediastinal masses required examination of tissue samples. Using ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy (UGAB), we were able to diagnose 13 of 15 malignant tumors and 18 of 27 benign mediastinal masses. Ultrasonically guided cutting biopsy was performed in conjunction with UGAB in 11 patients, and the diagnosis was histologically confirmed in 9 cases. Complications with UGNB occurred in only 1 case. Our results indicate that UGNB is a safe, simple technique that can be applied to most of the mediastinal masses. We believe that it is the method of choice in such cases.\r"

  ".W": "The protean effects of undernutrition on lung defenses and repair capabilities suggest that less than adequate nutritional support is a key pathogenetic factor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Very-low-birthweight (VLBW, less than or equal to 1,000 g) premature infants who require intensive respiratory support have a distressingly high incidence of chronic lung disease or BPD. Many VLBW infants are currently undernourished during the most acute phase of their respiratory illness. Because VLBW newborns have only meager caloric reserves (fat, glycogen), and have only marginally sufficient stores of nutrients needed for effective lung defenses and repair capacity (vitamins A and E, copper, zinc, iron, selenium, essential fatty acids, etc.), the adequacy of nutritional support provided them will almost certainly influence their ability to tolerate early stress, and it may play a critical role in their clinical outcome. Experimental studies, combined with a limited number of clinical studies, clearly demonstrate that undernutrition can interact with each of the other well-accepted etiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. Nutritional status affects the lung's ability to resist hyperoxic damage, to replace damaged/sloughed lung cells caused by barotrauma, to promote continued lung growth, to resist infection, and to tolerate prolonged and potentially toxic stresses in general. By providing more ideal nutritional support, clinicians may be able to apply preventive treatment to influence the outcome of intensive respiratory therapy in the VLBW newborn.\r"

All had demonstrated at least a 15% change in FEV1 either spontaneously or after bronchodilator. Bronchodilator effect was measured serially for 4 h after inhalation of the initial dose and again after 2 wk of four-times-daily use. Significant bronchodilator effect was seen initially with AMN when compared to placebo (p less than 0.01). After 2 wk of use, the bronchodilator effect of AMN was significantly diminished as compared to the initial effect (p less than 0.01) but was still better than placebo (p less than 0.05). Subsensitivity did develop to varying degrees in the patients, but we were unable to identify any clinical parameters that would allow prediction of subsequent subsensitivity. We conclude that the development of subsensitivity to AMN occurs in certain patients with chronic administration but does not reflect a total loss of bronchodilator effect.\r"

Furthermore, interstitial macrophages are believed to be precursor to alveolar macrophages, which have recently been shown to be heterogeneous in their ability to synthesize and release prostaglandins. Considering the apparent importance of prostaglandin synthesis and release in inflammatory and immune responses, the current study was undertaken to determine if interstitial macrophage subpopulations differ in their ability to synthesize and release prostaglandin (PG) E, PGI2, and thromboxane (Tx) A2 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187, zymosan, or aggregated IgG. Interstitial macrophages were harvested and separated into 18 density-defined fractions. Density-defined interstitial macrophages (DD-IM) showed marked heterogeneity in prostaglandin synthesis and release. Maximal PGE synthesis and release was seen as a single broad peak after calcium ionophore A23187 and zymosan stimulation. In contrast, no peak in PGE synthesis was seen after aggregated IgG stimulation. PGI2 synthesis also was seen as a single broad peak generated by the lower density interstitial macrophage subpopulations after all stimuli. Similarly, TxA2 synthesis and release was maximal from a broad range of various DD-IM after calcium ionophore A23187, zymosan, and aggregated IgG stimulation. Furthermore, the synthesis and release of TxA2 correlated with the presence of zymosan and IgG receptors on DD-IM. The results demonstrate that DD-IM are heterogeneous in ability to synthesize and release prostaglandins, which are dependent on the stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation of grain dusts can cause symptoms of both acute and chronic bronchitis, which has been associated with a neutrophilic inflammatory response in the lung. Since this influx of neutrophils may potentially result in bronchial injury, mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment to grain dust were examined. Sterile, aqueous grain dust extracts were prepared from settled dusts of grain sorghum, corn, oats, and soybeans. The extracts were evaluated for their ability to directly attract human neutrophils using a blindwell neutrophil chemotaxis assay. Each extract was found to possess significant chemotactic activity compared to control (p less than 0.01). To evaluate if the dusts could attract neutrophils indirectly by activating humoral inflammatory mechanisms, the grain dust extracts were evaluated for their ability to activate the complement system. When incubated with normal human serum, each of the grain dusts caused cleavage of the complement proteins C3 and properdin factor B (PFB). Importantly, the grain dust extracts lead to the generation of C5a, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant generated by complement activation. Since activation of the alveolar macrophage to release chemotactic activity represents an additional indirect mechanism of neutrophil recruitment, an extract from grain sorghum dust was evaluated for its ability to stimulate guinea pig and human alveolar macrophages to release neutrophil chemotactic activity. The results demonstrate that supernatants obtained from alveolar macrophages cultured in the presence of grain sorghum dust extract possessed increased chemotactic activity compared to controls (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several different techniques for introducing foreign DNA into cells have been described but have either not been useful for respiratory epithelial cells or are difficult and cumbersome to perform. Electroporation is a simple technique that consists of exposing a cell-DNA suspension to an electric shock. Although it has been used to introduce genes into a variety of cell types, it has not previously been applied to respiratory epithelial cells. Human nasal epithelial cells were transfected with the plasmid pRSVCAT, which is an expression vector containing the origin of replication of pBR322 coupled to the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) region driving the coding sequence for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The CAT gene is useful for determining optimal conditions for electroporation since it is not normally present in eukaryotic cells, and CAT activity correlates with the level of CAT mRNA; this provides a measure of expression of introduced foreign genes. Successful expression of the CAT gene was demonstrated by electroporation, whereas calcium phosphate transfection resulted in very low CAT activity. Optimal conditions for electroporation of respiratory epithelial cells were determined. Electroporating nasal epithelial cells using 500 volts, a DNA concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, and a sucrose buffer yielded the highest CAT activity, which peaked at 48 h after electroporation.\r"

NAPP of 10 to 12 cm H2O was associated with a significant increase in airway area throughout the upper airway in all three groups. The change in airway area per cm H2O NAPP increased from nasopharynx to hypopharynx. The change in airway area per cm H2O NAPP was significantly smaller in the OSA than in the normal subjects in the region of the soft palate. Electromyographic recordings of the genioglossus and alae nasi muscles with and without NAPP during wakefulness in five of the OSA and five of the normal subjects showed either a decrease or no change in phasic and tonic activity with NAPP. In a separate series of experiments in an additional five OSA and five normal subjects, NAPP of zero, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O was associated with a linear increase in airway area at a given airway level. These results indicate that (1) the increase in pharyngeal cross-sectional area with application of NAPP during wakefulness is smaller in OSA than in normal subjects in the region of the soft palate and (2) changes in upper airway muscle activity may accompany changes in upper airway size and configuration.\r"

  ".U": "89075371\r", 
  ".W": "Since neutrophils may be important in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, we sought to determine whether injury produced by endotoxin in vivo would be modified by pentoxifylline, which decreases neutrophil adherence and lessens neutrophil activation in vitro. Anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms/kg Salmonella enteriditis endotoxin intravenously after pretreatment with either saline or pentoxifylline 20 mg/kg intravenously administered followed by a continuous 0.1 mg/kg/min infusion. Two hours after endotoxin, pulmonary vascular permeability to protein was assessed as the lung extravascular accumulation of intravenously administered 113mIn-transferrin. Results expressed as the ratio of extra- to intravascular protein activities showed a clear increase over control values in dogs treated with endotoxin [0.064 +/- 0.003 (mean +/- SEM) and 0.31 +/- 0.14 respectively, p less than 0.05]. This increase with endotoxin was reversed by pentoxifylline to levels similar to control values (0.063 +/- 0.044, p less than 0.05). To determine whether pentoxifylline influenced neutrophil sequestration, thin sections of lung tissue were analyzed for neutrophil density using an intercept counting technique. Neutrophil density was doubled in dogs treated with endotoxin over that seen in controls (0.078 +/- 0.008 versus 0.042 +/- 0.006 neutrophils per alveolar septa, respectively, p less than 0.05) and this increase was significantly reduced by pentoxifylline treatment (0.048 +/- 0.009, p less than 0.05). Endotoxin increased lung retention of radiolabeled neutrophils and this was also prevented by pretreatment of the neutrophils with pentoxifylline. In summary, pentoxifylline decreases neutrophil accumulation and prevents the increase in pulmonary vascular permeability to protein induced by endotoxin. These data support the premise that pentoxifylline is protective against endotoxin-induced lung injury in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "89075372\r", 
  ".W": "The adherence of neutrophils (PMN) to endothelium is a crucial early step in neutrophil-mediated vascular injury. However, vascular injury is not a necessary event in inflammatory states, which suggests that endogenous mechanisms may protect endothelial cells from neutrophil-mediated injury. Previous studies suggested that leukocytes adhered in greater numbers to vascular endothelium in vivo and in vitro, where the contiguity of the cells was disrupted and where endothelial cells were actively migrating and proliferating. We studied the effect of development of a confluent monolayer on adherence of human PMN to cultured bovine calf aortic endothelial cells and investigated several mechanisms by which this effect might occur. We found that adherence of quiescent and activated PMN decreased with development of a confluent endothelial cell monolayer. A similar effect was found using human umbilical-vein endothelial cells. In contrast, adherence of nylon wool-nonadherent, thymus-derived lymphocytes increased. Variation in neutrophil adherence was not due to adherence of PMN to exposed tissue culture plastic or to exposed matrix components in preconfluent cultures, nor due to products released into culture supernatants. Diminished PMN adherence to postconfluent monolayers may have been related to changes in endothelial cell glycoproteins because neuraminidase or cycloheximide pretreatment augmented PMN adherence to postconfluent cultures more than to preconfluent cultures. However, the extent of total cell surface sialation, as assessed by neuraminidase-releasable [3H]glucosamine from metabolically labeled monolayers, did not differ between pre- and postconfluent cultures, suggesting that some specific sialated cell surface constituent is responsible for decreased PMN adherence to postconfluent monolayers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89075382\r", 
  ".W": "We wished to evaluate the role of dynamic hyperinflation and dynamic airway compression as potential sources of exertional dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The rationale was that if such factors contribute importantly, then the administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which serves to unload the inspiratory muscles and attenuate dynamic compression on expiration, should improve respiratory sensation. Further partitioning of CPAP into its continuous positive inspiratory pressure (CPIP) and continuous positive expiratory pressure (CPEP) components permitted an assessment of the relative importance of the above factors with respect to respiratory sensation. CPAP, CPIP, and CPEP (4 to 5 cm H2O each) were administered intermittently (for intervals of 40 to 60 s on each occasion) in random order during steady-state submaximal exercise in five patients with COPD (average FEV1, 40% predicted) and in five normal healthy subjects. Changes in the sense of breathing effort during the various pressure applications were assessed by asking the subjects to point to a category scale of -5 to +5, where -5 indicated that breathing was markedly easier and +5 indicated that breathing was markedly harder. CPAP, when administered to the COPD group, resulted in a highly significant (p less than 0.005) reduction in the sense of breathing effort. By contrast, CPAP significantly increased the sense of breathing effort in the normal group (p less than 0.01). CPIP facilitated breathing in both the COPD group and the normal group (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and other granulocytes in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury caused by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), we compared the permeability edema and pulmonary histopathology in normal (granulocyte sufficient) guinea pigs and in granulocytopenic guinea pigs treated with TNF. Circulating granulocytes were depleted with cyclophosphamide. Two groups of normal animals were treated with either saline (PMN+/Control) or 1.4 x 10(6) U/kg recombinant human TNF (PMN+/TNF). Three granulocytopenic groups were treated with either saline (PMN-/Control), TNF (PMN-/TNF), or intravenous infusion of 2 x 10(9) E. coli strain J96 (PMN-/Sepsis). We measured the amount of 125I-labeled albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and whole lung tissue and the wet/dry lung weight ratio to assess pulmonary transvascular protein flux and edema. We also quantified PMN in BAL fluid and fixed lung tissue. There were no statistically significant differences in any of these parameters between the PMN+/Control, PMN-/Control, or PMN-/TNF groups, except that the PMN+/Control predictably had more PMN/alveolus than the PMN- groups. However, both the PMN+/TNF and the PMN-/Sepsis groups had increased amounts of 125I-labeled albumin in BAL fluid and lung tissue (p less than 0.01) and increased wet/dry lung weight ratios (p less than 0.05), compared to all other groups. Histopathologically, capillary congestion and moderate inflammation were seen in the PMN+/TNF group, and acute inflammation and gross alveolar hemorrhage were seen in the PMN-/Sepsis group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen of the 61 sera were obtained from patients with histologically established lung cancer. Using a semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), TAAs were detected by the MAb panel in the sera of 12 lung cancer patients, yielding a sensitivity of 67% with a 95% confidence interval of 44 to 84%. The frequency of TAA detection varied among cell types and stages of disease. There were eight false positives and 35 true negatives, giving a specificity of 81% with a 95% confidence interval of 67 to 90%. Two of the false positives came from patients with nonpulmonary tumors known to cross-react with the MAbs (laryngeal and gastric carcinoma). The panel was able to distinguish patients with lung cancer from those without to a highly significant degree (chi 2 = 11.2 with 1 df, p less than 0.001). This study suggests that MAb-mediated detection of serum TAAs may be useful in diagnosing and characterizing lung cancers.\r"

Two hours after treatment, animals were challenged with Staphylococcus aureus by either low dose aerosol inhalation or high dose intratracheal instillation of the bacteria into the lungs. Quantitative lung bacteriologic examination and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for total and differential cell counts were performed immediately (zero hour) and at 4 h after bacterial challenge. Lung phagocytic defenses against aerosolized S. aureus challenges are provided solely by the alveolar macrophage (AM) in the absence of inflammation. In aerosol-challenged control rats, 20.6 +/- 2.0% of the initial deposited bacterial challenge remained viable in the lung at 4 h. Animals pretreated with endotoxin, however, showed a significant decrease in pulmonary bactericidal activity (31.3 +/- 3.4% bacteria remaining at 4 h), indicating a defect in alveolar macrophage (AM) function. Further assessment of the bactericidal oxidative metabolism of endotoxin-treated AM by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence indicated an increased production of free radical oxygen species when compared with control nontreated cells in both the unstimulated (66 +/- 4 versus 38 +/- 7 x 10(3) cpm in control) and stimulated (250.5 +/- 17.1 versus 147.1 +/- 6.2 x 10(3) cpm in control) states.

We used intratracheal instillation of silica suspensions in adult male rats to cause neutrophil flux (32% increase over saline controls) without creating a protein leak, so simulating an early inflammatory response. We examined the in vivo effects of a known phospholipase A2 inhibitor (mepacrine) and the two mast cell active agents (cyproheptadine and reserpine) on lung lavage fluid chemotactic capability, alveolar macrophage (AM) production of chemotactic factor(s), and neutrophil diapedesis. Only mepacrine significantly depressed the leukocytosis (from 32% to 8% of total cells), with a similar diminution in AM chemotaxin production. Separate in vitro experiments using mepacrine-pretreated neutrophils and macrophages gave evidence that mepacrine: (1) diminishes neutrophil response to chemotaxin(s), (2) inhibits spontaneous, random neutrophil movement, and (3) diminishes macrophage-derived chemotactic factor production. These observations suggest that the earliest events in alveolar inflammatory reactions probably involve local production of chemotactic factors by AM, and that mepacrine's anti-inflammatory action results from inhibitory influences on both macrophage and neutrophil populations.\r"

After a 1-wk placebo washout period, patients were administered either procaterol 0.05 mg twice daily for 2 wk followed by 0.10 mg twice daily for 10 wk or albuterol 2 mg three times a day for 2 wk followed by 4 mg three times a day for 10 wk. Spirometry determinations 1.5 h postdose showed consistently greater percent improvements from predose in FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 with procaterol than with albuterol at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Treatment differences were statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) after 2 wk, 2 months, and 3 months of treatment. Bronchodilatation was evident 0.5 h after dosing and peaked at 1.5 to 3 h postdose for both treatments. The duration of action (i.e., time until spirometry determinations were lower than those at 0.5 h postdose) was at least 5 h after procaterol but only 3 h after albuterol. There was no evidence of tolerance with continued procaterol treatment, whereas a diminished duration of response to albuterol was observed with long-term treatment. Tremor was reported statistically more frequently in patients receiving procaterol than in those receiving albuterol (alpha = 0.05); the frequencies of other adverse events were similar for the two groups. No statistically significant treatment differences were noted for asthma symptoms, global evaluations, ECG results, vital signs, or clinical laboratory measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased inspiratory muscle work may contribute to dyspnea causation and exercise limitation in such patients even before their ventilatory ceiling is attained. In this setting, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should, by favorably affecting inspiratory muscle function and respiratory sensation, improve exercise performance. Six patients with chronic airflow limitation (CAL) (FEV1 +/- SD = 35 +/- 12% predicted) undertook constant-load, submaximal, cycle exercise at 50% of their predetermined maximal oxygen consumption: CPAP of 4 to 5 cm H2O was delivered during one exercise session and bracketed by one or two unassisted control sessions. In four patients, CPAP-assisted (4 to 5 cm H2O) exercise was bracketed by two unassisted control exercise sessions; two remaining patients undertook CPAP-assisted exercise and one unassisted control session. CPAP resulted in a significant increase in exercise endurance time (TLIM) (by 48%: CPAP TLIM (mean +/- SE) = 8.82 +/- 1.90 min; averaged control TLIM = 5.98 +/- 1.23 min (p less than 0.01). CPAP effectively ameliorated exertional dyspnea in the majority of patients; selected dyspnea ratings (Borg scale) during control (final minute) and CPAP at isotime, at comparable levels of ventilation, were (mean +/- SD) 7.83 +/- 2.25 and 5.5 +/- 2.2, respectively (p less than 0.025). Breathing frequency fell significantly during CPAP application (at isotime) by 17% (p less than 0.02); other steady-state ventilatory variables and end-expiratory lung volumes were not significantly different during CPAP and control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that intermittent ventilatory assistance in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) improves pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Twenty stable patients with severe COPD were recruited from outpatient pulmonary clinics and were randomized to use a poncho wrap, negative-pressure ventilator or to receive standard care. After 6 months, the patients receiving standard care were switched over to the ventilator and vice versa, and follow-up was continued for an additional 6 months. After 3 to 6 months of ventilator use, we observed no clinically significant improvements in FEV1, FVC, blood gas determinations, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and exercise duration. However, 11 of our patients dropped out of the study because of an inability to tolerate the ventilator, and all but one of the nine who completed the study expressed dissatisfaction with it, using it for less time (4.1 h/day) than we recommended. Musculoskeletal pain and inconvenience were the most frequently voiced complaints. Because we did not document that ventilator use actually rested the respiratory muscles in our patients and because duration of ventilator use may have been too brief, we cannot conclude that intermittent rest of respiratory muscles in patients with severe COPD fails to bring about improvement. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the poncho wrap ventilator is poorly tolerated by patients with severe COPD in a typical outpatient setting. We suggest that future trials seek to utilize better tolerated ventilatory assist devices.\r"

The response parameter was the concentration of MC required to induce a 25% decrement in the maximal expiratory flow at 40% of the vital capacity below total lung capacity on the partial expiratory flow-volume curve (PC25MEF40%(P]. Five of 13 subjects demonstrated a ventilatory response to CBE with a 20% or larger decrement in the MEF40%(P); no subject demonstrated such change with NSS. For the group, the maximal decrement in MEF40%(P) was to 76.5 +/- 20.3% of baseline (mean +/- SD), occurring approximately 60 to 90 min after provocation, whereas the largest decrement after normal saline was to 88 +/- 10.6% of baseline, occurring immediately after inhalation. Changes in airway responsiveness to MC were transient. For example, the PC25MEF40%(P) for the group (mean +/- SD) was 51.3 +/- 41.1 mg/ml at baseline and 25.8 +/- 30.3 and 52.2 +/- 57.3 mg/ml at 2 and 8 h. After a pre-sham baseline of 50.4 +/- 43.2 mg/ml, PC25MEF40%(P) was 57.6 +/- 83.8 and 153.8 +/- 148 mg/ml at 2 and 8 h. Repeated measures ANOVA on these acute, same-day changes (i.e., 2 and 8 h after provocation) demonstrated a statistically significant effect of CBE on airway responsiveness (p = 0.048). These data demonstrate that inhalation of CBE, in addition to bronchospasm, causes a transient increase in airway responsiveness.\r"

After the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key fashion with complementary receptors on mucosal surfaces of the host. The adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. At the epithelial cell surfaces, two classic examples of bacterial adherence are the lipoteichoic acid-mediated attachments of group A streptococcal and the type 1 fimbriae-mediated attachment of Escherichia coli. In group A streptococci, the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored to a protein(s) on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. In type 1 fimbriated E. coli, a minor 29-kDa protein located at the tip of the fimbriae interacts with D-mannose residues of glycoprotein receptors on host cells. Similar adhesin-receptor interactions have now been described for a number of pathogenic microbial agents, and undoubtedly play a central role in the early steps of the infectious process.\r"

In contrast to other adenomatous tumors, these caused slowly progressive inner ear symptoms without other signs, hence making differentiation from other benign lesions difficult. In one case, association with von Hippel-Lindau disease is suspected because of a strong family history and recent discovery of a similar lesion in the opposite ear. Bone destruction was found radiographically and clinically with vascular tumor tissue and cysts permeating the bone, causing adjacent bone destruction and remodeling. The histopathologic examination demonstrated this to be a benign process, however, with no direct tumor invasion or other signs of malignancy. Subtotal petrosectomy is a proven approach for complete removal of these tumors. Review of the literature revealed no previous reports of benign adenomas originating in the petrous bone.\r"

Control rats were given 2 gm/kg glucose immediately following ischemia. During the recovery period, until perfusion at 7 days, they were given glucose, 2 gm/kg, twice daily by intraperitoneal injection, and their drinking water was supplemented with 25% glucose. Mortality (p less than 0.05) and postischemic seizure incidence (p less than 0.01) were significantly reduced in the low-dose insulin group compared to the control group. Mortality was increased in the high-dose insulin group compared to the control group and was associated with an increased incidence of postischemic seizures. Neuropathological examination revealed no cortical infarction in the low-dose or high-dose insulin-treated rats compared to a 60% incidence of cortical infarction in the control group. In addition, the high-dose insulin-treated group showed a significant reduction in striatal and hippocampal CA1 selective neuronal necrosis compared to control rats with comparable survivals (p less than 0.05). The findings suggest that postischemic blood glucose concentrations play an important role in modulating both ischemic infarction and selective neuronal necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Excitatory amino acids have been implicated in ischemic neuronal injury. To test this hypothesis in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, lesions of the cortex and striatum were induced in 7-day-old rats by unilaterally ligating their carotid arteries and subjecting them to hypoxic conditions for 2 hours. Brains examined 1 week later demonstrated, within the regions of ischemic damage, a striking preservation of neurons that stained histochemically for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity. Concentrations of the neuropeptides somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, which colocalize in neurons containing NADPH-d, were unaffected in the areas of ischemic damage. The same pattern of injury with sparing of NADPH-d-reactive neurons was reproduced by focal microinfusion of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid, an endogenous N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, into the striatum. These results support the hypothesis that neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury is mediated through excitatory transmitters acting at the NMDA receptor and that the NADPH-d-reactive neurons in the neonate are resistant to excitotoxic damage. This pattern of cell vulnerability is unique to the developing striatum and may relate to the distinct pathological appearance of the basal ganglia that follows neonatal asphyxia.\r"

Median renal parenchymal volume during acute pyelonephritis of the right kidney was 2.70 cm3/kg body weight and of the left kidney 3.10 cm3/kg; this was significantly larger than the volume of control kidneys, which was 1.82 and 2.07 cm3/kg, respectively. The most enlarged kidneys were found among the youngest children. A significant successive decrease in renal size was found during the first four to five weeks after the acute pyelonephritis. Because of enlargement of the kidneys during acute pyelonephritis we suggest that the first renal size determination to be used for following renal growth should be performed after at least four to six weeks.\r"

Renal cortical defects were detected in 65 kidneys by DMSA scan, intravenous urogram, and ultrasound scan combined; 62 (95%) being seen on DMSA scan. The finding of reflux on micturating cystourethrography showed a highly significant correlation with renal defects seen on DMSA scanning, a less close but still significant correlation with abnormalities on intravenous urography, but none with ultrasound scan findings. The sensitivity of the DMSA scan in screening for all grades of reflux is estimated as 0.66, which is higher than that previously reported for the intravenous urogram or ultrasound scan. DMSA scans were less likely to miss grade 3 reflux than the other two methods. DMSA scans are more useful than other upper renal tract imaging techniques in detecting renal defects. Consideration should be given to their use as a first investigation in place of routine intravenous urograms. Ultrasound scans alone will overlook potentially serious urinary tract abnormalities.\r"

All children received alternate day steroids and either azathioprine or cyclosporin A for immunosuppression. There was a significant increase in growth velocity after transplantation in prepubertal children. Growth velocity declined at the expected age of the normal pubertal growth spurt, however, with delay in the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics. Overnight hormone profiles in 17 adolescent subjects with short stature or maturational delay, or both, showed blunting of growth hormone and gonadotrophin pulsatility. It is likely that long term steroid treatment after renal transplantation induces the clinical and endocrine picture of delayed puberty. Failure of growth to accelerate at this time is a cause of short stature, which may have an effect on adult height.\r"

We have carried out a randomised trial among babies less than 1500 g. Seventy one infants were randomised. In 35, the mother was helped to hold her baby in skin to skin contact and encouraged to do so whenever she visited the baby. In 36, the mother was encouraged to handle her baby but without skin to skin contact. Mothers using skin to skin contact lactated for four weeks longer on average than the control group. At 6 months of age the infants who had skin to skin contact cried significantly less than the control group. Skin to skin contact can safely and enjoyably be offered to very low birthweight infants especially in developing countries where the mother's lactation is vital.\r"

The safety and capacity of intracoronary epoprostenol to dilate coronary arteries were assessed in 16 patients undergoing routine coronary angiography. The view that best displayed the left epicardial coronary arteries was selected as a control for each patient. Intracoronary epoprostenol was then given and the angiogram was repeated in the chosen view. The procedure was repeated twice: once with a higher dose of epoprostenol and once after intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Angiograms were coded and analysed by an observer who was unaware of the treatment. The calibre of the arteries was measured from traced projections of the angiograms. The blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram were recorded throughout. The first two patients were given epoprostenol infusions of 2.5 and 5.0 ng/kg per minute to assess safety, and there were no untoward reactions. The next ten patients had epoprostenol infusions of 5.0 and 7.5 ng/kg per minute followed by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. No haemodynamic disturbances occurred and coronary luminal calibre did not change with epoprostenol (mean (SD) luminal diameter: 2.85 (0.62) mm control, 2.80 (0.61) mm at 5.0 ng/kg, and 2.80 (0.54) mm at 7.5 ng/kg), but it did increase significantly with isosorbide dinitrate (to 3.17 (0.36) mm). The last four patients had epoprostenol infusions of 7.5 and 10 ng/kg followed by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and two of them became hypotensive (one after epoprostenol and one after isosorbide dinitrate).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study the distribution of coronary risk factors was measured in an East London borough where the mortality and attack rate from coronary heart disease are higher in the Asian population, predominantly Muslims from Bangladesh, than in the rest of the population. In a sample of 253 men and women aged 35-69 from general practice, mean plasma cholesterol concentrations were lower in Bangladeshi than in European men and women. Mean systolic blood pressures were 10 mm Hg lower in Bangladeshis. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were similar in Bangladeshis and Europeans and factor VII coagulant activity was lower in Bangladeshi than in European men. In contrast with the findings in Hindus in north west London, smoking rates were high in Bangladeshi men and the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids in plasma lipids was lower in Bangladeshis than in Europeans. Diabetes was three times more common in Bangladeshis than in Europeans and serum insulin concentrations measured after a glucose load were twice as high in Bangladeshis. High insulin concentrations in Bangladeshis were associated with high plasma triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant improvement was found in reactions to cold provocation or in numbers of Raynaud's attacks during ketanserin treatment, but intolerable side-effects were common.

With regard to influence on erythema, infiltration, scaling, and area involved, similar improvements were obtained in both treatment groups. Adverse reactions of the hypervitaminosis A type were observed with almost the same frequency and severity in both treatment groups. The mean number of 10 mg capsules used daily was comparable in the two groups: 2.82 (range 1.23-4.67) for acitretin and 2.77 (range 1.60-4.82) for etretinate.

The mean serum HA level was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in RA (171 +/- 39 micrograms/l) than in controls (22.4 +/- 1.6 micrograms/l) and AS patients (30.3 +/- 3.0 micrograms/l). The mean HA level in RA on corticosteroids (98.2 +/- 25.9 micrograms/l) was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that of RA without steroids (220.1 +/- 60.5 micrograms/l). The serum HA levels were not correlated with clinical or serological indicators of inflammatory activity. This increase in serum HA probably reflected an excessive production by rheumatoid synovium and not a lowered catabolism, all patients having normal hepatic function. The origin of the increased synthesis is still unknown. These results suggest that serum hyaluronate is not a universal indicator of inflammation but is perhaps a characteristic of RA.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective double-blind study compared Doppler assessment of the ulnar collateral circulation with the Allen's test and a postocclusive reactive circulatory hyperaemia (PORCH) test in 144 patients (288 hands). The PORCH test involves inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to a supra systolic (+50 mmHg) pressure for two minutes. Prior to cuff deflation, both radial and ulnar arteries are occluded at the wrist; the cuff is then deflated and a 15-second period allowed so as to restore blood flow down to the wrist. Ulnar artery compression is now released and the time to revascularization measured. Fifty-eight per cent of hands with an abnormal Allen's test had a normal ulnar collateral circulation. Results of Allen's test were not significantly affected by patients' sex or smoking status (p greater than 0.1) but there was a significant difference (p = 0.001) in the false positive rates between patients over 40 years of age (0.2) and those under 40 years of age (0.03). Results of the PORCH test were not significantly affected by patients' age, sex or smoking status (p greater than 0.1). With a revascularisation time of 19 sec as a \"cut off\" for ulnar abnormality the PORCH test, unlike the Allen's test, was perfectly predictive of an abnormal ulnar collateral circulation and had no false positives.\r"

A deficiency or excess of extracellular magnesium can produce significant signs and symptoms. Hypomagnesaemia is a common finding in hospitalised patients, especially those in critical care areas. Anaesthetising hypomagnesaemic patients may exacerbate pre-existing cardiovascular disease and increase the risk of perioperative dysrhythmias. A low serum magnesium level usually suggests a total body deficiency of magnesium. Treatment of magnesium deficiency is by parenteral magnesium and should be instituted prior to surgery. Hypermagnesaemia is often iatrogenic and is more likely in patients with renal dysfunction who are receiving oral or parenteral magnesium. The specific antidote is intravenous calcium. Anaesthetised patients with high serum magnesium levels are at risk from hypotension, potentiation of non-depolarising neuromuscular blockers, postoperative respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.\r"

The subjects were recruited from 80 medical-analysis laboratories scattered throughout the country, where they came for biologic blood sample tests. Patients had to be diagnosed as having diabetes, give consent for additional blood sampling, and fill out a short self-questionnaire. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was centrally determined by liquid chromatography (normal range 3.5-6.3%). We found 135 patients (11.5%) who were not drug treated or treated with diet alone, 862 (73.5%) treated with oral agents, and 175 (15.0%) treated with insulin. Among the latter, 79 (6.7%) were defined as true insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. Among patients receiving no drug or a slight dosage or oral agents, 47% were found to be in the normal range of HbA1c. On the other hand, among the patients intensively treated with oral agents or secondarily with insulin, less than half were under fair control (HbA1c less than 7.5%). These results are in agreement with previous estimates of treatment distribution derived from national drug sales data. They provide evidence regarding the particular features of diabetes in France, i.e., low prevalence of IDDM, low consumption of insulin, high consumption of oral agents. The finding of a large proportion of normal HbA1c values in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients suggests a state of overdiagnosis linked to the use of nonspecific criteria of diagnosis in large-scale screening.\r"

The cumulative pregnancy rates, 33% in the danazol group (n = 6), 42% in the MPA group (n = 7), and 46% in the placebo group (n = 6), did not differ significantly from each other. The time to pregnancy after the start of therapy was 17.7 +/- 8.4 (standard deviation [SD]) months in the danazol group, 18.0 +/- 9.0 months in the MPA group and 10.0 +/- 5.8 months in the placebo group with no significant difference between the groups. The abortion rate was 26%, and there was no significant difference among the groups. Cox multivariant analysis did reveal ovarian endometriosis a prognostically significant negative indicator as regards fecundation in endometriosis (P less than 0.05). In summary, correction of infertility alone does not appear to be an indication for the use of danazol or MPA in the treatment of endometriosis, and ovarian endometriotic lesions but not peritoneal ones do make a worse prognosis as regards fecundation in endometriosis.\r"

  ".U": "89079256\r", 
  ".W": "This review discusses the role of three mediators, synthesized by vascular endothelial cells, that help to keep the surface of the normal endothelium nonthrombogenic. The first is prostacyclin, a product of arachidonic acid metabolism discovered in 1976. This labile prostanoid, with a half-life of approximately 3 minutes, relaxes vascular smooth muscle and inhibits the aggregation of blood platelets. Prostacyclin and its analogues are currently being tested clinically for use in cardiovascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension. The second mediator discussed is endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), discovered in 1980, which also relaxes smooth muscle and inhibits the aggregation and adhesion of platelets. Substances that stimulate the release of EDRF include acetylcholine, bradykinin, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate. EDRF is even more labile than prostacyclin, with a half-life of about 6 seconds, and it has recently been identified as nitric oxide. Prostacyclin and EDRF are released together following stimulation of endothelial receptors and synergize to inhibit platelet aggregation. 13-Hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, a third suggested mediator, is not released but acts from inside the cell to make the endothelial surface nonadhesive for circulating blood cells. It is proposed that these three mediators form the endothelial defense mechanism against blood-borne cells and chemicals and that breakdown of this barrier results in diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.\r"

A two-center trial randomized patients to treatment with either prazosin or hydrochlorothiazide; the alternate drug was added if adequate blood pressure control was not achieved with the originally assigned drug, and patients were removed from any drug they were not able to tolerate. After an average of 40 weeks on the assigned drug regimen, a decline was observed in prazosin-treated patients in both serum total cholesterol (-9.3 mg/dl) and serum triglycerides (-33.9 mg/dl). In contrast, an increase in both these lipids was seen in hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients (+5.0 mg/dl for serum total cholesterol and +18.6 mg/dl for serum triglycerides). The net trial differences between the groups were 14.3 mg/dl for total cholesterol and 52.5 mg/dl for triglycerides, in favor of prazosin (p less than 0.001 for both comparisons). These differences in lipids between the two groups persisted into the second year of the trial (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between the drug groups in regard to the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol or its subfractions or low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In patients who required a combination of the two drugs to achieve blood pressure control, the alpha-blocker diminished or eliminated the lipid-raising effects of the diuretic. Both drugs were similar in their ability to control the elevation of diastolic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 10 white patients with mild essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind design to assess the effects of indomethacin with or without the addition of propranolol on blood pressure and vascular prostacyclin biosynthesis, as assessed by the urinary excretion of the major enzymatically produced metabolite of prostacyclin, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Seven patients responded to propranolol with a lowering of mean arterial blood pressure in both supine and upright postures. The fall in mean arterial blood pressure (-14.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg sitting; -17.4 +/- 1.7 mm Hg supine) with propranolol alone was significantly greater than that produced when propranolol was given to patients receiving indomethacin (-7.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg sitting; -7.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg supine). Our drug-responsive patients demonstrated a significantly lower excretion rate of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha than was found in an age and sex-matched group of normal volunteers. With propranolol treatment, drug-responsive patients showed a significant increase in the excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha, such that the mean excretion was not significantly different from that in normal volunteers. Indomethacin caused a significant rise in mean arterial blood pressure and a significant fall in 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion, and it blocked the rise in urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha associated with propranolol therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calculations were done on the basis of plasma-water-concentrations (PWC). Elimination of B2M during HF follows first order kinetics (r = 0.97) and the volume of B2M distribution was calculated to be 17 +/- 2% of body weight. This reflects extracellular volume (ECV). Changes of ECV in HD were induced by weight loss and further provoked by fluid shifts from intra- to extracellular volume and vice versa induced by varying dialysate sodium concentration. These ECV changes were followed by determining inuline in plasma and total dialysate. Changes of B2M concentration correlate well to changes of ECV (r = 0.98). Thus intratreatment concentration changes of B2M in cuprophane dialysis reflect simultaneous changes of B2M distribution volume. This does not exclude the possibility of B2M generation stimulated by dialysis, but proving such effects in vivo will be difficult because of multiple variants, that must be controlled.\r"

In 37 cases (27.2%) only HLA-DR could be detected, whereas in 33 cases (24.3%) HLA-DR was expressed jointly with HLA-DQ. Coexpression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ was found especially often in cutaneous T cell lymphomas, skin tumors, and inflammatory dermatoses.\r"

  ".W": "Adequate levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids are necessary for the normal functioning of most mammalian cells, both to provide fluidity to the cell membrane lipid bilayer and to function as precursors for the synthesis of the regulatory eicosanoids, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. The omega-6 class of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and arachidonic acids, are of special importance as precursors for eicosanoid synthesis. The skin is a particularly good organ in which to study the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids metabolism, inasmuch as either deficiencies of specific PUFA or overproduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids-derived prostaglandin and leukotriene result in specific, clinically recognizable cutaneous diseases. To help understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, polyunsaturated fatty acids metabolism is reviewed here, with emphasis on clinical manifestations of both deficiency syndromes and overproduction of proinflammatory eicosanoids. A rationale is presented for a therapeutic approach to inflammatory disease by dietary manipulation and substitution of omega-6 fatty acids by the unique omega- 3 class of polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish. Evidence for the efficacy of fish oil in the therapy of specific inflammatory diseases is reviewed, as are the caveats regarding its therapeutic use. Dietary manipulations, specifically fish oil additives, appear to hold promise as therapeutic tools for cutaneous diseases.\r"

This association also persisted after controlling, with a logistic model, for atopy and common cold (marker of infection) and after excluding men with a history of asthma, chronic bronchitis, or low FEV1. Study of the differential leukocyte counts has shown that an increase was present for almost every type of leukocyte, and particularly evident for neutrophils.

Ten patients who previously had shown allergen-induced nasal hyperresponsiveness participated. After pretreatment with either placebo or various periods with topical glucocorticosteroids, they were subjected to an initial challenge with three increasing doses of allergen and were rechallenged after 24 hours with the lowest allergen dose from the previous day. The nasal responses were monitored by means of symptom scores and measurements of N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl esterase (TAME) activity in nasal lavages. Five different treatment schedules were used. In the active treatment alternatives, the glucocorticosteroid treatment was started 48, 12 or 2 hours before or 2 hours after the initial allergen challenge. All treatments were continued up to rechallenge on the second day. As the active treatment we used budesonide, 100 micrograms in each nasal cavity every 12 hours. After placebo pretreatment, as expected, there was an increase in nasal symptoms at rechallenge as compared with the initial allergen challenge with the same allergen dose. The mean (+/- SEM) number of sneezes increased from 5.1 +/- 1.7 to 9.5 +/- 2.0 (p less than 0.05), a composite nasal symptoms score increased from 3.3 +/- 0.66 to 4.4 +/- 0.7 (NS), and TAME activity increased from 14.9 +/- 2.83 to 25.3 +/- 0.5 cpm.10(3) (p less than 0.05). Topical glucocorticosteroid treatment abolished this increase in nasal symptoms and TAME activity (p less than 0.05 for all treatment alternatives).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 22 patients with cat asthma who were highly sensitive to cat, we compared, double-blind, the effects of immunotherapy with cat-hair and dander extract (11 patients) with effects of placebo (11 patients). Patients were matched by the dose of the cat extract expressed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) units of Fel d I (previously called cat allergen 1) required for end point reaction in intradermal skin test end point titration (STEPT), for in vitro leukocyte histamine release (LHR), and for the dose of cat extract producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (cat-extract PD20) in bronchoprovocation test. Patients were matched also for bronchoprovocation dose of methacholine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (methacholine PD20). Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. During immunotherapy, doses were increased to maintenance dose of 4.56 FDA units of Fel d I, or, if this were less, to the highest tolerated dose. Systemic reactions to cat-extract immunotherapy were mild and infrequent. Before and during immunotherapy, we measured (in FDA units of Fel d I) cat-extract PD20, cat-extract intradermal STEPT, cat-extract in vitro LHR, serum levels of cat IgG and cat IgE, and methacholine PD20. After they had received 1 year of immunotherapy, patients receiving cat extract, in comparison to patients receiving placebo, had decreased cat-extract PD20 (p less than 0.01), diminished responses to cat-extract intradermal STEPT (p less than 0.025), increased IgE antibodies toward cat extract (p less than 0.01), increased IgG antibodies toward cat extract, Fel d I, and cat albumin (p less than 0.001), but no significant change in cat-extract in vitro LHR or in methacholine PD20. We conclude that cat-extract immunotherapy was well tolerated, significantly decreased skin and bronchial responses to cat extract, and significantly increased IgE antibodies to cat extract and IgG antibodies to cat extract, Fel d I, and cat albumin.\r"

With three different doses of oral azelastine, we have performed a dose-response study to determine its protective effect on the airways against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in 12 patients with mild, atopic asthma. On 4 separate days, patients undertook standardized inhalation-challenge tests with increasing concentrations of histamine (0.03 to 32 mg/ml) 4 hours after placebo or azelastine, 4.4, 8.8, and 17.6 mg, administered double blind and in random order. On 2 additional days, patients underwent methacholine challenge tests after placebo or azelastine, 17.6 mg. Baseline FEV1 between treatment days and 4 hours after placebo and azelastine did not change significantly. The three doses of azelastine, 4.4, 8.8, and 17.6 mg, increased the concentration of histamine required to cause a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) from 0.16 mg/ml geometric mean (GM) after placebo to 1.98 (p less than 0.01), 8.8 (p less than 0.01), and 8.1 (p less than 0.01) mg/ml, respectively. GM potency ratios derived from the PC20 values obtained for each patient indicated that the three increasing doses of azelastine displaced the histamine dose-response curve to the right by factors of 12.8, 54.4, and 50.2. Azelastine had no effect on the airway response to methacholine with GM PC20 values of 0.16 and 0.19 after placebo and azelastine, 17.6 mg. Azelastine is a potent H1 histamine-receptor antagonist on human airways in vivo without demonstrable anticholinergic effect.\r"

Societal relaxation about discussion of sex, death, homosexuality, drugs, and abortion is essential to prevent further deaths. Careful partner selection, use of condoms in conjunction with nonoxynol-9 (a viricidal spermicide), and selected confidential HIV antibody testing could help decrease the number of infected persons. Efforts directed toward IV drug users to decrease initiation of drugs, make drug treatment more accessible, provide simple techniques for cleaning needles such as a quick rinsing with bleach and water, and emphasizing the risks of sharing needles could decrease the exponential rise of HIV infection in IV drug users. A substantial percentage of women infected with both HIV and hepatitis B are unaware of their infection. Information, counseling, and antibody testing of men and women prenatally with informed options could reduce infection in children. Health care providers must work through their own valid issues of fear and possible discomfort with various lifestyles to function effectively in the health professions.\r"

We believe there are three primary goals for future research into primary HIV infection: to further define the features of this phase of infection, to develop early intervention strategies effective against HIV, and to further develop and foster education strategies that will prevent primary HIV infection.\r"

Because of the frequency of P. carinii pneumonia and because it is readily treatable, prompt, accurate, and efficient diagnostic schemes are of extreme importance. The clinical presentation is generally characterized by fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath. Such symptoms in a patient from a recognized HIV transmission category should prompt a diagnostic evaluation to identify P. carinii or other opportunistic infections. A chest radiograph usually provides an objective indication of lung disease. Pulmonary function tests, particularly the DLCO and lung imaging using 67Ga-citrate, are useful screening tests in patients with normal chest films. Examination of sputum induced by inhalation of a mist of hypertonic saline is a very useful means of identifying P. carinii. Bronchoalveolar lavage is nearly 100 per cent sensitive to the presence of P. carinii and should be performed in patients who have a nondiagnostic sputum examination. Transbronchial biopsy increases the overall yield for diagnoses other than P. carinii and should be performed in patients in whom bronchoalveolar lavage does not provide a diagnosis. Because of the effectiveness of sputum examinations and bronchoscopic procedures, open lung biopsy is rarely necessary. Measurements of circulating P. carinii antigen and antibodies are of no help in diagnosis.\r"

Adverse reactions are frequent with both agents, but because the adverse reactions are less severe with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, this agent is the drug of choice for patients who are not known to be intolerant of it. The recommended duration of therapy is 21 days. Aerosolized pentamidine and intravenous trimetrexate are investigational agents that show considerable promise, but their role in the therapy of pneumocystis pneumonia will have to be demonstrated in controlled trials. For patients who fail to respond to conventional agents after 5 to 10 days of therapy, therapeutic alternatives to consider would be trimetrexate, DFMO, or high-dose corticosteroids, the latter given with conventional agents. Prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia is appropriate for HIV-infected patients with fewer than 300 T4 lymphocytes per cu mm, even if they are receiving zidovudine (Retrovir). It also should be considered in patients with a prior history of this infection, irrespective of the T4 count. The efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, or aerosolized pentamidine has not yet been substantiated.

This complication of AIDS is almost always observed in patients who have a chronic (latent) infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Therefore, patients who from the outset of their HIV infection or AIDS are known to have antibodies to T. gondii should be considered at risk for development of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Although serologic tests cannot distinguish active from latent infection, a patient who is seronegative for Toxoplasma antibodies is unlikely to have toxoplasmic encephalitis. Neuroradiologic studies may be highly suggestive of toxoplasmic encephalitis, but, at present, the definitive diagnosis can be made only by demonstration of Toxoplasma in brain tissue. The unique pathogenesis of toxoplasmic encephalitis in patients with AIDS makes intensive primary therapy followed by a lifelong suppressive regimen necessary. We recommend 6 weeks of high doses of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (or trisulfapyrimidines) as primary therapy for the acute disease followed by daily administration of reduced doses of these drugs. The use of clindamycin as an alternative drug for primary therapy, at least at present, must be regarded as investigational and should be reserved for patients who suffer severe reactions to the sulfonamides. As most patients will respond to their primary therapy, those who fail to improve clinically and radiologically to therapy within 10 days should be evaluated for additional or alternative causes of their intracerebral pathology. This will often necessitate brain biopsy.\r"

Many cases of histoplasmosis have been reported in patients months or years after they have been in an endemic area. These are obviously cases of reactivation of latent infections. With coccidioidomycosis, the cases have been reported from endemic areas, but some also appear to be reactivation infections, and we should anticipate such cases in nonendemic areas just as with histoplasmosis. The clinical presentations may be atypical, even mimicking acute bacterial sepsis. The diagnosis should be sought in any HIV-infected patient with an unexplained infection and residence or travel in an endemic area even in the remote past. Studies should include bone marrow examinations for histoplasmosis as well as skin biopsies with special strains and cultures for fungi for both infections. Sputum or bronchoscopy specimens have often been the source of a diagnosis in coccidioidomycosis. Serologic tests for antibody in both diseases yield inconsistently positive results in AIDS patients. Treatment of the acute infection should be with amphotericin B followed by maintenance suppressive therapy with ketoconazole or Amphotericin B.\r"

Cryptococcosis is the fourth most common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and results in meningitis or pneumonia or both, in most cases. In addition, there have been unusual focal infections described and even unexplained fever alone. In any patient at risk for HIV infection, routine screening tests should include serum cryptococcal antigens, and this test should be repeated whenever new symptoms or signs appear. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment with amphotericin B is mandatory and a response should be expected. The necessity for combination therapy with flucytosine has not been documented. When the disease is under control and a course of 1 to 2 gm of amphotericin B has been administered, a maintenance suppressive regimen using amphotericin B at least weekly must be given. Oral azole regimens, such as ketoconazole or fluconazole, are under study and offer promise of a more easily managed maintenance program.\r"

Defects in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity are associated with an increased frequency of infections due to encapsulated and enteric bacteria. Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and other pathogens may occur early in the course of AIDS and have typical clinical presentations. Bacteremia is extremely common, and patients frequently fail to develop protective elevations in specific antibodies following infection. Recurrences are noted in up to one third of patients, and suppressive antimicrobial therapy may be required. The frequency of salmonellosis is increased as much as 20-fold in AIDS patients and is associated with bacteremia in more than 40 per cent of cases. Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter infections in HIV-infected individuals may precede an AIDS diagnosis, may fail to respond to appropriate therapy, or may recur after completion of treatment. Prevention of bacterial infections with antibiotics or immunotherapy, or both, is recommended for children with AIDS or ARC.\r"

They were brought to the attention of the medical community by the advent of AIDS. These parasites are associated with persistent, devastating enteritis in patients with AIDS and self-limited diarrheal illness in the immunocompetent host. Cryptosporidiosis appears to be more common than isosporiasis in both patients with AIDS and those who are not immunosuppressed. Clinically, cryptosporidiosis is indistinguishable from isosporiasis. Watery, noninflammatory diarrhea, abdominal cramping pain, and weight loss are the characteristic symptoms. Diagnosis is made by identification of the acid-fast organisms in stained fecal specimens. There is no known effective therapy for cryptosporidiosis, whereas patients with isosporiasis respond promptly to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Patients with AIDS and isosporiasis have a high frequency of recurrent infection and therefore should be maintained on suppressive therapy. Much more needs to be learned about these two fascinating and unique parasites to be able to intervene successfully in the management of infected patients with AIDS.\r"

Although the pathogenesis of AIDS-KS has not been clearly established, the clinical course and prognosis are closely related to the patient's immune status, prior history of opportunistic infection, and hematologic status. Treatment methods include local or regional radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and interferon therapy. Evaluation of the results of clinical therapeutic studies in this tumor should consider its natural history and peculiar biologic behavior and associated complications of AIDS. Effective treatment strategy would take into account the immune status of the patient, the rate of progression of tumor, the presence or risk of developing life-threatening opportunistic infections, associated hematologic or neurologic abnormalities, the toxicities of treatment, and the desire of the patient for treatment. Investigations of antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulating agents singly or in combination currently are in progress. Additionally innovative approaches with biologic response modifies, adjunctive hematopoietins, and growth factor modulators may lead to newer approaches to the control of this malignancy.\r"

Most patients present with advanced extralymphatic disease, and primary lymphoma of the central nervous system has frequently been reported. The cause of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the setting of HIV infection remains unclear. In contrast to those lymphomas observed in transplant recipients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences have been identified in a minority of AIDS-associated lymphomas. Response to therapy in these patients has been disappointing. Response rates to chemotherapy have been lower than those observed in other lymphoma patients, and treatment has been complicated by lack of adequate bone marrow reserve and the occurrence of frequent opportunistic infections. Survivals have been short. Good performance status and absence of a prior AIDS diagnosis are important predictors of response and survival. Although Hodgkin's disease has been observed in HIV-infected patients, epidemiologic data are not suggestive of a direct causal relationship. Hodgkin's disease in this setting is characterized by poor prognosis histologic pattern, advanced disease, and median survivals of less than 1 year.\r"

Of 500 sequential specimens screened for cannabinoids by enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT, 63 (13%) were initially positive and 58 (12%) were confirmed positive (92%). It was observed that geographic location and race did not correlate with cannabinoid prevalence. Cannabinoid use was observed to be strongly age related, with peak use by the 21- to 25-year-old age group where 22% of the cases were positive. Use of cannabinoids was also closely linked to homicides, which represented nearly half of the positive cases but only 13% of the total cases. When comparing manner of death, the greatest percent of confirmed positives was seen in homicide (26%) and drug-related (17%) deaths. The incidence of cannabinoid use was found to be more than 3 times as great in drug-related (17%) as compared to natural deaths (5%). The percent of cannabinoid-positive cases from vehicle-related accidents was low (6%) and that from nonvehicle-related accidents somewhat higher (10%). Other drugs appeared in cannabinoid-positive cases. Most prevalent was ethanol N = 18, followed by morphine (from heroin, N = 11), quinine N = 11, and cocaine N = 11. Phencyclidine (PCP) occurred twice and several other drugs were reported only once. Of the 25 homicide cases screened for drugs, 64% were positive for some drug including ethyl alcohol. Thus it appears that a high percentage of homicide cases are drug related. Males greatly outnumbered females (56:2) in positive cases, but the number of female specimens received was small.\r"

His \"Guide to the Identification of Human Skeletal Material\" (1939) in the F.B.I. Law Enforcement Bulletin became the foundation of this discipline; his monumental book The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine (updated with the author in 1986) solidified its establishment.

Traditionally, QL studies have investigated functional status and treatment side effects. In recent years more comprehensive instruments have been constructed to assess the QL of cancer patients. Most QL instruments take a certain degree of physical and psychological functioning into account as well as the level of activity and a global evaluation of life. The reliability and validity of these instruments are reviewed in this paper. Reliability has been well documented and seems satisfactory for most instruments. Only a few authors have discussed content validity. Predictive validity has also been established in most instances and the results from various studies are promising, however, the choice of criteria is seldom taken into account. It also seems difficult to draw conclusions about construct validity. In our view, the main problem is the lack of definitions and the absence of a theoretical framework. Therefore, some assumptions underlying QL research in cancer patients have been elucidated.\r"

Predictions based on birth weight, gestational age, or any other single variable, fail to take into account the potentially important contribution of other factors. In order to develop a practical and accurate multivariate model, we studied all singleton pregnancies resulting in viable liveborn infants who weighed less than or equal to 1500 g at birth during 1984 and 1985 at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. When gestational age, birth weight, and/or crown-heel length were considered, no maternal characteristics were significant predictors of mortality. The model with the maximal predictive accuracy (84.5%) used birth weight and 5-minute Apgar score to calculate a probability of mortality. This prognostic model was then validated in a separate cohort of singletons born in 1986. We conclude that clinical trials should require stratification before randomization, using the calculated probability of mortality, rather than birth weight or gestational age alone. Given the ability of models, such as the one presented here, to generate reasonable estimates of mortality, this information might also be used in the clinical setting to assist parents and physicians in individualized decision-making processes for a given infant.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the ability of a range of tricyclic antidepressants (TCADs) and phenothiazine derivatives and their metabolites to inhibit the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex using a [3H]MK801 binding assay. Desmethylation of the side chain of both TCADs and phenothiazines increased their potency against [3H]MK801 binding, as did removal of Cl substituted on the conjugated ring. Other side chain modifications further increased the potency of phenothiazines such as in the case of ethopropazine. Generally, the increase in potency of drugs at the NMDA receptor complex was associated with a decrease in the potency at other sites of action of these compounds. This finding suggests that it may be possible to separate the established actions of these compounds from their NMDA inhibitory effects. We also examined the mechanism of action of a number of compounds by monitoring drug effects on the dissociation rate of [3H]MK801 in the presence of Mg++. Phenothiazines and TCADs generally slow the dissociation of [3H]MK801, although to differing extents. Drugs such as 9-aminoacridine, cyproheptadine and ethopropazine also slowed the dissociation rate. These findings suggest a Zn++-like action of these compounds. In contrast, mecamylamine, methapyrilene and procyclidine had very little effect on the dissociation rate, suggesting a competitive action at the [3H]MK801/phencyclidine binding site. Chlorpromazine at low concentrations slowed the dissociation rate, while increasing it at higher concentrations. Thus, chlorpromazine demonstrated both Zn++ and Mg++-like effects. These studies demonstrate novel inhibitory actions of TCAD and phenothiazine derivatives at the NMDA receptor complex that are apparently mediated by the Zn++ binding site.\r"

There was a good correlation between the relative potency of arylcyclohexylamines as PCP-like discriminative stimuli in pigeons and these drugs as discriminative stimuli in rats. Substitution of methyl groups on the piperidine or cyclohexyl rings of PCP reduced potency, but not efficacy, whereas substitution of hydroxyl groups decreased both potency and efficacy. Replacement of the phenyl ring with a thienyl ring increased PCP-like activity, but replacement of the piperidine ring with a pyrrolidine ring or a morpholine ring decreased potency. Compounds with methyl or ethyl groups on the nitrogen atom replacing the piperidine ring also were active. These data suggest that N-alkyl substitutions decrease potency but not efficacy, whereas hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring decreases efficacy as well. The data also support the suggestion that size of the aromatic ring is also a determinant of PCP-like activity. Both optical isomers of cyclazocine and N-allylnormetazocine were active as PCP-like discriminative stimuli, although the (-)-isomer was more potent than the (+)-isomer for cyclazocine and the reverse was true for N-allylnormetazocine. The pigeon shows less stereospecific activity with these drugs than the rat and especially the squirrel monkey. A variety of other opioid-like chemical structures, as well as other drugs such as d-amphetamine and pentobarbital, were inactive as PCP-like discriminative stimuli.\r"

Inasmuch as i.c.v. administered beta-endorphin has been proposed to produce antinociception by activating a descending pain inhibitory system different from that activated by morphine, the present experiments compared the two systems in mice. The responses to i.c.v., i.t. and combinations of i.c.v. plus i.t. administration of morphine and beta-endorphin were evaluated by determination of ED50 values which were plotted as isobolograms and compared to calculated theoretical additive ED50 values. The following combinations gave additive interactions: i.c.v. plus i.t. beta-endorphin, i.c.v. beta-endorphin plus i.t. morphine and i.t. morphine plus i.t. beta-endorphin. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that i.c.v. beta-endorphin stimulates supraspinal epsilon receptors which activate a descending pathway involving enkephalinergic neuronal mediation and spinal postsynaptic mu receptors. Stimulation of these mu receptors by i.t. morphine or i.t. beta-endorphin together with the supraspinal effect of beta-endorphin resulted in an additive interaction. Multiplicative interactions were obtained for the following combinations: i.c.v. morphine plus i.t. morphine, i.c.v. morphine plus i.t. beta-endorphin and i.c.v. morphine plus i.c.v. beta-endorphin. Morphine administered i.c.v. stimulated supraspinal mu receptors to activate a descending pain inhibitory pathway which is mediated spinally by monoamines. The i.t. agonists in this case activated the spinal mu receptor which is presumed to be part of the beta-endorphin descending pathway described above. Thus, when both pathways were activated simultaneously the interaction was multiplicative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because PCP binds with high affinity to both PCP and sigma receptors, the identity of the receptor(s) mediating the immunological effects of PCP is unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the sites of PCP action (sigma and/or PCP receptors) in human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) using [3H]haloperidol or 1,3 di(2-([5-3H]tolyl)guanidine ([3H]DTG) to specifically label sigma receptors and 3,4-[3H]-(N)-[1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl]-piperidine ([3H]TCP) to specifically label PCP receptors. [3H]Haloperidol binding was saturable and of high affinity with comparable KD values in human PBL (0.44 +/- 0.10 nM) and rat cerebellum (0.51 +/- 0.09 nM). Similarly, [3H]DTG binding was saturable with comparable KD values of 29.5 +/- 3.5 and 26.4 +/- 3.6 nM in rat cerebellum and human PBL, respectively. In contrast, there was a notable absence of [3H]TCP-labeled PCP receptors in human PBL and rat cerebellum. In competition studies, the pharmacologic profile of [3H]haloperidol-labeled sigma receptors in human PBL was virtually identical with that in rat cerebellum (slope, 0.87; correlation coefficient, 0.96); the rank order of potency of competing drugs was haloperidol greater than l-butaclamol = pentazocine greater than d-3-(hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)-piperidine greater than DTG = d-butaclamol = d-SKF 10,047 greater than levallorphan greater than or equal to PCP greater than or equal to l-SKF 10,047 greater than TCP greater than MK-801.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These drugs may act: 1) by blockade of the antilipolytic alpha-2 adrenoceptor on fat cell membranes and 2) by activation of the sympathetic adrenergic system (blockade of central and presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors). Studies were undertaken in the dog, a species possessing fat cell alpha-2 and beta-adrenoceptors in order: 1) to define and compare the metabolic and endocrinological impacts of recently discovered alpha-2 antagonists [idazoxan and SK&F 86,466 (6-chloro-N-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine)] and of an older one (yohimbine) and 2) to dissociate the contribution of the noradrenergic activation from a postsynaptic action on fat cell and endocrine pancreas alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Binding studies showed that the three compounds have similar affinities for the alpha-2 adrenoceptor on both cerebrocortical and fat cell membranes. Their ability to suppress the antilipolytic effect of an alpha-2 agonist [UK-14,304 (5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline)] on isolated fat cells was equivalent. Yohimbine perfusion induced a dose-dependent increase in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and immunoreactive insulin concentrations. At equivalent doses, the three alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists induced NEFA mobilization, increase in immunoreactive insulin and norepinephrine plasma levels with an order of potency: yohimbine much greater than idazoxan greater than or equal to SK&F 86,466. The weakest effect on sympathetic activation was with SK&F 86,466. The effects of yohimbine were suppressed completely by pretreatment with propranolol. Clonidine infusion reduced NEFA levels in dogs. Yohimbine but not SK&F 86,466 abolished completely this lowering effect of clonidine on NEFA and glycerol levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89081106\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have strongly implicated the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the cascade of pathological mechanisms that cause neuronal loss after certain types of brain ischemia. The neurotoxic effects of glutamate are mediated, at least in global ischemia, via NMDA receptors. In the present study we have examined the effects of compounds that possess NMDA receptor antagonist properties (ifenprodil, SL 82.0715 [(+/-)-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]- 1-piperidineethanol] and 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine) on the histological consequences of focal, as opposed to global, cerebral ischemia in both the rat and the cat. Ifenprodil (0.3-3 mg/kg i.v.) administered as a perfusion over 3 hr after occlusion of the feline middle cerebral artery reduced the volume of infarcted tissue (measured 4 days after occlusion) in a dose-related manner. At the highest dose a 42% reduction of infarcted volume was noted, essentially in cortical tissue. In an identical protocol, a derivative of ifenprodil, SL 82.0715, reduced the volume of infarction in a manner comparable to that described for ifenprodil. As SL 82.0715 possesses better p.o. bioavailability, this compound was also evaluated in the rat, again after middle cerebral artery occlusion. First administered 30 min after the induction of ischemia, SL 82.0715 (1 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) reduced infarction volume by 34 and 48%, respectively. The quantitative histology was performed 2 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The noncompetitive receptor antagonist, 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine, administered (1 mg/kg i.p.) before the induction of focal ischemia, similarly and significantly decreased the final volume of infarction. As both ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 are noncompetitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor, two conclusions may be drawn from the present investigation. First, NMDA antagonism by ifenprodil and its derivative is an effective approach for tissue sparing in animal models of stroke and brain infarction. Second, these pharmacological observations provide evidence for the involvement of excitatory amino-acid induced-neurotoxicity in the evolution and consequences of focal cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the anti-ischemic agents ifenprodil and its derivative SL 82.0715 ((+/-)-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[(4-fluorophenyl) methyl]-1-piperidineethanol] have been analyzed in a number of models indicative of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonistic potential in vitro and in vivo. Ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 potently and noncompetitively antagonize the stimulatory effects of NMDA on cyclic GMP production in immature rat cerebellar slices (IC50 values, 0.4 and 10 microM, respectively), as well as the NMDA-evoked [3H]acetylcholine release in adult rat striatal slices (IC50 values, 1.6 and 6.6 microM, respectively). Ifenprodil is 10 times more potent than (+/-)3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) but less active than the reference noncompetitive NMDA channel blockers [MK 801, ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine ], phencyclidine and 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP)] in these models. Ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 partially displace (maximal displacement 40-50% at 10 microM) the NMDA receptor ligand [3H]CPP from its binding site to rat brain membranes (IC50 values, 0.1 and 0.3 microM, respectively) in a noncompetitive manner; in the micromolar range the two agents also partially displace the NMDA channel ligand [3H]TCP from its binding site to rat brain membranes, and noncompetitively antagonize the L-glutamate-induced increase in [3H]TCP binding. Ifenprodil (0.01-1 microM) partially antagonizes the depolarizing effects of NMDA on the immature rat hemisected spinal cord in vitro. In mouse cultured spinal cord neurons, ifenprodil dose-dependently antagonizes the depolarizing effects of micropressure applied NMDA. Inhibition of the effects of NMDA in this model by ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 is noncompetitive. In vivo and after systemic i.p. administration, ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 antagonize the stimulatory effects of intrastriatally dialyzed NMDA on striatal dopamine release in rats (ID50 values, 0.9 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively), and block the harmaline-evoked increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP production in mice (ID50 values, 3 and 4 mg/kg, respectively). These results indicate that ifenprodil is a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist which has a mechanism of action distinct from either the reference competitive NMDA receptor antagonists (CPP and 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate) or the noncompetitive NMDA channel blockers (phencyclidine, TCP and MK 801). The potent NMDA antagonistic effects of the ifenprodil class of compounds are likely to be related to the demonstrated anti-ischemic potential of these compounds.\r"

  ".W": "The 339 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and controls used in 1982 to develop the current ARA rules for classifying this disease were further analyzed using recursive partitioning methodology. The method identified 9 subgroups of cases and controls. It allowed correct classification of 97% of cases and 95% of controls while using only 6 criteria instead of 11. Antibodies to DNA were found to be the overall best discriminator. The largest subgroup (116 cases/4 controls) was made up of patients with both anti-DNA and fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA). Presence of malar rash was helpful in distinguishing SLE cases among patients who were anti-DNA negative. Low and high FANA values, in combination with other variables, helped to identify 3 SLE subgroups. Unlike the 1982 criteria, which did not include serum complement, the classification tree also identified subgroups of patients in which complement was either the best or the 2nd best discriminator. Recursive partitioning methodology thus gives important insights into how the criteria interact and the relative importance of specific variables for classification purposes.\r"

The patients had had debilitating fatigue for an average of 6.8 years, accompanied by persisting antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus early antigens (titers greater than or equal to 1:40) or undetectable levels of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens (titers less than 1:2) or both. Each course of treatment consisted of intravenous placebo or acyclovir (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) administered every eight hours for seven days. The same drug was then given orally for 30 days (acyclovir, 800 mg four times daily). There were six-week observation periods before, between, and after the treatments. Three patients had acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity and were withdrawn from the study. Of the 24 patients who completed the trial, similar numbers improved with acyclovir therapy and with placebo (11 and 10, respectively). Neither acyclovir treatment nor clinical improvement correlated with alterations in laboratory findings, including titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr virus or levels of circulating immune complexes or of leukocyte 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase. Subjective improvement correlated with various measures of mood. We conclude that acyclovir, as used in this study, does not ameliorate the chronic fatigue syndrome. We believe that the clinical improvement observed in most patients reflected either spontaneous remission of the syndrome or a placebo effect.\r"

A major problem in designing synthetic peptide vaccines is that T cells generally recognize peptide antigens only in association with one or a few of the many variants of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. During the characterization of epitopes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that are recognized by human T cells, we analysed a sequence of the circumsporozoite protein, and found that synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence are recognized by T cells in association with many different MHC class II molecules, both in mouse and in man. This region of the circumsporozoite protein is invariant in different parasite isolates. Peptides derived from this region should be capable of inducing T-cell responses in individuals of most HLA-DR types, and may represent good candidates for inclusion in an effective anti-malaria peptide vaccine.\r"

Six years before this terminal illness he had undergone total parathyroidectomy for osteitis fibrosa associated with ruptured tendons.

However, immune responses to the virus are complex and more accurately reflect an immunofocusing of host defensive capabilities: non-virus-specific responses are depressed or actively suppressed, while virus-specific systemic, local, and recruited responses develop. The result is commonly a resolution of infection without significant residual disease and with emergence of homotypic immunity. The overall combination of depressed alternate responses and enhanced antiviral immune responses might be assumed to have net defensive value for the host challenged by influenza virus.\r"

Diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds, but integration of data from computed tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis permits accurate diagnosis of most cases. Therapy for neurocysticercosis is also varied and must be individualized according to the activity of the disease and location of cysticerci. In this paper, the experience of the authors with neurocysticercosis is summarized and current information on several controversial aspects of this disease is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of O2 reduction products by human neutrophils is critical to their elimination of potential pathogens. Hydroxyl radical is a potent oxidizing agent that may be formed by neutrophils through the iron-catalyzed reaction of superoxide and its dismutation product, hydrogen peroxide. Although indirect evidence has implicated hydroxyl radical in a variety of neutrophil-mediated processes, recent studies have not demonstrated hydroxyl radical formation by neutrophils unless an exogenous iron source and chelator were available, and even then neutrophils appear to limit formation of hydroxyl radical. By consuming hydrogen peroxide, the release of myeloperoxidase limits the magnitude of hydroxyl radical production. Lactoferrin released during neutrophil stimulation binds iron in a form incapable of catalyzing hydroxyl radical generation, thereby limiting both the magnitude and the duration of hydroxyl radical formation. Hydroxyl radical resulting from neutrophil superoxide production is likely to occur either in vitro or in vivo only when the target cell (or microenvironment) provides iron in an oxidation state and form capable of catalyzing the formation of hydroxyl radical and when neutrophil prevention systems are overwhelmed.\r"

A new form of amphotericin B delivery, which utilizes liposome vesicles, is currently under investigation. Preliminary evidence suggests that liposome-encapsulated amphotericin B has a wider therapeutic index than free amphotericin B and allows for the use of larger total doses. The mechanism of reduced toxicity and enhanced activity may be associated with a liposome donor effect, an erythrocyte protective effect, and a liposome-targeting ability. Liposome-encapsulated amphotericin B tends to be entrapped or taken up by organs rich in reticuloendothelial cells--a particular advantage since disseminated fungal infections localize in these areas. This liposome-encapsulated preparation appears to represent a promising new form of antifungal therapy that may reduce the dose-limiting toxicities of amphotericin B and improve treatment response.\r"

Multiple factors appear to be involved in the development of these infections, including foreign body-associated tissue damage, impairment of host defenses, bacterial trapping by fibrin, sequestration of bacteria in implant interstices, and the generation of a biofilm on implant surfaces. Although there is a direct association between the tissue reactivity of implants and their ability to potentiate infection, bacterial slime production and adherence to implant surfaces (generation of the biofilm) appear to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of device infections, contemporary prosthetic devices generally being quite nonreactive with respect to host tissues. While virtually any organism can cause these infections, gram-positive bacteria, especially staphylococci, predominate. Infections due to gram-negative organisms and fungi, however, tend to be more serious, often requiring prompt removal of the implant.\r"

In such observational studies, the characteristics of study patients may vary widely even within a single hospital. In these investigations, extraneous variables such as differing severity of underlying illness, acting in concert with the exposure variable being studied, may distort the apparent effect of the exposure on the outcome through confounding or may modify the effect of the exposure on the outcome without distorting the relation between them. The data from six published studies are reanalyzed through the use of stratification by severity of underlying illness in order to demonstrate the impact of confounding and effect modification by a third, extraneous variable. Simple methods for dealing with confounding and effect modification in data from hospital epidemiology are presented.\r"

Humans are infected primarily in the central nervous system after ingesting an infected intermediate host. Damage by motile worms, inflammatory responses to foreign bodies, and possible toxicity of worm substances work in concert to produce the pathologic and clinical picture of neurologic angiostrongyliasis. This disease manifests itself by headache, paresthesias, generalized weakness, and occasionally visual disturbances and extraocular muscular paralysis. Eosinophilic pleocytosis is the major laboratory finding. Although the diagnosis of neurologic angiostrongyliasis is usually made clinically, serologic methods such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can be helpful. Occasionally, living larvae can be identified histologically in the CSF, eye, or other tissue. There is no specific treatment for this disease. Corticosteroids may be useful to relieve increased intracranial pressure. The role of anthelmintic drugs, such as thiabendazole and ivermectin, is not yet known. The prognosis of neurologic angiostrongyliasis is usually good; however, fatal and chronic cases do occur. Appropriate preparation of food, control of mollusks and planarians, and elimination of rodents are important measures in limiting the further spread of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis.\r"

A greater variety of organisms were isolated from patients with recurrent endocarditis than from those with primary endocarditis. Valvular involvement was evenly distributed among the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves for both primary and recurrent episodes of infection. While complications of recurrent native-valve endocarditis were relatively common, the mortality rate associated with the recurrences was less than 30%.\r"

Thirteen cases of disseminated infection due to Fusarium species have been reported, all but one of which were fatal. Hematologic malignancy is the commonest underlying illness. The frequent occurrence of multiple skin lesions, orbitofacial involvement, and fungemia is in contrast to the otherwise similar disseminated aspergillosis or mucormycosis. Fungemia in disseminated fusariosis may reflect a capacity for invasion of intravascular catheters by Fusarium species. Fusarium isolates from disseminated infections are variably sensitive to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and miconazole and uniformly resistant to 5-fluorocytosine. The correlation between antifungal susceptibility status and clinical outcome is poor, reflecting problems in susceptibility testing, marginally effective chemotherapy, and serious impairment of host defenses. Attention to early diagnosis and the care of indwelling prosthetic devices may enhance survival until more effective chemotherapy is available.\r"

Two patients had diabetes mellitus, one had diabetes mellitus and disseminated adrenocortical carcinoma, and one had a myeloproliferative disorder. The mode of acquisition was presumed to be inoculation with contaminated plant material, but a history consistent with an inoculation injury was obtained in only four patients and a retained splinter was found in the lesion of only one patient. Infection with P. richardsiae was not associated with systemic symptoms or signs. Six patients presented with a single subcutaneous cystic granulomatous lesion. One patient had chronic dacryocystitis. More extensive or invasive disease occurred in two patients, both with an ultimately fatal underlying neoplastic process. A specific etiologic diagnosis was made by culture of purulent material obtained by excisional biopsy in six patients, incision and drainage in one patient, aspiration in one, and spontaneous drainage in one. Subcutaneous nodules were cured with surgical excision. There is insufficient information concerning antifungal therapy to recommend its use.\r"

  ".W": "Mongooses are indigenous to Africa and Asia and have been introduced elsewhere. In Cuba, Puerto Rico, Grenada, and South Africa they are the major reservoir and vector of rabies. Elsewhere, sporadic cases of mongoose rabies are reported, but dog rabies can mask their importance. Population density probably determines the importance of the mongoose as a reservoir of rabies. In Grenada during a 4-year period, nearly 30% (and in some areas greater than 50%) of mongooses were found to have rabies serum neutralizing antibodies. The annual proportions of mongooses that were serum antibody-positive and virus-positive, respectively, were inversely related. Natural immunity in mongooses probably lasts for life. In contrast with foxes, in mongooses immunity is an important factor in the epizootiology of rabies. Inoculation of mongooses with Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) vaccine induced a good immunologic response and augurs well for the success of vaccination in the field. The effects of wildlife vaccination on animal populations with high levels of natural immunity need to be investigated before costly campaigns are started.\r"

Also described are studies of methods of reducing vampire bat populations. Anticoagulants such as diphenadione and warfarin were shown to be effective in reducing vampire bat populations. These substances were used in different ways: application of the compound to the skin of captured vampires and then the release of the animals to contaminate the rest of the colony; treatment of vampire niches; topical treatment of vampire bites; and systemic treatment of cattle by administration of the anticoagulant intraruminally or intramuscularly. All these methods were shown to be effective and can be used to reduce vampire populations and to decrease the risk of transmission of rabies in enzootic areas.\r"

  ".W": "Ten geographic cells of rabies cases were identified within southern Ontario. Some had regular 3-year peaks, whereas others had weak cycles with mean periods of up to 9 years. Incidence of rabies was related to soil types (highest on sandy and clay loams), land use (abundant where hay and pasture were dominant), and drainage (poor drainage supported only low levels of rabies). A spatial stochastic simulation model is being used to evaluate risks and tactics associated with reduction of rabies by use of vaccine baits. The model indicated that persistence of rabies is unlikely in areas with less than 4,000 km2 of contiguous fox habitat. In sensitivity tests the model was most affected by the values of four input parameters: rate of contact among foxes, incubation period of rabies, fox density, and a density-dependent feedback that reduces fox recruitment when density approaches or exceeds a predetermined \"carrying capacity.\" In a majority of model experiments, a single vaccination of 60% of a fox population eradicated rabies, but only if vaccination took place just after a rabies outbreak, when the number of both foxes and rabid animals was reduced. Rabies control will probably be applied to individual cells or clusters of cells rather than to the entire 98,000 km2 enzootic zone, at least at first. If rabies is eradicated the fox populations may increase, but modestly. Skunks were more important than foxes as vectors of rabies in urban Ontario. Since there is no effective oral rabies vaccine for skunks, skunks were trapped alive and vaccinated by injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dog populations, like other populations, depend on the availability of resources (food, water, and shelter). Humans either make available or deliberately withhold resources for varying proportions of dog populations. Dog-keeping practices and the duties of responsible ownership vary with the cultural setting. Dog populations often attain densities that allow the species to be a main host of rabies. The epidemiology of dog rabies is not well understood, despite the easy access to dog populations. Today dog rabies is predominant in developing countries. In addition to the high rate of exposure of humans to dogs, traditional medical beliefs and practices are the most important cultural factors that lead to high numbers of cases of human rabies. Dog rabies control programs have been successful in the past, but most are failing today. Program development should follow managerial principles and take into consideration the biology of dog populations as well as cultural constraints. Elimination of stray dogs is not an efficient means of controlling either the dog population or rabies, but it may create public awareness.\r"

  ".W": "Human rabies is underreported, but it clearly is still a frequent medical problem that is virtually confined to tropical countries. Rabies encephalitis remains essentially incurable, and most patients die at home, their terrible symptoms unpalliated by sedatives or analgesics. Recent attempts to cure rabies in well-equipped intensive care units have failed, a situation reemphasizing the importance of preventive measures. The great advances that have been made in understanding the rabies virus and the associated improvements in rabies vaccines have had little or no impact in the tropical endemic zone. Most patients who have been exposed to rabies are still given nervous tissue vaccines for postexposure prophylaxis. An urgent priority is the development of a regimen using tissue culture vaccine that is sufficiently economical to replace nervous tissue vaccine. This has been achieved in China with primary hamster kidney cell vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "The neuromuscular junction represents a site of transit for both fixed and street rabies viruses. Infection of cultured rat myotubes by fixed rabies virus was found to be restrictive, and although fluorescence observations showed that cells were infected, there were no infectious virus particles in the supernatant of infected myotubes. In contrast, infection of myotubes with street rabies virus produced infectious virus particles, and kinetic studies noted a growth cycle in these cells. Neurons derived from the rat spinal cord or from dorsal root ganglia were 10-100-fold more susceptible to infection with fixed rabies challenge virus strain (CVS) than were the myotubes, a finding that confirms the basically neurotropic nature of rabies virus. The abortive infection of CVS rabies in muscle cells may be one possible mechanism by which virus persists at the site of inoculation. In addition, competition-binding experiments show that alpha-bungarotoxin at 10(-5)-10(-7) M inhibits rabies virus infection of myotubes, a finding that suggests the involvement of low-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors for rabies virus. Sialic acid was shown to be necessary for the attachment of rabies virus to the myotubes, a requirement confirming earlier data for other cell types. These data confirm observations in vivo. Infection of these cells in primary culture, which represent the natural target for rabies virus, mimics the situation in vivo. Such a model permits further investigation of virus-cell interactions at the neuromuscular junction.\r"

To relate the immune response and efficacy of treatment to the situation in humans, however, it is necessary to corroborate the results in rodents with those in subhuman primates. Methods effective and safe in subhuman primates may be considered for use in humans.\r"

Officially recommended programs comprise either two doses administered on days 0 and 28 or three doses given on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. A first booster 1 year later ensures a good duration of immunity; follow-up studies now cover 5-8 years. These results were obtained by the intramuscular and subcutaneous injection routes; intradermal programs have been explored with the aim of reducing costs. Preexposure immunization is well tolerated, despite some systemic allergic reactions. Efficacy has been observed universally, but certain factors may affect results. Several lines of evidence favor an extension of preexposure vaccination. In Scandinavian countries, the majority of vaccine doses are used preexposure, while about 40%, 15%, and 10% are so used in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, respectively. However, preventive immunization is rare in developing countries, where the risk of infection is maximal and permanent. The more economical new vaccines, such as purified Vero rabies vaccine, permit a reevaluation of preventive vaccination. Vaccine combinations including rabies may prove economical.\r"

The prevalent vaccine is still the nerve-tissue vaccine, which, although improved, necessitates the use of long and painful application schedules and fails to provide safe and reaction-free protection. A new generation of low-cost, purified rabies vaccines released in the last 2 years promises a revolution in rabies immunization in less-developed, rabies endemic countries, providing protection comparable to that of human diploid cell vaccine at the cost of Semple-type vaccine. Devising an appropriate technology for human rabies immunization includes new regimens of administration, one of which, a revised intramuscular regimen requiring only four doses and three clinic visits, proved highly efficient for postexposure treatment.\r"

Several unique features of rabies viruses have been deduced from the complete nucleotide sequences of four of the five genes and the four intergenic regions of the genome. The most extensively analyzed rabies virus gene has been that of the surface glycoprotein. Direct comparisons between the deduced amino acid sequences of glycoprotein variants have led to the location of specific sites on the glycoprotein that bind virus-neutralizing antibodies and to the identification of an epitope correlating with viral pathogenicity. Structural requirements for immunogenic activity within the glycoprotein have also been investigated. This article presents an overview of the molecular biology of rabies viruses and describes the current state of knowledge of immunobiologic characteristics of different rabies virus components.\r"

A one-to-one correlation was found in 50% of the patients; five patients were predicted to have stayed the same or decreased by ISIS and showed increase on x-ray measurement. Eight patients were predicted to have stayed the same or decreased by x-ray measurement and showed increase by ISIS. Although a weak positive correlation exists between change by x-ray examination and change by ISIS examination in a braced population, the clinical usefulness of the ISIS method in following a braced population has not been proven.\r"
