  ".W": "The current redistribution of resources in the National Health Service will require a reduction in the number of acute beds in many district health authorities. The effect of such a reduction on services for patients was examined. Two hundred and two general medical admissions and 201 general surgical admissions to hospitals in West Lambeth District Health Authority were reviewed retrospectively. The elements considered were the severity of the patient's illness at admission, the scope for reducing the length of stay, the potential for other forms of care, and what types of patients would be denied access at different levels of reductions in the number of beds. Given the assumptions a considerable potential for maintaining levels of service with fewer beds was identified. The finding was, however, that even if all of this potential was realised the cuts in the number of beds that are planned by districts that are losing resources would force real reductions in patient services. This suggests a \"trade off.\" To increase services in districts that are gaining resources, real unmet need may have to be created in districts that are losing resources.\r"

An adolescent boy who sniffed trichloroethane presented with multiple ventricular arrhythmias during tonsillectomy. Follow up showed mild chronic left ventricular impairment. A 54 year old man had repeated industrial exposure to trichloroethane and deteriorated from mild stable cardiac failure to end stage cardiac failure after halothane anaesthesia for herniorrhaphy. Chronic cardiac toxicity is a previously unreported feature of this type of solvent exposure. Related compounds such as halothane may have a toxic interaction after exposure to trichloroethane.\r"

After heating the plasma an endogenous substance cross reacting with antibodies to digoxin was identified in 18 cases. The presence of this substance was significantly related to the total amount of blood and to the presence of blood in the frontal interhemispheric fissure and could not be explained by hypertension or intake of water and sodium. A negative sodium balance and volume depletion occurred more often in patients who were positive for digoxin, but this relation did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that a digoxin-like natriuretic factor is released in response to a subarachnoid haemorrhage, probably as a result of hypothalamic damage.\r"

After an average follow up of 6.2 years 335 of the 7729 men had experienced a myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal) or sudden cardiac death. No significant relation was found between reported alcohol intake and the incidence of such events. Though the group of light daily drinkers had the lowest incidence of ischaemic heart disease events, it also contained the lowest proportion of current smokers, had the lowest mean blood pressure, had the lowest mean body mass index, and contained the lowest proportion of manual workers. These characteristics are more likely to account for the apparent protective effect of alcohol against ischaemic heart disease than a direct effect of alcohol. Compared with the effects of established risk factors alcohol seems to be quite unimportant in the development of ischaemic heart disease.\r"

This was attributed in part to higher susceptibility to rubella in Asian than non-Asian women, as shown by antenatal serological data from public health laboratories in Leeds, Luton, and Manchester. Examination of the ethnic origin of pregnant women requesting laboratory testing after contact with rubella or rash and of women with laboratory confirmed rubella in pregnancy also suggested that the disease was being underdiagnosed in pregnant Asian women. Failure to prevent congenital rubella by termination of infected pregnancies may therefore contribute to the increased incidence of the syndrome in Asians. Health education programmes about the dangers of rubella in pregnancy and of the need for vaccination can readily be promoted in the Asian community through existing ethnic organisations. Protection of other ethnic minorities likely to be at similar increased risk may require a vaccination programme aimed at national elimination of rubella.\r"

Ten mothers and four neonates required transfer during the early puerperium, all to one receiving unit in Carlisle. There were six perinatal deaths during the five years; five occurred in babies delivered after transfer. The perinatal mortality was 4.7/1000. The low mortality, the low level of intervention, and the preference of women all support the retention of isolated units.\r"

It appeared that the infants in hospital received phototherapy seven times more often than those at home, and surveillance at home was not inferior to that in hospital. There is no reason to assume that neonatal jaundice occurred more often in neonates in hospital than in those at home. Thus the difference in the frequency of treatment with phototherapy between the two groups is ascribed to the influence of the hospital environment, which may encourage intervention.\r"

In three neighbouring towns in northern England the rates of death from all causes differ greatly. Socioeconomic conditions in the towns are similar though below average for England and Wales. The pattern of disease specific rates was analysed and related to past differences in infant mortality. It is suggested that past differences in maternal health and physique and in the postnatal environment, particularly infant feeding, housing, and overcrowding, may be determinants of current differences in adult mortality.\r"

Eight normotensive insulin dependent diabetics with microalbuminuria who had overnight albumin excretion rates of between 15 and 200 micrograms/min underwent a three week randomised crossover study of their normal protein diet (median 92 (range 55-117) g/day) and a low protein diet (47 (38-57) g/day). Both diets were isoenergetic, and the low protein diet was supplemented with calcium and phosphate. Median overnight albumin excretion rate fell from 23.0 (15.0-170.1) micrograms/min during the normal diet to 15.4 (4.1-97.8) micrograms/min during the low protein diet. No consistent change was found in urinary excretion of beta 2 microglobulin during the two diets. The reduction in albumin excretion rate was accompanied by a significant fall in median glomerular filtration rate and fractional renal clearance of albumin. Kidney volume remained unchanged. There were no significant changes in glycaemic control or arterial blood pressure. In these few patients restriction of dietary protein had a beneficial effect on microalbuminuria, independent of changes in glucose concentrations and arterial blood pressure.\r"

  ".U": "87186259\r", 
  ".W": "It is unknown whether replacement doses of cortisone acetate and the absence of the small amounts of androgens secreted by the adrenal cortex may cause osteoporosis. This was studied in 35 patients (12 men and 23 women) suffering from primary adrenocortical failure and taking cortisone acetate 25-37.5 mg and fludrocortisone 50-100 micrograms daily. Bone mineral density was measured by single photon absorptiometry at the midshaft of the radius, representing cortical bone, and at the distal part of the radius, a site with a significant trabecular component. The bone mineral density was normal in premenopausal female patients as well as in male patients, showing that replacement doses of cortisone acetate do not affect bone mass. By contrast, in postmenopausal patients there was a dramatic bone loss in addition to the physiological postmenopausal decrease in bone mass. This loss, combined with the low plasma concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and testosterone (and low concentrations of oestrone of adrenal origin), indicates that adrenal androgens may be essential for the maintenance of bone mass in postmenopausal women with Addison's disease. In addition, these data indicate that the small amounts of androgens secreted by the adrenal cortex have a role in the maintenance of bone mass in normal postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the influence of thyroxine treatment on thyroid volume after thyroidectomy for non-toxic goitre 110 consecutive patients were randomised to receive thyroxine (150 micrograms daily) or no treatment three months after operation. Thyroid volume determined by ultrasonography did not differ significantly between the two groups one year after operation. Nevertheless, a similar decrease in volume was seen from three to 12 months postoperatively in the thyroxine treated and no treatment groups (median 18 (range 8-70) ml to 16 (range 7-57) ml, and median 20 (range 9-72) ml to 17 (range 8-58) ml, respectively). Three patients (two given thyroxine) had recurrence of goitre within the observation period of one year. In this series thyroid volume decreased during the first postoperative year independently of thyroxine treatment. Hence it seems questionable whether postoperative thyroid function studies can identify patients at risk of recurrence of goitre after operation for non-toxic goitre and whether routine postoperative treatment with thyroxine is justifiable.\r"

Eighty eight (14.3%) of the women born in 1950 and 41 (7.7%) of those born in 1935 were childless. Sixty eight women born in 1950 (11.0%) and 17 born in 1935 (3.2%) were considered childless by choice. Involuntary childlessness was found in 20 (3.3%) of the women born in 1950 and 24 (4.5%) born in 1935. Forty two (6.8%) of the women born in 1950 had consulted a specialist about infertility as compared with 19 (3.6%) born in 1935. This study found a significant increase in voluntary childlessness among the younger women; there was no evidence of a change in the prevalence of involuntary childlessness despite the increasing demand for specialist referral, which appeared to be made by women who were parous or destined to become so.\r"

Two months later the same general practitioners received a written simulation about a patient who had the same urinary tract infection and were asked how they would handle this in real practice. Both results were scored against an existing consensus standard. The overall score for both methods did not show any substantial differences. A more differentiated analysis, however, showed that general practitioners performed significantly better with simulated patients. It also showed that general practitioners answering the written simulation performed significantly more unnecessary and superfluous actions. The results of this study show that the use of simulated patients seems to show the efficient performance of general practitioners in practice.\r"

  ".U": "87186290\r", 
  ".W": "Of 208 young women with insulin dependent diabetes, 15 (7%) had a clinically apparent eating disorder (anorexia nervosa or bulimia), a much higher prevalence than reported in non-diabetic women. Most, but not all, of these patients had a long history of poor glycaemic control. In contrast with previous suggestions, control did not deteriorate after the onset of the eating disorder. There was a high incidence and an early onset of diabetic complications. Eleven of the 15 patients had retinopathy, six with proliferative changes; six had nephropathy; and six neuropathy. Most strikingly, four patients with anorexia nervosa developed acute painful polyneuropathy. In each case pain started when the eating disorder developed, almost coinciding with the peak of weight reduction. Remission of pain occurred as weight was regained. The symptoms were accompanied by abnormalities in peripheral nerve electrophysiology and autonomic nerve function, some improvements in which accompanied weight recovery. It is suggested that nutritional factors may contribute to the high rate of early onset diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of about 7000 children, parents' perceptions were used to examine the prevalence of food intolerance, the types of food implicated, the association of intolerance with diseases, and the social background of those identified as being food intolerant. One hundred and ninety two children (3%) were perceived as being food intolerant, with a further 105 (2%) being classed as intolerant under a less stringent definition of intolerance. For 128 (67%) of these children a doctor was consulted. The pattern of food avoided was very similar in children for whom the decision to exclude certain foods was made by health staff and in those for whom the parents themselves made decisions about their child's diet. A strong association was seen between the mother's level of education and the child being perceived as being food intolerant. Between 20% and 30% of children with a disease associated with food intolerance--for example, eczema--had currently or previously avoided some types of food. The results of this study emphasise the need to develop criteria to tackle the growing demand for National Health Service treatment by parents who believe their child to be food intolerant.\r"

Eight of the 17 seropositive patients failed to develop detectable hepatitis B surface antibody within three months of the third injection compared with only one of the 18 seronegative patients (p less than 0.01). HIV infection is prevalent in the developed world in groups at risk for hepatitis B infection and in certain Third World countries where widespread vaccination programmes exist. This study shows the impact that coincident HIV infection may have on an otherwise efficacious vaccine. The efficacy of this and other vaccines in patients infected with HIV needs to be studied urgently.\r"

  ".U": "87186296\r", 
  ".W": "General practitioners' medical records of a geographically defined population of about 1600-1800 have been retained since 1964. Details of care by general practitioners and hospital correspondence were available for 500 deaths (277 men, 223 women) from 1964 to 1985, including deaths at home, at work, in the street, in short term and long term institutional care, and within six months of release from institutional care. The periods 1964-73 and 1974-85 were compared. The proportion of men aged greater than or equal to 80 who died increased from 20 (14%) in 1964-73 to 22 (16%) in 1974-85, but the proportion of women aged greater than or equal to 80 who died increased from 21 (23%) to 50 (39%). Of all deaths, 223 (45%) were thought to have had avoidable causal factors, of which 132 (59%) were attributed to patients, 45 (20%) to the general practitioner, 9 (4%) to hospitals, and 37 (17%) to others. The number of deaths related to smoking decreased from 31 (43%) in men aged less than 70 to 19 (30%) but in women aged less than 70 increased from 4 (10%) to 11 (26%). The proportion of deaths in women who were already dependent six months before death increased from 55 (58%) to 81 (63%) but in men remained constant at 64 (46%) in the first period and 62 (46%) in the second. Nearly two thirds of all deaths occurred at home in both periods--about twice the proportion for England and Wales--but the proportion of men dying at home decreased from 87 (62%) to 76 (56%). A critical analysis of deaths in whole populations by primary care teams can identify changes that are needed both in the work and organisation of the team and in the behaviour of the population itself.\r"

Data that are collected routinely, however, can be used to provide each unit with a graphical profile of its activity and resources. The method described here was derived from the personality profiles used by psychologists and allows staff in one unit to assess the outcome, activity, and use of resources in their unit in relation to similar units, to explain some of the differences when these occur, or to highlight potential problems. Examples are taken from a study of maternity units in the West Midlands. It is concluded that the technique can indicate potential problems and usefully be adopted by those who monitor maternity care in districts or hospitals.\r"

  ".W": "Of the 718 patients investigated for intractable epilepsy by stereoelectrocencephalographic (SEEG) exploration, 30 (4%) manifested gustatory hallucinations as part of their seizures. In 20 patients, it was possible to make some electrophysiological, clinical and anatomical correlates. Gustatory hallucinations occurred as one manifestation of parietal, temporal or temporoparietal seizures. A brief isolated gustatory hallucination was induced mainly by electrical stimulation of the parietal or rolandic opercula in patients with gustatory seizures, in 1 epileptic patient with parietotemporal epilepsy who had never experienced gustatory hallucinations and in another with temporal lobe epilepsy with no history of gustatory manifestations. The electrically-induced seizures, which included a gustatory hallucination as one of the ictal events, were obtained mainly by stimulation of the hippocampus and amygdala. The associated ictal events of a seizure with gustatory manifestations differed depending upon the origin of the seizure. During parietal seizures, they consisted of staring reactions, clonic contractions of the face, deviation of the eyes and salivation. During temporal lobe seizures, the associated events included mainly oral movements, autonomic disturbances, purposeless movements and epigastric or other abdominal symptoms. Seizures affecting both the infra- and suprasylvian regions were characterized by symptoms of both categories listed above. Emotional disturbances were observed mainly when there was an involvement of the cingulate gyrus. When care was taken to avoid methodological errors in the interpretation of the clinical signs occurring after electrical stimulation, it became clear that gustatory hallucinations in man were related to the disorganization of the parietal and/or rolandic operculum. electrically-induced temporal lobe seizures which included gustatory hallucinations as an ictal event probably spread to the opercular region by a functional reorganization of the connections within these epileptogenic areas.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroblastoma is the most common fatal solid tumour of childhood. Studies in Japan suggest that screening urine at 6 months for tumour-derived metabolites greatly improves early case finding and prognosis. The incidence rate of neuroblastoma in Quebec is at least 1 per 10,330 live births, higher than that of all other diseases responding to early treatment except congenital hypothyroidism screened for in the Quebec Network of Genetic Medicine. The feasibility of chemical screening of urine for elevated levels of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid in Quebec was assessed. The cost-effectiveness of screening 100,000 infants per year would be high (cost-benefit ratio 2.4), with a net saving of about $280,000 and eight lives per year. The estimated cost of adding neuroblastoma screening to the existing urine metabolite screening program is $70,700. The apparent sensitivity of the proposed test is 0.859 and the rate of false-positive results about 0.1%, both acceptable values. The attitude of potential participants toward the present urine screening program and the addition of a \"tumour test\" was positive. The results indicate that a pilot study of neuroblastoma screening in Quebec could be undertaken.\r"

The mean percentages, but not the absolute numbers, of T-lymphocytes expressing pan-T markers (OKT11, OKT3, ER, E-AET R) were significantly decreased compared with control values. Furthermore, patients showed a selective loss of OKT4+ cells, as well as increased percentages and numbers of Leu7+ and OKIa+ lymphocytes, and of OKM1+, LeuM2+, and LeuM3+ cells. OKT4+ cell depletion was a characteristic of patients with shorter time since beginning of remission as well as of those with nodular sclerosis (NS), mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease (MC-HD), and systemic symptoms at diagnosis. Multifactorial statistical analysis carried out to investigate the effect of disease characteristics and the time since remission began on peripheral mononuclear blood cell (PMBC) subsets showed that histologic condition was the single best predictor of T-cell pool or OKT4+ cell subset size. Time since remission duration and other disease-related factors determined differences in the percentages, but not in the absolute numbers, of T-cell fractions. In addition, neither the disease features nor the time since remission duration determined significant differences in the absolute number of non-T-mononuclear cells in the various patient groups. Patients displayed decreased in vitro synthesis of IL-2 and IFN gamma. The values of SCMC, Type I IFN, neopterin, B2-M, immunoglobulins, and complement fractions did not differ greatly from those of controls.\r"

A positive correlation exists between the presence of vascular invasion and lymph node metastases. Sixty-nine percent of patients with lymph node metastases had vascular invasion while only 26% of patients without lymph node metastases showed evidence of invasion of blood vessels. The finding of vascular invasion by tumor in patients without axillary lymph node metastases at the time of mastectomy may explain the occurrence of disseminated disease years after treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The basis for the reduced maximum diastolic potential of canine cardiac subendocardial Purkinje fibers surviving one day after extensive transmural infarction was investigated, using double-barrel potassium and sodium ion-sensitive microelectrodes. The maximum diastolic potential of Purkinje fibers in infarct preparations from the left ventricular apex measured during the first hour of superfusion in a tissue bath was -50.1 +/- 13.7 mV, a value markedly reduced from the value in control Purkinje fibers from noninfarcted preparations (-85.0 +/- 4.5 mV). The intracellular potassium ion activity was reduced by 50.4 mM during this time (intracellular potassium ion activity equals 61.6 +/- 16.1 mM, as compared to control intracellular potassium ion activity of 112 +/- 19.8 mM). The potassium equilibrium potential was reduced by 16.0 mV (from -97.2 +/- 4.7 mV in controls to -81.2 +/- 6.9 mV), thus accounting for about one half of the reduction in the maximum diastolic potential. After 6 hours of superfusion, the maximum diastolic potential increased to -78.9 +/- 8.7 mV (still significantly less than control). The potassium equilibrium potential had largely recovered (-93.8 +/- 5.9 mV). The intracellular sodium ion activity of Purkinje fibers in the infarcts (15.6 +/- 6.9 mM) was elevated during the first hour of superfusion by 6.2 mM compared to control (9.4 +/- 2.6 mM), and this was only 12% as much as the initial intracellular potassium ion activity decrease. Sodium ion activity after 3-6 hours of superfusion was not significantly different than normal (12.1 +/- 4.9 mM). In conclusion, only a portion of the maximum diastolic potential changes can be explained by a reduction of the potassium equilibrium potential. It is likely that change(s) in the cell membrane sodium-potassium pump's function and in the membrane conductance are also involved. Furthermore, the lack of a compensatory increase in intracellular sodium ion activity accompanying the large reduction of intracellular potassium ion activity may be a consequence of the cellular acidosis, which is known to occur during myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Purified synthetic products from the cytochrome P450 pathway of arachidonate metabolism were applied to the intestinal serosa. Arteriolar blood flow was calculated using video microscopy. After a steady-state baseline, a bolus containing 10-60 micrograms 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid/ml (14,15-EET) had no detectable effect on blood flow. However, 25 +/- 3 micrograms 11,12-EET/ml and 36 +/- 2 micrograms 8,9-EET/ml caused increases (134 +/- 8% and 127 +/- 6%) that were similar to those elicited by 8 +/- 2 micrograms adenosine/ml (138 +/- 12%). Furthermore, the increases (275 +/- 38%) produced by 32 +/- 6 micrograms 5,6-EET/ml exceeded those elicited (160 +/- 10%) by a similar concentration (27 +/- 3 micrograms/ml) of adenosine. Thus, a structure-activity relationship is suggested. Nevertheless, these values probably underestimate the potency of the EETs because the vasoactivity was reduced by contact with water. The activity of the cyclooxygenase pathway seemed to limit the formation of vasoactive quantities of EETs, or other nonprostanoids, from exogenous arachidonate in the serosa but not the mucosa. A bolus (1.3 +/- 0.2 mg/ml) or continuous application (122 +/- 45 micrograms/ml) of arachidonate caused blood flow increases (236 +/- 14% or 229 +/- 27%) that were almost eliminated (129 +/- 5% or 121 +/- 9%) by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor; the residual response was abolished by a cytochrome P450 inhibitor. However, cytochrome P450 inhibitors alone did not attenuate the arachidonate response. In contrast, a continuous application of 194 micrograms arachidonate/ml to the mucosa caused a markedly smaller blood flow increase (119 +/- 8%) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors potentiated (132 +/- 8%), rather than reduced, this response. We conclude that EETs are a labile class of vasodilators with a potency comparable to adenosine in the intestinal microcirculation. Indirect evidence suggests regional differences in the formation of vasoactive quantities of arachidonate metabolites within the intestinal wall.\r"

The peptide, extracted from several species of vertebrate heart, also has been shown to increase glomerular filtration and reduce plasma volume. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the action of the peptide but remain undefined. In the present report, the ANP-induced alterations in transcapillary water movement were directly assessed. The modified Landis technique was used to measure single capillary hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of vessels from the frog mesenteric circulation. In 6 individual microvessels, Lp was measured under control conditions and again during perfusion with 10 X 10(-6) M ANP. The Lp increased in each vessel by a mean of 3.79-fold (+/- 2.09 SD). In 4 of these vessels, an additional measurement of Lp was repeated under control conditions; the capillary filtration coefficient returned to control levels. It was concluded that ANP directly and reversibly elevates capillary hydraulic conductivity; this response is independent of changes in capillary hydrostatic pressure or surface area.\r"

One patient, assigned to receive placebo, developed acute myocardial infarction after randomization but before receiving the study drug. Ischemic events were recorded during a hospital follow-up period of at least 4 days unless a further intervention was indicated or the coronary angiogram was normal. The follow-up period was 7 +/- 5 days (mean +/- SD) after the placebo infusion and 8 +/- 4 days after the infusion of rt-PA. Unstable angina pectoris persisted after the completion of the infusion in six of 11 patients receiving placebo and only one of 12 patients receiving rt-PA (p less than .03). Coronary angiography, performed 38 +/- 19 hr after the infusion, demonstrated subocclusive thrombus in eight of 11 patients receiving placebo but in none of 11 patients treated with rt-PA (p less than .002).

Before and after the intravenous administration of 50 mg rt-PA over a 2 hr period, levels of total fibrinogen, fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP), and cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XDP) were measured in each patient. Elevated levels of XDP were found in all patients before treatment (mean 2.0 micrograms/ml, normal less than 0.2 microgram/ml), and these increased 12-fold with treatment. Fibrinogen levels fell 30% and FDP levels increased 24-fold for the entire group of patients. Over this 2 hr period, 10 of 24 patients (responders) demonstrated 25% or greater improvement in the extent of pulmonary artery thrombus as quantified by Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial score, and these patients were found to have a significantly lower XDP/FDP ratio after rt-PA (p less than .04) than those patients who failed to respond. These data suggest that the intravenous administration of pharmacologic doses of rt-PA in patients with pulmonary embolism produces both fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis, successful thrombolysis in these patients is associated with a preponderance of fibrinogenolysis over fibrinolysis, the XDP/FDP ratio is a useful indicator of fibrinolytic specificity, and in patients with acute pulmonary embolism the endogenous fibrinolytic pathways are activated, albeit ineffectively, as indicated by the increased circulating XDP levels seen in all 24 patients before the administration of rt-PA.\r"

In rabbits with t-PA injected directly into exposed muscle followed by local electrical stimulation at the site, early absorption was increased markedly by addition of 0.63M methylamine plus 0.079M hydroxylamine to the excipient. Elevations peaked within 5 min and increased with dose of t-PA, concentration of methylamine, and volume of injection medium. The enhancers were effective with percutaneous injections in the absence of local electrical stimulation as well. They did not elicit any obviously deleterious local or systemic effects. In separate experiments in rats, intramuscular injections of 0.63M methylamine plus 0.079M hydroxylamine induced local egress of intravascular radiolabeled albumin within the injection site and endothelial gaps in venules detected with colloidal carbon--changes consistent with direct effects on vascular permeability. In dogs, percutaneous intramuscular injection of t-PA in excipient without enhancers did not lead to early elevations of human t-PA in plasma, although late elevations were seen. When the enhancers were used, early elevations occurred as well, with functional activity documented by fibrin plate assays of serially obtained plasma samples and by sequential coronary angiography delineating thrombolysis after experimentally induced coronary thrombosis. The results indicate that intramuscular administration of t-PA with selected enhancers of absorption is a feasible approach for rapid induction of fibrinolysis.\r"

This model was achieved by long-term oral immunization and intravenous injection of colloidal carbon in order to achieve reticuloendothelial (RES) dysfunction. In this paper, we investigated the effects of sodium cromoglycate (SCG), an anti-allergic agent, on this model. Mice were treated with a small amount of colloidal carbon three times to block the RES, in addition to receiving oral administration of lactalbumin, as a food antigen. Open renal biopsy was performed at 18 weeks after the RES blockade, and mice were divided into 2 groups. One group received orally administered SCG and lactalbumin [SCG(+)], and the other group received lactalbumin only [SCG(-)] from 19 to 30 weeks. At 30 weeks, all mice were sacrificed for histopathological observation of renal tissue and blood sampling. IgA nephropathy had developed in all mice of the SCG(-) group, but had not developed in 7 out of the 9 mice in the SCG(+) group, at 30 weeks. Serum IgA levels obtained on sacrifice were significantly higher in the SCG(-) group. It was concluded that SCG effectively inhibited, not only the onset, but also the progression of IgA nephropathy in our original model. The effective mechanisms of this drug may act to suppress the local immunity produced through sensitization of gastrointestinal mucosa by food antigens.\r"

Fingertip blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography and capillary flow (CF) by the disappearance rate of a local injection of radioisotope. Small doses of nitroprusside (1 to 2 micrograms/min) increased FBF in fingers vasoconstricted by intra-arterial norepinephrine (4.7 +/- SE 1.7 to 38.4 +/- 26 ml min-1 100 ml-1 of tissue). Large doses of nitroprusside (up to 40 micrograms/min) did not increase FBF (11.8 +/- 6.0 ml to 6.6 +/- 3.9 ml) in fingers vasoconstricted by sympathetic nerve stimulation (body cooling). Forearm blood flow was measured in six subjects in the cool room and all showed an increase in flow with nitroprusside (6.7 +/- 1.1 ml to 26.0 +/- 6.0 ml), demonstrating that effective doses were used. Nitroglycerin (2.5 to 5 micrograms/min) significantly increased FBF from 5.1 +/- 1.9 ml to 14.8 +/- 6.9 ml as did phentolamine (50 to 100 micrograms/min) from 6.7 +/- 2.8 ml to 36.0 +/- 11.3 ml in sympathetically vasoconstricted subjects. Only phentolamine increased CF significantly (0.8 +/- 0.2 ml to 2.8 +/- 0.6 ml). Nitroprusside is an effective vasodilator for humorally induced vasoconstriction, but sympathetic digital vasoconstriction is resistant to nitroprusside and nitroglycerin is less effective than phentolamine. Phentolamine is the preferred agent because it increased FBF and CF.\r"

While treatment of ventricular arrhythmias is completely justifiable for patients with symptoms, their use to prevent sudden cardiac death has not yet been established. Because of their potential risks, the benefit/risk ratio must always be kept in mind. If we elect to treat patients who have benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias (usually to eliminate refractory symptoms) we typically begin with either a beta blocker or one of the new potent class IC antiarrhythmic agents such as flecainide or encainide. These drugs cause few side effects, no organ toxicity, and in the case of encainide or flecainide, have marked potency. Few important proarrhythmic effects are seen with these potent drugs in this group of patients. If these fail, one can try either a class IA or IB agent or a combination of a IA and IB agent. We always avoid amiodarone. In patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, one should choose a drug without negative inotropic potential such as quinidine or encainide as initial therapy. The combination of IA and IB agents should also be considered early in therapy. In patients with overt congestive heart failure with markedly depressed left ventricular function in the setting of lethal arrhythmias, disopyramide, beta blockers, and flecainide should be avoided. Amiodarone is used in this population only when the other available agents have proven to be ineffective or badly tolerated.\r"

The majority of patients were volume-expanded. Samples were drawn from the superior vena cava, right atrium, pulmonary artery, and radial artery. All alpha-ANP levels were significantly depressed by 15 cm H2O PEEP for one hour, when compared to CMV without PEEP. During the PEEP period, cardiac index, creatinine clearance, urinary flow and urinary sodium excretion were decreased. CMV with PEEP of 20 cm H2O depressed peripheral venous plasma levels of alpha-ANP in six volume-expanded healthy volunteers, too. The decreased release of alpha-ANP could be a consequence of atrial compression by the distended lungs and of reduced venous return. We suggest that the decline in plasma alpha-ANP levels contributes to fluid retention and renal dysfunction, which occur frequently during CMV with PEEP. More detailed studies are necessary to confirm our hypothesis.\r"

The PiaO2 values were measured using a bipolar oxygen sensor placed through an 18-ga arterial catheter. The PtcO2 values were measured using a transcutaneous O2-CO2 sensor placed on the abdomen. Seven critically ill, hemodynamically stable, ventilator-dependent adult patients were studied. Measurements were obtained at varying concentrations (0.25 to 1.0) of inspired oxygen after a 10-min stabilization. A total of 78 simultaneous values were obtained; by linear regression: PiaO2 = 0.91 PaO2 + 1.39 (r = .98, standard errors of the estimate [SEE] = 18.6); PtcO2 = 0.39 PaO2 + 36.2 (r = .89, SEE = 14.1). To assess these instruments as trend monitors, we compared the changes in simultaneous PaO2, PiaO2, and PtcO2 values; by linear regression: delta PiaO2 = 0.90 delta PaO2 + 3.88 (r = .96, SEE = 27.7); delta PtcO2 = 0.43 delta PaO2 + 5.6 (r = .94, SEE = 15.2). We conclude that, although these instruments correlate highly with the PaO2, the SEE was substantial and therefore may limit their clinical reliability in adults. Any acute or clinically significant change in PiaO2 or PtcO2 should be confirmed with a blood gas PaO2.\r"

To document the frequency of diarrhea in this population, explore the relation between hypoalbuminemia and diarrhea, and make a preliminary assessment of a peptide-based, chemically defined diet in these catabolic patients, a study of consecutive medical ICU patients was begun. For each patient, we recorded the principal diagnosis, type of diet received, the frequency and volume of stool, and the serum albumin concentration at admission. When diarrhea developed, attention was paid to the serum albumin levels as well as the effects of various diets. Overall, 12 (34%) of 35 study patients developed diarrhea. No patient had a previous history of diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, or GI symptoms that may precede the onset of diarrhea. The stools from each patient with diarrhea were examined for enteric pathogens, ova and parasites, Clostridium difficile culture and cytotoxin assay, and qualitative stool fat, which were all negative. Every patient with a serum albumin level less than 2.6 g/dl developed diarrhea. No patient with a serum albumin level of 2.6 g/dl or greater developed diarrhea, regardless of the type of nutritional support received. Four of the 12 patients with hypoalbuminemia and diarrhea were placed on a peptide-based, chemically defined diet, after which their diarrhea resolved and their serum albumin concentrations increased.\r"

  ".W": "The venous-arterial PCO2 gradient may increase in certain low-flow states, such as CPR and canine endotoxemia. To determine whether venous hypercarbia also occurs in hemorrhagic shock, we studied 12 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. We performed laparotomies on the animals, inserting catheters into their renal, superior mesenteric, and external iliac veins. Flow in the corresponding arteries were determined using electromagnetic flow probes. The dogs were randomized into a control group (n = 6), and a hemorrhagic shock group (n = 6) which was bled to a mean arterial pressure of 45 to 50 mm Hg and maintained at this pressure for the 6-h study. The results demonstrated a significant (p less than .05) increase in lactate and venous-arterial PCO2 gradient systemically and in all three regional beds. A significant decrease of venous blood pH accompanied these changes which are consistent with our previous findings in low-flow, canine endotoxemia. We conclude that venous hypercarbia is a nonspecific phenomenon, common to low-flow states. The increased CO2 represents both an increased CO2 production and a decreased removal, secondary to low-flow.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) would improve cardiovascular function and survival in circulatory shock by opposing the adverse effects of endogenous opioids and other pathophysiologic mediators. Cynomolgus monkeys and mongrel dogs were anesthetized and catheterized to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular contractility (LV dp/dtmax). Hemorrhagic shock was induced by bleeding into a reservoir to achieve and maintain MAP at 45 mm Hg for one hour. Endotoxic shock was produced by the iv injection of an LD80 dose of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (3 mg/kg in dogs and 5 mg/kg in monkeys). Animals were treated iv with either TRH (2 mg/kg plus 2 mg/kg X h) or equivolume saline. TRH significantly increased MAP and LV dp/dtmax in primate hemorrhagic and endotoxic shock. In primate hemorrhagic shock, TRH significantly (p = .02) improved survival (alive/total = 4/5 vs. 0/5). However, TRH had no effect on survival in endotoxemic primates. In contrast, TRH treatment in dogs produced only a transient hemodynamic response after endotoxemia and no significant hemodynamic effect after acute hemorrhage (even at twice the TRH dose). TRH did not affect survival in either dog model of circulatory shock. Based on extensive evidence with the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone in other studies, endogenous opioids play a role in the cardiovascular depression in primate and canine circulatory shock. From these studies with TRH, we conclude that TRH is relatively ineffective in canine circulatory shock, and physiologic antagonism of the adverse effects of opioids and other cardiodepressant substances by TRH administration may prove to be a useful alternative treatment of primate hemorrhagic shock.\r"

Effective antituberculosis drug therapy has reduced childhood exposure, resulting in an increase in adult primary tuberculosis with unusual clinical and roentgenographic presentations. We studied four adults with endobronchial tuberculosis who presented with unusual lobe involvement mimicking bronchogenic carcinoma. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy illustrated the range of endobronchial appearances, including evolution of mucosal ulcer to hyperplastic polyp and bronchostenosis. Complete fibrostenosis with lobar atelectasis was observed in one patient, and an eroding tuberculous lymph node in another. In the current era, endobronchial tuberculosis is more likely to be discovered in adults with progressive primary tuberculosis who have non-cavitary lower lung field infiltrates. Bronchial mucosal ulceration can result from submucosal lymphatic spread of organisms from adjacent parenchymal disease, as well as implantation.\r"

Ninety patients (female: male = 3.6:1) met clinical and hemodynamic criteria for PPH. Age at diagnosis was 29.8 +/- 7.9 years (mean +/- SD) (range 13-48 years). Symptom duration was 65.9 +/- 47.4 months, while survival from diagnosis was 42.9 +/- 42.6 months, giving a mean lead time of 23 months. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) at diagnosis was 61.6 +/- 15.0 mm Hg. The incidence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) was 19 percent, postpartum onset 16 percent, family history 6 percent, and cirrhosis 3 percent. The survival of 27 patients who died without operation was 50.3 +/- 52.5 months (median 37 months), with a symptom duration of 68.4 +/- 57.5 months (median 64 months). Both a high mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (p less than 0.025) and high mean PAP (p less than 0.025) correlated inversely with survival. For the whole group, none of the variables, age at diagnosis, sex, mean PAP or mean RAP at diagnosis, symptom duration prior to diagnosis or the presence of a PFO, postpartum onset or positive family history, significantly influenced survival. However, a low cardiac output (p less than 0.05) adversely influenced prognosis. The discrepancy between the mean and median length of survival in our group and previous reports confirms the need for further clarification of natural history and for appropriate clinical trials to assess therapeutic endeavors.\r"

On the other hand, in patients called \"noncorrectors\" in whom a decrease in PaCO2 was not seen during wakefulness with CMA, there was also no effect during sleep. These results indicate that CMA is effective in certain selected patients with COPD.\r"

A new in vitro assay was used by which [1-14C]arachidonic acid is incorporated by purified peripheral PMNs until steady state was obtained (5 hr). After preincubation with the test drugs prior to activation with calcium ionophore A23187, the released eicosanoids were isolated by extraction and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitated by autoradiography and laser densitometry. Median drug concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) release was 4-5 mM (range 1-9 mM) for both sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. The acetylated derivative of 5-aminosalicylic acid was ineffective. The present data suggest that inhibition of arachidonic acid lipoxygenation may be an essential action of sulfasalazine and its active metabolite, 5-aminosalicylic acid. Interference with lipoxygenase enzymes, rather than a steroid-like inhibition of arachidonic acid release from intracellular phospholipids, seems to be the mode of action.\r"

These five children, who initially responded poorly to standard in-hospital diabetes management, were selected for a program of intensified therapy directed at achieving more stable blood glucose control. Optimized conventional therapy was first employed for 16 +/- 5 mo and did not improve substantially blood glucose level or stability. During this period, there was an average of almost one episode of ketonuria per patient per month, and three diabetic ketoacidosis episodes were observed. Because of its limited efficacy, the treatment was then changed to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This mode of therapy had a rapid favorable effect on blood glucose control, with no concomitant increase of the frequencies of ketonuria or diabetic ketoacidosis, most of which occurred during the first months of insulin pump therapy. Deliberate cessation of either conventional or subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for 7 h under close in-hospital control resulted in similar metabolic changes: a slight nonconstant increase of blood glucose, and an abrupt rise of blood 3-hydroxybutyrate to 3 mM, with massive ketonuria. The management of these young diabetic children with insulin pump therapy was thus not associated with an increased frequency or an accelerated rate of development of ketosis. However, the possible failures originating from the infusing device and the rapid increase of ketosis in young ages require special vigilance from the parents, based on twice-daily urine testing for ketones and appropriate insulin supplementation.\r"

Insulin (8 U/h i.v.), fluid replacement (0.65% NaCl and 5% glucose), and KCl supplements were administered according to a fixed protocol. Glucose, potassium, sodium, creatinine, calcium, phosphate, and free-insulin concentrations were never significantly different during the study. At the start, mean +/- SD of pH was 7.10 +/- 0.14 in the HI group and 7.10 +/- 0.12 in the PI group. The time to reach arbitrary values for pH, bicarbonate, base excess, and beta-hydroxybutyrate was shorter during HI treatment, but the differences were not statistically significant. During HI treatment, the arbitrary value of 1.0 mM of acetoacetate was reached faster than during PI treatment (5.2 +/- 2.6 and 8.4 +/- 0.9 h, respectively; P less than .05). The concentration of acetoacetate was significantly different between the two groups after 6 and 7 h of insulin treatment (6 h: HI 0.82 +/- 0.50 mM and PI 2.19 +/- 1.65 mM, P less than .05; 7 h: HI 0.51 +/- 0.40 mM and PI 1.74 +/- 1.54 mM, P = .05). We conclude that recovery from DKA during treatment with HI might be slightly faster than during treatment with PI. If this difference is real, it does not seem clinically important.\r"

The direct costs of care measurable through a retrospective review of patient records were examined, including the cost of antibiotic acquisition, drug administration, laboratory testing, and room and board. Results of a regression analysis show that cefoperazone as initial therapy is associated with lower costs for all factors studied except acquisition cost. Antibiotic acquisition averaged $24 per patient more for the cefoperazone group (p less than 0.01). However, for cefoperazone patients drug administration was $63 less (p less than 0.0001), laboratory testing costs averaged $9 less (p = 0.22), and costs associated with room and board charges were $80 less (p = 0.40). Total costs averaged $3073 per cefoperazone patient and $3228 per control patient (p = 0.20). These data suggest that the previously accepted definitions of antimicrobial costs (i.e., cost per gram, cost per dose, cost per day) may no longer be adequate in this era of cost containment. In order to make sound clinical decisions with lowest total costs, practitioners should identify how and where costs are incurred.\r"

  ".W": "Permanent effects of postnatal gonadal function on the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis were examined in male and female rats of the Wistar-Imamichi strain. Animals were used at the age of about 10 weeks. Neonatally castrated (NC) males showed a significantly higher plasma TSH response to TRH (10 micrograms/kg BW, ip) than males castrated at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks of age. The TSH response in intact males was similar to that seen in NC males. Neonatal androgenization of NC males with 100 micrograms/rat of testosterone propionate decreased the TSH response in the group. The anterior pituitary (AP) TSH content was similar among all male groups. The number of AP TRH receptors was significantly higher in both NC males and intact males than in both NC + neonatal androgenization males and 6-week-castrated males. In female rats, TRH-induced TSH response, AP TSH content, and AP TRH receptor number were all unaffected by the age of castration, whereas intact females significantly exceeded 6-week-castrated females in these three variables. The circulating levels of T3 and T4 and hypothalamic TRH content were similar in all groups in each sex. These results indicate biphasic effects of postnatal testosterone on the TSH response to TRH, that is, a permanent inhibition in early postnatal days and a transient stimulation in adult age. The effects occurred not via changes in AP TSH content but via changes in AP TRH receptor number. In females, however, postnatal gonads did not exert any permanent effects on the TRH-TSH system.\r"

  ".U": "87190050\r", 
  ".W": "Rat somatotroph and lactotroph hormone storage is divisible into at least two functional compartments: an immediate release pool (IRP) and a pool that responds to prolonged stimulation. An IRP substructure has been defined by release in response to potassium ion (K+), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), and Bu2cAMP. The somatotroph IRP is expandable; the lactotroph IRP is fixed in size. The present experiments examined which IRP components contribute to the rapid release of stored GH in response to GH-releasing factor-44 (GRF). Release of stored PRL was monitored for comparison. In vitro prelabeling defined stored rat (r) GH and rPRL. Release in response to 21 mM K+, 3 microM PGE1, 1 mM Bu2cAMP, and/or 3 nM GRF was monitored with a perifusion-immunoprecipitation system. After 120 min of basal perifusion, tissue was exposed to one of the four secretagogues for 90 min. During a second 90-min period a second secretagogue was added while exposure to the first secretagogue continued. We demonstrated that 21 mM K+ reduces peak rGH release in response to 3 nM GRF by 52%, whereas GRF does not reduce rGH release in response to K+; 3 microM PGE1 reduces rGH release in response to GRF by only 19% although GRF reduces rGH release in response to PGE1 by 88%; 1 mM Bu2cAMP reduces rGH release in response to GRF by 87%, and GRF eliminates rGH release in response to Bu2cAMP (1.2% of control value); combined K+ plus Bu2cAMP reduce rGH release in response to GRF to 2.5% of the control value, whereas after GRF pretreatment rGH release in response to combined K+ plus Bu2cAMP is 93% of the control value; and combined PGE1 and Bu2cAMP reduce the response to GRF to 17% of the control value. Effects on rPRL release are qualitatively similar. We conclude that immediate GRF-stimulated release of stored rGH originates in the somatotroph IRP components defined by responses to PGE1 and Bu2cAMP; it derives only slightly, if at all, from the IRP component defined by the response to K+. The smaller GRF-stimulated release of IRP rPRL is similarly derived.\r"

  ".W": "We used autoradiography to test the hypothesis that a major function of thyroid hormone-binding proteins in plasma is to ensure uniform distribution of thyroid hormones among cells of a given tissue. The distribution of [125I]T4 within rat hepatic lobules was determined after its single pass perfusion through the portal vein in solutions containing or lacking thyroid hormone-binding proteins. These proteins included thyroid hormone-binding globulin, thyroid hormone-binding prealbumin, and albumin. In the absence of these proteins, virtually all of the perfused T4 was taken up by the periportal cells, and subsequent perfusion with protein-free solution did not cause redistribution of this T4. In the presence of these proteins, in contrast, the perfused T4 was taken up uniformly by all cells within the lobule. Albumin alone was sufficient to ensure uniform cellular uptake of T4. However, variation of oleic acid concentrations within the physiological range markedly influenced the concentration of free T4 in a solution of 4% human serum albumin, but not in human serum. These results indicate that uniform distribution of T4 within tissues requires circulating thyroid hormone-binding proteins, and that the specific binding proteins, thyroid hormone-binding globulin and thyroid hormone-binding prealbumin, are required to ensure nonfluctuating circulating concentrations of free T4 in vivo. Other hormone-binding proteins in plasma and some transport proteins may function similarly.\r"

  ".U": "87190060\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to evaluate the effects of chronic morphine exposure on the negative and positive feedback effects of estradiol (E2) on LH and FSH secretion in ovariectomized rats. Two days of E2 exposure reduced at 1000 h and stimulated at 1600 h the serum LH concentration at each dose tested. Chronic exposure (4 days) to morphine enhanced both the inhibitory effects of E2 on LH secretion at 1000 h and E2 induction of the midafternoon surge in LH. A detailed time course of the afternoon LH response to E2 revealed that chronic morphine exposure advanced its time of onset and increased its magnitude. The response of FSH to E2 and the interaction between E2 and morphine on FSH secretion were similar to those observed for LH, albeit lower in magnitude. With extension of the E2 exposure period from 2 to 4 days, the synergistic interaction between E2 and morphine persisted for the negative, but not the positive, feedback action on LH. Chronic morphine exposure in ovariectomized rats, without E2 replacement, was ineffective in altering the LH levels at 1000 h, but had a slight stimulatory effect on LH at 1600 h, indicating an E2 requirement for the observed suppression and stimulation of LH in the morning and afternoon, respectively. The response of the anterior pituitary to exogenously administered LHRH in the morning (1000 h) and during the midafternoon hypersecretion of LH (1800 h) was markedly enhanced in animals exposed chronically to morphine. Thus, the chronic stimulation of opiate receptors with morphine enhances the inhibition and subsequent hypersecretion of LH in E2-exposed rats, advances the time of onset and enhances the magnitude of the E2-induced LH surge, and augments the response to LHRH when LH levels are low in the morning and during the E2-induced hypersecretion of LH. These data support an important role for opioid neuronal systems in the mechanism that switches the E2 signal for gonadotropin secretion from inhibitory to stimulatory and, hence, in the series of neuronal events that leads to phasic secretion of gonadotropins.\r"

  ".W": "The relative contributions of arachidonic acid (AA)- and protein kinase C-dependent pathways during the immediate LH response to short term stimulation by GnRH were analyzed in perifused anterior pituitary cells cultured on Cytodex beads. The LH response to a 2-min pulse of 10 nM GnRH was biphasic, with a rapid increase to an initial peak, followed by a second peak or shoulder before the gradual return to baseline release. Retinal, which inhibits activation of protein kinase C, reduced the total LH response to GnRH by 35-40% and advanced the termination of the response, but did not alter the height, position, or rate of onset of the initial LH peak. In contrast, pretreatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid decreased the total LH response to GnRH by 60%, reduced the magnitude and latency of the first LH peak, and shortened the duration of the response. Pretreatment with both retinal and nordihydroguaiaretic acid abolished the GnRH-induced LH release. Addition of 2-min pulses of AA induced LH responses of short duration that coincided with the first phase of GnRH-stimulated LH release. Application of 2-min pulses of either tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or dioctanoyl glycerol generated LH responses with delayed onsets that corresponded to the second phase of the GnRH-induced response. The LH response to the combined action of AA and TPA approximated that induced by GnRH. These results suggest that mobilization and metabolism of AA are important in the rapid initial phase of the LH response to GnRH, and that activation of protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms participates in the maintenance of the LH response. During continuous perifusion with 10 nM GnRH, addition of 2-min pulses of 100 nM GnRH and 100 microM AA, but not 100 nM TPA, stimulated further increases in LH release. This suggests that during prolonged GnRH action, LH release is primarily maintained by protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms. The results of this study indicate that GnRH stimulation of LH release requires the coordinated actions of at least two major interrelated mechanisms, namely those activated by AA and/or its metabolites and those maintained by protein kinase C-dependent pathways.\r"

  ".W": "cDNA probes specific for the regulatory (R) subunits [RII51; (mol wt, 51,000) and RI (mol wt, 49,000)] and a catalytic (C alpha) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases were used to analyze the hormonal regulation, tissue distribution, and content of mRNAs for these kinase subunits in the rat ovary. Filter hybridization assays demonstrated that mRNA specific for RII51 increased in both thecal and granulosa cells of preovulatory (PO) follicles, then declined precipitously (less than 10-fold) in both cell types within 7 h after an ovulatory (10-IU) dose of hCG and remained low in corpora lutea. Dose-response studies showed that doses of FSH greater than 2 micrograms were required to increase RII51 mRNA in granulosa cells of hypophysectomized (H) rats, whereas doses of 0.5-1.0 micrograms were effective in granulosa cells of H estradiol-treated (HE) rats. At all doses (0.5-50 micrograms) of FSH administered, RII51 mRNA was 4 times higher in granulosa cells of HE rats than in H rats. Solution hybridization assays demonstrated that the concentration of RII51 mRNA increased 6-fold from 20 molecules/granulosa cell in H rats to 120 molecules/cell in H rats treated with estradiol and FSH (HEF). Transcription assays using nuclei of granulosa cells demonstrated further that the 5- to 10-fold increases in RII51 mRNA content in estradiol-/FSH-induced granulosa cells was associated with increased transcription of the RII51 gene. In thecal cells of small antral (SA), PO, and luteinizing follicles, changes in the content of mRNA for RI and C alpha kinase subunits showed a pattern similar to that for RII51. However, in granulosa cells, mRNA specific for RI and C alpha was highest in SA follicles, declined in PO follicles, and remained unchanged during luteinization. The content of mRNA for RI (45-70 molecules/cell) and C alpha (10 molecules/cell) also changed less than 2-fold in granulosa cells of H, HE, and HEF rats. In summary, these results indicate that the content of RII51 mRNA is hormonally regulated in both thecal cells and granulosa cells during follicular development and luteinization. Low concentrations of gonadotropins increase RII51 mRNA, whereas an ovulatory dose of hCG causes mRNA for RII51 to decrease rapidly. In granulosa cells, induction of mRNA for RII51, but not that for RI and C alpha is induced by the actions of estradiol and FSH, and involves increased transcription of the RII51 gene.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally accepted that hypothalamic somatostatin and hepatic insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)/somatomedin-C act directly on the pituitary to inhibit GH release, but it is not known whether all somatotropes are responsive to these agents. In the present study, we used a reverse hemolytic plaque assay to compare the acute (8 h) effects of somatostatin and IGF-I on the release of GH from individual cells in 24-h cultures of male rat pituitaries. Treatment with these factors caused comparable dose-dependent decreases in both the rate of plaque formation and the percentage of cells which released GH. In 8-h incubations, maximal (10(-8) M) doses of IGF-I or somatostatin alone decreased the percentage of GH-releasing cells to approximately the same degree (from 34.4% in controls to 29.7% and 28.4%, respectively), yet the effects of these factors were additive when both agents were applied to the same cells (to 24.5%). When we analyzed the sizes of plaques (an index of the amount of hormone released per cell) which resulted from these treatments, we noted that somatostatin was a much greater suppressor (to 11% of control value) of GH release than IGF-I (60% of controls). Coincubation with 10(-8) M GH-releasing factor had no effect on the percentage of GH-releasing cells at 8 h but completely overrode the inhibitory effect of IGF-I on plaque size without affecting the somatostatin-induced decrease in this regard. Taken together, these data suggest that IGF-I and somatostatin act, at least in part, on separate subpopulations of rat somatotropes. Somatostatin is a much more effective inhibitor of total GH release than IGF-I and appears to affect most, if not all, somatotropes. In contrast, IGF-I acutely inhibits GH release (prevents plaque formation) from some somatotropes, but does not seem to affect the remaining GH cells.\r"

  ".W": "Using an affinity-purified antibody against cholesterol side-chain cleavage P450 (P450scc) and a human P450scc cDNA probe, 11 rat P450scc cDNA clones were identified and isolated from our rat granulosa cell lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. Two clones were plaque purified and subcloned into pBR322. One of these P450scc cDNA clones, approximately 1.2 kilobases (kb) in size, was used as a probe for Northern and filter hybridization assays to analyze the tissue distribution and hormonal regulation of P450scc mRNA in rat ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. Northern transfers revealed a single P450scc mRNA species about 2.0 kb in size. Filter hybridization assays showed that P450scc mRNA was low in granulosa cells and thecal cells of small antral follicles, was increased in both tissues of preovulatory follicles, and was rapidly (within 7 h) and maximally increased (30-fold) during hCG-induced luteinization. P450scc enzyme and mRNA were also elevated in corpora lutea isolated from pregnant rats (days 4-22 of gestation) and rats 1 day after parturition (day 23). The elevation of P450scc enzyme and mRNA was maintained despite the marked decline in serum progesterone concentrations between days 19-22, suggesting that once P450scc mRNA is induced in luteal tissue it may be constitutively expressed. Administering hormones to granulosa cells in culture and to hypophysectomized immature rats in vivo demonstrated that the induction of P450scc mRNA by FSH in granulosa cells was time, dose, and estradiol dependent. High doses of FSH acting on estradiol-primed cells gave the greatest response. The increase in P450scc mRNA in cultured granulosa cells was also stimulated by forskolin and was directly associated with increased synthesis of cAMP and progesterone accumulation. Thus, whereas the induction of P450scc mRNA in granulosa cells was dependent on hormones and cAMP, the maintenance of P450scc mRNA and P450scc protein in corpora lutea appears to involve constitutive expression of P450scc mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "Collagenases that specifically cleave native collagen at neutral pH have been implicated in the maintenance and turnover of connective tissue. In bone, the origin of neutral collagenase has remained equivocal, although recent studies have indicated that it is synthesized by the osteoblast. In the present work, regulation of secretion of neutral collagenase and a collagenase inhibitory activity was investigated using the osteoblastic tumor cell line UMR 106-01 and a variety of bone-resorbing agents. Under basal conditions, UMR 106-01 cells produced very low levels of collagenase but substantial amounts of the inhibitory activity. Exposure to PTH and, to a lesser extent, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, retinoic acid, and epidermal growth factor stimulated the release of collagenase, an effect not seen with interleukin-1 or heparin. The stimulation of collagenase by PTH was dose dependent, with a half-maximal response occurring at 10(-8) M. Inclusion of isobutylmethylxanthine decreased the concentration of PTH required to produce half-maximal stimulation to 2 X 10(-10) M, indicating action via cAMP. With respect to the inhibitory activity, PTH and epidermal growth factor were the only agents, among those tested, able to enhance its production. Both hormones caused a 50-100% increase over control levels 72 h after hormone administration. There were notable differences in the time courses of production of collagenase and the inhibitor. After treatment with PTH, the enzyme reached maximal concentrations between 12-48 h, but declined to undetectable levels by 96 h. In contrast, the inhibitory activity was secreted in a linear fashion, with the highest concentrations achieved around 72-96 h. These results suggest a complex pattern of regulation of collagenase and inhibitor secretion by the osteoblastic cell, with the steady accumulation of inhibitor perhaps being responsible for the ultimate curtailment of enzyme activity.\r"

  ".W": "Aside from studies of a possible synergism between T3 and glucocorticoids in regulating GH mRNA, there have been few previous studies of the modulation by hormones and other factors of glucocorticoid hormone regulation of pituitary cell GH gene expression. We have employed a serum-free medium containing no exogenously added Ca2+ to investigate whether Ca2+ or somatostatin influences the stimulation by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone of GH mRNA levels in GH3 cells. Basal levels were slightly (less than or equal to 2-fold) stimulated by CaCl2 (0.4 mM). The stimulation by dexamethasone (100 nM) of GH mRNA in GH3 cells incubated in serum-free medium with or without Ca2+ was, respectively, 20- and 25-fold. Thus, under these experimental conditions, little effect of Ca2+ on regulation by dexamethasone was observed. To further reduce Ca2+ levels in the incubation medium, EGTA (20 microM) was added to chelate residual Ca2+. In some but not all experiments, EGTA treatment yielded a slight decrease in basal GH mRNA levels. Time-course experiments performed in the presence of EGTA showed that during incubation periods with dexamethasone that yielded a detectable stimulation of GH mRNA (2-4 days), Ca2+ (0.4 mM) inhibited the dexamethasone stimulation by 3- to 5-fold. Investigations of the dose-response relationship of the effect of dexamethasone on GH mRNA performed under the same conditions showed that at dexamethasone concentrations that yielded a significant stimulation of GH mRNA (10 nM or greater), Ca2+ (0.4 mM) inhibited the dexamethasone stimulation by about 2-fold. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ on the stimulation by dexamethasone of GH mRNA in the GH3 cells, somatostatin had no effect at any concentration tested (1-1000 nM) on dexamethasone regulation of this mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "87190089\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported that passive immunoneutralization of endogenous LHRH in castrate male rats completely abolishes pulsatile LH secretion and, within 1 h, lowers mean plasma LH by 86%. While pulsatile FSH secretion, in terms of pulse amplitude and frequency, is not affected, mean plasma FSH is gradually lowered but only by 49% after 24 h. In the present study, we have examined the effect of replacing pulsatile LHRH biological activity on LH and FSH secretion in 4-week castrate male rats in which endogenous LHRH has been immunoneutralized by ovine anti-LHRH serum 772 (LHRH-AS) for 24 h. The LHRH-AS requires the 3-10 amino acid sequence of LHRH including the amidated C terminus for complete recognition. In order to circumvent the antiserum blockade, we utilized the LHRH agonist [Des Gly10]-LHRH ethyl amide (DG-LHRH) which is minimally recognized by the LHRH-AS but which possesses 2.6-fold the LH-releasing activity of LHRH. Twenty-four hours after injecting 500 microliter LHRH-AS into cannulated, castrate rats, sequential blood samples were taken every 10 min for 4 h. Bolus 3-ng injections of either DG-LHRH or saline were given iv either every 30 min during the 4-h collection period or every 30 or 60 min for 10 h before the initiation of and continuing through the 4-h collection period. Each DG-LHRH injection stimulated the release of a single pulse of LH, while pulsatile FSH secretion was unaffected. No synchrony was observed between the DG-LHRH pulses and the endogenous FSH pulses. Short term DG-LHRH treatment partially restored, and long term DG-LHRH treatment every 60 min completely restored, mean plasma FSH to the level observed in nonantiserum-treated castrate control rats. Long term DG-LHRH treatment every 30 min caused a rise in mean plasma FSH which exceeded the plasma FSH level of the nonantiserum-treated controls. The mean plasma level of LH was entirely dependent on the frequency of the DG-LHRH injection. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that pulsatile FSH secretion is independent of LHRH but that LHRH is required to elevate and/or maintain high mean plasma FSH levels. Trough levels of LH, however, are dependent on the frequency of LHRH-induced pulsatile LH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human (h) and murine (m) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulated bone resorption and the production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in neonatal mouse calvaria in organ culture. In experiments of 72-h duration, the effect on bone resorption was of large magnitude (an average increase in medium calcium of 3.3 mg/dl above control values in 11 separate experiments) and occurred over a concentration range of 0.1-20 ng/ml mTNF and 0.5-50 ng/ml hTNF. Accompanying the TNF-enhanced release of bone calcium there was enhanced accumulation of PGE2 in the culture medium. The increases in medium calcium and PGE2 were both inhibited completely by nontoxic concentrations of 4 different PG cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin, piroxicam, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid) but not by the noncyclooxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid. The magnitude of the PGE2 response, but not the calcium release, was less for bones treated with TNF than for those treated with equipotent doses of epidermal growth factor or human transforming growth factors-alpha or -beta, suggesting that the local site of production of PGE2 in bone may be different for TNF than for the other factors. Repeated sc injections of hTNF to intact mice for a 48-h period produced a statistically significant elevation of the plasma calcium concentration. Because TNF is produced by cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in response to invasive stimuli such as the presence of tumor, our findings indicate that a host factor produced in response to malignant cells can cause enhanced bone resorption. Thus, the concept of the humoral hypercalcemias of malignancy must be expanded to include mediators not produced by the tumor cells themselves.\r"

  ".W": "Recent electrophysiological studies from this laboratory demonstrated that anterior lobe corticotropes exhibited a tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current and two types of voltage-dependent calcium currents, consisting of low threshold (transient) and high threshold (long lasting) components. The present report describes cytophysiological and cytochemical studies that used specific blockers of each of these currents to assess their role in the regulation of CRF binding and ACTH secretion and storage. Two dihydropyridines, nimodipine and the pure antagonist enantiomer (-)R202-791, which block high threshold Ca2+ channels, decreased 1 h basal release by 54-74% and CRF-mediated (5 min or 3 h) release completely. Percentages of CRF-bound cells were reduced as much as 74%; however, the inhibitory effect on percentages of CRF-bound cells could be reversed by adding 10 nM Bay K 8644, (a pure dihydropyridine agonist) with the antagonists. CdCl2, which blocks both high and low threshold calcium currents, inhibited basal and CRF-stimulated ACTH release, but only the highest concentration (0.1 mM) reduced percentages of CRF-bound cells. Involvement of the low threshold Ca2+ channels could not be proved by adding dihydropyridine antagonists with 0.1 mM CdCl2. Basal and CRF-mediated ACTH release were blocked by the potent sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin, and the highest concentration (3 microM) reduced percentages of CRF-bound cells. Basal (1 h) and CRF-stimulated (5 min) ACTH release were also inhibited in medium containing 1 mM EGTA and no Ca2+; however, percentages of CRF-bound cells were within the normal range. Densitometric analysis of stains for ACTH showed an increase in the concentration of stain per cell after a 1-h exposure to the highest concentrations of the inhibitors or to no Ca2+ and 1 mM EGTA coupled with a significant (10%) decrease in corticotrope cell area. Finally, in the last series of tests, the Bay K 8644 agonist or arginine vasopressin were used to study mechanisms of augmentation of basal or CRF-mediated ACTH release. Bay K 8644 augmented basal release in a concentration of 1 microM and CRF-mediated release in a concentration of 100 nM or 1 microM. After pretreatment with either Bay K 8644 or arginine vasopressin (10 nM) there was a significant (30%) increase in the percentage of CRF-bound cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In a calibrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system, the major substrates from cat ileum gave mol wt of about 15K and 20K. Minor bands of substrates, possible aggregates, were observed under both reducing and nonreducing conditions at 40K and 75K. Substrate-derived immunoreactive NMN was indistinguishable from synthetic or native NMN during reverse phase HPLC and gave equal measurements with two antisera with different specificities. During equilibrium centrifugation of isotonic homogenates of cat brain and ileum in a gradient of sucrose, NMN and the substrates banded together, apparently associated with particles resembling synaptosomes and vesicles.

  ".W": "It has been suggested that a result of streptozotocin (Sz)-initiated damage to beta-cell DNA is activation of the repair enzyme nuclear poly-ADP-ribose (p-ADPR) synthetase and subsequent depletion of cellular NAD. This reduction of NAD is presumed responsible for the impaired islet function. Using freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets, we have examined the ability of p-ADPR synthetase inhibitors, in particular the previously not studied thymidine, to block Sz-induced damage to the B cell. Islets were incubated in 2 mM glucose and 2 mM Sz with or without p-ADPR synthetase inhibitor and then challenged for 1 h with 25 mM glucose plus 25 microM forskolin or 100 nM phorbol ester without glucose. Sz treatment inhibited insulin secretion about 90% even when stimulated by the non-glucose-containing challenge, indicating that Sz caused a rapid and generalized lesion past glucose-specific signals. Thymidine maintained the insulin secretory response to glucose plus forskolin from Sz-treated islets as, or more, effectively than nicotinamide. In a dose-dependent manner, thymidine protected Sz-treated islets to 87% of normal islet secretion at the highest thymidine dose (20 mM). However, even protected islets could not sustain normal secretion; insulin secretion was significantly diminished in thymidine-protected islets challenged with a second consecutive 1-h glucose plus forskolin stimulus. As expected, the acute depletion of islet NAD content (approximately 50%, 1 h after Sz) was reversed to 90% of normal by thymidine. However, even in unprotected Sz-treated islets, NAD content gradually recovered over 48 h of culture in standard RPMI, although insulin secretion remained suppressed. Thus, thymidine may be a useful protective agent against chemically induced islet cell damage. Furthermore, a sustained suppression of NAD content does not explain Sz's permanent inhibition of islet secretory response. Other aspects of inhibited nuclear p-ADP-ribosylation are considered to explain protection against Sz damage to the beta-cell.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that FSH caused a dose-dependent increase in plasminogen activator (PA) production by cultured rat granulosa cells. PA production was assayed by culturing granulosa cells, obtained from immature diethylstilbestrol-treated rats, on [125I]fibrin plates and determining the extent of fibrinolysis after the addition of the specific substrate plasminogen. To study the effect of ovarian steroids on FSH-stimulated PA production, concomitant treatment with FSH and estradiol [(E2) 10(-7) M], progesterone [(P) 10(-6) M], testosterone [(T) 10(-7) M] or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone [(DHT) 10(-7) M] were tested in these cultures. Treatment with E2 significantly enhanced the FSH-stimulated PA production by 35-210% over the whole range of the FSH dose response curve. The augmentation of FSH-stimulated PA production by E2 was not affected by the concomitant treatment with the antiprogestin RU 486 (10(-6) M). Similarly, P significantly enhanced the FSH-stimulated PA production by 34 to 90%. The stimulating action of P on FSH-dependent PA production was blocked by the simultaneous treatment with RU 486. Concomitant treatment with T significantly increased the FSH-induced PA production by 22-60%. That the effect of T was not due to the aromatization to E2 was evidenced by the augmentation by DHT of FSH-stimulated PA production. DHT caused a significant 20-39% enhancement in the responsiveness of the granulosa cells to FSH by further increasing PA production. The enhancement of PA production by androgen is decreased partially by concomitant treatment with the antiandrogen flutamide (10(-5) M) and the antiprogestin RU 486. These in vitro data demonstrated the importance of estrogens, progestogens, and androgens in modulating the stimulating effect of FSH on PA production by immature rat granulosa cells.\r"

Rats with STZ-diabetes of 6- to 8-week duration had significantly lower body weights, higher plasma and urinary glucose concentrations, greater urinary volumes, increased kidney weights, and increased kidney/body weights and protein/kidney weight ratios compared to those in saline-citrate-injected controls. Specific Na+,K+-ATPase activity per mg protein in both cortical and outer medullary kidney homogenates was significantly elevated in diabetic vs. control animals, as was total renal Na+,K+-ATPase activity. One week of insulin treatment returned elevated plasma glucose, urinary volume, the protein/kidney weight ratio, and cortical and outer medullary Na+,K+-ATPase activity per mg protein to control values. Kidney weights and kidney/body weight ratios of diabetic animals remained elevated, as did absolute total renal Na+,K+-ATPase activity. After 3 weeks of insulin treatment, kidney weight and total renal Na+,K+-ATPase activity in diabetic animals returned to control values, but body weights remained lower than those in the controls, resulting in continued elevation of kidney/body weight ratios in the diabetic animals. The concurrent regression of both renal hypertrophy and elevated Na+,K+-ATPase activity to normal levels after insulin treatment of STZ-diabetic animals implicates renal growth rather than a direct effect of insulin as the primary factor controlling elevation and regression of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the diabetic kidney. This finding demonstrates that the effect of renal hypertrophy can outweigh the intrinsic effects of insulin on an important renal transport system and that this effect may be as important as lack of hormone in determining the renal physiological responses in the disease. It is suggested that the increased renal tubular Na+,K+-ATPase activity is a key component of the renal hypertrophy and hyperfunction seen in diabetes.\r"

FSH and other cAMP-inducing ligands, including cholera toxin, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP, elevated the PA activity of granulosa cells in a concentration-dependent manner during a 4-h culture, with an approximate 10-fold maximal increase in PA activity compared to control cells. Negligible levels of PA activity were observed in the extracellular medium in the absence or presence of hormones. The PA induced by FSH or cAMP in intact cells was progressively neutralized during the 4-h culture by increasing amounts of antibodies to the tissue-type PA (tPA), but not by an IgG fraction against the urokinase-type PA (UK-PA). However, solubilization of granulosa cells with Triton X-100 revealed the presence of intracellular UK-PA activity in both FSH-treated and control cells that consisted of about 20% of the total cellular PA activity. Electrophoretic analysis of extracts from solubilized granulosa cells indicated the presence of three peaks of PA activity. A PA with a Mr of 70,000 was induced by FSH, was completely inactivated by tPA antibodies, and required fibrin for full activity. A 40,000 Mr fibrin-independent PA was also stimulated by FSH and was partially inhibited by UK-PA antibodies, but not by anti-tPA immunoglobulin G. A third peak of PA activity comigrated with a human UK-PA standard at a Mr of 33,000, was fully neutralized by UK-PA antibodies, and was largely present only in control cells. These results suggest that during the first hours of granulosa cell development, FSH via cAMP induces the production of a cell-surface tPA, while both FSH-treated and control cells synthesize intracellular UK-PAs. Hormonal regulation of the production and activities of these cellular enzymes may allow the expression of specific differentiated functions of developing granulosa cells.\r"

The injection of less than 10 ng of AVP induced no significant effects on ANP secretion. However, the administration of 5 ng of AVP significantly enhanced ANP secretion induced by intravascular volume expansion with 3 ml saline infusion.

  ".W": "It is established that the blockade of the pituitary LHRH receptor by an LHRH antagonist will suppress pituitary LH secretion and reduce serum concentrations of gonadal steroids. Little is known, however, about the activity of the LHRH/LH pulse generator during this inhibitory period or during the recovery phase. To investigate this, a potent LHRH antagonist [N-Ac-D-pCl-Phe1,D-pCl-Phe2,D-Trp3,D-hArg(Et2)6, D-Ala10 LHRH was injected iv into sexually active rams and the changes in the blood plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone, and PRL were measured in samples collected every 15 min for 24-48 h. The treatment induced an immediate blockade of pulsatile LH secretion and a parallel decline in blood levels of testosterone. Plasma levels of FSH were not suppressed by treatment with the LHRH antagonist and there was no consistent effect on plasma levels of PRL. The duration of the inhibition of LH was dose dependent lasting 4.3 +/- 0.4 h, 18.0 +/- 1.0 h, and 31.8 +/- 1.3 h for the low (6 micrograms/kg), medium (36 micrograms/kg), and high (365 micrograms/kg) doses of LHRH antagonist, respectively. During the recovery period there was an approximate 2-fold increase in the frequency of LH pulses. These results suggest a compensatory response to the decline in the negative feedback effect of testosterone secretion. Even the lowest dose of antagonist elicited a decrease in the level of testosterone and an increase in LH pulse frequency. At this dose, the decline in testosterone was very transitory indicating an acute sensitivity of the hypothalamus to changes in the negative feedback signal. These results suggest that the suppression of LH and testosterone secretion in the ram by LHRH antagonist is associated with a compensatory increase in the activity of the LHRH pulse generator.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have not identified a naturally occurring steroid that selectively inhibits FSH secretion without also inhibiting LH secretion. The effect of 3 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3-HP), a steroid produced in Sertoli cells, on gonadotropin secretion in intact and castrate male and female, prepubertal and adult rats and in cultures of anterior pituitary cells was investigated. Intact prepubertal male rats were treated with a single sc injection of 0.2 mg/kg 3-HP, and castrate male and female rats were given a daily sc injection of 0.2 mg/kg 3-HP for 4 days. Serum FSH levels were suppressed by 26-44% (P less than 0.001-0.05), with no similar effect on serum LH levels. The acetyl derivative of 3-HP (3-HPA), administered to castrate prepubertal and adult rats for 4 days (0.625 mg/kg), resulted in significant decreases (P less than 0.001) in serum FSH to 45% and 19% of castrate control levels, respectively, without a significant effect on LH levels. Treatment of castrate prepubertal male rats with various doses of 3-HPA (0.001-0.625 mg/kg X day) for 4 days resulted in a dose-related suppression of serum FSH. Similar results were obtained with chronic (14-day) treatment of intact male rats with 3-HPA. Treatment of young (15-day-old) intact males with either 3-HP or 17 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstan-3-one (DHT) for 14 days showed that DHT resulted in significant increases in prostate and seminal vesicle weights, while 3-HP showed no apparent androgenic activity. The effects of treatment with 3-HP, 3 beta-HP, 17 beta-estradiol, and DHT (0.025-0.625 mg/kg X day) were compared. Treatment with 3 beta-HP resulted in significant increases in serum FSH levels; 17 beta-estradiol and DHT suppressed both gonadotropins (at the higher doses administered), while 3-HP suppressed only FSH. 3-HP (3.16 X 10(-11) M) and/or LHRH (3 X 10(-8) M) were employed in primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. Addition of LHRH resulted in 6- to 8-fold increases in the secretion of FSH and LH, while 3-HP suppressed basal (P less than 0.05) and LHRH-stimulated (P less than 0.001) FSH secretion by 26% and 77%, respectively. We conclude that 3-HP selectively suppresses FSH secretion and may be involved in the normal regulation of FSH secretion in the male.\r"

  ".W": "In higher primates, the protracted delay from infancy to puberty results from an interruption in hypothalamic GnRH release. To determine whether the quiescent hypothalamic GnRH neurons of the prepubertal macaque are capable of discharging the decapeptide in response to a generalized neural depolarization, an excitatory amino acid analog, N-methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMA), was administered systemically to orchidectomized rhesus monkeys between 13 and 20 months of age. GnRH secretion was estimated indirectly by monitoring changes in circulating LH concentrations after the responsivity of pituitary gonadotropes to GnRH had been greatly facilitated by the chronic intermittent iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min every hour). The iv bolus administration of increasing doses of NMA (1.5, 4.8, and 15.0 mg/kg BW), 10-14 h after termination of the priming infusion of GnRH, elicited distinct discharges of LH, with magnitudes directly related to the amount of the excitant injected. Administration of a higher dose of NMA (48 mg/kg BW), however, failed to induce further LH release. The finding that pretreatment with a long-acting and potent GnRH receptor antagonist [( AcD2Nal1,4ClPhe2,DTrp3,DArg6,DAla10] GnRH-HOAc) abolished the LH-releasing activity of NMA provides compelling evidence for the view that the action of the neural excitant to induce gonadotropin release was exerted at a suprapituitary level. The additional observation that an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (D,L-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid) blocked the NMA-induced release of GnRH suggests that the amino acid analog interacted with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor on neurons that synthesize and/or control the release of the hypothalamic hormone. Most interestingly, three sequential GnRH discharges, with a period and an amplitude apparently similar to those generated by the hypothalamus of the adult, were elicited from the brain of prepubertal monkeys by the sequential administration of three injections of NMA at hourly intervals. Taken together these findings demonstrate that the apparent dormancy of hypothalamic GnRH neurons, which is characteristic of prepubertal development in higher primates and underlies the protracted delay in the onset of puberty in these species, may be readily terminated by application of a generalized neural excitation. Plasma FSH, PRL, GH, and cortisol concentrations were also monitored during the course of some of these experiments, and release of each of these four hormones was observed after the iv injection of NMA (15 mg/kg BW).\r"

  ".W": "In a previous report, a consistent hypoprolactinemic effect of p-tyramine was observed in male rats under several experimental conditions in vivo. In the present experiments the action of p-tyramine on PRL release in vitro, or after challenge with different hyperprolactinemic drugs (serotonin, morphine, and TRH) was tested. Furthermore the participation of octopamine, a metabolite of tyramine, was evaluated with regard to the hypoprolactinemic action of the amine. P-Tyramine inhibited PRL release from hemipituitaries incubated in vitro at doses of 10(-4) and 10(-6) M (inhibition to 31% and 59% of control values, respectively). When tested for its ability to displace [3H]spiperone binding in vitro to a crude fraction of anterior pituitary membranes it was found that it did not compete with the D2 receptor labeled by [3H]spiperone, even at the concentration of 10(-4) M. P-Tyramine (40 mg/kg) antagonized the elevation of serum PRL levels by morphine, serotonin, and TRH. On the other hand, octopamine, which is formed from tyramine, also inhibited high PRL values found after stress, though the effective dose was higher than that of tyramine. Pretreatment with diethyldithiocarbanic acid, which inhibits conversion of p-tyramine to octopamine, did not modify the effect of tyramine in stress. The present results indicate that tyramine can inhibit PRL release due to certain drugs, by acting directly at the pituitary level. It does not displace [3H]spiperone binding from anterior pituitary membranes, and octopamine which lowers PRL release itself, cannot account for the effect of tyramine.\r"

  ".W": "Guanine nucleotide and Mg2+ ion regulation of [125I-Tyr10]monoiodoglucagon ([125I]MIG) binding to liver plasma membranes from chicken, rat, and rabbit was studied. It was found that [125I]MIG binding to chicken liver membranes was increased by the addition of Mg2+ ion, while binding to rat and rabbit liver membranes was unaffected. In the chicken liver membranes, the Mg2+ ion induced high affinity binding which was sensitive to guanine nucleotides, while the low affinity binding in the absence of Mg2+ ion was not. Maximal effects of Mg2+ ion were observed at 1 mM. Glucagon binding to rat liver membrane receptors was GTP sensitive regardless of whether Mg2+ ion was added. Glucagon binding to rabbit liver membranes was insensitive to both Mg2+ ions and GTP. This lack of GTP effect was not due to degradation of GTP; no effect of the nonhydrolyzable analog guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate was observable. Glucagon stimulation of rabbit liver adenylyl cyclase, however, was dependent on GTP, as was the case with all of the other liver adenylyl cyclases studied here. The Kact of GTP for the rabbit liver system was very similar to that for rat liver membranes. The glucagon receptor was covalently labeled with [125I]MIG using p-hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzoate and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. In all cases, a major labeled band at 63,000 daltons was observed. The levels of glucagon receptor and stimulatory (Ns) and inhibitory (Ni) regulatory proteins of adenylyl cyclase were measured. The highest levels of glucagon receptor were measured in rat liver membranes, while the levels in chicken and rabbit membranes were 30-40% lower. Rabbit liver membrane had the highest levels of Ns, while rat liver membranes had 2-fold lower and chick liver membrane 4-fold lower levels than rabbit liver membranes. The levels of Ni was similar in the three systems. Thus, the ratio of Ns to glucagon receptor was highest in the rabbit. In the rat, this ratio was 3-fold lower than that in the rabbit. In the chicken membranes, the ratio was about 60% of that in the rat. These data suggest that the observed differences in effects of GTP on hormone binding can be explained by alterations in the ratio of the receptor and Ns proteins among the various species.\r"

  ".U": "87190144\r", 
  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to have diverse effects on granulosa cells (GC). Although a potent mitogen for GC from several species, EGF attenuates many FSH-mediated processes associated with GC differentiation, suggesting that EGF promotes cell proliferation at the expense of cell differentiation. The extent to which EGF effects involve modulation of the FSH receptor level in proliferating GC has not been established. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of EGF on [125I]iodo-FSH binding by porcine GC isolated from small follicles maintained in monolayer cultures. Relative to cells cultured in medium with insulin alone, EGF treatment increased total monolayer [125I]iodo-FSH binding (per culture) 120% (P less than 0.005). This was due to a 40-50% (P less than 0.01) increase in binding per U protein and/or per U cell and a 40-60% (P less than 0.005) increase in both monolayer cell and protein contents. EGF stimulated GC hyperplasia, but not hypertrophy. Optimum EGF doses for increased total monolayer [125I]iodo-FSH binding and binding normalized per U protein or cell were 0.5 and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor was 20- to 100-fold less potent than EGF, and thrombin was without effect. Whereas [125I]iodo-FSH binding per U protein or cell was not affected by the serum concentration of the culture medium, the EGF effects on total monolayer binding and cell proliferation were directly related to the serum concentration (P less than 0.005). Thus, EGF-mediated increases in total monolayer [125I]iodo-FSH binding were paralleled by increases in cell number. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for [125I]iodo-FSH binding to cells cultured with and without EGF were 5.3 and 2.5 X 10(-10) M, respectively. Thus, EGF treatment significantly increased FSH receptor number, but significantly decreased receptor-binding affinity (P less than 0.05). Chronic FSH treatment during monolayer culture decreased total monolayer [125I]iodo-FSH binding and binding per U protein or per cell and attenuated EGF-stimulated cell proliferation, but markedly stimulated cell hypertrophy. Thus, concomitant treatment with EGF and FSH stimulated cell hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia. EGF and FSH each would appear capable of modulating the action of the other with respect to GC function. Our results indicate that EGF-mediated GC proliferation is associated with the expression of FSH-binding sites. This appears to be due to both an increase in FSH receptors among the cell population and an increase in the monolayer cell population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Binding studies indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites for VIP in rat lung membranes: 0.28 +/- 0.11 pmol/mg protein high affinity receptors (Kd = 79.2 +/- 26.4 pM) and 3.3 +/- 0.9 pmol/mg protein lower affinity receptors (Kd = 4.8 +/- 2.1 nM). Furthermore, binding of [125I]VIP to rat lung receptors was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of GTP analogs, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) GTP gamma S), and guanylylimidodiphosphate, suggesting that VIP receptors in rat lung membranes were tightly coupled to the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ns). Scatchard analysis of VIP binding in the presence of GTP gamma S revealed selective inhibition of binding to high affinity sites. A 58K band was specifically labeled when membranes covalently labeled with [125I]VIP were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The apparent size of this species was not altered when sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out in the absence of reducing agent. Unlabeled VIP inhibited the labeling, with an IC50 of about 1 nM. A related peptide, GH-releasing factor-(1-40)OH, exhibited a much lower binding affinity, and two unrelated peptides, insulin and atrial natriuretic factor, did not inhibit labeling of the 58K species, even at micromolar concentrations. Labeling of the 58K species was inhibited in a GTP gamma S-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of this species in the coupling to Ns. These data collectively indicated that the 58K species was a VIP-binding unit of VIP receptors in rat lung membranes. Several nondenaturing detergents were tested for extraction of labeled receptors from the membrane; the best extraction was obtained using 1% n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside.\r"

The binding in detergent extracts was characterized and shown to be similar or identical to that of OT receptors on intact plasma membranes. Solubilized receptors had a high affinity site (Kd approximately 2 nM) and a lower affinity component, whereas the membrane receptor has only the high affinity site. Several synthetic OT analogs inhibited [3H]OT binding in the same rank order in both solubilized and intact membrane preparations. Both solubilized and membrane-associated receptor required Mn2+ for [3H]OT binding. The concentration of OT-binding sites in solubilized extracts of uterine myometrium from rats in late pregnancy was substantially greater in uteri from rats in labor than in that from rats 2 days before labor, as we have seen previously with receptors on intact membranes. The affinity of the solubilized myometrial receptor (Kd approximately 5 nM) was comparable to that of the membrane-associated receptor. Binding of [3H]OT to solubilized extracts of intestinal smooth muscle, which is not a target for OT, was negligible. Gel filtration analysis on columns of Sepharose 6B indicated that the solubilized [3H]OT-binding component from mammary gland was present in multiple mol wt forms, but the smallest major form eluted with an average apparent mol wt of about 40,000. These studies indicate that CHAPSO-solubilized binding sites for [3H]OT are the same as those in intact membranes and, therefore, are components of the OT receptor.\r"

Recently, it has been shown that the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and TNF beta [also called lymphotoxin (LT)] produced by immune cells all stimulate osteoclast activity, whereas the lymphokine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) inhibits osteoclast activity stimulated by these agents. We report here the effects of each of these cytokines on bone collagen content measured as incorporation of proline into collagen and noncollagen protein in 20-day-old fetal rat calvariae. We found that IL-1, LT, and TNF decreased bone collagen synthesis and, to a lesser degree, noncollagen protein synthesis when the bones were exposed continuously to these agents. In addition, these cytokines stimulated DNA synthesis in the calvariae. In contrast to its action on bone resorption, where it opposed the resorptive effects of IL-1, TNF, and LT, IFN gamma inhibited bone collagen synthesis and had an additive effect with TNF and LT when bones were exposed to both. However, unlike the other cytokines, IFN gamma also decreased DNA synthesis in the calvariae. These data indicate that cytokines released by immune cells in the bone marrow microenvironment may work in concert to affect osteoblast activity in vitro.\r"

Neither a sodium-deficient diet nor an 8% NaCl diet started as early as 2 weeks of age altered this strain difference, although high dietary NaCl was associated with reduced atrial ANF concentration. In addition, no qualitative differences were found in the S and R ANF precursor, as assessed by 1) in vitro translation of atrial mRNA followed by immunoprecipitation of the ANF precursor and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 2) fractionation of S and R atrial extracts by reverse phase HPLC. These findings support the view that the S vs. R strain difference in atrial ANF concentration is more likely to arise from genetic control of regulatory phenomena than from alterations in the structural part of the ANF gene.\r"

To define the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, studies were carried out at subthreshold glucose concentrations (0-1.7 mM) in order to minimize any effects of LPX blockade on the potentiating effect of extracellular fuels. Barium chloride (Ba2+; 2 mM) increased 45Ca2+ release from prelabeled islets in Ca2+-free medium and, thus, is a model for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Inhibition of LPX (using nordihydroguaiaretic acid, BW755c [3-amino-1-(trifluomethyl-phenyl)2-pyrazoline] or butylated hydroxytoluene) did not have any consistent effect on the influx of Ba2+ (as assessed by 133Ba uptake) or on the consequent release of cellular Ca2+ stores; however, each LPX inhibitor vitiated Ba2+-induced I release. The LPX inhibitors were not merely acting as nonspecific antioxidants, since two inhibitors which do not act by scavenging hydroperoxides (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid) also impeded the effect of Ba2+ on I secretion; furthermore, a series of hydroxyl radical scavengers, reducing agents, or agents that block nonenzymatic and/or NADPH-activated lipid peroxidation did not inhibit I secretion. LPX inhibitors also blocked the residual I response to 16.7 mM glucose in Ca2+-free medium. Additionally, they reduced secretion induced by 46 mM K+ or 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (provided in the presence of extracellular Ca2+), without inhibiting K+- or isobutylmethylxanthine-induced Ca2+ fluxes. Stimuli sensitive to LPX blockade were also antagonized by antimycin A (an inhibitor of energy flux) or TMB-8 [8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride; which appeared to deplete critical intracellular Ca2+ stores]. In contrast, the effects of exogenous phospholipase C (and several other Ca2+-dependent membrane-active agonists) were resistant to the LPX inhibitors, TMB-8, and antimycin A; thus, LPX inhibitors are not nonspecific global poisons of all Ca2+-dependent exocytotic hormone release. We conclude that LPX (or a very similar enzyme) may modulate the effects (or redistribution) of an ATP-dependent trigger pool of Ca2+ at a site distal to and independent of its mobilization by primary islet agonists. LPX inhibitors also blocked secretion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate; this effect may reflect an effect of LPX on the activation of protein kinase C or a modulation of its synergism with the same trigger Ca2+ pool(s).\r"

There was a statistically significant increase in PRL response at all time intervals after TRH between the NL and AN/IN groups compared with the group with LPD on the basis of repeated measures analysis (P = 0.0013). There was no statistical difference in the TSH response between these three groups. Although the PRL response was statistically different, individual PRL response patterns were not diagnostic. It appears from these data that there is an increased PRL secretion in infertile women who have histological evidence of a LPD.\r"

Two different studies were performed. In one study, 15 subjects were treated with OT or saline; in the other study, 20 women were tested with TRH alone or in combination with OT. Results during follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases were similar. OT did not produce any effect on basal serum TSH and PRL levels and on the TRH-stimulated TSH secretion, whereas it significantly enhanced the PRL response to TRH. At all examined phases during the menstrual cycle, the mean peak PRL response was reached within 20 minutes after TRH injection, and the peak was about three times higher than basal value when TRH was given alone and about four times when OT was present. These data suggest that in normal women OT is not involved in the control of basal and TRH-stimulated TSH secretion and of basal PRL release. In contrast, the enhancement of the TRH-induced PRL release suggests that OT plays a role in the control of the acutely stimulated PRL secretion. Because results were similar regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen and/or progesterone do not appear to be involved in the effect of OT on the TRH-induced PRL release.\r"

Ten women were studied in two successive cycles. In the first cycle they received infusion of saline or naloxone (2 mg intravenous bolus followed by 1.6 mg/hour) for 9 hours, in random order on days 5 and 6 of the cycle. In the second cycle each woman was treated with CC (100 mg) for 5 days before study on day 6. In each study, blood samples were collected at 15-minute intervals for 9 hours; during the last hour 10 micrograms GnRH was given to test the pituitary response. After CC, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency was accelerated, and mean serum LH, serum follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol increased, but the pituitary response to GnRH was unchanged. These changes are best explained by an increase in activity of GnRH neurons. Conversely, naloxone had no effect on LH pulsatility or the pituitary response to GnRH. This indicates that the action of CC at least during the early follicular phase is exerted primarily at the levels of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator and does not depend on the activity of opiate neurons.\r"

The same response was present in spontaneously ovulating women but was absent in the hypogonadotropic hypogonad patients, despite the gonadotropin therapy's efficiency. In conclusion, when the alteration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone synthesis and/or release is reversible, the opioid system actively participates in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.\r"

  ".W": "The device known as \"Determine; The OvuTest\" (Ventco Medical Trading Company, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was appraised for its stated function of determining the optimal time for human conception by detecting the presence of the protein, uteroglobin (UTG), in cervical mucus. Twenty volunteers used the device daily through three cycles in which ovulation was indicated by rise in basal body temperature and/or elevated levels of luteinizing hormone. No correlation was found between the instrument readings and time of ovulation. When tested in vitro, it did not distinguish the presence of UTG. When vaginal flushings, containing cervical mucus, were analyzed for UTG by double immunodiffusion, no lines of precipitation were observed. We conclude that \"Determine; The OvuTest\" does not identify the approximate time of ovulation and therefore is not a reliable aid to conception. It does not detect UTG, and periovulation cervical mucus does not contain UTG.\r"

  ".W": "Monitoring of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) treatment for induction of ovulation according to either preovulatory estrogen levels or the presence of a dominant ovarian follicle was found insufficient to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHS). In 65 infertile patients treated with hMG and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a possible correlation between the number and size of all ovarian follicles on the day of assumed ovulation and the occurrence of OHS was evaluated in order to assess the value of ultrasonography in predicting OHS. It was found that patients with OHS had significantly more follicles at the time of hCG than patients without OHS. Mild OHS was characterized by the presence of eight to nine follicles, 68.7% of which were of intermediate size (9 to 15 mm). In moderate to severe OHS 95% of the preovulatory follicles were less than 16 mm, most of them (54.7%) less than 9 mm in diameter. It can be concluded that a specific preovulatory follicular configuration characterizes mild and severe hyperstimulation. This is important information before hCG administration and emphasizes the value of ovarian ultrasonography in predicting OHS.\r"

Twelve of 26 subjects who had at least three cycles tracked showed two different abnormalities, and 1 subject had three different abnormalities in five abnormal cycles.

In an effort to determine the treatment-independent pregnancy rate, we retrospectively reviewed the first 245 couples enrolled in the IVF-ET program at Duke University Medical Center. There were 19 treatment-independent pregnancies in 18 women and 3 treatment-associated pregnancies in cycles in which the oocyte retrieval was canceled (in 2 women washed intrauterine insemination was substituted for oocyte retrieval). Six pregnancies were established after an unsuccessful attempt at IVF-ET with additional non-IVF-ET therapy, including washed intrauterine insemination in three couples, and donor insemination in two couples. These observations suggest that a significant number of treatment-independent pregnancies will occur in couples clinically deemed appropriate for IVF-ET, pregnancies can be established in cycles of controlled hyperstimulation without oocyte retrieval, and additional non-IVF-ET therapy can result in pregnancy despite failure of IVF-ET in selected couples.\r"

In group A, 10 patients were given follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), FSH was continued until the criteria for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration were satisfied. In group B, 10 patients received Buserelin (0.3 ml twice a day subcutaneously) for 14 days to induce pituitary desensitization. Stimulation with FSH was then started, and Buserelin treatment was continued until hCG administration. In the second study, patients were included if they had had at least two previous attempts at ovarian stimulation that failed to reach the stage of follicular aspiration. Ovarian stimulation was conducted with a combination of Buserelin and human menopausal gonadotropin. Use of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in in vitro fertilization increased the number of oocytes collected, the fertilization rate, the length of the luteal phase and the pregnancy rate. The GnRH agonist also contributed to a generally better ovarian response in patients whose estradiol production had previously responded poorly to conventional ovarian stimulation protocols.\r"

In no case was serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration reduced in FRP-treated rats. After 75 days of treatment, there was a significant decrease in the number of the sperm head counts. After 60 days of treatment, the length of the dark zone of the tubule was longer than that of control. Pregnancy rates for FRP-treated rats were reduced after 45 and 60 days of treatment.

Our objective in this study was to compare the effects of levonorgestrel and a GnRH analog on serum cholesterol levels in rhesus monkeys being treated for surgically induced endometriosis. A high dose of levonorgestrel significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol during a 12-week treatment period. Levonorgestrel had no significant effects on the concentration of LDL/VLDL cholesterol or the percentage of total cholesterol in the HDL fraction. Conversely, the GnRH agonist had no significant effect on total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL/VLDL cholesterol, or the percentage of HDL cholesterol. Because the concentration of HDL cholesterol is closely correlated with atherosclerotic risk, this factor should be weighed in the overall risk/benefit analysis for the patient with endometriosis.\r"

The occurrence of endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surges was monitored by daily blood sampling. Forty-six cycles (42%) showed an endogenous LH surge. Instead of canceling the treatment cycle as other programs do, we proceeded to oocyte collection when the surge was detected. Human chorionic gonadotropin was administered routinely to the \"surge\" patients as soon as the LH surge was determined. The oocyte collection was carried out around 24 hours after the \"surge\" blood had been drawn, although the beginning of the endogenous LH surge was unable to be pinpointed. Significantly more immature oocytes, lower fertilization rate, and lower cleavage rate were seen in the \"surge\" patients than in the \"nonsurge\" patients. In five \"surge\" cycles laparoscopy for oocyte collection was canceled, but none was canceled because of premature ovulation detected by the immediately preoperative ultrasonography. In four \"surge\" cycles no potentially fertilizable egg was recovered. This was not significantly different from that of the \"nonsurge\" group. The pregnancy rate of the \"surge\" group (4/41 or 9.8% per laparoscopy and 4/34 of 11.8% per embryo transfer) was not statistically different from that of the \"nonsurge\" group (7/61 or 11.5% per laparoscopy and 7/56 or 12.5% per embryo transfer). This study presents the possibility of proceeding to oocyte collection, fertilization, embryo transfer, and pregnancy in patients with endogenous LH surge in in vitro fertilization procedures with the use of human menopausal gonadotropin treatment.\r"

Four hundred fifteen patients (788 cycles) with two ovaries and 86 patients (162 cycles) with one ovary were stimulated with gonadotropins starting on day 3 of the cycle for multiple follicular development. Although the mean number of preovulatory oocytes per laparoscopy and per transfer was significantly higher (2.33 versus 1.67 and 2.28 versus 1.99, respectively) in patients with two ovaries than in those with one ovary, the pregnancy rates per transfer were almost identical in the two groups (24.4% with two ovaries, 23.9% with one ovary). Results are presented according to different stimulation protocols and different age groups. It is concluded that although fewer fertilizable oocytes may be recruited from patients with one ovary, the potential for achieving a pregnancy is no different from that of patients with two ovaries.\r"

The cytosolic free [Ca2+] in islet cells incubated with nonstimulatory concentrations of glucose (30 mg/dl) ranged from 54 to 64 nM. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (1 mM), glucose (300 mg/dl) rapidly increased the cytosolic free [Ca2+] to a level of 90-110 nM. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, glucose failed to increase the cytosolic free [Ca2+], which remained at a level of 55-60 nM. Somatostatin inhibited glucose-induced increases in cytosolic free [Ca2+] in a dose-dependent manner (maximal inhibition was 34%). Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 10(-9) M somatostatin, which correlated well with somatostatin binding to islet cells (Kd = 2.6 X 10(-10) M). Potassium (50 mM) rapidly increased the cytosolic free [Ca2+] to 110-120 nM, and its effect was not influenced by the presence of somatostatin. Forskolin (20 microM) and dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) rapidly increased cytosolic free Ca2+ both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. More than 80% of the overall increase in cytosolic free-Ca2+ levels could be accounted for by the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Somatostatin effectively blocked the forskolin effect (32% inhibition) but not the dibutyryl cAMP-induced effect. Somatostatin appears to inhibit secretagogue-induced increases in cytosolic free [Ca2+] by interfering with cAMP production and probably with Ca2+ transport across the cell membrane.\r"

ICAs were determined by 24 laboratories according to a standard protocol based on the conventional indirect-immunofluorescence technique on cryostat sections of human pancreas. In addition, these 24 laboratories had performed any of 8 modifications of the assay. Test samples were titrated to end point, and the results obtained with the different methods were compared with those obtained by the standard protocol. The remaining 2 laboratories used either exclusively pancreatic sections of monkey instead of human as substrate (lab 23) or applied immunohistochemical staining (lab 22). By following the standard protocol, interlaboratory concordance was greater than 90% for the presence or absence of islet cell antibodies in 7 of the 13 samples circulated. However, a wide variability of titers was recorded, ranging from negative to 128. Of the modifications, prolonged incubation in the presence of aprotinin was performed by 10 laboratories and was found to improve the sensitivity in 57 of 70 (81%) determinations with samples that had been ICA positive by the standard protocol. Improved sensitivity was also noted by 2 laboratories with sections of monkey pancreas. Acetone-fixed sections, used by 6 laboratories, or a two-color immunofluorescence method, applied by 3 laboratories, did not change the titers in 27 of 35 (77%) and 14 of 25 (56%) determinations with samples that had been ICA positive by the standard protocol. In contrast, heat inactivation of the samples before testing, performed by 5 laboratories, resulted in a decrease in titers in 25 of 39 (64%) determinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When bovine renal Na+-K+-ATPase is reacted with glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of 10(-8) M concentrations of AL 1576 or 10(-6) M concentrations of a second aldose reductase inhibitor, sorbinil, glucosylation occurs. Whereas sorbinil has no effect on ATP hydrolysis by the glucosylated Na+-K+-ATPase, 10(-8) M AL 1576 causes a shift in the kinetics of hydrolysis of ATP from substrate inhibition to normal substrate activation. The aldose reductase inhibitors interact with the enzyme at the low-affinity ATP-binding site.\r"

Pentagastrin dosage (0.1 microgram/kg X h) was set to give about half-maximal response, to detect either inhibition or further stimulation of gastric secretion, whereas the dose of bombesin was chosen to give maximal gastrin but less than maximal acid secretion. Serum gastrin and somatostatin were also measured. In all subjects tested, bethanechol produced no effects on acid, gastrin, or somatostatin release but increased pepsin output. By contrast, bombesin inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated acid output in all 6 normal men by an average of 55%, whereas it inhibited acid output in only 2 of the 9 men with duodenal ulcer. Serum gastrin increases after bombesin in duodenal ulcer were three to four times greater than in normals. Although bombesin stimulates acid only by releasing gastrin, we postulate that bombesin may also simultaneously limit acid and pepsin secretion and speculate that this effect could be mediated by bombesin-induced somatostatin release. The cause for differences between duodenal ulcer and normal remain speculative.\r"

However, although natural killer cells have been demonstrated in the gut mucosa of rodents, recent reports found little or no spontaneous cytotoxic activity in the lamina propria of the human gut. Using the natural killer cell-related monoclonal antibody NKH-1, which has not previously been applied to studies of mucosal killer cell function, we have shown by immunofluorescence that 2%-3% of enzymatically dispersed lamina propria lymphocytes are NKH-1+. A \"panning\" technique was then used to enrich for the NKH-1+ cells. Panned cells were consistently greater than or equal to 80% NKH-1+ by indirect immunofluorescence. Unlike their counterparts in the peripheral blood, the mucosal NKH-1+ cells were Leu-11-. Although unseparated lamina propria lymphocytes failed to exhibit natural killer activity against K562 targets in 4-h chromium release assays at effector to target ratios of up to 100:1, the NKH-1+ cells were cytolytically active at ratios of less than 5:1. Mucosal lymphocytes depleted of natural killer cells (NKH-1-) exhibited cytotoxic activity when cultured for 72 h with interleukin-2. The precursors of the lymphokine culture activated phenomenon were NKH-1-, Leu-11-, T4-, T3-, T11+, and T8+. Although lamina propria T3+ cells did not exhibit spontaneous or culture activated cytotoxicity, they were shown to exhibit nonspecific anti-CD3 (anti-T3)-induced T-cell cytotoxicity. In conclusion, functional natural killer and lymphokine activated killer cells are both present in the human gut mucosa and represent distinct populations of cytotoxic cells. In addition, anti-CD3-induced cytotoxicity is a feature of mucosal T cells. These mucosal killer cell subsets differ phenotypically from those previously described in the peripheral blood.\r"

While concanavalin A-stimulated and recombinant interleukin 2-stimulated production of interferon-gamma in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis was significantly decreased when compared with that of controls (518 +/- 189 and 729 +/- 195 units per ml, mean +/- S.D.), there was also a lot of overlap. Addition of indomethacin to the cultures partially restored interferon-gamma production in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, indicating that suppressor function of monocytes was, in part, responsible for the diminished interferon-gamma production. Serial studies showed that interferon-gamma production rose during acute deterioration of illness, during treatment with interleukin 2 and with the improvement of clinical course. Interferon-gamma production was not different among hepatitis B e antigen or antibody positive, and non-A, non-B patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Our findings suggest that diminished interferon-gamma production is associated with disease severity in chronic liver disease, irrespective of the hepatitis B virus carrier state. It would be interesting to compare the efficacy of treatment with interferon-gamma or interferon-gamma inducers such as interleukin 2 in chronic hepatitis B patients with and without decreased in vitro interferon-gamma production.\r"

Therefore, this aspect of red blood cell (RBC) Na metabolism was studied in black men with newly diagnosed, untreated essential hypertension (NEH) and a normotensive control group. RBC Na content, Na+-K+ pump number (ouabain binding sites), and pump activity were measured. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for any of these three parameters. However, a group of previously treated essential hypertensive subjects (PEH) who had been withdrawn from therapy in the preceding 6 weeks were also studied. This group differed significantly from the NEH subjects in regard to all RBC Na+-K+ pump parameters. Their RBC Na content (10.27 +/- 3.23 vs 7.77 +/- 2.52 mmol Na/LRBC; p = 0.006) was higher, and their Na+-K+ pump activity (166 +/- 50 vs 221 +/- 87 nmol inorganic phosphate/mg membrane protein/hr; p = 0.03) and Na+-K+ pump number (213 +/- 40 vs 284 +/- 85 binding sites/RBC; p = 0.001) were lower compared with those in NEH subjects. Although the PEH subjects were older and somewhat less hypertensive than their NEH counterparts, these factors were not found to influence the Na+-K+ pump parameters. These results indicate that chronic diuretic therapy of patients with essential hypertension is associated with a reduced number of RBC Na+-K+ pumps. Since RBCs are not considered target cells for diuretics, the effects of these drugs on RBC electrolyte metabolism may occur at the time of erythropoiesis by the production of RBCs with fewer Na+-K+ pumps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This pressor effect induced by ANG II was abolished by simultaneous administration of ANF (3 micrograms/kg i.c.v.). In isolated strips of rabbit aorta preconstricted with ANG II (10 nM), ANF caused a dose-dependent relaxation. In intact rats, the increase in blood pressure following intravenously administered ANG II (0.1 and 1 microgram/kg) was not altered by the highest dose of ANF (20 micrograms/kg) given intracerebroventricularly. These results suggest that atrial peptides may play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure by interacting with both the central and peripheral actions of ANG II. Inhibition of the central pressor action of angiotensin by ANF appears to be independent of any direct peripheral effect of the atrial peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy or treatment with dexamethasone caused a 2.5-fold to threefold increase in both immunoreactive atriopeptin (AP) and AP messenger RNA (mRNA), primarily in left ventricular tissue. The combined treatments increased immunoreactive AP and AP mRNA more than either treatment alone. In the animals in which cardiac hypertrophy had been produced by abdominal aortic constriction, there was a decrease in atrial levels of AP and an increase in plasma levels of immunoreactive AP. The increase in left ventricular immunoreactive AP was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue from hypertrophied and/or dexamethasone-treated rats. The mRNA accumulated in the left ventricle was identical to atrial AP mRNA, as judged by transcriptional start site and by size on Northern blots. Because the mass of ventricular tissue is substantially greater than that of atrial tissue, the induced mRNA levels may represent a total abundance approaching one third of the total AP mRNA in the atria. High performance liquid chromatographic purification of ventricular extracts primarily demonstrated the presence of the high molecular precursor and small amounts of C-terminal peptide AP. Induction of ventricular AP (mRNA and peptide) may represent regression of the tissue to an earlier developmental form. These data provide a unique example of regulation of AP biosynthesis in nonatrial tissue.\r"

With a validated cytochemical bioassay that measures the capacity of biological samples to stimulate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in guinea pig proximal tubules as an indication of their capacity to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase, the mean glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-stimulating ability of the plasma of the 9-week-old Milan hypertensive rats and their normotensive controls was 586.0 +/- 88 and 23.4 +/- 8.3 U/ml (n = 7; p less than 0.001), while that of the 3-week-old Milan hypertensive rats (before the main rise in arterial pressure) and their normotensive controls was 99.9 +/- 27.4 and 7.8 +/- 1.8 U/ml (n = 7; p less than 0.001). With the use of a semiquantitative cytochemical assay that measures Na+,K+-ATPase activity directly, plasma from the adult hypertensive rats had a much greater capacity to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase than the plasma of the control rats. The significantly raised levels found in the young hypertensive rats before the main rise in arterial pressure are consistent with the hypothesis that the rise in the ability of plasma to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase is due to an inherited renal difficulty in excreting sodium.\r"

For this reason vascular ANP receptor density and affinity were examined in a model of volume-expanded hypertension, the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat. The density of mesenteric vascular ANP binding sites was decreased in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats from a control value in uninephrectomized rats of 203 +/- 25 fmol/mg protein to 60 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein (p less than 0.01). The sensitivity of norepinephrine-precontracted aorta to ANP was significantly reduced in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (p less than 0.001). DOCA-salt hypertensive rats infused intravenously for 4 days with ANP, 100 to 300 ng/hr, did not experience a lowering of blood pressure, in contrast to the significant reduction in blood pressure seen in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats similarly infused. In the latter there was no natriuretic response to ANP, while in the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats natriuresis occurred without lowering of blood pressure. In the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats plasma ANP concentration was increased to 68 +/- 8 fmol/ml from 10 +/- 1 fmol/ml in uninephrectomized rats. In conclusion, raised ANP concentration in plasma of volume-expanded hypertensive rats (DOCA-salt hypertension) may result in decreased density of ANP vascular receptors. These results suggest that a decrement in the number of ANP receptors may be a cause of decreased sensitivity of vascular responses to ANP in vitro and resistance to the blood pressure-lowering action of ANP in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not atrial natriuretic factor can act directly on the juxtaglomerular cell in vivo to inhibit hormone-induced renin release. To achieve this objective the interaction between synthetic atrial natriuretic factor and two different renin secretagogues was examined. To exclude any indirect effect of atrial natriuretic factor on renin release due to changes in sodium delivery to the macula densa, all studies were conducted in nonfiltering, canine kidneys. In one series of studies renin release was stimulated by intrarenal infusions of norepinephrine (3 micrograms/kg/min), and in a second series of studies renin release was induced by intrarenal infusions of prostacyclin (0.1 micrograms/kg/min). In both studies intrarenal infusions of atrial natriuretic factor (0.3 micrograms/kg/min), which provided supraphysiological levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the renal arterial plasma, failed to attenuate hormone-induced renin release. In contrast, adenosine, a well-known inhibitor of renin release, abolished the renin release response to both hormones. These data indicate that, at the dose used in this study, synthetic atrial natriuretic factor does not act directly on the juxtaglomerular cell to attenuate hormone-induced renin release. Further, these results imply that circulating endogenous atrial natriuretic factor cannot directly attenuate juxtaglomerular cell responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the regulation of salt balance and blood pressure is now widely recognized, and it would be extremely informative for both physiologists and molecular biologists to have mutants available that exhibit abnormal expression of this peptide hormone. The most direct mutation would affect the structural gene itself by altering either its coding potential or its regulation. With this aim in mind, it is of considerable interest to accurately determine the chromosomal position of the ANF gene (Anf) in the mouse. This information would permit a comparison with known mutations and provide a means of screening for mutations at this locus. Using recombinant inbred mouse strains, we undertook the mapping of the mouse Anf gene and demonstrated linkage of the gene to the Friend virus susceptibility-1 (Fv-1) locus on chromosome 4. The mapping was performed using a restriction fragment length polymorphism extant between the two parental strains. No recombination event between Anf and the Fv-1 locus was evident in any of the 34 strains tested. The assignment of Anf to this region of chromosome 4 coincides with the reported position of the cribriform degeneration mutation, which includes in its phenotype an abnormal electrolyte distribution. We have, therefore, begun studying this mutation to determine whether a defect in ANF expression is the underlying cause of the phenotype. Thus far, we have found no major DNA rearrangement close to the Anf gene.\r"

We hypothesized that the carotid bodies and hilar nerve afferents, respectively, sense chemical and mechanical changes caused by unloading, hence carotid body-denervated (CBD) and hilar nerve-denervated ponies (HND) might demonstrate greater ventilatory responses when decreasing resistance. At rest and during treadmill exercise, resistance was transiently reduced approximately 40% in five normal, seven CBD, and five HND ponies by breathing gas of 79% He-21% O2 (He-O2). In all groups at rest, He-O2 breathing did not consistently change ventilation (VE), breathing frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), or arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) from room air-breathing levels. During treadmill exercise at 1.8 mph-5% grade in normal and HND ponies, He-O2 breathing did not change PaCO2 but at moderate (6 mph-5% grade), and heavy (8 mph-8% grade) work loads, absolute PaCO2 tended to decrease by 1 min of resistance unloading. delta PaCO2 calculated as room air minus He-O2 breathing levels at 1 min demonstrated significant changes in PaCO2 during exercise resistance unloading (P less than 0.05). No difference between normal and HND ponies was found in exercise delta PaCO2 responses (P greater than 0.10); however, in CBD ponies, the delta PaCO2 during unloading was greater at any given work load (P less than 0.05), suggesting finer regulation of PaCO2 in ponies with intact carotid bodies. During heavy exercise VE and f increased during He-O2 breathing in all three groups of ponies (P less than 0.05), although there were no significant differences between groups (P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ID of the arteries and veins ranged from 100 to 500 micron. PGF2 alpha, 0.3, 1, and 3 micrograms/kg, predominantly decreased ID on the arterial side in a dose-dependent manner but increased flow velocity 27-62%. Consequently, volume flow was kept relatively constant. With PGF2 alpha, Ta and Tv were decreased 18-41% and 4-15%, respectively. Prostacyclin, 2 and 4 micrograms/kg, uniformly dilated the ID of small arteries 9-16% but did not change small veins. With prostacyclin, flow velocity was unchanged or decreased, whereas volume flow was increased significantly, 27-32%. No significant changes of Ta and Tv were observed in response to prostacyclin. When both prostaglandins, PGF2 alpha and prostacyclin, were administered, they canceled each other with respect to the ID of small pulmonary arteries. Prostacyclin also prevented the PGF2 alpha-induced vasoconstriction of the pulmonary venous microcirculation.\r"

Lobar vascular resistance (LVR) was partitioned into pre- (Ra) and postcapillary (Rv) segments by venous occlusion with lobar blood volume changes monitored gravimetrically. Before COI, 5-HT produced transient, dose-dependent increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) of 43.8 +/- 4.8-123.0 +/- 8.5% (n = 22) and simultaneous decreases in lobar blood volume (5.5 +/- 0.5-8.2 +/- 0.6 g/100 g LLL) with nearly proportionate increases in Ra and Rv at each 5-HT dose. After the initial challenge to 5-HT, LLL's were treated either with saline (n = 7) or one of three chemically distinct cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

After indomethacin or meclofenamate treatment, the vasopressor response to graded doses of 5-HT was markedly potentiated as Ppa increased by 71.6 +/- 7.6-207.0 +/- 24.6%.

A question that is addressed in the present study is whether or not periodicity is an essential requirement for this mode of ventilation to occur. It was found possible to adequately ventilate anesthetized and paralyzed cats with volume excursions below the dead-space level using a random band-limited forcing. Experimental conditions were close to a constant flow variance (VARF) state, and arterial CO2 tension varied linearly as a function of the ratio of noise bandwidth and VARF. Periodicity per se did not appear to be a requirement for HFOV to occur, a result consistent with predictions of Taylor dispersion theory.\r"

  ".W": "Given the pH dependence of enzymes in general and the potential importance of a blood and alveolar gas composition dependency on the interpretation of changes in the hydrolysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) substrates by pulmonary endothelial ACE, we examined the influence of Pco2 and Po2 on the hydrolysis of a synthetic ACE substrate (benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline, BPAP) on passage through isolated rabbit lungs. Perfusate pH values of about 7.1, 7.4, and 7.9 were obtained by ventilating the lungs with gas containing different CO2 concentrations and Po2 values of approximately 110 and approximately 10 Torr were obtained by varying the concentration of O2 in the ventilating gas mixture. In the range studied neither acidosis nor alkalosis produced any significant changes in BPAP hydrolysis or in the kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, for the hydrolysis process. On the other hand, a reduction in BPAP hydrolysis was detected when the Po2 was reduced from 110 to 10 Torr. The Vmax for BPAP hydrolysis by the lung was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the hypoxic vasoconstriction that occurred, suggesting that the reduced BPAP hydrolysis with hypoxia was due to the loss of perfused surface area due to the vasoconstriction. The results suggest that correlations between Pco2 and/or pH and whole-lung ACE activity that might occur in diseased lungs do not imply causalty. The hemodynamic consequences of changing Po2 (i.e., hypoxic vasoconstriction) may alter whole-organ ACE activity in the sense of changing the perfused surface area (i.e., the amount of ACE in contact with flowing perfusate).\r"

To determine the site of margination and the kinetics of neutrophil transit through the pulmonary microvasculature, we infused fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled canine neutrophils into the pulmonary arteries of 10 anesthetized normal dogs and made fluorescence videomicroscopic observations of the subpleural pulmonary microcirculation through a window inserted into the chest wall. The site of fluorescent neutrophil sequestration was exclusively in the pulmonary capillaries with a total of 951 labeled cells impeded in the capillary bed for a minimum of 2 s. No cells were delayed in the arterioles or venules. Transit times of individual neutrophils varied over a wide range from less than 2 s to greater than 20 min with an exponential distribution skewed toward rapid transit times. These observations indicate that neutrophil margination occurs in the pulmonary capillaries with neutrophils impeded for variable periods of time on each pass through the lung. The resulting wide distribution of transit times may determine the dynamic equilibrium between circulating and marginated neutrophils.\r"

Physiol. 53:483-489, 1982) has demonstrated that adequate alveolar ventilation can be maintained during apnea in anesthetized dogs by delivering a continuous stream of inspired ventilation through cannulas aimed down the main-stem bronchi. Because an asymmetric distribution of ventilation might introduce ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality, we compared gas exchange efficiency in nine anesthetized and paralyzed dogs during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) and conventional ventilation (intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, IPPV). Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. During CFV at 3 l X kg-1 X min-1, lung volume, retention-excretion differences (R-E*) for low- and medium-solubility gases, and the log standard deviation of blood flow (log SD Q) increased, compared with the findings during IPPV. Reducing CFV flow rate to 1 l X kg-1 X min-1 at constant lung volume improved R-E* and log SD Q, but significant VA/Q inequality compared with that at IPPV remained and arterial PCO2 rose. Comparison of IPPV and CFV at the same mean lung volume showed a similar reversible deterioration in gas exchange efficiency during CFV. We conclude that CFV causes significant VA/Q inequality which may be due to nonuniform ventilation distribution and a redistribution of pulmonary blood flow.\r"

In vivo reflectance spectrophotometry indicated that cortical b-type cytochromes (564 nm) were highly resistant to reduction by CN in the presence of O2 but showed reduction responses to the administration of 1-5% CO in 90% O2. In contrast, cyanide-sensitive cytochromes aa3 (605 nm) and c + c1 (551 nm) did not increase their reduction levels during exposure to 5% CO in 90% O2. The in vivo CO-mediated b-cytochrome reduction responses did not occur after pretreatment with the cytochrome b inhibitor, antimycin A. Transmission spectrophotometry of superfused hemoglobin-free rat brain slices confirmed cortical b-type cytochromes to be CN-resistant in the presence of O2. Another cytochrome absorbing at 445 nm also was resistant to reduction by 1-mM cyanide in vitro, but it could be reduced anaerobically. The reduced 445-nm cytochrome bound CO in the presence of cyanide. We postulate that this CN-resistant CO binding component might account for in vivo cytochrome aa3-CO interactions and directly or indirectly modulate cytochrome b reduction responses to CO. In any event, the spectral data indicate different primary tissue target sites for CO and CN in living rat brain and also suggest different bioenergetic consequences of exposure to the two agents.\r"

Radiolabeled microspheres were used to measure cardiac output (Q) and tissue blood flows in preexercise and at 3-5 min of treadmill exercise at 4.8, 8.0, 11.3, 14.5, and 17.7 km/h. All pigs (n = 8) attained maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) (60 +/- 4 ml X min-1 X kg-1) by the time they ran at 17.7 km/h. At VO2max, 87% of Q (9.9 +/- 0.5 l/min) was to skeletal muscle, which constituted 36 +/- 1% of body mass. Average total muscle blood flow at VO2max was 127 +/- 14 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1; average limb muscle flow was 135 +/- 17 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1. Within the limb muscles, blood flow was distributed so that the deep red parts of extensor muscles had flows about two times higher than the more superficial white portions of the same muscles; the highest muscle blood flows occurred in the elbow flexors (brachialis: 290 +/- 44 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1). Peak exercise blood flows in the limb muscles were proportional (P less than 0.05) to the succinate dehydrogenase activities (r = 0.84), capillary densities (r = 0.78), and populations of oxidative (slow-twitch oxidative + fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic) fiber types (r = 0.93) in the muscles. Total muscle blood flow plotted as a function of exercise intensity did not peak until the pigs attained VO2max, although flows in some individual muscles showed a plateau in this relationship at submaximal exercise intensities. The data demonstrate that blood flow in skeletal muscles of miniature swine is distributed heterogeneously and varies in relation to fiber type composition and exercise intensity.\r"

To shorten inspiratory muscles, functional residual capacity (FRC) was increased and maintained for 2-3 min at a constant level (range of increase 160-1,880 ml) by creating negative pressure within a tank respirator in which the subjects slept. Minute ventilation was maintained in all subjects over the entire range of increased FRC (mean change +/- SE = -3 +/- 1%) through preservation of tidal volume (-2 +/- 2%) despite slightly decreased breathing frequency (-6 +/- 2%). The decrease in frequency (-13 +/- 2%) was due to a prolongation in expiratory time. Inspiratory time shortened (-10 +/- 1%). Mean inspiratory flow increased 15 +/- 3% coincident with an increase in the slope of the moving time average of the integrated surface diaphragmatic electromyogram (67 +/- 21%). End-tidal CO2 did not rise. In two subjects, control tidal volume was increased 35-50% with CO2 breathing. This augmented tidal volume was still preserved when FRC was increased. We concluded that the compensatory response to inspiratory muscle shortening did not require factors associated with the conscious state. In addition, the potency of this response was demonstrated by preservation of tidal volume despite extreme shortening of the inspiratory muscles and increase in control tidal volumes caused by CO2 breathing. Finally, the timing changes we observed may be due to reflexes following shortening of inspiratory muscle length, increase in abdominal muscle length, or cardiovascular changes.\r"

We have measured, in the anesthetized cat, CO2 output (VCO2) and oscillations in arterial pH. The pH signal was differentiated to give the maximum rate of fall of pH on the downstroke of the oscillation (dpH/dt decreases max). Since oscillations in pH are due to oscillations in arterial PCO2, dpH/dt decreases max was considered to be equivalent to the maximum rate of rise of the PCO2 oscillation. VCO2 was increased by ventilating the intestines with CO2 and by the intra-arterial infusion of 2,4-dinitrophenol. VCO2 was decreased by filling the intestines with isotonic tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine buffer. The maximum range of VCO2 covered was 7.8-51 ml/min, and the mean range was from 13.6 +/- 1.3 to 29.7 +/- 1.6 (SE) ml/min. Although CO2 loading produced a small rise and CO2 unloading a small fall in mean PaCO2, the changes were not statistically significant, so that overall the response was close to isocapnia. Over the limited range of VCO2 studied there was a highly significant linear association between dpH/dt decreases max and VCO2 which supports the contention that the slope of the upstroke of the PaCO2 oscillation is determined by the CO2 flux from mixed venous blood to alveolar gas. As such this slope is a potential chemical signal linking ventilation to CO2 production.\r"

Breathing was irregular for several minutes before continuous breathing (greater than or equal to 40 min-1) began 6 +/- 1 min after cord occlusion (n = 10). Arterial PO2 rose significantly from 18 +/- 2 mmHg before occlusion and was 115 +/- 15 mmHg immediately before cord release at 15 or 30 min. Breathing continued even during high-voltage electrocortical activity. Cord release caused the breathing rate to decrease from 77 +/- 13 min-1 during the last 5 min of cord occlusion to 5 +/- 3 min-1 10 min after cord release (P less than 0.002; n = 7). Results indicate the change from placental to lung gas exchange can occur in the absence of sensory and thermal changes normally present at birth and that the transition is reversible.\r"

Since there are reports of an age-related decrease in the ratio of bioactivity to immunoreactivity (B/I ratio) for LH, we used a newly available bioassay for FSH to assess age-associated changes in the bioactivity and B/I ratio of FSH in man. Thirty-nine healthy men (23 young and 16 elderly) had single blood samples drawn. In addition, a subset of these men (12 young and 13 elderly) underwent frequent blood sampling for 24 h, both before and after 7 days of clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. Hourly blood samples from the 24-h sampling were pooled, and these, along with the single samples, were assayed for FSH by an in vitro bioassay system, using estrogen production by immature rat granulosa cells as the end point, and by RIA. Baseline single sample mean FSH, as measured by bioassay, was similar in young and elderly men [386 +/- 98 (+/- SEM) and 342 +/- 77 ng/mL, respectively]. Baseline mean FSH, measured by RIA, was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in elderly men (234 +/- 31 ng/mL) than in young men (122 +/- 12 ng/mL). The baseline FSH B/I ratio based on single sampling was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in elderly men (1.4 +/- 0.2) than in young men (2.7 +/- 0.3). In the men given CC and sampled for 24 h, mean bioactive FSH levels increased significantly in both the young (1180 +/- 282 ng/mL) and the elderly (992 +/- 227 ng/mL; P less than 0.01 for both values compared to baseline). Mean FSH by RIA also increased to similar levels in these young (217 +/- 34 ng/mL) and elderly (258 +/- 45 ng/mL) men. The FSH B/I ratio was 4.8 +/- 0.8 in young and 4.7 +/- 1.1 in elderly men after CC administration. We conclude that serum bioactive FSH levels are similar in elderly and young men, suggesting that the age-related decline in testicular function in man cannot be explained by a chronic deficiency in FSH stimulation; elderly men have a lower serum FSH B/I ratio than young men, which may reflect changes in the circulating form of FSH with aging; and administration of CC to young and elderly men increases both bioactive and immunoreactive serum FSH, implying preserved hypothalamic-pituitary responsiveness in the elderly.\r"

The results indicate that the luteolytic process, as reflected by an exponential decline of both serum estradiol and progesterone levels, began at least 64 h before the onset of menses. During estradiol and progesterone withdrawal, there was a selective increase in mean serum FSH levels (P less than 0.001) beginning 24 h before and reaching a peak 24 h after the onset of menses. The frequency of LH pulses increased slightly but not significantly during this period, with a significant rise in mean serum LH levels on the day of menses. Thus, an acute rise in FSH concentrations the day before and in LH concentrations the day after the onset of menses occurs during luteal-follicular transition. The dissociation of FSH and LH secretion observed suggests that additional neuroendocrine events other than changes in pulsatile GnRH secretion may be operative during this period. These findings indicate that the initiation of folliculogenesis for the ensuing cycle occurs during the late luteal phase by a process of selective augmentation in FSH secretion independent of hypothalamic GnRH secretion. This event may ultimately prove to be a manifestation of the action of recently characterized ovarian peptides on FSH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Labeled methyltrienelone was used to determine androgen receptor (AR) levels in cultured pubic skin fibroblasts in 40 infertile men with primary seminiferous tubule disorders and 18 normal men. LH pulse patterns and mean serum LH levels were also determined by blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h. The infertile men and the normal men had similar mean receptor levels [mean, 28.1 +/- 2.0 (+/- SEM) and 24.8 +/- 1.8 fmol/mg protein, respectively]. However, 5 men with chromosomal disorders had a higher mean AR level (41.3 +/- 6.2 fmol/mg protein) than the normal men, and 5 of the remaining infertile men (14.2%) had receptor levels that were less than the minimum value in normal men. In men with idiopathic oligospermia, 19.0% had low receptor levels. Although mean serum FSH and testosterone levels were similar in the infertile men with low AR levels and in the normal men, mean LH levels were significantly elevated in this group (7.1 vs. 3.6 IU/L), the higher values being a result of increased LH pulse amplitude (mean, 5.6 vs. 2.8 IU/L). The LH-testosterone product (an index of androgen resistance) was also elevated in these men. When infertile men with low AR levels were matched with infertile men with normal receptor levels, the mean LH values were significantly elevated in the former, as was the LH-testosterone product. Testosterone values were similar in the two groups of men. After excluding subjects with chromosomal disorders, there were no significant correlations between AR levels and other indices of androgen action, such as semen volume, seminal fructose, or sex hormone-binding globulin levels. We conclude that AR levels are higher in patients with severe testicular failure associated with X-chromosome disorders. Also, AR defects were found in 19.0% of infertile men with idiopathic oligospermia. Finally, elevation of mean LH levels in men with seminiferous tubule disorders may reflect resistance to androgen action.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of increasing the frequency of pulsatile GnRH administration on LH and FSH responsiveness were studied in five GnRH-deficient men who had achieved normal sex steroid levels during prior long term GnRH replacement. Intravenous doses of GnRH were employed that had previously been demonstrated to produce LH and FSH levels in each subject similar to those in normal men. Both acute and chronic changes in pituitary responses were studied after progressive increases in GnRH frequency (from every 120 to 60 min, from 60 to 30 min, and from 30 to 15 min) during three 12-h admissions, each separated by 7 days. During the two intervals between the studies GnRH frequency was 60 and 30 min, respectively. Pituitary responses were characterized by determining the mean serum LH and FSH levels, LH pulse amplitudes, and mean LH and FSH levels which were normalized for the frequency of GnRH administration (nLH and nFSH). As the frequency of GnRH stimulation was increased acutely, mean serum LH levels rose progressively, in contrast to both LH pulse amplitude and nLH levels which decreased, while serum testosterone (T) concentrations remained constant. No further evidence of gonadotroph desensitization occurred after chronic GnRH administration at either 60- or 30-min intervals. At higher frequencies of GnRH stimulation, discrete pulses of LH were not always apparent after injections of GnRH, and in two men, marked destabilization of the gonadotroph responses occurred. Even without detectable LH pulses, serum T levels did not decline during administration of GnRH at intervals as rapid as 15 min. In contrast, there was no change in mean FSH concentrations, although nFSH values decreased progressively as the GnRH frequency was increased. nFSH levels fell to a greater degree than nLH after each increase in GnRH frequency. Thus, pituitary gonadotroph responsiveness to a fixed dose of GnRH decreased as the frequency of GnRH stimulation increased. FSH responsiveness decreased to a greater degree than did LH. Gonadotropin secretory responses are destabilized at higher frequencies of GnRH administration. Pulsatile LH stimulation of the testes does not appear necessary to maintain T secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Serum glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit levels were determined in 165 patients with pituitary adenomas. Elevated serum alpha-subunit levels were found in 17 patients (acromegaly, 5 of 58; prolactinoma, 6 of 56; nonfunctioning adenoma, 5 of 32; and ACTH-producing adenoma, 1 of 19), most of whom had normal serum TSH and gonadotropin levels. When TRH (0.5 mg) was injected iv in the 6 prolactinoma patients with elevated serum alpha-subunit levels, serum PRL and alpha-subunit levels increased in only 1 patient. Four acromegalic patients with high serum alpha-subunit levels received TRH; serum GH and alpha-subunit increased in 1 patient and did not change in 2, and only serum GH increased in the remaining patient. Oral administration of bromocriptine (5 mg), on the other hand, consistently decreased serum alpha-subunit and PRL levels in 2 patients with prolactinoma and alpha-subunit and GH levels in 1 acromegalic patient. When serum from 3 patients was subjected to Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, immunoreactive alpha-subunit eluted in a single peak, which emerged in fractions corresponding to [125I]TSH alpha. Concanavalin A (Con A) affinity chromatography revealed that the major portion of immunoreactive alpha-subunit was retained to Con A. A pituitary adenoma removed at surgery from a patient with acromegaly was studied in monolayer cell culture. Secretion of both alpha-subunit and GH from cultured adenoma cells was stimulated by TRH and suppressed by dopamine in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemistry of the pituitary adenomas removed from patients with prolactinoma and acromegaly who had high serum alpha-subunit levels demonstrated alpha-subunit-containing cells as well as PRL- or GH-containing cells. These results suggest that elaboration of glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit occurs without concurrent production of glycoprotein hormones in a substantial number of patients with pituitary adenomas and that alpha-subunit responses to stimuli in such adenomas are generally parallel with those of the concomitantly produced hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in acutely castrated males of several species have demonstrated that testosterone (T) alone, given in doses that produce normal plasma T levels, can maintain normal plasma FSH and LH levels. This suggests that a nonsteroidal factor from the seminiferous tubule is not required to regulate FSH release, and raises the possibility that Leydig cell function may not be fully normal in oligo- or azoospermic men with increased plasma FSH levels. To clarify this, we studied T production rates in 11 sexually mature, infertile, but otherwise healthy men who had increased plasma FSH and normal plasma LH, T, and estradiol levels and in 9 normal men. Although individual plasma T and LH levels in the infertile men were within the normal ranges, the mean plasma T level of the infertile men was significantly lower (P less than 0.002), and the mean plasma LH level was significantly higher (P less than 0.002) than values in the normal men. The infertile men also had significantly lower plasma free T concentrations (P less than 0.005), while sex hormone-binding globulin and estradiol levels were similar to those of the normal men. The production rate of T in the infertile men was half that in the normal men (P less than 0.001). We conclude that T production is significantly reduced in infertile men who have a selective increase in plasma FSH. Because of the known role of Leydig cell sex steroids in the negative feedback control of FSH, this finding may explain the elevated plasma FSH concentrations characteristic of men with germ cell loss without the need to postulate a deficiency of a separate seminiferous tubule factor.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) induced the expression of the MHC class II antigens HLA-DR and -DQ on 1- to 2-week-old thyrocytes from normal thyroid tissue and thyroid tissue from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease; it also enhanced the expression of B2-microglobulin, which is associated with MHC class I molecules. However, the expression of thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antigen (McAg) was not detected after IFN gamma stimulation. Autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells had the same ability as IFN gamma to induce antigen expression when cocultured with thyrocytes. In contrast, leucoagglutinin (LAG) induced McAg as well as HLA-DR and B2-microglobulin expression on thyrocytes, but not thyroglobulin expression. Concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen also induced McAg expression. The time course of LAG induction of McAg was not always correlated with that of HLA-DR. Anti-IFN gamma, antiinterleukin-2 receptor, and anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies inhibited LAG or peripheral blood mononuclear cell induction of HLA-DR expression, but not LAG induction of McAg expression. Anti-HLA-DR reduced the IFN gamma induction of HLA-DR. INF gamma enhanced thyrocyte McAg expression induced by LAG, especially when thyrocytes were incubated with IFN gamma for 24 h before LAG stimulation. In contrast, in the absence of LAG stimulation, IFN gamma suppressed already present spontaneous McAg expression. TSH did not induce McAg and HLA-DR expression on DR-negative thyrocytes, but enhanced weak DR expression induced by other stimulants, e.g. IFN gamma or lectins. These data suggest that in vitro induction mechanisms of MHC class I and II antigens and McAg are different; MHC antigens are induced by IFN gamma, whereas McAg is induced by lectin, probably acting on thyrocytes directly; and IFN gamma has an enhancing effect on LAG-induced thyrocyte McAg expression.\r"

One man who had acute urinary retention before treatment was subsequently able to void extremely well. In a second man the symptoms of prostatism diminished but in the third urinary frequency and nocturia persisted in spite of a reduction in prostatic size, presumably because his symptoms were due to renal insufficiency.\r"

Plasma levels of both atriopeptin immunoreactivity (APir) and the NH2-terminal fragment of the prohormone immunoreactivity (NTFir) were very high in the fetus (4 and 20 times the maternal plasma, respectively). However, the atrial content of the AP was low, but surprisingly, ventricular content of AP was quite high (relative to the adult) in the fetus and fell postnatally. Atrial AP messenger RNA (mRNA) increased with postnatal age, whereas ventricular mRNA was extremely high in the fetus and fell rapidly after birth. High fetal plasma peptide levels may derive from the mother since infusion of exogenous atriopeptin 24 into the mother resulted in parallel increases in fetal and maternal peptide levels. Fetal plasma APir and NTFir levels partially reflect the markedly reduced total renal metabolic capacity compared with that of the adult. Plasma levels fell progressively after birth; whereas neonatal atrial content rose substantially. Plasma AP and NTF were simultaneously elevated in both the maternal and fetal circulation after vasopressin injection of the mother. The fetus can also respond to exogenous stimuli (vasopressin or indomethacin--presumably via ductal closure) and promptly release substantial amounts of peptide into its circulation. Thus, it appears that the AP hormonal system is functional during fetal life and responds avidly to increases in intracardiac pressure as does the mature animal.\r"

To examine the role of Ca2+ and protein kinase C activation as determinants of change in F-actin content of neutrophils, we used the NBD-phallacidin extraction assay to compare the kinetics and extent of change in F-actin content of cells activated with fMLP, the calcium ionophore A23187 or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). All stimuli increase the F-actin content in a dose-dependent manner; however, the rate of increase is slower and the maximum F-actin content is less for calcium ionophore and PMA than for fMLP-activated cells. The A23187-induced increase in F-actin content, but not that of fMLP, depends upon external free [Ca2+]. In A23187-activated cells, F-actin content increases at [Ca2+]free greater than or equal to 5 microM, is maximal at [Ca2+]free greater than or equal to 10 microM and is negligible at physiologic free [Ca2+] (10(-7)-10(-6) M). Combinations of PMA with A23187 or fMLP inhibit the A23187, but not the fMLP, activated actin polymerization. Comparison and combination of these activators shows that neither Ca2+-dependent activation with A23187 nor activation with PMA alone or in combination mimic the fMLP-induced changes in cytoskeleton organization of neutrophils.\r"

Growth of such vessels requires local endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. Inhibition of synovial EC proliferation, therefore, would have the potential to diminish rheumatoid inflammation. We have, therefore, studied the effects of gold sodium thiomalate (GST), auranofin, and gold chloride on the proliferation of human umbilical vein EC. GST suppressed both basal and EC growth factor-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation into EC in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition was observed with concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml GST, 5 micrograms/ml gold chloride, and 0.1 microgram/ml auranofin, levels attainable in blood and synovium of patients. These results suggest that gold compounds have an antiangiogenic effect. The low concentrations inhibiting EC proliferation suggest that gold compounds may suppress rheumatoid synovitis by reducing the number of small blood vessels available for mononuclear cell infiltration and synovial tissue proliferation.\r"

Two metabolic sequelae of hyperglycemia in diabetic nerve, sorbitol accumulation via aldose reductase, and (Na,K)-ATPase deficiency related to myo-inositol depletion, were explored as possible underlying causes of acute paranodal swelling in the spontaneously diabetic bio-breeding rat. 3 wk of insulin replacement, or therapy with an aldose reductase inhibitor or myo-inositol completely reversed paranodal swelling in sural nerve fibers after 3 wk of untreated insulin deficiency. These observations suggest that insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia cause reversible paranodal swelling, and ultimately poorly reversible axo-glial dysjunction, via the myo-inositol-related (Na,K)-ATPase defect rather than by the osmotic effects of sorbitol accumulation within nerve fibers.\r"

In particular the development of lipoxygenase inhibitors is prompting intense interest in their possible role as anti-inflammatory agents in psoriasis and other dermatoses. Because of the potency of these and other classes of new anti-inflammatory drugs, careful monitoring of their pharmacokinetics in individual patients, especially those at risk for adverse reactions, will prove necessary, especially in the early stages of treatment. Meanwhile, currently available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have a limited but significant place in the treatment of certain dermatoses. Current experience of the high incidence of adverse reactions to existing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suggests that this will be no less a problem with new agents under development. The skin is frequently involved in adverse reactions to this class of drug, and past experience suggests that cutaneous reactions are among the earliest unwanted side effects reported in a new drug of this type. The dermatologist, therefore, has an important responsibility to observe, document, and report such \"early warning signs\" to the appropriate licensing authority and the manufacturer.\r"

Nineteen of twenty-three patients who were on placebo discontinued treatment because of lack of response compared to only five of twenty-three astemizole-treated patients (p less than 0.0001). Fourteen of twenty-two astemizole-treated patients and two of twenty-two placebo-treated patients considered the results to be good or excellent (p less than 0.0001). Blinded assessment by the investigators yielded similar results (p less than 0.0001). Therapeutic response was the same in patients with and without angioedema in addition to urticaria and in those requiring corticosteroids. Duration of urticaria also did not influence the results. Increased appetite and weight gain were the main side effects reported more frequently in the astemizole-treated than in the placebo-treated group, and no significant toxicity was noted. Follow-up after terminating the drug study indicated a high frequency of remissions during the subsequent year.\r"

To quantify the proportion of atrial alpha-myosin heavy chain in various types of left atrial overload and to assess the possible relation between this proportion and atrial size, 34 patients were studied, 4 with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, 29 with various types of mitral valve dysfunction and 1 with an atrial septal defect. Four normal autopsy hearts were also studied. The proportion of alpha-myosin heavy chain among total (alpha plus beta) myosin heavy chains was determined in each atrial sample, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The size of the left atrium was assessed by one- and two-dimensional echocardiography. Alpha-myosin heavy chain was the main isoform present in the normal atria (85.5 +/- 9% of total myosin heavy chains). Patients with pure tight mitral stenosis (n = 9), mitral stenosis plus mild regurgitation (n = 8) and severe mitral regurgitation (n = 8), who had a higher indexed left atrial transverse diameter than those with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (33 +/- 6, 39 +/- 10 and 46 +/- 5 versus 19.5 +/- 2 mm/m2, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively), also demonstrated a much smaller percent of alpha-myosin heavy chain content (28 +/- 20, 23.5 +/- 13 and 12 +/- 10 versus 58 +/- 18%, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten atopic subjects with asthma participated in a blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. The EAR was inhibited by salbutamol and SCG but not by beclomethasone dipropionate or placebo (p less than 0.01). The LAR (p less than 0.01) and the allergen-induced increased bronchial responsiveness to histamine 7 hours (p less than 0.01) and 30 hours (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 for various comparisons) were inhibited by SCG and beclomethasone diproprionate but not by salbutamol or placebo. The allergen-induced LAR and associated increased responsiveness are now believed to be more important clinically than the EAR. The clinical relevance of these results is to stress the importance of the prophylactic nonbronchodilator drugs (SCG and steroids) and the potential inadequacy of bronchodilators used alone in the treatment of both perennial and seasonal allergic asthma.\r"

The children had four allergen inhalation tests on 4 different days, at least 14 days apart. On days 1 and 4, saline placebo was inhaled 1 hour before the expected onset of LAR, and FEV1 was measured hourly until FEV1 returned within 10% of baseline value; then methacholine challenge was performed. On days 2 and 3, 20 and 40 mg of cromolyn was inhaled double blind 1 hour before the expected onset of LAR. FEV1 and methacholine responsiveness were measured as on days 1 and 4. The two doses of cromolyn significantly delayed the LAR onset without altering the overall LAR magnitude and prevented the allergen-induced increase in methacholine responsiveness. Both these effects were greater at the maximal dose used. We conclude that cromolyn can prevent the allergen-induced increase in methacholine responsiveness and that this effect is not due to alteration in the magnitude of LAR. Our findings reveal a possible explanation of the effectiveness of this drug in the treatment of allergic asthma.\r"

  ".U": "87196312\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of T lymphocytes is initiated by receptor ligand interactions at the cell surface leading to the transduction of intracellular signals followed by the de novo synthesis and expression of T cell activation markers (including receptors for interleukin 2 (IL 2) and transferrin), production of lymphokines, and T cell proliferation. This requisite first step for activation of T lymphocytes can be mimicked in certain situations with a variety of stimuli. These include antibodies to certain integral membrane proteins, phorbol esters, and plant lectins that act as mitogens. In this paper, we report that at least two classes of human T cell clones can be distinguished based upon signal requirements necessary to induce proliferation. Although all clones analyzed expressed IL 2 receptors and secreted IL 2 after non-antigenic activation, one subset of clones did not proliferate in response to the same non-antigenic signals. In that subset, complete activation leading to proliferation required interaction of the T cell with specific antigen. The ability to subset these T cell clones into two groups did not correlate with phenotypic differences, source of the clone, nor with magnitude of intracellular calcium mobilization. By studying the stimulation requirements of these two subsets of human T cell clones through the use of specific antigen or antigen-independent stimuli, it was possible to demonstrate that different stimuli varied in their ability to induce steps of T cell activation. Analysis of reactivity of these clones to suboptimal stimulation allowed the definition of intermediate stages of T cell activation. Such intermediate stages might reflect a diversity of intracellular signaling pathways or a complexity of regulatory mechanisms distal to the events that allow intracellular calcium mobilization. Thus for the first time, it has been possible to study ordered events of T cell activation in non-transformed, antigen-dependent human T lymphocytes. The data presented in this paper suggest that T cell activation is not an all or nothing phenomenon, and there is an ordered sequence of events that can be differentiated based upon signal requirements at the T cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat was used to study arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. We demonstrated that Jurkat cells are able to convert AA into prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxanes. The presence of tritiated 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, PGA2 (B2), and thromboxane B2 in the culture medium was shown either by thin-layer chromatography after a 4-hr incubation period of [3H]AA-prelabeled Jurkat cells or by using specific radioimmuno assays. PG synthesis was inhibited by both indomethacin and niflumic acid, two cyclooxygenase inhibitors. AA metabolism through the cyclooxygenase pathway was followed during T cell activation. T cells were activated by lectins or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to trigger the T3-Ti complex and by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to mimic IL 1-dependent pathways. Our results show that lectins and anti-CD3 mAb both reduce the amount of PG released by the cells, whereas TPA did not. We confirmed that a combination of TPA and lectins or TPA and anti-CD3 mAb is necessary to obtain full activation of Jurkat cells if this event is monitored by using measurement of IL 2 synthesis. In addition, lectins and anti-CD3 mAb can be replaced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or niflumic acid. Indeed, a combination of TPA and one of these two drugs induced maximal IL 2 synthesis. These results thus suggest that a reduction in PG synthesis might be a prerequisite to allow the cascade of events involved in T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase C (PKC) has a major role in a ligand-receptor-mediated signal transduction system in a variety of cell types including T lymphocytes. One of the early phenotypic changes associated with T cell activation is the expression of cell surface receptors for interleukin 2 (IL 2). To test the role of PKC in regulation of IL 2 receptor (IL 2-R) expression and T cell activation in general, we used tumor promoters (TP) as modulators of PKC and compared their effects on intact human T cells and on the enzymatic activity of T cell-derived PKC in a cellfree system. In T cells, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced IL 2-R expression and proliferation associated with cytosol-to-membrane PKC translocation. A dose of TPA (1 to 4 ng/ml) that induced about 50% of the maximal activation of PKC in the enzymatic assay also induced half-maximal effects on cell proliferation, IL 2-R expression, and PKC redistribution in intact T cells. Structure-function studies with several phorbol ester analogs and non-phorbol ester TP directly correlated tumor promotion activity with the ability to activate PKC and induce IL 2-R. An inhibitor of PKC, chlorpromazine, was found to suppress TPA-mediated proliferation and IL 2-R expression, and inhibited T cell-derived PKC by competing with the phospholipid. Ca2+ ionophore, which synergizes with TPA in induction of T cell proliferation, facilitated the TPA-induced PKC translocation to the membrane. The results thus demonstrate a direct correlation between the effects of various chemicals on: subcellular redistribution of PKC in T cells; induction of T cell proliferation and IL 2-R expression; and activation of T cell-derived PKC in vitro. These data provide further support for the role of PKC in transduction of activation signals in T cells and in regulation of IL 2-R expression.\r"

In the human thymus, the T cell antigen receptor complex is reduced or absent on immature thymocytes, whereas the T11 glycoprotein is present at high cell surface density on all thymocytes. To determine whether activation through the T11 pathway induces similar or different changes in mature and immature thymocytes, we fractionated thymocytes according to their surface expression of the T3-T cell receptor (T3/Ti) complex. We report that two populations, one with high and one with low T3/Ti expression, can be activated through the T11 pathway to undergo nuclear activation and express IL 2 receptors. Moreover, in the absence of accessory cells, only the most mature population, expressing high T3 density, could be induced to proliferate, whereas the subset representing immature cortical thymocytes required accessory cells for proliferation. These findings suggest that the cellular microenvironment may have a critical role in regulating the activation of immature cortical thymocytes and that this cell population may not represent \"nonfunctional\" dead end cells, but rather a valid intermediate in human thymic differentiation.\r"

In contrast, mature medullary-type thymocytes (Lyt-2+ L3T4-, Lyt-2- L3T4+) were nearly devoid of cells expressing detectable surface Pgp-1. The appearance of peripheral Pgp-1- T cells was found to be thymus dependent, as demonstrated by the diminished proportion of Pgp-1- T cells after thymectomy and their virtual absence in athymic nude mice. The subsequent acquisition of surface Pgp-1 was found to be a stable differentiation event occurring concomitantly with primary antigenic stimulation; selected Pgp-1- mature T cells from thymus or periphery acquired constitutive expression of Pgp-1 after stimulation in vitro with alloantigen or mitogens. These observations were extended by studies in vivo showing that immunization with various antigens augmented the percentage of Pgp-1+ spleen cells within the Lyt-2+ subset. Furthermore, the frequencies of antigen-specific CTLp, after immunization by any of three different antigens tested, were greatly enriched in the Pgp-1+ compared with the Pgp-1- subpopulations. Peritoneal exudate Lyt-2+ cells, after a localized allograft rejection, demonstrated a particularly prominent Pgp-1+ subpopulation (78%) that contained virtually all the allospecific cytolytic activity. A model consistent with all of these data proposes that mature thymocytes lacking surface Pgp-1 upon emigration to the periphery acquire its expression at the time of primary antigenic stimulation. Hence, expression of Pgp-1 among peripheral T cells is an important differentiation marker for identifying antigen-stimulated memory T cells.\r"

We now report that the p150,95 glycoprotein is expressed by some cytotoxic T cell clones and that it is involved in cell-mediated cytolysis by these clones. Two CTL clones, clone JS-93 (CD3+ CD4+ CD8-) and clone JS-102 (CD3+ CD4- CD8+) expressed high levels of p150,95 and were shown to be specifically directed against HLA-DR and HLA-A2, respectively. Immunoprecipitations followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated no heterogeneity in the p150,95 molecule isolated from both clones. Furthermore, we demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (moab) directed against p150,95 could inhibit the cytotoxic activity of both clone JS-93 and clone JS-102 (50% and 47%, respectively). Single cell assays revealed the inhibition to occur at the level of conjugate formation rather than at the level of the lethal hit. Similar results were obtained with moab directed against LFA-1 (p170,95). The capacity of the moab directed against LFA-1 and p150,95 to inhibit CTL activity and conjugate formation were additive, resulting in a similar percentage of inhibition as found with moab directed against the common beta-chain of these molecules. It is concluded that at least some CTL clones express the p150,95 antigen at their cell surface, and that this molecule, like LFA-1, acts at the level of conjugate formation between effector and target cells.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-CD3 MAb can inhibit MHC-restricted cytolytic activity of CD3+ mature cytotoxic T cells. In particular effector-target cell combinations, however, anti-CD3 MAb enhance or induce cytolysis by cross-linking CD3+ effector and IgG-FcR+ target cells. Virtually all natural killer (NK) cells or NK cell-derived clones are CD3-4-8- but do express CD2 and CD16 (IgG-FcR) antigens. We have studied how these cell surface molecules are involved in the regulation of cytolytic activities. The addition of anti-CD2 MAb to effector and target cells was found to induce conjugate formation of the IgG-FcR+ target cells with the effector cell and nonspecific cytolysis of, for instance, the P815 mouse mastocytoma cells. Enhancement or induction of conjugate formation and cytolysis of IgG-FcR+, P815, U937, and Daudi cells was also accomplished by using anti-CD16 MAb (e.g., Leu-11c (B73.1) or CLB Fc-gran 1 (VD2) MAb). Some human and mouse tumor cell lines (K562, P815, and U937) appear to express distinct types of IgG-FcR, showing different affinities for distinct subclasses of MAb (e.g., IgG1, IgG2a), but another line (Daudi) expresses only one type of IgG-FcR preferentially binding IgG1 MAb. Here we demonstrate that IgG-FcR on the effector cells can act as activation sites because anti-CD3 as well as anti-CD16 MAb of IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses can induce lytic activity of target cells bearing the relevant IgG-FcR. These data demonstrate that induction of conjugate formation and cytolysis by MAb occur when the target cells bear IgG-FcR with \"specificity\" for those MAb. Thus, besides via CD3, cytolytic activity by mature T and NK cells also can be induced via the CD2 and CD16 antigens on these cells.\r"

The latter two antibodies recognized the same or spatially close antigenic determinant. The cross-blocking of anti-HLA Class I MoAb CR10-215 and CR11-115 by MoAb CR11-462 reflects neither its contamination by anti-HLA Class I antibodies nor its cross-reactivity with HLA Class I antigens. On the other hand, the cross-blocking appears to reflect redistribution of HLA Class II antigens by the MoAb CR11-462, since the MoAb CR10-215 and CR11-115 are not susceptible to blocking when lymphoid cells are treated with 0.025% glutaraldehyde or are coated with Fab' fragments of the MoAb CR11-462. Furthermore, immunoprecipitates from B lymphoid cells preincubated with the MoAb CR11-462 before solubilization contain HLA Class I antigens.

We investigated the effect of LPS on Ia expression in T cell deficient mice by using the congenitally athymic nude mouse model. Injection (i.p) of LPS into athymic (nu/nu) mice resulted in a dramatic increase in the expression and biosynthesis of Ia by peritoneal macrophages 7 days after injection. The magnitude and kinetics of this induction were equivalent to increases observed after LPS injection of euthymic (nu/+) mice. Viable Listeria monocytogenes also increased Ia expression in athymic mice, but in contrast to the induction observed in euthymic mice at 3 and 7 days after injection, increased Ia expression was not seen until 7 days. Ia induction by either LPS or L. monocytogenes in athymic mice was not due to the presence or development of mature T cell function as defined by assays for T cell mitogenesis and interleukin 2 production. We conclude that increased macrophage Ia expression by LPS and L. monocytogenes in vivo can occur in the absence of mature functioning T cells.\r"

In comparison, gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) increases Fc gamma R expression on both human monocytes and monocyte-like cell lines. In this study, we examined the combined effects of glucocorticoids and IFN-gamma on human monocyte expression of the high affinity (72 kDa) Fc gamma R. Mononuclear cells prepared from heparinized venous blood of normal donors were treated for up to 90 hr with or without recombinant IFN-gamma and/or steroids. Monocyte Fc gamma R were measured by Scatchard analysis of the binding of human monomeric 125I-IgG1; indirect immunofluorescence plus flow cytometry, utilizing a monoclonal antibody (MoAb 32) which is specific for the high affinity Fc gamma R; and direct immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled human monomeric IgG1 and flow cytometry quantitated using U-937 cells as a standard. Cultured monocytes incubated in the presence of both glucocorticoids and IFN-gamma for 18 hr had significantly higher (p less than 0.01) Fc gamma R levels than monocytes treated with IFN-gamma alone. The effect of combined treatment reached a plateau by 42 hr of incubation without increasing expression of other surface markers tested. Treatment with glucocorticoids alone did not consistently decrease monocyte Fc gamma R levels after either 18 or 42 hr of culture. Only glucocorticoids augmented the IFN-gamma increase in Fc gamma R; other steroids tested had no effect on IFN-gamma action. Furthermore, the effect was observed after treatment with only one type of interferon, IFN-gamma. These results describe a glucocorticoid immunoregulatory effect that may explain why combined IFN-gamma plus glucocorticoid treatment enhances mononuclear phagocyte Fc-mediated functions.\r"

This study examined the uveitogenic capacity of IRBP of another species, the monkey, and tested the cross-antigenicity between these two proteins by a battery of immunological assays. Monkey IRBP was found to be approximately 20 times less uveitogenic in Lewis rats than bovine IRBP. High levels of cross-reactivity between bovine and monkey IRBP were demonstrated by antibodies as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and by the radiometric ear test of delayed-type hypersensitivity, by using rats immunized with either one of the IRBP. On the other hand, lymphocytes from these rats failed to detect the cross-reactivity between the two IRBP by the proliferation response in culture. Yet, such lymphocytes did recognize the nonimmunizing IRBP when activated in culture for acquiring the capacity to adoptively transfer EAU into naive recipients. The data are discussed with regard to the limited usefulness of the lymphocyte proliferation assay for detection of immunopathogenic processes and the role of cross-reacting antigens in initiation of autoimmune responses.\r"

To determine whether anti-L3T4 could reverse as well as prevent murine lupus, we monitored a cohort of 30 B/W females until age 7 mo, when severe autoimmune disease was established, and then we examined the effects of weekly treatment with MAb to L3T4. The rate of target cell clearance by MAb was considerably slower in old B/W mice than it was in young B/W mice or in normal (BALB/c and C57BL/6) mice. Nonetheless, treatment with anti-L3T4 depleted 90% of circulating L3T4+ cells over 3 mo. In treated mice, the concentration of anti-DNA antibodies fell by 80%, renal insufficiency was reversed, and 1 yr survival was 75% compared to 17% in controls. These findings indicate that L3T4+ cells play an important role in perpetuating murine lupus in B/W mice even after severe disease is present. Because the L3T4 antigen in mice is homologous to the Leu-3/T4 (CD4) antigen in humans, these findings suggest that treatment with CD4 MAb may be effective in people with systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

We investigated the conditions under which murine astrocytes can become susceptible targets of cytotoxic T cells. We demonstrate that mouse astrocytes in vitro can be susceptible targets of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-specific cytotoxicity mediated by L3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Expression of appropriate class I MHC antigen on the astrocytes is a requirement, because only cells bearing the H-2d phenotype are susceptible to lysis by L3 cells. BALB/c-H-2dm2 astrocytes lacking the specific determinant recognized by L3 cells are not susceptible to lysis. Astrocyte lysis can, however, occur under culture conditions in which MHC antigen expression is immunocytochemically low or undetectable. Cytolysis can be inhibited by pretreatment of the effector L3 cells with either anti-Lyt-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-clonotypic mAb and by preincubation of the glial target cells with an appropriate anti-H-2 antibody (anti-H-2Ld). mAb to lymphocyte function-associated antigen does not inhibit cytotoxicity of the L3 clone against glial cells. Knowledge regarding the role of CTL within the CNS, including the surface molecules involved in glial cell lysis, could further the development of immunotherapies designed to effect immune reactivity within the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that the antibody to human myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) reacts with a subset of human mononuclear cells (MNC) mediating a natural killer (NK) activity. The properties of the target molecule of the anti-MAG antibody, however, have not yet been elucidated. Three (GC-J4, MC-P2, and MC-P4) of five murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to MAG bound to human MNC. Moreover, MC-P2 and MC-P4 inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled anti-Leu-7 to MNC in a dose-dependent fashion. Conversely, anti-Leu-7 inhibited the binding of MC-P2 and MC-P4 to MNC, but did not inhibit the binding of GC-J4. Therefore, it is possible that MC-P2 and MC-P4 bind directly to or close to the Leu-7 epitope, and that GC-J4 binds to the epitope which is distinct from the Leu-7 epitope. The electrophoretic patterns of immunoprecipitates with GC-J4, MC-P2 and anti-Leu-7 from detergent lysates of surface-labeled human MNC were very similar. The target molecules of anti-Leu-7 and anti-MAG mAb have apparent m.w. of 205, 170, 150, 135, 110, 85, 65, and 55 kDa. All of the molecules precipitated by these mAb are monomeric or noncovalently associated proteins, because the electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins remained unchanged whether the samples were reduced or not. MC-P4 may have a higher affinity for the 65 kDa molecule than the other mAb, and precipitates the 58 kDa molecule as well. Therefore, the fine antigenic specificity of MC-P4 is slightly different from those of anti-Leu-7 or MC-P2. The implication of these results is that mAb, whose specificity is directed to the carbohydrate part of human MAG, reacts with the Leu-7 reactive molecules on human MNC, and that at least two epitopes detected by anti-MAG mAb coexist on the surface molecules with various apparent m.w.\r"

The binding of recombinant murine IL 2 to these receptors did not stimulate CH12.LX cells to differentiate and secrete antibody. However, the binding of either of two monoclonal antibodies (Mab) specific for the IL 2 receptor increased the proportion of CH12.LX cells that secrete hemolytic IgM. The effect did not require the presence of antigen. One of the Mab, 3C7, is known to block the binding of IL2 to its receptor on T cells, whereas the other, 7D4, which also reacts with the IL 2 receptor, does not block the binding of IL 2. The differentiation of CH12.LX induced by 3C7, but not that induced by 7D4, was inhibited by recombinant IL 2. Neither IL 2 (up to 200 U/ml) nor 3C7 (up to 10 micrograms/ml) had any significant influence on incorporation of [3H]thymidine; 7D4 at 10 micrograms/ml decreased thymidine incorporation by about 60%. Mitomycin C and hydroxyurea, which both inhibit the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into CH12.LX cells, also both induce antibody secretion. In both cases, the concentration necessary to cause differentiation is substantially lower than that needed to cause detectable inhibition of thymidine uptake. We conclude that the IL 2 receptor on CH12.LX cells is a functional signal transducing molecule, and we discuss the possible inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation.\r"

Certain properties of the 5E2 antigen were similar to the murine TL and human T6 antigens.

  ".W": "Carbohydrate differentiation antigens (CT antigens) which previously had been shown to be associated with cytotoxic T cells were found at high levels on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and on the intestinal epithelium. Histological examination of intestinal sections demonstrated that the CT1 MAb defined epitopes on IEL and on epithelial cells located in the base of the villi crypts. The CT2 MAb reacted with IEL but also bound to the majority of cells in the intestinal epithelium. When isolated intestinal cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, two major size classes of cells were evident. The smaller cells, corresponding to lymphocytes, were primarily Lyt-2+, with a high proportion expressing CT antigens. Another differentiation antigen defined by the MAb J11d was absent from IEL, indicating that those IEL of T cell origin are likely to be mature because thymocytes, but not peripheral T cells, express the J11d antigen. Two-color fluorescence analysis indicated that the CT determinants were present on the Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, and the Thy-1-, Lyt-2+ subsets of IEL. However, the small percentage of L3T4+ IEL were CT-, further supporting our previous demonstration of a correlation between CT expression and Lyt-2 expression. Interesting phenotypic characteristics of IEL other than CT antigen expression were also detected. IEL did not express the MEL-14 lymphocyte homing receptor, and the cell surface level of LFA-1 was significantly lower than that of other peripheral lymphocytes. It was also shown that a small percentage of IEL express a T cell receptor allotypic marker, indicating that at least some of the cells are mature in terms of T cell receptor gene rearrangements. The large intestinal cells, although CT+, were not hematopoietic in origin because they were T200- and were shown by using chimeric mice not to be bone marrow-derived. In contrast to previously reported results, the cytotoxic activity of IEL was negligible with detectable lysis against NK-sensitive cells and other tumor cells, being observed in only one of seven experiments. Thus, the expression of the CT determinants was not indicative of cytotoxic ability, as previously suggested. The presence of specific carbohydrate residues on the cell surface of a subset of lymphocytes in an anatomically distinct immune compartment suggests that a unique differentiation pathway is followed by these cells.\r"

Whereas neutrophils incubated with either A23187 (0.4 microM) or PMA (1.6 microM) alone failed to release any 5-lipoxygenase arachidonate products, neutrophils incubated with both stimuli together for 5 min at 37 degrees C released LTB4 as well as 20-COOH-LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, 5-(S),12-(R)-6-trans-LTB4, 5-(S),12-(S)-6-trans-LTB4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. This synergistic response exhibited concentration dependence on both PMA and A23187. PMA induced 5-lipoxygenase product release at a concentration causing a half-maximal effect of approximately 5 nM in the presence of A23187 (0.4 microM). Competition binding experiments showed that PMA inhibited the specific binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) to intact neutrophils with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 8 nM. 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) also acted synergistically with A23187 to induce the release of 5-lipoxygenase products. 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate (PDD), an inactive phorbol ester, did not affect the amount of lipoxygenase products released in response to A23187 or compete for specific [3H]PDBu binding. PMA and A23187 acted synergistically to increase arachidonate release from neutrophils prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid but did not affect the release of the cyclooxygenase product prostaglandin E2. Both PMA and OAG, but not PDD, induced the redistribution of protein kinase C activity from the cytosol to the membrane fraction of neutrophils, a characteristic of protein kinase C activation. Thus, activation of protein kinase C may play a physiologic role in releasing free arachidonate substrate from membrane phospholipids and/or in modulating 5-lipoxygenase activity in stimulated human neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Isolates of HIV showed distinct differences in the ability to replicate in continuous human hematopoietic cell lines. Moreover, although all PMC cultures obtained from healthy individuals could be infected with HIV, considerable variation in the amount of virus released from different PMC cultures was observed. These biological properties of HIV could not be correlated with clinical state, binding properties of the virus isolates to target cells, or differences in target cell CD4 antigen expression. Some isolates of HIV that could not directly infect the HUT-78 cell line showed productive infection when PMC infected with these viruses were added to this human T cell line. These observations emphasize the importance of cell to cell contact in the spread of virus. The results demonstrate for the first time the differences in the host range specificity of HIV isolates in several individual PMC cultures, and indicate that the optimal isolation of HIV is achieved with normal human PMC rather than established human cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that immunization of mice with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing glycoprotein D of Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 will induce a variety of L3T4+ T cell responses. These included a HSV-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response, T cell help for the induction of antiviral antibodies, and the ability to eliminate a challenge dose of HSV from the pinna. This protection against a subcutaneous virus challenge was not mediated by the delayed-type hypersensitivity response because intravenous inoculation of the vaccinia virus recombinant expressing HSV-1-gD induced a state of split tolerance. Thus, mice could still clear a HSV challenge inoculum from the pinna yet were unable to mount a HSV-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Evidence is presented that suggests the protective response was, at least, in part mediated by a T cell-dependent induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies. Evidence is also presented that may suggest the failure of a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing HSV-1-gD to induce HSV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses appears to minimize the protective response to only efficiently clearing low 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose) challenge populations of virus. These findings are discussed with relevance to the immune control of HSV infections and to the future development of anti-HSV vaccines.\r"

Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that the P28 antigen was mainly located in the parenchyma of the schistosomulum and of the adult worm, including the dorsal spines of the parasite. Western blot analysis revealed that this antigen was present in three species of schistosomes: S. mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. bovis. The antibody response raised against this protein was able to kill S. mansoni schistosomula in in vitro cytotoxicity assays in the presence of rat eosinophils. The inhibition of this cytotoxic activity by an aggregated myeloma IgG2a indicated that one of the major isotypes involved in this in vitro model is IgG2a. The passive transfer of P28 antisera induced a significant level of protection against experimental infection. Moreover, we have immunized Fischer rats and BALB/c mice with the purified 28,000 dalton protein and observed a marked decrease (up to 70%) in the parasite burden in both experimental infection models.\r"

The phenazine pigment pyocyanine has been identified as one of the inhibitors present in cellfree culture supernatants. To determine the mechanism of the inhibitory action of pyocyanine, we studied its effect on the early stages of T cell activation. Pyocyanine inhibited lymphocyte stimulation induced by specific antigens, the lectin concanavalin A and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, suggesting that its inhibitory effect is not dependent on interference with the T cell antigen receptor complex itself. Using quin-2, we showed that pyocyanine did not interfere with the mitogen-induced increase in cytosolic-free Ca2+. We also showed that pyocyanine did not interfere with the function of calmodulin stimulated Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase activity, indicating that the mechanism of action of pyocyanine differs from that of the structurally related phenothiazine compounds. Analysis of IL 2 production and IL 2 receptor expression clearly showed that pyocyanine inhibits the production of this essential lymphokine as well as the expression of IL 2 receptors on the T cell membrane. This inhibition is dose dependent and not due to cellular toxicity. There was parallel inhibition of growth in cell volume as well as [3H]TdR uptake. Thus, our results demonstrate that pyocyanine inhibits T cell proliferation by decreasing the production of the critical lymphokine IL 2 and by decreasing the expression of the IL 2 receptor. Local suppression of lymphocyte stimulation by phenazine pigments such as pyocyanine may interfere with cellular immune responses that may be necessary for eradication of chronic infection with P. aeruginosa.\r"

Treatment of G arrested cultures of CT6 cells with recombinant IL 2 induces the rapid sequential expression of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-myc, and c-myb but does not affect the expression of several cytosolic or membrane-associated proto-oncogenes. A comparison of early genes induced by growth factor treatment of quiescent NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and CT6 cells demonstrated that only c-fos and c-myc induction is shared in the two different lineages. Factor-independent lines derived from CT6 cells show no mitogenic response to IL 2, yet binding of IL 2 with its receptor in the cells was capable of inducing the expression of c-fos and c-myc. In factor-independent cell lines, c-myc was uniformly expressed at high constitutive levels, suggesting that c-myc abrogates growth factor requirements of these cells. The levels of c-myc expression in the factor-independent lines was not due to an autocrine production of IL 2 but may be a consequence of constitutively activated IL 2 receptors.\r"

The cDNA hybridized to a single mRNA transcript of 1 kb in size the expression of which was restricted to T lymphocytes. The 182-amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA revealed a signal peptide, a 89-amino acid extracellular domain with one N-glycosylation site, a hydrophobic domain with a centrally located glutamic acid residue, and a 44-amino acid intracellular domain. Comparative analysis of the mouse T3 gamma sequence with those of the human T3 gamma chain and the related human and mouse T3 delta chains revealed that the regions incorporating the extracellular cysteine residues were highly conserved. More importantly, the mouse T3 gamma subunit retained the potential serine phosphorylation site (Ser 126) unique to the human T3 gamma subunit, in the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular domain. The 16-amino acid region flanking Ser 126 was totally conserved (100%) in the gamma subunits, yet showed little homology (38 to 44%) with the corresponding region in the delta subunits, in spite of the otherwise high degree of conservation (61 to 68%) between the remainder of the cytoplasmic domains of the gamma and delta chains.\r"

We therefore studied the possible involvement of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent kinase (C-kinase) in these phenomena. Quantitative assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation in unstimulated cells showed Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent kinase activity in the cytosol, but no comparable activity in the particulate fractions corresponding to membrane and cytoskeleton material. At concentrations of soluble anti-T3 that partially activate T cells in the absence of macrophages, there was a 50 to 60% decrease in C-kinase activity in the cytosol, with a comparable increase in activity in the membrane fraction. A similar transfer of activity was also induced with the known C-kinase activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, although redistribution was more rapid in onset, more complete, and more sustained. Redistribution of enzyme activity was additionally confirmed by qualitative assays of endogenous substrate phosphorylation. Labeling of intact cells followed by immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-T3 indicated signal-dependent phosphorylation of two components of the T3 complex and an unidentified 94,000 substrate that was resistant to reduction and alkylation. These findings are consistent with an important role for C-kinase in transduction of membrane events by the T3-Ti complex.\r"

  ".W": "High affinity receptors for interleukin 2 (IL 2) contain the Tac protein as one ligand-binding subunit. Localization of the IL 2-binding site on this molecule, as well as localization of the complementary site on IL 2, should provide insight into the design of IL 2 analogs. In this report, we examine the ability of normal and modified Tac protein to bind IL 2 and several antibodies that recognize the native Tac molecule. Using a transient L cell expression system, we have determined that transfection with cDNA-missing Tac exon 4 resulted in expression of spliced protein that had no measurable binding to IL 2 or the monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies, anti-Tac, and 7G7/B6. This protein was detected, however, by rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against synthetic Tac peptides. Thus, one or more amino acids encoded by exon 4 is important, either for direct ligand contact or for the proper folding of critical segments of the Tac molecule. In addition, insertion of stop codons at a unique restriction enzyme site near the beginning of exon 5 resulted in cellular secretion of truncated Tac molecules that were capable of binding IL 2, anti-Tac, and 7G7/B6. Amino acids encoded by exons 5 to 8 thus play no critical role in IL 2 binding. The ligand association demonstrated for truncated Tac protein produced by exons 2 to 4 should guide attempts to define the IL 2-binding segment of the Tac molecule.\r"

These Southern hybridization experiments included probes for the murine JH region as well as probes for the mu, gamma 3, gamma 1, gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and alpha switch regions. For 22 of the hybridomas, the deletion model of the heavy chain switch fits the data well--all switch regions upstream of the rearranged (and expressed) switch regions are deleted and all switch regions downstream remain in the germline configuration. As exceptions to a simple deletion model of the switch recombination, we have observed two, and perhaps three, examples of switch region rearrangements downstream of an expressed heavy chain gene. The 25 hybridoma DNA samples include 28 rearranged gamma switch regions; the sizes of at least 25 of these rearranged fragments are consistent with recombination in the tandemly repeated sequences associated with gamma genes. For those hybridomas with two spleen cell-derived Igh loci, including three mu-expressers, three gamma 3-expressers, four gamma 1-expressers, and one gamma 2b-expresser, the two loci tend to be rearranged to the same switch region, suggesting that the heavy chain switch rearrangement is an isotype-specific event. The exceptions within this group include three hybridomas in which the switch seems to be incomplete--on one chromosome the JH complex is rearranged to the S gamma 3 region, while on the other it remains associated with the S mu region. A second group of hybridomas, which includes four gamma 3-expressers, have both gamma 3 and gamma 1 switch rearrangements. Each of these four hybridomas includes three rearranged JH segments, suggesting that they may be the result of an unusual differentiative pathway or a technical artifact. These experiments suggest that the heavy chain switch rearrangement in normal spleen cells is a deletion event that occurs within tandemly repeated elements. The rearrangement is mediated by factors with partial, or perhaps complete, isotype specificity.\r"

By use of monoclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of the 155 kd alpha-chain of Mo1, two distinct functions of this glycoprotein have been identified. Mo1 serves as the receptor (CR3) for iC3b, one of the breakdown products of the third component of complement, and in addition appears to be involved in promoting cell-cell adhesion of granulocytes. In studies performed with a subline of the acute myelogenous leukemia tumor cell line KG1, we found cells from this subline (KG1m) incapable of iC3b-mediated binding despite these cells having surface Mo1. Five distinct epitopes on Mo1 identifiable on normal cells by a panel of anti-Mo1 alpha-chain monoclonal antibodies (including OKM10, thought to be identical to or close to the iC3b binding site) were equally present on KG1m by indirect immunofluorescence. The electrophoretic mobilities of both the alpha- and beta-chains of Mo1 derived from KG1m were identical to those isolated from normal granulocytes. To determine whether altered receptor mobility or decreased surface density of Mo1 was responsible for the lack of Mo1-related functions, binding to EiC3b of isolated Mo1 derived from KG1m lysate was measured. KG1m-derived Mo1 did not bind to EiC3b when compared with normal granulocyte-derived Mo1, suggesting that the lack of iC3b binding is not secondary to decreased surface receptor number or mobility. This subline of KG1 provides an excellent model for the study of the relationship between surface receptor structure and function.\r"

From 3 to 13 mo after grafting, the mononuclear cells repopulating the thymus grafts were stained with fluorescent monoclonal antibodies to thymocyte differentiation antigens, peanut agglutinin, and an antibody to MuLV antigens and were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Irradiated TRE of the Fv-1n/n genotype, whether from high or low leukemia-incidence strains, contained lymphoid cells of host (nustr/nustr) origin with alterations in thymocyte differentiation and MuLV antigen expression consistent with preleukemic changes. In contrast, transplanted TRE of the low leukemia-incidence Fv-1b/n genotype restricted preleukemic changes in thymocyte differentiation and MuLV antigen expression by lymphoid cells derived from the nustr/nustr host. Thus, nustr/nustr lymphocytes must infect susceptible TRE (Fv-1n/n) with N-tropic-MuLV before preleukemic changes occur in the mustr/nustr lymphocytes that later migrate to the thymus. Therefore, it was the radiation-resistant cells in the thymus that amplified or suppressed expression of AKR MCF retroviruses and the preleukemic phenotype, not the thymic lymphocytes. Thy-1.1+ splenocytes of ungrafted nustr/nustr mice were comparable in percentage to nustr/+ but were deficient in the Lyt-1+2- subpopulation and unresponsive to mitogens or alloantigens in vitro. Analysis of splenocyte cell surface markers, mitogen, MLC, and CML responses of Fv-1n/n-thymus-grafted nustr/nustr mice showed restoration of Lyt-1+2- cells to levels comparable to nustr/+ and reconstitution of in vitro proliferative and cytotoxic responses.\r"

Although NZB anti-BALB/c one-way mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC) generate anti-Qa-1b CTL, anti-Qa-1 CTL responses are not generated during BALB/c anti-NZB one-way MLC or during two-way MLC with NZB and BALB/c spleen cells. However, depletion of L3T4+ cells from the spleens of BALB/c mice before two-way MLC with NZB spleen cells resulted in anti-Qa-1b CTL responses. Likewise, the addition of anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-I-Ad mAb to two-way MLC with NZB and BALB/c spleen cells resulted in the generation of anti-Qa-1b CTL. Conversely, anti-Lyt-2 mAb inhibited the generation of anti-Qa-1 CTL. These data indicate that class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted cellular interactions are capable of suppressing the generation of Ia-unrestricted anti-Qa-1 CTL responses by Lyt-2+ responder cells. This model provides a novel opportunity to both characterize the cellular interactions responsible for regulating primary CTL responses to the Qa/Tla-encoded class I molecule Qa-1, and determine the contribution of this L3T4+ Ts-dependent defect in NZB mice to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is often assumed that anti-T cell antibodies mediate immunosuppression by targeting T cells for destruction, other activities should be considered. To dissect the mechanisms by which anti-L3T4 and anti-interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2R) monoclonal antibodies (Mab) mediate immunosuppression, the effects of anti-L3T4 and two complement-fixing anti-IL 2R Mab of the same isotype, but defining functionally distinct epitopes, were probed in a delayed type hypersensitive (DTH) model using BALB/c as well as two C5-deficient mouse strains. Low doses of anti-L3T4 and the M7/20 anti-IL 2R Mab, which competitively blocks IL 2 binding, inhibit DTH in BALB/c mice whereas an anti-receptor antibody which does not block the IL 2 binding site did not effectively abrogate DTH. Interestingly, anti-L3T4, but not M7/20 anti-IL 2 Mab treatment blocked DTH in the C5-deficient strains. On the other hand, M7/20 does not cause immunosuppression solely by blocking the IL 2R from occupancy by IL 2 because binding to T blasts by M7/20 is equivalent in BALB/c and C5-deficient strains. Consequently, immunosuppression mediated by anti-IL 2R Mab is dependent on both IL 2 receptor site blockade and C5. Clearly, anti-L3T4 and M7/20 have disparate requirements for C5 in mediating immunosuppression. There can be no doubt that factors other than the cellular targeting patterns influence the immunosuppressive activities of Mab. Ideally, anti-T cell Mab should fix complement and inhibit T cell function.\r"

It is shown that T cells from mice older than 18 mo of age are deficient with respect to their ability to express receptors for IgD after in vivo or in vitro exposure to IgD. Similarly, IFN-gamma induces T delta cells in young but not in aged mice. In contrast, T delta cells can be induced in aged mice with IL 2, although to a lower percentage than in young mice. In agreement with our previously reported findings, the current study demonstrates the immunoaugmenting effect of IgD injections on the antibody response in young mice. This effect is absent in aged mice and thus correlates with the failure of IgD to induce T delta cells in such animals.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of a variety of monoclonal antibodies to the CD5 (T, gp67) pan T cell differentiation antigen has been shown to potentiate T cell proliferation. In this paper we show that CD5 monoclonal antibodies cause increased intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in T cells. An increase in [Ca2+]i occurred within 1 min in indo-1-loaded PBMC after the addition of CD5 monoclonal antibodies and cross-linking with a second step anti-mouse kappa light chain antibody. Cross-linking of CD5 was effective when done directly on the cell surface or by the administration of preformed soluble complexes that contained CD5 antibodies. Calcium mobilization induced by suboptimal concentrations of CD3 antibodies was specifically augmented and sustained by CD5 antibodies, although the enhancement was modest in magnitude. When cell surface phenotype was correlated with calcium mobilization, it was found that the CD5 response was restricted to CD5+/CD3+ cells, and that approximately 90% of CD5+ cells had responded. CD5-induced calcium mobilization was found to differ from CD3 stimulation in that EGTA entirely ablated the CD5 response, whereas the CD3 response was resistant to EGTA, indicating that the CD5-induced increased [Ca2+]i is derived primarily or entirely from extracellular calcium. CD5-stimulated calcium mobilization also differed from CD3 in that the CD5 response was inhibited by pretreatment with phorbol myristate acetate, whereas the CD3 response was not, suggesting that depletion of protein kinase C causes an uncoupling of signal transduction between CD5 and calcium channels. Finally, experiments were done with T cells after antigenic modulation of the CD3 or CD5 molecules. Unexpectedly, both the CD5 and the CD3 responses were ablated on CD3-modulated cells, whereas only the CD5 response was ablated on CD5-modulated cells. In addition, several Cd5+/CD3- T cell leukemia lines also failed to respond to CD5 stimulation, providing further evidence which indicates that the CD5 response depends on the cell surface expression of CD3 or a CD3-associated structure. These findings suggest that one mechanism for CD5-induced augmentation of mitogen-stimulated T cell proliferation involves increased [Ca2+]i which is distinct from but interdependent with that induced by stimulation of the CD3 molecule.\r"

  ".W": "The 95 Kd CD19 antigen is the broadest lineage specific surface marker for B cells: it is present on the surface of virtually all B lymphocytes, including early B progenitor cells. In this study we have evaluated the function of the CD19 antigen by using the CD19 mAb HD37. Binding of HD37 mAb to B cells at low doses (0.5 microgram/ml) induced a strong inhibition of the proliferative response to anti-Ig. This inhibition was not mediated by the Fc portion of the antibody, since F(ab')2 fragments were as effective as the whole antibody. Both dose-response curve analysis and experiments in which a cross-linking second step anti-mouse antibody was added suggested that cross-linking of CD19 antigens was necessary for optimal inhibition. Early phases in B cell activation were affected by the HD37 mAb: it significantly reduced the number of cells that left G0 and entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle upon triggering with anti-mu. The increase in free intracellular ionized calcium [Ca2+]i that is induced by anti-mu was also consistently reduced by CD19 mAb. Cross-linking was also crucial for this effect, suggesting that a causal relationship may exist between the inhibition of anti-Ig-mediated [Ca2+]i fluxes and inhibition of proliferation. A variable but clear increase in [Ca2+]i levels followed cross-linking of CD19 antigens by specific mAb. This evidence suggests that CD19 molecules may function in the downregulation of B cell growth and proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that injection of mice with an affinity-purified goat antibody to mouse IgD (GaM delta) that stimulates polyclonal IgG1 secretion might also stimulate differentiation of B cells into IgE-secreting cells was suggested by the observation that such treatment induces T cells from those mice to secrete a lymphokine, B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1), that can stimulate both IgG1 and IgE secretion in vitro. Studies described in this paper show that injection of BALB/c mice with 200 to 3200 micrograms of GaM delta greatly increased the quantity of splenic epsilon chain-encoding mRNA, the number of spleen cells with cytoplasmic IgE, and the concentration of serum IgE 7 days after injection. Serum IgE levels obtained in these mice were approximately 100 times baseline levels and were comparable with those found in mice infected with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, but were approximately 2000-fold less than the peak serum IgG1 levels induced by GaM delta injection. Both IgE and IgG1 secretion in GaM delta injected mice were T dependent (blocked by anti-L3T4 antibody). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that BSF-1 may play a role in the in vivo stimulation of IgE secretion and provide an easy to apply model for the investigation of in vivo regulation of IgE responses.\r"

  ".W": "The T3-Ti complex appears to play a central role in the activation of T cells by antigens and mitogens. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a unique lectin which inhibits T cell proliferation induced by mitogens, but it also induces marked IL 2 production by peripheral blood T cells. The pattern of responses induced by WGA suggests that this lectin may use a different mechanism of T cell activation other than the mechanism employed by the common T cell stimulants. We first investigated the production of IL 2 by Jurkat cells (E6-1) stimulated with WGA, before and after modulation of the surface T3-Ti complex. IL 2 production was markedly reduced after modulation of the T3 antigen from the cell surface when these cells were stimulated with PHA. In contrast, little change was observed in WGA-induced IL 2 production after modulation. Furthermore, we examined the effect of WGA on a T3-mutant of E6-1 cells (T3.1) which does not produce IL 2 in response to PHA or PHA plus PMA. WGA-stimulated T3.1 cells produced a significant amount of IL 2 with or without added PMA. In addition, a small but consistent rise in intracytoplasmic free calcium was observed when these cells were stimulated with WGA. These results demonstrate the presence of an alternative mechanism of T cell activation independent of the T3-Ti complex.\r"

  ".U": "87196403\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that lymph node (LN) T cells from mice given repeated injections of anti-mu antisera from birth (mu sm) fail to mount secondary T proliferative responses to antigen in vitro after s.c. priming in vivo. This finding raised the possibility that priming of T cells in LN depends on the presence of B cells, Ig+ B lymphocytes being absent in mu sm. In support of this idea, the present paper shows that the priming defect in LN of mu sm can be largely overcome by injecting B cell populations s.c. 1 day before s.c. priming with antigen. Restoration of LN priming was observed with s.c. injection of highly purified populations of small B cells but not with heat-killed or lightly irradiated B cells. Homing studies indicated that approximately 10% of s.c.-injected B cells reached the draining LN. In other studies, irradiated mice injected i.v. with purified T cells manifested poor priming in LN after s.c. injection of antigen. It was reasoned that the LN priming defect in this situation reflected the lack of B cells in irradiated mice, B cells being highly radiosensitive. In support of this notion, it was found that s.c. injection of B cells into irradiated recipients of T cells led to high priming of T cells in LN after s.c. injection of antigen. Although T cells exposed to antigen in B-depleted LN of mu sm and irradiated mice gave negligible T proliferative responses in vitro, low but significant levels of primed T helper function were detected in a sensitive T helper assay in vivo. In light of this finding, our working hypothesis is that the initial induction of T cells to antigen in LN is controlled by resident dendritic cells (or other non-B antigen-presenting cells), the main role of B cells being to control the clonal expansion of activated T cells.\r"
