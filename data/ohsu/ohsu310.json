In 39, the pregnancy was terminated and the fetal tissues or mixed products of conception were examined for rubella virus. In 22, the pregnancy continued to term and cord serum was tested for specific IgM antibody. No evidence of intrauterine infection was found in 38 pregnancies in which the mother's rash appeared before, or within 11 days after, the last menstrual period. The shortest interval at which fetal infection occurred was when the rash appeared 12 days after the last menstrual period. All 10 pregnancies in which the rash appeared 3-6 weeks after the last menstrual period resulted in fetal infection: 4 of these pregnancies went to term, and all 4 infants were damaged. The risk to the fetus when rubella occurs before the mother's last menstrual period is probably negligible.\r"

The specimens were tested by an IgG capture and a competitive radioimmunoassay (GACRIA, COMPRIA). By GACRIA 211 subjects were anti-HAV positive and 358 anti-HAV negative on both serum and saliva. 10 other seropositive subjects had weakly positive saliva reactions. There were three discrepant results. For the population investigated HNIG use could be minimised at no extra cost by first testing the saliva of those greater than 40 years old, frequent or long-stay travellers, those born in HAV endemic areas, and those with a history of jaundice. Of the 51% of travellers tested for these reasons 20% were anti-HAV positive. They made up 76% of all those with antibody.\r"

To examine whether its monophosphate ester (ara-AMP) can be effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B when given in reduced dosage as a conjugate with lactosaminated human serum albumin (L-HSA), which selectively enters hepatocytes, five patients with chronic type B hepatitis (HBsAg/HBV-DNA positive for at least 2 years) were treated with the conjugate. The daily dose of conjugate given (35 mg/kg) contains 1.5 mg ara-AMP, whereas the usual daily dose of free ara-AMP is 5-10 mg/kg. In three patients HBV-DNA fell to undetectable levels and remained negative in two; in one of them anti-HBe developed. In the other two patients HBV-DNA decreased but was detectable during treatment--one received three cycles of therapy, and became HBV-DNA negative and anti-HBe positive 45 days after the end of treatment; the other remained HBeAg/HBV-DNA positive. No adverse effects were observed, and biochemical variables (including aminotransferases) remained unchanged or decreased with viraemia. No antibodies (IgM and IgG classes) that bound the conjugate were detected. Thus L-HSA-ara-AMP inhibits HBV replication as well as free ara-AMP but at a third to a sixth of the dose.\r"

A significant reduction in the immediate survival of patients with VF was seen when the protocol was changed (22% after the change, 43% before). Prior predictors of poor response were similar in each group, except for the number of witnessed arrests, delay until cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and occurrence of endotracheal intubation, but multiple logistic regression showed the use of adrenaline to be an independent predictor of outcome. Early high-dose adrenaline was associated with a reduction in immediate survival in patients with persistent VF.\r"

The relations between the patient's age and tumour kinetics, prognosis, oestrogen receptors, and environmental X-ray carcinogenesis were studied, together with the age-related protection afforded by pregnancy.

The commonest of the unsuspected AIDS-related diseases were cytomegalovirus infection (49% of all cases), systemic fungal infection (20%), systemic Kaposi's sarcoma (14%), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection (11%), and systemic herpes infection (9%). Cryptococcal infection and cytomegalovirus retinitis were always diagnosed antemortem; and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia went undiagnosed in only 5 of 58 (9%) patients who had proven infection either clinically or at necropsy. 8 patients who died with fungal pneumonia had undergone bronchoscopy; however, in only 1 patient was it diagnosed antemortem. Tuberculosis was undiagnosed in 4 patients. 4 cases of central nervous system lymphoma diagnosed only at necropsy had been treated empirically for toxoplasmosis. Bacterial pneumonias contributed considerably to mortality in 30% of the patients.\r"

If either drug dose cause leucopenia, the incidence is likely to be in the range of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 patients. Among patients who were reported to have attempted suicide, 56 of 246 survivors of amitriptyline overdoses required intensive care, compared with none of 92 patients who overdosed with mianserin. 4 patients who overdosed with amitriptyline alone died, compared with none of the patients who overdosed with mianserin alone. Both drugs are associated with a low risk of blood disorders, but mianserin is appreciably safer than amitriptyline because of its low toxicity in overdosage.\r"

The inner ears were radiographically abnormal in 57% of operated ears. In the remaining cases, subtle malformations beyond the resolving power of radiographic studies were suspected. Early postsurgical hearing loss (defined as a loss greater than 10 dB in three-tone average or greater than 15% in speech discrimination score) was found in 29% of operated ears (14/49). However, only two of these patients lost all of their residual hearing postoperatively (2/49 or 4%). An enlarged endolymphatic sac was noted at surgery in 50% of those with significant postoperative hearing losses. Longer-term stability of hearing was assessed in 22 patients with bilateral inner-ear pathology who underwent surgery on one side only. A comparison of the hearing fate of the operated and nonoperated ears suggested no benefit from the surgical intervention when compared to the natural history of the disease. Based upon this experience, endolymphatic sac surgery for the purpose of hearing stabilization in patients with congenital malformations of the inner ear is no longer recommended.\r"

Periosteal new bone formation in the labyrinthine segment narrows the fallopian canal and protrudes into the nerve, which completely fills the canal. The tympanic and mastoid segments of the nerve show severe degeneration of nerve fibers and an increase in connective tissue between fascicles. An attempted facial nerve decompression did not reach the area of primary pathology in the labyrinthine and meatal segments of the nerve, which could have been exposed by the transtemporal supralabyrinthine approach.\r"

Since 1985, we have used a facial nerve stimulator/monitor as an added safety feature in 383 consecutive otologic and neurotologic cases. In our last 30 middle-ear, 8 retrolabyrinthine vestibular neurectomy, and 14 acoustic neuroma cases we used the monopolar stimulator probe-tip to determine threshold currents needed to produce facial twitch. Stimulation thresholds varied according to the amount of soft tissue or bone overlying the facial nerve. The stimulator was useful for predicting dehiscences in the bony facial canal during middle-ear and mastoid surgery. The exposed facial nerve usually stimulated at a level less than 0.1 mA (mean 0.05 mA), and the horizontal facial nerve covered by bone stimulated at 0.25 mA or greater (mean 0.6 mA). The stimulator was also used to predict the amount of bone overlying the vertical facial nerve at the annulus. An approximate relationship of 1.0 mA of threshold current to 1.0 mm of bony covering was found. After acoustic neuroma surgery, the stimulation threshold of the facial nerve at the brain stem helped predict postoperative facial function. Cases with current thresholds of 0.3 mA or less resulted in normal facial function. During ear surgery, routine identification of the facial nerve with the aid of a facial nerve stimulator will help avoid facial nerve injury.\r"

The number of explants with outgrowth and the number and length of neuritic outgrowths were determined on a regular basis for 12 days. Explants in the experimental group were irradiated with a helium-neon laser using different incident energy densities (IED). Explants in the fluorescent light control group were exposed to fluorescent light for the same periods of time as those in the experimental group were exposed to laser irradiation. Explants in another control group were not exposed to laser or fluorescent light irradiation. The IED of 0.5 J/cm2 laser irradiation has been found to increase significantly the number of explants with outgrowth and the number and length of the outgrowths. Other laser IEDs or fluorescent light irradiation did not influence maturation or regeneration.\r"

Experience with tumors in this area prompted a review of the anatomy of the buccal space and resulted in an improvement in the surgical technique.

Using simple equations and diagrams, the presentation illustrates the variables which determine the magnitude of each of the three major steps in the partial pressure of O2 along the passage, from: (i) ambient air to alveolar gas; (ii) arterial blood to venous blood; and (iii) capillary blood to tissue. The emphasis is on steps (ii) and (iii), and how they are modified from the normoxic case by ischemia, anemia, hypoxia, and increased VO2. The basic context of step (iii) is the Krogh model. This model, despite its limitations, is proposed as conceptually useful in analyzing whole-body or tissue O2 transport.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the acute effects of two exercise intensities on three measures of appetite. Fifteen, 12-h-fasted, college-age males completed three experimental sessions in counterbalanced orders: no-exercise control; cycle exercise performed at 35% VO2max; and cycle exercise performed at 68% VO2max. Both exercise conditions involved a total energy expenditure of 4.1 kcal.kg-1 body weight. Dependent measures were intermittent hunger and sucrose palatability ratings, and food intake at a test meal given approximately 1 h post-exercise. Hunger was briefly suppressed in the high-intensity exercise condition compared to low-intensity exercise and control, while intake of liquid-source kilocalories and carbohydrates was higher after the exercise sessions. Total caloric intake remained stable. Sucrose palatability did not vary across sessions. Intensity is inferred to be an important variable mediating exercise effects on appetite. Relations between appetite measures are discussed, and validity of sucrose palatability ratings and common methods of measuring food intake questioned. Exercise, while not decreasing food intake, does not appear to increase it, and the benefits of exercise for body fat reduction are not immediately offset by compensatory caloric intake.\r"

The studies were performed after oral administration of NaHCO3 (alkalosis) and CaCO3 (placebo). There was a significant increase in resting blood pH after NaHCO3 ingestion (7.35 +/- 0.02) compared to placebo (7.27 +/- 0.02). A longer endurance time was achieved during alkalosis (75.3 +/- 8 s) than during control (61.5 +/- 2 s), but similar blood pH and HCO3- levels were found at exhaustion in both treatments. Metabolic alkalosis resulted in higher elevation in muscle lactate concentration (31.7 +/- 4.6 mmol.kg-1 wet weight) compared to control (17 +/- 4 mmol.kg-1 wet weight). Despite longer exercise duration in alkalosis, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations at exhaustion were reduced by 30 and 34%, respectively. These results indicate that alkalosis increased muscle lactate accumulation during exhaustive exercise. These changes were associated with a reduced blood catecholamine response to exercise.\r"

To examine the effect of vitamin B6 and carbohydrate on fuel substrates during exercise, 5 young/trained, 5 young/un-trained, and 5 post-menopausal/un-trained women were alternately fed four diets (varying carbohydrate and B6 level) over a 7-wk period. Subjects were exercised at the end of each dietary period at 80% VO2max for 20 min on a cycle ergometer. Blood was drawn pre-, post-, post-30, and post-60 min of exercise and analyzed for plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, glucose, free fatty acid, and lactate. ANOVA showed no difference among groups or diets for lactate, although lactate was significantly different over time (P less than 0.0001) on all diets. ANOVA showed significant time x group x diet inter-actions for free fatty acid (P less than 0.05) and significant diet x time (P less than 0.04) and time x group (P less than 0.03) inter-actions for glucose. Supplementation and/or increased carbohydrate resulted in lower free fatty acid during exercise in all groups. ANOVA showed no difference in pyridoxal 5'-phosphate for groups with respect to diet or time, but did show a significant increase from pre- to post-exercise and a significant decrease from post- to post-60 min of exercise. These results indicate that a high-carbohydrate diet and/or supplemental vitamin B6 can alter plasma fuel substrates during exercise in women; however, the effect depends on age and level of training.\r"

Their average training distance was increased from 4,266 to 8,970 m.d-1, while swimming intensity was maintained at 94% (SE +/- 2%) of their maximal oxygen uptake, resulting in an average caloric cost during training of 2,293 kcal.d-1 (+/- 74). As a result of the intensified training regimen, the swimmers experienced local muscular fatigue and difficulty in completing the training sessions. Nevertheless, their swimming power, sprinting (s.22.86 m-1), endurance (s.365.8 m-1) performance, aerobic capacity, and muscle (m. deltoid) citrate synthase were unchanged as a consequence of the 10-d training regimen. Four of the 12 swimmers were, however, unable to tolerate the heavier training demands, and were forced to swim at significantly slower (P less than 0.05) speeds during the training sessions. These men were found to have significantly reduced muscle glycogen values, which was the result of their abnormally low carbohydrate intake. The findings of this research suggest that some swimmers may experience chronic muscular fatigue as a result of their failure to ingest sufficient carbohydrate to match the energy demands of heavy training.\r"

Blood samples were obtained pre-exercise and immediately and 5 min after a sub-maximal (approximately 95% VO2max) front crawl swim (365.8 m) on days 0, 5, and 11. Swim performance was assessed from a maximal front crawl swim (365.8 m), two maximal front crawl sprints (22.9 m), and a semi-tethered swim power test. No significant changes were observed in performance. Pre-exercise serum cortisol (17.5 +/- 1.5, 19.5 +/- 1.6, and 20.6 +/- 1.2 micrograms.dl-1 for days 0, 5, and 11, respectively) and creatine kinase (56.2 +/- 7.7, 93.1 +/- 10.1, and 119.0 +/- 23.1 U.l-1 for days 0, 5, and 11, respectively) values were significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) on days 5 and 11 compared to day 0. Resting plasma catecholamine concentrations were higher but not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) at the end of the training period. Measurements of hemoglobin and hematocrit indicated a relative increase of 11.4 +/- 2.7% (P less than 0.05) in estimated plasma volume during the training period. Resting blood glucose values were unaffected by the training regimen while small but significant decreases in resting blood lactate values (1.01 +/- 0.06, 0.85 +/- 0.06, and 0.86 +/- 0.06 mmol.l-1 for days 0, 5, and 11, respectively) were observed on days 5 and 11.

The subjects exercised approximately 1 h.d-1 at about 68% of VO2max. The 6-d protocol elicited no improvement in VO2max (2.50 +/- 0.14 before vs 2.58 +/- 0.15 l.min-1 after training). Heart rates were significantly lower by 5 to 8 b.min-1, systolic blood pressures were reduced by 16 to 19 mm Hg, and blood lactate concentrations were 25 to 35% less at the same exercise intensities (60, 70, and 80% of VO2max) after 6 d of exercise. Rate pressure product was about 15% lower at the same exercise intensity after 6 d of training (P less than 0.05). The respiratory exchange ratio during submaximal exercise was 0.02 to 0.04 units lower (P less than 0.05; P less than 0.01) after 6 d of exercise, indicating a shift in substrate utilization favoring fat oxidation. These findings suggest that short-term endurance training can induce heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic adaptations to sub-maximal exercise before there is a significant increase in VO2max in sedentary, middle-aged men who are capable of vigorous exercise.\r"

Seven of 30 of the USTS triathletes (3 males, 4 females) were found to have occult blood in their urine, post-race. Only two of the USTS triathletes (1 male, 1 female) were anemic as judged by pre-race hemoglobin levels.

Pre- and post-race venous blood samples showed that 95% of the IRONMAN athletes had decreases in serum haptoglobin, post-race (mean decrease = 32%). Occult blood was found in the post-race urine of 19 (12 males, 7 females) of the IRONMAN competitors. Nineteen IRONMAN triathletes (18 males, 1 female) were judged to be anemic from pre-race hemoglobin measurements. Data from two different length triathlons suggest that nearly all triathletes break down red blood cells during a race, and that the extent of the hemolysis is related to race distance.\r"

No significant changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume occurred in either group during deadlift. End-systolic volume remained unchanged in the elderly while it decreased significantly in the younger subjects. These data indicate that cardiovascular responses and contractile state in normal young men and normal exercise-trained elderly subjects were augmented during upright sub-maximal isometric deadlift exercise, utilizing large muscle mass. However, left ventricular contractility increased less in the elderly subjects compared to the younger subjects.\r"

Previous studies reported increased electromyographic activity of a muscle being stretched during antagonist muscle activation. Five male subjects performed a stretching method which consisted of active plantarflexion, followed by active dorsiflexion. Adjacent surface and implanted wire electrodes were applied to the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. Comparison of the surface electrode recordings showed apparent cocontraction during dorsiflexion. However, no activity was observed on the soleus wire electrode trace during the dorsiflexion phase of the stretching method. Power spectral analysis showed a significant (P less than 0.001) frequency shift between plantarflexion (91.9 V2.Hz-1) and dorsiflexion (66.1 V2.Hz-1) from the surface electrode recordings. Cross-correlation between tibialis anterior and surface soleus activity during dorsiflexion provided strong evidence that the apparent electromyographic soleus signal originated in the tibialis anterior muscle with an average of 8.7 ms delay of the surface soleus signal. Although not generalizable to other studies, it was concluded that in this study the tracings from the surface electrodes, which gave the appearance of co-contraction between antagonist muscles, were actually cross-talk between the electrodes. The rationale for antagonist contraction during stretching in order to inhibit contraction of the muscle being stretched is supported with this evidence and is consistent with those studies which show greater range of motion gains using the reversal technique.\r"

Film analysis of seven high jumpers showed that the radial velocity of the center of mass with respect to the supporting foot was more negative or less positive than the vertical velocity throughout the take-off phase. This favored faster eccentric or slower concentric conditions of the leg muscles. The radial distance from the hip of the take-off leg to the center of mass (RG/H) first decreased by 0.030 m, due to negative radial motions of the arms and swinging leg. This contributed to a smaller negative radial velocity of the hip (VRH), and thus to slower eccentric conditions of the muscles of the take-off leg. Therefore, it may have helped to cushion the initial impact with the ground. Subsequently, RG/H increased by 0.120 m, due to positive radial velocities of the arms, the swinging leg, and the head and trunk. This contributed first to larger negative (and later to smaller positive) VRH values, and thus to faster eccentric and slower concentric conditions of the muscles of the take-off leg.\r"

The mean of the 12 fat thickness measurements and individual site thicknesses were compared between individuals using analysis of variance. In males, the mean thicknesses for ultrasound and calipers were similar (P greater than 0.05) but both were less than the MRI (P less than 0.001). MRI and ultrasound were similar in females but less than calipers (P less than 0.001). A good between-subject correlation was found between all three methods in the males but only the calipers and MRI were well correlated in females. Within-subject correlations are poor for all measures and in both sexes. Factor loadings for a varimax rotation of two principal components indicate that the fat is distributed in 1 of 2 patterns: either principally on the trunk or on the limbs. The principal component analysis and the result of canonical correlations obtained from the factor loadings confirm the findings of the analysis of variance, in that a general level of fatness is measurable by all three methods over a range of subjects. However, the pattern of fat thicknesses measured over a number of specific sites by one method of measurement is unlikely to be duplicated by either of the other two methods on the same individual.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to cross-validate these equations using densitometric estimates of minimal weight. Skeletal dimension measurements and hydrostatic weighing were completed on 220 Iowa high school wrestlers at various times in and out of season. High concurrent validity (r = 0.93) and small residual errors (less than 0.33 kg) were observed when compared to densitometric estimates. Regression weights were of similar magnitude to those from the previous study. Two new prediction models were tested. Model II enhanced the multiple R over previous equations to 0.962 and decreased the SEE by 25% (0.55 kg). The equation was: Minimal Weight (lbs) = 0.49 x Current Weight (lbs) + 1.65 x Height (inches) + 1.81 x Chest Diameter (cm) + 6.70 x Right Wrist Diameter (cm) + 1.35 x Chest Depth (cm) - 156.56.

  ".W": "A treatment has been developed to alleviate muscle weakness in murine dystrophy. Cultured myoblasts from genetically normal mouse embryos were injected into the right soleus of 20-day-old normal or dystrophic mice. Hosts and donors were immunocompatible but exhibited different genotype markers. Donor cells produced GPl-1CC. Host cells produced GPl-1BB. When compared with contralateral controls 6 months postoperatively, test dystrophic solei exhibited greater cross-sectional area, total fiber number, wet weight, and twitch and tetanus tensions. They contained more normal-appearing and less abnormal-appearing fibers. Their mean fiber resting potential was similar to that of normal controls. Presence of GPl-1CC with or without the hybrid isozyme GPl-lBC in these muscles implied the survival and development of donor myoblasts into normal myofibers, and fusion of normal myoblasts with dystrophic satellite cells to form genetically mosaic myofibers. Injection of fibroblasts instead of myoblasts caused detrimental effects.\r"

We have developed a computer algorithm for on-line mathematical correction for this artifact, thus improving the reliability of neuromuscular jitter estimates. The method, based on a modeling technique, was validated using intramuscular stimulation in order to either exclude an IDI-dependent component (using regular stimulation) or to include an IDI-dependent component (using pseudorandom stimulation). In 10 normal subjects the distribution of 106 corrected jitter values obtained using voluntary activity showed no difference from the measured values. This finding implies that previously published values for normal jitter are not likely to have been influenced by the VRF effect.\r"

We observed total destruction of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. In nearly all animals, signs of automutilation were observed in the paralyzed limb. Histological evidence of nerve degeneration appeared soon after injection, with intense proliferation of perineurial cells that eventually divided the endoneurium into numerous microcompartments.\r"

In normal subjects, the response was a combination of both action potentials which could be seen as separated peaks only when the recording was made at midarm with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees. This finding is mainly attributed to the longitudinal sliding of nerves according to the joint movements. In patients with a carpal tunnel syndrome, there were a striking separation between the responses of both nerves in wrist recording. This finding allows this technique to be applied in the clinical inspection of median nerve entrapment at wrist, demonstrating graphically the delay on the median nerve action potential with regard to that of the ulnar nerve.\r"

To determine whether androgen action on SNB motoneurons is crucial for BC/LA survival, we removed SNB cells in newborn female rats by lumbosacral spinalectomy, administered testosterone propionate (TP) on days 1 and 3 of life, and examined for the presence of BC/LA muscles in adulthood. BC/LA muscles were present in all TP-treated spinalectomized females, and staining of these muscles with alpha-bungarotoxin or for acetylcholinesterase showed no evidence of cholinergic innervation. Thus, complete neonatal denervation of the BC/LA does not prevent TP from sparing these muscles, suggesting that androgen acts directly upon BC/LA muscles to maintain them during development. This androgenic maintenance of the BC/LA may be crucial for the survival of SNB motoneurons.\r"

  ".W": "The Ca ATPase content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of fast and slow twitch skeletal fibers was estimated using two well-characterized muscles of the guinea pig: the white bundle of the vastus lateralis and the soleus. Ca ATPase surface density was determined by counting the projections of individual molecules revealed on the cytoplasmic surface of freeze-dried, rotary-shadowed microsomal vesicles isolated from the two muscles. The Ca ATPase densities were 32,000/micron 2 and 25,000/micron 2 for the vastus lateralis and soleus muscles, respectively. The percentage of membrane area occupied by Ca ATPase-free lipid patches was estimated using freeze-fractured, rotary-shadowed in situ SR. In soleus muscle the free SR of terminal cisternae and the longitudinal SR have 34.5 and 19.7% of their surface free of ATPase, respectively. In the white vastus less than 1% of the surface was not occupied by Ca ATPase. These values were combined with stereological data from the literature to give a ratio of total Ca ATPase content per unit fiber volume of 1:2, slow versus fast. This is considerably less than the approximately sixfold difference in the overall relaxation time and the half times to relaxation between the two fiber types. This suggests that other factor such as differences in enzyme kinetics or cytoplasmic Ca buffering proteins must also play a role in determining rate of relaxation.\r"

Results of nerve conduction studies and needle examination were abnormal in 30% of the patients, one patient having a reduced ulnar sensory nerve action potential amplitude and five others having neurogenic motor unit potential changes in the hand muscles. Ulnar SEPs were abnormal in three patients (15%), and median SEPs were abnormal in one patient, who also had abnormalities in ulnar SEPs. In patients with TOS, routine nerve conduction studies and needle examination were the most helpful electrophysiologic studies in excluding more common conditions. The routine use of ulnar SEPs in the evaluation of patients with TOS is probably not worthwhile.\r"

The effects of anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC), a well-known myotonia-producing chemical, were also tested for comparison. In the presence of these drugs the electrical threshold was lowered, and a constant current pulse produced multiple spiking. Short trains of direct stimuli were often followed by after-activity, and this caused a myotonia-like prolongation of muscle contraction. Voltage-clamp experiments showed that 0.05 mM anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, 1 mM furosemide, and 1 mM clofibrate decreased the chloride conductance of the muscle fiber membrane to 14, 18, and 40%, respectively, of the normal value, and the myotonia-inducing potency of the 3 drugs was correlated with the decreased chloride conductance. The potassium currents were not affected by these compounds.\r"

Ischemia was produced by tight ligation at the base of the tail. The time required for nerve action potentials (NAP) to disappear was defined as the disappearance time of NAP (DT-NAP). Both STZ and glucose rats showed a marked prolongation of DT-NAP at 2 hours after injection of STZ (up to 120 minutes) or glucose (up to 95 minutes), as compared with the control rats (less than 45 minutes). Hyperosmolar rats showed no prolongation of DT-NAP. The amplitude of NAP remained at the initial level for at least 2 hours after ligation of the sciatic nerve, whereas NAP disappeared within 45 minutes after ligation of the abdominal aorta. These findings indicate that the RICB can be produced by means of hyperglycemia without the presence of diabetic neuropathy and is the most sensitive indicator of hyperglycemia.\r"

In order to determine whether this modification of the phenotypic expression of murine dystrophy is unique to the transplantation system or whether it can be found when other extreme trauma induces dystrophic muscle to regenerate, the extensor digitorum longus muscles of 4-6-week-old normal (129 ReJ +/+) and dystrophic (129 ReJ dy/dy) mice were given two series of injections of the myotoxin bupivacaine, spaced 12 hours apart. These injections resulted in necrosis of approximately 90% of the original myofibers. At 100 days after injection, the regenerated normal muscle appeared \"healthy,\" whereas the regenerated dystrophic muscle displayed histopathological changes. It is suggested that the differences in the time course of innervation of the myotubes in the transplantation system as compared with that in the bupivacaine system may be a factor in determining whether regenerated dystrophic myofibers express a dystrophic morphology.\r"

The biphasic stimulus was a negative rectangular pulse of 0.1-0.2 msec duration followed, after a variable delay, by a positive rectangular pulse of the same duration and variable amplitude. When the conducting distances were long, stimulus artifact did not disturb either monophasically or biphasically evoked potentials. When the conducting distances were short, stimulus artifact occurred with monophasic stimulation but could be diminished readily using biphasic stimulation. The method can be accomplished easily using standard instruments with dual stimulators.\r"

The exception, the lateral plantar nerve, was left intact in one group and frozen at the ankle in the other group. Reinnervation of sweat glands in the paw was charted frequently for 10 weeks using a silastic mold method. We found that sudomotor axons regenerating from the frozen nerve functionally reinnervated sweat glands of the paw sooner, beginning at 15 days postoperation, and at a higher rate than reinnervation from the collateral branching intact nerve, that began at about 25 days. Full recovery occurred by 41 days in most animals of both groups. We also found that stimulation of sweating by pilocarpine activated more sweat glands during the reinnervation period than stimulation by heating the mice, suggesting that the newly regenerating sudomotor axons have a high threshold.\r"

The contractile proteins in these same biopsies were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, native pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis, and by an immunopolypeptide mapping approach. These studies have shown that there is a very heterogeneous distribution of the myosin isozymes, with many fibers containing more than one myosin type.

The first group of healthy subjects had a short test/retest period of between 2 days and 2 weeks, and the second group had a long period between tests, with a mean of 35.7 months. The R and S waves of the LSEP were analyzed separately for latency and amplitude. Test/retest differences were statistically compared. The average correlation coefficient for healthy subjects was 0.84 and for patients was 0.78. These results suggested a remarkable stability of LSEPs in both healthy subjects and patients with nonprogressive neurological disorders. Therefore, we propose that LSEPs can be used in follow-up both to screen for initial dysfunction of the sensory system and to detect any changes in present dysfunction.\r"

In the present study, reinnervation was assessed by the reappearance of miniature endplate potentials that confirmed that axonal regeneration and motor reinnervation was not affected by amiodarone. However, there was a marked delay in the recovery of motor function in the amiodarone-treated mice. Denervation was found to induce an extensive necrosis of muscle fibers in the deeper parts of fast-twitch muscles. Histochemical studies showed that type 1 fibers were spared, necrosis affecting mainly type 2 fibers with relatively high oxidative enzyme activity (fast-twitch oxidative fibers). Biochemical studies showed a significant increase in the amount of amiodarone and its metabolite in denervated muscle of amiodarone-treated mice when compared with contralateral, normally innervated muscles.\r"

Fiber activity was recorded distally with microneurography needle electrodes and proximally with hook electrodes. Records from the hook electrodes allowed the waveform shape and latency following natural stimulation to be compared with that produced by electrical stimuli delivered through the needle electrode. The action potentials from approximately 50% of the recorded fibers failed to propagate beyond the needle electrode. When propagation did occur and the comparison could be made, only 25% of the afferents recorded could be selectively stimulated. This relatively low success rate suggests that a typical microneurography needle is not particularly good for selectively stimulating identified afferents. Thus in human experiments, attempts to microstimulate identified afferents may often include stimulation of unidentified alternative, or additional, afferent fibers at thresholds of sensory perception.\r"

Early in the embryonic development of both muscles, both myomesin and M protein are expressed in primary and secondary myotubes. However, beginning at 10 days in ovo, M protein is gradually suppressed first in primary, then in secondary, presumptive slow-tonic type 3 fibers. M protein is transiently suppressed in presumptive fast-twitch type 2 fibers derived from primary myotubes but continuously expressed in those derived from secondary myotubes. Thus, initially all myotubes have a common intrinsic M band composition with respect to myomesin and M protein, whereas at later stages the expression of M protein is fiber-type specific. Intrafusal spindle fibers, which are segregated from extrafusal fibers around 14 days in ovo, have a heterogeneous M band composition atypical of extrafusal fibers.\r"

  ".U": "88261452\r", 
  ".W": "Between October 1, 1985, and April 1, 1988, we performed balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 170 patients (mean age [+/- SD], 77 +/- 5 years) who had symptomatic aortic stenosis. The procedure was completed successfully in 168 patients and resulted in significant increases in the mean (+/- SD) aortic-valve area (from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2) and cardiac output (from 4.6 +/- 3.4 to 4.8 +/- 1.4 liters per minute) and decreases in the peak aortic-valve pressure gradient (from 71 +/- 20 to 36 +/- 14 mm Hg) (P less than 0.01 for all three comparisons). There were six in-hospital deaths, and five patients required early aortic-valve replacement. Follow-up data were available for all patients, for a period averaging 9.1 months. In addition to the 6 patients who died in the hospital, 25 patients died an average of 6.4 +/- 5.3 months after discharge. Symptoms recurred in 44 patients; they were managed by repeat valvuloplasty in 16 patients, by aortic-valve replacement in 17, and by medical therapy in 11. At the most recent follow-up examination, the symptoms of 103 patients had improved after valvuloplasty; this number includes 15 patients with restenosis who successfully underwent redilation. Life-table analysis indicates that the probability of survival 12 months after the procedure was 74 percent. We conclude that balloon aortic valvuloplasty is an effective palliative therapy for some elderly patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis. Symptoms improve in the majority of patients; although restenosis is common, it can be managed in some patients by repeat balloon dilation.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred consecutive patients 80 years of age or older consented to and subsequently underwent open-heart operations at our institution between July 1976 and May 1987. Fifty of the patients had aortic valvular disease (28 with coexisting coronary artery disease), and 41 had isolated coronary artery disease. Eight patients had mitral valvular disease, and one had a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Ninety had Class IV disease that was functional, ischemic, or both. The most compelling indications for operation in 85 patients were unstable or postinfarction angina, syncope, acute pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock. Twenty-nine patients died soon after operation (within 90 days). New York Heart Association Class IV disease, previous myocardial infarction, cachexia, and emergency operation were preoperative variables associated with early death. Forty-three patients had no complications except for atrial arrhythmias and were discharged from the hospital a mean (+/- SD) of 11.5 +/- 3.7 days after operation. Low cardiac output, acute myocardial infarction, reoperation for bleeding, renal insufficiency, pneumonia, and prolonged endotracheal intubation were the most common serious postoperative complications. Twenty-eight patients who survived postoperative complications were discharged 24.9 +/- 19.6 days after operation. Seventeen patients died 2 to 104 months after discharge from the hospital. Actuarial calculation predicts the survival of 59 percent of patients at three years and 54 percent at five years. Of the 54 patients still alive at this writing, 53 have disease within New York Heart Association and Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classes I or II. For selected octogenarians with unmanageable cardiac symptoms, operation may be an effective therapeutic option.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the value of plasma samples with that of 24-hour urine samples in identifying patients with pheochromocytoma among those with hypertension. We employed specific gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of both urine and plasma for simultaneous assay of norepinephrine and its neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). The study population consisted of 1086 patients with hypertension, among them 25 patients with proved pheochromocytoma. Reference ranges for free norepinephrine and DHPG in plasma and urine were established. Measurement of free norepinephrine in 24-hour urine samples provided the best index of a pheochromocytoma. This technique had 100 percent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity among 1192 urine samples, as compared with 82 percent sensitivity and 95 percent specificity among 358 plasma samples. Simultaneous measurement of norepinephrine and DHPG in urine further improved specificity (to 99 percent), but the use of the ratio of norepinephrine to DHPG reduced sensitivity (to 95 percent), since some patients with pheochromocytoma secrete large amounts of DHPG. We therefore recommend measurement of 24-hour urinary levels of free norepinephrine for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and suggest that simultaneous analysis for DHPG may sometimes prove useful in reducing the rate of false positive results.\r"

  ".W": "The unexpected discovery of thrombocytopenia in an asymptomatic pregnant woman--often considered to be equivalent to the diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura--leads to a variety of interventions, including delivery by cesarean section. However, the actual risk to mothers and their infants posed by incidentally noted thrombocytopenia is not known. To investigate this issue, we performed a prospective study of a group of normal women who delivered at our medical center and their infants during a period of one year. Of the 2263 women who delivered during the year, 1357 were considered to be normal. One hundred twelve of the women (8.3 percent) had mild thrombocytopenia (range of platelet counts, 97 to 150 x 10(9) per liter). The thrombocytopenia had no discernible clinical effect on the women or their infants. The frequency of thrombocytopenia in babies born to this group of women was not appreciably different from that in babies born to the other normal patients who did not have thrombocytopenia, and none of the infants of women with thrombocytopenia had a platelet count of less than 100 x 10(9) per liter. This study demonstrates that the frequency of mild thrombocytopenia is high in normal pregnant women at term and that the thrombocytopenia appears to have no adverse effect on either the mothers or their infants. To perform obstetrical interventions such as cesarean section because of thrombocytopenia in these mothers is not justified.\r"

These lesions also prevent the effect of word repetition on cortical event-related potentials that are associated with these tasks. We have been able to study the response of individual neurons in the human medial temporal lobe to such delayed recognition tasks in epileptic patients undergoing neurosurgery. We found that some MTL neurons preferentially fired on sight of one particular word from a set of ten words used in a memory task, and others fired in response to one particular face. This stimulus-specific firing was maximal during the time that the neocortical event potentials are most sensitive to stimulus repetition, suggesting that the MTL contributes specific information to the cortex during the retrieval of recent memories.\r"

They develop in distinct ways, yet have certain features in common. All three organs use retinal-derived chromophores, coupled to distinct opsins, to provide a diversity of spectral sensitivities. Four opsin genes have been identified thus far in Drosophila; Rh1, Rh2, Rh3 and Rh4 (refs 6-11). We have used in situ hybridization to study the messenger RNAs expressed by these four opsin genes in all three visual organs. Rh1, Rh3 and Rh4 are already known to be expressed in different subsets of cells in the compound eye. We found that, in contrast, opsin Rh2 is the predominant opsin expressed in the ocelli. Opsin Rh1 is known to be expressed in the larval photoreceptor. We found that Rh3 and Rh4 are as well, but not Rh2. The ocellar-specific gene expression of Rh2 is of particular interest for its possible bearing on the function of the ocellus.\r"

  ".U": "88261504\r", 
  ".W": "Certain bacteria promote the formation of ice in super-cooled water by means of ice nucleators which contain a unique protein associated with the cell membrane. Ice nucleators in general are believed to act by mimicking the structure of an ice crystal surface, thus imposing an ice-like arrangement on the water molecules in contact with the nucleating surface and lowering the energy necessary for the initiation of ice formation. Quantitative investigation of the bacterial ice-nucleating process has recently been made possible by the discovery of certain bacteria that shed stable membrane vesicles with ice nucleating activity. The opposite effect, inhibition of ice formation, has been described for a group of glycoproteins found in different fish and insect species. This group of substances, termed antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs), promotes the supercooling of water with no appreciable effect on the equilibrium freezing point or melting temperature. Substantial evidence now indicates that AFGPs act by binding to a growing ice crystal and slowing crystal growth. As the ice-nucleating protein surface is believed to have a structure similar to an embryonic ice crystal, AFGPs might be predicted to interact directly with a bacterial ice-nucleating site. We report here that AFGPs from the antarctic fish Dissostichus mawsoni inhibit the ice-nucleating activity of membrane vesicles from the bacterium Erwinia herbicola. The inhibition effect shows saturation at high concentration of AFGP and conforms to a simple binding reaction between the AFGP and the nucleation centre.\r"

A specific example is the packing of alpha-helices on beta-sheets by interdigitation of nonpolar side chains. The contributions of these interactions to the energetics of protein stability may be measured by simple protein engineering experiments. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to truncate hydrophobic side chains at an alpha-helix/beta-sheet interface in the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (barnase). The decreases in stability of the mutant proteins were measured by their susceptibility to urea denaturation. Creation of a cavity the size of a -CH2-group destabilizes the enzyme by 1.1 kcal mol-1, and a cavity the size of three such groups by 4.0 kcal mol-1.\r"

  ".W": "Embryonic development entails a well defined temporal and spatial programme of gene expression, which may be influenced by active chromosomal domains. These chromosomal domains can be detected using transgenes which integrate randomly throughout the genome, as their expression can be affected by chromosomal position. Position effects are probably exerted most strongly on transgenes that do not contain strong promoters, enhancers or other modulating sequences. Here we have systematically explored position effects using a transgene with the weak herpes-simplex-virus thymidine-kinase promoter, linked to the readily visualized lacZ indicator gene (HSV-TK-lacZ). Each transgenic fetus with detectable expression displayed a unique lacZ staining pattern. Thus expression of this construct is apparently dictated entirely by its chromosomal position, without any construct specificity. Furthermore the transgene is faithfully transmitted to subsequent generations, allowing for systematic mapping of changes in expression during development and in adult life. These results demonstrate that transgenes can indeed be powerful tools to probe the genome for active chromosomal regions, with the potential for identifying endogenous genes involved in organogenesis and pattern formation.\r"

Although EPCs are known to result in extra-pair paternity, there are no previous quantitative estimates of the success of EPCs in fertilizing eggs. We present here estimates of the likelihood of success of extra-pair copulations in a monogamous passerine, the zebra finch Poephila guttata. We show that (1) EPCs occurring under semi-natural conditions in captivity result in extra-pair paternity, (2) sperm from the last male to mate has precedence over previous matings: a single EPC occurring last is disproportionately successful in fertilizing eggs, but EPCs followed by further pair copulations have a low probability of success. These results have important implications for sexual selection theory.\r"

It has been suggested that this migration is guided by factors present on the surface of other neurons or glial cells. The molecular nature of such factors, however, remains to be elucidated. N-cadherin is a cell-surface glycoprotein which belongs to the cadherin family of cell-cell adhesion molecules. This adhesion molecule is expressed in various neuronal cells as well as in glial cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrate embryos and recent immunological studies suggested that N-cadherin may play a role in guiding the migration of neurites on myotubes or astrocytes. To further examine this possibility, we used a molecular-genetic approach; that is, we examined the outgrowth of chicken embryonic optic axons on monolayer cultures of Neuro 2a or L cells transfected with the complementary DNA encoding chicken N-cadherin. The data indicate that N-cadherin is used as a guide molecule for the migration of optic axons on cell surfaces.\r"

  ".U": "88261545\r", 
  ".W": "Visual excitation in retinal rod cells is mediated by a cascade that leads to the amplified hydrolysis of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and the consequent closure of cGMP-activated cation-specific channels in the plasma membrane. Recovery of the dark state requires the resynthesis of cGMP, which is catalysed by guanylate cyclase, an axoneme-associated enzyme. The lowering of the cytosolic calcium concentration (Cai) following illumination is thought to be important in stimulating cyclase activity. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the cGMP content of rod outer segments increases several-fold when Cai is lowered to less than 10 nM. It is evident that cGMP and Cai levels are reciprocally controlled by negative feedback. Guanylate cyclase from toad ROS is strongly stimulated when the calcium level is lowered from 10 microM to 10 nM, but only if they are excited by light. We show here that the guanylate cyclase activity of unilluminated bovine rod outer segments increases markedly (5 to 20-fold) when the calcium level is lowered from 200 nM to 50 nM. This steep dependence of guanylate cyclase activity on the calcium level in the physiological range has a Hill coefficient of 3.9. Stimulation at low calcium levels is mediated by a protein that can be released from the outer segment membranes by washing with a low salt buffer. Calcium sensitivity is partially restored by adding the soluble extract back to the washed membranes. The highly cooperative activation of guanylate cyclase by the light-induced lowering of Cai is likely to be a key event in restoring the dark current after excitation.\r"

  ".W": "The vertebrate visual system can operate over a large range of light intensities. This is possible in part because the sensitivity of photoreceptors decreases approximately in inverse proportion to the background light intensity. This process, called photoreceptor light adaptation, is known to be mediated by a diffusible intracellular messenger, but the identity of the messenger is still unclear. There has been considerable speculation that decreased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (Cai2+) may play a role in light adaptation, and recent experiments in which Ca2+ buffer was incorporated into rod-cells have supported this notion. The extent of the contribution of calcium, however, remains unresolved. We now show that light-dependent changes in sensitivity in amphibian photoreceptors can be abolished by preventing movements of Ca2+ across the outer-segment plasma membrane. These experiments demonstrate that light adaptation in photoreceptors is mediated in cones primarily, and in rods perhaps exclusively, by changes in Cai2+.\r"

  ".U": "88261547\r", 
  ".W": "Retinal rods and cones respond to light with a membrane hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization is mediated by an ionic conductance (the light-regulated conductance) that is kept open in darkness by cyclic GMP acting as a ligand, and which closes in the light as a result of an increase in cGMP hydrolysis triggered by illumination. Calcium ions appear to have a role in this phototransduction process: they provide negative feedback between the conductance, which is permeable to Ca2+ (refs 4, 5), and the concentration of cGMP, which is sensitive to Ca2+ (refs 6-8). This feedback down-regulates the sensitivity to light of a photoreceptor and probably contributes to the important phenomenon of light adaptation in vision. It is still not clear, however, how much of the light adaptation is actually attributable to this Ca2+ feedback. We have examined the responses of amphibian rods and cones to light with the Ca2+ feedback removed. Normally, the response of a cell to a step of light rises transiently to a peak, but rapidly relaxes to a lower level, indicative of light adaptation. When the feedback is removed, however, the relaxation of the response is completely absent; furthermore, the steady response levels at different light-step intensities are well predicted by a statistical superposition of invariant single-photon responses. We therefore conclude that the Ca2+ feedback underlies essentially all light adaptation in rods and cones.\r"

Here we present evidence that lead stimulates diacylglycerol-activated calcium and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, partially purified from rat brain. Picomolar concentrations of lead are equivalent to micromolar calcium in kinase activation, so this regulatory enzyme is sensitive to the lead levels expected from current environmental exposure.\r"

This technique has been used to observe motions of single filaments in solution and in several in vitro movement assays. In a further development of the technique, we report here a method to catch and manipulate a single actin filament (F-actin) by glass microneedles under conditions in which external force on the filament can be applied and measured. Using this method, we directly measured the tensile strength of a filament (the force necessary to break the bond between two actin monomers) and the force required for a filament to be moved by myosin or its proteolytic fragment bound to a glass surface in the presence of ATP. The first result shows that the tensile strength of the F-actin-phalloidin complex is comparable with the average force exerted on a single thin filament in muscle fibres during isometric contraction. This force is increased only slightly by tropomyosin. The second measurement shows that the myosin head (subfragment-1) can produce the same ATP-dependent force as intact myosin. The magnitude of this force is comparable with that produced by each head of myosin in muscle during isometric contraction.\r"

For rational design of such compounds, it is essential to be able to predict the redox potentials and the chemical modifications needed to produce the optimum redox value. Calculating redox potentials is a daunting task for the theoretician, however, as the effect of water solvation is clearly of major significance. Recent successful calculations of differences in the free energies of biologically important molecules in aqueous solution using the free-energy perturbation method prompted us to apply the technique to the computation of two-electron redox potentials. The results are accurate to within 20 mV, suggesting that we should be able to manipulate redox potentials by successfully predicting structures with the appropriate value.\r"

  ".W": "Many birds learn song during a restricted 'sensitive' period. Juveniles memorize a song model, and then learn the pattern of muscle contractions necessary to reproduce the song. Of the neural changes accompanying avian song learning, perhaps the most remarkable is the production of new neurons which are inserted into the hyperstriatum ventralis pars caudalis (HVc), a region critical for song production. We report here that in young male zebra finches many of the new neurons incorporated into the HVc innervate the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) which projects to motor neurons controlling the vocal musculature. Furthermore, far fewer of these new neurons are incorporated into the HVc of either adult males that are beyond the sensitive learning period, or young females (who do not develop song). Thus, a major portion of the vocal motor pathway is actually created during song learning. This may enable early sensory experience and vocal practice to not only modify existing neuronal circuits, but also shape the insertion and initial synaptic contacts of neurons controlling adult song.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the primary retroviral agent responsible for AIDS and related disorders worldwide. One of its identified gene products, tat protein, stimulates in trans the expression of all HIV-1 genes by several orders of magnitude. Cells infected with HIV-1 require tat protein to produce virus, suggesting that trans-activation is crucial for viral replication. The essential cis-acting site for trans-activation, termed tar, resides within the R region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), between -17 and +54 with respect to the initiation site of viral transcription. It is striking that the RNA encoded between +1 and +59 has the potential to form an extensive stem-loop secondary structure which, as a portion of the untranslated leader RNA, would be common to all HIV-1 mRNAs. We now present the results of nucleotide substitution experiments which suggest that tat trans-activation requires presentation of the sequence +30CUGGG+34 in tar within the loop of a RNA hairpin structure.\r"

  ".U": "88261574\r", 
  ".W": "A new Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been recently discovered in mammalian cells. The major substrate of this kinase, a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately equal to 100,000 (100K), has been identified as elongation factor 2 (EF-2), which participates in protein synthesis. The in vivo activity of the EF-2 kinase depends upon growth factors and other agents affecting the level of Ca2+ and cAMP. Its effect on EF-2 activity, however, remained obscure. This work shows that the phosphorylation of EF-2 by the EF-2 kinase results in a drastic inhibition of polyphenylalanine synthesis in poly(U)-directed translation. Phosphorylated EF-2 is completely inactive in translation and, moreover, inhibits the activity of non-phosphorylated EF-2. Dephosphorylation of EF-2 by phosphatase restores its activity. Hence, the phosphorylation of EF-2 directly affects the elongation stage of translation and thus represents a novel mechanism of translational control.\r"

In the T4 loop the bases stack with one another and with neighbouring molecules of the crystal, and not with base pairs of their own hexamer stem. Two thymine T10 rings from different molecules stack between the C1-G16 ends of a third and a fourth hairpin helix, in a manner that suggests T-T base 'pairing' and simulates a long, 13-base-pair helix. Although such T-T interactions would not be present in solution, they illustrate a remarkable tendency of thymines for self-association. Purine-purine G-A base pairs are known to exist in the anti-anti conformation with an increase in local helix width; it may be that more serious consideration should be given to the possible existence of pyrimidine-pyrimidine C-T base pairs with decreased local helix width, particularly where several such base pairs occur sequentially.\r"

Seven of 25 (28%) had either isolated subcortical (12%) or small cortical branch occlusion (16%) consistent with other mechanisms such as small vessel occlusion or embolism. These results suggest that most clinically recognized cerebral infarctions in sickle cell anemia are caused by large vessel disease, but this mechanism may not account for symptoms of cerebral ischemia in all cases.\r"

Benefit was always noted within a week of diet initiation. The diet was well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects, which could usually be reversed by a reduction in levodopa dosage. A low-protein diet is a simple adjunct to levodopa therapy that can be readily instituted on an outpatient basis. It may improve even those patients with fluctuations who have failed to obtain optimal benefit from all forms of manipulation of the dosage schedule of levodopa or the addition of newer ancillary medications.\r"

Maximum serum levels ranged from 70 to 344 micrograms/ml (median, 114 micrograms/ml). VHDPB controlled seizures in all cases where no limits were imposed upon maximum dose (47/50). We found no maximum dose beyond which further doses are likely to be ineffective. Forty patients were intubated prior to VHDPB, but recovered respiratory drive and could be removed from the ventilator despite very high serum levels. This is explained by acute drug tolerance. Hypotension was unusual, related to the highest levels, and easily controlled. VHDPB has many relative advantages over other therapies presently used for RSE.\r"

Neuronal dysgenesis was correlated with the duration of seizure disorder, age of onset, and other etiologic factors, and with clinical outcome. Temporal lobes from 33 neurologically normal autopsy brains which were age- and sex-matched with patients were examined as controls. Severe neuronal ectopia (greater than 8 neurons/2 mm2 white matter) was present in 42% of patients with epilepsy and in none of controls. There was neuronal clustering in 28% of those with epilepsy, and Chaslin's (subpial) gliosis in 38%. Controls did not have these changes. The presence of severe neuronal ectopia and clustering was predictive of a favorable clinical outcome following surgery (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between microdysgenesis and other factors. These findings suggest that the presence of neuronal dysgenesis may be of significance in the clinical outcome following surgery, and that the abnormal tissue may be important as a morphologic substrate for seizures in some patients.\r"

Ictal epileptiform abnormalities were lateralized to the right hemisphere and involved temporal lobe structures in all patients. Three of four patients recorded with subdural electrode arrays were seizure-free following right temporal lobectomy, and the fourth continues to have ictus emeticus at a reduced rate. The consistent right hemisphere lateralization of seizures in this series corroborates with earlier reports documenting right-sided lateralization in four of five previous cases. Two features that help delineate paroxysmal vomiting as an ictal event are (1) patient unawareness of vomiting and (2) its association with other ictal phenomena.\r"

Incontinence, transient symptoms, and gait disturbances occurred more frequently in vascular dementia than in SDAT. A history of cardiovascular disease and stroke was more common in vascular dementia than SDAT. Disturbances of gait, bradykinesia, and pyramidal tract findings were commonly seen in vascular dementia. Advanced technology aided diagnosis in only 6% of patients and CT was the most useful of such tests. An earlier age of onset was noted in those with a positive family history of SDAT. Duration of symptoms at presentation for SDAT patients varied inversely with the rate of progression of dementia 15 to 55 months later, suggesting that individuals who progress more slowly require more time to elapse before the family or patient realizes the need for medical attention.\r"

We examined the short-term effects of amezinium in five patients with severe neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Single-dose administration of amezinium (10 mg) raised both the supine and sitting mean blood pressures by 15 to 45 mm Hg for 8 hours, with a slight increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Repeated administration of amezinium (10 to 40 mg/d) produced an increase in sitting blood pressure in three patients and improvement of the orthostatic symptoms in all patients without remarkable recumbent hypertension. The heart rate was increased in two patients. The results indicate that amezinium is of therapeutic value for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The adrenergic effect of amezinium on the blood pressure and heart rate apparently was related to a slight increase in endogenous norepinephrine in the presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor supersensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "88261709\r", 
  ".W": "Neonatal hypotonia, seizures beginning at 5 days, and severe retardation were noted in a girl with normal karyotype and biochemical evidence of impaired adrenal function. Postmortem examination at 14 months revealed malformative and destructive lesions of central gray and white matter, atrophy of adrenal cortex with striated adrenocortical cells, hepatic fibrosis, and PAS-positive macrophages in several organs. Pathologically and clinically, this patient most closely approximated neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and differed strikingly from X-linked childhood ALD. In contrast, biochemical changes resembled the abnormalities observed in X-linked ALD and differed from those in the neonatal form. The very-long-chain fatty acid accumulation characteristic of both disorders was demonstrated, but unlike neonatal ALD, the levels or metabolism of plasmalogens, pipecolic acid, phytanic acid, and bile acid intermediates were normal, and peroxisomes in a liver biopsy specimen were present in normal number and appeared enlarged. While the case resembles the recently reported entity of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, assignment to this category was excluded by immunoblot studies on postmortem liver, which revealed normal amounts of this enzyme. Correlation of clinical, morphologic, and biochemical data suggests that this case is an example of a so-far undescribed entity, and reinforces the concept that the phenotypic spectrum of peroxisomal disorders is wider than realized.\r"

Cultured fibroblasts accumulated 10 times more triglyceride than controls under glycerol or palmitate feeding. Mutant fibroblasts could not degrade accumulated triglycerides of endogenous origin, but normally degraded endogenously synthesized phospholipids. When the cells were fed with exogenous olein, triglyceride catabolism was in the normal range. Oxidation of long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain fatty acids was normal, and the activities of acidic, neutral, and alkaline lipase in cell extracts were normal. The disease seems to be due to a specific impairment in the degradation of triglycerides synthesized endogenously.\r"

In a well-conducted randomized double blind clinical trial, Cook et al have found that TLI was superior to sham irradiation of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is clear from looking at this data that not all patients responded to TLI and that with time disease activity returned. Our own experience with TLI in two MS patients was very disappointing. Despite its apparent benefit in some conditions, considerable drawbacks are associated with TLI. These include high financial cost, unpleasant treatment-related side effects, and the possibility that more serious morbidity as well as mortality may be treatment-related. Furthermore, the optimum therapeutic regimen for TLI has not yet been established. Issues related to cumulative dose, dose per fraction, frequency of fractions, field of irradiation, and interaction with other therapies still need clarification. For these reasons we do not recommend TLI as a treatment for MS.\r"

  ".W": "One of the hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) is intra-blood-brain-barrier (BBB) IgG synthesis, a byproduct of plasma cells located in and around active inflammatory demyelinating plaques. The rate of IgG synthesis can be measured by plugging CSF and blood IgG and albumin concentrations into our equation. When done in conjunction with CSF and serum analyses for IgG oligoclonal bands, 99% of definite MS patients demonstrate intra-BBB IgG synthesis. At autopsy the pathologic criterion of an inactive plaque of demyelination is absence of inflammatory cells. Hence, we propose that modulation downward or eradication of intra-BBB IgG synthesis (ie, a manifestation of reduced white matter inflammation) in a living patient is a reasonable therapeutic criterion and goal of MS therapy. In a preliminary trial of five severely disabled MS patients, we evaluated the effects of copolymer 1 (COP-1) in daily intramuscular doses of 20 mg (2 patients) and twice daily subcutaneous doses of 15 mg (3 patients) on clinical parameters and on intra-BBB IgG synthesis over a 2-month study period. The results of this trial showed no beneficial effect on neurologic function or on inflammatory demyelination, as assessed by monitoring of intra-BBB IgG synthesis.\r"

Their status was reviewed to determine complications associated with treatment, dosage of medication used to induce a remission, factors which may predict a response to therapy, and subsequent course following treatment. One year following initial treatment, 81% of patients were improved or stabilized. Reprogression occurred in 69% of patients at a mean time of 17.6 months. Fifty-eight patients who initially stabilized after treatment and then reprogressed were treated a second time. One year after retreatment, 70% of these patients were improved or stabilized. Alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and minor infections were the most frequent complications. There were no deaths associated with treatment, the complication rate did not change with multiple treatments, and no late complications have yet been observed. Improvement tended to occur in younger patients with shorter disease duration. Although this treatment regimen is generally well tolerated and can favorably affect the course of chronic progressive MS in a majority of patients, a single treatment does not induce a permanent remission, and some form of maintenance treatment or retreatment is required. Current treatment programs involve testing a modified induction regimen and periodic outpatient booster injections to maintain remission.\r"

All of the major drugs of abuse, including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamine, phencyclidine, heroin, and alcohol, may produce typical eye signs that can be easily detected by a rapid eye test. These signs include ptosis, abnormal pupil size, nonreactivity of the pupil to a light challenge, nystagmus, and non-convergence. When eye signs are detected, drug use should be confirmed by analysis of body fluids. The rapid eye test is suitable for routine use when screening adolescents, athletes, and employees with jobs where safety is essential.\r"
