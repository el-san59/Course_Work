  ".W": "Early and accurate diagnosis of emphysema is said to be invaluable for identification of clinically silent and mild emphysema. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been much advocated for its efficacy in detailed diagnosis of emphysema, and the results have been compared with the pathology grade of emphysema in resected lung specimens. To assess the ability of high resolution CT scan in detecting and grading mild emphysema, we correlated the high resolution CT scan with the pathology grade of emphysema and the destructive index (DI) of lung specimens from 42 patients undergoing thoracotomy for a solitary pulmonary nodule. The high resolution CT scan and the cut surface of the lung, corresponding exactly to the same plane of the CT scan image, were assessed using the picture-grading system of Thurlbeck and coworkers on a scale of zero to 100. The CT scores for all patients ranged from 12 to 57, with a mean +/- SD of 22.1 +/- 9.6 using 1-mm collimation (n = 35), and from 7 to 46 with a mean +/- SD of 16.5 +/- 8.3 using 5-mm collimation (n = 33). The pathology scores ranged from 10 to 57, with a mean +/- SD of 23.2 +/- 9.8 (n = 42). The DI ranged from 15.4 to 67.1, with a mean +/- SD of 31.4 +/- 10.8 (n = 42). The CT scores using 1-mm and 5-mm collimation correlated significantly with the pathology scores (r = 0.68 and 0.76, respectively, p less than 0.001), and with the DI (r = 0.62 and 0.74, respectively, p less than 0.001). The pathology scores correlated significantly with the DI (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). We therefore concluded that high resolution CT can help to identify the presence and grading of mild emphysema.\r"

Defensins are major peptides of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) granules and are both broadly microbicidal and cytotoxic to several tumor cell lines. To determine whether these peptides could play a role in neutrophil-mediated lung injury, we examined the cytotoxicity of defensins and other PMN granule proteins in a chromium release assay with human lung-derived cell lines MRC-5 (lung fetal fibroblast), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma with features of alveolar epithelium), and primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Crude fractionation of an acid extract of human PMN granules yielded four fractions A-D. Only fraction D (containing mostly defensins) was significantly cytotoxic to all three target cells. In contrast, fraction A (containing myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin) and fraction C (containing lysozyme) had little effect, and fraction B (containing chiefly cathepsin G and elastase) was only injurious to endothelial cells. The cytotoxicity of whole PMN granule extracts on pulmonary epithelial and fibroblast targets could be completely accounted for by their defensin content. Fraction D- and defensin-mediated cytotoxicity was concentration dependent, required at least 10 to 12 h to become manifest, and was inhibited by serum. The role of these peptides in lung damage during acute and chronic inflammation deserves further study.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) results in an inflammatory response with persistent neutrophil influx, which contributes to lung damage. Attenuating the response with antiinflammatory agents might delay progression of lung disease. We investigated the effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, ibuprofen, in a rat model of chronic Pseudomonas endobronchial infection and inflammation. The areal percentage of lung inflammation 14 days after animal inoculation with Pseudomonas-containing agarose beads was significantly less in animals treated with ibuprofen (35 mg/kg orally twice daily) (39 +/- 26% SD) compared to animals given placebo (55 +/- 25% SD) (p less than 0.05). Ibuprofen did not increase the pulmonary burden of Pseudomonas, and the ibuprofen-treated infected animals gained weight better than placebo-treated controls. The administered dose of ibuprofen provides plasma concentrations sufficient to inhibit the release of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from rat neutrophils in vitro. Since LTB4 is a potent pro-inflammatory product that promotes neutrophil adherence, aggregation, migration, degranulation, and superoxide release, inhibition of its production by ibuprofen could inhibit inflammatory damage to the lung in this model. These data in an animal model, taken together with the success of a preliminary trial of alternate-day steroid therapy in mildly affected patients with CF, suggest that antiinflammatory therapy with ibuprofen should be considered for a new therapeutic strategy in CF.\r"

In protocols using high dosages of IL-2 and adoptive transfers of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, severe pulmonary toxicities, including pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, are regularly observed. Serial measurements of pulmonary function in patients receiving TIL and continuous infusions of moderate dosages of IL-2 showed the development of mild obstructive and restrictive defects. Partial reversibility of the FEV1 with bronchodilators was observed, suggesting the development of hyperreactive airways. Decreases in lung volumes, DLCO, and gas exchange occurred and may reflect pulmonary infiltration by inflammatory cells, increased lung water, or diminished chest wall function. We conclude that adoptive immunotherapy with TIL and IL-2 produces changes in systemic immune response that may contribute to abnormal pulmonary physiology.\r"

We studied 32 outbred beagle puppies 80 to 155 days of age who were raised in isolation and who were specific pathogen-free. Puppies were inoculated with canine parainfluenza type 2 (CPI2, n = 8), Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb, n = 7), or both CPI2 and Bb (CPI2-Bb, n = 9). Control puppies (C, n = 8) were not inoculated. The puppies were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (5 mg/kg) and chloralose (80 mg/kg) and were ventilated mechanically. Lung resistance (RL), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), functional residual capacity (FRC), and responsiveness to aerosolized histamine were measured 3 days prior to inoculation (Day -3), on the day of inoculation (Day 0), and on Days 3-4, 6, 8-10, and 12-14 after inoculation. Histamine responsiveness was measured as: (1) the concentration of histamine base that increased RL to 150% (PC 150% RL) or decreased Cdyn to 75% (PC 75% Cdyn) of the response to saline (RL sal and Cdyn sal, respectively), and (2) the change in RL or Cdyn after inhalation of 11 mg/ml of histamine when compared with RL sal and Cdyn sal. On Day 0 there were no significant (p greater than 0.05) differences among groups with regard to age-corrected weights, FRC, RL, Cdyn, or histamine responsiveness. Control puppies remained healthy, and their pulmonary function and histamine responsiveness did not change. CPI2-Bb puppies increased RL and decreased FRC on Day 3-4, and were moderately ill and histamine-hyperresponsive on Day 3-4 and on Day 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A number of modifications have been suggested in order to obtain samples relatively enriched for bronchial material. In order to be able to use a standard technique for bronchoalveolar lavage to sample both airways and \"routine\" alveolar material, a simple modification of the technique as described by Reynolds and Newball was used: five sequential 20-ml aliquots were infused into the lower respiratory tract, and each aliquot was immediately aspirated. The return from the first aliquot was processed separately from the return from the subsequent four aliquots. These last four aliquots were pooled. Analysis of the first aliquot revealed it to be enriched for ciliated epithelial cells when compared with the subsequent aliquots. There were also differences in inflammatory cell composition with the bronchial sample containing relatively more neutrophils and relatively less lymphocytes. Aspiration during transoral bronchoscopy was documented by quantifying salivary amylase in the bronchial and alveolar lavage fluids. It was estimated, however, that the aspiration was not of quantitative significance in the vast majority of subjects studied. Finally, with the technique of fractional processing of bronchoalveolar lavage samples, it was possible to compare the protein concentrations in bronchial and alveolar lavages. Most prominent among the differences was a marked relative enrichment in the bronchial samples for immunoglobulin A. The technique of fractional processing of bronchoalveolar lavage samples provides a simple means to obtain samples enriched for bronchial and alveolar components. This should facilitate analysis of lower respiratory tract specimens in airway disease.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial mucosal injury initiates a complex series of repair mechanisms, one of which is reepithelialization of a denuded lumenal surface. This suggests the hypothesis that bronchial epithelial cells, the cells initially affected by bronchial injury, might be able to initiate repair of an injured area by producing a chemotactic activity for intact bronchial epithelial cells. To evaluate this, bronchial epithelial cells were prepared from bovine lung by protease digestion and cultured in medium 199 (M199) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) until confluence, after which the cells were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and serum-free fresh M199 was added. This conditioned medium was then collected and used to test the chemotactic response of bronchial epithelial cells using a blindwell chamber technique. Target cells for this assay were isolated from airways by protease digestion, grown to confluence in M199 with 10% FCS, and then harvested with trypsin. Bronchial epithelial cell-conditioned medium harvested after 3 days attracted more cells (197.0 +/- 5.7 cells/10 high power fields) than did M199 without FCS alone (4.3 +/- 0.9) (p less than 0.01). Checkerboard analysis showed that the migration was chemotactic. The chemotactic activity was nondialyzable, pepsin-labile, acid-stable, heat-labile, and lipid-inextractable. The chemotactic activity accumulated in the culture medium with time. The addition of 25 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide inhibited this accumulation. Column chromatography with Sephadex G-150 revealed a single peak of chemotactic activity in the high molecular weight range. The chemotactic activity was bound to gelatin-Sepharose 4B and was eluted with 6 M urea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the absence of evidence for an infectious etiology, the possibility of immunologic trimellitic anhydride (TMA) hemorrhagic pneumonitis was considered when the lung biopsy excluded Goodpasture's and other diseases and because the patient was a spray painter. Serologic evaluation for antibodies against TMA was requested. Because the immunologic studies for TMA were negative, and because the patient was a spray painter, immunoassays for three isocyanates conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) were carried out although there was no specific history of isocyanate exposure at that time. High levels of IgG and IgE antibodies were detected against hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI)-HSA and toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-HSA. Further investigation documented exposure to spray paint that contained HDI and another isocyanate. The paint was sprayed on warm metal, and subsequently the worker developed an acute illness. Further plant studies were not possible. We propose that the pathogenesis of this case of hemorrhagic pneumonitis is immunologic because of uncontrolled exposure to HDI and TDI, is analogous to the immunologic hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by TMA, and should be considered as a possible cause of a similar acute lung disease after isocyanate exposure.\r"

Apnea duration (APD), arterial oxygen saturation changes (delta SaO2), and the percentage of heart rate changes (delta HR%) during PB with apnea were analyzed. The data were compared with hypoxic heart rate and ventilatory responses assessed at sea level. HR during the apneic period (APD, 10, 8 +/- 1.2 s; delta SaO2, 10.2 +/- 1.8%) was significantly smaller than that during the ventilatory period of PB (56.0 +/- 5.1/min and 74.6 +/- 6.2/min, respectively). This HR slowing or acceleration alternated in accordance with off and on activities in ventilation. The magnitude of delta HR% had a significant correlation with that of delta SaO2 (p less than 0.01). The sensitivity of HR depression to desaturation (delta HR%/delta SaO2) was smaller in low HVR climbers than in high HVR climbers. We concluded that these results can be ascribed to the fact that the primary effect of peripheral chemoreceptors on the cardiovascular center is vagotonia, and the effect is overridden by the vagal pulmonary inflation reflex.\r"

A quantitative analysis of this sleep-induced desaturation, simultaneously comparing patients with different respiratory diseases, could identify patient groups especially prone to develop nocturnal hypoxemia. I have therefore compared the changes in oxygenation during sleep in three groups of patients with the same baseline oxygen saturation but with entirely different types of respiratory dysfunction, namely interstitial lung disease (n = 14), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 29), and scoliosis (n = 10). The patients with scoliosis had considerably larger sleep-induced desaturation than the patients with lung diseases. Their oxygen saturation was also more unstable than that of the others during REM sleep; possibly a consequence of their lower position on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve during this sleep stage. The results suggest that sleep studies may be more informative in patients with scoliosis, for example, where a need for nocturnal-assisted ventilation can be revealed, than in patients with lung diseases.\r"

Boroval has been shown to prevent porcine-pancreatic-elastase-induced emphysema in hamsters. But with HNE-induced emphysema in hamsters, pretreatment with as much as a 170-fold M excess of Boroval, given intratracheally 1 h before 0.3 mg HNE, did not prevent emphysema. Indeed, lung volumes were larger after Boroval pretreatment than after HNE alone. Emphysema was also induced by instilling HNE that had been mixed with and inactivated by a 41-fold M excess of Boroval (a molar ratio of 42). When 0.25 or 0.5 mg of HNE were given mixed with a 41-fold M excess of Boroval, the emphysema was much more severe with the 0.5 mg dose. Two hours after instillation of 0.3 mg HNE inactivated with a 34-fold M excess of Boroval, bronchoalveolar lavage contained elastolytic activity but no evidence of hemorrhage. In contrast, hemorrhage was severe in hamsters that had been instilled with 0.3 mg HNE alone. We conclude that Boroval can enhance HNE-induced emphysema. We postulate that Boroval suppresses HNE-induced hemorrhage and the resultant influx of plasma protease inhibitors; the HNE-Boroval complex is transported into the alveolar interstitium, followed by dissociation of the inhibitor from the active site of HNE. Because of its small size, free Boroval is rapidly cleared, and the reactivated HNE attacks elastic fibers, giving rise to emphysema.\r"

Pathologic assessment of emphysema was obtained in 55 cases who had resection of a lung or an upper lobe, based on a standard reference panel for emphysema grading. In 86 cases, the extent of emphysema was quantitated by computed tomography (CT) of the chest. There was a significant negative correlation between Vc and emphysema assessed by either pathology or CT (r = about -0.5, p less than 0.001) similar to the correlation between DLCO and the extent of emphysema. Results of Vc were significantly lower in cases with moderate emphysema (pathologic grade greater than or equal to 30) than those with no emphysema (grade less than or equal to 5) (p less than 0.001) or mild emphysema (grade 10 to 25) (p less than 0.05), and they were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the group with mild emphysema compared with the group with no emphysema on pathologic assessment similar to DLCO results. Although Vc was reduced in emphysema, determination of Vc did not result in improved discrimination in separating cases with emphysema from those without emphysema when compared with DLCO.\r"

  ".W": "A cohort of approximately 100 student nurses in Los Angeles was recruited for a diary study of the acute effects of air pollution. Smoking histories and presence of asthma and other allergies were determined by questionnaire. Diaries were completed daily and collected weekly for as long as 3 yr. Air pollution was measured at a monitoring location within 2.5 miles of the school. Incidence and duration of a symptom were modeled separately. Pack-years of cigarettes were predictive of the number of episodes of coughing (p less than 0.0001) and of bringing up phlegm (p less than 0.0001). Current smoking, rather than cumulative smoking, was a better predictor of the duration of a phlegm episode (p less than 0.0001). Controlling for personal smoking, a smoking roommate increased the risk of an episode of phlegm (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, p less than 0.001), but not of cough. Excluding asthmatics (who may be medicated), increased the odds ratio for passive smoking to 1.76 (p less than 0.0001). In logistic regression models controlling for temperature and serial correlation between days, an increase of 1 SD in carbon monoxide exposure (6.5 ppm) was associated with increased risk of headache (OR = 1.09, p less than 0.001), photochemical oxidants (7.4 pphm) were associated with increased risk of chest discomfort (OR = 1.17, p less than 0.001) and eye irritation (OR = 1.20 p less than 0.001), and nitrogen dioxide (9.1 pphm) was associated with increased risk of phlegm (OR = 1.08 p less than 0.01), sore throats (OR = 1.26, p less than 0.001), and eye irritation (OR = 1.16, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Women with thoracic wedge compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis had significantly lower percent predicted FVC than did those without fractures. In hierarchical regression analysis, after controlling for age and arm span, there was a significant effect on FVC of the degree of hyperkyphosis as measured by Cobb's angle (increment in R2 = 0.14, p less than 0.001). The addition of the number of vertebral fractures to the model was also significant (increment in R2 = 0.06, p less than 0.002), but cortical bone volume, bone mineral density, and smoking status did not significantly improve the model. From one half of subjects tested, a regression equation was generated relating %FVC and the number of thoracic fractures: %FVC = 103.4 - 9.4 x number of fractures. When used to predict lung function impairment in the second half of study subjects, the correlation between measured and %FVC was r = 0.59 (p less than 0.002). Kyphosis and thoracic compression fractures caused by osteoporosis produce modest but predictable declines in vital capacity in women.\r"

In a retrospective review of 129 consecutive episodes of respiratory disease in HIV-seropositive patients where respiratory tract cultures were obtained, S. aureus was recovered in 30 (23%) of the episodes. Twenty-nine of these were evaluated in this study, and the recovery of S. aureus was found to represent pneumonia in 8 cases (28%), to be of indeterminate significance in 18 cases (62%), and to represent colonization in 3 cases (10%). Episodes of S. aureus pneumonia were usually community-acquired (seven of eight episodes) and had an acute or subacute clinical presentation. Fever and physical signs of pneumonia were present in all patients. Chest radiographic presentations varied, but local infiltrates were seen in seven of eight episodes. Concomitant pulmonary disorders were common (seven of eight episodes). All patients were appropriately treated; five patients recovered and three died, giving a mortality rate of 38%. We conclude that S. aureus is a frequent isolate from respiratory tract cultures of HIV-seropositive patients referred for evaluation of pulmonary disease. It can cause a pneumonia with a high mortality rate, as it did in 6% of all episodes of pulmonary disease reviewed in this study. Clinicians should be aware that HIV-seropositive patients may develop respiratory disease secondary to S. aureus infection and that when this organism is suspected, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be instituted.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigators suggested that increased plasma levels of the terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) are an early marker for the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in septic patients. We asked whether an increase in sC5b-9 was also associated with the development of ARDS from other etiologies and whether sC5b-9 measurements consistently reflected complement activation in vivo. We evaluated 75 patients with sepsis, trauma, hypertransfusion, multiple fractures, aspiration, or pancreatitis who were at risk for ARDS but did not develop the syndrome and 23 patients with similar histories who did develop ARDS. Of the latter patients, seven were identified and studied both when they were at risk and when they had ARDS. Serial blood samples were obtained and analyzed for the complement activation products Bb, Ba, C4d, C3d, IC3b, and sC5b-9. All but one of the patients studied had levels of one or more complement fragments that were greater than 2 SD above the mean obtained from 18 normal subjects. In contrast to the report referred to previously, none of the fragments measured, including sC5b-9, was a specific indicator of ARDS, and no combination of complement fragments predicted which patients at risk would develop ARDS. Patients demonstrated evidence of activation of the classical pathway only, alternative pathway only, or both pathways, but none of these was associated with greater risk or severity of disease. In addition, in several patients only late components were activated, suggesting that enzymes other than those derived from complement activation may be responsible. In conclusion, complement can be activated by a variety of mechanisms in critically ill patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90120357\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether normal, nonhypertensive subjects who have unusually large increases of systolic blood pressure with exercise have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). DESIGN: Case-comparison using echocardiography as a criterion standard for measurement of left ventricular mass and the diagnosis of LVH. SETTING: Population-based health fitness screening program and referral Veterans Affairs Hospital. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine men (average age, 44.6 +/- 8.5 years; range, 34 to 71 years) were studied, including 25 participants in a health fitness screening program and an additional 14 normal men with atypical chest pain. Twenty-two subjects with a systolic blood pressure during peak exercise of 210 mm Hg or greater were compared with 17 others with systolic pressure less than 210 mm Hg during exercise. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index greater than 134 g/m2) was found in 14 of 22 men with a systolic blood pressure of 210 mm Hg or greater (present in 6.3% of normotensive healthy male volunteers in a health screening program) but in only 1 person with a lower exercise blood pressure. Left ventricular mass index was linearly correlated (r = 0.65, n = 39, P less than 0.001) with maximum exercise blood pressure. Whereas LVH was mild in about 50%, substantial LVH was present in the others. The presence of LVH was not related to superior physical conditioning and was accompanied by increased left atrial size suggesting impaired left ventricular filling. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of hypertension, exaggerated blood pressure responses during exercise testing suggest a probability of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.83) of LVH, a finding associated with the cardiac \"end-organ\" manifestations of hypertension.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, prospective trial. SETTING: A comprehensive cancer center. PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients (4 patients [11%], stage III; 31 patients [89%], stage IV [MO]), all evaluable for response and toxicity. INTERVENTIONS: Two to three cycles of PFL before definitive, local-regional therapy (surgery and radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone). Chemotherapy included continuous intravenous infusion of cisplatin (25 mg/m2 body surface area daily, days 1 through 5); 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 body surface area daily, days 2 through 6); and leucovorin (500 mg/m2 body surface area daily, days 1 through 6) administered once every 28 days. Pathologic response was evaluated by surgical resection or biopsy. Serum-reduced folates were measured before and 18 hours after the initiation of chemotherapy. RESULTS: A clinical response to PFL was achieved in 28 of 35 (80%) patients: 23 (66%) patients had a complete response (90% CI, 50% to 79%) and 5 (14%) patients, a partial response. A complete response was confirmed pathologically in 14 of 19 (74%) patients. The most common toxicity was mucositis (grade 2 to 3; 94% of patients). Dose reduction for toxicity was necessary in 11 (31%) patients. There were no treatment-related deaths. Serum levels of leucovorin and (6S)5-methyltetrahydrofolate were measured in 7 patients. After 18 hours, the mean leucovorin level (+/- SD) was 34.3 +/- 1.5 mumol/L, of which only 8.0 +/- 0.5% was the active 6S isomer. The mean serum (6S)5-methyltetrahydrofolate was 9.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and high-dose leucovorin is a new and highly active chemotherapy regimen that can achieve clinical and pathologically confirmed complete responses in a substantial proportion of patients with advanced, local-regional squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Further studies are needed to confirm the activity of PFL and to determine its potential impact on local tumor control and disease-free and overall survival.\r"

The anthropometric measurements taken were abdomen, thigh, suprailiac, biceps, triceps, subscapular, and midaxillary skinfolds; waist and hip circumference; and weight and height. Women between 25 and 83 years of age were included in the study. RESULTS: Patients with breast cancer had a significantly greater waist:hip circumference ratio than controls (P less than 0.001) and a significantly greater suprailiac:thigh skinfold ratio (P less than 0.001). The relative risk for breast cancer increased with increasing waist:hip circumference ratio (less than 0.73 = 1.00; 0.73 to 76 = 1.90; 0.77 to 0.80 = 2.83; greater than 0.80 = 6.46) and with suprailiac:thigh skinfold ratio (less than 0.42 = 1.00; 0.42 to 0.56 = 1.85; 0.57 to 0.71 = 2.25; greater than 0.71 = 5.85). At other sites of upper body obesity, such as the biceps and triceps, skinfolds were significantly greater in patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Although obese women are at slightly higher risk for developing breast cancer, women with android obesity are a segment of obese women who appear to be at a significantly higher risk for developing breast cancer.\r"

Varicella zoster virus, resistant to acyclovir in vitro, was isolated from skin lesions of all four patients. Three patients were adults in whom the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had been diagnosed 12 to 20 months before isolation of acyclovir-resistant varicella zoster virus. The fourth patient was a perinatally HIV-infected child who developed primary varicella infection at age 7 years when profoundly immunosuppressed (absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count less than 50 cells/microL). Mean antiviral susceptibilities (ED50 values) of the four clinical isolates compared with the ED50 values of the reference strain Oka were 85 compared with 3.3 mumol/L for acyclovir, 1.4 compared with 0.8 mumol/L for vidarabine, and 123 compared with 117 mumol/L for foscarnet. When assayed by [125I]-dC plaque autoradiography, 90% to 100% of the viral isolate populations had altered or no measurable thymidine kinase function. Acyclovir-resistant varicella zoster virus infection may complicate long-term oral acyclovir administration in patients with AIDS and may be associated with the appearance of atypical hyperkeratotic papules.\r"

DESIGN: Open label, escalating dosage, phase I-II tolerance trial. SETTING: Massachusetts General Hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and Stanford University Medical School, three tertiary care institutions and members of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases AIDS Clinical Trials Group. INSTRUCTIONS: Cohorts of 3 to 11 patients received rsCD4 by intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection in dosages of up to 30 mg per day for 28 days. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Recombinant soluble CD4 was tolerated by these patients with no significant clinical or immunologic toxicities. Serum levels of rsCD4 in patients receiving doses of 9 or 30 mg per day administered intramuscularly were in the range of rsCD4 concentrations required to inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. A decline in serum HIV-1 p24 antigen was seen in patients receiving 30 mg of rsCD4 daily, but no such changes were noted at lower dosages. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant soluble CD4 is well tolerated by patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex. Our study has also provided preliminary evidence of antiviral activity of rsCD4 in vivo. Our data suggest that further trials of receptor-based therapies against HIV-1 are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of recombinant, soluble human CD4 (rCD4) in subjects with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. The protein rCD4 binds to envelope protein, gp120, of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and blocks HIV infection of CD4 lymphocytes in vitro. DESIGN: Phase 1 trial with dose escalation. SETTING: Two university-affiliated hospital clinics. SUBJECTS: Of 42 subjects enrolled, 29 had AIDS and 13 had AIDS-related complex. INTERVENTIONS: The rCD4 was administered by rapid intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by a 3-day washout, then once a day for 10 days, followed by a 7-day washout, and then three times a week for 8 weeks. Doses of 1, 10, 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg body weight per day of rCD4 were administered intravenously to 6 subjects at each dose level. Twelve additional patients received 300 micrograms/kg.d of rCD4: 6 by intramuscular and 6 by subcutaneous injection. All subjects were monitored for toxicity. Immunologic and virologic variables were also monitored. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Administration of rCD4 was not associated with important toxicity as determined by clinical monitoring or by serum chemistry, hematologic, or immunologic variables. No subjects required dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy due to rCD4-related toxicity. No consistent or sustained changes in CD4 lymphocyte populations or HIV antigen levels were observed. The volume of distribution of rCD4 was small, and clearance remained constant over the dose range studied. The bioavailability of intramuscular injection and subcutaneous injection was 51% and 45%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At the dose levels used in this study, rCD4 appears safe and well tolerated. Serum concentrations of rCD4 were achieved that were comparable to concentrations shown to have antiviral activity in vitro. Further studies are indicated to determine whether rCD4 or related molecules will be useful in treating HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative importance of factors known to cause therapy-resistant hypertension, and to derive an efficient approach to the evaluation of this problem in clinical practice. DESIGN: Consecutive sample. SETTING: University hospital hypertension clinic and clinical research center. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients referred for management of refractory hypertension and found to have a seated diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg while taking a standard dose of hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, and hydralazine or its equivalent for at least 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Seven patients (group 1) had normal, resting mean intra-arterial blood pressure (mean pressure less than 107 mm Hg) and eight had elevated pressure (group 2). Patients in group 1 had minimal or not target organ involvement whereas those in group 2 had higher minimum vascular resistance by forearm plethysmography and greater interventricular septal wall thickness. Factors contributing to resistant hypertension, particularly in group 1, were \"office hypertension\" (clinic systolic blood pressure at least 20 mm Hg higher than home systolic blood pressure), pseudohypertension (cuff diastolic blood pressure at least 15 mm Hg higher than simultaneously determined intra-arterial pressure), and \"cuff-inflation hypertension\" (intra-arterial diastolic blood pressure rise of at least 15 mm Hg during cuff inflation). CONCLUSION: Home blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography are recommended as initial steps in the evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension. Intra-arterial blood pressure measurement is particularly helpful in patients with resistant hypertension who do not have office hypertension yet have normal septal thickness on echocardiography.\r"

DESIGN: Individual trials were double-blind, randomized, multiple crossover trials. The impact of n-of-1 trials was determined by eliciting physicians' plans of management and confidence in those plans before and after each trial. SETTING: Referral service doing n-of-1 trials at the requests of community and academic physicians. OBJECT of ANALYSIS: All trials were planned, started, and completed by the n-of-1 service. MEASURES of OUTCOME: The proportion of planned n-of-1 trials that were completed and the proportion that provided a definite clinical or statistical answer. A definite clinical answer was achieved if an n-of-1 trial resulted in a high level of physician's confidence in the management plan. Specific criteria were developed for classifying an n-of-1 trial as providing a definite statistical answer. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-three n-of-1 trials were planned in various clinical situations. Of 70 n-of-1 trials begun, 57 were completed. The reasons for not completing n-of-1 trials were patients' or physicians' noncompliance or patients' concurrent illness. Of 57 n-of-1 trials completed, 50 provided a definite clinical or statistical answer. In 15 trials (39% of trials in which appropriate data were available), the results prompted physicians to change their \"prior to the trial\" plan of management (in 11 trials, the physicians stopped the drug therapy that they had planned to continue indefinitely). CONCLUSION: We interpret the results as supporting the feasibility and usefulness of n-of-1 trials in clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Cations such as magnesium and aluminum significantly impair the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Twelve healthy adult male volunteers participated in this four-way crossover study to investigate the effects of ferrous sulfate and multivitamins with zinc on the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Doses of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) were given 7 days apart and after an overnight fast. Dose 1 was administered alone (regimen A). The subjects then received either a ferrous sulfate tablet (325 mg three times a day; regimen B) or a once-daily multivitamin with zinc (regimen C) for 7 days; dose 2 of ciprofloxacin was then given with the last dose of regimen B or C. Subjects were crossed over to the alternate regimen for 7 days, and dose 3 of ciprofloxacin was again administered with the last dose of regimen B or C. After a 7-day washout, dose 4 of ciprofloxacin was given (regimen D). Ciprofloxacin concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) of ciprofloxacin for regimens A and D were not significantly different (14.5 +/- 2.3 versus 15.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms.h/ml, mean +/- standard deviation). The AUCs for regimen B (5.4 +/- 1.7 micrograms.h/ml) and regimen C (11.3 +/- 2.4 micrograms.h/ml) were significantly different from the AUCs for regimens A and D. Peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin with regimen B were below the MIC for 90% of strains of many organisms normally considered susceptible. Ferrous sulfate and multivitamins with zinc significantly impaired the absorption of ciprofloxacin. The effect of ferrous sulfate is likely to be clinically significant; the responsible component of multivitamins with zinc requires additional study.\r"

  ".W": "Bloodstream isolates of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from nosocomial infections are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobial agents than isolates from community-acquired cases are. It is not clear, however, how much this is due to the markedly different distribution of organisms in the two groups. We compared the susceptibilities of organisms of a given species which caused community-acquired bacteremia with the susceptibilities of isolates from nosocomial cases. Nine antimicrobial agents were tested against 1,077 isolates which were obtained during a 4-year nonepidemic period. Marked differences in crude rates of resistance were noted for all isolates from nosocomial cases versus all isolates from cases acquired in the community. When results were adjusted for the different organism distributions in the two groups, statistically significant differences were found for only six drug-organism pairs; in each of these, resistance rates were higher in nosocomial isolates. However, when results were further adjusted for the effect of multiple analyses, no significant differences were seen. The major factor leading to the greater prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital organisms was the markedly different distribution of organisms in the nosocomial and community-acquired groups. For individual organisms, greater resistance in nosocomial strains was confined to certain drugs. Factors that influence differences in organism distribution may not be solely the result of antimicrobial use.\r"

  ".W": "The murine model of acquired immunodeficiency disease was used to evaluate both the antiretroviral and antiherpetic activities of the acyclic nucleotide analog 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA). The antiretroviral activity of PMEA was compared with that of azidothymidine (AZT) in mice receiving the drug either immediately after infection or at late times in disease progression. Both AZT (oral, 30 mg/kg) and PMEA (parenteral, 25 and 5 mg/kg) were effective in slowing the development of disease when administered daily beginning on the day of infection. In contrast, neither drug alone was effective in modifying disease outcome when administered several weeks after viral infection. Human recombinant alpha interferon (rhuIFN alpha-B/D at 5 x 10(7) U/kg) was also ineffective when administered late in the course of disease. However, when administered in combination, both alpha interferon and PMEA (25 mg/kg) were able to suppress disease progression even when treatment was initiated as late as 3 weeks postinfection. Mice that were immunocompromised due to LP-BM5 virus infection were highly susceptible to acute (lethal) infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, whereas their immunocompetent littermates were not. PMEA was as effective as acyclovir in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus type 1 infections in LP-BM5 virus-infected mice. Thus, like AZT, PMEA was effective against retrovirus infection, and, like acyclovir, PMEA was effective against herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. This gives PMEA the unique potential of being useful in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus infections as well as the underlying retroviral disease.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (from the United States and Europe) selected for low (borderline)-level methicillin resistance (MIC of methicillin, 2 to 4 micrograms/ml; MIC of oxacillin, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml) were examined for their mechanisms of resistance. Five strains were typical of heterogeneous S. aureus: they gave positive reactions with a DNA probe specific for mec and contained a small fraction (10(-6] of highly resistant cells (MIC, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The rest of the 12 strains were homogeneous with respect to their methicillin resistance: the MIC of methicillin for all cells was 2 to 4 micrograms/ml, and no cells for which MICs were 50 micrograms/ml or higher were detectable (less than 10(-9]. None of these strains reacted with the mec-specific DNA probe. One representative strain of each group was characterized in more detail. Strain CDC-1, prototype of heterogeneous methicillin-resistant S. aureus, contained penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a; its DNA could transform a methicillin-susceptible and novobiocin-resistant recipient to methicillin resistance with ca. 35% linkage to Novr. Introduction of the \"factor X\" determinant (K. Murakami and A. Tomasz, J. Bacteriol. 171:874-879, 1989) converted strain CDC-1 to high, homogeneous resistance. Strain CDC-6, prototype of the second group of isolates, showed completely homogeneous MICs of methicillin, oxacillin, and cefotaxime. The strain contained modified \"normal\" PBPs: PBPs 1 and 2 showed low drug reactivity (and/or cellular amounts), and PBP 4 was present in elevated amounts. No PBP 2a could be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several inhibitors of oxidative drug metabolism inhibit the synthesis of endogenous compounds such as testosterone and cortisol. Since ciprofloxacin is a potent inhibitor of the metabolism of a number of drugs, we studied its effect on serum testosterone and cortisol concentrations in eight healthy male subjects. Blood samples were collected over a 12-h period under baseline conditions and following the first and final doses of ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally every 12 h for 4 days). No significant differences in concentrations or area under the concentration-time curve were found when baseline values were compared with those observed for either testosterone or cortisol after ciprofloxacin administration. These results suggest that ciprofloxacin is unlikely to have either antiandrogenic side effects or clinical utility in lowering testosterone or cortisol concentration.\r"

An effect of inoculum density on apparent MIC, the bactericidal activity of these agents, and the targets of the three cephems were determined. The MICs of cefixime, cefpodoxime, and ceftibuten for 90% of the Amps and AmprBLP isolates were 0.04, 0.08, and 0.08 microgram/ml, respectively. In contrast, the MICs for 90% of the AmprNBLP strains were 0.96, 1.92, and 7.68 micrograms/ml. No significant inoculum effect was observed for any group of strains comparing inocula of 10(3) and 10(5) CFU, whereas only the AmprNBLP isolates showed a marked effect at an inoculum of 10(6) CFU. Although bactericidal levels were achieved for the Amps and AmprBLP strains, tolerance to cefixime and ceftibuten was observed. The bactericidal activity for the AmprNBLP strains was limited, with cefixime showing the highest activity of the three cephems. Penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 5 revealed high affinity, with 50% inhibitory concentration levels below the MIC for all three cephems, suggesting that these are important targets of these agents in H. influenzae. We conclude that the cephems are highly active in vitro against Amps and AmprBLP strains of H. influenzae, but less so against AmprNBLP isolates.\r"

Mortality risk factors that were determined to be statistically important included presence of pneumonia, persistent fever in the presence of anti-infective therapy of more than 1 week duration, and peak serum creatinine of greater than 1.2 mg/dl. Initial aminoglycoside dosing in the febrile neutropenic patient should be similar to that in the nonneutropenic patient, with concentrations in serum monitored and doses adjusted accordingly.\r"

Ten healthy volunteers participated in each study. Concentrations in serum and urine were measured by bioassay, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the usual open one- or two-compartment models (statistics were determined by the Wilcoxon test). The antacid, pirenzepine, and ranitidine had no influence on the bioavailability of amoxicillin, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Only small differences could be observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters, but they are not of therapeutic importance. However, the antacid caused a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in the gastrointestinal absorption of doxycycline (area under the concentration-time curve, 38.6 +/- 22.7 mg.h/liter, fasting; 6.0 +/- 3.2 mg.h/liter, with antacid), resulting in subtherapeutic levels of doxycycline.\r"

Ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The peak concentration in serum, total body clearance (CLs), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), and terminal elimination half-life after intravenous dosing were 3.5 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml, 4.38 +/- 1.80 ml/min per kg, 1.6 +/- 0.6 liters/kg, and 5.8 +/- 2.4 h, respectively. The peak concentration in serum, time to peak concentration in serum, absorption lag time, and absolute bioavailability (F) after oral dosing were 7.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml, 1.9 +/- 1.0 h, 0.4 +/- 0.5 h, and 7.7 +/- 24.2%, respectively. The elevated drug concentrations in serum samples from the elderly after oral dosing, compared with data obtained from younger subjects, appear to be a function of reduced CLs, renal clearance, and Vss. The increased F observed in some patients may be due to the effect of concomitant or proximate administration of tube feedings, medications which may alter gastric motility or acidity, or decreased first-pass metabolism. The results demonstrate that factors related to age and declining renal function, rather than infectious disease state, may be primary in determining alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters in the elderly. In elderly patients with normal renal function for their age, no dosage adjustment for intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin is necessary.\r"

Five female New Zealand White G(-) rabbits were given a single oral dose of 2 mg of SCH per kg of body weight. Levels in plasma, determined by gas-liquid chromatography-electron capture, were obtained for 6 days. This procedure was repeated 2 weeks later with the same rabbits, which were induced and maintained G(+) with cytosine arabinoside. There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetic parameters of G(+) and G(-) rabbits. Among all animals studied, the maximum concentration of the drug in plasma was 1.4 +/- 0.11 micrograms/ml at 4 +/- 0.5 h, the half-life was 25 +/- 1.4 h, the volume of distribution at steady state was 3.8 +/- 0.3 liters, and the area under the concentration-time curve was 44 +/- 3.4 micrograms.h/ml. SCH was detectable in plasma up to day 6. Levels of SCH in tissue were studied at steady state in six G(+) and six G(-) rabbits receiving 2 mg of the drug orally per kg per day for experimental disseminated candidiasis. Tissue SCH levels equalled or exceeded those in plasma (at steady state) at all sites examined, and these ratios were similar in both G(+) and G(-) rabbits. Thus, plasma pharmacokinetics of orally administered SCH were similar for G(+) and G(-) rabbits, and SCH achieved high levels of penetration into multiple tissues, including the liver and the central nervous system.\r"

In intact mycelia, 5FC was found to be deaminated to 5-fluorouracil and then transformed into fluoronucleotides; the catabolite alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine was also detected in A. fumigatus. Neither 5-fluoroorotic acid nor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate was detected in perchloric acid extracts after any incubation with 5FC. 5FC, 5-fluorouracil, and the classical fluoronucleotides 5-fluorouridine-5'-mono-, di-, and triphosphates were identified in the acid-soluble pool. Two hydrolysis products of 5-fluorouracil incorporated into RNA, 5-fluorouridine-2'-monophosphate and 5-fluorouridine-3'-monophosphate, were found in the acid-insoluble pool. No significant differences in the metabolic transformation of 5FC were noted in the two species of Aspergillus. The main pathway of 5FC metabolism in the two species of Aspergillus studied is thus the biotransformation into ribofluoronucleotides and the subsequent incorporation of 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate into RNA.\r"

The results showed that cefetamet elimination was dependent on renal function. After intravenous dosing, total body (CLS), renal (CLR), and nonrenal (CLNR) clearances were linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLCR; r = 0.95, 0.92, and 0.59, respectively). Elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) was prolonged from 2.46 +/- 0.33 h in normal subjects to 29.1 +/- 13.9 h in patients with CLCR of less than 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Correspondingly, CLS and CLR decreased from 1.77 +/- 0.27 and 1.42 +/- 0.25 ml/min per kg to 0.14 +/- 0.04 and 0.04 +/- 0.03 ml/min per kg, respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state (0.298 +/- 0.049 liter/kg) for cefetamet was not altered by renal insufficiency (P greater than 0.05). After oral administration, the elimination parameters, t1/2 beta and CLR, were insignificantly different from the intravenous data (P greater than 0.05). Furthermore, the bioavailability (F) of cefetamet pivoxil (45 +/- 13%) was not altered by renal failure (P greater than 0.05). However, maximum concentration in plasma and the time to achieve this value were significantly increased (5.86 +/- 0.74 versus 14.8 +/- 6.14 micrograms/ml and 3.9 +/- 1.1 versus 8.4 +/- 1.7 h, respectively; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Piperacillin MICs were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2 or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. The higher concentration was generally more effective. Tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. Although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. MICs were reduced to the susceptible range for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against Morganella spp. Some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. The inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. Combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. In particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 enzymes. In vitro activity was reflected in vivo. Tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous injection of cefmetazole at doses ranging from 40 to 400 mumol/kg of body weight led to an increase in its biliary concentration and excretion rate, with a maximum at 30 min after injection. Excretion of cefmetazole into bile was associated with a marked choleresis. The magnitude of the increase in bile flow was dose dependent, with a maximal increase at a dose of 200 mumol/kg. Cefmetazole administration did not affect the secretion of bile acids or their osmotic activities, whereas the bile acid-independent bile flow increased by 49% at a dose of 200 mumol/kg. Cefmetazole administration at a dose of 200 mumol/kg significantly increased the biliary outputs of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate (+36, +56, +28, and +31%, respectively) compared with outputs of controls. A linear relationship was observed between bile flow and cefmetazole excretion, 44 microliters of bile being produced per mumol of cefmetazole excreted into bile. Our results demonstrate that cefmetazole induces choleresis by stimulating bile acid-independent bile flow. This effect appears to be partly due to the osmotic properties of cefmetazole transported into bile.\r"

Twelve patients (mean age, 6.6 years; range, 4 months to 14 years) receiving amphotericin B, 0.68 +/- 0.34 mg/kg per day (mean plus or minus standard deviation), were studied. Four to eight blood samples were collected during a 24-h period and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The peak concentration of amphotericin B in serum was 2.9 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml. The mean total clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and elimination half-life were 0.46 +/- 0.20 ml/min per kg, 0.76 +/- 0.52 liters/kg, and 18.1 +/- 6.6 h, respectively. Total clearance decreased with age (p less than 0.01). In children aged 8 months to 9 years, the mean total clearance was 0.57 +/- 0.15 ml/min per kg, and in children older than 9 years, it was 0.24 +/- 0.02 ml/min per kg. Interpatient variation in the clearance and volume of distribution of amphotericin B was greater than threefold and greater than eightfold, respectively. However, pharmacokinetic parameters did not change in two stable patients who were studied again. Because clearance decreased substantially with age, older children may require lower doses of amphotericin B per kilogram to decrease the potential for toxicity.\r"

Corresponding values for area under the serum concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity were 38.3 +/- 14.5, 42.8 +/- 13.9, 38.5 +/- 9.8, and 41.6 +/- 16.7 micrograms.h/ml. There was a trend toward increased concentrations in serum and area under the curve of cefixime when it was administered concomitantly with antacid; however, these differences were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05; analysis of variance). We conclude that single-dose administration of an aluminum-magnesium antacid does not significantly decrease the oral bioavailability of cefixime.\r"

Animals were infused with gentamicin over a 6-h period and achieved individual steady-state levels in serum ranging from 0.5 to 12 micrograms/ml. Young rats were about 3 months old, and old rats were about 6 months old. The steady-state elevation of concentrations of gentamicin in serum was associated with a linear increase of the cortical concentrations in both groups. However, the accumulation of gentamicin was lower in the renal cortex of the old rats than in the renal cortex of the young rats. We conclude that the intrarenal uptake of gentamicin is modified during aging. Further studies must be undertaken to better understand the role of age on the mechanism of uptake and the toxicity of aminoglycosides.\r"

From response rates (66% to 98%), we estimated the actual total number of cases to be 333, and the incidence of toxic epidermal necrolysis in France to 1.2 cases per million per year. An independent estimation derived from death certificates gave a figure of 1.3 cases per million per year. When the number of cases with a given drug present were related to the defined daily doses of that drug sold over the 5-year period, the highest ratios were for sulfadiazin (230.10(-8], isoxica (41.10(-8], oxyphenbutazone (18.10(-8], phenytoin (14.10(-8], fenbufen (13.10(-8], and cotrimoxazole (12.10(-8].

HLA-DQw3 was also increased in patients, 58% vs 32% for controls and may be explained in part by linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR4. When patients were subgrouped according to family history of autoimmune disease and compared with controls, the increase in HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQw3 segregated with a positive family history. HLA-DRw6 in patients with a negative family history of autoimmune disease (64%) was significantly greater than the 10% in patients with a positive family history. When patients were subgrouped according to age at onset of disease, HLA-DR4 was increased in those with early onset of disease (younger than 20 years) while HLA-DRw6 was greater in patients who were older at onset of disease. These findings support the hypothesis of an immunogenetic influence on the expression of vitiligo in black patients with vitiligo.\r"

A patient with a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis manifest as palpable purpura had four lesions encircled on the day of presentation. Biopsies of these lesions were obtained sequentially at 0, 24, 48, and 120 hours. The histopathologic specimens were graded without knowledge of the timing of the biopsy. The character of the infiltrate progressively changed from a neutrophilic-predominant to a mononuclear-predominant infiltrate supporting the theory of a dynamic process in cutaneous vasculitis.

  ".U": "90120667\r", 
  ".W": "Epidermolysis bullosa represents a grouping of inherited skin diseases characterized by epidermal fragility and frequently wounded skin. The recessive dystrophic subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is characterized by extensive dermal scarring after healing of repeated epidermal injuries and by an unusually high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma occurring in chronically wounded skin. In contrast, the simplex form of epidermolysis bullosa usually heals without scarring and does not predispose to malignant neoplasms of the skin. The differences in scarring and the neoplastic potential of these two forms of epidermolysis bullosa prompted us to investigate growth activation and differentiation characteristics in epidermal keratinocytes in individuals with these disorders. The expression of filaggrin, involucrin, cytokeratins, and the growth activation marker psi-3 was examined by immunohistochemistry in skin biopsy specimens from four individuals with epidermolysis bullosa simplex and six individuals with RDEB. Previous experiments using this technique have demonstrated that these antibodies are good markers for identifying growth-activated keratinocytes in wounded and hyperplastic epidermis. All biopsy specimens of healed wounds in skin from patients with RDEB showed epidermis that reacted with antibodies to filaggrin, involucrin, specific cytokeratins, and psi-3 in a growth-activated pattern. This growth-activated phenotype was maintained in keratinocytes from previously wounded skin that had been healed for more than 2 years. The RDEB growth-activated phenotype detected by immunohistochemistry was not associated with microscopically detectable epidermal hyperplasia. In contrast, all cases of epidermolysis bullosa simplex examined showed an epidermal phenotype similar to that of keratinocytes in normal skin. Thus, healing with dermal scar formation in RDEB is associated with a persistent growth-activated immunophenotype of epidermal keratinocytes. This chronic growth activation state or failure of cells to differentiate in a normal fashion may be directly linked to the high incidence of squamous cell cancers in individuals with RDEB.\r"

Fatigue, eye irritation, rhinitis, throat irritation, nausea, and diarrhea were statistically elevated in rates adjusted for age, sex, and race and were reported 60-100% more frequently by respondents living or working near sprayed cotton fields than by the comparison group.

Measurement of total dust concentration and analysis of dust composition were also conducted. Most workers in the jute mill were exposed to jute dusts containing less than 5% silica, whereas a few workers were exposed to dusts containing approximately 10-15% silica. Male smokers and nonsmokers in the dust-exposed group had a higher prevalence of cough and chest tightness compared with those in the control group. Among dust-exposed workers, female nonsmokers had a significantly higher prevalence of cough, chronic bronchitis, chest tightness, and dyspnea than those in the control group. Lung function tests showed that dust-exposed workers had a greater incidence of abnormal lung function than did control workers, as measured by percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), and FEV1.0/FVC. Dust exposure was the main cause of respiratory symptoms and abnormal values of FEV1.0, but both cigarette smoking and dust exposure contributed to the abnormal values reported for FEV1.0.\r"

Such markers fall into two discrete classes: (1) those quantitatively related to the exposure itself, reflecting the magnitude of such exposures or the body burden of the pollutants, and (2) those markers that reflect the biological response to such exposures. In this paper we discuss the use of biochemical and biological markers in epidemiologic studies. Methods are presented for the use of markers to decrease misclassification errors in exposure studies. Relationships are derived that give minimum required values for laboratory sensitivity and specificity. Markers are also discussed in terms of some of the inherent problems in their use (e.g., ethical and legal considerations) and the likelihood of acceptance by participants in epidemiologic studies, researchers, regulators, and health professionals.\r"

Percutaneous or cutdown cannulation sites were: femoral vein-femoral artery (n = 18), right internal jugular vein-femoral artery (n = 2), right atrium-ascending aorta (n = 12), or a combination approach (n = 4). Two patients could not be cannulated. Patient diagnoses were pulmonary emboli (n = 3), failed coronary angioplasty (n = 7), myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock (n = 5), trauma (n = 7), aortic stenosis (n = 2), postcardiotomy deterioration (n = 10), deterioration after cardiac transplantation (n = 2), cardiomyopathy with shock (n = 1), and ruptured ascending aortic dissection (n = 1). Ninety-five percent of patients (36 of 38) were successfully resuscitated to a stable rhythm. Eight diagnostic procedures (coronary angiography, n = 4; pulmonary angiography, n = 3; and aortography, n = 1) were performed while patients were on cardiopulmonary support. Early deaths resulted from massive hemorrhage (n = 8), inability to cannulate (n = 2), and irreversible myocardial injury (n = 10). Sixty-six percent (24 of 36) of patients successfully cannulated underwent conversion to standard cardiopulmonary bypass with attendant operative procedure or placement of ventricular assist device or total artificial heart. Fifty percent (18 of 36) of patients cannulated were successfully weaned from cardiopulmonary support, and 17% (6/36) are long-term survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The operative findings in 9 patients undergoing reoperation were also examined. Preoperative left AV valve insufficiency was significantly more common in the group with late left AV valve incompetence, as were associated valvular malformations as a whole and fenestrations of valve leaflets in particular. Conversely, the higher incidence of malformed or malpositioned papillary muscles, accessory clefts, and double-orifice left AV valves in the group with late left AV valve insufficiency did not reach significance. The method of surgical treatment of the septal commissure was not a significant factor. In the group having reoperation, additional valvular malformations were found in association with inappropriate treatment of the septal commissure in 7 patients. The 2 remaining patients had either a directly sutured ostium primum or dilatation of the annulus. Three re-repairs were successful. Five patients required prosthetic valve replacement. Preoperative left AV valve insufficiency and associated valvular malformations are major determinants of late left AV valve insufficiency in partial AV septal defect.\r"

Twenty-two patients with severe respiratory failure died within a month, 3 during operation. Fourteen patients with negative transbronchial biopsy and 19 with failure of treatment based on transbronchial biopsy died within a year. Six were alive and 5 were lost to follow-up. The most common organism found in patients with severe respiratory failure was Pneumocystis carinii alone or with other pathogens. Successful therapeutic change based on OLB findings was possible in only 1 (1.5%) of the 66 patients. Open lung biopsy has limited application in the management of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In patients with overt pulmonary failure, OLB is invariably fatal. Those seen with suspicious lung infiltrates without risk factors or with known risk factors and negative transbronchial biopsy results might benefit from OLB. In our institution, 18 of 64 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome admissions underwent OLB in 1983, whereas in 1987, only 2 of 302 patients admitted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome had OLB.\r"

In 3 of these patients, Candida either was cultured from the suture line or was seen in the wall of the aorta at postmortem examination. In 2 of these 3 patients, cultures of material from the donor trachea taken at the time of explanation grew Candida species. Two patients were seen with sudden massive hemorrhage on postoperative day 26 and postoperative day 28. One patient experienced acute decompensation due to right ventricular outflow tract obstruction on postoperative day 30, and the remaining patient was seen 7 months postoperatively with obstruction of both the left main bronchus and the right pulmonary artery caused by extrinsic compression by an aortic pseudoaneurysm. A high index of suspicion should be maintained when transplanting lungs containing Candida species, as we believe there is substantial evidence of donor transmission of the fungal agents. We now include amphotericin B in our antibiotic prophylactic regimen in an attempt to prevent fungal infection because previous treatment has been uniformly unsuccessful. Furthermore, we wrap both the trachea and the aorta with omentum to lessen the likelihood of mediastinal spread of infection to the aortic suture line.\r"

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 35 mL/kg/min, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, and an intraaortic double-balloon pump were studied alone or in combination. Left ventricular oxygen consumption, SSI, and Ees were measured before and during mechanical circulatory assistance. Left ventricular oxygen consumption was calculated from transit-time measurements of left main coronary artery blood flow and fiberoptic measurements of coronary sinus blood oxygen saturation. Three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals placed across three orthogonal ventricular axes were used to calculate instantaneous ventricular volumes and pressure-volume loops from which the SSI data were derived. The Ees was measured using a new single-beat aortic occlusive method. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation alone increased SSI and did not change Ees in postischemic poorly contracting hearts. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation alone significantly reduced SSI and increased Ees. The combination of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and either the intraaortic balloon pump or the intraaortic double-balloon pump reduced SSI, increased Ees, and reduced left ventricular oxygen consumption. In postischemic dilated, poorly contracting hearts, the combination of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation has important advantages over extracorporeal membrane oxygenation alone.\r"

  ".W": "Prolactin, a pituitary hormone, has been shown to have an active role in the regulation of the immune system. Prolactin receptors have been described on the membrane of lymphocyte cells, and competitive binding to these receptors by cyclosporine and circulating prolactin has been demonstrated. Experimental evidence suggests a synergistic effect of cyclosporine and bromocriptine, an inhibitor of pituitary release of prolactin, on immunosuppression. Between July 1986 and January 1988, 54 patients were randomly assigned to two groups of immunosuppression treatment. Thirty patients (group 1) were administered cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone and 24 patients (group 2), a modified protocol aimed at decreasing the level of circulating prolactin by adding bromocriptine to the immunosuppression regimen. The two groups were similar in regard to age, preoperative diagnosis, and duration of follow-up. Minimal side effects related to bromocriptine were observed. The overall incidences of rejection and infection were similar, although actuarial analysis showed that freedom from these complications among patients treated with bromocriptine was significantly higher throughout the first 2 months after heart transplantation compared with that of patients in the control group. Other variables such as serum cyclosporine levels and lymphocyte counts were similar in both groups. In conclusion, suppression of circulating prolactin by bromocriptine appears to improve the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine, at least during the early postoperative period when the risk of rejection and infection is higher, and could be a promising avenue to successful hormonal manipulations of the immune process after organ transplantation.\r"

A fibrin glue spray was used in 14 patients, and 14 patients served as controls. Assignment of either group was made before thoracotomy. Nine male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 63.8 years were in the fibrin glue experimental group, and 8 male and 6 female patients with a mean age of 59 years, in the control group. An equal number of complete and incomplete fissures were in each group. All fissures were handled in the same way (stapled). Two milliliters of fibrin glue was applied through a double-syringe delivery system and sprayed on the staple line and any cut surface of the inflated lung just before thoracotomy closure. The fibrin glue-treated group had a mean air leak duration of 2.3 +/- 3.7 days, chest tube drains for 6 +/- 4.1 days, and a postoperative hospitalization of 9.8 +/- 3.1 days. The control group had a mean air leak duration of 3.3 +/- 3.3 days (p = 0.94), chest tube drains for 5.9 +/- 3.9 days (p = 0.95), and a postoperative hospitalization of 11.5 +/- 3.9 days (p = 0.21). We conclude that the routine use of a fixed quantity of fibrin glue is not effective in reducing the duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage, or hospitalization after uncomplicated pulmonary lobectomy.\r"

  ".W": "When esophageal disruption occurs in the presence of preexisting esophageal disease or is associated with sepsis or fluid and electrolyte imbalance, aggressive and definitive therapy often provides the only chance for patient salvage. Twenty-four adults (average age, 59 years) with intrathoracic esophageal perforations underwent esophagectomy: 15, transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy; and 9, transthoracic esophagectomy. Restoration of alimentary continuity with an immediate cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was carried out in 13 patients. Eleven underwent a cervical or anterior thoracic esophagostomy, and 10 of them had a subsequent colonic (7) or gastric (3) interposition from 4 to 32 weeks (average time, 8.6 weeks) later. The perforations were due to esophageal instrumentation (9 patients), acute caustic ingestion (2), emesis (2), intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomotic disruption (2), and other causes (9). Preexisting esophageal disease in 20 patients included chronic strictures (10 patients), reflux esophagitis (3), esophageal cancer (3), achalasia (2), diffuse spasm (2), and monilial esophagitis (1 patient). Ten patients were operated on within 12 hours after the injury; 3, within 12 to 24 hours; and 11, within three to 45 days (average interval, 6.6 days). There were three hospital deaths (13%). Nineteen of the 21 survivors were able to swallow comfortably until the time of death or latest follow-up. Aggressive diagnosis and aggressive treatment of life-threatening esophageal perforations are advocated. Conservative procedures (repair, diversion, or drainage) for a perforation with preexisting esophageal disease often inflict more morbidity than esophageal resection, which eliminates the perforation, the source of sepsis, and the underlying esophageal disease. The decision to restore alimentary continuity in a single stage must be individualized.\r"

  ".W": "Lung transplantation is now a clinical reality in adults but is limited by the scarcity of appropriate donors. The donor shortage is even more acute for neonatal and pediatric patients. Reduced-size lung grafts would expand the pool of appropriate cadaveric donors and allow HLA-matched living related lobar or segmental lung transplants. To evaluate this experimentally, we developed a model of pulmonary lobar transplantation in neonatal pigs and studied the acute hemodynamic response after transplanting the left lower lobe from a more mature donor to a neonatal recipient. Technical considerations included using the recipient atrial appendage for the pulmonary venous anastomosis. Nine pairs of pigs underwent left lateral thoracotomy. The recipient left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary vascular resistance were measured before pneumonectomy and after left lower lobe transplantation. Although the left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures remained unchanged after transplantation, there was a 15% increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and a 23% reduction in cardiac output. Neither change was statistically significant. The distribution of blood flow through the left and right pulmonary arteries was unchanged after transplantation. We conclude that lobar transplantation is technically feasible in immature animals and that the pulmonary venous anastomosis to the left atrial appendage facilitates the procedure. This model may prove useful in studying lung transplantation in immature recipients and expedite implementation of reduced-size lung transplantation in neonatal and pediatric patients.\r"

One hundred forty-seven tumors were excised (74%): 132 (66%) by resection and primary reconstruction, seven by laryngotracheal resection or cervicomediastinal exenteration, and eight by staged procedures. Eleven more were explored. Forty-four squamous cell carcinomas were resected, 60 adenoid cystic, and 43 assorted tumors, benign and malignant. Eighty-two patients underwent tracheal resection with primary reconstruction, and 50 had carinal resection and reconstruction. Surgical mortality for resection with primary reconstruction was 5%, with one death after tracheal and six after carinal repair. Six patients had stenosis after tracheal or carinal resection; all underwent reresection successfully. Nearly all patients with squamous or adenoid cystic carcinoma were irradiated postoperatively. Twenty of 41 survivors of resection of squamous cell carcinoma are living free of disease (some for more than 25 years), 39 of 52 with adenoid cystic carcinoma (up to nearly 19 years), and 35 of 42 with other lesions (5 lost to follow-up). Comparison of length of survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma who are alive without disease with those who died with carcinoma supports surgical treatment (usually followed by irradiation). Positive lymph nodes or invasive disease at resection margins appear to have an adverse effect on cure of squamous cell carcinoma; such an effect is not demonstrable with adenoid cystic carcinoma.\r"

Dogs were randomized into three groups: group 1 (n = 6), control; group 2 (n = 7), steroids; and group 3 (n = 6), steroids with cerebrospinal fluid drainage. During aortic cross-clamping, blood pressure proximal to the clamp decreased significantly in each group compared with baseline (p less than 0.05), but did not differ among groups (group 1 = 82.2, group 2 = 82.1, group 3 = 86.6 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05). Mean distal pressure decreased from systemic values to 8.4, 8.5, and 3.7 mm Hg, respectively, after aortic cross-clamping (p less than 0.05); these values did not differ from one another (p greater than 0.05). During aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid pressure in groups 1 and 2 did not differ significantly compared with baseline (12.2 versus 8.2, 14.2 versus 10.7 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05), whereas in group 3 the baseline cerebral spinal fluid pressure of 10.7 mm Hg decreased to 0.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Spinal cord perfusion pressure in group 3 was significantly higher than in groups 1 and 2 (3.3 versus -3.9 and -5.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), but did not differ between groups 1 and 2 (p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90120746\r", 
  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of an institutional experience with aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients 70 years of age or older during 1976 to 1987 was performed. The study was prompted in part by the current interest in palliative aortic valvoplasty, an interest based to a certain extent on the impression that AVR in the elderly has a high mortality. The mean age of the patients was 75.0 +/- 4.0 years (+/- the standard deviation) (range, 70 to 89 years). Eighty-three percent of patients received porcine valves and 17%, mechanical valves. Preoperatively 32% were in New York Heart Association class III, and 59% were in class IV. Operative mortality was 5.6% for elective isolated AVR for aortic stenosis (19% of all patients), 8.2% for all isolated AVR (38%), and 12.4% overall. Concomitant operative procedures were done in 62.0%; AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting (42%) had an operative mortality of 14.3%. Multivariate analysis showed significant predictors of operative mortality to be emergency operation (p less than 0.01), isolated aortic regurgitation (p = 0.01), and previous cardiac operation (p = 0.02). Follow-up (34 +/- 27 months) was 94% complete. Five-year survival from late cardiac-related death was 81.0%. The constant yearly hazard rate for late death for patients 70 years of age or older who underwent AVR was 5.42% per year, which is similar to the 5.77% per year rate calculated for age-matched and sex-matched controls. Five-year freedom from reoperation was 99%; from late thromboembolic complications, 91%; and from late anticoagulant-related complications, 94%. Freedom from all valve-related morbidity and mortality was 61% at 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We reviewed the records of 127 patients undergoing either AICD procedures or resection over a 6-year period. Thirty-day mortality was 5.6% (5/89 patients) for all AICD procedures, 10.7% (3/28) for AICD placement plus coronary artery bypass grafting, and 11.8% (4/34) for resection. These mortality figures are not significantly different. Patients undergoing resection were less likely to require antiarrhythmic agents than patients given an AICD (33% versus 61%). Survival at 2 years was 78% in the resection group and 72% in the AICD group. Survival at 4 years was still 78% in the resection group. Only 1 late sudden death occurred in the AICD group and none in the resection group. We conclude that resection continues to be a valuable alternative, offering a greater overall benefit at only slightly increased risk.\r"

Over the 3-year interval of the retrospective study, there were no differences in glycohemoglobin values between the groups. We conclude that self-monitoring of blood glucose levels alone did not improve the mean amount of glycemia in these patients. Alternative strategies must be developed for use in concert with self-monitoring technology to improve its effectiveness.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups with high, moderate, or low suspicion of malignant neoplasms on clinical grounds without previous knowledge of cytologic or histologic results. Histologic examination revealed an overall malignant neoplasm rate of 23%; the rate was 71%, 14%, and 11% for the groups with high, moderate, and low suspicion, respectively. The FNAB diagnostic interpretations of malignant and uncertain were considered positive. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for FNAB were 92%, 71%, and 75%, respectively. Sensitivity in the high-, moderate-, and low-suspicion groups was 95%, 89%, and 88%, respectively; specificity was 88%, 72%, and 67%, respectively; and accuracy was 93%, 75%, and 69%, respectively. In our opinion, all patients in the group with high clinical suspicion need surgical treatment whatever the FNAB result; those with lower degrees of clinical suspicion and malignant or uncertain FNAB result [corrected] should also undergo surgery.\r"

Questionnaires were mailed to 236 state-registered facilities. Two hundred nine nursing homes (88.5%) responded to the questionnaire; 83% reported having a written policy, and half (86 nursing homes) provided copies. Nine of ten nursing homes reported that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed at their institution, and a similar number (92%) permitted physician orders restricting cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Written policies were systematically compared with 10 model criteria. Policy content varied substantially. More than half of the policies contained provisions for authorization, informed consent, documentation, competency, review, and applicability of do not resuscitate orders. Less than half contained criteria for autonomy, treatment alternatives, dignity and quality of care, and patient identification. Nursing homes that had written policies were newer, larger, and for-profit; had a greater proportion of skilled nursing care beds; and were more likely to have both Medicare and Medicaid certification. The variations in these policies place nursing home residents at risk for having important personal rights limited or ignored. Inclusion of these 10 policy criteria in a comprehensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation policy would represent an important step toward enhancing the quality of decision making by nursing home residents.\r"

The results demonstrated that age, sex, and smoking had no major effects on limb TcPo2 or disease severity; however, both limb TcPo2 and clinical disease severity were adversely affected by diabetes. When limbs with similar occlusive disease severity were compared, TcPo2 remained consistently lower in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients. We conclude that diabetes causes a reduction in limb TcPo2 beyond that which can be accounted for by large-vessel arterial occlusive disease alone.\r"

We investigated whether these factors together could prevent the lipid-raising effects of dietary cholesterol. Ten healthy, athletic, normolipidemic male volunteers were studied. Two diets of 4 weeks duration each were compared in a randomized, blind crossover design. Diets were identical except for cholesterol content: one contained 600 mg/d; the other 200 mg/d. Both diets contained 15% of calories as protein, 55% as carbohydrate, 30% as fat, and the polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio was 1.5. Exercise level and body weight were kept constant in each subject. As compared with plasma values obtained following the 200-mg/d cholesterol diet, mean values following the 600-mg/d cholesterol diet significantly increased for LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by 10% and 13%, respectively. Mean plasma triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein 2 and 3, and apolipoprotein A-1 levels did not change significantly. Individual responses, however, were highly variable. Three subjects increased LDL cholesterol by more than 25%; 2 subjects increased LDL cholesterol by 10% to 25%; and 5 subjects had 5% or less change in LDL cholesterol. A dietary cholesterol increase can significantly elevate plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in certain normolipidemic, healthy men even when they are exercising regularly and consuming a moderately fat restricted, low saturated fat diet. Dietary cholesterol restriction may therefore be justifiable even when other life-style and dietary measures to minimize blood cholesterol are undertaken.\r"

Training deficits most frequently recalled were office management skills and psychosocial/communication skills. Nearly half of the respondents preferred to maintain separate certificates.

The mode of presentation varied from an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis that cleared completely when exposure ceased to progressive severe interstitial fibrosis of the lungs. In one subject reexposure was followed by a recurrence of the symptoms. All subjects showed restrictive ventilatory impairment and a reduction of their diffusing capacity. The radiologic appearances varied greatly. While two subjects had clear roentgenograms with small lung volumes, others had a micronodular pattern or small blotchy nodular infiltrates, and one had diffuse reticulonodulation as is seen in cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. The pathologic appearances varied between desquamative interstitial pneumonia and overt mural fibrosis of the alveoli. Six of the seven patients had multinucleated giant cells in their biopsy specimens or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\r"

Patients were divided into eight cohorts by age; for each, odds ratios were computed to compare cancer patients with patients who have benign disease and with control subjects for positive family history of breast cancer. For both sets of comparisons, odds ratios are highest for subjects from 30 to 34 years old. After the age of 45 years, odds ratios decline, and after age 60 years the odds of breast cancer occurring in women with a positive family history are no greater than it is in women without such a history. These results suggest that a family history of breast cancer is a determinant of breast cancer only for women under age 60 years. The mechanism through which this is effected needs to be studied.\r"

Estimates of proportions based on responses at the clinic examination were also projected to the demographics of the household survey. The estimated proportions of individuals who are sexually active are 73.8% for married men and 55.8% for married women; among unmarried men and women the proportions are 31.1% and 5.3%, respectively. The levels decrease significantly with age in both genders. The estimated proportion of married men with erectile impotence is 35.3%. Significant associations were observed between having problems with mobility and the lack of sexual activity in both genders. The prevalence of impotency was significantly associated with a history of heart attack, urinary incontinence, and the use of sedatives. The consumption of at least one cup of coffee per day was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of sexual activity in women and with a higher potency rate in men.\r"

Three internists made individual assessments of conjunctivae, face, nails, palms, and palmar creases in 98 male and 5 female hospitalized patients at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. The true-positive rates (sensitivities) were highest for pallor at any one of three sites (ie, the conjunctivae, face, or palms; 0.65) and for pallor of the palms (0.53). True-negative rates (specificities) were best for palmar creases (1.00), for pallor at conjunctivae, face, and palms (all three in combination; 0.95), and for the face (0.90). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that the examination of the nailbeds is inferior to all other sites or combinations. Interobserver variability K scores were negative for palmar creases but ranged from .16 to .51 for other sites. We conclude that (1) the absence of pallor does not rule out anemia, and therefore this sign is not useful for screening an asymptomatic population; (2) pallor of the conjunctivae, face, and palms together is of benefit in confirming the presence of anemia; and (3) neither the nailbeds nor palmar creases are of value in assessing the presence or absence of anemia.\r"

We conducted a survey of all US and Canadian public health departments to determine how often students were implicated in outbreaks (response rate, 88.7%). We also performed a literature search to identify any cases not reported to health departments, as well as examined the medical, social, and economic consequences of such outbreaks in the medical setting. Since 1981, 9% of health departments have recorded at least one outbreak of rubella or measles in which medical students were specifically implicated as sources or vectors. Increased morbidity, mortality, and adverse economic consequences resulted from these outbreaks. Our data confirm that medical students are important sources/vectors in rubella and measles outbreaks. We recommend that all medical students be immune to these viruses.\r"

The widespread mumps outbreaks that occurred in Tennessee in 1986-1987 provided an opportunity to assess the extent of the problems caused by mumps in hospitals. Information was obtained from 146 (95%) of 154 infection control practitioners in the state. Infection control problems caused by mumps were reported from 17 (12%) of 146 hospitals. The 17 hospitals in which these incidents occurred were located in counties that accounted for 67% of the reported mumps cases statewide during this period. Although most cases of mumps in health care workers were community-acquired, six health care workers in three different hospitals developed mumps following nosocomial exposure. In two institutions, nine patients contracted mumps while hospitalized. Both were long-term-care facilities housing adolescents, who had substantial contact with a community where mumps outbreaks were ongoing. This study suggests that mumps poses a small but real risk to both patients and staff in hospitals, particularly in long-term-care facilities caring for adolescents and young adults. In communities where mumps activity is ongoing, hospitals should consider identifying potentially susceptible staff members at risk for infection and offering vaccine. Likewise, susceptible patients in long-term-care facilities should be immunized.\r"

At a community hospital in New York, NY, we surveyed 230 attending physicians in a department of medicine to determine their attitudes toward the care of patients with AIDS. Factor analysis produced three clusters of attitudes termed antipathy, liability, and isolation. These factors, together with physicians' \"knowledge\" and background, were analyzed as predictors of treating patients with AIDS. While antipathy, isolation, and fear of acquiring AIDS were not predictors, liability scores were inversely correlated with the likelihood of treating the disease (r = -.18). Liability was influenced by patients' attitudes toward AIDS. Primary care physicians had higher liability and isolation scores than subspecialists and were more likely to see support groups, guaranteed funding, and education as incentives to treat patients with AIDS. Further study is needed to target measures that support primary care physicians in their care of patients with this disease.\r"

Results showed general agreement in the anticoagulation decision regarding patients with either mitral valve disease or a history of chronic alcohol abuse, but substantial disagreement in other categories of patients. Estimations of the risk of embolization and risk of hemorrhage differed widely among all physicians, cardiologists generally rating the embolization risks lower than the other physicians. A physician's treatment decision was strongly related to the relative risk of embolism vs hemorrhage derived for each case. A relationship between physician specialty and treatment decision was also demonstrated, with cardiologists least likely, and family practitioners most likely, to institute anticoagulation in nonrheumatic patients with atrial fibrillation. The reason for this variation appears to be differences in the estimated risk of systemic embolism.\r"

The duration of methadone maintenance was 16.9 +/- 0.5 years, and the median dose of methadone was 60 mg (range, 5 to 100 mg). Before methadone treatment, the patients had abused heroin parenterally for 10.3 +/- 1.7 years, and they had engaged in additional high-risk practices for HIV infection.

The relationship between ambulation status and scoliosis was analyzed with a stepwise series of chi square analyses, assuming increasing time intervals between wheelchair dependency and scoliosis. Wheelchair dependency and scoliosis were both age-related phenomena. The relationship between ambulation status and scoliosis became significant only after 3.5 years of wheelchair dependency. It should be noted that 24% of boys with scoliosis developed their curves before cessation of ambulation. While development of scoliosis among DMD boys is clearly an age-related phenomenon, its previously assumed relationship to ambulation requires reevaluation.\r"

Predominant upper extremity weakness was proximal in 4%, distal in 36%, and generalized in the remainder. Forty-one percent also had significant lower limb weakness. More than 90% of the patients experienced neurologic recovery of upper and/or lower limb strength. After an average acute hospitalization of 30 days and a mean rehabilitation stay of 70 days, most patients performed each of 14 functional skills independently, 84% had bladder continence, and 89% were discharged home. Statistically significant improvements were noted for mean Modified Barthel Index scores between rehabilitation admission and discharge. Favorable rehabilitation outcomes were associated most frequently with younger age, preinjury employment, absence of lower extremity impairment on admission, and documented upper or lower extremity strength recovery during rehabilitation. Central cord syndrome generally has a good prognosis for neurologic and functional improvement during rehabilitation.\r"

The sphincter was injected with either a low dose of botulinum A toxin or normal saline once per week for three weeks. Electromyography of the external urethral sphincter indicated denervation in the three patients who received toxin injections. The urethral pressure profile decreased an average of 25cm of water, postvoiding residual volume of urine decreased an average of 125cc, and bladder pressure during voiding decreased to an average of 30cm of water. Bulbosphincteric reflexes were more difficult to obtain, and they showed a decreased amplitude with normal latency. In the two patients who received normal saline injections, parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injection with botulinum A toxin once per week for three weeks when their responses were similar to those of the other three patients. Mild generalized weakness lasting two to three weeks was noted by three patients after initial toxin injections. The duration of the toxin's effect averaged two months. The results suggest that botulinum A toxin, an inhibitor of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, may be useful in the treatment of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.\r"

One of its few contraindications is the presence of a cardiac pacemaker. Clinicians have recommended that cardiac monitoring be performed for a short interrupted period during the first application of TENS to ensure safety. We present two patients who were given trials of TENS for different chronic pain complaints. In both cases, electrocardiograms during the TENS trial did not reveal cardiac pacemaker dysfunction, but extended cardiac monitoring with the Holter monitor showed interference with pacemaker function. The abnormalities did not recur after reprogramming the sensitivity of the pacemakers. We suggest the use of extended cardiac monitoring for patients with cardiac pacemakers during the prolonged use of TENS to ensure safety and to determine any need for reprogramming of the pacemakers. Patients with cardiac pacemakers should not be excluded from the use of TENS, but careful evaluation and extended cardiac monitoring should be performed.\r"

Laboratory profiles were obtained during the first few weeks postinjury. No persons had below-normal plasma volumes, while 9% had below-normal blood volumes.

Other below-normal values included erythrocyte count (75%), hemoglobin (79%), hematocrit (71%), mean corpuscular volume (11%), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (11%), serum iron (50%), total iron binding capacity (86%), iron saturation (50%), serum total protein (57%), serum albumin (89%), serum globulin (32%), and serum transferrin (79%). Most persons (71%) were found to have normochromic, normocytic anemia, although 14% had normochromic, microcytic anemia. Only 14% did not develop anemia. Although these cases of anemia were not severe enough to require transfusions, they might be an important factor in the development of other secondary complications and may combine with other nutritional and hematologic deficiencies to prolong the rehabilitation process.\r"

  ".W": "The effects, in women, of heel lifts on EMG activity of the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were analyzed to see whether they were different from those of men. Six women who wear high-heeled shoes regularly walked on a level floor with heel heights of zero, 2.5cm, 5.0cm, and 7.5cm. Results showed that as heel height increased, there were significant and progressive decreases in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior EMG activity during walking. This decrease in gastrocnemius EMG activity in women is the same as in men, but the decrease in tibialis anterior EMG activity in women is opposite to that seen in men. The difference in responses of the tibialis anterior muscle between men and women may be related to the habitual use of high-heeled shoes by women. Since raising the heel decreases gastrocnemius muscle activity, thereby reducing tension in the Achilles tendon in both men and women, it was felt that heel lifts may provide a useful adjunct in the management of tendoachilles bursitis, tenosynovitis of the Achilles tendon, and postoperative management of a ruptured Achilles tendon.\r"

For measurement of quadriceps and hamstrings strengths, the CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used. Peak torque values were recorded at low (60 degrees/sec) and high (180 degrees/sec) speeds of isokinetic movement, and the maximal isometric extension and flexion outputs were measured with the knee at a 60 degree angle. Three standardized knee scoring scales were used to determine the subjective, functional, clinical, and radiologic outcome of the injured knees. In every test, great intersubject variation of the HQ ratio was observed, even in healthy knees (range 19% to 148%). Follow-up scores of the groups with low (less than 50%), optimal (50% to 80%), or high (greater than 80%) HQ ratios of the injured knees did not differ significantly from each other. However, in every test the scores were significantly (p less than 0.001 to less than 0.0001) better in patients whose injured knee HQ ratio was nearly identical (less than or equal to 15%) rather than clearly different from (greater than 15%) the uninjured knee. These findings confirm our previous observation that the HQ ratio is an idiosyncratic parameter. Any general recommendation about optimal value is difficult to give. In evaluating long-term outcome, the most ideal HQ ratio of an injured knee seems to be the HQ ratio of the opposite, healthy extremity.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of local steroid injection on the recovery of nerve conduction in acute compression neuropathy. Experimental neuropathy with complete conduction block was produced by mechanical compression of the caudal nerves of 24 rats. Five days after compression, the compression site was injected with 0.2 mL Dexamethasone acetate (8 mg/mL suspension) in eight rats (group A), and 0.2 mL normal saline in another eight rats (group B). The remaining eight rats (group C) received no injection. Motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) over the compressed segment, as well as amplitude of the evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recorded from the segmental tail muscles, were measured before nerve compression and three times per week after nerve compression. The recovery rates of NCV of the caudal nerve were not significantly different among the three groups. The recovery rate of amplitude of CMAP in group A was significantly higher than that in groups B or C (p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in recovery rate of the amplitude of CMAP between groups B and C. It is concluded that local steroid injection to the site of nerve compression may facilitate the recovery of nerve conduction block but not the recovery of demyelinative lesion.\r"

Although risk factors for falls have been described for acute care and geriatric settings, data from the rehabilitation setting are sparse. To provide a descriptive epidemiology, incident reports of falls were reviewed at a 151-bed rehabilitation facility. Of 567 patients admitted between January 1 and December 31, 1984, 71 (12.5%) experienced at least one fall; most (75%) of the falls occurred in patients using wheelchairs. Risk for falls was associated with increasing age (p less than 0.05), a diagnosis of stroke, or lower extremity amputation (p less than 0.05). Of the 71 fallers, 31% experienced repeat falls which tended to occur more frequently with older age, disorientation, and nonambulatory status at first fall. Nearly 13% sustained injuries, which tended to occur more frequently among disoriented and wheelchair or bedfast patients. These data suggest that groups of patients who are at high risk for falls within the rehabilitation setting can be identified for the purposes of prevention, and targeted for preventive measures.\r"

Radiolabeled heparin studies revealed significant tritium delivery to the cornea, aqueous, and iris, with only trace levels detectable for the lens, vitreous, and sclera. An aqueous fibrin inhibition assay revealed that a single collagen shield soaked in heparin achieved anterior chamber anticoagulant levels that paralleled the time course of the radiolabeled heparin delivery and resulted in fibrin inhibition during the 6-hour study period. Subconjunctival heparin injection did not alter baseline aqueous anticoagulant activity. No complications related to collagen shield heparin delivery were encountered. These studies suggest that a heparin-hydrated collagen shield may prevent postoperative fibrin formation in eyes at risk for this complication, including eyes undergoing surgery for the complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and glaucoma filtration surgery.\r"

Lipofuscin and cytoplasm contained only phosphorus and sulfur in detectable amounts. Drusen, when present, contained phosphorus and calcium. Six eyes had a prominent aluminum peak recorded from melanosomes, nuclei, and Bruch's membrane. In one pair of 90-year-old eyes, small, electron-dense deposits surrounded many melanosomes and contained mercury and selenium.

Medial canthal tendon publications have been advocated but they do not achieve adequate posterior and medial placement of the medial canthal angle and they lack permanence. One of us (R.L.A.) has developed a surgical technique for correcting these problems that is a modification of the lateral tarsal strip procedure used to correct lateral canthal tendon laxity and malposition. The medial tarsal strip procedure repositions and tightens the medial lower or upper eyelid, establishing a normal anatomic appearance. Its use is indicated in cases of medial canthal malposition or marked medial ectropion associated with a nonfunctioning canalicular system or in those cases in which loss of function of a patent canaliculus is acceptable or desirable. The advantages of the medial tarsal strip are as follows: (1) surgery is directed at the site of the defect; (2) recurrence of canthal tendon laxity and elongation is avoided; (3) a more medial and posterior positioning of the medial eyelid can be obtained; (4) any amount of eyelid laxity can be corrected simultaneously; (5) the almond-shaped canthal angle is preserved or reestablished; and (6) the procedure is fast and easily performed.\r"

After a transient period of faint haze, all corneas were clear at 17 weeks and remained clear through the 1-year follow-up. In terms of accuracy, all corneas demonstrated a significant flattening compared with preoperative values, but no significant difference was seen between the groups with different intended corrections (1.5 and 3 diopters). The changes in corneal shape stabilized by 17 weeks, as measured by keratometry. The clinical results suggest that mechanical removal of the epithelium is preferable to laser ablation of the epithelium. Overall, the results demonstrate that excimer laser ablation of the corneal stroma can produce a stable diptric change in the primate cornea with good healing and long-term corneal clarity.\r"

The optic discs of blacks were larger and more oval than those of whites, though the axial lengths of the eyes in the two groups were not significantly different. Women's eyes and discs were smaller than those of men, possibly explaining the smaller cup-disc ratio in women. Larger optic discs and optic nerves have more optic nerve fibers than do smaller discs and nerves. Oblique insertions of the disc were detected in 18% of eyes. These were predominantly centered in the inferior disc and were more commin in white women.\r"

Slit-lamp Scheimpflug videography of the lens and slit-lamp goniovideography of the lens equator, zonule, and ciliary body allowed direct real-time observation and video recording of the movements of these structures during centrally stimulated accommodation and during disaccommodation. Scalloping of the lens capsule at the zonular insertion sites was clearly visible during disaccommodation and even during accommodation when the zonules were folded. During accommodation, the lens became axially thicker, the ciliary ring narrowed, and, at high levels of accommodation, the zonular fibers slackened and even folded and the lens moved downward. With increasing age and concomitantly decreasing accommodative amplitude, these excursions all diminished, so that in the oldest animals, they were very minimal or absent. Maximum centrally stimulated accommodative amplitude declined with age on a time scale similar to that for cholinomimetic drug-induced accommodation in the rhesus monkey and voluntary accommodation in the human.\r"

The final study design that evolved included two baseline visits, when skin test-positive subjects were administered a bilateral ocular allergen challenge. At the first visit, the threshold dose of reactivity was determined by increasing allergen doses at 10-minute intervals. At the second baseline visit, 3 days later, the responsive subjects were challenged with the final, highest dose used on visit 1 to assure that the allergic reaction was reproducible and not a cumulative effect of multiple allergen doses. The responsive subjects then returned 3 days later for the drug efficacy evaluation. After a slit-lamp examination, subjects were pretreated with the test drug in one eye and the placebo in the fellow eye in a randomized, double-masked fashion. After 10 minutes, subjects were challenged bilaterally with the allergen dose identified on the previous visits. Postchallenge evaluations of hyperemia, itching, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing were performed at 3, 10, and 20 minutes. Subjects were rechallenged 4 hours after drug administration to assess duration of action. Slit-lamp examinations were again performed at the same intervals as after the initial challenge. A total of 396 subjects were given a baseline allergen challenge; 83.6% responded with a moderate (2+) ocular allergic reaction. Of the 266 given a second baseline challenge, 87.2% responded positively again, suggesting that ocular challenge was highly correlated with skin reactivity and reproducible with a second challenge. No statistically significant difference in redness and itching was found when both eyes were challenged with the same dose of allergen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because others have reported only occasional ocular involvement, we reviewed the ophthalmologic findings in our 24 patients with primary hyperoxaluria to document its funduscopic variability and to determine its visual prognosis and its possible systemic significance. Eight (30%) of our 24 patients with primary hyperoxaluria exhibited a bilaterally symmetrical retinopathy. The abnormalities were predominantly confined to the posterior pole and ranged from many small (100- to 200-microns) subretinal black ringlets to single large (2- to 3-disc diameter) geographic lesions. In 3 of the 8 patients with oxalate retinopathy, diffuse optic disc pallor was evident. Five patients with both normal-appearing optic discs and oxalate retinopathy had relatively good visual acuities. The maculopathy of primary hyperoxaluria caused mild visual impairment while optic nerve dysfunction associated with this disease appeared to be much visually debilitating. Also, the presence of oxalate maculopathy was associated with a more severe systemic course for the disease.\r"

The septum-posterior wall ratio was increased in the risk groups (NT, BHO, BH). The increased ratio could be explained by both heredity and elevated blood pressure. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) correlated strongly with physical activity in the NT group, so LVMI was adjusted accordingly. The adjusted LVMI was significantly increased in the risk groups. The increase in the adjusted LVMI could best be explained by the elevated blood pressure and not by heredity. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that physical activity is an independent predictor of LVMI only in the NT group and that systolic blood pressure is an independent predictor of LVMI only in the risk groups.\r"

To this aim, 16 borderline hypertensive patients underwent echocardiographic and pulsed-wave Doppler evaluation. As control groups, 20 normotensive controls and 20 patients with established hypertension were evaluated by the same procedure. By the Doppler assessment of transmitral blood flow, the following indices of left ventricular diastolic function were obtained: early (E) and late (A) peak flow velocity, late to early velocity ratio (A/E), early filling fraction (EFF) and acceleration and deceleration times of early and late flow peaks. Borderline hypertensives had an interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness significantly higher than normotensives and lower than established hypertensives. As regards the diastolic indexes, borderline hypertensive patients had significantly higher A peaks (P less than .02) and A/E ratios (P = .05) and lower EFF (P less than .02) as compared to normotensive controls. No significant differences were on the other hand observed with established hypertensive patients. This resultant diastolic pattern was independent of age, as indicated by the analysis of age-matched subgroups. The presence of diastolic function changes in borderline hypertension confirms the early appearance of this kind of abnormality in hypertensive heart disease. On the other hand, the finding of increased left ventricular wall thickness in borderline hypertensives does not allow us to conclude that, as suggested by other authors, diastolic function changes in the early stage of hypertension are independent on anatomical modifications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The parathyroid gland has been causally associated with some forms of hypertension, yet parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been shown to possess hypotensive properties. Recently, we described the presence of a circulating hypertensive factor in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) plasma, the expression of which is associated with a novel cell type in the parathyroid gland. In order to determine whether this hypertensive factor might be produced by the parathyroid gland, the effects of parathyroidectomy and parathyroid transplantation on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and hypertensive factor activity were studied. Parathyroidectomy, but not sham operation, decreased MAP in SHR and resulted in the disappearance of the hypertensive factor from the plasma. Transplantation of SHR parathyroid glands into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats resulted in an increase in MAP and the appearance of the factor in the plasma, whereas transplantation of SD parathyroid glands into SHR had exactly the opposite effect. SD to SD transplantation had no effect on MAP or hypertensive factor activity. Infusions of PTH gave opposite effects to hypertensive factor infusions. These results suggest that the hypertensive factor is parathyroid gland-dependent but is not PTH. On this basis, we have proposed that the factor be referred to as \"Parathyroid Hypertensive Factor,\" or \"PHF.\"\r"

The maximal velocity of the red cells' Na+/H+ (Na+ influx promoted by an outward H+ gradient) and Li+/Na+ (Li+ efflux promoted by external Na+) exchange were therefore measured in 41 EH and in 21 normotensive controls (NT). Both transporters were significantly higher in EH than in NT (74 +/- 39 mmol/L cell x h v 43 +/- 27 for the former, P less than .03, and 0.35 +/- 0.16 v 0.26 +/- 0.10 for the latter, P less than .05). Even though more than 100 times faster, Na+/H+ exchange was weakly but significantly correlated to Li+/Na+ exchange (r = 0.29, P less than .05). Proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption (fractional renal Li+ reabsorption) was significantly greater in EH than in NT (0.78 +/- 0.07, n = 32, v 0.73 +/- 0.06, n = 10, P less than .05) but it was not correlated to either the red cells' Na+/H+ or Li+/Na+ exchanges. Therefore, hyperactivity of Na+/H+ exchange in EH may play a role in blood pressure elevation through mechanisms other than stimulation of renal Na+ reabsorption.\r"

Taurine treatment caused a significant persistent reduction in blood pressure by 4 weeks that was maximal at 16 weeks (146 +/- 6 [exp.] v 182 +/- 5 [control] mm Hg, P less than .01). While this taurine-induced decline in blood pressure in the SHR was not accompanied by alterations in plasma epinephrine levels, there was a steady 235% increment in the norepinephrine concentration from 231 +/- 31 pg/mL initially to 542 +/- 126 pg/mL at completion of the study, P less than .02. The reduction in blood pressure was associated with decreased proteinuria in the taurine-treated SHR (9.6 +/- 4 [exp.] v 21.5 +/- 7 [control] mg/24 h, P less than .02) and less cardiac and renal hypertrophy. We conclude that taurine administration results in a 20 to 25% reduction in blood pressure in the SHR. The mechanism of this hypotensive action requires further study but is independent of changes in plasma catecholamine levels. The vasodepressor effect of taurine leads to less hypertensive injury to the kidney and heart in the SHR.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, exercise capacity was evaluated in patients with borderline and established, uncomplicated, essential hypertension as compared to normal subjects. To this aim, the response of blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac work to a multi-stage exercise test was investigated by analyzing the results of linear regression fitting of cardiovascular parameters (ie, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product (RPP)) versus time of exercise. Compared to normal patients, both essential and borderline hypertensive patients had a shorter average duration of exercise test (ie, a decreased exercise capacity), always negative for transient myocardial ischemia. This was in spite of a mild increment of maximal RPP (+19% and +10% v normal patients, respectively). Reduction of exercise duration in borderline and established hypertensive patients was related to the higher RPP at rest (+26% and +56% related to normal patients, respectively) and to the steeper slopes (rates of increment) of heart rate systolic pressure and RPP during exercise. Interestingly, in the overall population of normal and hypertensive subjects, the slopes of heart rate and RPP were directly correlated with basal blood pressure. In conclusion, these data indicate a decreased exercise tolerance in both established and borderline hypertensive patients without documented myocardial ischemia. This abnormality, which appears to be due to a disproportional increment during exercise not only of systolic pressure but also of heart rate, could reflect abnormalities in the autonomic control of heart function.\r"

Salt-sensitive compared with salt-insensitive subjects on high v low dietary salt intake had lower Ca++i0 (P less than .05), higher 1,25-D (P less than .02), and a greater hypertensive responsive to verapamil (% delta DBP = 17.7 v -8.2, P less than .05). The % delta DBP was related to the initial CT (r = 0.68, P less than .05), initial 1,25-D (R = -0.89, P less than .01), and to the drug-induced % delta 1,25 D (R = .60, P less than .05). Thus, lower initial calcium and calcitonin levels, higher initial levels of 1,25-D, and a greater drug-induced suppression of 1,25-D were associated with an enhanced hypotensive response to verapamil. Verapamil elevated Ca++i0 (2.46 +/- 0.04 to 2.53 +/- 0.04 2.00 mEq/L, P less than .05), and suppressed Mg (2.00 +/- 0.03 to 1.84 +/- 0.03 mEq/L, P less than .01) and 1,25-D levels (66.7 +/- 8.1 to 51.6 +/- 5.7 pg/mL, P less than .05). These results suggest interactive effects of sodium and calcium metabolism in essential hypertension, especially among salt-sensitive individuals. We conclude that alterations of calcium metabolism may underlie the sensitivity to verapamil therapy and may contribute to its hypotensive effects.\r"

Overall, 54% of all the patients undergoing laryngopharyngoesophagectomy had esophageal disease. This incidence of reflux and secondary esophageal malignant neoplasia is higher than in the general population. Careful assessment of the patient's preoperative history for gastroesophageal reflux, contrast swallowing studies, and esophagoscopies correctly diagnosed most but not all of the esophageal lesions found on pathologic examination. Interestingly, all of the esophageal carcinomas removed in the laryngopharyngoesophagectomy specimens were small and sometimes not evident clinically. Although gastroesophageal reflux has been postulated as an additional etiologic agent in the development of laryngeal carcinoma, all the patients in our study had heavy alcohol and tobacco consumption, and therefore reflux could not be evaluated separately as a risk factor.\r"

The indications for treatment were (1) aggressive primary or recurrent cancer; (2) disease fixed to deep muscle, carotid, or bone; or (3) close margins in an effort to preserve vital structures or function. The IORT was effective in preventing local recurrence in 14 (40%) of 35 patients with 2-year follow-up of squamous cell carcinoma. The complication rate was acceptable. Intraoperative radiotherapy appears to be a safe and beneficial adjunctive therapy for cancers that historically have extremely dismal prognoses.\r"

If after careful search the primary tumor remains truly occult, traditional methods of radiotherapy encompassing fields from the base of skull to clavicles are often employed, with significant attendant morbidity. To determine if more limited therapy would be effective in cases of isolated regional lymph node metastases, the patterns of tumor spread to nodes in the submandibular region were studied. A retrospective analysis of 472 radical neck specimens obtained from 1975 to 1985 revealed 19 cases (4.0%) of cervical metastases limited to the submandibular triangle. Sources of these tumors included lip (3), buccal mucosa (4), nasal vestibule (1), floor of mouth (4), alveolar ridge (3), oral tongue (1), and unknown (3). It appears that solitary submandibular nodal metastases predominantly arise from sites in the oral or nasal cavity. This suggests that in patients with isolated submandibular lymph node metastases from occult primary sites, a more conservative therapeutic approach to potential primary sites is indicated after treatment of the metastatic focus.\r"

Mice were immunized either (1) by repeated intraperitoneal injections, (2) by a single intrasplenic injection, or (3) by an intraperitoneal injection followed by an intrasplenic booster. Whereas a single intrasplenic immunization resulted in low-affinity antibodies to tumor-associated antigen, high-affinity antibodies were generated with the other two protocols, although at a lower frequency. No benefit was seen from tolerance induction. The intraperitoneal/intrasplenic protocol was found to be superior over the other protocols because of minimal antigen dose and immunization time, as well as a higher frequency of hybridoma formation.\r"

Conventional planar scintigraphy is limited by a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structures. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique in which a gamma camera rotates around the patient, acquires multiple projections, and with the aid of a computer, reconstructs three-dimensional representations. We wished to evaluate the potential advantages of SPECT in the assessment of mandibular graft viability and to compare it with planar scanning. These noninvasive methods of assessing the vascular supply are critical to patient management in the early postoperative period because the presence of or inability to exclude vascular compromise commands surgical exploration of the anastomosis for graft salvage. Fifteen patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with revascularized free grafts were studied by both planar and SPECT scintigraphy. Long-term follow-up data were correlated with the outcome predicted by the scanning.\r"

Five of the patients demonstrated an electrically evoked middle latency response. These data are comparable with behavioral and electrophysiologic responses from ears deafened by other causes and now successfully implanted. The results suggest that peripheral neural elements and central auditory pathways remain at least partially functional many years after a labyrinthectomy. Thus, a labyrinthectomy should not be withheld as a surgical option if otherwise indicated.\r"

No estrogen or progesterone receptors could be found in 18 consecutive acoustic neuromas from 7 men and 11 women, ranging in age from 26 to 73 years.

With the known increased rate of aggressive extranodal B-cell lymphomas in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, its existence in the nasopharynx should be ruled out histologically in symptomatic patients. Nasal obstruction and hearing loss secondary to nasopharyngeal lymphoid proliferation in high-risk patients can be an early sign of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Patients presenting with this clinical entity should be advised to have serologic testing and further treatment and counseling if necessary.\r"

Pseudotumor of infancy is a firm fibrous mass in the sternocleidomastoid muscle appearing at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Congenital muscular torticollis is less common and appears later in life. Pseudotumor and congenital muscular torticollis probably represent different manifestations of sternocleidomastoid muscle fibrosis. Pseudotumor will usually resolve with conservative therapy; however, some patients will subsequently develop torticollis. Congenital muscular torticollis usually requires surgical release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to achieve a good cosmetic result and to prevent plagiocephaly, facial asymmetry, and scoliosis. This report provides guidelines for the management of congenital muscular torticollis and pseudotumor of infancy based on the authors' experience and review of the medical literature. Representative case histories from the neonate through the adult are presented, and the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are discussed.\r"

Virus was produced by transfection of permissive cells with parental and recombinant clones, and the biologic and molecular properties of these viruses were compared. Virus derived from pHXB2gpt infected phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4+ leukemic T cell lines equally well. In contrast, virus derived from pHX-JY1 was transmitted slowly to both PBMC and cell lines, and the infectivity of pHX-JY1 virus was two orders of magnitude greater for PBMC than for T cell lines. All essential viral genes in the exchanged JY1 vif-env region were intact and functioned comparably to those of the parent clone in transfected COS-1 cells. The findings suggest differences in these regions of the HIV-1 genome may play an important role in differential cell tropism.\r"

This virus showed approximately 85% homology in overall nucleotide sequence with HIV-2ROD. The amino acid sequence of the gag and pol proteins of HIV-2[GH-1] showed 90% homology with those of HIV-2ROD, but its env gene and central regions were highly variable (more than 20% divergence in amino acids), indicating the presence of extensive genetic heterogeneity in HIV-2.

ADCC-mediating antibodies against target cells infected with the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1 were less frequently present in CSF than in sera, 32 and 60%, respectively. The frequency of ADCC-positive CSF was comparable for the different clinical stages of the disease and was apparently not influenced by the presence or absence of neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. Virus-neutralizing activity was tested against HTLV-IIIB and one CSF-derived viral isolate. Serum antibodies neutralized HTLV-IIIB more frequently than the CSF isolate, 53 and 35%, respectively. In contrast, only three (7%) of the CSF specimens contained neutralizing activity to the CSF-derived isolate and none to HTLV-IIIB. Despite an intact blood-brain barrier in many subjects, the serum/CSF ratios of ADCC or neutralizing antibodies were lower than normally expected. This indicates that both ADCC-mediating and virus neutralizing antibodies may be intrathecally synthesized. Whether these antibodies are protective against or contribute to the histopathologic changes in the brain is not known at present.\r"

No significant antiviral effects of PANS were demonstrated in chronically infected cells. The effect of PANS was demonstrated at an early step in HIV-1 replication, most likely reverse transcription. 3'-Aminonucleoside analogs are a novel class of inhibitors of HIV-1 replication that require further analysis in cell culture and animal studies.\r"

The bioreaction and bioactive products, as represented by neutrophil reaction and activated complement fragments generated during the use of a blood-perfused artificial organ, were studied as a model. Hemoperfusion with activated charcoal (AC) was used to remove the activated complement fragments. The adsorption of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) was evaluated following plasma perfusion through AC in vitro, all three of which were satisfactorily adsorbed. Six kinds of AC (three HEMA coated AC, two uncoated AC, and one cellulose coated AC) were compared with respect to adsorption of C5a in vitro. Uncoated AC adsorbed well and rapidly, but the coating with HEMA made adsorption take place slowly. The cellulose coating activated complement and did not decrease plasma C5a levels. After the adsorption of anaphylatoxins was confirmed, each of the AC columns was placed on-line after a cuprophan dialyzer in five chronic hemodialysis patients. C3a levels and neutrophil counts were compared with those obtained during usual hemodialysis (HD). By using heparin treated, uncoated AC, elevation of C3a levels and transient neutropenia were suppressed. Peak C3a with AC was reduced by 150% compared with prevalues, and the neutropenia nadir increased from 20% to 40% of baseline. The adsorption ability influenced the reduction in neutropenia. The heparinized uncoated AC and the column with large volumes of HEMA-coated AC had the best effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Comparing these values with the data compiled recently by three different groups of investigators in undialyzed patients with severe chronic renal failure indicates that the AG of the dialyzed patients was similar to that of untreated patients, but the HCO3 levels of dialyzed patients averaged 2 to 3 mEq/L higher. Separate prospective evaluation of the acute effect of two consecutive bicarbonate dialyses in 31 patients revealed that the average acute (immediate postdialysis) decrease (from predialysis values) in AG was only about 40% of that of the increase in HCO3. The authors conclude that bicarbonate dialysis is more effective in improving serum HCO3 than AG.\r"

The authors measured LAL-RM and complement C3a levels predialysis and at 15 and 60 minutes of dialysis in 16 patients dialyzed for 8 weeks on cuprophan membranes and then for a succeeding 8 weeks on cellulose acetate membranes. Patients' symptoms on dialysis with each membrane were assessed. The LAL-RM levels of these patients were compared to those of six patients dialyzed on cellulose acetate membranes only. The LAL-RM and C3a levels rose significantly in the 16 patients while on dialysis with cuprophan membranes, but there was no correlation between the LAL-RM and C3a levels. C3a levels rose significantly in the 16 patients while on dialysis with cellulose acetate membranes, but there was no rise in LAL-RM levels. C3a levels were significantly lower while the patients were on dialysis with the cellulose acetate membranes. The six patients on dialysis with the cellulose acetate membranes only had no detectable LAL-RM in their blood. Patients' symptoms were less while on dialysis with the cellulose acetate membrane, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance. We conclude that LAL-RM plays a very minor role, if any, in the complement activation caused by cuprophan membranes and that cellulose acetate membranes do not release LAL-RM.\r"

Mean age at repair was 26.6 years (range, 1-74). Pediatric patients requiring valved extracardiac conduits were excluded from the study. Previous procedures had been done in 14 of the 40 patients (35%). There were three hospital deaths (7.5%), and two late deaths (5.4%), with an actuarial survival of 87 +/- 5.5% at 37 months after repair. Four patients required re-entry for bleeding (10%), but in no patient was bleeding related to leakage through the patch. There were no episodes of hemolysis. Mediastinitis occurred in one patient (2.7%) and resolved with usual treatment. There were no late reoperations, with actuarial freedom from reoperation 100% at 37 months after repair. The authors conclude that surgical implantation of collagen impregnated Dacron provides good early phase results. The collagen treated knitted Dacron has excellent handling characteristics and is impermeable. However, because of concerns regarding the potential for thick intimal peel formation due to variable collagen resorption rates, the authors continue to recommend pulmonary homografts when a valved extracardiac conduit is required in children.\r"

Information was obtained on the following diseases and practices: 1) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients and staff members; 2) infection control procedures for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients; 3) frequency of HBsAg serologic screening; 4) use of hepatitis B vaccine; 5) non-A, non-B hepatitis in patients and staff members; 6) pyrogenic reactions and septicemia; 7) dialysis dementia; 8) new dialyzer syndrome; 9) high flux dialysis; 10) reuse of dialyzers, dialyzer caps, bloodlines, transducer filters; 11) cleaning and disinfection procedures; and 12) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 91%. These 1,486 centers represented 97,225 patients and 27,123 staff members. During the last 12 years, the incidence of HBV infection decreased from 3.0% to 0.2% among patients and from 2.6% to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of HBsAg-positivity declined from 7.8% to 1.7% among patients and from 0.9% to 0.4% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 88% of the centers. By the end of 1987, 14% of susceptible patients and 49% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1987, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12% to 18% among patients and from 18% to 50% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1987 was reported to be 1.2% among patients and 0.2% among staff members. Fourteen percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions among their patients, and 46% reported septicemia in the absence of pyrogenic reactions. Pyrogenic reactions were significantly more likely to be reported by centers that practiced high flux dialysis. The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 29%. Among patients developing dialysis dementia, the case fatality rate was higher in those centers that used deionization (DI) without reverse osmosis (RO) (47%) compared with centers that used RO (28%) (not significant, p greater than 0.05). In 1987, 64% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers. These centers treated 70% of the dialysis patient population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated vascular responses after cutaneous application of EMLA cream (a eutectic mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine) by skin reflectance spectroscopy and laser Doppler blood flowmetry. In healthy subjects, EMLA cream produced a biphasic vascular response with an initial vasoconstriction, maximal after 1.5 h of application. After prolonged application (greater than 3 h, vasodilatation occurred, presumably because of a smooth muscle relaxant effect of the analgesics. Vasoconstriction was also observed initially with two non-EMLA creams applied under occlusion, whereas the occlusive plastic film alone did not alter the vascular state. Thus late vasodilatation was unique to EMLA cream.\r"

The elimination half-life (T1/2 beta) of atracurium was significantly longer in the elderly group (23.1 v. 20.1 min), but there was no significant difference between the two groups in clearance (Cl), the volume of distribution (V beta) or the mean residence time (MRT) of atracurium. Laudanosine T1/2 beta was also significantly longer (229.1 v. 173.1 min) and the clearance significantly slower (4.85 v. 7.29 ml min-1 kg-1) in the elderly. There was, however, no significant difference in V beta for laudanosine between the two groups. These data suggest that atracurium depends to a small extent on the liver or the kidney for its metabolism and excretion, and that, as these routes of excretion are less efficient in the elderly, T1/2 beta is prolonged in this age group. The deteriorating function of these organs with increasing age may also explain the altered pharmacokinetics of laudanosine.\r"

The patients were allocated to four groups based on the type of surgery and dose of doxacurium (0.05 or 0.08 mg kg-1). No changes in left or right ventricular dimensions or contractility were detected in any group. Although significant changes (P less than 0.05) occurred in several groups, all these changes were clinically insignificant (less than 10% change from baseline values), and were similar to those seen in unstimulated anaesthetized patients.

In nine rabbits (group I) baseline ventilator settings were maintained constant throughout the study and airway pressure was readjusted to achieve a constant tidal volume. In the other nine rabbits (group II), ventilation was reinstituted after lung lavage with one period of four sustained inflations followed immediately by high frequency ventilation. In group I there was a significant decrease in gas exchange for oxygen and deterioration in pulmonary mechanics, whereas in group II there was little change in baseline blood-gas values or pulmonary mechanics. These data suggest that, with adequate ventilatory management during the period of lung lavage, the lung damage produced by this manoeuvre may be obviated.\r"

In such a system, wall friction is a major source of loss in jet momentum flux, in contrast with the changes in axis-symmetrical systems. This process results in a potentially beneficial increase in airway pressure and in greater mixing, which might be clinically useful.\r"

We measured impedance (0.125-32 Hz) in six dogs, and in four dogs after infusion of histamine. We interpreted Zrs data in terms of a linear resistance-inertance-elastance (R-I-E) model to estimate the pressure decrease in the airways and the pressure amplitude in the alveolar region. We modelled airways non-linearities and analysed their effect at high flow oscillation amplitudes.

  ".W": "The usefulness of measuring respiratory flow in the airway and at the chest wall and of measuring respiratory input impedance (Z) to monitor high frequency ventilation was investigated by computer simulation using a monoalveolar 10-coefficient model. The latter included a central airway with its resistance (Rc) and inertance (lc), a resistive peripheral airway (Rp), a lumped bronchial compliance (Cb), alveolar gas compliance (Cgas), lung tissue with its resistance (RL) and compliance (CL), and chest wall resistance (RW), inertance (lw) and compliance (Cw). Gas flow in the peripheral airway (Vp), shunt flow through Cb (Vb), gas compression flow (Vgas) and rate of volume change of the lung (VL) and of the chest (VW) were computed and expressed as a function of gas flow in the central airway (Vc). For normal values of the coefficients, Vp/Vc was found to decrease moderately with increasing frequency and was still 0.75 at 20 Hz. Peripheral airway obstruction (Rp x 5) considerably decreased Vp/Vc, particularly at high frequency. It did not change the relationship between the two measurable flows, Vc and Vw, but increased the effective resistance at low frequency and shifted the reactance curve to the right. A reduced lung or chest wall compliance produced little change in Vp/Vc and Z except at very low frequencies; however, it decreased the phase lag between Vw and Vc. Finally, an increased airway wall compliance decreased Vp/Vc, but had little effect on Z and Vw/Vc. It is concluded that measuring respiratory impedance may help in detecting some, but not all of the conditions in which peripheral flow convection is decreased during high frequency oscillations.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiogenic mixing was studied in seven anaesthetized closed-chest dogs undergoing mechanical ventilation by comparing single-breath washout of two poorly soluble inert gases of widely differing diffusivities (helium (He) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) in normal conditions with the heart beating (control), and during reversible temporary myocardial arrest (heart arrest). Cardiac arrest of approximately 20 s duration was induced repeatedly (8-15 times) by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine (approximately 35 mg) facilitated by a non-occluding 7-French gauge angiographic catheter maintained in the left coronary artery. After equilibration of lung gas with 1% helium and 1% SF6, single breath, constant flow expirograms were recorded in the tracheal tube by mass spectrometry after inspiration of test gas-free air. Series deadspace (VD) and relative alveolar slope (S) (increment of expired partial pressure, normalized to mixed expired-inspired partial pressure difference per increment of expired volume (S = (delta P/(PE-P1]/delta VE litre-1], were determined as indices for intrapulmonary gas mixing. The effects attributable to the action of the heart were quantified by the heart arrest: control ratio of VD and S, which were not significantly different from unity (P greater than 0.05) (VD: 0.95 (SD 0.05) for helium and 0.94 (0.07) for SF6; S:1.03 (0.10) for helium and 1.05 (0.14) for SF6. The He:SF6 ratios of VD and S (0.90 and 0.64, respectively), indicating diffusion dependent separation of gases, also were unaffected by the mechanical action of the heart. The data indicate that convective mixing by the mechanical action of the heart did not significantly enhance intrapulmonary mixing and transport.\r"

The weal and flare responses were evaluated after 3, 5 and 15 min and the areas calculated using an automatic image analyser. With the three different concentrations used (1, 3 and 30 pmols) a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in both the weal and flare response to SP, NKA, NT and histamine and a reduced flare to CGRP was observed only in AD patients. Among those with AD there was no uniformity of response to the individual neuropeptide and in general the more severely affected showed a lower reactivity. Dose-response relationships were evaluated for SP and NT (10-320 pmols) in AD and healthy controls. In AD dose-response curves and time-course relationships were similar to controls, but at significantly reduced levels. The itch response to the neuropeptides and histamine was not different in atopics and controls. We suggest that this hyporesponsiveness in AD is the result of natural tachyphylaxis of the target structures (mast cells and blood vessels) and possibly due to a higher availability of neuropeptides in the skin or to a primary abnormal sensitivity of the blood vessels and mast cells to these peptides.\r"

Injection of IL-1 beta per se resulted in erythema of the ears, and thus, IL-1 beta has the capacity not only to induce and augment but also to suppress inflammatory responses. Indomethacin administered as subcutaneously-implanted pellets did not influence the IL-1 beta induced-ear erythema, but suppressed to some extent the effect of IL-1 beta on the AA-induced ear oedema.\r"

In SLE, linear deposition of an immunoreactant at the BMZ was detected in 32% (6/19) of skin biopsies; 21% (4/19) of lip mucosal biopsies and 42% (5/12) of conjunctival biopsies. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the test at different sites in SLE and no correlation between a positive test in skin, lip or conjunctiva and clinical mucosal involvement. In CCLE, linear deposition of an immunoreactant at the BMZ was found in 3% (1/32) of skin biopsies; 3% (1/29) of lip mucosal biopsies and 50% (10/20) of conjunctiva and clinical mucosal involvement. In the conjunctiva, IgG was present in all but one of the biopsies and was the only immunoreactant in 90% (9/10) of positive CCLE biopsies and 60% (3/5) of positive SLE biopsies. In lupus erythematosus immunoreactants may be deposited in the basement membrane zone beneath non-keratinizing mucosal surfaces of the lip and the eye as well as the skin. In CCLE, the test may be positive in conjunctiva when skin and lip are negative.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro model has been developed to study the effect of soluble bacterial products on the viability and detachment of skin cell types utilized cultured grafts. Microbial products prepared from clinical isolates of bacterial species which most commonly colonize burn lesions showed marked variation in their ability to detach and kill both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. All three isolates of Acinetobacter spp. tested were effective in causing detachment and death of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, whereas Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. tested had little, or no, effect on detachment or viability for either skin cell type. Four Staphylococcus aureus isolates elicited variable strain-dependent results with regard to detachment and viability. One isolate possessed activity specific for keratinocyte detachment and death. These results indicate the possible undesirable effects such bacterial species may have on graft success in colonized burn wounds.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effect on sensitization of altering the area of application of 2,4,dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) at a constant dose per unit area. We showed that, when an area of less than 1 cm2 is used, this area is critical in determining the degree of sensitization. This contrasts with previous work that showed, for larger areas, an alteration in the area of application had little effect on sensitization, whereas keeping the area constant and increasing the concentration of DNCB increased the degree of sensitization. We suggest that not only is the amount of antigen important in determining response, but also the distribution of the antigen as presented to the afferent limb of the immune system.\r"

  ".W": "Recovery from epidermal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection depends primarily on development of an effective cell-mediated immune response, possibly generated following antigen (Ag) presentation by epidermal cells (EC). The ability of EC to present HSV Ag was investigated in 12 subjects with occasional recrudescent facial HSV infections. All had circulating HSV specific antibodies and cell-mediated immunity to the virus. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell suspensions, depleted of antigen presenting cells (APC) by glass adherence and then enriched for T cells by adsorption on nylon wool columns, did not proliferate in response to HSV Ag. Both EC suspensions, prepared from suction blister roofs, and glass-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (AC) preincubated with ultraviolet-inactivated HSV, reconstituted the T-cell proliferative response to HSV. EC were more efficient than AC at presenting HSV Ag to T cells. Depletion of CD1+ cells from EC suspensions by cell sorting reduced their ability to present HSV Ag and augmentation of CD1+ cell numbers supplemented it. Preincubation of EC or AC with monoclonal antibodies to major histocompatibility complex class II antigens DP, DQ or DR, blocked the lymphoproliferative response to HSV Ag. Evidence was obtained that cells co-ordinately expressing products of the DP, DQ and DR loci are involved in presentation of HSV Ag by both EC and AC.\r"

The purpose was to investigate the relative risk of developing CMM associated with different sun habits and indicators of pigmentation, such as skin type, eye colour and hair colour. Compared to people with black hair, blonde subjects had a relative risk of 74.4 (95% confidence interval, 45.8-120.8). Associations with skin type and eye colour were considerably weaker. Relative risks of about 1.5-2.5 were found for certain sun habits. The results suggest that in a population of Caucasian origin with a predominantly fair complexion, pigmentary status characterized by hair colour is a far more important aetiological factor than sun habits.\r"

The campaign resulted in a dramatic increase in workload and, at the pigmented lesion clinic, the numbers of new patients rose from 12.3 to 54.5 per clinic. There was a large rise in the number of new melanomas presenting in Leicestershire: from 1.02 per week before the campaign to 1.88 per week in the immediate post-publicity period. This was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). Although there was also an apparently encouraging rise in the percentage of thinner 'good prognosis' tumours, it was not possible to isolate this statistically from a pre-existing trend.\r"
