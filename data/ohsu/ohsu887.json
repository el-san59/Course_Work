The mortality rate significantly increased with age and was 3.5%, 11.5% and 12% in patients less than 65, 65 to 69 and 70 to 76 years of age, respectively (p less than 0.001). Logistic regression analyses selected female gender, diabetes mellitus, extensive coronary artery disease, history of congestive heart failure, continuing chest pain immediately after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administration, low systolic blood pressure at the time of admission and advanced age as variables predictive of in-hospital death. The incidence of major hemorrhagic events among patients not undergoing cardiac surgery during hospitalization was 8.7%, 14.5% and 24.7% in patients aged less than 65, 65 to 69 and greater than or equal to 70 years, respectively (p less than 0.001). The majority of hemorrhages were secondary to cardiac catheterization or puncture wounds. Variables related to a major hemorrhagic event included protocol, age, rt-PA dose/kg body weight and elevated diastolic blood pressure on admission. Of five intracranial bleeding events, three occurred in patients greater than 65 years. Transfusion requirements significantly increased with age (p less than 0.001). Reperfusion status at 90 min in the TIMI Phase I and open label studies A to C was similar in the three age groups studied and ranged from 60% to 71%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence rate ranged from 0.7% with lorcainide to 4.7% with propafenone. Congestive heart failure was present in 167 patients (41%) who underwent 491 drug trials. Congestive failure was induced in 15 (9%) of these 167 patients and involved 19 (3.9%) of the 491 tests. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 20 +/- 8% in patients who developed congestive failure, in contrast to 39 +/- 19% in those who did not (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that each of the six antiarrhythmic drugs examined has the potential to aggravate congestive heart failure in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or a history of congestive heart failure, but the incidence rate is low and its occurrence unpredictable.\r"

This study is based on the assumption that, in a patient with evolving acute myocardial infarction, hemostatic thrombi are likely to be older than the thrombus responsible for occlusion of the coronary artery. It explored whether the relative rates of lysis of fresh and old thrombi could be influenced by the rapidity of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administration. In each of 17 dogs, two 1 h and two 24 h old thrombi were produced by inserting copper coils into both jugular and both femoral veins. After 24 h and 1 h, respectively, the coils with the thrombi were removed, weighed and inserted into the adjacent carotid and femoral arteries. A 1 mg/kg body weight dose of rt-PA was given either over 180 or over 30 min. The coils were removed and weights of the residual thrombi determined at the end of the 180 min infusion (Group I), at the end of the 30 min infusion (Group IIA) and 45 min after the 30 min infusion (Group IIB). The 24 h old thrombi were lysed significantly less than the 1 h old thrombi in all three experimental groups: 53.9 +/- 4.8% (mean +/- SE) versus 86.1 +/- 2.5% in Group I (p less than 0.001), 16.6 +/- 3.5% versus 65.2 +/- 6.0% in Group IIA (p less than 0.001) and 21.6 +/- 5.4% versus 91.7 +/- 1.7% in Group IIB (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To improve further the patency rate of infarct-related coronary arteries, the following accelerated dosage regimen of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administered to 80 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than or equal to 6 h duration: 15 mg intravenous bolus, 50 mg infusion over 30 min and 35 mg infusion over the following 60 min. After coronary angiography at 90 min coronary angioplasty was performed in 16 patients and additional thrombolysis in 3 patients. Six patients were not included in the final angiographic analysis, mostly because of borderline ST segment elevations, in order to avoid overestimation of the efficacy of this dose regimen. Four of these had a patent infarct artery; no early angiogram was performed on two. Sixty minutes after the start of infusion, 54 (74%) of 73 patients had a patent infarct-related artery (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 2 or 3) as did 67 (91%) of 74 patients at 90 min. At 24 h, 61 (92.4%) of 66 patients showed a patent infarct artery. Recurrent myocardial ischemia was noted in 12 patients, 7 (9.4%) of whom experienced reinfarction during the hospital stay. Minor local bleeding complications were observed in 14 patients (17.5%). There were four in-hospital cardiac deaths; one patient who underwent additional thrombolysis for recurrent ischemia died from bleeding complications. These results show that a rapid infusion of 100 mg of rt-PA over 90 min yields a high early patency rate of the infarct-related artery without an increase in reocclusion rate and adverse reactions.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo and in vitro studies with a water-soluble extract of cotton bracts (CBE) suggest that CBE may be responsible for some of the clinical manifestations of byssinosis. Since chronic bronchitis has been repeatedly documented as a major feature of byssinosis, we studied the effect of CBE on respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC) release from human airways (HAs) in vitro. HAs were incubated with [3H]glucosamine to label RGC molecules. CBE in increasing concentrations was added to radiolabeled HAs, and the release of 3H-RGC, histamine, and other mediators was measured. CBE in concentrations of 1 to 7 mg/ml caused a dose-related increase in RGC, as well as histamine release (RGC, 14% to 45% increase above control; histamine, 12 to 70 ng/ml released concurrently). Additionally, CBE in a dose of 5 mg/ml caused a more than threefold increase in peptidoleukotriene production above baseline. The effect of histamine H1 and H2 (pyrilamine and cimetidine), cyclooxygenase pathway inhibitor (indomethacin), leukotriene (LY 171883 and FPL 55712), and lipoxygenase pathway (BW nordihydroguaiarectic acid) blocking agents on CBE-induced RCG secretion was studied. In addition to histamine-H1 blockers, lipoxygenase inhibitors (nordihydroguaiarectic acid and BW 755C) and leukotriene blockers (FPL 55712 and LY 171883) are also potent inhibitors of CBE-induced RGC secretion. This suggests that CBE may act via the release of several mediators (histamine and leukotrienes), possibly from airway cells, such as mast cells, macrophages, or epithelial cells, to stimulate RGC secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a naturally occurring phospholipid that acts as a potent mediator of inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Since mucus secretion accompanies many pulmonary-allergic reactions, we examined the effect of PAF on respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC) release from human airways in vitro. PAF, in concentrations of 5 to 100 ng/ml, induced a specific, dose-dependent release of [3H]RGC from human airways in vitro (range of 15% to 120% increase above control, p less than 0.001; n = 8). Time-course studies revealed that RGC release reached its peak level by 60 minutes, and by the end of 4 hours, decreased almost to the baseline level, suggesting a stimulatory effect on secretion rather than synthesis. PAF analog, RO 19-3704, which is a PAF-receptor antagonist, inhibited RGC secretion mediated by PAF in a dose-dependent manner with an inhibitory concentration of 50% of 70 ng/ml. BW 755C and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, but not indomethacin, inhibited RGC release by PAF. LY 171883, a specific leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist, totally inhibited the release of RGC by PAF. Similar results were observed with FPL 55712. PAF-treated airways generated peptidoleukotrienes significantly above control airways in association with enhanced RGC secretion. This enhanced effect on RGC secretion was specifically and significantly blocked by LY 171883. Atropine (10(-5) mol/L) augmented the secretagogue activity of PAF, whereas dexamethasone (10(-5) mol/L) inhibited it. These data indicate that PAF is a significant RGC secretagogue that affects the RGC-secreting cells via the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and the generation of leukotrienes in the airways, but not through the cholinergic receptors on the secretory cells.\r"

At the end point evaluation, mean total scores of combined nasal and nonnasal symptoms decreased from baseline (improved) 46%, 44%, and 35%, respectively, for loratadine, terfenadine, and placebo. The difference between loratadine and placebo treatment was significant (p = 0.03). Loratadine was particularly effective compared with placebo in relieving nasal discharge, sneezing, and itching/burning eyes. Therapeutic response to treatment was good or excellent in 66 (64%) of 103 loratadine-treated patients, 58 (56%) of 104 terfenadine-treated patients, and 48 (47%) of 102 placebo-treated patients. Adverse experiences reported during the study were usually mild or moderate and were not significantly different among the three treatment groups. Sedation (somnolence) was reported by 10 loratadine-treated patients, seven terfenadine-treated patients, and eight placebo-treated patients.

Objectives for this research included determination of parameters of operating costs in conventional, cook-chill, and cook-freeze systems and comparison of costs for the three foodservice systems. Operational and financial data were collected for 33 conventional, 22 cook-chill, and 11 cook-freeze hospital foodservice systems. Results indicated little difference among the three systems for most operational and financial variables, suggesting that, in general, managers of conventional, cook-chill, and cook-freeze systems are employing similar resources to achieve their objectives. The number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) was found to be the strongest predictor of operating costs in all three systems. Data suggest that installation of a ready-food system may not lead to savings in costs.\r"

The pharmacological treatment of eating disorders is based upon theoretical principles. The theoretical models include: (a) an illness secondary to other psychiatric disorders, (b) a disorder in the hypothalamic control of food intake, (c) a disorder of hypothalamic endocrine regulation, (d) a syndrome secondary to depressive illness, and (e) a disorder in the hypothalamic regulation of food intake. Theoretical models a, b, and c govern the choice of drug therapy for anorexia nervosa, and models d and e govern the choice of drug therapy for bulimia. Drugs used to treat anorexia nervosa and bulimia include tricyclic antidepressants and lithium carbonate. Chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, cyproheptadine, and clomiphene citrate have also been prescribed for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat bulimia. Fenfluramine has the potential to be of therapeutic value in patients with bulimia. Although drug therapy plays a limited role in the treatment of eating disorders, drugs are commonly prescribed. Therefore, the nutritionist should be familiar with the basic pharmacology and the side effects related to drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The finding of a large number of recurrent fragile sites on human chromosomes provides suggestive evidence for the origin of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements that are a common feature in most neoplasias. These fragile sites can be induced by a wide variety of mutagens and carcinogens that are known to act through different molecular mechanisms. They correlate with two-thirds of the recurrent cancer chromosomal breakpoints known thus far and with the location of most mapped oncogenes and growth factors. Because we have now found that a large number of fragile sites can also be induced by agents such as DNase I and benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE), which are known to induce hypersensitive chromatin sites, it is possible that a class of fragile sites represents regulatory regions of active genes. We have also introduced restriction enzymes into cultured lymphocytes and found that fragile sites are expressed in a pattern similar to that produced by DNase I and BPDE. Because fragile sites have a higher expression with advancing age, cigarette smoking, and deficiency of folic acid and B12 vitamins, they may represent active genomic sites that are vulnerable to physiological and environmental disturbance.\r"

  ".W": "The elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) requires an early-acting Thy-1+ cell that produces an Ag-specific, non-MHC-restricted factor that initiates DTH by sensitizing the local tissue for release of the vasoactive amine serotonin. We characterized the phenotype of this DTH-initiating cell by treating cells from sensitized mice with different antibodies and then either with rabbit C or anti-Ig panning or bead separation to deplete various subpopulations. We then transferred these cells i.v. into naive recipients that were challenged to elicit DTH. Our findings indicate that the early DTH-initiating cell is Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, CD4-, CD8- and CD3-, whereas the classical, late DTH effector T cell is Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, CD4+, CD8-, and CD3+. We hypothesize that DTH-initiating cells are primitive T cells with Ag receptors that can bind Ag without MHC-restriction. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that two different antibodies, that both bind T cell-derived Ag-binding molecules, eliminated the DTH-initiating, cell but did not affect the late component, MHC-restricted CD4+, CD3+ T cell. Additional experiments with antibodies against restricted determinants of the T-200 glycoprotein family (CD45R) showed that the early but not the late cell is positive for B220, which is usually present on B cells, and on some activated T cells. Also, the DTH-initiating cell is Il-2R-, but Il-3R+; whereas the late component DTH T cell is IL-2R+ and IL-3-. Our findings suggest that DTH-initiating cells may be Ag-specific lymphoid precursor cells that arise before final differentiation along the pathway leading to mature T or B cells. Our results indicate that antigen-specific Thy-1+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8- cells function in vivo to initiate DTH reactions.\r"

T-depleted C57BL/6 spleen cells incubated with TSST-1 for 3 h at 0 degree C were mitogenic to splenic T cells, indicating that the former cells bind and present TSST-1 to T cells. TSST-1-binding activity was observed in C57BL/6 splenic B cells and L cells transfected with I-Ab genes, but not in splenic T cells and control L cells. Scatchard plot analysis showed that these B cells and transfectants bound TSST-1 with similar binding affinity. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that lysates of C57BL/6 spleen cells and the I-Ab-positive transfectants contain a single band which bound TSST-1 and comigrated with I-Ab heterodimers. TSST-1-binding activity observed clearly in C57BL/6. BALB/c, and C3H/HeN spleen cells and L cells transfected with I-Ab or I-Ak genes was not reduced by paraformaldehyde fixation. Binding of 125I-TSST-1 to the three spleen cells was markedly reduced by anti-I-A antibodies, but not by anti-I-E antibodies. C57BL/6, C3H/HeN, and (C3H/HeN x C57BL/6) F1 T cells were activated by TSST-1 to proliferate and produce IL-2 in the presence of FT6.2 cells, LT1-30-3 cells and either of them, respectively, but not in the presence of control L cells. These results indicate that I-A molecules function as the structures via that accessory cells directly bind TSST-1 on the cell surface and present a triggering signal of TSST-1 to T cells.\r"

We have designated these subsets CD16neg, CD16dim, and CD16bright according to the relative surface density of CD16. The CD16bright subset comprised about 10% to 15% of PBL, whereas the CD16dim and CD16neg subsets comprise less than 1% of the total lymphocytes. A detailed characterization of these subsets revealed both similarities and differences. The three subsets shared a great deal of phenotypic similarity, expressing CD2, CD7, CD11b, CD38, CD45R, CD18, and the p75 IL-2R on the majority of the cells in each subset. There were, however, several prominent phenotypic differences, particularly in the expression of CD57, CD11c, CD44, CD25, Leu-8, L263, and L265. The CD16neg cells were morphologically large agranular lymphocytes and demonstrated low levels of non-MHC restricted cytolysis of NK-sensitive tumor lines. The CD16dim and CD16bright subsets were large granular lymphocytes and revealed potent cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive targets. All subsets demonstrated IL-2-dependent activation and proliferation; however, the CD16dim and CD16neg subsets were preferentially responsive to very low concentrations of rIL-2. Although rIL-4 effectively inhibited the IL-2-induced cytolytic activation of all three NK cell subsets, only the CD16bright cells showed rIL-4 inhibition of IL-2 dependent proliferation. Cytokine transcription was also differentially regulated in the NK cell subsets after rIL-2 activation. Although TNF-alpha was equally transcribed in each subsets, IFN-gamma and serine protease-HF were preferentially transcribed in the CD16bright NK cells. Based on these results, we propose that these NK cell subsets represent portions of the NK cell differentiation pathway present in the peripheral blood.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the high affinity receptor for IFN-gamma of Raji cells and human placenta by combining Scatchard analysis, cross-linking experiments, and receptor purification. Only one high affinity binding site was found, Kd 2.1 X 10(-10). The receptor is a 90-kDa glycoprotein. However, multiple cross-linked products of 110 kDa to about 250 kDa could be generated and proteins of 90, 70, and 50 kDa could be obtained upon purification. These proteins all contained the same 90-kDa receptor, or part of it. We suggest that extensive cross-linking and/or proteolysis may explain many of the conflicting results published thus far. The extracellular domain of the 90-kDa receptor protein was highly resistant to digestion with trypsin or proteinase K. Trypsin digestion neither affected the number of binding sites per cell, nor the Kd for IFN-gamma. A cluster of sites for different proteases was found in the intracellular domain. The 50-kDa fragment created by trypsin digestion had the same characteristics as the isolated 50-kDa receptor fragment. It contained the IFN-gamma binding site and the receptor's extracellular and amino-terminal domain. N-linked glycosylation contributed about 15 kDa to its molecular mass, of which 4 kDa were attributable to sialic acid residues. O-Linked glycosylation was not detected. The number of binding sites per cell and the Kd for IFN-gamma were not affected by the presence or absence of N-linked glycosylation. The receptor contained at least one critical disulfide bridge and the reduced receptor could be reactivated in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "In BALB/c mice infected i.v. with attenuated strain 19 of Brucella abortus, the organism replicates to high numbers in the spleen and reaches peak concentrations at 2 wk postinfection (p.i.). The infection is then progressively cleared so that by 8 wk p.i. numbers of bacteria have decreased 10,000 fold or more. Passive transfer assays were performed with T cell-enriched spleen cells and serum of donor mice infected 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 wk previously. Antibodies conferred significant protection to recipients at and after 3 wk p.i., whereas protection by T cells was not evident until 4 wk p.i. The combined transfer of serum and cells enhanced protection over that provided by serum or cells alone when transfers were made before, but not after, challenge infection. Protection conferred by T cell-enriched spleen cells of 6-wk donors was unaffected by the presence of equal quantities of cells from 3-wk donors, but was abrogated by the removal of both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. Experiments with purified CD4 and CD8 subsets revealed that cell-mediated protection resided at equivalent levels in both subsets. Daily treatment of mice with Cyclosporin A for 4 wk after infection caused some increase in numbers of brucellae in spleens and livers. Although immune responses of treated animals were markedly suppressed, there was little effect of treatment on numbers of macrophages in the spleen, on enhanced killing of Listeria monocytogenes in the spleen, or on the nature and intensity of splenic and hepatic inflammatory responses. These data indicate that acquired resistance to infection with B. abortus in mice is the result of independent, and probably also interactive, effects of antibodies and T effector cells of both CD4 and CD8 phenotypes. The initial decline in bacterial numbers in the spleen, which occurred in the absence of detectable cell-mediated immunity in that organ, could probably be ascribed principally to effects of antibodies and to nonimmune stimuli responsible for increased formation, attraction, and activation of macrophages.\r"

The sequences of hybridoma VH and VL were obtained and DNA rearrangements at both V region loci were studied to ascertain clonal relationships. In all three adoptive transfer experiments, each mouse of a pair receiving cells from the same donor contained hybridomas which were clonally related to each other. In two of these experiments paired recipients possessed cells that had identically mutated V genes. These results lead us to conclude that once a B cell clone(s) dominates a response, progeny of that clone form the memory cell population for many months. Moreover, stability appears to be generated in some memory B cells through inactivation of the hypermutation mechanism.\r"

CD3,8 BSMAB cause selective cytolysis of CD8+ lymphocytes by bridging the CD8 molecules of target lymphocytes to the CD3 molecular complex of cytolytic T lymphocytes with concurrent activation and proliferation of residual CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes. Similarly, CD3,4 BSMAB cause selective lysis of CD4+ lymphocytes whereas concurrently activating the residual CD3+CD8+ T cells. Small tumor fragments from four malignant melanoma and three renal cell carcinoma patients were cultured in medium containing CD3,8 + IL-2, CD3,4 + IL-2, or IL-2 alone. CD3,8 led to selective propagation of the CD4+ TIL whereas CD3,4 led to selective propagation of the CD8+ TIL from each of the tumors. The phenotypes of the TIL subset cultures were generally stable when assayed over a 1 to 3 months period and after further expansion with anti-CD3 mAb or lectins. Specific 51Cr release of labeled target cells that were bridged to the CD3 molecular complexes of TIL suggested that both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures have the capacity of mediating cytolysis via their Ti/CD3 TCR complexes. In addition, both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures from most patients caused substantial (greater than 20%) lysis of the NK-sensitive K562 cell line. The majority of CD4+ but not CD8+ TIL cultures also produced substantial lysis of the NK-resistant Daudi cell line. Lysis of the autologous tumor by the TIL subsets was assessed in two patients with malignant melanoma. The CD8+ TIL from one tumor demonstrated cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor but negligible lysis of allogeneic melanoma targets. In conclusion, immunocompetent CD4+ and CD8+ TIL subsets can be isolated and expanded directly from small tumor fragments of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma using BSMAB. The resultant TIL subsets can be further expanded for detailed studies or for adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

The T lymphoid line, L4, was cloned by growth in agar. L4 cells were initially negative for Thy-1.2 and CD4 (although they contained rearranged TCR-beta genes), and they remained so if passaged in medium alone. However, cocultivation of these Thy-1.2- CD4- cells with the cloned stromal cell line, St3, resulted in sequential expression of Thy-1.2 and CD4 in subpopulations of cells. Thy-1.2+ CD4- and Thy-1.2+ CD4+ L4 subclones were obtained from the cocultures by subsequent cloning in agar. Derivation of these subclones from the starting Thy-1.2- CD4- clone was verified by Southern blot analyses specific for TCR-beta gene rearrangements and for M-MuLV(myc) proviral integration sites. Continuous cocultivation of Thy-1.2+ CD4+ L4 subclones with the St3 stromal cells was necessary for maintenance of CD4 on the cell surface. Furthermore, CD4 expression which was lost when CD4+ L4 cells were removed from the stroma could be reinduced if they were again cultured on St3 stroma. These cells may provide a model system for studying thymocyte-stromal cell interactions in induction and maintenance of expression of Thy-1 and CD4 molecules.\r"

PBMC were activated in vitro with killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis and afterward tested for CTL activity on autologous target cells primed with 1) killed M. tuberculosis, 2) intact recombinant 65-kDa hsp of Mycobacterium bovis/M. tuberculosis; or 3) tryptic fragments of the recombinant 65-kDa hsp. Strong CTL activity was observed on targets primed with killed M. tuberculosis or with tryptic fragments of the 65-kDa hsp, but not on those primed with the intact 65-kDa hsp. M. tuberculosis activated T cells from 2/13 donors tested exerted killer activity against unprimed targets. To assess whether T cell responses were directed against self-epitopes shared by the mycobacterial and human 65-kDa hsp, four peptides of at least 10 amino acids length were synthesized corresponding to fully or almost identical regions of these molecules. Peripheral blood T cells from 8/9 individuals tested, after activation with killed M. tuberculosis, expressed strong CTL activity toward autologous targets primed with one or more of these synthetic peptides. By using HLA-DR transfected murine L cells we found that the epitopes were recognized in the context of histocompatible HLA-DR (class II) molecules. We conclude that the demonstration of T cells with specificity to self-epitopes in vitro is not indicative for autoimmune disease. However, if at certain stages of infection such T cells are activated by crossreactive microbial epitopes they could cause autoimmune responses.\r"

A CD8+ T lymphocyte population specifically activated against the EAE-inducing S1 cells can be readily isolated from the lymphoid organs of pretreated animals. We show, in the present study, that encephalitogenic T cell lines derived from Lewis rats differ in their ability to induce resistance against tEAE in vivo and to stimulate CD8+ cell proliferation in vitro. We also demonstrate that the S19 line of encephalitogenic T cells, in combination with myelin basic protein (MBP), can stimulate CD8+ cell proliferation in vitro. The CD8+ cells generated in this way strongly suppress MBP-specific T cell proliferation in vitro. This combined effect of T cells and MBP was also evident in vivo. Neither S19 cells nor MBP alone induced resistance against S19-mediated tEAE, rather coinjection of these cells and MBP was required. Our results suggest that resistance to EAE is mediated by distinct populations of encephalitogenic T cells that activate Ts cells through different mechanisms. In some instances, both autoreactive T cells and their relevant autoantigen(s) may be needed to activate Ts cells in vivo.\r"

Because IFN-gamma, one of the Th1-specific cytokines, has been reported to produce some of the manifestations of DTH, we have investigated the role of IFN-gamma in the DTH reaction induced by Th1 cells by using a mAb which neutralizes the biologic activity of IFN-gamma. Anti IFN-gamma inhibited up to 55% of the swelling response induced by seven Th1 clones in BALB/c and CBA/J mice suggesting that IFN-gamma is an important mediator of Th1-induced DTH. This inhibition was consistently observed during the peak phase of the DTH response and could be partly but not entirely explained by decreases in vascular leakage. The DTH responses induced by two Th1 clones in C57BL/6 mice were not inhibited by anti IFN-gamma. Taken together, these data suggest that other inflammatory mediators also play a role in Th1-induced DTH responses. Based on the gross description and kinetics of the response and the numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes in the cellular infiltrate, Th1-induced DTH appears to be similar to the Jones-Mote type of hypersensitivity.\r"

The production of Listeria-induced TNF coincides with the time when peak numbers of bacteria are present in the liver and spleen. Evidence suggesting that TNF produced in Listeria-infected organs functions in a T cell-independent resistance mechanism comes from results showing that listeriosis is exacerbated in both T cell-intact mice and T cell-deficient (athymic nude) mice treated with a monospecific anti-murine TNF IgG. Listeriosis is exacerbated, however, only if the anti-TNF IgG is given during the first 3 days of infection, i.e., at the time when TNF is being produced in the spleen. Anti-TNF IgG administered on the first day of infection neutralized all the cytotoxic activity of endogenously produced TNF in the spleen. Additional evidence that TNF plays an important role in antibacterial defenses was obtained by showing that administration of pure murine rTNF protects mice against a normally lethal Listeria challenge given 1 to 24 h later.\r"

  ".W": "IL-7 induced the proliferation of normal thymocytes and the effect was synergistically potentiated by a small dose of IL-2, which by itself hardly affected thymocyte proliferation. No synergism was observed between IL-7 and any one of the other lymphokines including IL-1, IL-3, and IL-4. The thymocyte culture stimulated with IL-7 and IL-2 consisted of single positive (CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+) and double negative (CD4-CD8-) populations, and double positive (CD4+CD8+) cells were completely deleted. Both single positive and double negative thymocytes expressed CD3, but only the former exhibited V beta 8 and V beta 6 in an expected proportion (approximately 30% in BALB/c mice) and the latter none at all. Immunoprecipitation of the cultured thymocytes by anti-TCR gamma antibody, on the other hand, revealed the presence of a TCR gamma chain. Taken together, these results indicated that the thymocyte cultured with IL-7 and IL-2 consisted of mature T cells bearing alpha beta or gamma delta TCR. Experiments using preselected thymocyte subpopulations indicated that double negative cells responded to both IL-7 and IL-2 with positive synergism when combined, while thymocytes enriched for single positive cells preferentially responded to IL-7 with little response to IL-2 and no detectable synergism. Double positive thymocytes showed no proliferation in response to IL-7 and IL-2. In contrast to single positive thymocytes, splenic T cells hardly responded to IL-7, although significant proliferation was induced in the presence of a low dose of IL-2. Thymocytes cultured with IL-7 and IL-2 showed little nonspecific cytotoxic activity, but responded to Con A or alloantigen, whereas those stimulated with a high dose of IL-2 alone exhibited potent cytotoxic activity. These results indicated that IL-7 was involved in the generation of immunocompetent T cells in the thymus in concert with IL-2.\r"

  ".U": "90038531\r", 
  ".W": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a flavin-dependent enzyme which uses superoxide anion as a cosubstrate to catalyze the decyclization of the pyrrole ring of L-tryptophan to form formylkynurenine. This enzyme is induced in some tumor cells after treatment with IFN-gamma. The mechanism of induction of IDO in tumor cells by IFN-gamma was studied in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Before the addition of IFN-gamma, no IDO could be detected in these cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells with IFN-gamma produced an induction of IDO, with peak activity occurring 72 to 96 h after addition of IFN-gamma. Because phorbol esters are known to induce many enzymes in cells, most likely through the activation of protein kinase C, the effects of PMA on the induction of IDO were determined. PMA potentiated the IFN-gamma-induced elevation of IDO, but by itself, was unable to induce enzyme activity. Maximum induction of IDO in the presence of PMA and IFN-gamma was obtained by preexposure of the cells to PMA for 48 h before the addition of IFN-gamma. Maximum induction of IDO after the addition of IFN-gamma occurred 24 to 48 h after addition of the cytokine to the culture medium. However, the induction of IDO does not appear to be potentiated through the activation of protein kinase C, because the addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 had no effect on the induction of IDO when the cells were exposed to PMA and IFN-gamma. Moreover, diacylglycerol was unable to replace PMA in these studies. Studies with cAMP and cGMP analogs suggest a role for these compounds in the regulation of IDO expression.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular localization of glutathione-requiring PGD synthetase, which catalyzes the predominant formation of PGD2 in various peripheral tissues, was investigated in adult rats by immunoperoxidase-staining with a polyclonal antibody specific for this enzyme. Although the 25 N-terminal amino acid residues of synthetase are 56% identical and 76% similar to those of several rat glutathione S-transferase subunits, the antibody cross-reacted only with synthetase in dot blotting and was nearly completely inactive with all transferase isozymes thus far purified. In Western blotting after SDS-PAGE of crude extracts of rat spleen, the antibody showed a single positive band at the same position as that of the purified enzyme (Mr = 26,000). The positive immunocytochemical stain was found in a number of histiocytes and/or dendritic cells in spleen, thymus, and Peyer's patch of intestine. The immunostain was also observed in such cells in lamina propria of the villus in small intestine and colon, in submucosal layer of stomach, and in Kupffer cells in liver. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that immunoreactivity of this enzyme was distributed in cytoplasm of those cells. Such immunoreactive cells were not observed in brain, spinal cord, kidney, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle. These observations suggest that PGD2 is produced by glutathione-requiring PGD synthetase localized in these types of APC in various tissues and may play a critical role in dictating the progression of immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "By using a series of overlapping synthetic peptides that cover more than 95% of the amino acid sequence of nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A/NT/60/68 virus, five Th cell epitopes in B10.S (H-2s), BALB/c (H-2d), CBA (H-2k), and B6 (H-2b) mice have been identified. The specificity of Th cell recognition of epitopes is largely dependent on the H-2 haplotype of the responding mouse strain. However, two out of the five Th epitopes defined could be recognized by mice of more than one haplotype, implying that the primary sequence of protein antigens could also influence the selection of dominant T cell epitopes by the immune system. Immunization of B10.S mice with peptide 260-283 generated strong Th cell response against type A influenza viruses. In the other three strains of mice tested, priming with helper peptides induced a stronger antipeptide than antiviral T cell response. However, the low responsiveness to virus in these mice could be partially overcome by immunization with a mixture of several helper peptides. The Th epitopes are defined by the ability of the peptides to stimulate class II MHC restricted CD4+ T cells to proliferate and to produce IL-2 in vitro. When compared with the known epitopes on NP recognised by class I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, it appears that Th and cytotoxic T cell epitopes are nonoverlapping. The AMPHI and Motifs methods were employed to analyze the sequence of NP and predict the potential dominant sites in the molecule. The predictions are compared with the experimental data obtained and the implications discussed.\r"

IL-4 was found to inhibit the IFN-gamma-dependent hydrogen peroxide production of monocytes. Treatment of monocytes with IFN-gamma (200 to 600 U/ml) for 48 h increased the hydrogen peroxide production fourfold above background. Coincubation of the monocytes with IL-4 (1 to 1000 U/ml) and IFN-gamma (200 to 600 U/ml) inhibited this increase by 50 to 100%. IL-4 alone did not modulate the hydrogen peroxide production of monocytes. Pretreatment of monocytes with IL-4 for 20 min to 3 h was already effective in preventing the IFN-gamma response. Addition of IL-4 not later than 6 h after the start of incubation with IFN-gamma was necessary for an optimal inhibitory effect. IL-4 also inhibited the IFN-gamma-induced antileishmanial capacity of monocytes: IFN-gamma (1000 U/ml) induced a 54 +/- 10% reduction in the number of parasites. Monocytes treated with combinations of IL-4 (100 to 1000 U/ml) and IFN-gamma (1000 U/ml) were unable to reduce the parasite numbers. IL-4 alone did not alter the uptake of Leishmania donovani nor induce antileishmanial activity. These results demonstrate that IL-4 disables human cultured monocytes to respond to IFN-gamma activation.\r"

The phenol-water extract from strain A7A1-28 was immunoreactive by immunoelectrophoresis against antisera to three additional strains of B. gingivalis, however, the PS was only reactive with homologous serum. Immunochemical characterization of decarboxylated and deacetylated PS derivatives suggest that the acetylation of the amino sugars, but not the presence of the carboxylate residue on galactosaminuronic acid contributes to major immunodeterminant expression.\r"

  ".W": "The C-terminal (3') amino acid repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum Ag Pf155/RESA, a vaccine candidate, contains immunodominant T and B cell epitopes. In order to identify additional T cell epitopes in the molecule, synthetic peptides corresponding to the centrally (5') located repeat region, as well as to four nonrepeated regions, were synthesized. T cells from 46 P. falciparum-primed individuals living in a holoendemic area of The Gambia where malaria transmission is seasonal were tested for their responsiveness to the peptides by thymidine incorporation and IFN-gamma release. There was a considerable variation in the response to different peptides. Proliferation and IFN-gamma release were not correlated in individual donors, underlining the importance of measuring both activities when screening donor populations for total T cell responsiveness to a given Ag. Whereas 72% of the donors responded with proliferation and/or IFN-gamma release to the intact protein the mean % responders to the peptides was 40%. The most frequent responses (up to 60%) were induced with peptides from the 3'- and 5'-repeat region of the protein. Analysis of some closely related sequences in the 3'-repeat region indicated that they contained at least two epitopes that were either distinct or cross-reacting in different donors, suggesting difference in the genetic control of these responses. When the same peptides were investigated for reactivity with antibodies, the best T cell inducing sequences also displayed the best antibody reactivities. However, in individual donors, T and B cell responses were not correlated. T cell responses were shown to persist after a period with no P. falciparum transmission, whereas antibody concentrations tended to decrease, suggesting differences in the requirements of boosting at the T and B cell levels, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of somatic mutation to the generation of an antibody response was investigated by using the phosphocholine (PC) determinant in the bacterium Proteus morganii as the model Ag. The response to this determinant is restricted to a single VH/VL pair and apparently is derived from only one or two precursors per mouse. In this study we examined hybridoma antibodies from nine individual mice which produced representatives of 12 different clones. We found that all antibodies reactive with the PC Ag of P. morganii contained somatic mutations; the number ranged from 2 to 20. Two clusters of mutations were observed, one in complementarity-determining residue (CDR) 2 and the other in CDR 3 of VH. Examination of a three-dimensional model of M603, an antibody with the same V region composition as the anti-PC antibodies under study, showed that these clusters occupied an area of the binding site which presumably interacts with carrier elements of the PC epitope in P. morganii. A high incidence of recurring mutations were found in both clusters, and one of these was invariant, leading to an Asn for Asp substitution at 95. Ag binding studies with these antibodies and an additional one, which was unmutated except for the invariant substitution at 95, showed that: 1) antibodies having only the 95Asn mutation failed to bind the PC Ag of P. morganii, 2) addition of a second recurring mutation, at 52a (CDR 2), was sufficient to create strong binding to the P. morganii Ag, and 3) accumulation of mutations was directly correlated with increased binding activity for Ag. These results show that somatic mutations play a critical, if not essential, role in generating specificity for this PC Ag, and that Ag, and most likely a carrier element of the epitope, is a primary force in the continued selection and expansion of Ag-reactive B cells.\r"

Since 1980, 12 outbreaks of CH have occurred in US zoos, involving several callitrichid species including the endangered golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia). CH was experimentally transmitted to common marmosets via a bacteria-free filtrate of liver from a naturally infected tamarin. All three inoculated marmosets developed an acute fatal disease with the characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings of CH. Human hepatotropic viruses that can infect the livers of callitrichids were not detected serologically in any of the experimentally infected marmosets. Enveloped viruslike particles 85-105 nm in diameter were observed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of hepatocytes from both naturally infected and experimentally inoculated animals. An immunoblot assay was developed using sera from tamarins exposed to natural outbreaks of CH and liver extracts from experimentally infected or control marmosets. A new CH-specific antigen was detected in the livers of naturally infected and experimentally inoculated marmosets but not controls. These results suggest that the etiologic agent of callitrichid hepatitis is a new primate hepatitis virus.\r"

The beneficial effect of AmB appears due to a delay in the replication of the scrapie agent in the brain of infected hamsters. Moreover, AmB suppresses scrapie replication in the spleen of treated animals. Three hypotheses may explain these results: (1) AmB alters a hypothetical scrapie receptor, preventing the entry of the agent into central nervous system (CNS) target cells; (2) AmB interferes with mechanisms involved in scrapie replication; (3) AmB prevents the formation and accumulation of a scrapie-specific amyloid protein responsible for the disease. Whatever the mechanism of action, AmB is the only currently available drug to modify experimental CNS scrapie infection, so AmB is proposed as a novel class of antiscrapie drugs.\r"

The lysis was prevented by scavengers of hypochlorous acid. When platelets were added to the cytolytic system, a dose-dependent inhibition of the lysis was observed. Moreover, platelets lowered the HOCl recovery from OPZ-triggered PMNs. A positive linear relationship was found between the extent of the lysis mediated by and the amount of HOCl recovered from PMNs. Finally, both the inhibition of the lysis and the reduction of the HOCl recovery induced by platelets were prevented by pulsing platelets with carmustine (BCNU) to block their glutathione cycle. These results suggest that platelets act by consuming via their glutathione cycle significant amounts of PMN-derived hydrogen peroxide, with a consequent impairment of the PMN HOCl production and, in turn, lytic efficiency. Consistent with such a conclusion, platelets were found to consume PMN-derived H2O2 via a BCNU-inhibitable process. Further, the platelet inhibitory activity could be abolished by the addition of an appropriate extra-flux of enzymatically generated H2O2. No evidence for a platelet-induced inhibition of OPZ-PMN interaction, PMN myeloperoxidase release, and H2O2 production was obtained. The present study provides direct evidence for a platelet-dependent mechanism capable of controlling the PMN production of highly reactive oxidants and, in turn, the PMN cytolytic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Low frequencies of renal sympathetic nerve stimulation increase renal tubular sodium reabsorption without causing renal hemodynamic changes. We tested the hypothesis that the natriuretic responses to synthetic atrial peptides (atriopeptin III [APIII], 24 amino acids) are modulated by the renal tubular actions of the renal nerves. Responses to intravenous infusions of APIII (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/min) were examined in three groups of chloralose-anesthetized rats. Bilateral renal function studies were done in all three groups in which the right kidney was denervated and the left kidney was either left innervated (group I, n = 10) or the distal portion of the transected left renal nerves was stimulated at 15 V, 1 msec, and 0.5 Hz (group II, n = 8) or 1.0 Hz (group III, n = 8). In groups I, II, and III, diuretic and natriuretic responses to APIII were significantly (p less than 0.05) less in the kidneys with intact innervation or low-frequency (0.5 and 1.0 Hz) renal nerve stimulation than in the denervated kidneys. In conclusion, renal excretory responses to APIII are substantially modulated by the renal tubular actions resulting from low-frequency renal nerve stimulation. We speculate that the decrease in renal excretory responses to atrial peptides in pathophysiologic states such as congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis may result in part from an increase in the prevailing level of renal sympathetic nerve activity.\r"

  ".U": "90038899\r", 
  ".W": "Many stresses, including elevated temperature and exposure to toxins or heavy metals, activate a stereotyped response of cultured cells known as the heat-shock response. The products of several highly conserved heat-shock genes (heat-shock proteins) protect the cells against subsequent stresses. The intracellular signal for the response is unknown, but may include the presence of damaged and abnormal proteins in the cell. Ethanol at high concentration (1.3 mol/L) has been shown to activate the heat-shock response in hamster ovary fibroblasts, suggesting that this response might be an important consequence of exposure of cells to ethanol and might mediate some of its cellular toxicity. To determine if lower concentrations of ethanol or its metabolites could activate a heat-shock response, we transfected COS-1 cells with a reporter gene (the Drosophila 70 kd heat-shock protein promoter fused to the beta-galactosidase gene), then exposed them to various compounds. Exposure to heat induced at least a threefold to fourfold increase in beta-galactosidase activity, whereas 1.3 mol/L ethanol induced a sixfold increase. Lower concentrations of ethanol (100 to 500 mmol/L) or acetaldehyde (100 to 500 mumol/L) did not induce a measurable heat-shock response. Similarly, high concentrations of metabolites generated during ethanol oxidation (10 mmol/L lactate or acetate) did not induce the response. We conclude that the heat-shock response cannot be detected with this assay system in COS-1 cells after short exposure to physiologically achievable concentrations of ethanol or its metabolites. However, it is possible that it is induced at a low level or in tissues directly exposed to alcoholic beverages (e.g., oropharynx, esophagus, and stomach).\r"

  ".U": "90038901\r", 
  ".W": "At the 12.5 micrograms level, minoxidil prevents the irreversible aggregation of platelets by 2 x 10(-6) mol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Levels of minoxidil greater than 12.5 micrograms cause a reversal of primary aggregation by 2 x 10(-6) mol/L ADP. Aggregation of platelets in response to 125 micrograms of arachidonic acid is measurably reduced by 12.5 micrograms of minoxidil and totally suppressed by 30 micrograms. Concurrent with the inhibition of platelet aggregation, increasing concentrations of minoxidil cause a gradual reduction in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). In the presence of 100 micrograms of minoxidil, PGE2 is reduced from a control value of 87.7 +/- 2.2 pg/ml to 23.9 +/- 3.2 pg/ml. At this level of minoxidil, TxB2 drops from 105 +/- 3.3 ng/ml to 10.5 +/- 2.6 ng/ml. The effect of minoxidil on platelet aggregation is not associated with increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis. All data support the conclusion that minoxidil functions (in platelet metabolism) primarily as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor.\r"

In this article we describe studies designed to localize the site at which protein intake alters loop sodium uptake (JNa) in rats fed diets containing either 6% or 40% protein for approximately 8 to 10 days. In vivo microperfusion demonstrated that luminal bumetanide (10(-5) mol/L) fully reversed the stimulation of JNa by high-protein intake, thus suggesting that high-protein intake stimulates salt transport in the thick ascending limb. In vitro studies supported this possibility, showing that high-protein intake significantly increased sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (NaK ATPase) activity in homogenates of outer renal medulla (68%) and in dissected medullary thick ascending limbs (87%). This effect was partly selective, since high-protein intake did not alter NaK ATPase activity in superficial renal cortex, had a smaller and statistically insignificant effect on NaK ATPase activity in dissected pars rectae, and did not affect magnesium ATPase activity in any tissue. Furthermore, this effect did not appear to require hypertrophy, since high-protein intake for approximately 8 days did not detectably alter the relative amounts of tissue protein and DNA in either medulla or cortex. A last series of studies demonstrated that high-protein intake increased plasma aldosterone levels. We conclude that increased protein intake stimulates salt reabsorption predominantly in the thick ascending limb, an effect that is partly selective; does not appear to require hypertrophy; and may be related to increased plasma aldosterone levels.\r"

Based on prevalence rates from a socio-economically and ethnically comparable Danish county, the annual incidence rate was calculated to be 0.045 per diabetic. The incidence rate of moderate and severe episodes (bicarbonate less than 16 mmol/l) was 0.032 and of severe episodes only (bicarbonate less than 10 mmol/l) 0.017 per diabetic. The major risk group was female teenagers. The total annual frequency of recurrence was 8.7%: 48% of the male episodes were ketoacidosis (DKA) associated with onset of diabetes, against 30% of the female episodes (P = 0.02). All Danish diabetics were at the time of the survey (1978-79) treated with conventional insulin treatment. Annual incidence rate in these established diabetics was 0.028, i.e. three to five times less than reported during treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Mortality of DKA was low, 3.4%, and dependent upon age and precipitating factor but not upon the degree of acidosis. The overall annual mortality rate was 1.5 per 100 diabetics.\r"

GFR was measured after an intravenous bolus injection of 100 microCi 51Cr-EDTA by determination of plasma radioactivity in venous blood samples taken from the other arm 180, 200, 220 and 240 min after the injection (II). The plasma radioactivity in the sample drawn 240 min after injection was used in method I. During the mean investigation period of 32 months (12-62 months) a total of 184 GFR determinations were performed. The average interval between the GFR measurements was 6 months (1-21 months). In 127/184 of the study intervals method I indicated a decrease in GFR. The corresponding figure for method II was almost identical, 130/184. The mean decline in GFR was 8.1 +/- 7.2 and 7.8 +/- 6.9 ml year-1 1.73 m-2 using methods I and II, respectively (NS). The methods essentially provided the same GFR values in absolute terms (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). We conclude that the one plasma sample method can be used as a valid routine technique in non-uraemic patients with nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Among civilians in the United States, 33,000 gunshot wound deaths occur each year; probably half of these involve the head. In combat, head wounds account for approximately half of the immediate mortality when death can be attributed to a single wound. No significant reduction in the neurosurgical mortality associated with these wounds has occurred between World War II and the Vietnam conflict, and very little research into missile wounds of the brain has been undertaken. An experimental model has been developed in the anesthetized cat whereby a ballistic injury to the brain may be painlessly reproduced in order that the pathophysiological effects of brain wounding may be studied and better treatments may be designed to lower the mortality and morbidity rates associated with gunshot wounds. Prominent among physiological effects observed in this model was respiratory arrest even though the missile did not injure the brain stem directly. The incidence of prolonged respiratory arrest increased with increasing missile energy, but arrest was often reversible provided respiratory support was given. It is possible that humans who receive a brain wound die from missile-induced apnea instead of brain damage per se. The mortality rate in humans with brain wounding might be reduced by prompt respiratory support. Brain wounding was associated with persistently increased intracranial pressure and reduced cerebral perfusion pressure not entirely attributable to intracranial bleeding. The magnitude of these derangements appeared to be missile energy-dependent and approached dangerous levels in higher-energy wounds. All wounded cats exhibited postwounding increases in blood glucose concentrations consistent with a generalized stress reaction. A transient rise in hematocrit also occurred immediately after wounding. Both of these phenomena could prove deleterious to optimal brain function after injury.\r"

From the scintigraphic findings, platelet survival times, and clinical information, thrombocytopenia was ascribed to decreased production or to increased destruction. Two patients were found to have bone marrow production defects. Two patients with hemangiomas were studied. In one, the hemangioma was shown not to be the cause of thrombocytopenia. In the second, the hemangioma was proven the source of platelet destruction, but was much more extensive than clinically evident. In both, surgical manipulation of the hemangioma was avoided. Six additional patients had thrombocytopenia due to accelerated destruction. In four, the spleen was shown responsible. In two, however, the spleen was shown not to be responsible for the low platelet counts, and splenectomy was avoided. Thus, 111In-platelet scintigraphy and survival studies are valuable in the classification and management of childhood thrombocytopenia. We believe that this study should be performed, when possible, in any child with thrombocytopenia where the mechanism is unclear or the therapeutic intervention involves splenectomy or resection of a hemangioma.\r"

Therefore, we studied the uptake of [131I]HIPDM in various pathophysiological models in mice (chronic alcoholism, diabetes with beta-cell atrophy and obesity with beta-cell hypertrophy) and compared to 14C-L-Tryptophan (TRY) distribution in order to determine the factors influencing their pancreatic uptake. In normal animals, the pancreas uptake of TRY was generally higher than HIPDM. In diabetes, the relative concentration of both compounds was higher over the controls; however, in obesity, TRY showed lower accumulation than in controls while HIPDM showed no significant difference. Chronic ethanol (20%) ingestion increased TRY uptake in the pancreas compared to controls (36.88 +/- 3.21 vs. 30.03 +/- 4.17% ID/g; p less than 0.01) after 5 wk study period, but it decreased by 10 wk (22.36 +/- 0.95% ID/g; p less than 0.005). There were no significant changes in [131I]HIPDM distribution in alcoholics as compared to the controls. Radioiodinated HIPDM has potential advantages over [11C]TRY for pancreatic imaging since conventional imaging techniques can be employed. Our data, however, suggest that 11C-L-TRY is a more sensitive indicator of various pancreatic disorders.\r"

There were no significant differences in triglyceride concentrations among the three groups; free fatty acids, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations for group 2 patients were similar to those of group 1 patients or fell between values for group 1 and group 3 patients.

  ".W": "Kappa receptor multiplicity is a complex area. We now present evidence from binding studies suggesting the existence of four kappa receptor subtypes. The guinea pig cerebellum contains high levels of U50,488-sensitive, or kappa 1, receptors. Kappa opiates (U50,488, tifluadom, Mr2034, Mr2266 and Win44,441) compete [3H]ethylketocyclazocine binding to kappa 1 receptors with kappa, values under 10 nM and Hill coefficients of approximately one, as does dynorphin A (kappa 1, 0.27 +/- 0.05 nM; Hill coefficient, 0.83 +/- 0.20, n = 4). However, competition studies with dynorphin B yield a Hill coefficient of 0.46 +/- 0.03 (n = 5) and nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curve is best fit by two sites. alpha-Neoendorphin Neoendorphin competition curves (Hill coefficient, 0.46 +/- 0.07; n = 3) also were best fit with two components. Competition studies with both alpha-neoendorphin and dynorphin B together suggest that both compounds label the same site with high affinity. Similar results were obtained using [3H]U69,593. Dynorphin B and alpha-neoendorphin competed binding with Hill coefficients of 0.45 +/- 0.04 (n = 3) and 0.59 +/- 0.09 (n = 3), respectively. These data suggest two subtypes of kappa 1 receptors in the guinea pig cerebellum: kappa 1a and kappa 1b. Classical kappa opiates and dynorphin A have high affinity for both subtypes whereas dynorphin B and alpha-neoendorphin label kappa 1b over 50-fold more potently than kappa 1a sites. [3H]Naloxone benzoylhydrazone [( 3H]NalBzoH) labels a novel, U50,488-insensitive kappa receptor subtype, kappa 3, in membranes from calf striatum, rat and mouse brain. We now have developed a relatively selective assay in calf striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin (SRIF) is a neurotransmitter in the brain. Subtypes of SRIF receptors may mediate the diverse physiological actions of SRIF in the central nervous system. In the present study, the characteristics of subtypes of brain SRIF receptors were examined using two SRIF analogs. [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I]MK 678. [125I]CGP 23996 binds selectively to rat brain SRIF receptors in a saturable manner and with high affinity. [125I]CGP 23996 binding to brain SRIF receptors is inhibited by SRIF agonists with a rank order of potency of SRIF greater than cyclo (aha-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys) greater than SMS 201-995 much greater than MK 678 = L-363,301. [125I]MK 678 labels rat brain SRIF receptors which are not detected by low nanomolar concentrations of [125I]CGP 23996. [125I]MK 678 binding to brain membranes is saturable and of high affinity with a Kd of 0.3 nM and a Bmax of 217 fmol/mg of protein in brain and a Kd of 0.17 nM and a Bmax of 211 fmol/mg of protein in anterior pituitary. [125I]MK 678 binding to brain SRIF receptors is blocked selectively by SRIF analogs. SRIF, SRIF 28, D-Trp8 SRIF, SMS 201-995, cyclo (aha-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys) and MK 678 have similar potencies to inhibit [125I]MK 678 binding to brain SRIF receptors. The different rank order of potencies of SRIF analogs to inhibit [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I]MK 678 binding to brain SRIF receptors suggests that these radioligands interact with different subtypes of brain SRIF receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Vagal stimulation is known to release gastrointestinal serotonin. The effect of depletion of serotonin stores on vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion and motility was studied in rats. Pretreatment of rats with parachlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) did not alter basal gastric acid and serotonin secretion but produced a 57% reduction in the intraluminal gastric release of serotonin and a 43 to 100% potentiation of the gastric acid secretory response elicited by intracisternal injection of the stable thyrotropin-releasing hormone analog, RX 77368, in conscious pylorus-ligated rats or urethane-anesthetized rats with an acute gastric fistula. Dose-response studies revealed that the gastric acid secretion induced by submaximal but not high doses of RX 77368 was elevated significantly by p-CPA pretreatment. p-CPA also enhanced the gastric acid output produced by submaximal, but not high doses of the vagal stimulant baclofen, [beta-(p-chlorophenyl)-gamma-aminobutyric acid]. In contrast, p-CPA pretreatment had no effect on gastric acid secretion stimulated by bethanechol, histamine or pentagastrin. Selective depletion of central serotonin stores by pretreatment with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine given alone, or combined with parachloroamphetamine did not alter RX 77368-stimulated gastric acid secretion. In addition, gastric contractility stimulated by intracisternal injection of RX 77368 was significantly enhanced by p-CPA but not by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine pretreatment, whereas the contractile response to carbachol was not altered by p-CPA pretreatment. These results suggest that depletion of peripheral but not central serotonergic stores potentiate gastric acid secretion and contractility induced by vagally, but not peripherally acting gastric stimulants. Thus, peripheral serotonin may exert an inhibitory tone on vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion and motility in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "A recent report from our laboratory gave evidence showing that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-7-oic acid has antinociceptive activity in the mouse. We also pointed out that this substance, which is a major metabolite of THC in most species including humans, is probably responsible for the well known analgesic properties of the parent drug. The present report contains findings that suggest THC-7-oic acid may have considerable activity as an antagonist to platelet activating factor, which may also explain the known properties of THC as a bronchodilator, antipyretic and antirheumatic agent. In the mouse ear edema test, THC-7-oic acid appeared to be about as efficacious as phenidone; however, its potency was less than either phenidone or indomethacin. When compared with the parent drug, THC, in the platelet activating factor-induced paw edema assay, it acted more quickly and produced a greater reduction of edema. This is consistent with the possibility that THC must be metabolized to the 7-oic acid for activity to be seen. Its activity in preventing platelet activating factor-induced mortality was comparable to naproxen. In vitro studies suggest that THC-7-oic acid can inhibit both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase activities in intact cells.\r"

In this study, changes in cardiac myocyte-free cytosolic calcium stimulated by angiotensin II were monitored with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fura-2. There was an initial peak transient increase followed by a sustained increase in cytosolic-free calcium in response to angiotensin II (10(-9)-10(-6) M). The peak transient response in cytosolic-free calcium after addition of angiotensin II (10(-7) M) occurred at 23 +/- 4 sec and was stimulated 2.16-fold (332 +/- 56 nM) above basal levels (154 +/- 14.7 nM). The calcium response was blocked or reversed by addition of verapamil (10(-8) M), lanthanum (0.2 mM) and zero calcium buffer. Angiotensin II receptor-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphates was quantified after separation by high-performance liquid chromatography in cultured chick heart cells prelabeled with L-myo-[1,2-3H(N)]inositol. A time course indicated that the peak response of the angiotensin II (10(-8) M)-stimulated increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate was at 30 sec. Angiotensin II (10(-8) M) significantly stimulated inositol-1,4-diphosphate (45%) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (78%) above basal levels. Bordetella pertussis toxin treatment of myocyte cultures in doses (500 ng/ml, 24 hr) shown to fully ADP-ribosylate a toxin-sensitive 41 KD alpha-subunit, blocked completely the angiotensin II-stimulated increases in inositol 1,4-diphosphate, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate.

Indwelling vascular catheters and a Doppler flow probe were implanted chronically to allow subsequent recording of femoral pressure, heart rate and iliac blood flow before and during the treatment while the rats were awake. On days 7 and 21, average femoral pressure were significantly higher in rats treated with either saline or l-deprenyl than in those treated with clorgyline. Pressor responses elicited by injecting graded doses of phenylephrine, angiotensin or tyramine i.v. were always accompanied by bradycardia and reduced iliac flow. Magnitude of all responses was unaltered in control rats treated with the saline vehicle. In rats treated with l-deprenyl responses to tyramine were enhanced slightly, but in those treated with clorgyline enhancement was more pronounced and included not only responses to tyramine but also those to phenylephrine and angiotensin. Because clorgyline inhibits MAO A whereas l-deprenyl inhibits MAO B our findings imply that enhanced pressor responsiveness depends on inhibition of MAO A rather than MAO B.\r"

Gastric antisecretory doses of rioprostil (10 and 100 micrograms/kg/day) decreased lesion scores by 71 to 77 and 90 to 93% after 7 and 11 days, respectively. A nonantisecretory dose of rioprostil (3 micrograms/kg/day) decreased lesion scores by 80% after 14 days. In contrast, lesion scores in dogs receiving either vehicle or a maximal gastric antisecretory dose of cimetidine (30 mg/kg/day) remained unchanged during the 28-day course of treatment. In addition, rioprostil prevented the weight loss which accompanied daily administration of aspirin (975 mg) in vehicle- or cimetidine-treated dogs. When cimetidine-treated dogs were switched to daily rioprostil (100 micrograms/kg/day) and aspirin (975 mg/day) therapy, lesions healed within 6 days. In separate studies, rioprostil had no effect on the sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to subsequent aspirin administration. In addition, discontinuation of maintenance therapy during rioprostil treatment was of no increased benefit (i.e., lesions did not heal faster). Finally, in a model of urate-induced knee-joint synovitis, rioprostil treatment did not inhibit the anti-inflammatory or analgesic efficacy of aspirin, or have any proinflammatory effect of its own.\r"

In the present study we used immunoblot analysis and specific catalytic activities to identify two isozymes of cytochrome P450 (P450IIE1 and P450IA1) in rabbit bone marrow microsomal preparations. P450IIB1, P450IIC1, P450IIIA6 and P450IA2 were below detectable levels using immunoblot analysis. P450IIE1 was present at a concentration of 0.0065 nmol/mg of microsomal protein in marrow microsomes from untreated rabbits, and it was induced 12.9-fold by acetone treatment. The change in the P450IIE1 apoprotein determined immunochemically in bone marrow microsomes after acetone treatment was paralleled by a 9.4-fold increase in benzene hydroxylation, a P450IIE1-dependent activity. Aroclor 1254 pretreatment induced P450IA1 in marrow microsomes 11-fold to a specific content of about 0.025 nmol/mg of microsomal protein. 7-Ethoxyresorufin deethylation, a P450IA1-dependent activity, was induced 15.7-fold by Aroclor 1254 treatment. The increases in the enzymic activities are consistent with an increase in catalytically competent holoenzymes. The presence of these two isozymes in bone marrow could result in the metabolic activation of compounds in the bone marrow producing toxic metabolites at the site of toxicity.\r"

To verify these observations, we initiated a prospective randomized phase II-III trial of etoposide and cisplatin, with or without IFN-beta and IFN-gamma, in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. Thirty-seven patients were randomized to receive either two cycles of chemotherapy or 6 weeks of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma followed by two cycles of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of 60 mg of cisplatin/m2 on day 1 and 120 mg of etoposide/m2 on days 4, 6, and 8, repeated every 21 days. Patients who were randomized to the IFN plus chemotherapy arm received 200 micrograms of IFN-gamma and 30 x 10(6) U of IFN-beta three times per week for 6 weeks, followed by two cycles of chemotherapy. Three of 18 (17%) eligible patients in the chemotherapy arm and two of 18 (11%) patients in the combination arm had partial responses. All responses occurred while patients were receiving chemotherapy. Median survival was 190 days for the chemotherapy arm and 246 days in the combined modality arm, as estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves (P = .35). We observed no significant difference in subjective toxic effects between the two arms. We observed more hematologic toxicity during chemotherapy on the combined modality arm (P = .02). We conclude that pretreatment with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma does not enhance the efficacy of etoposide and cisplatin in this disease. Although the combined modality arm is relatively well tolerated, it does result in more chemotherapy-associated toxic effects. This study also exemplifies a hybrid phase II-III trial design, which is useful in allowing phase II results to be quickly incorporated into a phase III trial.\r"

A significant likelihood of C-spine fracture was seen in patients with respiratory compromise (100%), motor dysfunction (54.5%), and altered sensorium (8.9%) (p less than 0.001). No fractures were seen in asymptomatic patients (p less than 0.001). Cervical spine radiography should be performed in patients with abnormal neurologic findings or symptoms referable to the neck. In alert asymptomatic patients, cervical spine radiography may be omitted.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which varicocele caused infertility is not yet clear. Endocrine factors have been suggested to explain impaired spermatogenesis in patients with varicocele. We conducted a prospective study on testosterone and gonadotropin levels and their response to the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone test to determine the possible role of a hormonal defect in subfertility. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone tests were performed on 11 subfertile men with varicocele preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The differences in the luteinizing hormone response were statistically significant. The maximal luteinizing hormone levels also were significantly lower in patients whose spermiogram changed postoperatively. No significant changes were noted in testosterone and other gonadotropin levels postoperatively. A prognostic correlation between the change in response of luteinizing hormone to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (preoperatively and postoperatively) and improvement in fertility (pregnancy success) was found. We suggest that the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone test should be considered to estimate the hormonal derangement and also the prognosis of an operation in subfertile men with varicocele.\r"

Serum testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin was markedly reduced in most patients, with the median level increasing from 0.25 to 1.65 nmol. per l. A second human chorionic gonadotropin test was repeated later in 5 patients who had been off treatment for a median of 6 months. Median serum testosterone levels increased to a maximum of 2.6 nmol. per l. compared to 28.2 nmol. per l. in an age-matched control group (p equals 0.008). Therefore, we conclude that long-term treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in elderly men leads to gonadal impairment that may not be as reversible as generally suggested.\r"

Meiosis repair deficient male Drosophila melanogaster mei-9, mei-41, and the double mutant mei-9-41 were allowed to mate with attached -x females on media containing the test agent. Genotoxic agents produce DNA damage which accumulates and can be lethal in mei males, whereas the attached -x females are able to repair the damage and survive. Thus, the sex ratio of the progeny is a measure of genotoxicity which can be correlated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, tea, coffee, and saccharin were not genotoxic (p greater than 0.3). Dose dependent toxicity was observed in bracken fern (p less than 0.001). The known mutagen and bladder carcinogen, cyclophosphamide, was highly genotoxic (p less than .001). Drosophila genotoxicity not only permits rapid screening of mutagens, but may also have advantages over other systems in the screening of potential bladder carcinogens.\r"

These studies were designed to assess the degree of urothelial damage produced by the mildest EDTA formulation which has been reported to be effective. Rabbit bladders were irrigated antegrade via a ureterotomy for 20 hours and then removed for histological examination. A 0.03 M solution of disodium EDTA at pH 7.5 produced considerably more urothelial injury than did an otherwise identical solution of calcium EDTA (p = 0.006). The bladders from the latter group were undistinguishable from those irrigated with saline. As prior saturation of EDTA with calcium completely eliminated the tissue injury, these studies indicate that the same calcium chelating property which makes this chemical effective also makes it toxic. There was enough tissue damage from the relatively mild formulation used to suggest no EDTA solution yet formulated is safe for clinical use.\r"

Seven patients with lower extremity ischemia and one patient with upper extremity ischemia had peripheral arterial thromboses (five arteries, three grafts) confirmed by clinical history, physical examination, and angiography. The duration of occlusion ranged from 31 hours to 30 days (mean 11.9 days). Tissue-type plasminogen activator was infused via a catheter directly into the thrombus at a randomly assigned dose of 0.05 mg/kg/hr (n = 4) or 0.025 mg/kg/hr (n = 4). Thrombolysis was complete in seven patients and partial in one. Duration of infusion ranged from 1 hour to 21 hours (mean 7.4 hours). The low dose required a longer infusion than did the high dose, but they were both successful in achieving thrombolysis. The one patient with partial thrombolysis had abrupt discontinuation of infusion when extravasation through a recently endarterectomized femoral artery developed. Otherwise there were no significant complications from tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Secondary procedures to correct underlying arterial disease were performed in five of the seven patients (71%) who had complete thrombolysis. Even at low dosages, infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator into arteries or bypass graft thrombus produced complete thrombolysis, and no major complications occurred. This allowed more systematic effects to diagnose and treat underlying arterial disease.\r"

Accordingly, we estimated the economic costs of type II, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus, reflecting its contribution to the total burden of disease in the United States. In 1986, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was responsible for $11.6 billion in health care expenditures, including $6.8 billion for diabetic care and $4.8 billion attributable to an excess prevalence of related (principally cardiovascular) conditions. The human toll of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus included 144,000 deaths -- about 6.8% of total US mortality -- and the total disability of 951,000 persons. The total economic burden of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 1986, including health care expenditures and productivity forgone due to disability and premature mortality, was $19.8 billion.\r"

As part of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction II trial, this study investigated the time delays that preceded treatment of 236 consecutive patients with intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (TPA) during acute myocardial infarction. The average (+/- SD) time from the onset of symptoms to treatment with TPA was 153 +/- 54 minutes. After arrival in the emergency department, patients waited an average of 19.9 +/- 17.8 minutes for the initial electrocardiogram. Following the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram, an additional 70 +/- 40 minutes elapsed before thrombolytic therapy began. The interval between the initial electrocardiogram and initiation of treatment with TPA was less when the drug was first administered in the emergency department (46.8 +/- 23.4 minutes) rather than after transfer to the coronary care unit (82.1 +/- 34.7 minutes). In-hospital delays at the two academic and two private hospitals accounted for more than half of the total time from the onset of symptoms to initiation of thrombolytic therapy. We conclude that significant in-hospital delays are likely to occur before a patient receives thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Various factors conspire to create these delays, but a well-organized team approach to treatment will help to minimize delays in the implementation of this new form of therapy.\r"

Since endogenous circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptides are elevated during volume expansion and since atrial natriuretic peptides have been shown to blunt or block the vasoconstrictive effects of various pharmacologic agents, we examined the effect of atriopeptin II infusion on contrast medium-induced alterations in renal blood flow. Transient changes in renal blood flow were measured with an electromagnetic flow probe following bolus injections of the contrast medium, sodium meglumine diatrizoate (Renovist II, 2 ml/4 sec), into the renal arteries of dogs. Under control conditions (that is, saline vehicle), the bolus of contrast medium caused an initial 15 to 21% increase in renal blood flow at 14 to 21 seconds, followed by a subsequent 5 to 13% decrease in renal blood flow at 43 to 59 seconds after injection. Infusion of atriopeptin II (0.05 pg/kg/min) into the renal artery did not alter arterial blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or baseline renal blood flow, but did produce increases in urine flow rate and clearance of sodium. The infusion of atriopeptin II attenuated the contrast medium-induced reduction in RBF, but the infusion of a threshold dose of bradykinin (1 ng/kg/min) had no effect. These results suggest that low doses of atriopeptin II can selectively attenuate the vasoconstrictive effects of contrast medium on renal blood flow without influencing systemic hemodynamics.\r"

Using the unilateral model we found a markedly reduced diuretic and natriuretic response to the infusion of synthetic rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP 1-28) in proteinuric kidney but not in contralateral kidney, despite a comparable increase in glomerular filtration rate. To explain the blunted diuresis and natriuresis in the presence of normal glomerular response to ANP, we investigated the possibility of an abnormality at post-glomerular level by studying ANP receptor density and affinity of the inner stripe of outer medulla and the inner medulla in ADR-and vehicle-treated rats. The inner stripe of outer medulla and the inner medulla receptor density and affinity were not significantly different in ADR rats as compared to animals given the vehicle alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To better understand the mechanisms which might cause the typical membrane changes in dysmorphic erythrocytes in vivo, we have exposed normal human erythrocytes in vitro to an osmotic and enzymatic environment similar to that of the nephron. In addition, treated or untreated erythrocytes were exposed to a hemolytic environment. The morphology of the cells was evaluated by light and electron microscopy in comparison of that of dysmorphic erythrocytes obtained in vivo. Neither the passage of erythrocytes in sequence through various solutions each simulating the tubule fluid in a different part of the nephron, nor exposure to urinary or renal enzymes or to serum per se causes the typical membrane alterations. Upon exposure of passaged erythrocytes to a hemolytic environment, however, 50 to 90% of the cells become dysmorphic in a time and dose dependent fashion. By light and electron microscopy these dysmorphic erythrocytes obtained in vitro are indistinguishable from those obtained in vivo. In contrast, non-passaged red blood cells are not affected by the same hemolytic environment. We conclude that osmotically challenged erythrocytes exposed to a hemolytic environment develop dysmorphic membrane alterations.\r"

Following a prenephrectomy inulin clearance determination (CIn), the left kidney was excised, flushed with Eurocollins solution, and cold-stored for 24 hours. Immediately following reperfusion and a 10 minute equilibration period, baseline CIn was measured over a 20-minute time interval (Collection Period I). Experimental animals (N = 11) then received 1 mcg/kg sANP by intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion at 0.3 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes. CIn was measured throughout the infusion (Collection Period II). Normal saline was substituted for sANP in control animals (N = 11). CIn was also measured 24 hours following reimplantation in seven control and seven sANP-treated animals. Autograft inulin clearance increased from 0.32 +/- 0.11 ml/min during Period I to 2.5 +/- 0.6 ml/min during sANP infusion (P less than 0.01). This increase in CIn associated with ANP infusion was accompanied by increases in urine flow rate (V) (0.15 +/- 0.05 ml/min to 0.98 +/- 0.21 ml/min, P less than 0.01) and renal blood flow (RBF) measured by electromagnetic flow probe (85 +/- 17 ml/min to 171 +/- 13 ml/min, P less than 0.05). No significant changes in CIn, V, or RBF occurred in control animals between periods I and II. Although systemic blood pressure declined during sANP infusion, it did not decrease to an extent that compromised peripheral perfusion. CIn determined 24 hours after autograft reimplantation in the ANP-treated animals approximated or exceeded values determined during ANP infusion (Period II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fibrin deposits are frequently observed in the course of proliferative extracapillary glomerulonephritis and could be related to a defective local fibrinolysis. We studied human glomerular epithelial cells in culture which were found to release mainly a urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) identified on zymography by its molecular weight (53 kD), its plasminogen activator activity, and its neutralization by specific polyclonal anti-u-PA IgG. Trace amounts of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) complexed to a plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were identified with specific antibodies. Specific binding sites were found at the surface of glomerular epithelial cells (kD: 2.10(-9) M), partially occupied by secreted u-PA. The spontaneous u-PA activity of the culture medium conditioned by glomerular epithelial cells was very low, suggesting that u-PA was released in its inactive single chain proenzyme form (SC-u-PA). After activation of SC-u-PA by plasmin, u-PA activity of the culture medium was found to increase in a time- and dose-dependent manner when cells were incubated with phorbol myristic acetate (PMA). This effect was inhibited by H7, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Stimulation of u-PA synthesis by PMA was also observed in two different epithelial tubular cell lines. LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells. However, 8 bromo cyclic AMP which increased u-PA release by LLC-PK1 cells was found to inhibit u-PA release by PMA-stimulated glomerular epithelial cells and MDCK cells. By Northern blot analysis we found that PMA induced an increase of u-PA mRNA level in glomerular epithelial cells and that cyclic AMP had an opposite effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seven dehydrated volunteers received three hour infusions of 0.8 pmol kg-1 min-1 of human alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (h-alpha ANP) or vehicle alone (Ve) in a single-blind, randomized cross-over design. H-alpha ANP infusion increased plasma h-alpha ANP from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 20.3 +/- 6.4 pm. H-alpha ANP suppressed plasma renin activity from 3.30 +/- 0.48 to 1.37 +/- 0.35 ng ml-1 hr-1 (P less than 0.001 vs. Ve). Plasma aldosterone was unaltered by h-alpha ANP. Fractional excretion of filtered sodium (FENa) changed from 0.92 +/- 0.09 to 1.13 +/- 0.16% with h-alpha ANP, and from 1.02 +/- 0.09 to 0.69 +/- 0.11% with Ve (P less than 0.01 h-alpha ANP vs. Ve). FEK was unchanged. FEpo4 increased from 7.2 +/- 1.2 to 9.2 +/- 1.2% and FELi from 22.1 +/- 1.4 to 24.9 +/- 3.0% with h-alpha ANP (both P less than 0.05 vs. Ve). H-alpha ANP decreased mean urinary osmolality by approximately 150 mOsmol kg-1 compared to Ve (P less than 0.01). GFR, RPF and filtration fraction were unchanged by h-alpha ANP, H-alpha ANP was associated with a significant tachycardia (P less than 0.01 vs. Ve) but with no significant change in arterial pressure. These results suggest that small increments of plasma h-alpha ANP, mimicking physiological changes, are natriuretic at least partly by reducing proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium, and also impair urinary concentration.\r"

In addition, renal amyloid stones of three dialyzed patients were examined. All deposits and stones were of beta 2-microglobulin-origin (AB-amyloid) by immunohistochemical and immunochemical evaluation. Amyloid fibril extracts were dissolved in 80% formic acid and separated by high performance liquid chromatography in 60% formic acid and 20% 2-propanol. Three major retarded fractions with molecular weights of approximately 24, 12 and 7 to 10 kD were recovered. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis documented beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) as the principal polypeptide in all investigated cases. In addition to proteins with intact N-termini, one fragment commencing with isoleucine in position 7 was found in osseous or synovial amyloid. In renal amyloid stones, one additional fragment was found beginning with serine in position 20. Generally, these data point to proteolytic cleavage carboxyterminal to a lysine residue and establish that not only intact beta 2m but also at least one beta 2m fragment is present in beta 2m-derived amyloid deposits of patients with long-term hemodialysis. The fragmentation pattern is consistent with the action of lysine-specific protease(s) and underscores a potentially important role of limited proteolysis in the pathogenesis of AB-amyloid deposits.\r"

The cause of this disorder is unknown. The diagnosis is seldom made because of the chronic and asymptomatic nature of the condition. More than 90% of the cases are diagnosed at postmortem examination. Symptoms may include dyspnea, coughing, hemoptysis, hoarseness, and wheezing. Tomography of the trachea may reveal beaded calcification of the tracheobronchial cartilages. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic. Histologically, the abnormal growths show heterotopic bone formation. No known treatment is available. We describe two female patients, one with hemoptysis and another with asthmalike symptoms, in both of whom bronchoscopy established the diagnosis of tracheopathia osteoplastica. The first patient had recurrent episodes of pneumonia attributable to bronchial obstruction by bony projections. In the second patient, removal of large lesions that obstructed the upper part of the trachea relieved the dyspnea. Of interest is the fact that the first patient was the biologic mother of the second. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of familial occurrence of tracheopathia osteoplastica.\r"

Protein-calorie malnutrition is very prevalent in older patients with chronic disease, living alone, and receiving low income. Nutritional assessment and early intervention in the hospitalized elderly patient is extremely important to reduce the morbidity associated with this disease.\r"

The prevalence of anti-HCV was significantly higher in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (76%) than in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis alone (38.7%) whereas in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis there was no significant difference between those with and without primary liver cell cancer (81.4% and 77.5%, respectively). These results indicate that HCV infection may have a role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, even in patients with chronic liver disease apparently related to other agents such as alcohol, and that this recently identified hepatitis virus may be found in a large proportion of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis.\r"

In HBsAg-negative patients with hepatocellular carcinoma the prevalence of anti-HCV was lower than that in patients with non-A, non-B chronic hepatitis (16% vs 55%); the prevalence of serum antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), a marker of hepatitis B virus infection, was 70% and 28%, respectively.

Among recipients of WBi blood, 36% were WBi in their 6 month post-transfusion sample, but so were 42% of a control population that had received only WB-negative blood. When serial samples from recipients with a WBi pattern were tested on two occasions, only 35% of results were reproducible. No reciepient of WBi blood became EIA positive, true positive for WB, positive for HIV-1 antigen, or positive for EIA reactivity against recombinant p24 or gp41. The polymerase chain reaction was negative for gag and env HIV-1 sequences in all donors and recipients. Thus WBi patterns are exceedingly common in randomly selected donors and recipients and such patterns do not correlate with the presence of HIV-1 or the transmission of HIV-1 from donor to recipient.\r"

For fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)--stained rabbit aorta in vitro, the threshold for tissue blanching was 15 seconds of 100 mW exposure of cw argon ion laser compared with 15 seconds at 300 mW for unstained tissue. The threshold power density needed for argon laser welding of abdominal aortotomies in rabbits in vivo was 3.8 W/cm2 with FITC and 7.6 W/cm2 without the dye. However, bursting pressures for the two groups (164 mm Hg with FITC, 147 mm Hg without FITC) were not significantly different. Histology revealed decreased collateral thermal damage in FITC-enhanced welds. Use of photosensitizing dyes for tissue welding is feasible and may allow arterial welding with lower power laser systems and cause less thermal trauma by lowering threshold power levels.\r"

  ".W": "This review underscores the diversity of the clinical manifestations and hematopathological features of gamma heavy chain disease based on the detailed report of 16 patients evaluated in our chemical department, the analysis of 12 cases diagnosed in our laboratory, and the study of 81 cases previously reported. This condition is defined by the presence in the serum of immunoglobulin molecules composed of deleted gamma heavy chains devoid of light chains. The production by the monoclonal B cells of these peculiar proteins appears to result from multiple defects (deletions, insertions, and mutations) in both heavy and light chain genes leading to abnormal mRNA splicing. Gamma heavy chain disease is currently underdiagnosed. The diagnosis established by immunoelectrophoresis using specific antisera combined, in some instances, with the immunoselection procedure, can easily be missed on serum electrophoretic patterns: a narrow abnormal band suggestive of a monoclonal component was found in only 10 of our 28 cases. The amount of heavy chain disease protein in urine ranges from trace to 20 g/day and is usually moderate. Gamma heavy chain disease most often presents as a lymphoproliferative disorder featured by lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Extra-hematopoietic tumor localizations, such as cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement or thyroid tumor, may occur. Autoimmune disorders, notably rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenic purpura, are frequent (26% of cases). There is no specific histological pattern. The most frequent is a pleomorphic malignant lymphoplasmacytic proliferation mainly seen in bone marrow and lymph nodes. Some cases present with a predominantly plasmacytic proliferation or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other patients are affected with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of various morphologic types. Immunocytologic studies showed that a gamma heavy chain disease protein may occur in the context of a double monoclonal lymphoproliferative process or in various B or T cell malignancies that are not directly involved in the production of the abnormal immunoglobulin. In some patients, the histologic appearance of the enlarged lymphoid organs showed only a moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of uncertain malignancy. More important, some patients showed no evidence of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder after several years of follow-up. The clinical course of gamma heavy chain disease varies from an asymptomatic state to a rapidly progressive malignancy. The choice of therapy should entirely rely on the underlying clinicopathologic features, without taking into account the presence of the abnormal protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It is also seen in a group of patients who do not manifest any of the major clinical or serologic features of SLE, the majority of whom do not appear to progress to classical lupus. A multicenter study of 70 of these patients is documented and their major clinical and serologic characteristics examined: They have been characterized as suffering from a \"primary\" antiphospholipid syndrome and present typically with a history of deep vein thromboses, often accompanied by pulmonary thromboembolism, which in a few is complicated by thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, arterial occlusions (most commonly strokes), or fetal loss. The events are often recurrent and may be accompanied by hemocytopenias (thrombocytopenia and less frequently Coombs positivity and/or hemolytic anemia). They are often antinuclear antibody-negative and are always negative for antibodies to dsDNA and to ENA, typical serologic features of SLE. There may be a family history of SLE or a familial clotting tendency in a minority. The group of patients presented appears to be closely related, but distinctly separate from SLE.\r"

The onset of the disease tends to be subacute with an infrequent history of preceding infection or the discovery of a local source of infection. The presenting symptoms and signs fail to differentiate it from other types of endocarditis. Blood cultures are often negative for the first several days. Echocardiography has been useful in helping establish a diagnosis, and survival is favorable with medical and surgical therapy if the diagnosis is made early in the course of the disease. The disease can be quite aggressive, however, and lead to rapid clinical deterioration from valvular destruction and congestive heart failure. As with other forms of endocarditis, deterioration is an indication for aggressive management with early valve replacement.\r"

An understanding of the interrelationships between the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and the stress response will provide the nutritional support team with the background information necessary to meet the challenges imposed by TPN administration. The health care team will be able to recognize early signs and symptoms of complications and implement appropriate interventions. Individualized care plans can be formulated as an extension of the basic plan that has been presented, thus providing optimum care to the diabetic patient receiving nutritional support.\r"

  ".W": "Since the advent of Medicare's prospective payment system, beneficial but cost-increasing medical advances have been systematically assigned to existing diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) that do not cover the costs of the new technology. Recent evidence suggests that such underpayment reduces the rate at which hospitals adopt that technology. Safeguards designed to offset the negative incentives of underpayment, including the recalibration of DRG values, update factors, and the allowance of Medicare profits, appear not to have worked. We studied the case of cochlear implantation. Years after Food and Drug Administration approval and a favorable decision about Medicare coverage, payment for the device remains well below its average cost, and many hospitals ration the availability of the device to Medicare patients because of the financial losses involved. Eventually, so few patients received the implant that the original manufacturer discontinued its production. Under the DRG system, negative payment incentives compete with clinical considerations when hospitals and physicians decide whether to adopt specific cost-increasing new forms of technology of proved value. Other payment mechanisms that do not insert arbitrary financial considerations into specific treatment decisions should be considered instead.\r"

We expected that the effect of the prospective payment system might be reflected in changes between 1981 and 1985. Discharge rates for medical treatment of cardiovascular diseases were 2.9 percent higher in the United States than in Canada in 1981, but 1.8 percent lower in 1985; however, the case-mix index was 3.0 percent lower in 1981 and 4.8 percent higher in 1985. The case-mix index for combined medical and surgical discharges was 5.0 percent lower in the United States in 1981, but 10.7 percent higher in 1985. U.S. surgical discharge rates were 20 percent lower in 1981, but 20 percent higher in 1985. Rates of coronary bypass surgery were much higher in the United States in both years, but increased rapidly in both countries, particularly among those 75 and older. Elderly Canadians appeared to have access to cardiovascular surgery, with the exception of coronary bypass surgery, and to other hospital care for cardiovascular disease similar to that of elderly people in the United States.\r"

Of 15 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis documented by liver biopsy, all seroconverted for the antibody; of 5 with acute resolving non-A, non-B hepatitis, 3 (60 percent) seroconverted. The development of anti-HCV was delayed (mean delay, 21.9 weeks after transfusion, or 15 weeks after the onset of clinical hepatitis) and took approximately one year in one patient. Antibody has persisted in 14 of the 15 patients with chronic disease (mean follow-up, greater than or equal to 6.9 years; maximum, greater than or equal to 12), but has disappeared in the 3 with acute resolving disease after a mean of 4.1 years. Anti-HCV was detected in samples of donor serum given to 14 (88 percent) of the 16 anti-HCV-positive patients for whom all donor samples were available. Only 33 percent of the anti-HCV-positive donors tested had an elevated serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase; 54 percent were positive for antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). We conclude that hepatitis C virus is the predominant agent of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis and that screening of donors for anti-HCV could prevent the majority of cases of the disease. \"Surrogate\" assays for anti-HBc and alanine aminotransferase would have detected approximately half the anti-HCV-positive donors involved in the transmission of hepatitis that we identified.\r"

To assess the efficacy of therapy with the antiviral agent interferon alfa, we randomly assigned 166 patients with chronic hepatitis C to treatment with either 3 million or 1 million units of recombinant interferon alfa three times weekly for 24 weeks, or to no treatment. The probability of normalization or near normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase levels after six months of interferon therapy was 46 percent in patients treated with 3 million units of interferon (P less than 0.001) and 28 percent in those treated with 1 million units (P less than 0.02), but only 8 percent in untreated patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase level became completely normal in 22 of the 26 patients (85 percent) who responded to treatment with 3 million units of interferon and 9 of the 16 patients (56 percent) who responded to treatment with 1 million units. The patients who received 3 million units of interferon had histologic improvement because of the regression of lobular and periportal inflammation. Relapse within six months after the completion of treatment occurred in 51 percent of the patients treated with 3 million units of interferon and 44 percent of those treated with 1 million units. We conclude that a 24-week course of interferon therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in many patients with hepatitis C, although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common.\r"

We studied the effects of recombinant human interferon alfa in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with well-documented chronic hepatitis C. Forty-one patients were enrolled in the trial, 37 of whom were later found to have antibody to hepatitis C virus. Twenty-one patients received interferon alfa (2 million units) subcutaneously three times weekly for six months, and 20 received placebo. The mean serum aminotransferase levels and the histologic features of the liver improved significantly in the patients treated with interferon but not in the patients given placebo. Ten patients treated with interferon (48 percent) had a complete response, defined as a decline in mean serum aminotransferase levels to the normal range during therapy; three others had a decrease in mean aminotransferase levels of more than 50 percent. After treatment ended, however, serum aminotransferases usually returned to pretreatment levels; 6 to 12 months after the discontinuation of interferon therapy, only two patients (10 percent) still had normal values. We conclude that interferon alfa therapy is beneficial in reducing disease activity in chronic hepatitis C; however, the beneficial responses are often transient.\r"

  ".W": "Complementary DNAs derived from a mouse hybridoma messenger RNA were used to transform tobacco leaf segments followed by regeneration of mature plants. Plants expressing single gamma or kappa immunoglobulin chains were crossed to yield progeny in which both chains were expressed simultaneously. A functional antibody accumulated to 1.3% of total leaf protein in plants expressing full-length cDNAs containing leader sequences. Specific binding of the antigen recognized by these antibodies was similar to the hybridoma-derived antibody. Transformants having gamma- or kappa-chain cDNAs without leader sequences gave poor expression of the proteins. The increased abundance of both gamma- and kappa-chains in transformants expressing assembled gamma-kappa complexes was not reflected in increased mRNA levels. The results demonstrate that production of immunoglobulins and assembly of functional antibodies occurs very efficiently in tobacco. Assembly of subunits by sexual cross might be a generally applicable method for expression of heterologous multimers in plants.\r"

An Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding protein, purified from brain membranes, has been shown to be phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and localized by immunohistochemical techniques to intracellular particles associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the specificity of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding protein for inositol phosphates and the high affinity of the protein for Ins(1,4,5)P3 indicate that it is a physiological Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor mediating calcium release, direct evidence for this has been difficult to obtain. Also, it is unclear whether a single protein mediates both the recognition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and calcium transport or whether these two functions involve two or more distinct proteins. In the present study we report reconstitution of the purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding protein into lipid vesicles. We show that Ins(1,4,5)P3 and other inositol phosphates stimulate calcium flux in the reconstituted vesicles with potencies and specificities that match the calcium releasing actions of Ins(1,4,5)P3. These results indicate that the purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding protein is a physiological receptor responsible for calcium release.\r"

We also find that the human Nm23 protein has sequence homology over the entire translated region with a recently described developmentally regulated protein in Drosophila, encoded by the abnormal wing discs (awd) gene. Mutations in awd cause abnormal tissue morphology and necrosis and widespread aberrant differentiation in Drosophila, analogous to changes in malignant progression.

In an attempt to expand thymic cell populations in vivo and maintain them in vitro for such studies, we directed high levels of expression of the murine c-myc proto-oncogene in transgenic mice by inserting it into the mouse Thy-1 transcriptional unit. Such mice develop thymic tumours which contain proliferating thymocytes and, interestingly, expanded populations of epithelial cells. Both cell types can be maintained in vitro.\r"

Translocation of bcl-2 sequences from chromosome 18 to the JH segment of the immunoglobulin gene at chromosome band 14q32 in B cells results in deregulated expression of this gene, causing high steady state levels of bcl-2 messenger RNA2. DNA sequence data indicate that bcl-2 encodes two proteins by virtue of alternative splicing, designated as Bcl-2 alpha and Bcl-2 beta, with relative molecular masses of 26,000 and 22,000 respectively. Cell fractionation experiments indicate that the bcl-2 alpha gene product is located at the inner surface of the cell membrane, suggesting a possible role in mitogenic signal transduction. We report here that Bcl-2 alpha has GTP-binding activity and a protein sequence that suggests it belongs to the small molecular weight GTP-binding protein (G protein) family.\r"

This Ras-related protein is not a fragment of either of the subunits of cytochrome b, and its primary structure, as determined by the sequencing of its complementary DNA, is identical to that predicted from a recently cloned ras-related gene, rap1 (also termed Krev-1). Immunoaffinity purification on anti-cytochrome and anti-Ras immunoaffinity matrices indicates an association between cytochrome b and the Ras-related protein.

  ".U": "90044079\r", 
  ".W": "Transcription of eukaryotic genes requires an interaction between transcription factors that bind to the TATA box region, and transcriptional activators that bind to upstream activating sequences (UASs) or enhancers. Several yeast upstream transcriptional activators, such as GCN4, GAL4 and HAP1, seem to contain separate domains for binding to DNA and activating transcription. The expression of the cytochrome genes CYC1 and CYC7 is controlled by HAP1, which binds to dissimilar DNA sequences in UAS1 of CYC1 and the UAS of CYC7. HAP1 has a zinc-finger DNA-binding domain between amino-acid residues 1 and 148, and a highly acidic C-terminal activation domain between residues 1,308 and 1,483 (ref. 10). A mutant allele of the HAP1 gene, HAP1-18, leads to a change in Ser 63 to Arg 63, immediately adjacent to the zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain. The HAP1-18 mutation specifically abolishes the ability of the protein to bind to UAS1, but greatly increases the ability of the protein to activate transcription of CYC7. We now report that this increase in activation is mediated solely by the CYC7 UAS and the HAP1-18 protein, and also, that it is not caused by an altered binding affinity of the protein for the CYC7 UAS. Furthermore, even by substituting other amino acids at position 63 and over-expressing the resulting derivatives in vivo we were unable to increase activity at the UAS of CYC7 to the level obtained with HAP1-18. This rules out the possibility that the HAP1-18 mutation increases transcriptional activation by abolishing competition by UAS1 and UAS1-like sites for the protein. We thus conclude that HAP1-18 is a better activator of transcription than the wild-type protein when bound to the UAS of CYC7. Moreover, our findings indicate that in addition to the acidic activation domain, the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain participates directly in the activation of transcription.\r"

Precisely how such molecules operate is not fully understood, but evidence to date suggests a dual role, as receptors binding ligands on stimulator cells and by direct or indirect involvement in intracellular signalling events. In mouse, truncated 'tailless' CD8 molecules occur naturally (CD8 alpha' polypeptides) and although they are expressed on the surface of thymocytes, they are not expressed on the surface of mature T cells. In this study, we show that truncated CD8 molecules are impaired in their ability to interact with the protein tyrosine kinase, p56lck, and have decreased ability to restore immune responsiveness in vitro. Our data support a dual function for CD8 molecules correlated with expression of external domains and cytoplasmic domains, respectively. Both functions appear to be critical for a competent immune system in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The position-specific (PS) integrins of Drosophila are highly homologous to vertebrate integrins, most of which are cell-surface receptors for extracellular matrix components. Integrins are heterodimers, each consisting of noncovalently associated alpha- and beta-subunits. As for the subfamilies of vertebrate integrins, the same beta-subunit is found in both Drosophila PS integrins, combined with a specific alpha-subunit to generate either a complete functional PS1 or PS2 integrin. Both alpha- and beta-subunits are large transmembrane proteins (relative molecular masses greater than 100,000). Either one or both of these two PS integrins are expressed in most fly tissues during development. A particularly intriguing pattern of expression is found in the mature wing imaginal disc, where the PS1 integrin is expressed primarily on the presumptive dorsal wing epithelium, and the PS2 integrin is found almost exclusively on the ventral epithelium. Immediately after pupariation, the central wing pouch evaginates, folding along its centre to appose the epithelia that will secret the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the adult wing blade. Here we report the results of a genetic analysis indicating that both of the PS integrins are required to maintain the close apposition of the dorsal and ventral wing epithelia during morphogenesis. Also, we conclude that the integrins are not necessary for the maintenance of the cell lineage restriction between the two presumptive wing surfaces in the developing imaginal disc.\r"

  ".W": "In Drosophila the correct formation of the most anterior and posterior regions of the larva, acron and telson is dependent on the maternally expressed terminal class of genes. In their absence, the anterior head skeleton is truncated and all the structures posterior to the abdominal segment seven are not formed. The protein predicted to be encoded by one of these genes, torso (tor), seems to be a transmembrane protein with an extracytoplasmic domain acting as a receptor and a cytoplasmic domain containing tyrosine kinase activity. Here we report that another member of the terminal-genes class, l(1)polehole (l(1)ph), which is also zygotically expressed, is the Drosophila homologue of the v-raf oncogene and encodes a potential serine-and-threonine kinase. We also show that functional l(1)ph gene product is required for the expression of a gain-of-function tor mutant phenotype, indicating that l(1)ph acts downstream of tor. Together, these results support the idea that the induction of terminal development occurs through a signal transduction system, involving the local activation of the tor-encoded tyrosine kinase at the anterior and posterior egg poles, resulting in the phosphorylation of the l(1)ph gene product. In turn, downstream target proteins may be phosphorylated, ultimately leading to the regionalized expression of zygotic target genes. Such a process is in agreement with the finding that both tor and l(1)ph messenger RNAs are evenly distributed.\r"

Previous electron microscopic studies suggest that chromosomes condense in a non-uniform fashion at the nuclear periphery. But chromosome condensation is a complicated and dynamic process and requires continuous observation in living tissues to be fully understood. Using a recently developed three-dimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy technique, we have observed chromosomes as they relax from telophase, through interphase, until their condensation at the next prophase. This technique has been improved to produce higher-resolution images by implementing new stereographic projection and computational processing protocols. These studies have revealed that chromosomal regions on the nuclear envelope, distinct from the centromeres and telomeres, serve as foci for the decondensation and condensation of diploid chromosomes. The relative positions of the late decondensation sites at the beginning of interphase appear to correspond to the early condensation sites at the subsequent prophase.\r"

As in 2 patients examined previously, amyloid plaques were widespread throughout the cerebrum and the cerebellum, whereas neurofibrillary tangles were numerous in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the substantia innominata. Amyloid plaques were not recognized by polyclonal antibodies against the Alzheimer's disease amyloid A4 protein, but did contain epitopes recognized by antibodies against a prion protein. Spongiform changes were occasionally observed and were mild. Our findings indicate that this familial disorder is a form of or is related to Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease. The consistent presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles may be important in differentiating a distinct subgroup of patients with familial Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, and indicates that a disturbance of the cytoskeleton might be part of the neuronal pathology of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease.\r"

  ".W": "It was recently recommended that all pregnant women undergo prenatal hepatitis B screening. This change from previous policy (which advocated screening of only those individuals with recognized epidemiologic risk factors) is a very costly strategy to use in an effort to prevent the perinatal spread of hepatitis B in the \"no-risk-factor\" population. Inherent problems already exist in screening, related to the following: 1) the failure for disease transmission to occur in the majority of hepatitis B e antigen-negative pregnancies, 2) the lack of established efficacy of prophylaxis in the hepatitis B e antigen-negative pregnancy, 3) the preponderance of hepatitis B e antigen negativity in pregnant hepatitis B surface antigen carriers, and 4) the compliance of the mother to ensure that the prophylaxis program is accomplished. These are further magnified by the lower rates of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen positivity in the population without risk factors. The major expense of a screening program is the hepatitis B surface antigen testing of the mother. The cost to prevent a clinically important case of hepatitis B in the neonates of mothers with no risk factors is $180,000, which is 15 times the cost of preventing a case in neonates of mothers with risk factors. This price appears not to be cost-effective.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a zymogen associated with fibrinolysis, was used in an attempt to prevent scarring and the consequent loss of glaucoma filtration blebs. Bilateral trephine filter procedures were performed in 10 new Zealand white rabbits. In a randomized, masked fashion, one eye received intracameral tPA (25 micrograms), and the fellow placebo, immediately following surgery. One week after surgery, outflow facility in the tPA-treated eyes was significantly greater than that in the control (P less than 0.01). Two weeks after surgery, the outflow facility returned to preoperative levels in all eyes. Eyes receiving tPA had larger blebs than the controls. No increase in postoperative complications, such as hemorrhage or wound leak, was attributable to tPA use. The results suggest that tPA interferes with the wound healing process after surgery and may promote glaucoma filter bleb formation.\r"

Control injections of normal saline caused no decrease in SAF or discharge rate. Lidocaine and tocainide given in incremental doses of 5, 10, 15, 20 and up to 25 mg/kg caused nearly all observed SAFs to stop firing. Mexiletine given in doses of 3, 5, 7, 10 and up to 15 mg/kg showed similar results at lower doses. All agents decreased the sensitivity of SAF to mechanical stimulation. No conduction blockade occurred at these doses of intravenously administered local anesthetics. The demonstrated reduction in firing rate of SAF may explain the pain relief observed in clinical trials of these orally available agents.\r"

A mixed bacterial and viral infection was documented in 19 patients (37%). Seven patients (14%) showed a diagnostic rise in antibodies to H. influenzae and 8 patients (16%) showed an antibody elevation to B. catarrhalis in their paired sera; pneumococcal antigen was detected in acute phase serum from 4 patients (8%). The rate of mixed infections in patients having respiratory symptoms was 52%. High serum C-reactive protein values and white blood cell counts were found significantly more often in those with mixed infections than in those who had viral infections. The results indicate that mixed bacterial and viral infections occur more frequently in children than one could anticipate on the basis of the earlier reports. Mixed bacterial and viral etiology is highly probable in a child who has a defined viral infection with high C-reactive protein and white blood cell count values, especially in the presence of respiratory symptoms.\r"

Factors influencing beta-lactamase production, alterations of target-protein structure or production and decreases in bacterial outer membrane permeability have been identified as the three general mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Because there is no DNA interaction by beta-lactam agents, emergence of resistance results from either spontaneous mutation or the presence of resistant subpopulations; the presence of antibiotics allows for overgrowth of resistant strains. Studies have indicated that there is a significant relationship between the rate of emerging resistance and the ratio of the minimum inhibitory concentration of a beta-lactam to the drug concentration used to select for resistance in vitro or achieved at the infection site in vivo. It is concluded that the use of synergistic combinations of agents should reduce the emergence of beta-lactam-resistant bacterial strains. Thus the choice of an appropriate therapeutic agent requires thorough evaluation of the specific pathogen for susceptibility to a variety of beta-lactam agents and aminoglycosides.\r"

Immunoblotting of human platelet membranes with these antibodies identified a variety of endogenous G proteins including Gs (stimulatory), Gi2 (inhibitory), Gi3, and Gx(z) (unknown function). Pretreatment of platelet membranes with C-terminal antibodies reactive with Gi2, but not with antibodies to Gi3 or Gx(z), blocked alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. This identifies Gi2 as the dominant mediator of cyclase inhibition in this pathway. This approach may provide a general means of identifying relevant functional interactions of G proteins with receptors and effectors in situ.\r"

  ".W": "Immobilized beta gamma subunits of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) were used to isolate alpha subunits from solubilized membranes of bovine tissues and to separate specific alpha subunits based on their differential affinities for beta gamma subunits. The beta gamma subunits were cross-linked to omega-aminobutyl agarose. Up to 7 nmol of alpha subunit could bind to each milliliter of beta gamma-agarose and be recovered by elution with AIF4-. This affinity resin effectively separated the alpha subunits of Gi1 and Gi2 from \"contaminating\" alpha subunits of Go, the most abundant G protein in bovine brain, by taking advantage of the apparent lower affinity of the alpha subunits of Go for beta gamma subunits. The beta gamma-agarose was also used to isolate mixtures of alpha subunits from cholate extracts of membranes from different bovine tissues. alpha subunits of 39-41 kDa (in various ratios) as well as the alpha subunits of Gs were purified. The yields from extracts exceeded 60% for all alpha subunits examined and apparently represented the relative content of alpha subunits in the tissues. This technique can rapidly isolate and identify, from a small amount of sample, the endogenous G proteins in various tissues and cells. So far, only polypeptides in the range of 39-52 kDa have been detected with this approach. If other GTP-binding proteins interact with these beta gamma subunits, the interaction is either of low affinity or mechanistically unique from the alpha subunits isolated in this study.\r"

  ".U": "90046688\r", 
  ".W": "Site-directed mutants of cytochrome P-450cam (the cytochrome P-450 that acts as the terminal monooxygenase in the d-camphor monooxygenase system), in which threonine-252 had been changed to alanine, valine, or serine, were employed to study the role of the hydroxy amino acid in the monooxygenase reaction. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified by a conventional method. All the mutant enzymes in the presence of d-camphor exhibited optical absorption spectra almost indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme in their ferric, ferrous, oxygenated, and carbon monoxide ferrous forms. In a reconstituted system with putidaredoxin and its reductase, the alanine enzyme consumed O2 at a rate (1100 per min per heme) comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (1330 per min per heme), whereas the amount of exo-5-hydroxycamphor formed was less than 10% of that formed by the wild-type enzyme. About 85% of the O2 consumed was recovered as H2O2. The valine enzyme also exhibited an oxidase activity to yield H2O2 accompanied by a relative decrease in the monooxygenase activity. On the other hand, the serine enzyme exhibited essentially the same monooxygenase activity as that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, uncoupling of O2 consumption from the monooxygenase function was produced by the substitution of an amino acid without a hydroxyl group. When binding of O2 to the ferrous forms was examined, the alanine and valine enzymes formed instantaneously an oxygenated form, which slowly decomposed to the ferric form with rates of 5.5 and 3.2 x 10(-3) sec-1 for the former and latter enzymes, respectively. Since these rates were too slow to account for the overall rates of O2 consumption, the formation of H2O2 was considered to proceed not by way of this route but through the decomposition of a peroxide complex formed by reduction of the oxygenated form by reduced putidaredoxin. Based on these findings, a possible mechanism for oxygen activation in this monooxygenase reaction has been discussed.\r"

We have constructed cell lines that constitutively express the HIV-1 Tat protein. Analyses of nuclear proteins from these cells and from matched control cells that do not express Tat have identified three proteins that bind to a radiolabeled HIV-1 TAR RNA probe. These polypeptides are 100 kDa, 62 kDa, and 46 kDa in size. Competition experiments using a wild-type TAR RNA sequence, a biologically inactive mutant sequence of TAR, and an unrelated RNA species demonstrated that these proteins show higher binding affinity to wild-type TAR than to the other two non-trans-activatable sequences. We hypothesize that these cellular proteins may mediate a function necessary in Tat-dependent activation of the LTR. The fact that no differences were seen in the binding profiles of nuclear proteins to TAR RNA in Tat-producing and Tat-nonproducing cells suggests that Tat does not directly interact with TAR.\r"

In skeletal muscle and erythrocyte ghosts from rat, as well as from humans, increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity in ethanol-consuming individuals was not accompanied by an increase in the number of ouabain binding sites. In studies with intact human erythrocytes, similar ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ and 86Rb+ pumping rates were observed between normal and ethanol-consuming individuals and the Na+ to Rb+ pumping ratio was found to be 1.5 in all cases. However, ouabain-sensitive lactate plus Pi formation was increased in cells from alcoholic individuals. Thus these data suggest that increased enzyme activity may be due to a kinetic alteration of the Na+,K+-ATPase and that the enzyme may be less efficient in coupling ion pumping to ATP hydrolysis than the enzyme in normal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs), which links cell-surface receptors to second-messenger effector systems, is assumed to be confined to plasma membranes. In the current studies we tested whether Gs redistributes within cells by treating S49 lymphoma cells with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, then separating cytosol and crude membrane fractions (defined as pellet and supernatant, respectively, after centrifugation for 1 hr at 150,000 x g), and assaying fractions for the alpha subunit of Gs (alpha s) using a competitive ELISA and reconstitution techniques. Under basal conditions, a small (10%) pool of alpha s was identified in supernatant fractions of S49 cells. The size of this pool decreased in the first 15 min after agonist treatment of cells. This decrease was blocked by a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist and did not occur in an S49 variant, UNC, which lacks functional interaction between receptors and Gs. The size of the alpha s pool in supernatant fractions increased to almost 50% of total cellular alpha s during a 1-hr incubation of cells with isoproterenol. Before isoproterenol treatment only the competitive ELISA was sensitive enough to detect cytosolic alpha s, whereas at later time points (greater than or equal to 30 min) the presence of alpha s in the cytosol was confirmed by both immunoblotting and by reconstitution of adenylyl cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] in Gs-deficient membranes derived from cyc-S49 cells. In contrast to membrane alpha s, cytosolic alpha s did not require activation (e.g., by AlF4-) in the reconstitution assay to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Use of an antibody that selectively recognizes monomeric dissociated alpha s, but not heterotrimeric alpha s, indicated that cytosolic alpha s is monomeric. These data indicate that alpha s is not exclusively localized to the plasma membrane and that agonist treatment redistributes this protein within target cells.\r"

Treatment of the patient with coenzyme Q10 and succinate resulted in clinical improvement of respiratory function, consistent with the respiratory deficiencies. Restriction enzyme analysis of the muscle mtDNA revealed a 4.9-kilobase deletion in 50% of the mtDNA molecules. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the deletion was present in the patient's muscle but not in her lymphocytes or platelets. Furthermore, the deletion was not present in the muscle or platelets of two sisters. Hence, the mutation probably occurred in the patient's somatic cells. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA revealed a 4977-base-pair deletion removing four genes for subunits of complex I, one gene for complex IV, two genes for complex V, and five genes for tRNAs, which paralleled the respiratory enzymes affected in the disease. A 13-base-pair direct repeat was observed upstream from both breakpoints. Relative to the direction of heavy-strand replication, the first repeat was retained and the second repeat was deleted, suggesting a slip-replication mechanism. Sequence analysis of the human mtDNA revealed many direct repeats of 10 base pairs or greater, indicating that this mechanism could account for other reported deletions. We postulate that the prevalence of direct repeats in the mtDNA is a consequence of the guanine-cytosine bias of the heavy and light strands.\r"

As a target for mutagenesis, the selectable bacterial lacZ gene was cloned in the vector. The integrated vectors were rescued from total genomic DNA with high efficiency by in vitro packaging and propagation of the phages in a LacZ- strain of Escherichia coli C. The background mutation frequencies in brain and liver DNA appeared to be low, as was indicated by the absence of colorless plaques among 138,816 and 168,160 phage isolated from brain and liver DNA, respectively. Treatment of adult female transgenic mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the frequency of mutated vectors isolated from brain DNA, up to 7.4 x 10(-5) at 250 mg of the alkylating agent per kilogram of body weight. At this dose, in liver DNA of the same mice, mutation frequencies were approximately 3 x 10(-5). DNA sequence analysis of four mutant vectors isolated from brain DNA indicated predominantly G.C----A.T transitions. These results demonstrate the value of this transgenic mouse model in studying gene mutations in vivo. In addition to its use in fundamental research, the system could be used as a sensitive, organ-specific, short-term mutagenicity assay.\r"

The latter was shown by increases in (i) ouabain-inhibitable 86Rb uptake in intact cells, (ii) ouabain-inhibitable ATPase activity in mixed membrane vesicles, and (iii) number of ouabain-binding sites and by similar Kd values for ouabain binding and K1/2 for ouabain inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase as compared to the wild type. The increase in abundance of the Na+ pump is associated with a 4-fold increase in abundance of the mRNA for the alpha 1 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase. We could not detect mRNA for alpha 2 or alpha 3 or for the beta subunits. The increase in abundance of the A system and Na+,K+-ATPase is associated with a negligible increase in intracellular Na+ concentration. We propose that the increase in the abundance of the A system and the Na+,K+-ATPase is the result of a mutation in regulatory gene R1 that controls the A system and the Na+,K+-ATPase and is not due to a primary effect of a possible initial increase in Na+ concentration.\r"

In individual cDNA clones the C region sequences were associated with independent heavy-chain variable region (VH) sequences that were classifiable into five distinct families. Genomic Southern blotting analyses with family-specific probes indicated that the haploid genome contains a minimum of 80 VH gene segments, a number similar to that found in various mammalian species. Multiple JH and putative DH segments were also identified (J, joining; D, diversity). Analyses of 13 independent VHDJH junctions suggest that combinatorial and junctional diversification mechanisms probably arose early in vertebrate evolution. Finally, comparison of Xenopus VH sequences to those from other vertebrates indicated conservation of V region framework residues that are responsible for the tertiary structure of the Fv throughout evolution.\r"

Both immunodeficiencies are characterized by arrests in B-cell differentiation that vary in the extent of the immunoglobulin isotypes involved. A high frequency of major histocompatibility complex supratypes associated with a null allele of the gene encoding the C4A isotype of complement component C4 has been observed in IgA-deficient individuals. In search of a genetic linkage between the two immunodeficiencies, we examined the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III genes encoding complement components C2, C4A, and C4B and steroid 21-hydroxylase in addition to the HLA serotypes in individuals with either common variable immunodeficiency or IgA deficiency. Twelve of 19 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (63%, P less than 0.001) and 9 of 16 patients with IgA deficiency (56%, P less than 0.01) had rare C2 alleles and/or C4A and 21-hydroxylase A deletions, whereas these gene features were seen in only 5 of 34 healthy individuals (15%) in the control group. Nine of 11 patients with C4A deletion had an HLA haplotype consistent with the MHC supratype HLA-A1, Cw7, B8, C4AQ0, C4B1, BfS, DR3 previously found to be associated with IgA deficiency. The data support the hypothesis that common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency are related disorders, susceptibility to which is determined by a gene(s) within or near the MHC class III gene region on chromosome 6.\r"

By flow-cytometric analyses, we have shown that a small, but significant, portion (about 4%) of transgenic spleen cells expresses human mu (transgene) and mouse gamma (endogenous) chains when cultured in vitro with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin 4. By using amplification of cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction, followed by cloning and sequencing of the amplified cDNA fragment, we have demonstrated expression of trans-mRNA consisting of the transgenic variable and endogenous constant (gamma 1) region sequences. Such trans-mRNA could be produced by either switch recombination or trans-splicing between the transgene and endogenous sterile gamma 1-gene transcripts. These results indicate that trans-splicing might be a possible mechanism for the immunoglobulin double-isotype expression in normal B lymphocytes that have not rearranged the second expressed constant region gene.\r"

  ".W": "Applaggin (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus platelet aggregation inhibitor) is a potent inhibitor of platelet activation. The protein is isolated from the venom of the North American water moccasin snake in three steps, including gel filtration, cation exchange, and reverse-phase HPLC procedures. The purified protein migrates as a 17,700-Da polypeptide by SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions and as a 9800-Da peptide in the presence of thiol. The behavior of applaggin on SDS/PAGE would indicate that the protein is a disulfide-linked dimer. Applaggin has been completely sequenced by Edman degradation and consists of 71 amino acids. The sequence is rich in cysteine and contains Arg-Gly-Asp at residues 50-52. Applaggin blocks platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, thrombin, or arachidonic acid with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 128 nM (0.2-2.3 micrograms/ml) depending on the agonist and its concentration. This inhibition is found to correlate with inhibition of thromboxane A2 generation and of dense granule release of serotonin. Inhibition by applaggin of serotonin release induced by ADP, gamma-thrombin, and collagen was monitored in plasma under stirred conditions with [3H]serotonin-loaded platelets, and IC50 values for inhibition are found to range from less than 10 to 145 nM. At saturating concentrations, 125I-labeled applaggin (125I-applaggin) binds to 28,500 sites per unstimulated, washed platelet with a Kd of 1.22 x 10(-7) M. Binding of 125I-applaggin to platelets is inhibited by the synthetic undecapeptide Arg8-Gly-Asp-Val at 200 microM.\r"

To achieve a maximum zone of induration and cell emigration a preparatory dose of the lymphokine was required. A second group of three injections, given 3-4 days after the initial series, resulted in lesser degrees of induration and was more in keeping with a partial local hyporesponsive state. A marked emigration of T cells and monocytes into the dermis resulted from injections of interferon gamma and persisted for greater than 21 days. A preponderance of CD4+ cells in the infiltrate was seen within a few days and CD4/CD8 ratios remained elevated for greater than 5 weeks. The bacillary load of injected sites evaluated 21 days after lymphokine administration was reduced in 14/17 patients by factors ranging from 5- to 1000-fold. This occurred predominantly within diffuse lesions and occurred rarely in nodular sites. Biopsy samples of injected sites taken 6 months later demonstrated progressive 10-fold reductions in bacilli and the continued presence of a granulomatous response.\r"

Injection of the three antisense oligonucleotides into Xenopus oocytes specifically inhibited the expression of glycine receptors by adult spinal cord mRNA. In contrast, the antisense oligonucleotides were much less potent in inhibiting the expression of glycine receptors encoded by neonatal spinal cord mRNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that the oligonucleotides hybridized mostly to an adult cord transcript of approximately 10 kilobases in size. This band was also present in neonatal spinal cord mRNA but its density was about one-fourth of the adult cord message. There was no intense band in the low molecular weight position (approximately 2 kilobases), the existence of which was expected from electrophysiological studies with size-fractionated mRNA of neonatal spinal cord. Our results suggest that in the rat spinal cord there are at least three different types of mRNAs encoding functional strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors.\r"

Synapsin I, a prominent nerve terminal phosphoprotein, interacts with the cytoplasmic surface of small synaptic vesicles and with cytoskeletal elements in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In the present study we have found that depolarization of synaptosomes resulted in a rapid (2-5 sec) translocation of synapsin I from the particulate to the cytosolic (soluble) fraction. This translocation of synapsin I correlated with its phosphorylation state and was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of soluble synapsin I was considerably higher than that of synapsin I in the particulate fraction, under both basal and depolarizing conditions. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in situ, the phosphorylation of synapsin I promotes its translocation from synaptic vesicles/cytoskeleton to the cytosol. This phosphorylation/translocation may be instrumental in regulating the release of neurotransmitter.\r"

A major reason for this discrepancy has been the lack of simple, reliable means of measuring response to airborne chemicals. This paper describes a jump response elicited by exposing Drosophila to chemical vapors. This behavior provides the basis for a single-fly chemosensory assay. The behavior exhibits dose dependence and chemical specificity: it is stimulated by exposure to ethyl acetate, benzaldehyde, and propionic acid but not ethanol. Animals can respond repeatedly at short intervals to ethyl acetate and propionic acid. The response relies on the third antennal segments. To illustrate the use of this behavior in genetic analysis of chemosensory response, nine acj mutants defective in response are isolated (acj = abnormal chemosensory jump), and their responses to two chemicals are characterized. All of the acj mutants are normal in giant fiber system physiology, and two exhibit defects in visual system physiology.\r"

These cDNAs are derived from a single gene (ratPDE3). The deduced amino acid sequence of the ratPDE3 cDNA corresponds to a 66,200-Da protein homologous to other testicular PDEs, to the Drosophila melanogaster dunce-encoded cAMP PDE, and to bovine and yeast PDEs. Expression of ratPDE3 in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells leads to the appearance of a cAMP PDE with properties identical to the cAMP PDE purified from Sertoli cells. Although of different size, transcripts corresponding to ratPDE3 were present in all organs studied. In the immature Sertoli cell in culture, the level of mRNA transcripts of ratPDE3 was increased more than 100-fold by follicle-stimulating hormone or N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate treatment. Stimulation of ratPDE3 mRNA by N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was also observed in a C6 glioma cell line. These data demonstrate that cAMP regulates the expression of one of its own degrading enzymes by an intracellular feedback mechanism that involves changes in mRNA levels.\r"

The 92-kDa type IV procollagenase purified from these cells exists in a noncovalent complex with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases, TIMP. Here we report that the 72-kDa type IV procollagenase purified from HRAS-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells, SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts, and normal skin fibroblasts exists in a stable but noncovalent stoichiometric complex with a 24-kDa inhibitor referred to here as \"TIMP-2.\" TIMP-2 is closely related to TIMP, as demonstrated by comparison of the partial amino acid sequence of this protein to that of TIMP, although it does not cross-react with TIMP-specific antibody. The TIMP-2 inhibitor interacts with the 72-kDa type IV collagenase in preference to the 92-kDa type IV collagenase that forms a complex exclusively with TIMP. The 72-kDa type IV collagenase-TIMP-2 complex can be activated with organomercurials to yield a catalytically competent enzyme. Activation occurs concomitantly with autoproteolytic cleavage of the amino terminus of the protein and does not require dissociation of the complex. Both activity and activation of the complex can be completely inhibited by further addition of stoichiometric quantities of purified TIMP-2 or recombinant TIMP.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a genetic approach to isolate cloned cDNA sequences that determine expression of cell surface oligosaccharide structures and their cognate glycosyltransferases. A cDNA library was constructed in a mammalian expression vector by using mRNA from a murine cell line known to express a UDPgalactose:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase [(alpha 1-3)GT; EC 2.4.1.151]. This library was transfected into COS-1 cells, which lack expression of (alpha 1-3)GT. Transfected cells containing functional (alpha 1-3)GT cDNAs were detected and isolated with a lectin that recognizes the surface-expressed glycoconjugate product of the (alpha 1-3)GT enzyme. One cloned (alpha 1-3)GT cDNA was rescued from lectin-positive transfected cells. This cDNA contains a single long open reading frame that predicts a 394-amino-acid protein. No significant primary structure similarities were identified between this protein and other known sequences. However, the protein predicts a type II transmembrane topology similar to two other mammalian glycosyltransferases. This topology places the large COOH-terminal domain within the Golgi lumen; this domain was shown to be catalytically active when expressed in COS-1 cells as a portion of a secreted protein A fusion peptide. Biochemical analysis confirmed that this enzyme catalyzes a transglycosylation reaction between UDP-Gal and Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc to form Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc. This cloning approach may be generally applicable to the isolation of cDNAs encoding other mammalian glycosyltransferases.\r"

  ".W": "Structural studies on a congenital abnormal coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), factor XII Washington D.C., have been performed to identify the defect responsible for its lack of procoagulant activity. Amino acid sequence analysis of a tryptic peptide isolated from the abnormal factor XII indicated that Cys-571 (equivalent to Cys-220 in the chymotrypsin numbering system) had been replaced by serine. No other substitutions in the active-site triad--namely, His-393, Asp-442, and Ser-544--were found. We propose that the Cys-571----Ser replacement found in this factor XII variant destroys the formation of the disulfide linkage between Cys-540 and Cys-571, giving rise to an altered conformation of the active-site serine residue or the secondary substrate-binding site and, thus, leads to the loss of enzyme activity.\r"

  ".W": "DNA modified by the antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP or cisplatin) was used to identify a factor in mammalian cells that binds to cis-DDP-damaged DNA and hence may play a role in repair. This factor selectively recognizes double-stranded DNA fragments modified by cis-DDP or [Pt(en)Cl2] (en, ethylenediamine). Little or no binding occurs to unmodified double-stranded DNA or to DNA modified with the clinically ineffective compounds trans-DDP and [Pt(dien)Cl]Cl (dien, diethylenetriamine). Low levels of binding to single-stranded DNA modified by cis-DDP are observed. The apparent molecular mass of the factor in a variety of mammalian cells is approximately 100 kDa, as determined by modified Western blotting. Two recombinant phage have been isolated from a human B-cell lambda gt11 library by using a cis-DDP-modified DNA restriction fragment as a probe. The two clones have insert sizes of 1.88 and 1.44 kilobases and are aligned at their 5' ends. The polypeptides encoded by the recombinant phage exhibit DNA binding properties similar to those of the cellular factor identified in crude extracts prepared from mammalian cells. Northern analysis with one of the clones revealed an mRNA of 2.8 kilobases that is conserved in humans and rodents. The methods used here should be applicable in studies of other damage-specific DNA binding proteins.\r"

We have previously described the recombinant expression of each of the five individual pertussis toxin subunits in Escherichia coli and the production of an enzymatically deficient form of the S1 subunit by site-directed mutagenesis. We now report the in vitro assembly of holotoxin from native pertussis toxin B oligomer and recombinant S1 subunits, the latter purified and refolded from insoluble inclusion bodies. Holotoxin assembled with recombinant S1 of authentic amino acid sequence was indistinguishable from native pertussis toxin in its electrophoretic migration and ability to elicit a cytopathic response in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells; in contrast, holotoxin assembled with the genetically deactivated analog of recombinant S1 displayed greatly diminished cytopathicity. These results verify that the in vitro cytopathic effects of pertussis toxin are the result of the enzymatic activity of the S1 subunit and illustrate the potential for constructing complex quaternary protein structures in vitro from insoluble, unfolded polypeptides derived from expression in recombinant systems.\r"

Nucleoprotein complexes of RecA protein, (dT)25-30, and adenosine 5'-[gamma-S]thio-triphosphate were formed in solution and bound to RecA protein-agarose columns. These \"activated\"-RecA nucleoprotein complexes were retained by strong hydrophobic interactions. Purified LexA protein bound tightly to these activated RecA columns, whereas the LexA protein bound poorly to RecA-agarose alone. Once bound, LexA protein underwent specific proteolysis, and the fragments were released from the complex. The mutant LexA protein, LexA-SA119, which cannot carry out self-cleavage or RecA-mediated cleavage in solution, bound efficiently to the activated RecA column but was not cleaved, indicating that these columns can be used to identify residues involved in RecA-LexA binding. As an example of this use, nucleoprotein complexes were prepared using the RecA430 protein. In vivo the recA430 mutation blocks induction of the SOS response. LexA protein was not efficiently retained on the immobilized RecA430 complexes, suggesting that Gly-204 is required for efficient repressor binding. These results show that activated RecA affinity columns can be used to investigate the binding and cleaving properties of mutationally altered RecA and LexA proteins. Additionally, these activated RecA columns have been used to investigate binding interactions of phage lambda repressor, as well as the UmuC protein, which is required for chemical mutagenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) (alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) gene frequencies and ethanol tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster are known to exhibit long-range latitudinal variations on different continents; this has led to the argument that the clines are adaptive. Accordingly, tropical populations are characterized both by a low frequency of Adh-F and by a low ethanol tolerance. In the urban area of Brazzaville (Congo) under an equatorial African climate, an original genetic structure of local populations has been found: Adh-F frequency varies from 3% to 90% when countryside and brewery populations are compared. This variation is accompanied by an increase of ethanol tolerance (from 6% to 13% alcohol). Such differences, which have remained stable for the past 3 years, were observed between collection sites less than 1 km apart. Two other enzyme loci exhibited a correlated variation with Adh-F--i.e., an increase of the S allele of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) and of the F allele of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49). Such observations suggest very strong selective pressures exerted by environmental ethanol that oppose the gene flow due to adult dispersal between contiguous habitats. A functional relationship between the polymorphisms of the three enzyme loci seems likely, and a metabolic interaction involving NAD and NADP cofactors is proposed.\r"

Analysis of a 1989-base-long gene sequence for mouse immunoglobulin gamma 2a heavy-chain constant region as well as the 19,002-base-long gene sequence for human serum albumin revealed deficiency and overabundance of very similar sets of base trimers and tetramers in the coding and noncoding regions of the same gene, in spite of the fact that noncoding regions were considerably richer in A + T. Inasmuch as this universal rule does not discriminate one strand of DNA double helix from another, two complementary DNA strands of the entire gene maintained nearly perfect symmetry. That is to say, the degrees of excesses, deficiencies of the 64-base trimers remained nearly identical between two complementary strands, and this symmetry was only slightly disturbed in the coding region. It would thus appear that the universal rule as an intrinsic force has been exerting far greater influence than natural selection in the evolution of genes.\r"

  ".W": "The abrB gene of Bacillus subtilis is believed to encode a repressor that controls the expression of genes involved in starvation-induced processes such as sporulation and the production of antibiotics and degradative enzymes. Two such genes, spoVG, a sporulation gene of B. subtilis, and tycA, which encodes tyrocidine synthetase I of the tyrocidine biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus brevis, are negatively regulated by abrB in B. subtilis. To examine the role of abrB in the repression of gene transcription, the AbrB protein was purified and then tested for its ability to bind to spoVG and tycA promoter DNA. In a gel mobility shift experiment, AbrB was found to bind to a DNA fragment containing the sequence from -95 to +61 of spoVG. AbrB protein exhibited reduced affinity for DNA of two mutant forms of the spoVG promoter that had been shown to be insensitive to abrB-dependent repression in vivo. These studies showed that an upstream A + T-rich sequence from -37 to -95 was required for optimal AbrB binding. AbrB protein was also observed to bind to the tycA gene within a region between the transcription start site and the tycA coding sequence as well as to a region containing the putative tycA promoter. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that AbrB represses gene expression through its direct interaction with the transcription initiation regions of genes under its control.\r"

The 2.1-kilobase (kb) cDNA encoded a serine-rich polypeptide of 477 amino acids that was 52% identical to the human protein. Southern and Northern (RNA) blot analyses indicated the presence of a single receptor gene and a single predominant 2.3-kb receptor transcript. Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts, stably transfected with the murine IFN-gamma receptor cDNA, expressed murine IFN-gamma receptors as detected by flow cytometry with either ligand or a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody. Nontransfected cells bound neither ligand nor antibody. Radioligand-binding analysis demonstrated that the transfectants expressed 530,000 murine IFN-gamma receptors per cell and bound murine IFN-gamma with a Ka of 1 x 10(9) M-1. However, despite high-level expression of murine IFN-gamma receptors, the transfected human cells responded only to human and not to murine IFN-gamma as detected by enhancement of major histocompatibility class I antigen expression and induction of antiviral activity. These results thus document the isolation and expression of a full-length murine IFN-gamma receptor cDNA and suggest that additional species-specific components may be necessary to form a biologically active IFN-gamma receptor.\r"

CD4-8- cells usually express the gamma delta T-cell receptor, but here we describe a population of CD4-8- T cells from the peripheral blood that express the alpha beta heterodimer. These cells have different surface antigens than gamma delta+ T cells, expressing CD5 but lacking CD16, and differ in function from gamma delta+ T cells. CD4-8- alpha beta+ cells lack non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytolytic function but can be induced to lyse their target cells after activation of their T-cell receptors. A peculiar characteristic of these cells is their responsiveness to interleukin 3. Since these cells have not altered their phenotype or function over a 12-month period in culture, they appear to be mature T cells. The results indicate that normal human peripheral blood contains two subsets of CD4-8- T cells, expressing either gamma delta or alpha beta receptors, that differ in function, phenotype, and growth control.\r"

Arachidonic acid and its 12-lipoxygenase metabolite, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), have been suggested to act as second messengers mediating presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In the present study it was found that CaM-kinase II, purified from rat brain cortex, was inhibited both by arachidonic acid (IC50 = 24 microM) and by 12-HPETE (IC50 = 0.7 microM). Neither substance inhibited CaM-kinase I or III, protein kinase C, or the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Specific inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation by arachidonic acid was also demonstrated in intact synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from rat forebrain. These results suggest that arachidonate and its metabolites may modulate synaptic function through the inhibition of CaM-kinase II-dependent protein phosphorylation.\r"

However, this replication is limited to a region of about 120-175 kilobases on either side of the origin. This has been confirmed by autoradiographic analysis of the overreplicated region. During the second round of synchronized replication at 30 degrees C, replication in fact appears to resume from the stalled forks on either side of the origin. We propose that in B. subtilis, in addition to a first level of control at the origin, a second level of control exists downstream of the origin in order to limit overreplication of the chromosome. These two controls might normally be tightly coupled. We suggest that the second level of control is exerted through the reversible inhibition of replisome movement at specific regions on either side of the origin.\r"

The cytoplasmic region of DLAR and DPTP, as well as human LCA and LAR, are composed of two tandemly repeated PTPase domains. PTPase activities of immunoprecipitated LCA and LAR were demonstrated by measuring the release of phosphate from a 32P-labeled [Tyr(P)]peptide. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domains of LCA, LAR, DLAR, and DPTP, expressed in Escherichia coli, have PTPase activity.

We report that Zif268 has one of the characteristics of a transcriptional regulator, namely, sequence-specific binding to DNA. Zif268 synthesized in Escherichia coli bound to two sites upstream of the zif268 gene and to sites in the promoter regions of other genes. The nucleotide sequences responsible for binding were defined by DNase I footprinting, by methylation interference experiments, and by use of synthetic oligonucleotides. From these results we derived the following consensus sequence for a Zif268 high-affinity binding site: GCGTGGGGCG.\r"

J., Jackson, S. P. & Beggs, J. (1987) Cell 51, 1019-1026]. The mammalian protein appears as a doublet at approximately 200 kDa, smaller than the 260-kDa yeast protein, and possesses an Sm epitope as determined by immunoblotting. Its association with a snRNP of the Sm class other than U1 or U2 is indicated by its immunoprecipitation by anti-Sm and anti-trimethylguanosine antibodies but not by anti-(U1) or anti-(U2) RNP sera. Gradient fractionation of splicing extracts demonstrates that the 200-kDa protein is a component of the U4/5/6 snRNP complex and of U5 snRNPs. It is also present in affinity-purified spliceosomes.\r"

We have used two types of deletions in the chorion cluster: the first was in vitro generated deletions of the ACE-3 region that were subsequently introduced into the germ line, and the second was deletions induced in vivo within a transposon at a preexisting chromosomal location, thus avoiding the complication of position effects. Some of the lines bearing deletions of either type showed amplification, albeit at drastically reduced levels. These unexpected results indicate that, despite its importance, ACE-3 is not essential for low-level amplification and that cis-acting amplification elements are functionally redundant within the autosomal chorion replicon.\r"

After labeling of these ends by using dideoxynucleotides tagged with distinctive fluorescent dyes, the restriction fragments are analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detection of fluorescent emissions using a commercially available DNA sequencer. The nucleotide-specific fluorescent signatures permit determination of the terminal sequence for each labeled end. The set of labeled fragments, characterized by both size and terminal sequence, constitutes a fingerprint that can be used to compare DNA segments for overlap or relatedness. The inclusion of terminal sequence data dramatically increases the information content of the fingerprint, making comparisons more reliable and efficient than those based upon size alone.\r"

Comparison to the map of a 300-kb region of M. xanthus obtained from clones in Escherichia coli indicates that segments of DNA cloned in YACs are stably maintained in yeast and that their sequences accurately reflect the structure of the Myxococcus genome. The 409 YAC inserts were ordered within 60 map segments (contigs) by aligning their EcoRI restriction maps and by hybridization with 18 gene-specific DNA probes. These 60 map segments may represent the entire Myxococcus genome and could be used to organize its genetic information. This study illustrates the utility of YACs for cloning large segments of DNA and for reliable long-range genomic mapping.\r"

Within 2 hr after morphine sulfate-induced degranulation, endothelial cells lining microvessels adjacent to affected mast cells expressed an activation antigen important for endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. Identical results were obtained when other mast cell secretagogues (anti-IgE, compound 48/80, and calcium ionophore A23187) were used. Induction of this antigen was abrogated by preincubation with cromolyn sodium, an inhibitor of mast cell secretion, and by antiserum to tumor necrosis factor alpha. These findings indicate that degranulation of mast cells activates dermal endothelium through tumor necrosis factor-dependent mechanisms. This event may be critical to the elicitation phase of cutaneous inflammation.\r"

A single guanine----cytosine replacement in the codon for amino acid 340 resulted in a glycine----arginine substitution in the hormone-binding domain of one of two alleles of the patient's thyroid hormone nuclear receptor beta gene. In vitro translation products of this mutant human thyroid hormone nuclear receptor beta gene did not bind triiodothyronine. Thus, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone can result from expression of an abnormal thyroid hormone nuclear receptor molecule.\r"

The mutant polysaccharide is antigenically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of type 14 Streptococcus pneumoniae, as predicted by the structures of the type III group B Streptococcus and S. pneumoniae polysaccharides. Loss of capsular sialic acid was associated with loss of virulence in the mutant strain in a neonatal rat model of lethal group B Streptococcus infection. These studies demonstrate directly that capsular sialic acid is a critical virulence determinant for type III group B Streptococcus and support the general hypothesis that surface sialylation aids pathogenic microorganisms in evading host defenses.\r"

The sequence of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (penA) from a penicillin-resistant strain of N. meningitidis was compared to the sequence of the same gene from penicillin-sensitive strains and from penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The penA genes from penicillin-sensitive strains of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis were 98% identical. The gene from the penicillin-resistant strain of N. meningitidis consisted of regions that were almost identical to the corresponding regions in the penicillin-sensitive strains (less than 0.2% divergence) and two regions that were very different from them (approximately 22% divergence). The two blocks of altered sequence have arisen by the replacement of meningococcal sequences with the corresponding regions from the penA gene of Neisseria flavescens and result in an altered form of penicillin-binding protein 2 that contains 44 amino acid substitutions and 1 amino acid insertion compared to penicillin-binding protein 2 of penicillin-sensitive strains of N. meningitidis. A similar introduction of part of the penA gene of N. flavescens, or a very similar commensal Neisseria species, appears to have occurred independently during the development of altered penA genes in non-beta-lactamase-producing penicillin-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae.\r"

For this application to be feasible, most sequences in complex genomes must be able to be cloned in YAC's, and most clones must be genetically stable and colinear with the genomic sequences from which they originated (that is, not liable to undergo rearrangement). These requirements have been met with a YAC library containing DNA fragments from Drosophila melanogaster ranging in size up to several hundred kilobase pairs. Preliminary characterization of the Drosophila YAC library was carried out by in situ hybridization of random clones and analysis of clones containing known sequences. The results suggest that most euchromatic sequences can be cloned. The library also contains clones in which the inserted DNA is derived from the centromeric heterochromatin. The locations of 58 clones collectively representing about 8 percent of the euchromatic genome are presented.\r"

Antinuclear antibodies and clinical features of a defined connective tissue disease were absent. Treatment with plasmapheresis, prednisone, intravenous cyclophosphamide, and warfarin was accompanied by disappearance from the serum of the lupus anticoagulant and the biologic false-positive test for syphilis; IgG anticardiolipin antibodies persisted, however, and the patient had a second cerebral thrombosis. Clinical improvement ultimately occurred after the dosage of cyclophosphamide was optimized and the level of IgG anticardiolipin antibody decreased to a level lower than any that has been previously associated with thrombotic complications.\r"

  ".U": "90049742\r", 
  ".W": "Recently a relationship has been postulated between lowered intracellular glutamine concentrations in the skeletal muscle and the rate of protein synthesis. We investigated the effect of 48 hours of parenteral nutrition supplemented with a solution containing glutamine in free or dipeptide form (alanylglutamine or glycylglutamine) on the intracellular glutamine pool in skeletal muscle and on the hind limb exchange of glutamine in dogs with sepsis after surgery. Before surgery, dogs were fasted for 48 hours. We used glutamine dipeptides as sources because they remain stable in an aqueous solution. Nutrition solutions were isocaloric (17.8 kcal/kg body weight/day on day 1 and 35.6 kcal/kg on day 2) and isonitrogenous (0.33 gm nitrogen/kg body weight/day), providing 2.6 mmol/kg body weight/day as glutamine source. During starvation, muscular free glutamine levels decreased by 41% to 10.4 mmol/L (p less than 0.001). On the second postoperative day the dogs had lowered plasma protein levels, a sharp drop in platelet count, an increase in the leukocyte count, and positive blood cultures. None of the solutions investigated in this study was effective in repleting the glutamine pool during 2 days of postoperative nutrition (11 +/- 2.0 mmol/L without glutamine, 10.3 +/- 2.2 mmol/L with glutamine plus alanine, 9.9 +/- 1.6 mmol/L with alanylglutamine, 7.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/L with glutamine plus glycine, and 7.2 +/- 1.2 mmol/L with glycylglutamine, respectively). The release of glutamine from the hindquarter was 631 +/- 38 nmol/kg body weight/min in the control group and decreased significantly in dogs receiving alanylglutamine (13.5 +/- 45 nmol/kg body weight/min; p less than 0.001) or the constituent amino acids (265 +/- 66 nmol/kg body weight/min; p less than 0.01) but was unchanged in dogs receiving glycylglutamine or glutamine plus glycine. We conclude that the duration and dosage of glutamine administration (equivalent to 26 gm glutamine per day in a patient weighing 70 kg) used in this study are not sufficient to restore glutamine deficiency of the skeletal muscle in the depleted state.\r"

Of the 492 patients with cerebrovascular disease or ischemic heart disease who entered the study, 354 had hematologic studies, including platelet aggregation in 230. Abnormal angiograms were associated with greater age, treated hypertension, current smoking, and lower hemoglobin levels but with higher uric acid, factor VIII, and fibrinogen concentrations. In patients presenting with isolated transient ischemic attacks, abnormal angiograms were also associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. To study atheroma progression, the 230 patients with complete data at entry were recalled 2 years later. Repeat angiography in 209 patients showed progression of visible bifurcation disease in 13.4%. There was some evidence that progression was linked to higher age, hypertension, and more severe disease at entry, but further analysis was hampered by the small number of patients showing increased plaque size. The possible role of risk factors and hemostatic variables, especially fibrinogen, is discussed. Factors that did not correlate with progression of angiographically visible disease may also influence clinical end points by other mechanisms, such as thrombogenesis.\r"

To ascertain the relative cost to benefit of intervention, we evaluated 78 matched pairs of acute myocardial infarction patients from a prospective data base of 507 consecutive patients presenting with infarction from May 1986 to July 1987. The pairs were matched for age (mean 61 years), sex (68% male), and infarct location (43% anterior). Intervention (thrombolytics and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]) was only applied to patients at less than 6 hours from symptom onset. Nonintervention patients were subsequently considered for angiography and revascularization (PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) based on clinical criteria. Clinical outcome was evaluated by in-hospital mortality and uncomplicated status (free of angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias) at 72 hours. Intervention was associated with decreased mortality (5.3% versus 13%, p = 0.16) and increased uncomplicated course (43% versus 19%, p less than 0.001) as compared with patients not receiving intervention. Hospital procedures for the intervention and nonintervention group were as follows: diagnostic cardiac catheterization (99% versus 51%); PTCA (60% versus 0%); and CABG (14% versus 19%), respectively. The mean cumulative hospital and professional charges were $31,684 for the intervention group and $29,022 for the nonintervention group (p = 0.50). In conclusion, despite the potential marked incremental expense of technology associated with intervention for acute myocardial infarction, this analysis demonstrates that benefit in clinical outcome can be derived without substantially increased costs.\r"

Seventeen patients with acute myocardial infarction but without clinical evidence of congestive heart failure had their circulating concentration of ANF and creatine phosphokinase monitored daily for 14 days. All 17 patients had an elevated plasma ANF concentration at time of presentation. Maximal increase in ANF was on day 2 and 3 post-infarction. This maximal increase correlated with the size of infarction estimated by the maximal creatine phosphokinase concentration (r = 0.475; p less than 0.05), but did not correlate with the amount of left ventricular dysfunction. ANF began to decrease by day 4 post-infarction and was normal at 10 days post-infarction in 14 of the 17 (82%) patients. At 12 days post-infarction, all 17 patients had normal ANF levels. Another three patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The measured ANF levels in these patients were within our normal range and were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than those seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction not given thrombolytic therapy. Six patients with unstable angina likewise had normal circulating ANF concentrations during prolonged episodes of chest pain. These levels were also significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than the 17 patients with acute infarcts not given tPA. The distinct pattern of release of ANF may be useful as an adjunct to serum cardiac enzymes in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary clinical experience with laser angioplasty has suggested that arterial spasm may complicate attempts to employ laser light to accomplish vascular recanalization. The present study was designed to investigate the role of energy profile on the development of arterial spasm during laser angioplasty. Laser irradiation was delivered percutaneously in vivo to New Zealand white rabbits and to Yucatan microswine with or without atherosclerotic lesions induced by a combination of balloon endothelial denudation and atherogenic diet. Continuous wave (CW) laser irradiation from an argon ion gas laser (wavelength 488 to 514 nm) was applied to 23 arteries, while 16 arteries were irradiated using a pulsed xenon chloride (308 nm) or xenon fluoride (351 nm) excimer laser. Arterial spasm, defined as greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter narrowing, complicated delivery of laser light to 17 (74%) of the 23 arteries irradiated with the CW argon laser. Spasm was consistently observed at powers greater than 2 W, at cumulative exposures greater than 200 seconds, and at total energy greater than 200 joules. Spasm was typically diffuse (including the length of the vessel) and protracted (lasting up to 120 minutes). Intra-arterial nitroglycerin (up to 300 micrograms) produced only temporary and incomplete resolution of laser-induced spasm. In contrast, spasm was never observed in any of the 16 arteries in which laser angioplasty was performed using a pulsed laser (0.95 to 6.37 joules/cm2, 10 to 50 Hz, 48 to 370 seconds). Thus CW but not pulsed laser angioplasty may be complicated by arterial spasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endomyocardial biopsies from 174 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) were examined. Eight patients with histologically proven myocarditis were excluded from the study. A peculiar pattern of oversized and bizarre nuclei was observed in only some of the remaining patients. Two groups were identified: those with and without this feature (groups A and B, respectively). Myocyte width, nuclear diameter and nuclear/sarcoplasmic ratio were significantly higher in group A. The mean respective values were 36 +/- 5 mu, 14 +/- 3 mu and 0.41 +/- 0.08 for group A versus 20 +/- 8 mu, 7 +/- 2 mu and 0.37 +/- 0.08 for group B. Interstitial fibrosis was similarly present in groups A and B. Endocardial thickness was significantly increased in all patients, with group A showing the highest mean value. The morphologic features showed no correlation with the clinical condition of the patients at time of presentation. HLA typing was performed in 50 consecutive patients, 38 from group A and 12 from group B. DR4 and DR5 antigens were significantly more frequent in DC patients than in a normal population control (400 blood donors), while DR3 was less frequent. Group A was more strongly associated with the DR5 antigen than group B (55.3 vs 25.0%, respectively). It was less strongly associated with the DR4 antigen compared with group B (21.5 vs 41.7%, respectively). No difference was observed between the 2 groups concerning negative association with the DR3 antigen. Endomyocardial biopsies from DC patients reveal marked morphologic changes from patient to patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether the vasodilatory action of amlodipine is due to inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx through the calcium channel, its effects on KCl-induced contraction of pig coronary artery rings and its interaction with the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site in isolated sarcolemmal membranes were studied. The contractile function of artery rings was studied in an organ bath system, and the interaction with the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site was studied in isolated sarcolemmal membranes of pig coronary artery using [3H](+)PN200-110 as a radioligand. Amlodipine, (+)PN200-110 and (-)PN200-110 inhibited KCl-induced contractions of arterial rings in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was observed at 0.46 +/- 0.02, 36 +/- 8 and 55 +/- 9 nM of (+)PN200-110, (-)PN200-110 and amlodipine, respectively. [3H](+)PN200-110 was found to bind to isolated sarcolemmal membranes with high affinity (KD = 0.04 nM, Bmax = 312 fmoles/mg protein) and stereospecifically, (+)PN200-110 (Ki = 0.05 nM) having about 130-fold higher affinity than (-)PN200-110 (Ki = 6.61 nM). Amlodipine also inhibited [3H](+)PN200-110 binding with high affinity (Ki = 4.41 nM). The inhibition was characterized by an increase in KD of binding of [3H](+)PN200-110 with very little effect on Bmax. The order of relative potency of inhibition of KCl-induced contraction was almost identical to the order of relative affinity for the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site, as indicated by Ki.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bleeding time, serum thromboxane, collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane formation and excretion of thromboxane and prostacyclin metabolites were measured both at peak and trough action of the drug. The inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane formation were significantly less marked with the split dose regimen, intermediate with the single dose of 40 mg aspirin/day and best with the alternate day doubled dose, but still inferior to the effects of 324 mg/day. Thromboxane excretion was suppressed by greater than 80% with all regimens. Prostacyclin metabolite excretion was similar for all 40 mg/day regimens with about 40% suppression at trough and 60% at peak drug action, respectively. Suppression was more pronounced after 324 mg/day. For best platelet inactivation at comparable sparing of prostacyclin formation, low doses of aspirin should be administered in pulsed rather than split regimens.\r"

Retinyl margarinate, which is chemically similar to physiological retinyl esters, was used in vitamin A-depleted rats to study uptake, distribution, and storage of retinyl esters in tissues. Vitamin A-depleted and Vitamin A-sufficient rats were infused with a micellar suspension of retinyl margarinate for 7 h and then killed at different times. Retinyl margarinate was directly taken up by all tissues examined. It appears that infusion of retinyl esters in micellar form provides a direct way to supply vitamin A to peripheral, vitamin A-dependent tissues. Therefore, a short-term infusion of retinyl esters with an emulsifier may be an effective means of preventing development of vitamin A-deficiency during long-term application of TPN, particularly in cases of liver dysfunction.\r"

Long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) patients can inadvertently receive significant amounts of ultratrace elements present as contaminants in TPN solutions. We determined the intake of selected ultratrace elements from a standard TPN solution and compared it with the amount reported to be absorbed from food in normal subjects. Contamination of TPN solutions with ultratrace elements was widespread and variable. The daily intakes of Mo, Ni, V. and Cd from this contamination were comparable to the amounts reported to be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract in normal subjects. Al intake was high; B intake was low, approximately 10% of the amount absorbed by normal subjects. Thus, TPN solutions are contaminated with significant amounts of ultratrace elements. The biological significance of the intravenous infusion of these ultratrace elements is unclear and requires further investigation, particularly in home TPN patients.\r"

Compared with Man, Lac, and GG caused a significant increase in net water and sodium absorption and luminal calcium concentration. In subjects receiving both Lac and GG, water and sodium absorption were greater with GG. The only statistically significant increase in net calcium absorption occurred with Man vs GG in which water absorption increased from 16 to 350 mL.h-1.30 cm-1. However, by use of data from all test solutions, water and sodium absorption were found to be significantly correlated with calcium absorption (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that lactose or its component sugars enhance jejunal calcium absorption in proportion to their effect on fluid absorption.\r"

Each infant had been nourished with lipid emulsions delivered through deep-line catheters. The infections, all discovered at autopsy, were characterized by massive involvement of lungs. Two of the three had endocardial vegetations containing M. furfur; all three had lesions in liver, kidney, and spleen, and two had lesions in adrenal, pancreas, and colon. In addition, one of the infants had acute meningoencephalitis caused by M. furfur. In some of the distant organs, yeast cells of M. furfur were growing in the lumina of small vessels, filling the lumina, but causing no vasculitis or infarction. In addition to these benign collections of yeasts within vessels, there were acute inflammatory lesions as well. These were consolidation, vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, septic thrombosis, and septic infarction of lung and foci of necrosis and inflammation in kidney and liver. Two previously reported autopsies described neonates with lesions in lung and heart. The authors' three cases for which autopsies were performed had lesions in lung and heart too but, in addition, had dissemination with acute lesions in kidney and liver. Finally, one patient had a severe meningoencephalitis caused by M. furfur.\r"

RBCs from 35 of 3,458 random group B donors (1%) reacted with the monoclonal anti-A after immediate centrifugation. Reactivity was associated with high serum levels of B-gene-specified transferase and was caused by the MH04 component, a potent anti-A capable of detecting some examples of Ax RBCs. It is probable that the potency of MH04 permitted detection of low levels of A determinants synthesized by the donors' unusually strong B-gene-specified transferase. Transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine by B-gene-specified transferases, reported in vitro, has not been detected previously in vivo. Use of highly sensitive monoclonal reagents may result in clinically ambiguous blood grouping results.\r"

Peak growth hormone levels (greater than or equal to 10 ng/mL) following oral clonidine administration were normal in individuals with normal height, constitutional growth delay, and neurosecretory dysfunction, as was the basal somatomedin C concentration; subjects with growth hormone deficiency had low peak growth hormone levels (less than 10 ng/mL) following oral clonidine administration as well as low basal somatomedin C values. The mean 9-hour overnight growth hormone concentration, total growth hormone output, total number of nocturnal pulses, and the mean peak growth hormone response during nocturnal sampling were similar in the normal height and constitutional growth delay groups and significantly greater than those seen in subjects with either growth hormone deficiency or neurosecretory dysfunction. Twelve (26.6%) of 45 normally growing children (4 to 10 normal height and 8 of 35 constitutional growth delay), however, had low overnight growth hormone levels (less than 3 ng/mL), which overlapped results obtained in the growth hormone-deficient or neurosecretory dysfunction groups. Frequent overnight growth hormone (GH) sampling does not always separate normal-growing children from those with partial or complete GH deficiency. In our this study over one quarter of the normally growing children had overnight GH levels in the range of children with either GH deficiency or neurosecretory dysfunction. These findings, in addition to the cost and difficulty in performing this test, do not support the measurement of spontaneous GH as a routine test in short but normally growing prepubertal children.\r"

The fasted gallbladder volume before drug administration was 18.9 +/- 1.1 cm3 on the placebo day, and 18.8 +/- 1.4 cm3 on the misoprostol day. No significant change in the gallbladder volume was observed 30 minutes after drug administration (18.3 +/- 1.3 cm3 placebo vs 20.2 +/- 1.8 cm3 misoprostol). The gallbladder volume 10 min after the test meal was significantly larger after misoprostol (16.9 +/- 1.7 cm3) than after placebo (12.8 +/- 1.6 cm3), p less than 0.02. However, the differences at subsequent time points (i.e. 20, 30, and 40 min after the test meal) proved to be insignificant. An insignificant effect of misoprostol on gallbladder emptying was revealed also by the analysis of the respective gallbladder ejection fractions. We conclude that misoprostol does not have any significant effect on fasted gallbladder volume or on meal-induced gallbladder emptying in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Human renal biopsies are currently used to provide information about morphologic changes, chronicity of disease, patterns of inflammation, and immunoglobulin deposition. This practice has provided only limited insight into functional aberrations and has failed to provided information necessary for disease classification based on pathophysiology. To expand the potential of the renal biopsy in this regard and to determine whether differences in glomerular atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) binding exist in different forms of primary renal disease, quantitative autoradiography and 125I-human ANF (1-28) were used to determine the location and pharmacological characteristics of ANF binding sites in the normal human kidney. Specific ANF binding was highest in the glomeruli, but lower levels of specific binding were localized to the inner medulla and the interlobular arteries. ANF binding sites in the human kidney were found to be highly stable and similar in both location and pharmacology to those observed in experimental animals. As determined by saturation experiments, the equilibrium dissociation constants for glomeruli, inner medulla, and interlobular arteries were almost identical at 4.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Competitive binding inhibition studies with unlabeled human ANF (1-28) demonstrated highly specific binding shared by the glomerulus, inner medulla, and interlobular artery, with apparent half-maximal inhibition concentrations of 9.2 x 10(-10) mol/L, 8.0 x -10 mol/L, and 8.2 x 10(-10) mol/L, respectively. Quantitation of specific binding of ANF to glomeruli in needle biopsy specimens of three primary glomerulopathies, ie, minimal-change disease, membranous nephropathy, and focal glomerulosclerosis, showed no differences among the groups. This study demonstrates the feasibility of studying receptor physiology on biopsy specimens of the human kidney and should allow renal diseases, particularly of glomerular origin, to be characterized according to differences in hormone binding and hormone responsiveness. The absence of significant differences in glomerular ANF binding in the primary glomerulopathies studied is consistent with other studies that have failed to delineate important pathophysiological differences in renal function and volume homeostasis in these disease states.\r"

The duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 16 days for OKT3 (mean, 8 days) and 7 to 14 days for MAG (mean, 9 days) as dictated by the postoperative recovery of renal function. All patients were followed-up for at least 3 months (maximum, 18 months; mean, 10 months). Of the 43 patients receiving OKT3, 11 (26%) had rejection episodes that were reversed and did not reoccur. Two patients had episodes that could not be reversed, resulting in graft loss. Of the 67 patients receiving MAG, 38 (57%) experienced a first rejection episode within the follow-up period; 16 of these had repeat rejections. Renal function was significantly better in the OKT3 group. Although both OKT3 and MAG were associated with excellent patient (98%) and graft (92%) survival, OKT3 was easier to administer with fewer rejection episodes. It was concluded that OKT3 is superior to MAG as perioperative cytoreductive therapy following cadaveric kidney transplantation.\r"

The first dose of OKT3 was administered intraoperatively. Patient survival was 100% with a mean follow-up period of 13 months. Graft survival at 1 year was 70% (19 of 27). Eight grafts were lost during the first 6 weeks. Causes of graft loss were hyperacute rejection or primary nonfunction (4), irreversible rejection (2), and technical (2). After the first month, single rejection episodes occurred in four patients and multiple rejection episodes in three patients; all were successfully reversed, and no further graft losses were encountered. Mean serum creatinine level at 1 month posttransplant was 141 mumol/L (1.6 mg/dL), and the average serum creatinine has remained at that level during the follow-up period. No serious infections were encountered. Prophylactic OKT3 administration resulted in depletion of CD3+ lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation throughout therapy, as well as the development of therapeutic serum OKT3 levels. Five of the 27 (22%) patients developed antimurine antibodies during or after OKT3 therapy; four of these patients had low-titer antimurine antibody, and one had high-titer antimurine antibody. First-dose reactions were generally mild in this group of patients. Prophylactic use of OKT3 in this patient population resulted in superior graft survival when compared with a similar group of patients not receiving OKT3.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased 1-year allograft survival rates have frequently been observed in cadaveric renal allograft recipients with postoperative acute tubular necrosis (ATN), even in the cyclosporine era. Use of cyclosporine despite ATN may lead to a prolongation of ATN, while withholding cyclosporine may increase the chance of an early rejection episode. Prophylactic polyclonal antilymphocyte antibodies have been used postoperatively to prevent rejection while avoiding cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Since January 1987, the authors have used OKT3 monoclonal antibody prophylaxis in all cadaver kidney recipients with ATN (n = 26). The posttransplant course of these patients was compared with that of cadaveric kidney recipients with ATN who received transplants in 1985-1986 and were treated with cyclosporine during ATN (n = 40). Allograft survival rates in these patients were also compared with those observed in cadaver kidney recipients with immediate graft function. The 1-year graft survival rate was significantly better in the ATN patients who received OKT3 prophylaxis (83%) than in those who were treated early with cyclosporine during the period of ATN (55%). The mean duration of OKT3 therapy was 11.1 +/- 2.5 days. There was no significant difference in 1-year graft survival rates between the ATN patients treated with OKT3 prophylaxis and patients who had immediate graft function (74%, 1985 through 1988 combined). Patient survival was unaffected by the occurrence of ATN or the postoperative immunosuppressive protocol. The duration of ATN was shortened (9.3 +/- 4.0 v 14.9 +/- 10.2 days), and the median time to first rejection was prolonged (23.5 v 11.0 days) by OKT3 prophylaxis compared with early cyclosporine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Decreasing Medicare reimbursement for renal transplantation has placed a premium on early hospital discharge. On average, the diagnosis-related group reimbursement for renal transplantation is exhausted by the ninth hospital day at the authors' institution. Previously, the median length of hospital stay was 14 days for patients with initial graft dysfunction and 8 days for those with immediate function. In the present protocol, all patients received a single 10-mg dose of OKT3 during the transplant procedure. Those with good initial function received no further OKT3 and began receiving cyclosporine, 10 mg/kg/d, on the second posttransplant day. High-dose cyclosporine was avoided in those with poor initial function, whether they required dialysis or not. Instead, they received cyclosporine, 6 mg/kg/d and resumed OKT3, 5 mg/d, on the second day for up to a 14-day course to prevent rejection during recovery of renal function and permit early discharge. All patients received maintenance immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. Of 39 adult cadaveric-donor renal transplant recipients entered in the protocol with 2 to 8 months follow-up, 13 (33%) had good graft function and received only the intraoperative dose of OKT3, 9 (23%) had poor initial function but did not require dialysis, and 17 (44%) had poor function receiving dialysis for a median duration of 15 days (range, 2-46 days). Side effects of OKT3 were well tolerated, and median hospital stays were 7 days (range, 6-11), 7 days (range, 5-14), and 9 days (range, 5-15), respectively, for the three groups. Overall patient survival was 100% and graft survival was 97% for the short follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients were retreated once and two patients were retreated two times with OKT3 after previous rejection or induction therapy in cadaveric renal transplantation. Retreatment was effective when the initial treatment was for rejection therapy or induction therapy protocols. Rejection reversal was 83% in the rejection group and 90% in the induction group. Long-term allograft function was 42% in the rejection group and 78% in the induction group. It is speculated that the immune response is more adequately controlled in the induction group. The antibody responses to retreatment were no antibody production (n = 9), antibody production on retreatment (n = 2), no change in antibody titer (n = 4), and increase in previously identified antibody titer (n = 3). Two patients with high titered antibodies had treatment failures caused by preformed antimouse antibodies. The only changes in antibody specificity occurred in patients with a change in preformed antibody. Retreatment of allograft rejection in patients previously treated with OKT3 has again been demonstrated to be effective. It is suggested that retreatment after OKT3 induction therapy may be the most effective.\r"

Unfortunately, a variety of adverse reactions are observed following the first and second doses of OKT3. In a series of experiments designed to examine the signaling repertoire of OKT3, it was found that (1) OKT3 is an effective substitute for the alloantigen stimulus in the activation of antigen-specific memory T cells; (2) OKT3 is a potent inducer of cytolytic activity (secondary cytotoxic T-cell activity as well as natural killer-cell activity); (3) OKT3 is also an inducer of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma production; and (4) of the immunosuppressants currently in clinical use, cyclosporine greater than methylprednisolone greater than 6-mercaptopurine (an in vivo cleavage product of azathioprine) in curtailing T-cell activation with OKT3. Collectively, these observations suggest a potential mechanistic basis for the adverse reactions associated with OKT3 and provide experimental support for therapeutic strategies that include the use of cyclosporine and/or methylprednisolone before OKT3 administration.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a collaborative study, Orthoclone OKT3 (Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, Raritan, NJ) monoclonal anti-T-cell antibody was used prophylactically for 14 days following cadaveric renal transplantation. Patients were randomized before treatment and compared with a control group treated with triple-drug immunosuppressant therapy consisting of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. The OKT3 group (also treated with prednisone and azathioprine) had significantly fewer patients with acute rejection during the first year (27% v 60%), significantly delayed onset of acute rejection (median number of days to rejection, 56 v 10), and shortened duration of delayed initial graft function (median number of days on nonfunction, 5.5 v 9.0). OKT3 was safely administered intraoperatively. The study group included diabetics and patients over the age of 50 years. There was an increased incidence of benign fungal infection in patients treated with OKT3. The outcome data of both the prophylactic and control groups in this single-center trial was different from the multicenter experience in that patient and graft survival was 100% in both groups. The only difference in the immunosuppressive protocol was the use of 2 g intravenous methylprednisolone intraoperatively. The combination of intraoperative OKT3 with 2 g methylprednisolone may merit further study. It was concluded that OKT3 prophylaxis reduces the incidence of rejection episodes, delays the occurrence of rejection, and may reduce the duration of delayed initial graft function. It is not associated with an increase in serious infection and can be administered safely to a variety of cadaver transplant recipients.\r"

Multilocus data for a total of 17 informative NF1 families and 39 other families were included in genetic analyses. No recombination was observed between NF1 and four markers, one or more of which was informative in 86% of parents. More-refined physical mapping studies demonstrated that all four of the markers are proximal to the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints from two NF1 patients bearing balanced translocations. The region flanking the disease locus spans a distance of 1 centimorgan (cM) in males and 9 cM in females. Close flanking markers were informative in 76% of meioses. Sex differences in recombination rates in the pericentric region were highly significant statistically.\r"

We demonstrate here the magnitude of DNA content differences among normal chromosomes of the same type. Significant peak-position differences between homologues were observed for an average of four chromosome types in each of the karyotypes of 98 different individuals. The frequency of individuals with differences in homologue peak positions varied among chromosome types: e.g., chromosome 15, 61%; chromosome 3, 4%. Flow karyotypes of 33 unrelated individuals were compared to determine the range of peak position among normal chromosomes. Chromosomes Y, 21, 22, 15, 16, 13, 14, and 19 were most heteromorphic, and chromosomes 2-8 and X were least heteromorphic. The largest chromosome 21 was 45% larger than the smallest 21 chromosome observed. The base composition of the variable regions differed among chromosome types. DNA contents of chromosome variants determined from flow karyotypes were closely correlated to measurements of DNA content made of gallocyanin chrome alum-stained metaphase chromosomes on slides. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific repetitive sequences indicated that variability in their copy number is partly responsible for peak-position variability in some chromosomes. Heteromorphic chromosomes are identified for which parental flow karyotype information will be essential if de novo rearrangements resulting in small DNA content changes are to be detected with flow karyotyping.\r"

We observed instances of arterial thrombosis in two studies of breast cancer involving multiagent chemotherapy for stages II and III disease. Our purpose in this study was to determine the incidence of this complication and whether it appeared to be related to the chemotherapy or was a random event. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Episodes of arterial thrombotic events were identified from record reviews of 1,014 assessable patients with breast cancer entered on two Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols. Details of the kind of arterial event, when it occurred, the outcome, and the occurrence of metastases were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen (1.3%) patients had an arterial thrombosis: six (5.3%) of 113 patients with stage III disease and seven (0.8%) of 901 patients with stage II disease. Four of these patients had a peripheral arterial thrombosis and nine had strokes (four were fatal). All these events occurred while the patients were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Only one additional arterial event (a stroke approximately four years later) has occurred in this patient group after chemotherapy was completed. CONCLUSION: Arterial thrombosis is also associated with multiagent chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The mechanism is unknown.\r"

To determine the impact of PPS on nursing homes, the authors studied the activity of a Veterans Administration teaching nursing home (admissions, acute hospital transfers, and discharges) during 1 year preceding implementation of DRGs and for 3 consecutive years following implementation of DRGs. In 1983, pre-DRGs, a total of 36 patients, were admitted to the nursing home. Following implementation of DRGs, a sevenfold increase was noted in the number of patients admitted when comparing 1983 and 1986, with the monthly average of patients admitted increasing from 3 in 1983 to 9.7, 22, and 23.8 in 1984, 1985, and 1986, respectively. Associated with the increase in patients admitted following DRGs was an increase in patients requiring transfer to the acute hospital, within 30 days of admission to the nursing home. In 1986, approximately 27% of patients admitted to the nursing home required transfer to the acute hospital within 30 days of their admission. The number of patients discharged from the nursing home also increased following DRGs. None of the patients admitted to the nursing home in 1983 were discharged within 30 days of admission. Subsequent to introduction of DRGs, an average of two patients per month were discharged within 30 days of nursing home admission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its severity of expression in homozygotes varies widely, and the disease involves multiple organ systems. During the past few years, major advances in CF research have been made. These advances have occurred primarily in the fields of physiology and molecular genetics. As a result of these advances, it is now generally accepted that the basic defect in CF is the inability of an epithelial chloride channel to respond to adrenergic stimulation in affected organs. The recent major breakthrough in CF research is the localization of the CF gene and identification of the mutation responsible for the majority of cases of CF. In this article, the evidence which has led to this conclusion, as well as possible mechanisms by which a mutation in a single codon can produce the CF defects are reviewed. Finally, new approaches to the characterization of the CF gene by complementation of the defect in immortal cell lines displaying the transport phenotype associated with CF are discussed.\r"

Immunologic markers specific to these two tissue origins were tested on cryostat sections from three primary tumors carrying the chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12). Cell lines established in vitro from two of these three primary tumors were also analyzed. Using antibodies directed against neural components (neurone-specific-enolase [NSE], HNK-1, and neurofilament triplet proteins [NFTP]), positive reactions were observed in cells from two primary tumors and their corresponding cell lines. Results of electron microscopic examination of the primary tumors were compatible with the diagnosis of ES. When using antibodies directed against mesenchymal cell surface antigens (common leucocytes, Leu M1, Leu M2, and Leu M3), the weak positive reactions observed in the three primary tumors were attributed to lymphoid infiltrates within tumor cells. Six additional ES cell lines carrying the translocation t(11;22) were also analyzed by immunocytochemical and flow cytometry methods using antibodies directed against mesenchymal and neural components. Positive reactions were observed in all seven cell lines tested using antibodies directed against NSE, HNK-1, and 200 KD subunit of the NFTP, whereas negative reactions were obtained with Leu M2 antibody. These results are consistent with a neuroectodermal origin of ES cells.\r"

  ".W": "The morphology and function of cytoplasmic lipid bodies in human neutrophils were evaluated. By transmission electron microscopy, neutrophil lipid bodies were cytoplasmic inclusions, usually several microns in diameter, that occasionally coalesced to attain a diameter up to 7 microM. Neutrophil lipid bodies were not enveloped by membrane but were often surrounded by a more electron-dense shell at their periphery. Normal peripheral blood neutrophils contained an average of approximately one lipid body per cell. Lipid bodies appeared in greater numbers in neutrophils from inflammatory lesions. Perturbation of neutrophils during conventional methods of cell isolation and purification modestly increased lipid body numbers in neutrophils, whereas incubation of neutrophils with 1 microM oleic acid rapidly induced lipid body formation over 30 to 60 minutes. After granulocytes were incubated for 2 hours with 3H-fatty acids, including arachidonic, oleic, and palmitic acids, electron microscopic autoradiography demonstrated that lipid bodies represented the predominant intracellular sites of localization of each of the three 3H-fatty acids. There was lesser labeling noted in the perinuclear cisterna, but not in cell membranes. Virtually all of each of the three 3H-fatty acids incorporated by the neutrophils were esterified into chromatographically resolved classes of neutral lipids or phospholipids. These findings indicate that cytoplasmic lipid bodies are more prominent in neutrophils in vivo engaged in inflammatory responses and that these organelles in human neutrophils function as sites of deposition of esterified, incorporated fatty acids.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a health care plan which uses physicians as gatekeepers to control health services use and charges. New enrollees in United Healthcare (UHC), an independent practice association, were randomly assigned to the standard UHC plan requiring a gatekeeper, or to an alternate plan with equal benefits but without a gatekeeper. Individuals in both plans were similar in demographic characteristics, perceived health status, and other health insurance coverage. The gatekeeper plan had 6 percent lower total charges per enrollee than the plan without a gatekeeper. There were minor differences in hospital use and charges. Ambulatory charges were $21 lower per person per year in the plan with a gatekeeper (95% CI = -39.9, -2.1) and these were due to .3 fewer visits to specialists (95% CI = -0.50, -0.10). We conclude that a health plan which incorporates incentives and penalties for physicians to act as gatekeepers can reduce the cost of ambulatory services by limiting specialist visits.\r"

Eighty-nine Trypanosoma cruzi strains, isolated by xenodiagnosis, were characterized by 12 isoenzyme loci and were related to the presence of cardiac changes and enteric disease with megacolon. There was a high heterogeneity of human zymodemes, presenting evidence of 2 predominant zymodemes genetically dissimilar from each other and ubiquitous in Bolivia. The frequencies of these predominant zymodemes among strains from patients were compared to strains from triatomine bugs previously studied. We observed mixtures of different zymodemes within the same patient, a phenomenon seen previously in Bolivian patients. There was no apparent difference of pathogenicity between the 2 more frequent zymodemes isolated from humans.\r"

  ".W": "To search for the sequential compromise of the spinal cord, nerves, and skeletal muscle in mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, animals were subjected to electromyographic investigation, end-plate recordings, and histological studies at 7, 15, 37, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, and 360 days postinfection. Electromyographic studies showed signs of motor unit remodeling as early as 15 days postinfection, when diminished duration and amplitude of motor unit potentials pointing to a primary muscle involvement were found. Thereafter, certain features of denervation, reinnervation, and primary muscle involvement were often found to coexist. Low miniature end-plate potentials with normal frequency and acetylcholine quantum content were found in end-plate recordings made at the phrenic-diaphragm in vitro. Double end-plate potentials were observed in most of the tested muscle fibers from day 90 postinfection. All these features suggest post-synaptic damage of the end-plate and the presence of reinnervation after day 90 postinfection. Histological studies disclosed inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages, with vasculitis as the main lesion in the hamstring muscles; intracellular parasites were seen in 25% of the cases. Neuropathic features, as expressed by type fiber grouping and grouped muscle fiber atrophy, were found. On nerve examination epineural, perineural, and endoneural vasculitis were seen. Digestion chambers and myelin ovoids (axonal degeneration) were observed. In teased fiber preparations, segmental internodal and paranodal demyelination and remyelination were found. The lumbar inflammatory spinal cord failed to show grey or white matter infiltrates. However, spinal roots and dorsal root ganglia were densely affected by inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".W": "A histopathological and immunofluorescence (IMF) study of the choroid plexus was performed in 8 cases of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni and in 20 cases which had resulted in death with no evidence of liver or brain involvement by schistosomiasis or other disease process, and in which renal disease and arterial hypertension were also excluded (control group). IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C1q were investigated. Positive IMF in the choroid plexus was found in 75% of the schistosomiasis group. IgA and IgG were the immunoglobulins (Ig) most frequently found. C3 was also commonplace. Histologic examination of the choroid plexus showed changes in 87.5% of the schistosomiasis group. The most frequently found change was characterized by focal, linear, occasionally nodular, subepithelial deposition of a homogeneous, acidophilic, and PAS positive substance, apparently in relation to the epithelial basement membrane, with thickening of this structure. In the control group, the IMF in the choroid plexus was negative in all cases, and only 2 cases (10%) presented histopathological changes of the choroid plexus with a pattern similar to that of the schistosomiasis group. The demonstration of the deposition of Ig and fractions of the complement system, and of histological changes in the choroid plexus in a liver disease which is known to exhibit circulating immune complexes and glomerulopathy with deposition of Ig and fractions of the complement system suggests an etiopathogenetic relationship between both findings.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from humans with chronic Schistosoma mansoni infections (CHS) were chromatographed with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B conjugated with NP-40 extracts obtained from live 3 hr schistosomula. Both unbound (CHSUB) and bound (CHSB) fractions which contained IgG and IgM isotypes were characterized by ELISA, immunofluorescence, and complement-mediated in vitro killing assays. ELISA data showed that the CHSB fraction recognized schistosomula NP-40 extracts, whereas the CHSUB fraction did not. However, both CHSUB and CHSB fractions recognized 8 M urea adult worm extracts and 8 M urea egg extracts. By indirect immunofluorescence assay, the CHSB fraction recognized epitopes on the surface of live schistosomula 3 hr-29 days of age, whereas the CHSUB fraction showed surface fluorescence only on 24- and 29-day-old worms. The CHSB fraction mediated 95% killing of schistosomula in a complement dependent in vitro assay, the CHSUB fraction and the unfractionated CHS did not exhibit killing ability. The CHSUB fraction was able to titrate out the killing ability of the CHSB fraction in in vitro cytotoxic assays when mixed with the CHSB fraction at increasing concentrations. In passive immunization experiments, the CHSB fraction provided approximately 30% passive protection in mice when injected 1 day or 6 days after challenge and 20% protection when injected at 15 days, but failed to provide protection when administered greater than or equal to 24 days after challenge. Unfractionated CHS failed to mediate passive protection.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the presence of the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) in the urine of schistosomiasis patients. This genus specific antigen was hitherto demonstrated only in the serum of schistosomiasis patients. The urine of 80 patients with Schistosoma mansoni infections, 33 patients with S. haematobium infections, and 2 patients with mixed S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections were screened by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CAA was demonstrated in 81% of those with intestinal schistosomiasis and in 97% of those with urinary schistosomiasis. CAA titers were less than 1:0.2-1:51.2. Results were compared with circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) titers in urine obtained in an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). CCA was generally not detectable in the urine of patients with S. haematobium infection, but was demonstrated in the urine of 85% of the patients with S. mansoni infection. Both CAA titers and CCA titers correlated positively with the number of S. mansoni eggs excreted in the feces, but CAA titers did not show a significant correlation with the number of S. haematobium eggs in urine. Both antigen titers showed a moderate correlation with the serum CAA level in schistosomiasis mansoni. The discovery of CAA in the urine of the majority of schistosomiasis patients tested suggests the use of urine samples for non-invasive immunodiagnosis of the disease.\r"
